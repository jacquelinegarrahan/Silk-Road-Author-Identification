The specific kind of unreason we call religion has been with us for so long that we have generally been convinced that religious thinking is both harmless and necessary. This is a claim that has absolutely no logical standing in the modern world, and we deny this at our own peril.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">But if people are religious and wish to keep their beliefs then what harm does it do us? None at all.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: abitpeckish</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Off the top of my head: suicide bombings, genital mutilation, murderous xenophobia, genocide, slavery, The root causes of human acceptance of these atrocities is not religion, specifically, but unreason. Religious thinking, however, is fundamentally unreasonable and therefore is vulnerable to the recurrence of such horrors.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">That is extremism, even though it may be do to with religion, It is extremism and is not practiced&nbsp; by the the religious temples, churches synagogues etc, but violent factions. Religion itself is not about killing others and the things you have mentioned, As i said earlier as well, The church has been responsible for Thousand of murders, slavery and much more, Though this was in the past, And this was not the same of all religions. This was also in the past where slavery was prominent anyway, Not that is any excuse for a religion which is meant to help people though.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not just extremism, it&#039;s dogmatism. Dogmatism is unreason in its purest and most dangerous form. What is it that you&#039;re defending here? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As long as they are learning with an open mind and not just with religious views. So yes as long as the beliefs do not effect the way you act in a negative way fine. But what about if religion makes somebody act better? Its a double edged sword.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To paraphrase Sam Harris: if religion ever gets anything right regarding questions of this sort, it is only by accident. Believing right things for the wrong reasons is quite plainly dangerous.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are you trying to say that if you start dictating that people cannot believe in something it is not fascism?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. Nor am I saying that people are not allowed to believe in absurdities. I am simply saying that we must stop allowing these absurdities to enter into the intellectual territory of questions that quite obviously involve the experiences of conscious beings in this world.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your [sic] speculating on everything so broadly, I never said that &quot; one fascist or even totalitarian society that became so because its people became less dogmatic and more committed to reason.&quot; but i tell you that if you control people and tell them what they can and cant believe in it becomes fascism fact. Also people would start revolting against whoever was doing so and it would slow progress down not speed it up in any way.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed, which is why I would never promote such a thing. We&#039;re going to have to become more committed to reason one by one.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How would it be fairly straightforward?&nbsp; id love to hear it, if you are right , i take my hat off to you,&nbsp; And let&#039;s implement it asap.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In practice, we could definitely fix this problem. If this species were to wake up to its circumstances and begin to be reasonable, we could make it so situations like this simply will not exist. There may always be psychopaths and sociopaths among us, but we can likely mitigate the destructive behaviors if we can identify them and enrich them during cognitive development. The ones that still act destructively we would then simply institutionalize.<br /><br />The crux of the problem here lies in the fact that homo sapiens is still constantly tricked by its own cleverness, and we are resultingly a highly intelligent but stupidly acting species. All human behavior is causal, and belief is one of the strongest motivators of human behavior. As long as we continue to believe ridiculous things, we will never even be able to begin solving problems like pedophilia.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: HeatFireFlame</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">your definition of conscious beings is wrong, Everybody is conscious whether they believe in absurdities or not. But if you mean that religious theories must not be involved in scientific matters then i agree as they are only delaying&nbsp; things for us a human race.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please tell me how my definition of conscious beings is wrong. You seem to be under the impression that I believe religious people aren&#039;t conscious. This is untrue.<br /><br />----------<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: jundullahi</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well is Islam is based upon reason.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wait...you&#039;re serious? Alright well...let&#039;s see how this goes...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: jundullahi</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you prove that God exist? Well if you reason every thing created must have a creator. Right?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wrong. All of existence is causally interrelated. This is not the same as saying things are &quot;created&quot; or have &quot;creators&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: jundullahi</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So this world is here. So it must come from some where right. This world is too complex to have come in existence<br />by pure change.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We know where it comes from, thanks to the past ~400 years of application of the philosophy of science. It is not &quot;too complex&quot; for any such thing, and you must back up this claim before you can move further from this starting position.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: jundullahi</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are more rational based arguments in Islam. This is only one of them<br />Ones I a had a debate with a Christian about God having a son. I asked how can God have a son because is did and still does not make any sense to me. She replied you just have to believe that. That what I call blind faith.<br />Do you want to know more</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If what you have said so far is indicative of what you consider to be &quot;reason&quot;, then no I don&#039;t need to know any more. It is more than reasonable to simply dismiss your arguments as incoherent.<br /><br />(edit: Sorry about misspelling your handle, jundullahi.)

As long as we allow unreason (e.g. religion) to assert itself within discussions regarding human well-being (poverty, health, ethics, economics, international relations, etc), we will fail to find solutions that make real progress toward the flourishing of conscious beings in the universe. <br /><br />News flash to humanity: Even if we were to survive our current religiously-entangled predicaments—suicide terrorism, equality, climate change—, which is doubtful, the sun is going to kill us if we stay here. We&#039;re going to have to leave this fucking planet. (and we&#039;re probably going to want to bring at least the conscious organisms along for the ride) We have enough information to know this. For a fact. Contemplate; truly contemplate this fact for a moment. Do you think we&#039;ll ever be able to do this if we&#039;re constantly having to deal with people killing each other over disagreements about which iron age, pre-scientific, irrational, and culturally inherited accounts of existence (all of it) are the perfect, complete, unerring truth?

				Not all are money scams, but I do believe most if not all are POWER SCAMS. people can never really understand this for some reason always saying, &quot;Well why the hell ever would they go and do that? No motive nonsense&quot; When I can see a CLEAR and present shift of power being created. Human beings are much more powerful than we are led and learn to believe. If we could all just open up our eyes, or in other words, lift this &quot;heavy fog&quot; we would be able to do so much more for this single, tiny planet we call home. In the past couple years, it is making itself evident that we will not be able to escape this &quot;brute-like&quot; consciousness we have so deeply decented. But, I always stay positive, as we all should!

				I will reaffirm my position from the other post if I must... but I&#039;ll take a shorter route for now.<br /><br />We do not know everything. That is the most truthful thing that any situation, no matter your religion or lack thereof, must accept. Some of us may like to think we do, but we don&#039;t. We don&#039;t know what was before the big bang, we don&#039;t know precisely how life started on earth - or when it started for that matter. There are many, many questions that remain unanswered. We have theories, but as even Hawking admits - some questions just don&#039;t have answers until other criteria and/or steps are achieved.<br /><br />One of the greatest gifts I have received over the past few years in opening my mind and taking journeys with others, is an understanding of something a bit more than the jaded idea I had coming out of highschool. Reconciling the beliefs in a God, any God, with the realities of science, were very difficult for me as a kid. And, to be honest, my opinion itself is still mostly science, but that doesn&#039;t account for everything.<br /><br />In these various moments, I have heard many people of many faiths, discuss the very concept of life itself. It&#039;s not unusual, particularly given the other things we were doing besides talking. The thing that came across as enlightening though, is that in these discussions - ultimately all come to a similar conclusion, while the avenue may simply be different. Maybe you believe we came here by comets with bacteria on them in a lucky strike, or perhaps there were highly advanced pilgrims that seeded the planet. Maybe it was a god, maybe it was a traveler... or maybe it just happened. Whatever the case, this happened billions of years ago, and even the various astrobiologists that constantly examine even the strangest life on our planet that lives in conditions similar to the past cycles of earth.. admit that even when we think we know, the truth is almost impossible to prove.<br /><br />This is an extreme example, but the message is there. In order to understand that which has no explanation, we naturally provide one that allows for a reconciliation of the phenomena. Religious dogma, almost exclusively, spawned from this very human construct... our desire to explain that which we do not understand. Yes, this makes a reasonable portion of the explanations obsolete, but it hardly makes religion useless. Where you may be able to understand the astronomical significance of a 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 chance 4.3 billion years ago that ultimately led to our genesis, that does not mean someone else can too. And, there is proof for neither story... so which does it make right?<br /><br />We teach children through the use of symbolism and imagery that identifies with their younger, imaginative minds. Does this make the concepts of morality that is driven through some of these concepts, is also obsolete for children? I have yet to encounter scientific theory for why being a good person helps a scientific field. In some cases, these are concepts avoided in scientific communities, as to get the answer may require some immoral methods.<br /><br />The extremes of religion are not caused by religion, they are caused by people, and those same people have equal affects on science. There are examples all throughout history, but there is an extremely recent one. There were Italian geologists and seismologists that went so far as to publish as fact that an earthquake was NOT going to happen, and that any evidence of the sort was a lie. The evidence, which was based upon observable patterns and lead up energy releases that were measurable even within the day before the event, ended up being true - even as those scientists continued to advocate that people were completely safe. They are now in jail, charged with crimes related to the deaths of those that believed the scientists rather than the rest of the world that were telling them to evacuate.

It is a non sequitur. The rate at which religions are gaining in adherents does not necessarily speak to the coherence of its claims.

				If I labeled my belief as a &quot;religeon&quot; if you wanna call it that, it would simply be the religion of Earth. We all originate and are working living parts of a larger LIVING &quot;organism&quot; if you will. If you open up your mind and connect yourself with the Earth and all its wonderful creation, you feel this feeling shine through your being more true than any other &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;idea&quot; out there. Unfortunately people do not know how to do this much anymore, myself included(Although I am trying to reconnect). We have been truely cut off from our extremely deep connection with the Earth, and people do not understand what life means any more for this very reason. You wonder why people are always questioning and so confused about, well what does life mean? who created us? why are we here? On and On, when If you really focus on your life, and used the abilities every human has but is held dormant, You could discover whole new truths about your existence then you could even begin to comprehend before. I dont know, I am just rambling now but what I feel is a gist of &quot;true religion&quot; And I dont understand why people think there has to be this ultimate meaning to life, like everthing happens for a reason, because our world is literally so random and chaotic you can not even begin to organize things in a way like that. Things do not happen for a deeper mysterious reason, Things happen by chance. We happened by CHANCE. This is the very reason the topic is so &quot;mysterious&quot; to people. Because of how much of a miracle it seems we are here, yet also not at the same time because there are millions of other planets in the right distance of stars to support life like that on Earth. And In that respect I also do not believe conditions have to be so similar to Earth to produce life. I think it is totally possible for life to form on another planet that is for example, based on another element other than carbon. Most people think this would be impossible, but why? Why would this be impossible when the only life we have been able to study is that of our own Earth. And sure, it makes totall sense for life to be based off Carbon chains on Earth because of the way they work, and THE EARTH IS NATURALLY FULL OF CARBON! So of course life is going to form around this element, why would it not?? Energy takes the path of least resistance with any experiment you could create. This is very true with life energy too. Why do you think celestial bodies like planets, and stars are all mostly perfect spheres?? Because that is the most energy effecient way for them to form in the universe. Same reason water droplets come out round. These truths are all around us, and can even be tapped into with a strong enough brain. I fear that humanity is so isolated from its ties to the Earth, we are going to be the cause of its next major extinction. I only hope that whenever the world may end, that ALL of humanity is completely wiped out, allowing a clean slate to begin again, because surely, if we survive, we will just ruin it again... =(

That is the most truthful thing that any situation, no matter your religion or lack thereof, must accept. Some of us may like to think we do, but we don&#039;t. We don&#039;t know what was before the big bang, we don&#039;t know precisely how life started on earth - or when it started for that matter. There are many, many questions that remain unanswered. We have theories, but as even Hawking admits - some questions just don&#039;t have answers until other criteria and/or steps are achieved.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />100% agreed. Not only do we not know everything, we cannot know everything. This is simply a fact about the nature of our place within existence. We simply do not have access to the cosmos in its entirety. The details of our existence by definition prevent us from ever fully knowing the answers to some questions about that existence. However:<br /><br />1. these questions still have correct answers<br />2. some of the answers we do come up with will be worse than others<br />3. we can reasonably know when answers are bad or inferior to other answers<br />4. we can and should upgrade our beliefs by constantly removing all unreasonable claims about existence<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[...] Reconciling the beliefs in a God, any God, with the realities of science, were very difficult for me as a kid.

While the human endeavors of science (chemistry, anthropology, etc) cannot account for &quot;everything&quot;, it is more than clear that &quot;everything&quot; is a system bound by rules.&nbsp; Existence has structure. There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena. Most of all, the fact that human understanding is certainly limited does not render supernatural belief any more credible. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[...] admit that even when we think we know, the truth is almost impossible to prove.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sure, but the conclusions you draw from this—religion and science are compatible, religion is not only harmless but good—are obviously unreasonable. Religions contain much reason, but they are also saddled with unreasonable claims of primacy. We can and should keep the useful pieces of religious wisdom, but to do so we must drop all claims of ultimate truth. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[...] Religious dogma, almost exclusively, spawned from this very human construct... our desire to explain that which we do not understand.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a claim that does not stand up to proof. You are claiming that religion &quot;spawned&quot; spirituality, when it is quite clear that this is not the case. We can reasonably know through evidence (see: Chauvet cave), that spiritual mankind existed well before any of today&#039;s mythologies. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Yes, this makes a reasonable portion of the explanations obsolete, but it hardly makes religion useless.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You seem to conflate religion with spirituality/self-transcendence. Once you realize that &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences can be had by most humans (and possibly other sentient beings), it should be clear that religion (mythology + dogmatic belief) at its very best is exactly as useful as any other great literary works of fiction. (see: The Iliad, Aesop&#039;s Fables, Moby Dick)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Where you may be able to understand the astronomical significance of a 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 chance 4.3 billion years ago that ultimately led to our genesis, that does not mean someone else can too. And, there is proof for neither story... so which does it make right?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not about which idea is 100% completely right, it&#039;s about which incompatible ideas are better or worse. It is crystal fucking clear that no religion offers a remotely coherent explanation of existence, and it&#039;s through the application of reason (science) that we have reached a level of understanding that makes this clear. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We teach children through the use of symbolism and imagery that identifies with their younger, imaginative minds.

In some cases, these are concepts avoided in scientific communities, as to get the answer may require some immoral methods.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This field of inquiry is definitely avoided by most scientists, which is a significant failing of science so far. We have allowed religion to convince us that a scientific, reasonable approach cannot help us understand morality. We have to stop doing this. Reason is the only path through which we can reliably move toward the best understanding of critically important things like morality, just as it is the only path through which we can gain a continually improving understanding the universe.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The extremes of religion are not caused by religion, they are caused by people, and those same people have equal affects on science. There are examples all throughout history, but there is an extremely recent one. There were Italian geologists and seismologists that went so far as to publish as fact that an earthquake was NOT going to happen, and that any evidence of the sort was a lie. The evidence, which was based upon observable patterns and lead up energy releases that were measurable even within the day before the event, ended up being true - even as those scientists continued to advocate that people were completely safe. They are now in jail, charged with crimes related to the deaths of those that believed the scientists rather than the rest of the world that were telling them to evacuate.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not a failure of the philosophy of science. You said it yourself, this is a failure of people. Furthermore it is a failure of those people to make decisions and act according to a commitment to truth.

How could it not? Given what humanity has already come to know about the cosmos, no religion has the best answers to all the questions in this category of thought. Therefore, none of them are perfect or unerring. Yet they explicitly claim to be exactly this. This is how we can easily know that religion is not useful to accept as true, even though some conclusions drawn in the context of religion are true. Again, when religion gets answers to these questions right, it does so either by accident or due to reasoning that does not require religious faith.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And have using the basic logic that every thing created does not make you thing that there must be a creator.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, a causal universe is not by necessarily a created universe.

There are numerous pieces of good wisdom, legitimate knowledge, and true reason contained within most religions, but they are also full of explicitly wrong claims about existence, sadistic laws and practices, bizarre obsessions regarding sexual behavior, and generally unreasonable conclusions about how humans should behave.<br /><br />Again, we don&#039;t need to believe unreasonable things in order to live full, happy lives in harmony with each other. In today&#039;s world, it is precisely this kind of belief that presents (both expicitly and implicitly) a threat to the survival of our species and possibly even all life on Earth. <br /><br />I wish you all the best as well, but only in this life.

				I&#039;m not a big supporter of organized religion. the followers are just too much like sheep then. I personally believe everyone should find their own peace with whatever form of god they themselves feel works for them. for me: God is just a chill guy who&#039;s going to let me enter heaven (or gives me whatever reward he gives to the good guys) as long as I&#039;m a good person. That&#039;s because I can&#039;t accept that an atheist that dedicates his life to helping others is going to hell while a christian/muslim/jewish rapist is going to heaven just because they believed or didn&#039;t believe in the right religion. A friend of mine thinks god is some sort of energy source. that&#039;s his personal relationship with his interpretation of god, and as long as that helps him feel better in any way, my reaction is: sure, good for him.

You can find a free copy maybe at your local mosque. <br />And if you have not read the Quran (in its correct translation) then I dont thing you are speaking with real knowledge. <br />Miracles Of The Quran Documentary English Full Part 1/4 2011 HD&nbsp; go watch this if you dare. <br /><br />And if you believe that design needs designer is not not rational prove for the existence of a designer.<br />Well then I dont see any point the continuation of this discussion. <br />Because I how many examples I would bring if you just simple refuse the think it might be possible that God exist well then. This is the end.<br /><br />I still you wish you the best. <br /><br />Go watch the miracles of the Quran.<br /><br />Just some friendly advice.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In my opinion, All religions may be different but some like Islam , Judaism and Christianity all have some similarities. <br /><br />&quot;If people believe in the fact that God created the everything and created the first two human. And we are all their descents. So then we are all brother and sister. Would you kill your brother? I surely would not. &quot; So no matter who you have children with it&#039;s incest? <br /><br />&quot;The Quran challenges people to think and ponder the nature of creation.&quot; How can it challenge people to think about the nature of creation, if it tells you that god created things? even if it tells you to ponder them surely it tells you to ponder them with the fact that god created things included. <br /><br />Also islam is the most misunderstood religion in the world, Especially by a lot of muslims who follow it. It is the biggest cause of religious deaths in the 21st century. Biggest cause of woman&#039;s rights violations and&nbsp; in more ways that 1 lives in the past. Also what i mean by misunderstood by many who follow it is that there are many people who are muslims, but do not understand the way the quran was meant to be followed, And it is very easy to misinterpret things that are mentioned in the quran. <br /><br />on op of it all you have to remember that these books were written thousands of years ago when science was not as advanced as it it now, and cultures were much different. If you were to follow the original bible to a tee, and follow the original transcripts of the Quran you would most certainly get arrested for something or another.<br /><br />I live in a fairly multicultural area, and a lot of the Muslims that live around here think that Christianity and the UK and America are &quot;out to get them&quot;. And i dont understand why if they think it so much and are so radical about their beliefs and hate for the country&#039;s they live in why they dont go back to their own country. Now im not racist, I have friends of all faiths, But i can tell you from first hand experience, Jews are a lot more tolerant of Muslims than vice versa. Also, If i was to say something about islam i would be accused of being racist, but however i often hear people from the east &quot;down talking&quot; white people as a whole and it is clearly racist, but the police would call it freedom of speech.<br />The uk and america are very tolerant, if you were to say these things in a muslim country you would be fucked. Unfair trial the whole lot. <br /><br />Everybody white i know would never go to a muslim country with their girlfriends,daughters or wives, and those that have regret it because they go throguh markets etc and muslims are still trying to buy the girls and grab them touch them up as they go to look around the country or market.&nbsp; They still sell and buy people that is just one instance of them living in the past. I for one would never in my life take y girlfriend there because of the fact that she would probably be kidnapped. That frustrates me.

Creativity is a feature of human consciousness, and some human brains are more adept at it than others. Being rational is a goal, not a state. We cannot reasonably expect to be 100% reasonable. It&#039;s just not how we&#039;re built. Rationality is the framework with which we can hold ourselves responsible for the consequences of our thoughts, decisions, and actions. We cannot process all the information of the universe as it occurs, so we develop shortcuts to draw conclusions, make predictions. Reason is the practice of honing the effectiveness of these skills, and we can be better or worse at it. Creativity just happens, it&#039;s inherent in the nature of thought. You don&#039;t have to try to think in order to think thoughts, and the same goes for creativity.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As regards to Science and Morality, Science can explain where our sense of morality comes from as it can also tell us where our sense of beauty comes from but science cannot tell us if an action is moral no more than it can tell us if a painting is beautiful.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It can, and it does. Once you allow that &quot;the maximum flourishing of all conscious beings&quot; and &quot;the maximum amount of suffering of all conscious beings&quot; are reasonable peaks and valleys on a spectrum of well-being, morality follows through scientific thinking alone.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also if you accept the fact that there can be one thing that didn&#039;t require a creator (The creator himself) that leads logically to the fact that there could be more than one thing that didn&#039;t need a creator which in turn leads to the idea that nothing needed a creator (which is pretty much the truth).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ll point out again that &quot;God&quot; is borne of the ego illusion (the Self). Take a moment and try to observe the thoughts running through your mind. Stop them. Think no thoughts. Can you do it? For how long? If you can&#039;t stop your brain from thinking thoughts, where are those unwanted thoughts coming from, and who is &quot;you&quot; anyway?

				@abitpeckish<br /><br />There are no direct studies done into whether or not an excess of rationality stifles creativity however neuroscientists have noticed a correlation between an excess of rationality in conditions along the autism spectrum from severe autism to high functioning aspergers to a lack of creativity. Certain types of autists (the so-called idiot savants) can give incredible renderings of musical compositions created by others and yet are incapable of writing the most lacklustre original composition that would be well within the capability of much less musically gifted &#039;normal&#039; people.<br />They can produce incredibly detailed drawings that are almost photographic in detail but cannot produce any art that comes from their own imagination. The least talented of &#039;normal&#039; children can do a drawing of something they have devised themselves.<br /><br />Other work done with people who have suffered damage to their pre-frontal lobes destroying the emotional centres but leaving the rational centres intact have shown that these people can&#039;t make the simplest of decisions for example choosing between to similar products in a supermarket. A lot of high functioning aspergers who are capable of great feats of logical reasoning similarly had extreme difficulty in making simple decisions in their everyday life. Paul Dirac one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century (probably next only to Einstein) was a very typical example of this.

Unfortunately people do not know how to do this much anymore, myself included(Although I am trying to reconnect). We have been truely cut off from our extremely deep connection with the Earth, and people do not understand what life means any more for this very reason.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can learn to access this kind of truth through meditation. For most people, spiritual experiences are both extremely rare and occur at random. Many people even complete their entire lives without once experiencing the connection of self-transcendence that you are talking about. I find this to be tragic. Most humans not only have the biology necessary for spiritual experience, but through meditation* we can teach ourselves how to reliably enter that state. Furthermore, we can do this without adopting unreasonable beliefs. <br /><br />* Meditation is a hell of a lot of work. Thankfully, we can more easily establish a &quot;proof of concept&quot; to the untrained through psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, etc<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You wonder why people are always questioning and so confused about, well what does life mean? who created us? why are we here?

This obsession seems to me quite natural, given the nature of human consciousness. We cannot help but think new thoughts. Combine this with the character of our intelligence, and we&#039;re booted up into what seems to itself as a fully formed subject (personality).

And In that respect I also do not believe conditions have to be so similar to Earth to produce life. I think it is totally possible for life to form on another planet that is for example, based on another element other than carbon. Most people think this would be impossible, but why? Why would this be impossible when the only life we have been able to study is that of our own Earth. And sure, it makes totall sense for life to be based off Carbon chains on Earth because of the way they work, and THE EARTH IS NATURALLY FULL OF CARBON! So of course life is going to form around this element, why would it not?? Energy takes the path of least resistance with any experiment you could create. This is very true with life energy too. Why do you think celestial bodies like planets, and stars are all mostly perfect spheres?? Because that is the most energy effecient way for them to form in the universe.

Planets, stars, celestial bodies, etc are not &quot;mostly perfect spheres&quot;. Not by a long shot. There is no good reason to take your line of thinking past the point of reason, and this makes others either suspicious of your thought process or tricked into believing untrue things.

The thought of even one person reading this thread having an epiphany–a momentary glimpse of the simple truth and beauty of conscious existence, a realization that both your mind and body exist within the same medium, the fundamentally NON-dual nature of mankind–triggered by a deeply truthful assessment of what it is like to exist...this is what motivates me. We can reconnect with our nature, and we can do it entirely within the framework of logic and reason.

				Lots of good points abitpeckish, and when I said the whole spherical thing, I mean obviously nothing is perfectly shaped EVER, but generally the form which matter shapes in space is sphere-like. But +1 to you for sure, Meditation is very important, and it actually kinda sucks that one of only ways people can learn &quot;these truths&quot; in this day and age is through psychadelics. I do remember one of my good &quot;hippie&quot; friends explaining to me how one could learn to create &quot;psychadelic experiences&quot; for themselves without actually needing to ingest a chemical. I just remember thinking wwhat he was saying sounded so awesome, as of course he went into a much deeper explanation, of which I cannot remember, nonetheless interesting.

I&#039;m not going to bother with the rest of what you said.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry, but you&#039;re wrong.&nbsp; Please read a physicist&#039;s description of quantum mechanics next time, not a religious nut&#039;s.

				Well your first whole half of your post goes along exactly with what I am trying to say, and Full true Physicists and Full true Quantam mechanicists (lol real word?) Have many points on which they believe almost total opposites, I think they need to be melded together to form a true understanding of the universe. And yes, every single drop of energy in the universe is completely and totally interconnected all effecting eachother under Neutons 3rd law of physics. Sorry if it seems I am not thinking of others opinions, but when I mentally connect to this energy I can literally FEEL this. But regardless of all this, you should check out the info on the famous DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT, It will blow your mind if you have not heard of it yet, and really challenge your comprehension, haha almost couldnt follow the ideas brought forth with how high I was.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Lol when we die we all return to the &quot;mother energy mass&quot; or whatever the fuck you&#039;d wanna call it, thats why people believe in reincarnation, because energy is infinitely recycled, thats pretty much how the universe ends, athiests do not believe in total blackness, but they do not bend down to believe completely and totally another persons ideas without first unobjectively experiencing the theories and ideas for themselves. And your whole computer game to life perfection analogy is completely flawed and in my mind not valid reasoning in any aspect. Sorry, not bashing you, but I think if you were to use 3 words to most accurately describe the universe, perfect would definitely not be one, more like, RANDOMNESS, BEAUTYIFUL, CHAOS.&nbsp; I think the rise of life in the universe serves a way of gathering all this craziness and chaos and organizing it as efficiently as possible, lol that is just a random thought I literally just had though.

				Dude, the fact that that information was written in the Quran, then it was not unknown knowledge at the time by a long shot. Lol the people writing the passages in the book, from what you are saying, fully understood these &quot;science&quot; ideas. Only recently have human beings been able to actually rediscover a lot of truth&#039;s that we used to know. There was a point in our history where the &quot;great memory&quot; shared amongst our DNA and concsiousness pool, and physically through stories and records in time, was almost wiped clean. There are many many many different discoveries that have baffled around this. Just some food for thought, because you keep stating the Quran has scientific proofs in it not proven until recently, but this contradicts itself because the proofs WERE recorded, You have read it with your own eyes. Therefor it has already been proven and understood, yet obviously lost through time. Just think about that and apply the concept of it too how long we have allegedly been here. You can literally sit here for years straight without even getting up debating all the ins and outs of your ideas and beliefs, but none of them will ever be 100% true, It is nearly fucking impossible for a single human being to come across the complete truth in every single aspect of life, spirituality, and the likes. Rather you must combine peices of ideas from here and there, cascading through history to ever come close to building up a true understanding of all this deep shit. And even then would it never be able to reach 100%

				To fact were recorded while the were unknown because the Quran claims that it is a revelation for the Creator of the universe. So yes know human could every write and guess 100 percent of unknown scientific fact. <br />And its highly unlikely that those facts were discovered then lost in time. Because we have text some dating back 2500 years. If so those scientific discoveries were so important we would have evidence of there existent.<br />And about true 100 precent understanding. If you would accepted that God exists then it would not be so hard so reason that from His wisdom and Mercy He would have informed us about the nature of existent and about every aspect of this life be spirituality or any thing else

That is your opinion and what ever I can say the same thing about what ever you believe systems is based.<br /><br />The is a verse in the Quran that says that The Prophet Muhammed has been send to mankind as a Compassion.<br />And there is enough scientific fact in the Quran that where unknown in the time of its revelation. If you are in doubt go browse this website and read every thing then come back and continue on claiming that my believe system is based on nonsense. http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_index.html. If you reply with out reading it this will be my last reply to you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Alright then, let&#039;s have a go. I have chosen 4 examples.<br /><br />The relativity of time[1]: There is absolutely nothing scientific or even specific about the language in the cited examples. If the Quran had actually given us scientific knowledge, then we would have known about the specifics of relativity 1300 years before Einstein. Yet we didn&#039;t. This is what is meant by &quot;confirmation bias&quot;: you&#039;re taking scientific knowledge that has been painstakingly gained over centuries of methodical work and retrofitting them to vague passages in your holy book. <br /><br />The expansion of the universe[2]: Yet again, poetically imprecise language being labelled as science. Perhaps if the Quran said &quot;And it is We Who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it. [And you shall know Our work by its color when you measure the heavens.]&quot; MAYBE that would make a scientist look twice, but even that is so non-specific as to be impossibly vague. <br /><br />Sub-atomic particles[3]: This is quite obviously the product of translation(a), and the claim that the Quran is speaking about atoms is basically a lie. BUT, let&#039;s go ahead and assume that the concept of the atom was in fact intended. The concept of the atom was already 1000 years old when Muhammad was born(b), so the Quran wouldn&#039;t have been talking about anything new. Furthermore, Greek ideals and philosophies were spreading like wildfire during the first 400 years of the common era(c). Even if your holy book WAS literally speaking about atoms, it is more than plausible that this idea was given to proto-Islamic cultures hundreds of years before Muhammad ever walked the earth. <br /><br />Black holes[4]: Contemplation of light and darkness has existed for at least as long as we have had language. To equate these verses with the scientific concept of black holes is just ridiculous. <br /><br />Not only is the Quran (and the Bible, and the Bhagavad Gita, and The Iliad, etc) unscientific, but any attempts to make it appear scientific fail at the starting line. The most damning feature of the supposedly scientific parts of religious canons is the fact that they do not impart ANY specific, reproducible knowledge that wasn&#039;t already available to humanity during the eras in which they were written.<br /><br />[1] http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_32.html <br />[2] http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_02.html<br />[3] http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_36.html<br />&nbsp; (a) http://www.answering-islam.org/authors/katz/quran/science/atoms.html<br />&nbsp; (b) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#Atomism<br />&nbsp; (c) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy_and_Christianity<br />[4] http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_37.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But personally I think you have taken as a deity your own whims and ego and intellect. And there will be a day when we will know who is right and who is wrong. <br /><br />I wish you the best and may you be guided.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You may think that, but it isn&#039;t true. I claim no deities, and I absolutely do not trust my ego or intellect any further than seems reasonable. I understand that the nature of my existence means that my intuitions and readiness to believe propositions are fundamentally unreliable. When presented with reasonable, logical arguments that are incompatible with my beliefs, I work very hard to do the right thing: I change my beliefs. Thankfully I was lucky enough to come into existence during a period where the tools (logic, reason, scientific methods, skepticism) to overcome these shortcomings are not only available to us, but have been proven over centuries to reliably move us closer to understanding the true nature of existence.<br /><br />A time when humanity grows up and away from the confines of its superstitious, tribal nature is long overdue. The world in which we now co-exist is simply too dangerous for us to continue to hold these inflexible-by-definition religious beliefs. We can, and therefore should, wake up to these facts:<br /><br />1. We exist within a world bound by rules<br />2. We can use logic/reason to reliably learn more about these rules<br />3. In doing so, we can develop methods of approaching important subjects (morality, law, punishment, etc) that are flexible because they based on logic, reason, and a commitment to truth<br />4. A truly reasonable approach to understanding will enable us to make real progress toward maximizing the well-being of all conscious life, which when you get down to it is all that we can possibly be worried about.<br /><br />I hope you and any who read this thread will allow themselves to be open and honest enough to even just glimpse the realm of possibility available to a human species that holds itself, across the board, to a standard of reasonable belief.

				As the Quran is a book of sign for those that believe in a creator.<br /><br /><br />My approach is not a difference as you might think. It is such that some Islamic preacher are so strongly convinced about the truth of Islam that the for get that you should invite to Islam with wisdom and the best of manners. Al lot are also angry about the globalist intervention in the countries and there oppression and that shapes there worlds in a way. Islam is not out to oppress other or forcefully covert no-believer. <br />If this would be the case you would not find a single no Muslim in the Muslim world right. But there are large Christian and various of religions communities living in all over the Islamic world. For example in<br />Islamic Moorish Spain Jews, Christians and Muslim lived side by side peacefully until the Reconqista began and the Christian started forcefully converting everybody to Christianity or simply expelling those that did not want to. And a lot of Jews fled to Morocco and continued to thrive there or went crypto.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes there is a part about segregation between the communities like for example Beirut where you have Muslim neighborhoods and Christian neighborhoods. But in some sense that is logical. Would you not like to live amongst like minded people? <br />And in nation truly ruled by Islamic Law (there are no at the moment<br />) the communities that are no Muslim are living under Islamic protection and in case of war are not required to help defend to country. And the are allowed to keep there own place&#039;s of worship and are allowed to keep there own ideology and rule judge according to there own laws. <br /><br />And that it means that Muslim consider no Muslim infidels that does not mean we are out to kill or oppress them. Just a matter of opinion.<br /><br />Also I thank you for you understanding and I also have only the best intentions towards you.<br />And thank you to for being a good person.<br /><br />I wish you the best. <br /><br />PS. Harming or Killing a no-Muslim living under Islamic protection is a very serious crime in Islam. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				abitpeckish, I go along with most what you are saying, but I really do not understand what you are getting at with this last post, lol I dont think I have been that repetitive, and I am just sharing the beliefs I have in life mostly, some ideas inspired by the reading to obviously. I am not trying to get at the meaning of some major point or anything, I know what life is to me and how I relate to the universe through my own experiences just like everyone else, thing is everyones experiences are completely unique. Lol just saying we could sit here all day and try and force each others beliefs down each others throats. Lol I wish for the world to &quot;open its eyes&quot; mostly, but I do not feel like putting much more energy into this thread haha especially with jundu&#039;s posts lol.

				Earlier today it occurred to me that if heaven or hell from any religion actually do exist, they wouldn&#039;t be&nbsp; floating around in the sky or burning forever in the earth&#039;s crust. They would have to exist in an alternate dimension or on a different level of reality. In my opinion it&#039;s just as likely that the ancient Greek gods exist or that Odin and Thor are drinking mead in Asgard right now as it is that any of the major religions have it right. Greek and Norse mythology are both much more awesome than the current major world religions, so if I ever feel the need to become religious I&#039;m probably going to go with one of those. If nothing else, Bacchanalia, feasts, and drunken orgies beat the hell out of Christmas and Hanukkah, and bad ass drinking fighting viking gods are a lot better than an all knowing god that made Satan, created humans with free will, then throws everybody who doesn&#039;t meet impossibly high expectations into a burning pit for eternity. At least the Greek and Norse gods are pretty up front about being dicks half the time. The judeo christian god is a giant asshole, but everybody seems to pretend that he&#039;s all rainbows and sunshine. I just don&#039;t get it, it&#039;s like they pretend the old testament doesn&#039;t exist. I mean damn, what kind of asshole would give us strong sex drives, make some people gay, then declare sex outside of marriage and homosexuality to be offenses that deserve eternal damnation? Fuck that shit, I&#039;ll take Greek assholes or drunk vikings any day. At least then when there&#039;s a natural disaster it wouldn&#039;t just be &quot;god&#039;s plan,&quot;&nbsp; it would be &quot;Oh shit, Zeus is being a dick again. We better have some feasts in his honor and then get drunk and fuck a bunch of virgins so he&#039;ll quit that shit!&quot;<br /><br />As much as I hate Westboro Baptist, they&#039;re actually the most honest Christians I know of as far as going by what the Bible actually says. Real Christians should be stoning people to death for all sorts of shit, at least the extremist Muslims are serious about their beliefs and act on them. How many half assed pretend &quot;Christians&quot; do you know?

				Why would Law based on religion not be fair. If the people that enforce the laws are unfair then it those not matter with laws are unforced.<br />If the law in it self are just we can debate the finer details of those laws later.<br />In theory it should go like this. For example to become a US citizen one some one is a US citizen he would be required to obey the law of the US right? The same goes for some one how is Muslim.

Because women have an natural power of attraction of men. Like flower and bees. &quot; <br />Bullshit, Men are attracted to women and women attracted to men, Simple biology, nothing to so with flower and bees. The worst part of that statement is that you make it out as if women cant control themselves but men can? HAHA this is outrageous. the law was made up by some idiot whose wife cheated on him probably and he took it out on everybody ever since.<br /><br />&quot;Women are respected in Islam but not in the same way as the western world respects women.<br />Men and women are different psychologically and physiologically and there for have different roles in society&quot; <br />You are clearly biased against them, And think of them as second class citizens. Face it islamic law is a farce, Based on one sided ancient laws. <br />If we were to stick to ancient christian laws it would be shocking. that&#039;s why we changed them as the centuries went by, Unlike islamic law that hides behind &quot;tradition&quot;&nbsp; as an excuse to keep outdated laws in, Look it up. Chopping peoples hands of for theft is one haha. <br /><br />&quot;That alcohol and gambling is forbidden well. Those two thing can lead to great evil. Debt depression and violence and drunk driving with sometimes would result in death of innocent people. &quot;&nbsp; As i said defending your beliefs even though i dont believe them, Everybody has their rights to do what they wish as long as it does no harm to society, science or others. So gambling and drinking fine, Allow them, as long as they stay within limits, and dont commit crimes because of it then so what? <br />Another form of dictating what people do, That is not right and there is a lot of it in islamic law.

				First you must understand that there not a single country in the Islamic words that is ruled by the Sharia (Islamic Law). All of the governments are oppressive and dictatorial puppets of the NWO. And I do not support any of them nor do I justify there action. <br /><br />The Islamic Law does not hide behind tradition. Some people hide there tradition behind Islamic Law but that is different. Its comparable to Bush hiding behind the call for bringing democracy to Iraq but in fact only wanting the oil. You cannot blame a something if people chose to justify there unjust action with it. <br />And you might consider those laws outdated. But human nature has not changed over thousands of years. So these law will be relevant till the end of days. So does the emotional effect of not crime. not change with time. If a camel got stole the victim would feel the same as the victim of a car theft.<br />And about chopping of hand. That is an other subject yet the law does work and not every one that steals something gets there hand chopped off. There are curtain conditions that apply. If you for example steal because you are hunger you get to keep your hand. But if somebody steals more then he needs just pure for the sake of enriching him self on the expense of somebody else then he would so his hand. And he would be a example for there rest. <br />Imagine if also those rich banker who with out due right toke the wealth of other would get there hand chopped of would send a power message to the rest of them.<br />And like I said before there is nothing in Islamic Law that justifies the locking up of that couple. And I looked it up. <br />Well women are respect in Islam although you might not agree. <br />It is not that women cannot control them self you misunderstood me its that sometimes men cannot control them self. And women have an natural power of men. Again this is to prevent adultery. And this again is a difference of morals and values.<br /><br />Yes Islamic Laws are ancient but by no means outdated. There are enough people that want to be ruled by Islamic Law. But the puppet regime&#039;s of the Islamic world will not even all Islamic parties to participate in democratic elections. There a word for that oppression.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes Islam dictates to people how to live and how to behave. But so does any other system of government in some way or on other. Then at some point there will always be people who will oppressed. All though I believe is Islamic Law is the best would be the best law even in an such a society there will be people that are discontent for what ever reason. <br />In every society there will be people that are discontent because its just impossible to please everybody.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;I am perfectly contented with what Islam dictates to me, be honest, don&#039;t lie, don&#039;t scam people, always strife to do you best, pray, fast, do the hadj. And worship only the one worthy of worship. <br /><br />In the end if people want Islamic Law the must have the freedom to be ruled by it. Even if you or other do not agree. That would be a free world with out global oppression where every country and people can decided there own fate and chose there own way of life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will close my arguments with an verse from the Quran <br />Chapter 67 verse 29<br />Say: &quot;He is the Most Beneficent (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust. So you will come to know who is it that is in manifest error.&quot;<br /><br />I wish you the best. And I have enjoyed or nice and civil debate very much.<br />

				I&#039;m not religious by any means but sometimes it just strikes me odd that muslims have such a high respect for their religion. Let me ask you this then... When was the last time you seen a Christian suicide bomber? Oh wait what&#039;s that? You haven&#039;t ... ok then.<br /><br />Let me leave you with this.. the Boston Marathon Bombers where what religious background? Yep.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s wrong to base the actions of a few to judge the many but I&#039;m looking at the big picture at all the events that have happened in the past 15 years. 4 years a Muslim rebel group walked into a church in Iraq and murdered everyone in their in cold blood. Look it up if you think I&#039;m full of shit. The Christian religion is not pure and 100% untainted but at least that&#039;s not part of the Christian religion. <br /><br />You know we set here in our nice little homes and we&#039;re safe and secure and we can talk about how great a certain religion is and how beautiful it is. Do this and you&#039;ll see how Islam really is. If your white or a westerner move to Iran and practice your own religion. Watch how fast you will be perscuted and pressured to become Islam. It&#039;s not a choice there. It&#039;s your with us or againest.<br /><br />And btw if your such a good Muslim what you doing on a drug forum website. That&#039;s againest the Quran. Drugs, drinking,smoking...etc..

				Omg you guys are crazy. lol go fly a kite or something =) And for that one dudes post kant remember his name, You can learn a FUCKTON more about dreams and their meanings, and being able to understand the dreaming process more by exploring your dreams. Best way to explore the &quot;dreamscape&quot; is lucid dreaming, you can look up techniques to help you with this, but the best way to start getting intouch with your subconscious dream mind and stuff is by writing every single dream you can remember from the night before as soon as you wake up. Usually you will forget any dreams you can remember within 10 minutes of waking up because your brain automatically starts thinking about things you need to do that day. And for how birds know where they are flying (I assume like migrations and such) They simply use the temperature and length of the days to know what time to do it, and as for direction they actually use the Earth&#039;s electromagnetic field as a sort of built in GPS if you could imagine it. Once upon a time human beings were perfectly in tune with these Earthly forces, lol and the &quot;other realm&quot; where hell and heaven would be in is not in the physical dimension, but the metaphysical. That would pretty much be the same &quot;plane&quot; as you can reach when you successfuly astrally project, (my guess). That is why Shamans could allegedly travel to these &quot;spirit worlds&quot;. Lol but nowadays most people marvle at some &quot;mysteries&quot; that if we were&#039;nt so cut off from our Mother Nature, we wouldnt need to ask the question in the first place. This is my soul point of most posts in this thread lol. I may state it again, its interesting to see what people have to say in this thread though. I am just not going to argue with anyone =)

				Ok it&#039;s fine dude, I&#039;m not trying to attack you or anything. I&#039;m just so sick and tired of hearing about religion and which religion is right. But mostly of all I&#039;m disgusted looking at the aftermath of these wars which basically comes down to religion or power and sometimes both. <br /><br />I believe everyone has a basic human right to believe in what they want to believe. However once your belief starts to hurt others or you start to impose your own beliefs on others than it becomes a problem that no one should stand for.<br /><br />Does the American government practise the same hypocrisy they so vehemently oppose? Fuck yeah all the time. Look at the war in Iraq for example. That area is worse off since they brought their so called &#039;Democracy&#039;. Yeah? Why not go to Syria and do something while all those innocent people are dying because of one guy that needs to go. That place looks like a atomic bomb hit it.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t they take him out like they did Saddam Hussein? I&#039;ll let you draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />I have no problems with muslims, buddhists, christians, baptists... w/e it really doesn&#039;t mean that much to me. What matters is the actions and decisions you make so I judge people by that. I&#039;m completely aware of how naive and simplistic my view may be at times but I think it&#039;s better than condemning a whole race based on their religion. <br /><br />

Let me ask you this then... When was the last time you seen a Christian suicide bomber? Oh wait what&#039;s that? You haven&#039;t ... ok then.<br /><br />Let me leave you with this.. the Boston Marathon Bombers where what religious background? Yep.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s wrong to base the actions of a few to judge the many but I&#039;m looking at the big picture at all the events that have happened in the past 15 years. 4 years a Muslim rebel group walked into a church in Iraq and murdered everyone in their in cold blood. Look it up if you think I&#039;m full of shit. The Christian religion is not pure and 100% untainted but at least that&#039;s not part of the Christian religion. <br /><br />You know we set here in our nice little homes and we&#039;re safe and secure and we can talk about how great a certain religion is and how beautiful it is. Do this and you&#039;ll see how Islam really is. If your white or a westerner move to Iran and practice your own religion. Watch how fast you will be perscuted and pressured to become Islam. It&#039;s not a choice there. It&#039;s your with us or againest.<br /><br />And btw if your such a good Muslim what you doing on a drug forum website. That&#039;s againest the Quran. Drugs, drinking,smoking...etc.. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well you not religion do believe in Creator God?<br /><br />First the are allot of unanswered questions concerning the Boston Marathon Bombers. You can see it as an eye for an eyes tooth for a tooth. For all Iraq&#039;s Afghans that died and are still dying in America&#039;s crusade the bring &#039;&#039;democracy&#039;&#039;. I do not support it because I believe that the American &#039;&#039;democracy&#039;&#039; is not as democratic as we are all made out to believe. <br /><br />About the 4 Muslims that walked in to a church and shoot up the place. First its have to be proved that those were Muslims. Because it is know that an organization know as blackwater has conducted attack dressed as Muslims. Second if they were Muslims then they were violating Muslims Islamic Law and the teaching of the Prophet Muhammed how explicitly has forbidden attacks an places of worship. So that why I personally doubt that they where in deed Muslims. They might have been Shia Muslims. And there is a big difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims. <br /><br />Iranians are Shia and there are is a big difference between Shia and Sunni&#039;s. First they deny the authenticity of the Quran and most if not all teaching of the Prophet Muhammed. So Iran is a whole different story and is beyond the scope of this reply.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />According to Sunni&#039;s Islam there is now compulsion in religion. And that is why there a Christian communities living in Syria, Lebanon.<br /><br />Terrorism has existed long before 15 years ago. Ever heard of the IRA, RAF and some hindu&#039;s sect.<br />So in fact the terror attacks carried out be the Muslim is only a small percent. And I would say that the biggest terrorist at this moment with the police if you dont do what we say we bomb you is with out a doubt the USA. <br /><br />Well and violence not being part of Christianity. You must have been skipping you history class. Because have you ever heard about the Crusades the holy war the liberated the holy land form the infidels. Well that was very bloody ordeal. And when to Jerusalem was conquered the Christian killed every one if other Christian and blood ran knee deep trough its streets. So dont tell me that the Christian are an also peacefull people. There is more blood on Christian has then there ever will be on Muslim hands. <br /><br />And when the USA government and Israel with its globalist allies stop intervening in the other people countries then the I am sure the attack will stop. Like I said I do not support them but I understand why they do it. So feel attacked. <br />Its has said in the Quran. If they fight you fight them is they incline to peace you incline to peace.<br />Like for example the Palestinian the land has been stolen and that what remains in also being slowly and illegally taking away form them by illegal jewish settlers in the best bank. And the Gaza strip is regularly being bombed with also civilian shelter and mosques being specifically targeted by there air force. But you never heard about that or do you. If you house has been bombed you family killed. Well that would motivated some to get even. And martyrdom in Islam is of the greatest honors a Muslim can achieve.<br /><br />And about me being here. I am doing personal research on the effect of curtain drugs and how much the cloud the judgment. I do not claim that a very good Muslim I pray, I fast and worship none but the one deserving of worship. When there are misconception about Islam I have to try and straiten them out. And I believe a lot of people here who want to see the NWO go done and so do I. <br /><br />Please forgive more the tone of this post. Its 7 in the morning in Europe and I haven&#039;t sleep the night. <br /><br />If you want to know more please be free to ask.<br /><br />I wish you the best MAIH<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Most of the &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks in America are not even caused by radical Muslims. It is false flag propaganda people! The US Government wants to scare the shit out of its sheepish citizens, so they in turn run back to big daddy government to save them and keep them safe. And if what you say about Blackwater is true that is extremely fucking interesting because there were a lot of men dressed up in Blackwater traditional casual unifornm standing around the Boston Marathon, They all had backpacks and ear peices. Hmmmmm, wonder why... One of the most scariest Organizations in the world I would not fuck with is the US Government, They are some cold mother fuckers for real. I would love to immigrate from this currupted country, I will have to learn how and research a place that is not so highly effected by chemtrailing and crazy international political affairs.

				Well Jund I know a lot more about History than you may think. I&#039;m aware of the ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel which has been going on before you or me where on this earth. I&#039;m also aware of the on-going conflict between Shites and Sunnies and the distinct differences between them. I&#039;m aware of the Crusades and the results of that but then again I also stated in my reply that Christanity is not 100% untainted did I not? <br /><br />Ok I&#039;ll roll with your theory. Eye for an eye right? Check it out how about since those Muslims in Iraq shot up those innocent people in the church a group organizes and goes into a mosque and open fires? How does that sound to you? Eye for an eye right? They were in fact Muslims it was no conspiracy by the US Government lol... they could give two shits about Christians in Iraq. All they care about is the oil from the land to drive their precious SUV&#039;s to the office.<br /><br />Your reply to my post is a clear example of why ongoing conflict and tension will never cease in this world. I&#039;ve read the Quran. I&#039;m not Muslim. Please don&#039;t try to teach. I prolly know it better than you.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link to what I was talking about:<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING: http://www.christianpost.com/news/death-toll-from-iraqi-church-siege-shoots-up-to-52-47441/<br /><br />But I know what you&#039;ll say. You&#039;ll say well it&#039;s Al Qaeda they&#039;re an extremist group. Fair enough but their underlying beliefs and principles are based on the Quran and Islam. If Islam is so great answer me this question. Lebanon is just as dangerous as any other city in the middle east. Don&#039;t believe all the hype that everyone their is accepting. For the most part it is but you take a wrong turn somewhere you could be in for a bad bad night.<br /><br />Oh yeah have fun in Syria. Just make sure you look over your back to make sure no one tries to eat your heart..lol ..and have fun living in a third world country.<br /><br />P.S. This is a rather entertaining way to get my post count up =)

				Lol no thank you sir. Especially while the United States is covertly supplying the rebels with guns and money to throw russia off balance. I believe the mass amount of heroin being pumped into russia is also a direct result of narco-terrorism. Although I have not seen any articles or anything shedding much more light on the heroin problem I can give you a good guess of who&#039;s fucking behind it... Basically if US wants to hold its shit together they are really gonna have to worry about Russia and China. To bad the mother fuckers got Chavez, he was pretty strong too. Lol they could get me for treason for saying this shit! =O<br /><br />P.S. just cause I saw abitpeckish&#039;s post, made me think about one time I saw a guy get hypnotized in to doing what he completely and 100% thought was assassinating a man for no other reason than the hypnotist hypnotized him too! Fucking crazy that shit can happen, scary kind of. Of course they did a vigorous testing process on different people to get the most susceptible to hypnotism, and the gun was setup fake and shit. It was crazy though cause the dude didnt even fucking know anything about what he just did after it happened. He just followed the hypnotists orders exactly. SKEEEETCHHH

Best way to explore the &quot;dreamscape&quot; is lucid dreaming, you can look up techniques to help you with this, but the best way to start getting intouch with your subconscious dream mind and stuff is by writing every single dream you can remember from the night before as soon as you wake up. Usually you will forget any dreams you can remember within 10 minutes of waking up because your brain automatically starts thinking about things you need to do that day. And for how birds know where they are flying (I assume like migrations and such) They simply use the temperature and length of the days to know what time to do it, and as for direction they actually use the Earth&#039;s electromagnetic field as a sort of built in GPS if you could imagine it. Once upon a time human beings were perfectly in tune with these Earthly forces, lol and the &quot;other realm&quot; where hell and heaven would be in is not in the physical dimension, but the metaphysical. That would pretty much be the same &quot;plane&quot; as you can reach when you successfuly astrally project, (my guess). That is why Shamans could allegedly travel to these &quot;spirit worlds&quot;.

Oh right I forgot it&#039;s all a conspiracy so what had happened is someone put all those fake news links, articles, and stats.<br /><br />Not_A_Sheep you need to stop watching V for Vendetta cause shit in movies isn&#039;t always true in the real world. I greatly doubt the US goverment framed the Boston Marathon bombers. There&#039;s no motive and there&#039;s so much evidence and proof againest the two individuals(well one now) that it&#039;s damn near undeniable and never mind the fact he admitted it! Ok let&#039;s say he was framed.. how do you explain a shoot out with the police? Did you see the weapons they had? That was serious firepower and they knew what they fuck they were doing in regards to using their firearms and the explosives.<br /><br />The first clue that the FBI had was the MO of the bomb. Every bomb that&#039;s made has a signature if you will. They can tell by the way it&#039;s made what group it&#039;s from. That&#039;s not a type of bomb that is usually found in the Western world. It&#039;s a crude bomb that&#039;s relatively easy to make if you know what you&#039;re doing and it gives the attacker the most bang for their buck. No you should research the facts a bit and then come back or go watch some more V for Vendetta.

				Dear Miah. First in what language did you read the Quran and if you read in English what translation did you read it. And if you read it in Arabic then I wonder why aren&#039;t you Muslim. <br /><br />And I highly doubt you know the Quran better then me. I a part of it every day. Read it atleast 23 times in Arabic. And I speak read and write Arabic.<br /><br />PS and I am not an Arab.<br /><br />PS2 please forgive me for my false assumptions.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS3 You cannot blame the religion for if the people chose not to fallow its teachings.<br /><br />abitpeckish thank you for taking the time to read that little book if will get back on your post in detail later.<br /><br />Wish you all the best<br />And true success after death

				Why did we say the younger brother did it, then say he didnt, then say he did, then deport him!!!! And in light of the shootout, they say there was a shootout, yet there are news reports that say straightup there was no gun found in the boat! So it was a damn 1 sided shootout! And the U.S. would have a lot to gain in regards of certain carbon taxes, and weapons type restrictions. When you go back and look at the facts, like the fact that Russia said to the FBI a whole year before this shit even happened that they needed to look into the brothers because of their flight patterns. And if you look into it enough, you might even find some articles (If they arent fucking covered up) on how the FBI had the two brothers on their &quot;tracking list&quot; or whatever the fuck it is for 5 years prior to this shit. You really think the FBI, while getting paid what they do, didnt see this coming at all and were completely oblivious to the brothers movements? You dont fucking just shake the FBI dude, it doesnt happen. And before you start saying shit is exactly the way it seems, which it rarely ever is exactly, dig up as many news articles from the week after the bombing and tell me how much goddamn conflicting facts you will here. Its like a damn game of telephone. If you really analyze the shit from that day and the week after, you would be asking some major questions too. If our government would let 9/11 happen and the deaths of over 30 thousand people that fateful day, I am sure they would have no problem with this little bombing. Lol, you can even find the head of the FBI describing the MO of the bomb type, but then going on to say the situation does not add up to any terrorist attack. A legit terrorist would target a bus, or a stadium. Something closed in and highly populated. Idk, I am not trying to be all radical sounding and shit, but when you start to look around you and analyze EVERY SINGLE peice of information you recieve unobjectively, you start to see some crazy shit.. Like morgellons fibers, I do not want to get into this cause of course theres so much controversy regarding it, but it is 100% real, and people who dont believe in this mass abuse of the people are in denial. They need to go get their own fucking lab grade microscope and take their own skin samples. Lol I have.. and the findings are fucked up and unexplainable unless you start thinking up some science fiction shit, forreal it is not cool.

But something about it never sat right with me. For example: why does western culture commonly accept the notion that since (e.g.) honor killing[1] is a cultural practice, it therefore cannot be considered immoral? From what I can gather so far about you, I suspect that this might similarly bug you. Not coincidentally, this conclusion of moral relativism in modern liberal thought is not only very unsettling to religious people, it is one of the VERY few (perhaps the only) areas where religion seemingly has the high ground. This is not a victory for religion, however (e.g. see jundullahi&#039;s claims in this thread that boil down to moral relativism), but a &quot;simple&quot; failure to more fully apply our capacities of reason. What we have here is a failure to notice the values intrinsic to our nature, at least in part due to the fact that we just aren&#039;t very good at accepting that our subjectivities are bound by the same rules and systems that bind all of existence. <br /><br />1. We innately value truth as opposed to untruth, and the beliefs we form due to our calculations of truth/untruth inform everything we think/decide/do.<br />2. The subject (&quot;I&quot;) is a phenomenon of the universe, and is therefore *caused* by the cosmos.<br />3. There are facts that we can reasonably know about the cosmos, as it is structured.<br />:: There are facts that we can reasonably know about subjectivity. Another way of stating this would be that we can reasonably understand that some claims about what seem to be subjective ideas can be better or worse than others. Simply noticing this reality gives us all of the material we need to construct, maintain, and continually improve an objective morality oriented toward what we already value: truth.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Let this sink in for a moment, maybe even step away for a while and contemplate this.<br /><br />----<br /><br />The problem we&#039;re dancing around is that of moral ground, which I&#039;ll now address. To say that hurting people is not intrinsically &quot;wrong&quot; is to remove all meaning from the word &quot;wrong&quot;, as well as &quot;harm&quot;. The fact that harming yourself/others makes you, and MOST humans, subjectively feel bad is all we need to notice. This phenomenon itself is something we can objectively know with reasonably high confidence, as it&#039;s a fact about the brain that can now even be observed through neuroscience (fMRI). What you&#039;re failing to notice here, and what seemingly most intelligent people fail to notice (including myself for a very long time), is that we have all the moral ground we should ever need to reasonably claim. Here it is:<br /><br />1. Good/Correct: The absolute maximum amount of well-being for all conscious beings.<br />2. Bad/Wrong: The absolute maximum amount of suffering for all conscious beings.<br /><br />Sam Harris calls this the Moral Landscape[2], and the concept is powerful shit. Before allowing your mind to rail against this idea, allow me to say this: If morality isn&#039;t fundamentally concerned with the suffering/well-being of all conscious beings, then I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about. What&#039;s more, anyone who would claim this doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about either.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hitler was moral by his own standards, and I don&#039;t see anything anywhere that objectively proves my morals are better than his.&nbsp; Mine just say let everyone choose their own life, insofar as it doesn&#039;t inhibit another&#039;s right to choose the same.&nbsp; His told him differently.&nbsp; But his were just as &quot;good&quot; as mine -- in outcome obviously they&#039;re radically different, but putting that aside I mean: what exactly makes his somehow less true or good than my own other than human biology (which again seems to me by its very nature to be subjective)?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Would you play a simple thought experiment with me?

You mention &quot;radically different&quot; outcomes. The outcome is the point, and &quot;putting it aside&quot; is to remove all meaning from the question at hand. It&#039;s how we understand which ideas are better or worse than others.

To draw that conclusion is a failure of logic.<br /><br />Also, claiming objective morality is not the same as claiming that humans are capable of fully answering all moral questions. It seems clear that we cannot fully answer all moral questions, and perhaps we cannot even fully answer ANY moral questions. We can, however, reasonably and reliably distinguish which answers are better or worse than others. Answers to moral questions have consequences, and it is through these consequences that we can gain insight to their moral value.<br /><br />Notice I stay away from the term &quot;absolute morality&quot;. I do this because we tend to think of &quot;absolute&quot; as having attachment with &quot;singular&quot;, which just confuses the issue. We don&#039;t need to KNOW everything about objective morality to orient ourselves rightly toward it. All we need to do is to tap into our innate first principle: ideas that are more true are better than ideas that are less true.&nbsp; (again, finding and understanding truth at deeper levels is the hard work)<br /><br />If you seriously think we can&#039;t differentiate these things, then you&#039;ve utterly failed to notice the fruits of this value that are all around you. For example, the fact that we can even have this conversation in this way is a manifestation of the human capacity to discern what is real from what isn&#039;t combined with the human capacity to improve upon its innate capacities.<br /><br /><br />[a] On top of this, there may be 1000 more much better answers that we simply have not even articulated yet. And possibly&nbsp; 100 more even better answers than that, that we simply will never be able to formulate. None of this means that all answers are equal.

To draw that conclusion is a failure of logic.<br /><br />Also, claiming objective morality is not the same as claiming that humans are capable of fully answering all moral questions. It seems clear that we cannot fully answer all moral questions, and perhaps we cannot even fully answer ANY moral questions. We can, however, reasonably and reliably distinguish which answers are better or worse than others. Answers to moral questions have consequences, and it is through these consequences that we can gain insight to their moral value.<br /><br />Notice I stay away from the term &quot;absolute morality&quot;. I do this because we tend to think of &quot;absolute&quot; as having attachment with &quot;singular&quot;, which just confuses the issue. We don&#039;t need to KNOW everything about objective morality to orient ourselves rightly toward it. All we need to do is to tap into our innate first principle: ideas that are more true are better than ideas that are less true.&nbsp; (again, finding and understanding truth at deeper levels is the hard work)<br /><br />If you seriously think we can&#039;t differentiate these things, then you&#039;ve utterly failed to notice the fruits of this value that are all around you. For example, the fact that we can even have this conversation in this way is a manifestation of the human capacity to discern what is real from what isn&#039;t combined with the human capacity to improve upon its innate capacities.<br /><br /><br />[a] On top of this, there may be 1000 more much better answers that we simply have not even articulated yet.

It is evident that although we are capable of rational thought (hence our aptitude for science) when we make decisions we appear to have evolved to make these from an emotional not a rational standpoint.

The moral in in itself doesn&#039;t mean shit inside of us but when it&#039;s acted upon and manifests in the real world then we can judge the validity or the &#039;rightness&#039; of your so called moral.

This is the actual paradox of the whole subject. How do you convince someone what their doing is wrong and immoral when in their belief they are acting in accordance with their inner compass of morality. Now you add a distorted hierarchy of morals, extreme violence, poverty, and oppression to the mix and what set of morals would come of that? <br /><br />I&#039;m not disagreeing with you at all. I agree with you mo pretty much all your points but I think we were just trying to arrive to two different points. Another example in the Western world one of our morals is that most of us general put a high value on human life. In places like the Middle East and Africa that just isn&#039;t so. Kids are desensitized at such a young age by seeing dead bodies on the street or having their family murdered. Now what kind of morals will that kid have growing up?<br /><br />&nbsp;To be honest it&#039;s kinda hard to predicate that but I think it&#039;s safe to say the morals of that child will exponentially different than the morals of a child growing up in the West where for the most part it&#039;s pretty safe and comfortable lifestyle. Now if said child in the West was living in poverty then the comparison would be a bit more similar and they might have some similiarities but then again taking into account the religious differences if applicable, life experiences, the rationality of the person, and their willingness to have their basic human needs supplied we will still ultimately come to two different sets of moral values.<br /><br />So the question remains if one religions moral teaches their people that anyone that has a different belief then themselves that they are second class citzens and deserved to be persecuted and punished to the ends of the earth.&nbsp; That logic is about as flawed as the concept of turning Iraq into a Democratic state. I can pretty much conclude that was a failed experiment. I&#039;ll leave with this peaceful verse from the Quran to prove my point:<br /><br />Quran (3:151) - &quot;Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority&quot;.<br /><br />Quran (8:12) - &quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&quot;<br /><br />Quran (8:39) - &quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion should be only for Allah&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Quran (9:5) - &quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&quot; <br /><br />The last verse is especially important cause it proves my point of what I was saying earlier.

If/When it comes to you, I don&#039;t know how it would present itself, it is definitely a set of tests, and adapts accordingly. It&#039;s neat.<br /><br />Now as to my &quot;answers&quot;, I believe it was a reward by virtue of questioning. Long story short, I asked if the godless need a god. Water as the essence of life, revealed the Earth as the only safety net we have. Yikes, right? It gets better if you let it. We&#039;re globalized now, like it or not. All religions are ours to learn now. We can see through them, with science and logic - from polarity springs neutrality! Hint - The sword wasn&#039;t the answer. And the meaning of life is too profound for me to spoil for you, sorry.<br /><br />My research on the Quran is quite limited, plucked from the internet&#039;s garden. The next verse is very much appreciated. As a westerner my perspective of Muslims has been at least slightly tainted throughout the years, you know what propaganda can do :( Our paths may be different, but it doesn&#039;t mean either are unjust! And I&#039;m really not picking on Islam, just thirsting for knowledge. I&#039;ll leave the Quran alone for now :)Older fish to fry...<br /><br />Revelations - Do you know who, or how many wrote those? I don&#039;t trust them. It&#039;s much deeper than that. Does history belongs to those who kept and twisted it for their own gain? Not all of it, mix sources and keep digging. Keep asking. History repeats and repeats in an odd fashion, especially in the cradles of civilization. Would Rome be rewarded for their greed with a blueprint of the master plan? Ha.

I was raised in a pentecostal christian family and attended a christian private high school from K-12, I never truly considered myself a christian, and after a long and deep journey of mind and spirit, I finally have come to my current belief structure. I currently profess myself as agnostic, much to the chagrin of my atheist friends.

Allow me to reiterate: Islam is a specific religion that claims a specific personality for god, claims divine responsibility for a specific series of events, claims divine responsibility for specific natural phenomena, claims exclusive domain over all knowledge of the nature of truth. The claims of Islam are just poorly suited to the facts of reality, and because of this we can know that the god personality of Islam is no god at all. As long as humans attach innately human conceptions (e.g. personality/ego) to universal truth, they will be unable to realize the potential of what humanity *can* know.<br />

				I think the question &#039;Is there a higher intelligence&#039; is philosophical masturbation (not taking anything away from it, btw). We may never know and science has proven that nature chugs perfectly &amp; predictably well without interference from a divine source. However, the likelihood that there is a God in the image created by Abrahamic religions (mostly Judaism, Christianity, Islam) is the most stupid idea ever conceived by man. <br /><br />God did not build us in his own image, rather man made god in his own.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				There is no proof for god, thus god is in same field as unicorns, elves, satan etc...<br /><br />But the concept of karma and rebirth have more scientific proof compared to others. Like people recalling they died in a fatal gunwound and they having birthmarks and brain damage by the spot they were shot thru in the head.when u do good to others, they do good back to you, i would guess its from our hunter and gatherer society&#039;s gene.

				Religion can be a beautiful gift to give someone.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great form a population control, a great way to meet people with similar interests, and a great way to pass the time.&nbsp; The internet is also all of these things and I must admit to being a devout internet worshiper. <br /><br />As someone who was raised by people who had no religion whatsoever and mostly shunned others that did, I am not religious in any way but sometimes I do wish I was.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the day people like to create groups to exclude people and separate themselves from other experiences and ideas, life is easier with a closed mind. <br /><br />Does being the last sane person on earth make me crazy?

				For all those people that is deny the existent of God the Creator. I ask you a question do you need a torch to see the sun? No of course not. Because His existence if obvious. There is a book that is called the Torch I suggest seeking it out. <br /><br />Well for I those that do believe that a supreme being exist He must be all Powerful. And those that say why cannot He stop evil. Well you have free will right. All people have free will and you cherish it. So if some people out of there free will do evil is this Gods fault? This life is a test, this life is not paradise if this would be paradise no bad thing would happen. Would you agree?<br />And those that claim the religion are made up by man. Well go study some religion. Some religions/ideologies are made by man or where alter.<br />And religions ascribing character and personalty to God. For those that believe that there is some one they cannot see how would you know how that some one is like? Well maybe it is so that, that some one want to inform you about himself? So he sends you a letter with an description how he is like. Maybe he is wiser and more knowledgeable then you. So in that letter he also include so advice some guidance.<br />So if you have not seen God you can never deny his attributes. <br />And that God is the universe that?&nbsp; The universe began with a big bang so it has a begin therefore is must have an end. This is pure and simple logic. God the Creator is Ever - Lasting. The universe is not.

				@jundullahi<br /><br />As you explain it, your god &quot;Allah&quot; sounds no different in nature than what I mean when I say &quot;universe&quot; or &quot;cosmos&quot;. Until you bring in words written by men about what &quot;Allah&quot; desires (i.e. the Quran). The cosmos does not desire, it simply exists. Conscious beings inside the cosmos do experience desire, but desire does not define the cosmos in any deep way. I know that your Allah does not exist because he simply cannot exist. <br /><br />Your culture is beautiful, and the products of its desire to know the cosmos (e.g. the Quran) are beautiful. Unfortunately they are also painfully ugly and uselessly violent because not only are they are incomplete (as all communicable human knowledge simply must be), but they are demonstrably inferior to the greater collection of understanding we already have.<br /><br />I hope you know that I do not discount the poetry, philosophical insights, and life-affirming parts of your belief system. I love them, I am thankful for them, I wish to know more about them, and I adopt them when I find them to be the very best method to conceptually understanding ourselves and the cosmos. I simply discard the rest, because I can and do know that it is no longer useful. Imagine what we could achieve as a species if we could all (or really just MOSTLY) come together and do the same.

				The reptillian race that enslaves our planet are fucking snakes, if you dont believe me try to explain George Bush Jr.&#039;s pupils in his main picture on wikipedia right now, oh yes and there is no way it could have been altered, because the pic was sourced straight from the department of defense. There are aliens, and they are closer than you think. And, abitpeckish, Sorry if I seem to have a horribly negative viewpoint, but just look at the Earth, how are we going to un-saturate the entire ocean of the thousands of tons of plastic that is just melted into sun baked synthetic gel, mixed in with our ocean water. Entire species are dying in huge droves. Something big is happening, and I am sorry to inform you that it is not going in a good direction. We have fucking scientists inventing ways to form a nuclear blast into a concentrated beam. Korea is testing nukes high up in the atmosphere which could DESTROY a countries ENTIRE ELECTRIC GRID. Lol I am sorry to say, but with the most amount of positive energy in the world, we are not going to turn our world around. Human beings are the root of all evil on the Earth, well as most would see it. I personally think the true root of all evil is the &quot;reptilians&quot; although I hate calling them that because at this point it is more than just a theory to me. Lol I am honestly trying to be as positive as possible, but when you fucking pull a peice of skin off your lip and examine it under a microscope to find that your skin cells are crawling with multicolored &quot;life-like&quot; nano fibers, that MELT LIKE FUCKING PLASTIC when you burn them, and show up in lab tests as being made out of silicone plastics, you start to worry about shit. Lol at this point I am truely only concerned about my own health, lol in my eyes humanity is fucked. I will hope and hope as much as I can for a solution, But if true yin/yan blance exists in this world, which I believe does, there is no way the universe will continue to let us live on this Earth. Lol, just think about it, we are directly injecting our Mother Earth with MEGATONS of poison pretty much on a DAILY BASIS. Everything is made out of plastics now too. Did you know many of the Eskimo tribes living in Alaska are having major fertility problems because the main part of their diet is seal, and the seals are literally full of plastic, from eating all the fish who had plastic in them. Did you know it is scientifically proven that newborn babies come out of the womb PRE-POLLUTED with hundreds of toxic chemicals? How do we even begin to turn this around? And why is no one trying harder? One of the biggest fucking problems is most people dont even give a fuck anymore and are more worried about their stupid little personal problems. Lol sorry for the rant, I seriously just want an organic farm somewhere I can literally escape the system. Oh yes and I just love how we are using airplanes to spray megatons of aluminum metal particles into our atmosphere to &quot;reflect the suns rays back&quot; while it clearly has not helped the warming of our globe 1 percent, yet they continue to do it year, after year after year. If there was not a darker agenda at play, I feel we would be doing much different things than we are now. People have barely even begun to realize the damn problems, let alone deal with them. But I am vouging for the human race, so heres to us all, THE 99% We could make a difference if we all woke up...

				Nah I just smoke weed, and trip a few times a year, and like I said I do not like calling them that, that is just how they are know to the majority of the population. And most people who believe in such things are quickly dismissed as crazy or something in a matter of seconds, without even a second guess in judgement. Pretend you are not from Earth at all, you are not even a human, and think of it this way. IF, there was an advanced race of Aliens that wanted a slave race on Earth, and they had the technology to &quot;blend in&quot; with humans, Think of how easy It would be for them to unnoticably infiltrate our planet, Pull up strings on all the major points of power in the world, Use their advanced technology to alter history in great ways, such as &quot;Jesus&quot; and &quot;Mohammad&quot; (Explaining the &quot;miracles&quot; they were able to do) And basically they would harvest everything of worth on our planet like taking candy from a baby. I think its funny how most alien movies show an alien race that is only a few hundred years ahead of us, where as in reality, If another race could make it too our Earth from another solar system (even another planet in our own) They would literally have to be hundreds of thousands of years ahead of us. And lets not forget, the more technology we are able to create, the faster it evolves, in a n exponential fashion.

				Dude, I looked at the picture of Bush Jr. and I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about, besides, if a reptilian alien race was able to look exactly like humans why would they mess up something so much a part of the human experience, the eyes?&nbsp; I mean if Bush really was an alien why wouldn&#039;t he just wear colored contacts to look like real eyes?&nbsp; I know that you are probably dismissed quiet quickly but you have to understand that your claims seem very outlandish.

				It kinda pisses me off that some people have to take such a preachy and oppositional approach to religion. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s just because I&#039;ve been lucky enough to grow up in a fairly secular society, and even though I went to a religious school we were never forced to believe in something that we didn&#039;t need to.<br /><br />It just annoys me so much when you get so many arrogant atheists who think they&#039;re better just because they have a different opinion.

				Did you blow it up full size? Because his pupils are not fucking circles, they have flat edges almost like upsidedown triangles. And his eyes have been blue and brown in some pictures, google george bush jr. brown eyse sure you&#039;ll find something. But if you zoom in enough where literally only his eyes are on your screen you will see clear as day. And that is not picture quality problme it is fucking High Resolution. Anyways, they do do their best to hide their true forms, If you were a completely alien race do you know how hard it would be to blend in?? Anyways I am sure most of the people on the news and other various television viewings where I notice the whack eyes and crazy things going on in peoples faces. I think they may be like hybrids or something and are under some sort of mind control but I am not sure. And yes pretty much most of this stuf sounds like it is straight out of a fucking science fiction novel, thats what scares me...<br /><br />And I am with you wildrepublic, as I am not really trying to preach anyting, but I wish for people to see the things that are right in front of them, no one can look at George Bush&#039;s pupils in that picture and tell me they are human. Lol I know everyone&#039;s just gonna say I&#039;m crazy cause thats how the &quot;mindcontrol&quot; works, which you all will think that sounds soooo fucking crazy whacked out too. But trust me it is ok if you dont believe me lol, I hardly want to believe myself, but If I could open just 1 person&#039;s eyes to this shit, then I would have accomplished something

				I&#039;m of the opinion that until a person passes away, they won&#039;t know for sure if there is in fact a God. Yes, I do believe there is a God but I won&#039;t know for sure until the day I die. I certainly won&#039;t be wasting my precious time speculating on what is in store for me once I pass away. I will however hold onto the thought that there is something there, some sort of a spiritual after life, but have no perception on what it actually is. I certainly don&#039;t believe that the Bible is completely accurate. In over 2000 years, the stories have undoubtedly changed (Chinese Whispers). The problem with Religion, IMO, is it&#039;s all based on a belief, a faith if you like. You only have to look at Christianity and the many different Denominations that have evolved from it. From Catholic to Anglican and the many in between, all are based around Christianity yet each one has different beliefs which are really based on one&#039;s perception of past events occurring 2000+ years ago. A lot has changed since then and if those same events were to happen today, people would more than likely form a different perspective again.<br />Everyone is entitled to their view but until each of us are dead, none of us can provide a definitive and factual answer. Even when we die, that information will never be passed on for obvious reasons. Believe what you like but enjoy life as we know it and when the time comes one day down the line to exit this wonderful place, we can move on to what ever comes next.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Check out carnicominstitute.org, they are the only real organization doing any research in this, I only know what I can see in my microscope, but their latest research with their infrared spectrophotometer is pretty interesting, lol although you will probably go to the site and say you dont understand or something, because there is TONS of info there, this last report was from May 16, so it is pretty interesting. And for your info they have run the nano fibers in question through one of those machines the FBI uses to identify different kinds of fibers and their specific manufacturers at crime scenes, and there was no match at all, hmm that is interesting, they catalog EVERY KNOWN SYNTHETIC FIBER, yet these nano filiments do not match anything ever made by any country. Although I do not expect many of you to fully comprehend the information provided, It is worth checking out. It does feel like shit to know about this stuff though, and barely have a clue as to how to fix it. But this is my reality whether it is yours or not, EVERYONE has the fibers in them, so it effects us all.

Those kinds of atheists either don&#039;t know or are ignoring the fact that all human beings are hardwired to believe everything we are told.<br /><br />It has been scientifically shown by neuroscientists like Sam Harris amongst others that we instantly believe everything that we hear. Then we go through a process where we critically evaluate and may decide to disbelieve. However we only have a sort window of opportunity to do this and if we are distracted before we can disbelieve the belief becomes entrenched in our brains and becomes harder to disbelieve.<br /><br />Basically the longer we hold on to a belief the harder it is for the brain to let it go. Atheists brains are hardwired the same as everybody else so there no need for any of us to feel superior to believers. It&#039;s not a matter of reason or intelligence it&#039;s a question of biology.

To our knowledge, this is the first study applied to this filament form collected under uniform and defined conditions.&nbsp; At this time, our research is conditional upon available resources and equipment.&nbsp; Our current capabilities include visual and microscopic analysis and comparison, qualitative chemical testing, and limited spectroscopic analysis. <br /><br />The Institute desires to complete a thorough scientific analysis of this material, including chemical and biological composition in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, these tests will require additional sophisticated equipment, methods, resources, supplies, and trained personnel at cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />Samples used in this research are to be provided by the general public, so your participation in this project is vital.&nbsp; Protocols and procedures for the collection of samples are described in detail.&nbsp; (see PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE COLLECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILAMENT SAMPLES).&nbsp; Data compiled from this research will be available to the public on our web site. <br /><br />This project is dependent upon public funding for its conduct and completion. The success and future progress of this endeavor are completely dependent upon your involvement and donations.&nbsp; Currently, our limited resources prevent us from reporting the specific analysis of any one sample.&nbsp; This is a very important study that affects all of us.&nbsp; To contribute financially to support this project and to broaden our capability to serve the public, please make a donation at carnicominstitute.org.&nbsp; Thank you. <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />I could post more tidbits of info,&nbsp; but I would much rather people investigate for themselves if they want.

				Fuck religion! Meditate and discover things for yourself as an individual, that is the true way =) And if you feel compelled, read ALL the religious books and observe the meanings within them completely objectively, compare them. Interpret these religious artifacts as a scholar, not a dedicated follower, although most religions have been bent way out of proportion in past couple of thousands of years, there are things that can be learned from each one. Create your own spiritual path, devoted to humanity and nature, and I can almost guarantee you will not go wrong =)

				I just don&#039;t understand any longer how people can wake up everyday and doubt that there is something holding this entire universe together.&nbsp; This is the problem with the world today.&nbsp; People believe they are so smart and intellectual.&nbsp; No matter how smart you think you are, guess what, someone/thing is smarter.&nbsp; Mankind needs to humble their arrogant ways and start being thankful for such an incredible blessing that we all call Life.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t get me wrong, this is not an angry rant.&nbsp; I think its just fine to raise questions about God, because he gave us that ability.&nbsp; He created us in his own image and gave us the same powers of logic that he has.&nbsp; God wants you to ask questions, how else will you learn and eventually find him as the answer to all those questions.&nbsp; God is not something you find in the heavens.&nbsp; God is right in front of your eyes.&nbsp; He is your eyes.&nbsp; He is your ups, and your downs, your faith and your doubt. God is you, and you are God.&nbsp; Two things at the same time you say?&nbsp; yes absolutely, and further than that, all things are God, and God is all things.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />God bless you all in finding the truth, cause apparently you are at your fill with doubt!

				yeah I have to agree, I most religious people have never seen death. that&#039;s why they&#039;re still religious. fair enough being religious after the death of a loved one for a short while but that&#039;s just the denial phase. it&#039;s a nice thought having your loved ones waiting for you but that wears off when you realise you&#039;re having traumatic flash backs of them dying a slow, but horrible death. I&#039;m new to atheism and I find I&#039;m much more tolerant of everything. I used to be racist when I didn&#039;t even realise I was. I feel liberated. <br />I have no idea why I was even a Christian when I was a feminist and a believer in marriage equality. I told myself so many lies to make up for the hatred in that bloody book! <br /><br /><br />everyone should just listen to the wise lyrics of Tim Minchin Lol xx

				Personally I think the only form of religion you could even begin to argue for is deism, and you cannot even bridge the gap between the start of the universe and that creator(s) yet.
