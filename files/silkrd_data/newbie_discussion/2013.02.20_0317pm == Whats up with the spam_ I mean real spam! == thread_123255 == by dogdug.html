				Guys, I, personally, am here deleting spam for 18+ hours a day.&nbsp; All day yesterday, included, but eventually I have to sleep.&nbsp; I&#039;m back on and cleaning it up, but some patience and understanding would be nice.

				It&#039;s okay ... I know sometimes people don&#039;t realize that there are literally two of us doing this&nbsp; - we&#039;re both on almost all day every day and the spam does come in throughout the day/night .... we are usually here to delete it, but no one can be here 24/7, so sometimes the spammers do hit again while we&#039;re offline.&nbsp; We always clean it up as quickly as we get back on!&nbsp; :)

				If you hadn&#039;t put that stupid 50 posts rule I bet there wouldn&#039;t have been so much spam. Just my 2 cents.
