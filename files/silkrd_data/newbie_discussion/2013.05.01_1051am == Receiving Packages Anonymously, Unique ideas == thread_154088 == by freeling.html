				Hello fello SR noobs<br /><br />Over the past few days of SR being down i have been doing some brain storming on where i can get mail sent anonymously rather than to my home address. After all nobody wants customs to come to their house and end their silk road adventure before they have even received their first order.<br /><br />So I have come up with some creative ways/places to receive mail. I will list them in order of least creative to most creative.<br /><br />1) Ask a friend if you can get mail sent to his address under a fake name (this is a really lame idea but i figure it is an option)<br /><br />2) Get it sent to a random address and try to beat the actual owner to your package, its not that difficult if you know when the mail man comes, units/apartments work better than houses because generally there are a whole bunch of letter boxes all together and it doesn&#039;t look so suss.<br /><br />3) Go online and look for properties that are for sale/rent in your area, best to try and find places that are empty, you can generally tell by the pics. Once you have found a suitable place online, go and check it out in person, if its empty have a look in the letter box, generally there will be some mail in there (if not probably not the best place as mail is obviously being checked by someone or diverted).If there is mail then you have 2 choices, you can either use the name and address of the previous owners/ tenants&nbsp; to get mail sent or you can use a fake one. Its always a good idea to send a test letter to any random address to make sure they don&#039;t have mail diversion in place. You can also send mail to Holiday homes, this works well because you can find out there availability online.<br /><br />4) You can get mail sent to the post office, and use a fake ID (from SR) to pick it up, if your not sure of how to do this then just call your local post office and them them you need to receive some mail but don&#039;t have an address to send it to (because your a foreigner traveling around in a kombi? be creative) they will explain it.<br /><br />5) This is an awesome one for if you need someone to sign for your goods or for larger orders as it takes abit more planning and you can really only use it once. <br />Go online a have a look for hostels/hotels in your area, hostelworld is a good place to start. Choose a hostel/hotel, the bigger the better because the people working there have less idea of who&#039;s stayed there, YHA for example, either call them or go in and tell them something similar to this &quot;hi i lost my passport when i was staying here a few weeks ago and am expecting my new one to arrive soon, i just wondering if it has arrived yet? (no) That&#039;s Ok ill come back in a few weeks.&nbsp; Then send whatever you want and pick it up n a few weeks. The Key point is that 99% of the time large hostels and Hotels will accept mail made out to anyone even if its not a current guest. I know this for a fact. But to be on the safe side its best to let them know you are expecting something that way they will tell you if its not going to arrive before you send it.<br /><br />You can also do other things like opening a PO Box with a fake name, but that gets a bit hectic with payments etc. <br /><br />So that&#039;s just some of my ideas they may not be perfect but i thought i would share them anyway, if anyone has any other unique ones I&#039;d love to hear about them.<br />wooohooo SR is back up :):)

				All of these sound like really bad options that are inviting trouble.<br /><br />The fake id/open a private mailbox at one of those UPSstore-like places seems like the least bad.

				These ideas, all seem like more effott than its worth. Perhaps if you were only ever going to get one thing of SR then perhaps use the hostel idea. But If it is going to be a semi regular thing then just use your home address. The chances of customs intercepting you mail are slim. If you are worried about that perhaps just start with domestic mail. And easy to package things like LSD. PM some vendors and ask them if they use MBB Bags. If they do then there is not much to worry about. Save yourself a lot of time and effot that way.<br /><br />Clockwork

				It&#039;s nice to see a newbie thinking for itself, so thanks OP! :)<br /><br />Some ideas that weren&#039;t mentioned already:<br /><br />-&gt; For a student in dorms or somebody living in an apartment complex:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9615.msg90078#msg90078<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ohai fellow criminal masterminds!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I have a great solution for certain types of buyers, or buyers in the appropriate locations.<br /><br />Where I live, there exists student accommodation in the locale.<br /><br />In this student accommodation a pigeon hole system is used for post.<br /><br />That is:<br /><br />You walk into a part of their building, and they have a series of pigeon holes with letters placed in them by the First Initial of their Surname or something very similar.<br /><br />This is extremely common in flat block complexes and university student accommodation.<br /><br />This only works for regular letters and magazine sized shrink wraps. But most deliveries are likely to be letter sized for buyers anyhow.<br /><br />So, simply address your letter to a relatively normal sounding name at a specific apartment/room number e.g. Susan Kahneman and wait.<br /><br />For some types of accommodation you&#039;ll need a small key, but getting that and making a copy isn&#039;t exactly a feat for James Bond.<br /><br />You have:<br /><br />&nbsp; :) Plausible deniablity.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) The possibility of frequently checking the pigeon hole unobtrusively.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) Controlled delivery is next to impossible when flocks of students back for lunch are investigating their pigeon holes.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) You can check the schema for addressing. e.g. Check that a certain Apartment No. or Block No. or Room No. actually exists.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) You can ensure somebody really lives at that Apartment/Block/Room, and then ensure your name you address to is different.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) Same Name/Same Location is pretty much next to zero probability.<br /><br />&nbsp; :) The sheer volume of mail makes it unlikely the Flat Block Complex / Student Accommodation staff are going to suspicious of your packet.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Quote from: brockeh on January 25, 2012, 09:11 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; maybe im not understanding 100% but it seems like there is a reasonable chance that whoevers living there will grab everything in their hole/box thing and either bin, open or mark return to sender your gear =O<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, that&#039;s next to impossible.<br /><br />You see, the pigeon holes aren&#039;t for specific apartments or dorm rooms. That&#039;s the central principal at work here. It&#039;s inefficient for each renter/student to have their own personal pigeon hole. So, all envelopes (usually not packages, those you have to sign for usually, which is not a good idea) wind up in pigeon holes according to some kind of internal addressing system. 90% of the time this is sorted by surname.<br /><br />Example: All letters for &#039;James Anderson&#039;, &#039;Luke Allen&#039;, &#039;Mark Adams&#039;, &#039;Philip Alexander&#039; etc go into the pigeon hole for &#039;A&#039;.<br /><br />Now, anybody can walk up to a pigeon hole and check whether mail has arrived for them. That&#039;s what makes controlled delivery improbable.<br /><br />You just need to flip through a collection of letters in a pigeon hole to check that there is no name similar to the one you&#039;re going to be using in case of an accidental pickup. For surety, you should also ensure that the room/dorm/apartment no. you&#039;re addressing to, actually has a tenant (in case the post is held back by the staff, albeit that is unlikely for large blocks of flats or dorms).<br /><br />Lastly; the majority of such places don&#039;t ID at the door to check that you&#039;re a student/renter at that location block of flats/apartments/dorms. The sheer volume of people makes it impracticable because people are always crowding through doorways, holding doors open for each other etc.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t suggest you use student accommodation if you&#039;re above &gt; 30 years old, you might be the odd one out. Similarly with &lt; 30 for blocks of flats. Of course if you look sufficiently mature/young, it won&#039;t matter so much.<br /><br />Another reason why this plan is sheer awesomesauce, is that these places where mail is collected by students, are usually open 24/7. Students are creatures of the night and renters are frequently at day jobs so it&#039;s frequently only practicable for them to pick up their post in the late evening/night/early morning.<br /><br />Loopholes! Loopholes everywhere!&nbsp; :D<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-&gt; Using virtual offices as a mail collection points for bulk orders:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11770.msg110592#msg110592<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I believe it&#039;s a good idea to have a virtual office mail holding service registered to a business name, yes.<br /><br />There is no ID required, virtual offices are like weeds, they are everywhere, whereas P.O boxes are under the wing of a federal institution with a central database.<br /><br />It really depends on what you&#039;re doing. If you&#039;re getting some weed occasionally, hell, use your own address and name, it&#039;s fine.<br /><br />If however you are in business, you want superior anonymity due to the volume you&#039;re getting of goods, whether legal or illegal.<br />Also, virtual offices make it easy to setup lots and lots of mail holding geographical locations for different purposes. Private mailboxes do the same thing.<br /><br />If you fall in between, you have middling volume of e.g. weed, that you maybe distribute to friends etc, then I think the business P.O Box is ok, but I still prefer a virtual office.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just to note that even when virtual offices are more expensive than P.O boxes, they still generally offer much higher levels of anonymity. For example, unlike a P.O box, virtual offices frequently come with extra services like the ability to check whether mail has arrived, ability to re-mail post online and lots of other options. Somebody told me a while back of a virtual office that will even photograph your mail and email you photos of it :)<br /><br />These options change dramatically from place to place, because virtual offices don&#039;t have a standard template of services, but this is an advantage! <br /><br />-&gt; Sending post to a homeless shelter as a dead drop.<br /><br />This may seem unusual and I haven&#039;t used this method myself but many times the homeless shelter organizations have free mail collection services for homeless people. There is usually a couple of standard addresses in a city where mail arrives for them. Anybody can send mail to these, and anybody can pick them up since it&#039;s unusual for the homeless to have proof of identity. Used correctly this could be enormously useful. However you should profile the people who go there so you don&#039;t stick out, or potentially use a courier.<br /><br />-&gt; If you don&#039;t live in a city, you may feel somewhat disadvantaged with most of Pine&#039;s examples. But fear not! Because in the countryside there is the greatest (awesomerst!) mail collection facility of them all. It is simple but elegant. In the countryside most people have mailboxes at the end of their roads. Often you shall see a dozen mailboxes at a junction in the countryside, and often these aren&#039;t so much as locked. However don&#039;t get any smart ideas, sending mail to one of these surreptitiously in somebodies name would be very stupid. People who live in the country avail of a counter intelligence gathering procedure that would make the CIA blush. It is perfectly normal to have a neighbor call another neighbor saying there&#039;s a car on the way up the road to visit you, so check it out, and that&#039;s from 20km away. An intelligence analyst would need satellite targeting to get the same abilities haha!<br /><br />So what you do is you *buy a secondhand mailbox*. Then you stick it with the other mailboxes to keep it company, at one of those locations where they apparently gather like accumulated flotsam on the seashore. Done! When compared to the other techniques, country dwellers have it easy. Often people in the country will travel 5km or more down the road to &quot;pick up the mail&quot;, so there&#039;s no need to explain that you live nearby if somebody appears to collect mail when you do. These locations are the equivalent of informal mail drops* or office water coolers. <br /><br />* Pine&#039;s theory is that much like the way buildings in a real time strategy game evolve into more advanced versions of themselves over time, that these locations ultimately evolve into post offices! I have no evidence for this, but it seems compelling, like ideas about abiogenesis in the middle ages. I also think the more likely people are to wear cowboy hats or furry hats in your state, the more likely this is to work. Think about it.<br /><br />

				I work for the post service in my country, so it was fairly easy for me. I hung up a mailbox near a building where all the apartments have the same address, and then I registered the mailbox when I was on my route. As far as the post company knows, there is a person with my chosen name living in that building. When I order something from SR, I fetch it before it even reaches the mailbox.<br /><br />That might work for you people too. Pick a building with multiple apartments, hang up a mailbox and write a name on it. It would be best if there are mailboxes belonging to other addresses there too. I didn&#039;t write the address on the mailbox because that could cause suspicion by the people actually living there. The postman will take the letter to that address and look for a mailbox with that name on it anyway. You should of course try it out by ordering free stuff from the web first, like a travel magazine or something.

				maybe i&#039;m dumb as fuck but i have had every single SR order ive ever made come directly to my house. and im talking about weed and considerable amounts of heroin. never have had a problem. (although now watch me jinx it) but people get packages everyday for so many legitimate reasons and these vendors really know wtf they&#039;re doing when it comes to stealth. maybe im just &quot;dumb&quot; but i&#039;m not trying to fuck around with finding some fake address or abandoned house and shit. id rather my shit come straight to my door. then again i live in a small small town where im sure the last thing on their mind is that im having drugs sent to me haha. But i sure blow peoples minds when i show them medical herb from cali in south dakota hahaha. and shit here its like h doesnt exist. I moved here from milwaukee for god knows what reason with a 200$ a day heroin habit, what a bad idea. i guess the point was to get away from my dealers and quit. and while ive cut down considerably, i could actually argue i pay more for h with these retarded prices on SR then i did back home with a daily habit. but thats off topic. this post was probably pointless in helping anyone lol. but bottom line just get the shit sent to your house as long as your not worried about your family/friends/girl/boyfriend finding your shit. i dont have to worry about that as im the only person who gets my mail. so fuck it, just my 2 cents.....

				Getting a burner would add an extra layer to security in any method that you won&#039;t know the delivery date. Give them the number and leave it somewhere public and inconspicuous, check it every few days. Plus I&#039;m sure if you get a prepaid app capable phone you could get or make an app to email your tor mail when it receives a call since only one number would be calling you. If the package is tracked you don&#039;t have to stick your neck out to get it unless the LEA knew they were supposed to call you. Tell them you&#039;re busy and to call if you haven&#039;t checked in a week after package has been delivered. You can buy burners on SR. Additionally I&#039;d buy a fake ID from SR as well to set up a PO box. Create as complete a fake person as possible. Even give it the physical address of someone you hate so if LEA raided them you could have a good chuckle.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154088.msg1084171#msg1084171">Quote from: MadScyentist on May 03, 2013, 03:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154088.msg1073860#msg1073860">Quote from: trainsTrainsTRAINS on May 01, 2013, 11:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">All of these sound like really bad options that are inviting trouble.<br /><br />The fake id/open a private mailbox at one of those UPSstore-like places seems like the least bad.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Best but also the worst option.&nbsp; If OP gets pegged with a fake ID, that&#039;s a pretty big federal offense!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope you realize shipping drugs through the mail is already a felony and they&#039;d wait to build as many charges as possible for your bust. No harm adding something small like that when you&#039;d already have three strikes. EDIT: Also using an alias is acceptable for everything EXCEPT tax evasion. Having a fake ID card may be illegal but using a fake name isn&#039;t. You aren&#039;t legally required to show or carry proof of ID in any situation including when the police stop you on the street and during arrests(although the police will find out anyway if they arrest you). Really it&#039;s just companies who take it up the ass from the man, for increased profit of course, that make you show ID.

				I dunno all of these seem like a waste of time or actually providing you less protection.&nbsp; If you get it sent to your house with your name, first off only the dealer knows your name and would not be in his best interest to give that up because you are giving him money.&nbsp; Second, if a package comes and you have to sign just say no because you weren&#039;t expecting it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Beating a guy to his mailbox?&nbsp; That&#039;s stealing mail and probably a felony, the hotel idea seems good on paper but just not worth the effort because I&#039;d say more than half the time you won&#039;t see that package, providing false ID, and you&#039;re putting your trust in some random hotel clerk.&nbsp; If something is sent to you in a discrete box, your mailman knows you live there, he&#039;ll have no idea and people buy online stuff all the time.&nbsp; Really no other good way than sending it to yourself or a friend who is foolish enough to take the risk.

				I gotta disagree with most of the replies here.&nbsp; Fake names, pseudo boxes (except the actual postman, thats great!!!), delivering to abandoned homes, old owners, anything but you real address, real name to me is a problem.<br /><br />If your package is intercepted by the cops in any of these situations, you cannot explain why you had the fake ID in the name of the drug package, why you were at the vacant home picking up drugs, your friend can easily rat you out, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />If it comes to your house, in your name, and you &quot;didn&#039;t order this or know what it was&quot; there is no crime.&nbsp; Anything else...and you have trouble denying its connected to you.<br /><br />The virtual office is decent, but you need to have lots of other legitimate packages going there, not just SR ones to be able to contend the &quot;bad&quot; package wasn&#039;t yours should the &quot;worst case&quot; happen.

Then you stick it with the other mailboxes to keep it company, at one of those locations where they apparently gather like accumulated flotsam on the seashore. Done! When compared to the other techniques, country dwellers have it easy. Often people in the country will travel 5km or more down the road to &quot;pick up the mail&quot;, so there&#039;s no need to explain that you live nearby if somebody appears to collect mail when you do. These locations are the equivalent of informal mail drops* or office water coolers. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This sounded great at first, but:?<br />The USPS seems to have a database of what addresses are real now. The mailman above &quot;registered&quot; the address of the box he added. That&#039;s sweet to be able to do of course. I wonder if it is necessary?<br />&nbsp;Also, I wonder if, at least in my area, adding a mailbox requires a legally habitable residential structure for that mailbox to be related to. Maybe a business address would not require that? I think the USPS database I mentioned above, also differentiates between residential and other addresses. I think if you add a box with a different Apt # (imaginary?) but the same address as the real apartments, it might work unless the Apt. staff noticed the box. The USPS database might even catch an incorrect apt #?<br />I think it might be very likely a postal delivery worker that does the same route every day would be quite likely to notice a new box (even if it were &quot;used&quot;) showing up on his route unless you can squeeze it into a group that all look a like (rural is not usually like that around here). Same with the other mailbox owners in the group noticing a new addressed box and wondering what new house is next to so and so&#039;s. I love Pine :-) and would be happy to have all my points trashed with stuff I should have realized :-)
