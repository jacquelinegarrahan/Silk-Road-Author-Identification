				High quality product!<br /><br />Grown under real sunlight, but under controlled conditions, so free of seeds, free of mould or insects.<br /><br />High in THC percentage. Snow-white of resin-crystals. This is our home-brand weed called Grandmothers Secret BIO, has PURE Skunk#1 and Afghani#1 parents, and is grown with love :-) No chemicals, just organic nutrients, properly cut and cured. Comes in a very discreet business parcel, tripple vaccuum sealed and with up-to-date stealth inside the package. Place of Origin: Spain<br /><br />Would love to keep every single bud, but I am in the need of money. Just waiting on my bitcoins to be transferred, than I will be in business. Will give you the best price, as this comes directly from the producer, no re-seller. No hidden additives, just PURE bio-hemp.<br /><br />How can police really try to achieve to close this site or do something against it, when it promotes fair trade for connoisseur hemp growers, without the risk of being contaminated on the distribution chain?<br /><br />Hope I can make alot of people very happy with this fine selection of ours! Any questions, don&#039;t hesitate to contact us!<br /><br />Best Regards &amp; Many wishes,<br />&quot;Grandmas Secret&quot; BIO Weed Farmers

				as soon as I have bitcoins, I will have a vendor account. Hope it will be today. I already paid for them. Can ship out from tomorrow on. Would appreciate some feedback or &quot;pre-orders&quot; to see if it is worth to spend the 4.8 bitcoin fee. Will look into that PGP stuff now...<br /><br />Greetz,<br />Grandma

				finally I have my bitcoins to pay the fee. But need to go out know.... Hope there will be some replies when I come back. Or more and more of the weed gets smokes by myself ;-)<br /><br />Very pleasant high - that beats almost everything what you&#039;ll find in a coffee-shop in the Netherlands. You&#039;ll love it! :-)<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: OpenPGP.js v.1.20130712<br />Comment: http://openpgpjs.org<br /><br />xo0EUgpNZAED/0gidUV6dh57iJoix4iHnzJ3+kkRN34DbR6M3sxid8bf+Sv+<br />u+qM68Lv9B+U0OdmJolie/hPn0eP+jjgejk/cU7ALthRaLKHscpLofub+lnn<br />sMnmXMjEhZvs+wTzSn8LqwmuKNpC7umahMOXO3CyOcOFrAc/0z5T9wrFzGL3<br />AxXrABEBAAHNPUdyYW5kbWEgPEJNLTJEQlNxUHYyY2dhNTY5WUJReGlONEdy<br />WU1uMUExTndrM01AYml0bWVzc2FnZS5jaD7CnAQQAQgAEAUCUgpNZQkQCeGx<br />sdlxR4sAAG9vA/wNmZexyXGTD/hH5yT65Um1VpBwabt+YNwIET0u9VFORZMT<br />WuAVjnraF/ueOMnt7sDdpKdqHlCAi+ebcVPnpJiOcYpiZdGLMmVFBw24/8k2<br />Vdu68IbfPFGRmNw2j/Z8+oSSuhyItvJ4WiUSVKWpnzPTEkk/kmZbIsuB+EUH<br />NLc7WQ==<br />=vl3I<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				keep an eye on that...<br /><br />Send parcels within EU, ships out the same day, tripple vaccuum sealed, super-stealth according to Silk Road recommendations. They won&#039;t catch it, you gonna get it. Take it, hold it, love it...<br /><br />So far, So good...

				well, I don&#039;t know yet.<br /><br />I am still figuring out what would be reasonable. Too low would offend other sellers, don&#039;t want to do dumping. Also quality should have it&#039;s price owing to comparatively high production costs. On the other hand, I need to be lower at the beginning to compensate the lack of positive feedback.<br /><br />What would you recommend? I had in mind 10 gramm packages for 1,3 Bitcoin each including freight &amp; package charges. Could offer smaller or bigger packages if required.

				Unfortunately I cannon make any comparisons know, because SilkRoad seems to be offline...<br /><br />Or is it just me who cannot enter?<br /><br />Will be off for a while and get in touch later, if there pop-up some questions. Thanks for visiting my topic, and I hope I can gain your interest and later probably promote to your satisfaction... :-)

				Please PM me for enquiries. Should I buy the seller account, will you order? Can only do so, if it get paid out directly, or do you think I would sell my weed otherwise. It belongs in the wine-cellar for being used at special occasions only ;-)<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: OpenPGP.js v.1.20130712<br />Comment: http://openpgpjs.org<br /><br />xo0EUgpNZAED/0gidUV6dh57iJoix4iHnzJ3+kkRN34DbR6M3sxid8bf+Sv+<br />u+qM68Lv9B+U0OdmJolie/hPn0eP+jjgejk/cU7ALthRaLKHscpLofub+lnn<br />sMnmXMjEhZvs+wTzSn8LqwmuKNpC7umahMOXO3CyOcOFrAc/0z5T9wrFzGL3<br />AxXrABEBAAHNPUdyYW5kbWEgPEJNLTJEQlNxUHYyY2dhNTY5WUJReGlONEdy<br />WU1uMUExTndrM01AYml0bWVzc2FnZS5jaD7CnAQQAQgAEAUCUgpNZQkQCeGx<br />sdlxR4sAAG9vA/wNmZexyXGTD/hH5yT65Um1VpBwabt+YNwIET0u9VFORZMT<br />WuAVjnraF/ueOMnt7sDdpKdqHlCAi+ebcVPnpJiOcYpiZdGLMmVFBw24/8k2<br />Vdu68IbfPFGRmNw2j/Z8+oSSuhyItvJ4WiUSVKWpnzPTEkk/kmZbIsuB+EUH<br />NLc7WQ==<br />=vl3I<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />

				do you mean Hash or Kush? Could make nice icolator hash from the trim.... Ice-O-Lator is up to 60% THC if made properly. Could sell that as well if there is interest. Or THC-Oil, up to 90% THC. Or Brownies ;-) for super stealth shipment, impossible to be detected, even via x-ray. Suggestions and price wishes are welcome... Ships from Spain or Netherlands.<br /><br />Many Thanks &amp; Best Wishes to this great community :-)
