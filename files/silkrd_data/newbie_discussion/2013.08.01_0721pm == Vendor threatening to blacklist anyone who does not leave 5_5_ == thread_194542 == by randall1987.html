				Is it okay for a vendor to say that if you do not leave a 5/5 rating they will:<br /><br />&quot;blacklist you on the private vendors blacklist and no vendor will sell to you&quot;<br /><br />How is the rating system worth anything at all if we have no choice but to leave 5/5 even if the vendor straight up lied to or stole from us?<br /><br />

				first off, there&#039;s no universal black listing system that all vendors use to communicate. furthermore, say the transaction did go sour and it got turned over to the resolution center, they&#039;re gonna weigh all the facts and rule in the favor of true justice. at the very worst, say this vendor is serious.. then placing a sub-par feedback score will prevent you from ordering from them again (assuming they remember your username, lol)

				IMO, raise hell about the vendor and their threats. I&#039;m personally curious who it might be. Every vendor i&#039;ve dealt with has been pleasant, but i also spend hours researching my products before i go through trying to get them :).<br /><br />Careful kids

				If that vendor is not ranked #1, tell them to go fuck themselves.<br />It&#039;s not worth it to deal with a vendor that is hostile.<br />Someone making demands of you after you pay them is utter bullshit.<br />In fact if after your order shows it&#039;s not up to par 100% give him a 1/5 and take the blacklisting.<br />You can explain to any vendor that isnt a dick the situation and if they cant understand then why give them your HARD EARNED MONEY...all they do is get paid for being in a drug network.<br /><br />Also you can blacklist vendors as well.<br />MHO<br />

				I, too, think the blackmail on the ratings is total bullshit. Wouldn&#039;t everyone benefit from an honest ratings system? I&#039;m still new to SR, with only 2 orders at about $275, but I&#039;ve looked around a lot (as I&#039;m sure everyone does) and it&#039;s pretty common to see that little message on the vendors&#039; pages. Seeing a 5/5 when the buyer got no product and no refund is a joke. Say a vendor screws up but the situation eventually gets it resolved, shouldn&#039;t they be able to leave a 4/5 for the hiccup but still be able to do business again? Ugh, that really grinds my gears.

				The only reason vendors threaten to blacklist you is because they have something to hide and usually that is they sell shit drugs or fake drugs hoping people are stupid and will not say anything.&nbsp; &nbsp; Vendors do not like it when you tell the truth and some will threaten you and when you think about it you have to be careful because they have your personal information and that can be dangerous.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two things i have realized here vendors to stay clear of and that is 1, if they threaten in the 5/5&nbsp; and 2 if they say they have pure drugs dont go near them because there full of shit scammers.

				I&#039;ve been a SR member since January, 2012. I&#039;ve spent about $3,800 on 51 transactions.<br /><br />Generally the best rule of thumb is to find reliable vendors and then stick with them.&nbsp; I generally am buying vicodins. There ARE good vendors, but they are always running out and/or raising prices. I find that the best prices are from brand new vendors--and that is where the risk comes in.<br /><br />I too am amazed at the good feedback some people give when the product never arrived, the seller would not communicate, and no refund or ship was offered. Still people say, not seller&#039;s fault 5/5; or USPS fucked up, 5/5; or seller seemed like a nice guy, 5/5.<br /><br />I suppose buyers are afraid of offending the sellers, but WTF? Don&#039;t be afraid to leave bad feedback! If you&#039;re wrong, you can always go back and change it.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t finalize early. If the 17 day auto-finalize deadline is approaching on an order that hasn&#039;t arrived, don&#039;t be afraid to hit the &quot;resolve&quot; link. The few times I&#039;ve been to SR resolution, SR management has been entirely fair in resolving disputes.<br /><br />I do not suggest being nitpicky. But when you get ripped-off, don&#039;t hesitate to rate the transaction accordingly.<br /><br />JeanRob

				<br /><br />Buying from well known and reputable vendors is the way to go. You might pay a bit more but chances are they will not screw you over.<br /><br />I also have seen all of these &quot;newer&quot; vendors with 5/5&#039;s and think dang SR only attracts decent people who happen to deal on the side.&nbsp; :-\

				Actually, to be clear, no vendor threatened to blacklist me.<br /><br />I just read it on a vendor&#039;s profile page and was surprised to see that.

				I have been seeing that on more and more vendors profiles recently. They say they will put you name on the &quot;vendor only forum&quot; to blacklist you. If the product and/or service deserves it then give the appropriate score and back it up with your feedback. If you have good stats most vendors are going to sell to you regardless of what another vendor says, as long as you don&#039;t make a habit of slamming every vendor you deal with. I have given several less than 5/5&#039;s and no one has ever turned me down as a customer (I have stellar stats, over 40 buys, over $7,000 spent, 0 auto finalize, 0 refunds). Vendors aren&#039;t going to blacklist me because some vendor didn&#039;t like the score I gave them.

				&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago i was just being honest about the stealth of a package i received from a vendor and the stealth was real real bad and i could of very easily been done over it so i give a 2/5 and the next day i had 3 messages from the vendor with all sorts of threats.&nbsp; I thought it over and that it was not worth all the bullshit so went back and changed it to 4/5 but while i was there i made it quite clear what happened for all to read.&nbsp; I have worked out that the newbies are the target here.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are scammed , ripped off , lousy stealth and sold fake or cut garbage. It pisses me off that i am treated with no respect .&nbsp; I give everyone i come into contact with my utmost respect hoping to get the same back.&nbsp; Dont know why i bother.&nbsp; But thats the problem with the world nowadays.&nbsp; No one has respect and there ego is bigger than themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp;May as well go back out on the streets to buy me drugs at least you get to look em in the eye as ya doing it.
