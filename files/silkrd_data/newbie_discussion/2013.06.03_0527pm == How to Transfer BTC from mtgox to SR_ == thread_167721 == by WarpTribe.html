				You have to send the BTC to your SR wallet. You can find your SR wallet address under your account information.

				Step 1: Click &quot;funding options&quot; on the left sidebar.<br /><br />Step 2: Click &quot;withdraw funds&quot;.<br /><br />Step 3: Enter BTC address, tick appropriate boxes, click &quot;confirm&quot;.<br /><br />Step 4: Give your forehead a dope slap. :) <br /><br /><br />In all honesty, I got hung up with this for a couple minutes at one point too.

				So I&#039;m in the midst of transferring from MT Got to Blockchain and there is a green bar at the bottom of the page that says &quot;withdrawing&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did this once before and nothing was transferred.&nbsp; Will there be some sort of prompt that says my transfer went through?

				Duty. I did this and it said that my account on mt.gox is &#039;pending for verification&#039; It says i need to get verified... Someone else told me that since i loged in to mtgox using tor that i will need to provide verification of a legitamate identity, my own, or abandon my funds... wich isnt an option... Do you know how to bypass this BS? And thanks for the tips, will use block chain.<br /><br />Also if im forced to give my identity up on mtgox, will block chain eliminate the paper trail? or is it to risky..? Im only dealling with trip for the record, im just trying to get 5 drops really. Than i could delete the account, create another.. So considering are they really going to track me down if they trace me to mtgox over 5 drops?

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
