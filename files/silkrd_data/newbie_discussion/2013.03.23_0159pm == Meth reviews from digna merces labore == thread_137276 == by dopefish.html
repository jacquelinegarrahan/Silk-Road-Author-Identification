				Hi SRf<br /><br />Has anyone tried the meth from vendor digna merces labore ?<br />Reviews on quality etc. would be nice..<br /><br />Also, vendor calls it &quot;raremic methamphetamine&quot; <br />What does &quot;raremic&quot; mean ?<br /><br />Sry if i&#039;m being stupid here<br />Newbie.. ::)<br /><br />Regards

				Nevermind I found it and doesn&#039;t ship to the US. He&#039;s got biker meth...lol It&#039;s basically speed and either ingested, go anal, or maybe snort it. I would pass and find the crystal, the high is much better. But, he states it&#039;s 98%...wouldn&#039;t hurt to try. I heard that it&#039;s a different high than the crystals though.

				racemic,...<br /><br />During the various different reactions and reductions used to form compounds there are different levels of the compounds are formed that are although still the same stuff because of the way the compound is structured they can have wide ranging emerging properties.<br /><br />They are a reproducible and almost a universal state for many different substances so you can have racemic K, Meth and many many other things. It really just indicates its not as potent as say s-isomer, d-, l- etc. double bonds, lone pairs, hydrogen atoms etc and the way they play together and where they are and who they connect with has crazy different results that effect every aspect of the gear and its quality<br /><br />There is a lot more to it and I have oversimplified it so I would suggest it would be a good idea to google it and start learning... Seriously the smartest thing you and anyone else thinking of taking any drug can do and that is to educate yourself on the organic chemistry principles and procedures that are making your drugs.. Its interesting stuff&nbsp; and you will have a better understanding of the gear your buying. You may also learn something that could save your life one day or the life of someone around you but most important is the way your removing the chance of being ripped off and then snow jobbed by technical chemistry terms.<br /><br />:-)

				Thanks for replying teqno..<br />I live in the EU, so thats fine. :)<br />&quot;Biker meth&quot;...Thats what you call it in the US?.. lol... Guess it explains the cheaper price..<br />I&#039;ll take your advise, and do what I normally do... go for the crystals.

				I&#039;m bumping this thread since i&#039;d like to read more ratting from experienced metheads.<br />The digna merces labore&#039;s meth definitly get me high, but it&#039;s the only meth i ever tried .<br /><br />Also: racemic mean the powder is 50% levo-methamphetamine and 50% dextro-methamphetamine.<br />The one which get you high is the dextro.<br />the levo isomer is waaaaay less active

				In chemistry, a racemic mixture, or racemate&nbsp; is one that has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. A racemate is optically inactive, meaning that there is no net rotation of plane-polarized light. Although the two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, the rotations cancel because they are present in equal amounts. In contrast to the two pure enantiomers, which have identical physical properties except for the direction of rotation of plane-polarized light, a racemate sometimes has different properties from either of the pure enantiomers. Different melting points are most common, but different solubilities and boiling points are also possible.<br /><br />Pharmaceuticals may be available as a racemate or as the pure enantiomer, which might have different potencies. Some drug molecules are chiral, and the enantiomers have different effects on biological entities. They can be sold as one enantiomer or as a racemic mixture. Examples include thalidomide, ibuprofen, and salbutamol. Adderall is a mixture of several different amphetamine enantiomers. A single amphetamine dose combines the neutral sulfate salts of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and D/L-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. The prescription analgesic tramadol is also a racemate.<br /><br />In some cases (e.g., ibuprofen and thalidomide), the enantiomers interconvert or racemize in vivo. This means that preparing a pure enantiomer for medication is largely pointless. However, sometimes samples containing pure enantiomers may be made and sold at a higher cost in cases where the use requires specifically one isomer (e.g., for a stereospecific reagent); compare omeprazole and esomeprazole.<br /><br />While often only one enantiomer of the drug may be active, in cases like salbutamol[5] and thalidomide, the other enantiomer may be harmful. The (R) enantiomer of thalidomide is effective against morning sickness, while the (S) enantiomer is teratogenic, causing birth defects. Since the drug racemizes, the drug cannot be considered safe for use by women of child-bearing age, and its use is tightly controlled when used for treating other illness.<br /><br />Methamphetamine is available by prescription under the brand name Desoxyn. The active component of Desoxyn is dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. This is the right-hand isomer of methamphetamine. The left-handed isomer of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an OTC drug that is less centrally-acting and more peripherally-acting.<br /><br />So really the addition of the term racemic on the listing is superfluous and has little to no bearing on the effects the drug will have on any user. If its uncut and true racemic it could be the nicest little solid crystal you have seen and be a strong substance however if its cut and 60/40 split of the isomers then it may still be as strong as the pure depending on just how cut it is and which is 40 and which is 60 percent of the mix.. if its true racemic and not cut it should be a clean and strong high that lasts a fair while. mild euphoria may be experienced but little increase in libido can be expected with the high being more clear headed and super motivated to go running or dig a hole and a rise in core body temp will be noticeable as the high progress. In higher doses the feeling of euphoria will increase but the high may become too intense resulting in jittery and random behavior.. Biker speed basically as was said earlier.
