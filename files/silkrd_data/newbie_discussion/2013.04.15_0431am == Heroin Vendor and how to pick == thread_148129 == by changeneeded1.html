				It sucks having to read peoples reviews who know nothing of opiates and those who seem to write almost non reviews.<br /><br />I am on 2mg of subs and im looking to not have to buy on the street anymore. The street stuff is very powerfull right now but the cops are all over it since only two spots in the city have the good stuff.<br /><br />Ive had mindgurus, #4 and stealthRx and charliemustthrive BTH<br /><br />Mindgurus was very strong but no rush and no euphoria. I could shoot up like .05( i weighed it) and be on a NOD and vomiting. Which is very weird cause normally it would take like 6-9 bags of the street stuff to do that. BUT the street stuff 3 bags gets me on the nod just fine with a great rush and euphoria with long 24hr legs.&nbsp; The color of the street stuff is clear see through and light to dark brown. His was yellow and clear. seethrough. The BTH is closest to what i have gotten on the street just not as strong. It took me about a halfa gram to get the same effect i get from the streetbags. I mean the BTH would take me half a gram. With stealth&#039;s it was closer to like .3. But still with grams going for 150-250$ Buying on the street that bundle of 14 bags for 90$ is still worth it way more. I dont wanna do that anymore so if anyone out there WHO knows about tolerance and has the proper experience please let me know.<br /><br />im interested In dragoncoves, Marlos, &amp; tommrowmans &amp; supreme smoke.<br />SO can someone people answer the following:<br /><br />What color is their liquid when mixed for IV solution.<br />How intense is the rush? Or is there a rush<br />How intense is the euphoria after the rush?<br />How much of their product does it take you to BREAKthru the Suboxone (if your taking any) (the streetbags i shoot up 3 bags litterly an hour after taking my 2mg sub and i will feel it , i wont nod But i will get the rush and euphoria. <br /><br />SO can someone please answer these.<br />Also did anyone else have the same experience with Mindgurus.&nbsp; I ordered his 5gram back in december. And it was rocks and turned clear but yellow seethrough. Very strong nod and vommiting and easy to makeyourself sick on it but no rush and no euphoria. Thanks For you help

				How was CharlieMustThrive&#039;s BTH?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had Purest&#039;s and it&#039;s just as good as the best shit that I can get on the streets.&nbsp; I was wondering how CharlieMustThrive&#039;s stuff compares.
