				no oxygen in the space so it does not &#039;burn&#039;. Its the nuclear fusion that takes place in its core.. maybe? :P

				&nbsp;Ok i have another question then&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is it that sun spots are black and that you can see into the middle of the sun ?&nbsp; Is it that the sun is hollow and its cold inside ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also NASA have said and proven that it gets hotter the more you move away from the sun like it is burning from the outside in..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;One of the comments said you need oxygen for it to burn .&nbsp; There is no oxygen in space but on the other hand electricity dont need oxygen to produce heat.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it been proven it can not be nuclear fusion for if it was then the sun would be at its hottest at its surface and not out in space like it is.<br /><br />&nbsp;The sun is fueled by plasma &quot; electricity &quot; Not nuclear fusion like they tell us.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;One more little note to get the brain ticking.&nbsp; &nbsp;The speed of light is not the fastest thing there is.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its electricity again.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you get a 1 and add 33 zeros in front of it then that is how much electricity is faster than the speed of light. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000&nbsp; &nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; If you find that hard to believe then do yourself a favor and check out Holoscince&nbsp; &nbsp;ie;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Electric Universe Theory and or The ThunderBoltsProject

				&nbsp;The crackpot theories are usually the ones that turn out true and correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;To quote a few crackpots on this theory we have people such as,<br /><br />&nbsp; Nicola Tesla<br />&nbsp; Raymond Rife<br />&nbsp; Immanuel Velikovsky<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; And yes please do have a look at this crackpot theory&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp;There is a canyon on mars that is 3 times bigger than the grand canyon and mars is half the size of earth . So on a scale that would make it 6 times bigger than the grand canyon.&nbsp; And ill let you in on a little secret it was NOT make from water and erosion.&nbsp; take a guess how it was make.&nbsp; The name of the canyon is Valles Marineris&nbsp;

				Hey i seen that shit on youtube&nbsp; &nbsp;That canyon on mars wraps half way around the planet and yeah water didnt make it.&nbsp; It was a fucking big lighting bolt from another planet..&nbsp; They say thats how the planets protect themselves from other planets and other shit getting to close to each other.&nbsp; And that mars had one mother fucker of a hit with that one hay bro.

Einstein showed in the early 1900&#039;s that the speed of light was constant for any frame of reference; it&#039;s based on two universal constants ε0, the vaccuum permittivity of space and µ0, the vaccuum permeability of space. The speed of light cant be exceeded by anything. The concept of electricity is really just a bunch of electrons all moving in a general direction, and it&#039;s much slower than light. The electrons are subject to friction in whatever material they&#039;re in. That&#039;s why your laptop power supply is hot. <br /><br />As an object approaches the speed of light, time slows down when compared to us. For instance, the astronauts in the ISS are a fraction of a second younger than they would be if they were on the surface of earth.<br />As you get faster and faster, time keeps on slowing. In fact, if something were to go faster than light, they would start to experience time backwards. So if you were to send a message with your &quot;electricity&quot; that is faster than light, the recipient would actually get it before you sent it.

				Is all i have to say is check out The Electric Universe ( Holoscience ) and the Thonderbolts Project and come back and talk to me then&nbsp; &nbsp;Einstein himself said before he died that he could not get his theory to add up .....

				The Sun is MUCH hotter on the inside that on the outside, so using this premise I&#039;d say that it burns from the outside in.<br /><br />BUT, as burning implies rapid, exothermic reaction with oxygen, then I&#039;d say it doesn&#039;t burn at all: it FUSES!<br /><br />

				Tesla did some incredible work, invented our whole AC distribution system but died penniless in a dive of a hotel, while George Westinghouse (or whatever) got extremely rich.<br />But this thread is so off topic I don&#039;t know what it is is doing here.

				@Nakorx<br /><br />because drugs can interfere with just about every step in the work of neurotransmitters in the human body..<br /><br />neurotransmitters are chemicals that stimulate a neuron and once stimulated a electrical charge is released which stimulates the release of the neurotransmitters.This is known as an electrochemical because it combines chemicals (neurotransmitters) and electricity in the form of ions.<br /><br />electricity is integral to the working of the human body as well as the universe around us.<br /><br />this i&#039;m sure is not the reason it&#039;s posted here but i thought i&#039;d put it out there.<br /><br />pretty sure BonRipBeaMat would be far more eloquent.<br /><br /><br />
