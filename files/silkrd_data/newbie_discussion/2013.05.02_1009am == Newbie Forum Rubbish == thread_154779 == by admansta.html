I have suggested perhaps having one or two mega-threads that will be tolerated as long as people leave the actual discussion threads spam-free. When we have direction on that we will let people know.<br /><br />The captcha can be quite difficult at times (I had to go through captcha hell myself with this new account so I can definitely empathise with members who don&#039;t appreciate it) but it is an unfortunate necessity to combat spambots. There are many programs available that can defeat captchas with ever-increasing accuracy and having it on a lower difficulty would negate the reason for having a Newbie forum in the first place as the spambots could hit 50 posts in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />I also understand what you&#039;re saying about this not being explained to new members; I will see when we receive direction about the spam issue if it is appropriate to place a Sticky informing them as to the reasons they are restricted to this forum. I spent the majority of my time helping members out from my previous forum identity and appreciate the others who take the time to do so as well.

It is their problem and in a free community such as this, it is something that they will simply have to learn to deal with! We enjoy great freedom here, and that is something that I will vehemently defend for all. This forum is not just a forum for people to discuss drugs, it is a place where we can speak freely and openly on any topic without fear of retribution or censorship and that is incredibly, incredibly important.

				Thank you for your reply. I didn&#039;t remember about the catchpa needing to be on a high difficulty setting (fast refresh rate). I appreciate the rest of the reply too, and it made sense. Yes, a few mega threads for spamming would tend to remove spam from normal threads. Some just pick any thread to spam, including important threads, and I think that is not on at all.
