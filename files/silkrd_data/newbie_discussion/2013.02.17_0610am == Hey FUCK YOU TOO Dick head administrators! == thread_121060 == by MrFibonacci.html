				When the hell did all this 50 post minimum shit start!? Last week I tried leaving a review for one of my favorite sellers cuz they asked me to and I couldn&#039;t find the reply button. I was in a hurry and got frustrated trying to figure it out. I figured some how I must be trippin&#039; so I decided I&#039;d do it another day and now I find I can&#039;t post hardly anywhere! So I&#039;m not allowed to ask for help in the &#039;Security&#039; forums until I post FIFTY times!? Just to give you an idea of how much that really is just cuz I haven&#039;t been a high profile member for 5 years it&#039;s like 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. 7.. 8.. 9.. 10.. 1l.. 12.. 13.. 14.. Oh never mind you get the idea. I&#039;ll stop there, cuz I&#039;m not a total douche bag. How the hell does that make sense? These are designed to help people. What if your question has to do with a particular thread that&#039;s completely unrelated to the noob forums? It&#039;s for &quot;SECURITY!&quot; That takes precedence over a couple annoying questions. Does the administration realize that fifty posts is a whole lot to the people that aren&#039;t forum junkies. It&#039;s ridiculous. My buyer stats are as follows:<br /><br />Total transactions: 28<br />Total spent: $3685.01<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months<br /><br />How the fuck you gonna tell me on a forum related to the SR that I&#039;m not qualified to post!? I&#039;m pretty angry. I&#039;ve spent all morning trying to get BTC&#039;s, including running around town and back on the CPU since more and more sources are being attacked and making it harder for a lot of us and I don&#039;t need this right now. It&#039;s not cool. What if someone were to take a break for a while and forgot their password? When I first joined I lost my password to the account that matches my SR account and I could not get a password retrieval no matter how hard I tried so I made another account. Any one with me on this!?

				Were lucky enough to even have access too SR.. I think complaining about something as small as this is irrelevant, while I&#039;m understanding of you being angry that you are a consistent SR user and cannot post in the desired section, a high post count shows dedication and frequent use of this site, therefore giving other members an idea of who the people are that know what they are talking about.<br />This can be annoying for people who aren&#039;t heavy Forum users.. but look at me . I&#039;m still waiting for certain things to be verified so I can start buying BTC, and I&#039;m already posting on the forum... getting this 50 post count deal over with. Best of luck man

				The admins implemented this policy in order to help protect the community against the bitcoin spammers who were scamming people left and right.<br /><br />Also, if you do a search for it, you will find a thread started by PrincessHIGH where she offers to post people&#039;s reviews in the official review thread for their vendor for them, if they are still stuck in the newbie section.

				I believe one of the main reasons why the &#039;Newbies&#039; discussion was created was to stop the &#039;silkroadtor.com&#039; &#039;mt gix&#039; &#039;vir wex&#039; &#039;bitcoincointakls.com&#039; spambot from plaguing the discussion boards with its endless assault, there was a time not too long ago in the past where this bot would bombard the boards with so much spam we&#039;d have to go through ten pages just to find the &#039;real threads&#039;, it was insane! The other reason, perhaps, is some &#039;Newbies&#039; (not all) kept repeatedly asking the same questions over and over again when the answers to these questions are freely available on the forum, all is required to locate these answers is a quick two second search, or through the archives. On the other side of the coin MrFibonacci, I feel your frustrations, however the forum is running a lot more smoothly than it was previously. You may not be able to post in &#039;Security&#039; but you can post in the &#039;Customer service&#039; discussion board dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=25.0 alternatively you could pm a forum administrator DPR or inigo, or a moderator scout or samesamebutdifferent with your security query. If you would like me to quote your review to the vendor&#039;s review thread please post it here &#039;The official Newbies discussion &#039;Post Your Review Here&#039; thread!&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120309 I&#039;m happy to help you :)

				If the OP has been here for very long, then he should know exactly what the forums were like as far as that bitcoin spam / scam went before the admins implemented this policy.&nbsp; It flooded all of the forums and we had no way to control it before it was all over the place.<br /><br />With the new policy in place, we at least have a little time to catch the spammers, delete their scamming attempts, and ban them before they reach the 50 posts that would allow them to flood all of the other subforums.&nbsp; It&#039;s for containment, and to give us a bit of an advantage in protecting the community from the spammers.&nbsp; (the ones who were spamming by starting hundreds of threads all night to advertise their scamming sites like &quot;mtgix&quot; &quot;btkoin&quot; &quot;bitcointalks&quot; and &quot;virwex&quot;)<br /><br />The OP is free to be as upset as he wants and to vent about it, but everyone else faces the same 50 post rule before being able to post on the main forums, and being angry about it (and cursing the people who made this site / marketplace possible) isn&#039;t going to do anything to help the situation.

				Dude lay off the admins. Your &quot;trippy&quot; mind wouldn&#039;t be able to wrap itself on all the worries they have. You even knowing about them is a privilege in itself. There is a reason for the 50 limit and if you were properly educated on how to use this site you would realize this. This is despicable to say to them. Your $5000&lt; isn&#039;t shit to what kind of money goes through this site in a MINUTE. Also you are such an insignificant figure in anyone world that I would bank on a admin or mod never even seeing this thread, much less even looking twice at it.

				Are you kidding me? I mean.. nah.. it&#039;s cool, because I knew there would be at least one person telling me I don&#039;t have a right to bitch. Another reason I even chose to start this thread was to get more posts in dummy. Lol People never cease to surprise me. I usually make the best of it, but like I&#039;ve stated it&#039;s not been the most lax day. I also initiated this to hopefully get some attention on the subject. I fully believe that this new rule should be reevaluated for it&#039;s pros, cons and legitimacy. It seems a little prejudice and lazy to me to just force people to post when they don&#039;t want to or make it difficult for them to want to post at all. When I first started using Silk Road and the forums it wasn&#039;t a requirement to have all these posts. I have every right to be upset. I don&#039;t like that you&#039;re accusing me of taking the road for granted either, because I love it. It&#039;s helped save my life to a dramatic extent, but that&#039;s really not the point at all. To act like I&#039;m not aware of all of this just because I disagree with a new rule unrelated to actually purchasing something is insulting much like I find it insulting that before I could post freely and when I&#039;m trying to give a good review to a loyal seller I can&#039;t. And on that note. I doubt you&#039;ll see this, but thank you Jennifers! You&#039;re my main bitch. Those women always hook it up and have the best customer service I&#039;ve experienced so I think they deserve some feedback without going through this Obama reform to do it. The fact is that as amazing and beautiful SR is as a personal godsend to me and our online community alike it&#039;s a business and I&#039;m&nbsp; paying customer. And sure a high post count shows dedication. I&#039;ve always liked that about all forums. It makes it fun. This is not fun. It&#039;s a giant totalitarian pain in the ass! Hey Faces. When did you even join the road yourself? A week ago? Cuz if that&#039;s the case then I guess... &quot;No, you don&#039;t understand what&#039;s it&#039;s like to be a frequent customer and not be able to post in the desired section.&quot; Spent all the time and money I have into this thing!! Mind your place Jr. And the other one. The b999 guy. Funny! (: ... But you&#039;ve still chosen to be my enemy. I do have the right to bitch, because I was apart of this before the policy was implemented. I was already more apart of the forum than any of you just tuning in. It&#039;s like being demoted. And thanks scout for the info, but it&#039;s still a weak policy. I&#039;ve personally never been scammed yet. The most trouble I had is how annoying it was to see the same thread posted over and over again. &quot;Cheap Coins&quot; Blah blah blah. I feel bad for those who have been scammed, but I don&#039;t think this is necessary. Not everybody is a posting whore. This isn&#039;t even the only forum I use in life. It&#039;s very time consuming to go through all this trouble. I have other things to do to you know!? <br /><br />That was my last take until PrincessHIGH posted, but I still stand by my idea to start the thread cuz otherwise I wouldn&#039;t have known any of this. 50 posts is still a lot! It could be lower for sure. And I can rant if I want to fag. Your bitch probably never screamed as hard in her life than from our great experience... You know? When I fucked her. She said you won&#039;t do the freaky shit she needs.

				And yeah. I&#039;m sorry I told you to fuck off. You guys do a good job at keeping the peace. I felt very vilified earlier. I thought it was all based on an intolerance to stupid questions and stuff. I think a lot of people thought that. So I was just trying to be the voice and kill some posts and I feel a lot better now that you have educated me on the subject. I didn&#039;t expect to get administrator attention. I figured I would more bullshit with other members that felt the same way and.. kill more posts.

				No worries - I understand the frustration and the implication of the 50 post rule for those who haven&#039;t necessarily been as active here.&nbsp; The rule was a surprise even to us as moderators, but we&#039;re all adjusting to it together, and there&#039;s always a chance that the staff will tweak the policy in the future (since it is still a very, very new policy!).&nbsp; <br /><br />It was not due to the posts of new members (you&#039;ll see some incredibly ridiculous questions from even the &quot;oldest&quot; members here!) -- it really was primarily created as a way to help us get a handle on the spam, especially since there are only a few of us moderators here, and none of us can be here 24/7.<br /><br />Anyway, I appreciate that you can kind of understand, even if it is still frustrating to you.<br /><br />(also, feel free to start a thread to spam to 50 posts, if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; there are a lot of threads like that in this section!)<br /><br />Thank you again for taking the time to express your opinion but also hear where we were coming from as well.&nbsp; :)

				Nah, I know. I was playing a little bit on the 50 thread. But like I said it&#039;s time consuming and I gotta data cap to worry about too. I hope they&#039;ll consider lowering it for everybody else. I&#039;ll probably be over my 50 by then.

				And White I didn&#039;t post my stats to brag. I was making a point.

				Just like in my real life, I tend to like listening more than I like talking.&nbsp; I have a medical condition that makes me unable to vocalize as volubly as others.&nbsp; I think the character of the forums changes with this new system in place that rewards people with high post counts, elevates them to the status of hero members, and wrongly misidentifies people with low post counts as newbies.&nbsp; What you have many times are people who I suspect are new to stimulants and take stimulants or are on stimulants when they come on here gabbing about this or that, and actually make the forums less readable.&nbsp; One of the most absurd things I saw after the 50 post count threshold was put in place, the former moderator nomad bloodbath was lamenting the proliferation of all the 50 post count spam threads, saying long-time members should be helping newbies, not trying to game the system.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; The whole system is designed to reward the kind of people who act before they think. <br /><br />Frankly, I don&#039;t see much difference between many hero members, and the so-called spammers you seem to dislike so much.<br /><br />Those of us who aren&#039;t forum junkies or who like to &quot;measure twice and cut once&quot;, as the saying goes, are now relegated to this section, and I&#039;m always on the lookout for people like me here, despite all the 50 post count spam threads.&nbsp; This is what I said before when I got a bit irritated with a hero member who admitted he was high on cocaine when he was wrongly accusing vendors of being scammers and responding to threads with pages of nonsense:<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=113406.msg772220#msg772220">Quote from: bodysativa on January 29, 2013, 01:50 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wanted to post on the thread in Rumor Mill, but don&#039;t have enough of a post count, so let me just say:<br /><br />springseed23 is a fucking scammer.&nbsp; This is the piece of shit&#039;s forum profile:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=21205<br /><br />Fuck springseed23, dude accused PablosPuro of being a scammer, when all these users came on saying they received his product.<br /><br />Fuck springseed23, springseed23 is a scammer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

It&#039;s good you appreciate the reason why the admin decided to take this action, though not ideal, it&#039;s solved far more problems than what it&#039;s caused. The reason why it&#039;s 50 posts before you gain full posting privileges is because your status changes from &#039;Newbie&#039; to &#039;Jr. Member&#039; then. Good news, you&#039;re over halfway to acquiring your &#039;Jr. Member&#039; status, only 23 posts to go.

				i personally feel that as a vendor, the user interface of SR needs a little improvement (especially after finding out how much money they make!). maybe connecting SR main site accounts to the forums through a pin number of some sort would help users get past the annoying 50 post mark. Vendors should be able to grant their customers an access pin of some sort to disable the 50 count requirement just for that person. as a vendor, I don&#039;t want to complain too much but small improvements like that would make SR a lot better.

				I&#039;m wondering if it wouldn&#039;t be better to restrict newbies to this forum based on the amount of time since registration instead of post count. If you just set it so people had to be signed up for a week, it seems like it would control the spambots as well or better than by post count and people would have no need to post in the spam threads. A week isn&#039;t very long to wait and if you signed up for the forums before using the marketplace, you&#039;ll probably hit the mark before you even finalize your first order.

				That&#039;s actually a pretty good idea avast, one I hadn&#039;t thought about, but then, thinking it through, the fucking spammer will automatically create a bunch of throwaway accounts, sit on them for a week, and promptly fill the forums with spam again.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s pretty clear we need GMail level spam detection, I have had experience with all the free email providers, and no one detects spam like Google, but even if there are open source tools that detect spam, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any way to get the spam detection libraries working with forums software like the one SRF runs on.
