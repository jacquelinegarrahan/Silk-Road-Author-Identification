				Don&#039;t be like me and lose 10,000 total to FE. <br /><br /><br />When I came here on the road I was fooled by low prices and took a long time to realize that there is one rule. NEVER FE. I had a great business going until I ran into SKYY and now Foxbelle77 who have taken me for large amounts of coin. <br /><br /><br />Let me losing 10,000 (10,000 here on the road-- 40,000 when I hand it off here) be a lesson to all the newbies... DON&#039;T FE. Never FE even when you feel like you have a relationship with a vendor here. Only YOU can be the one to decide whether or not you allow them to make outrageous rules, such as having to FE!! <br /><br />

When you receive your good, you release the money to the seller. Releasing it before you receive your goods is called finalizing early.<br />You shouldn&#039;t really do it. The state.&nbsp; is there to protect you AND the seller. <br />Some sellers insist on it though, if you&#039;re a brand new customer with zero purchasing history.&nbsp;

				For safety reasons, always remember to FE in real life. You might get robbed, but if u tell the guy &quot;I ain&#039;t finalizing early, show me dat shit&quot; you might get hurt. Spring jackets with pockets actually have a &quot;pocket escrow&quot; system built in where u get to compare the inside of your pocket with your dealer. Your dealer should have whatever shit u wanted and ur pocket should be lined with the cash.<br /><br />Now if we can integrate those anti-rape devices into this pocket escrow system, we may have more fair street deals.

Didn&#039;t have to fe, as long as I was willing to sign for the parcel. Came swiftly, can not wait to re order. <br /><br />Also, on the subject of FE, while I understand NEVER, we all start at zero and have to build our stats. I bought from vendors that didn&#039;t require it where possible, in the beginning, but a couple of times I took a chance. I was never ripped off. One order, 100 Green Questions Marks from Supertrips never arrived, and then he was gone for some time. I noticed he was back though, sent him a message, and he sent me the coin. That was SIX MONTHS after the fact. I was so pleased! A good solid vendor there. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m still a Newbie cause I don&#039;t post much but I have some experience on the road and I say avoid it where possible, but if you&#039;re gonna do it research your vendor.

				I&#039;m going to be making my first purchase soon and I have to FE. The vendor (LucyDrop) insists on FE, but she also has the best deal on LSD so I&#039;m gonna go for it. Yeah it&#039;s a risk I&#039;m taking but she has 99 pos. feedback with hundreds of transactions, and the 1 percent who didn&#039;t receive their mail got a refund. Her reputation speaks for itself imo. I wouldn&#039;t FE with anyone else though... Just don&#039;t order large amounts and make sure the vendor has great rep, do your homework! Read the feedback on their vendor page, ask about them in the forums and decide for yourself if it&#039;s worth the risk.

				early finalize an order of 10000$ was crazy man... have to buy carefully ALWAYS. start with small orders, look if the stealth works good, look from what countries are you buying, or where want to ship your orders... each customer have lot of options to buy from many sellers adjusting to your needs.<br /><br />when i started on SR with my customer account i´ve been scammed too for finalizing early one order. at least was a small order and that have been enough to learn the lesson.

If you finalize early from this guy or anyone else, most likely at some point, they will steal your money. It&#039;s been happening continuously since SR started, a vendor will ask for FE, wait for a massive order to come in and then disappear with the money.<br /><br />FE is there for a reason, to protect vendors and buyers. If you FE you have no recourse to claim your money back and I guarantee you will lose it more often than not.

I&#039;m actually going to make my first purchases tomorrow and I&#039;m quite glad that I read this. Not for the fact that It was common sense to me to do so anyways but the fact that some sellers have really good feedback. I&#039;m not talking about like &quot;xtcexpress&quot; but others who have great reviews yet not top ranked. I was debating and like I mentioned earlier I&#039;m not gonna purchase for buyers who request FE. Early lesson learned. Thanks for stating it clear OP!

				Sorry to hear about your loss mate Iv had similar experience with FE, as a newbie I was desperate to try some different coke, all three people I went to on the road req FE for 10 or less transactions successful ones, so without the 10 I dived straight in, I currently have 2 not shown up and 1 that did show up. Small amounts that I can just about afford but still roughly £100 each so I&#039;m 200 down with FE <br />The two Im waiting on are big sellers, big reps, one has just told me I will get a reship which is good- he also offered a refund which I thought for a newbie like me was pretty good but desperate to try the stuff and already paid out I went for reship<br />Sonicdrones was an FE and it arrived no problem<br />Other vendor has a 15 minimum transaction or FE req and I&#039;m waiting on that arriving, thats been 9 days- I do think that without FE I get the feeling the parcels may have arrived...........but just shows the OP says he built up a relationship then got stung that is rare surely?<br />&nbsp;

				Before making any purchases you should ALWAYS lurk the forums first, read every sticky, read every thread that has questions you are un sure of.<br /><br />The main site, the new posts, PGP, vendor pages, feedback comments and anything else that you can find.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry that you lost such a large amount of money there OP but it is well documented that you should never FE unless you really want to and it is at your own risk.<br /><br />I&#039;ll NEVER FE ! I&#039;ll keep searching vendors to find one that does not require it, or just not buy anything at all.<br /><br />The Escrow system is there in place to help out everyone, bypassing it is at your own risk and you should understand that.<br /><br />As for being a new member and complaining that you have to FE, that is not always true. As long as you are honest, follow the rules and talk to all of the vendors you want to deal with you should never have to deal with.<br /><br />You can build up your first 5 - 10 transactions pretty fast, weather it be physical goods or virtual there is always a way.<br /><br />Another method is also using the same name on the forums as your buyers account and then a vendor can see what kind of person you are from what you post.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw

				Just means finalize early, you&#039;re finalizing the transaction so the funds are released from escrow.&nbsp; Your BTC are supposed to be held by SR until your order arrives successfully, and then you finalize and SR pays your BTC to the vendor.&nbsp; If you finalize before you receive your package, you&#039;re finalizing early (FE).<br /><br />I assume you probably knew this but whatever it&#039;s another post on my way to fifty and it might actually help you out some if you truly don&#039;t understand this.

				That sucks. That&#039;s crazy in fact. I got ripped off 12 hundred on the internet and that was supposed to be through a legit RC vendor. Not on the road. I&#039;ve never been cheated on the road. I&#039;ve had some shit weigh a little shy, but I&#039;ve also had shit weigh over. One time I bought bunk and got reimbursed almost immediately. I&#039;ve never FE&#039;d except on one large ass purchase, because it was a requirement. A lot of people FE for their favorite vendors and that&#039;s fine, but I&#039;ve seen a few cats who start out with outstanding reputations suddenly split. I&#039;m sure they never intended it that way, but when shit hit the fan they took the easy way out.

				TALK TO YOUR FUCKING VENDOR BEFORE PURCHASING!<br /><br />You can usually get out of FE&#039;ing by asking the vendor. Every penny your FE is a penny thrown into the ocean with no hope of recovery.<br /><br />The only item I&#039;ve FE&#039;d for was thirteen bucks worth of 2cb from Div. It was only a couple days ago, and I don&#039;t think Div is going to risk his reputation for thirteen bucks, but if he selectively scams me I&#039;ll make it the most expensive thirteen bucks hes ever stolen. Let the review hang there until it arrives. After it arrives, give your vendor his/her 5/5 and state about how long it took to arrive.<br /><br /><br />DO NOT FUCKING RELENT; If you are scammed, EVERYONE HAS TO KNOW. IT IS YOUR DUTY! IT IS YOUR MOTHERFUCKING DUTY TO LET EVERYONE ON THE SILK ROAD KNOW WHO SELECTIVELY SCAMS. No vendor will scam 100% of his/her customers, only selective scamming exists.

				I know FE&#039;ing is bad, but sometimes you&#039;ve got to FE or else this market would never succeed. Do you honestly expect vendors to be able to expand when there are consumer scammers and there capital is locked up in escrow. I&#039;m a buyer, and have never been asked to FE. FE&#039;ing, the way i see it is fair game. In real life that would never happen... Sometimes you have to take risks, and if you get fucked over you get fucked over.. bound to happen some day

				I never FE unless I&#039;m willing to just say goodbye to that money. For example, when a smaller order I had made didn&#039;t show, the vendor offered a 50% refund or a reship if I finalized early. Since a 50% refund was going to be like $20.00, I finalized, and actually did receive my reship.

				Really, the more of us who refuse to FE the less vendors will demand it. I wish everyone would just stand up and refuse it across the board and it would be gone overnight. Maybe some recourse should be available to sellers if they have to wait 2 weeks for some lazy person who won&#039;t get on to finalize, but I always finalize within a day of receiving, and usually the whole thing is complete within 3 days of me pressing the order button. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s an unreasonable amount of time to wait, and it encourages quick shipping too.<br /><br />I will never ever FE and any vendor who requires it will just not get my bitcoins.

				Even if it&#039;s the greatest vendor in the world, it makes no sense whatsoever to FE. That&#039;s like going to a random street corner, giving Jo Blow your money while he &quot;goes to get the product&quot; from Bobby Jo Fuckstick or whoever is higher in command. News flash: you&#039;re probably fucked. If an issue comes up with shipping or whatever, you&#039;ll have no recourse. The best vendors may offer to throw in a little extra for your next order, but there&#039;s no guarantee. It baffles me to see FE after FE after FE for large orders. I recently saw feedback from a user saying &quot;FE for trusted vendor. First order but the reviews are solid.&quot; This was for a QP of weed! Dumbass.

				Are we supposed to &quot;report vendor&quot; if bein ripped off after FE?<br />On the sr buyer guide it says- <br />&quot;NEVER go around the escrow&quot; otherwise &quot;we will be totally unable to protect you&quot; +<br />&quot;Our commitment is to total satisfaction for every purchase you make here.&quot; but <br />i&#039;ve come across to that every UK Heroin vendor asks you to FE unless you have 10<br />successful transaction, the only vendor who doesn&#039;t require it is TopNotch<br />who i was buying from and always had smnooth transactions and good service<br />&nbsp;and i now have 9 successful transactions but unfortunately<br />&nbsp;on 2 different accounts ( my original account pin stopped working for some reason,<br />&nbsp;not because i forgot it, but it just wouldn&#039;t accept it, so i had to open 2nd account<br />because was urgent to make a purchase). Now for some reason TN doesn&#039;t have active listings anymore<br />and i can&#039;t buy my stuff anywhere else because everyone wants you to FE. At some point i had experience with <br />another wellknown uk H vendor, he asked me to FE which i did - got my stuff next day<br />&nbsp;( it was only 0.2 g), so when i purchased from him again and he asked to FE again, <br />of cource i did ( it was 1g) and package didn&#039;t arrive. Every single time before<br />&nbsp;that and after it made my door (all were local vendors), <br />so my address is not black listed, and my concern is - whether it was sent or<br />&nbsp;i was scamed, I PMed him again after some time regarding my purchase, he asked to FE again.<br />But i&#039;m not doing it again!<br />So what do we newbies have to do to be able to buy safely!?<br /><br />I&#039;ve resently got an advice - to buy books or play lotery to get stats, but i don&#039;t need <br />them books and don&#039;t want to waste money!<br />How come SR tells us to stay on escrow always but allowes vendors to ask people to FE!?<br />Wouldn&#039;t that be more fair to say something like &quot;newbies can&#039;t buy more then 0.2 g untill <br />they have 10 successful transactions&quot;?

				Yeah.....it feels bad man :(&nbsp; I didn&#039;t follow this advice on my last order and I know better. I was at 7 transactions and the seller required 10 for escrow.&nbsp; I even told myself as I was hitting the finalize button that this was not the right move. Seller was Space Factory and that was 13 days ago. I&#039;m probably rushing to judgement too soon as this was my first international order. But luckily it was only for a g of mdma that I bought with coin that I bought like six months ago when they were going for under 80 usd. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: Never Except for SPACE FACTORY!!!!!!&nbsp; I got my FE&#039;d order today. Took 18 days from the NL and I freaked for nuttin&#039;. Overweight and outstanding product!!!

				If you are new do not FE for anything that you aren&#039;t willing to lose.&nbsp; There are plenty of vendors offering digital goods such as books and what not that will get you above 10 transactions with no risk.&nbsp; You may have to waste money on some digital goods but it may be worth it in the long run

Just as we buyers are in danger of scamming vendors, so are legit vendors sometimes in danger of scamming buyers. Think of all the shit a junkie would say/do in order to NOT pay for something. In real life there&#039;s no chance they&#039;d try something like that because they&#039;d be putting themselves in physical danger. But behind all this anonymity, and ESPECIALLY if a buyer is brand-new and has no stats, a vendor has no way of knowing the difference between a well-intentioned buyer willing to pay for product or a down-and-out junkie who&#039;s looking for any way possible to get a refund for gear that was properly shipped and received. <br /><br />So, I guess, I would say I don&#039;t understand UNESTABLISHED vendors requiring new buyers to FE. Established vendors have an existing pipeline of business and could do without the possible headaches of accepting all new buyers. Just wanted to point out an established vendor who DOES NOT require FE from new buyers: MarloStanfield. He is unique in that I think he conveys through his profile that... he&#039;s really not one to be fucked with. I don&#039;t know what that would actually mean if somebody did try to scam him because vendors are NOT supposed to keep things like addresses, but... yeah. In any case, to the person looking to buy H with less than 10 purchases, I guess Marlo&#039;s your man. I buy everything but H on SR but it seems like he keeps his customers pretty happy. He&#039;s even reshipping orders to everyone who got any of the last batch of H he was selling, which turned out to be bad. Very professional.

I would like to trust the vendors who have done right by me, but in reality, as long as we&#039;re anonymous, we&#039;re also unaccountable (unless having people hate us on the forums makes us cry and beg for forgiveness, of course).&nbsp; Even for a vendor whom I believe to be honest and professional, I would never FE more than I could easily handle losing.

				I have never had a problem on the road until I FE&#039;d for a sample of MDPV from qd8714. Seller sure did deliver to people but not to me. I guess since I FE&#039;d for $8 they didn&#039;t feel required to honor my purchase. Now the seller is &quot;wrapping it up&quot;. Probably going to see their listings again under a different profile. If we as a community STOP finalizing early the scammers will dry up. They live for the scam and when their resources dry up they will go away because, it is not profitable. My lesson only cost me less than $10 but, why lose a penny? Dont FE!

				SR&#039;s official stance is opposed to FE, but it is only against the rules for new vendors to ask buyers to FE. After a vendor has 35 transactions and has been vending for 1 month, s/he is allowed to set his/her own FE requirements. <br /><br />As long as buyers will go for it, sellers will require it.&nbsp; The only way to stop it is for everyone to refuse to FE, and if a vendor chooses not to do business within escrow, find a different vendor.

				Seriously guys I would never FE and it really has nothing to do with the money. For me it has to do with destroying the integrity of a system that is completely cutting edge and nearly perfect. Honestly if you FE the money you lose doesn&#039;t bother me at all, it is a small price that you are paying to do a great amount of harm to this institution for everyone. Flame me if you like but those are my principles, look elsewhere for sympathy.

				Ugh, this is making me very nervous.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not yet placed my first order, but will likely do so soon with one of the highest rated cola vendors (expensive, but quality) with whom I have already exchanged some private correspondence.&nbsp; Whilst he&#039;s happy for me (as a newbie) to escrow purchase up to 2.5g, I was intending to buy an 8-ball and (until reading this thread) was quite happy to FE.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to start what (I hope) could become a good long-term relationship on the wrong foot by asking him to trust on escrow a delivery larger than he would normally be willing for a newbie, but at the same time I can&#039;t help feeling that I may be setting myself up for a fall.<br /><br />I guess my most obvious option would be to buy a smaller volume until he trusts me enough to send larger amounts on escrow, but I&#039;m more inclined to take a bigger risk (whilst it&#039;s money that I can afford to lose, I&#039;d miss the candy and wouldn&#039;t want to work with him again).<br /><br />What do you reckon?&nbsp; One of us has to trust the other, so I figure I may as well step up.

				Yeah, as tempting as it is for first-time buyers* to FE, it&#039;s better to just find vendors who are sympathetic to the cause. You might pay a little more or have more limited options, but... we&#039;re in a black market here. It&#039;s kinda how that works. <br /><br />But think about the benefits: you get to see peer and client reviews here that would rarely, if ever, happen on &quot;the street.&quot; Yes prices tend to be a little higher, but availability and transparency beat that hands-down.<br /><br />*(which are not necessarily newbs -- I&#039;ve been here for almost a year and only recently placed my first order)

				Like Catalan said though, <br /><br />It would suck if after a few comfortable and honest PM&#039;s w/ the vendor, and reading the endless listings he has, and his fan base, and all the reviews on the bottom, and having lurked around to watch his progress and how awesome they package and take care and the whole spiel, you confront the vendor about the escrow thing and then the vendor get&#039;s mad and then refuses to sell you that awesome item you&#039;ve been drooling over.&nbsp; I almost feel like going against SR&#039;s rule of thumb is kinda the last anarchistic behavior that not only gains trust on how much balls you have, but can possibly turn out to be the biggest ice breaker in the vendor/buyer relationship. Don&#039;t we do that sometimes anyways when we cop on the streets.&nbsp; I&#039;ve handed a complete stranger a few grand expecting him to come back in a minute, and he did.&nbsp; (North Philly (USA) Dealers are the Shit)&nbsp; Hell I&#039;ve done it on the clearnet grabbing up cheap RC&#039;s.&nbsp; Oddly enough, the only time a package didn&#039;t make it was when it was a free sample.&nbsp; Dude suddenly dropped his email and never posted up anything else on the forum and everyone expecting a sample also was like ????&nbsp; &nbsp;I had the paranoid idea that maybe it was a fed trying to grab addy&#039;s but the compound is quasy legal.&nbsp; Though the same crowd are avid fans of Group Buys in which one person makes a massive order w/ everyone&#039;s money and then everyone is supposed to get a way better deal than usual for helping out in the massive purchase.&nbsp; These seem to have more failure than the latter. I had taken an extra measure w/ the vendor by revealing him a hidden name my box get&#039;s all the time that the mail man seems to think lives here since he never takes the names mail back and hasn&#039;t for many moons.&nbsp; &nbsp;And as Catalan explained, money is money, I&#039;d hate to loose $100 for not following the rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why exactly is there no mod on the road that can stop vendors from putting up on their listing stipulations like FE????<br /><br />I&#039;m kinda worried myself now, dude has not processed the order.&nbsp; I had already led him to believe I would FE the order.&nbsp; But this and other thread, including the wiki all tell me not too.&nbsp; Though he explicitly says, trust it will be worth it, it works both ways.&nbsp; But come to think about it, how could i fuck him if I don&#039;t even know his addy?????&nbsp; Do vendors get screwed like on eBay where people claim they didn&#039;t get the package to get their btc&#039;s back????/&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the ratio ????

I&#039;m having an issue with a vendor (or, rather, a vendor I&#039;ve ordered from is having widespread issues -- an apparent rarity for him), and I&#039;ll likely wind up getting a 75% refund on this one transaction (my second). Honestly I&#039;m hoping the product arrives and I *don&#039;t* need a refund, but... something shit happens. <br /><br />So I&#039;m curious -- is a 50% or even 33% refund rate considerd high by your standards as a vendor?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Don&#039;t forget it&#039;s the refund rate out of all your orders, so I&#039;d say above 15% and I ask to FE. But I don&#039;t sell any $10,000 products. Out of 4,000+ transactions we asked only 5-10 times to FE. Most buyers stats are good/new buyers with no stats. <br /><br />Just try to keep your stats good and you won&#039;t face too much problems if any with most vendors. Remember to Finalize in time cause BTC rate isn&#039;t stable at all... :)

				FE is definitely fine for your first small purchases with trusted sellers.&nbsp; There is NEVER a reason to FE if you have more than 10 transactions or a long-standing relationship with the vendor.&nbsp; FEing on a 10k purchase is absolute bananas and I would never recommend something like that regardless of what the vendor says.
