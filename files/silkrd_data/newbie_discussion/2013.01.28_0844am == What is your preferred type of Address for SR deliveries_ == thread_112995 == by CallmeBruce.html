				Hi all,<br />I&#039;ve been trawling the posts trying to select the best way to give my address out. I am curious as to which method people prefer. Looking at the posts I have seen people recommending<br /><br />1. Fake name with home address<br />2. Real name with friends address<br />3. Fake name with friends address<br />4. Real name with PO box<br />5. Fake name with PO box<br />6. Other<br /><br />What have you guys/gals been doing? Any advice appreciated.

				Anything that doesn&#039;t look suspicious. So real name for somebody that has already received plenty of mail at that address. PO boxes are a bad idea in my opinion, if&nbsp; you have to enter a federally funded building to pick up your stuff, it just doesn&#039;t seem safe to me.<br /><br />Of course, everyone has their opinions on this matter. Just try not to raise any suspicion.

				I usually go with the &#039;hide in plain sight approach&#039; and use real everything. Whether the package has your name on it or not there is the same plausible deniability if it gets intercepted. Think about it, what is to stop anyone from sending one of their enemies an envelope addressed to them with drugs clearly smeared all over it? I feel that the more normal your mail seems then the more likely it is to get delivered. You will not likely be questioned about any suspicious packages but if shit ever hits the fan deny anything when it comes to soliciting or receiving said packages.<br /><br />Also if you have a package that must be signed for (unavoidable in some cases), many types of apartments have front desk personnel that will sign for all deliveries since they sort the mail themselves and put it in your box or have you pick it up from the front office. These are ideal places to get things delivered as a controlled delivery would be much more difficult for LE to execute, and your signature is never on anything.<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert! But that&#039;s my two cents.

				Thanks for the advice. I like the &quot;hide in plain site&quot; idea. Its like an old Dr. Who episode with Tom Baker. Where he askes K-9 <br />q: where is the best place to hide a tree<br />a: in a forest.
