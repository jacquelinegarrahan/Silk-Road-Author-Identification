				So KingOfClubs totally screwed me!!! I ordered a fake ny id and over and over again told him I needed it to pass in ny. He had a great rating overall so I figured fuck it. So I liked the pictures he sent so much of the first one I ordered 2 more! The first 2 shipped and he started ignoring me before I got them. I finally got the package today after missing saturdays delivery (wasn&#039;t there to sign for it). IT IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF SHIT I&#039;VE EVER SEEN! NOT ONLY IS THE LINE THROUGH MY FACE VISIBLE THAT HE PROMISED WAS NOT BUT THE FEEL IS SO FUCKING OFF IT IS NOT EVEN FUNNY. THIS ID WOULD NOT FOOL MY 8 YEAR OLD NEPHEW AND I AM DEAD SERIOUS IN SAYING THAT!!!<br /><br />I finalized it once I knew the postman tried to deliver but now I have 2 more ordered!! Worst part I already rated him 5/5 on feedback score for the first one!! Can I go back and change my feedback after I finalized?? I am obviously going to dispute the second and third ones. If anyone reading this is thinking about a fake id DO NOT GO THROUGH KINGOFCLUBS TRUST ME I AM SAYING IT TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU!!<br /><br />These were my first few purchases on this site and I really thought I had the solution after getting scammed (reallygoodfakes.com robbed me $400!) I really liked the system of the escrow and everything and thought I was protected. I thought I had finally found a place with good honest people not going to lie or fuck me! Boy was I wrong!!!! I understand I am a little piece of shit on this site with no standing and he is a big time seller who the moderators are going to obv trust more. What would you guys do????

				Hey Man. <br /><br />Sorry to hear that :&#039;( Message the Vendor say they did not pass ask for a Refund. You never know he might give you a refund. Also if it says on his advertisement that these Ny Id&#039;s will pass. Message him saying did not pass. And leave what ever Feedback you think is necessary.<br /><br />Good Luck. Hope you get it sorted <br />

				With the new feedback system in place you cannot go back and edit your review. However you can use the vendor discussion area if messaging him does not result in an good resolution. Hopefully you and the vendor can reach some sort of resolution. <br /><br />Since you have already finalized, I don&#039;t think that the official SR Resolution Center is an option. I would approach the vendor as politely as possible since they are you&#039;re only hope of getting some money or a reship since you&#039;ve already finalized. Especially if this vendor is well known and has a lot of good reviews, one dissatisfied customer in the discussion section isn&#039;t really going to hurt his/her reputation. So basically you need to hope that s/he&#039;s willing to work something out with you.<br /><br />You probably don&#039;t need to be told this now but for others in this thread, in the future, you really should not finalize until you&#039;ve seen the product for yourself. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Good luck with getting it sorted. Feedback on the quality of fake ID&#039;s is not so great for most vendors.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t think that many of them have the technology to produce a good fake these days not that holograms and chips are usually in place.<br /><br />Fake documents would be a much better bet.<br /><br />Sucks that you got ripped off... persist with the vendor and see if you can get a % as a refund.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Glad i didn&#039;t order from him. Next time get an out of state id so there is less scrutiny. Good luck with sorting this issue out

				Yes i agree, your best bet is trying to get a conversation going and ask for refund or replacement.
