				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible.&nbsp; Accounts with a 0 btc balance that haven&#039;t been used for a specified amount of time are eventually archived.

				I think I was told 3-4 months when someone was having a go at DPR how long info is stored on the database but the mods will know better than me.. if scout isnt sure then neither am I.. If you really want to keep it save . 0.1btc in there and if you want to delete it spend all your balance then it doesnt really matter.. change your password and forget the account ever existed. <br /><br />I have an account from a couple years back, I think I spent all the money cuz I got it to do just one order of 2cb powder back when BTC was Â£4 a coin. I cant remember the pin or password anymore but the account was dougstanhope haha anyone feel free to have a go at guessing that shit. im assuming there was no money left in but imagine the smallest amount in it would be worth a ton now..

				This has nothing to do with thread but I just wanted to let you know that I really like your name WingWong. And also it would be awesome if for your avatar you had a picture of Butters from the tv show South Park when he was wearing oriental clothing with chopsticks in his mouth from the City Wok vs City Sushi episode.
