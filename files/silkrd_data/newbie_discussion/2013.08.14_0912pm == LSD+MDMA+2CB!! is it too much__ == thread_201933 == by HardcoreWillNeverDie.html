				I have been wondering lately:<br /><br />if LSD synergizes with MDMA and MDMA synergizes with 2CB, can they all three synergize together???<br /><br />so I have tried twice candyflipping and it was pure magic!!! totally loved it))<br /><br />I know people take MDMA and 1h - 1,5h later 2CB and its also great!!! the MDMA come-down is then not so bad or hardly to be felt<br /><br />how would it be to take LSD, 3-4h later MDMA and then 1h-1,5h later 2CB? <br /><br />too dangerous and dead afterwards???<br /><br />My question is about synergy mostly<br /><br />can all three substances be combined together when two of them are combined with each other on a very good way: <br />LSD + MDMA = GOOD<br />MDMA + 2CB = GOOD<br /><br />peace and love

				No idea about 2CB, but throw DMT and/or Salvia in the mix with LSD&amp;MDMA and you&#039;re in for a treat! :D<br /><br />OOOOOOOOOOSH

				Dunno about &quot;too dangerous and dead afterwards&quot; but I&#039;d say at best it would be a waste of precious drugs and at worst, a possible fucking nightmare of a high.<br />If you have quality acid, you&#039;ll be rolling like on MDMA and hallucinating like on a huge dose of MDA. Anything on top of good acid--whether MDMA, Salvia or DMT is just wasted overkill and possibly a total fucking mind explosion. <br />Now IF you&#039;re taking blotter that purports to be acid but is really 25i-NBOMe HCL...then yeah, fuckin&#039; mix away (as long as you KNOW how much of the NBOMe you can handle on its own.<br /><br />But REAL, strong LSD...like a fine scotch: either alone...or with just a drop of water ;)<br />Stay safe.

				I would take the 2CB out of the mix. It could potentially cause nasty cardiovascular effects in combination with MDMA. you&#039;re better off playing it safe, enjoying the drugs individually for what they are IMO.

				Sounds like a typical night for me, the lsd and mdma together is great then take the 2cb just after the mdma comedown for some amazing euphoria and visuals backed by the lsd bonus points for nitrous.

				It will not kill you but if it takes a chance at ruining your high then why do it? If you&#039;re a lucky enough individual to have good LSD and good MDMA then don&#039;t taint it.<br /><br />I&#039;d take other&#039;s recommendations and use another drug such as DMT in order to reach the multiverse while candyflipping.
