				Is it just me or is anyone else finding their orders in &quot;processing&quot; for days and vendors not responding to PMs in acceptable time frame? Even vendors I have dealt with multiple times taking forever to get buys shipped recently and PMs going for days unanswered. This seems to be a recent thing but it&#039;s happening with all 6 orders I placed in the last 2 days. Some vendors don&#039;t respond to PM at all, others taking 36-48 hours to answer. <br />I know SR was intermittent a day or so ago but it was up much longer than it was down as I was logged in much of that day so that&#039;s no excuse. if established vendors are getting smug about their success they should be careful, there are lots of people looking to take their business. <br />Is it just me or is anyone else having the same issue?

				I think its summer, so everything is running slow.&nbsp; Most buyers are outside with vendors following suite.&nbsp; I know that we keep some orders in the queue for a few days, ours is a mom and pop establishment and we can only do so much.&nbsp; We do try and keep up on communication though.<br /><br />I would hold out for your vendor, they are probably busy packaging orders or soaking up the sun.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

Your response makes perfect sense though I do wonder about any vendors who live in places like SoCal where it may as well be summer all year long. It&#039;s probably like you said or maybe just a untimely coincidence that all my orders recently have taken forever to get processed or PMs responded to. Your response has reminded me that I should look at the glass as half full instead of getting my shorts in a knot. Thanks!
