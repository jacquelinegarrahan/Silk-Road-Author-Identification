				Congrats for getting clean!<br /><br />My worst experience is nowhere near as bad as yours, but one time I took too much acid, smoked too much weed, and spent the majority of the trip thinking I was in hospital. When I awoke, it turns out I had passed out face down on the lawn. &quot;Friends&quot; of mine decided to pick me up and spin me around as well as throw things at me because &quot;it was funny&quot;.<br /><br />Needless to say, they&#039;re no longer invited to when my friends and I all do drugs.

				Thcaddict, congrats on getting clean off of dope.<br /><br />My worst was one night doing a bunch of real mescaline back in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; I was hanging outside with a neighbor that was not doing anything. As I was tripping hard this guy reaches towards his face and says take my eyes. Looking at him I see two skeleton hands holding eyeballs. Must have ran 1/2 mile before I calmed down.<br />Peace&nbsp;
