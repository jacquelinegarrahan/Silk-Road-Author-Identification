				Well yeah true. I was thinking more in the sense of...something to do. Like opiates. They make me happy, give me feelings, pass the time - increase my standards of happiness. I can safely say that food does the same thing (as well as keep me alive).

				I remember reading that most wheat (white bread) has chemicals in them that are very similar to opiates, and you actually experience small withdrawal symptoms if you stop eating bread.<br /><br />So yes, food influences your brain chemistry which influences everything else therefore drugs.

				Speaking of special cookies... Way back in the way, someone I knew made special brownies, went into school early and put them in the teacher&#039;s lounge. The teachers ate them up, and the day was much more interesting.&nbsp; ::) The cool part is, most of the teachers knew that they were high, but they just kept on teaching. (This was the type of school that had cigarette burns on the toilet seats, desks, lunch tables.)

				Just about all food effects you in some way. Just like drugs.<br /><br />Food makes you feel happy or sad. It can give you energy or make you tired. Some crave it to the point of addiction. Some are good for you while others aren&#039;t . Some food can even cure (or cause) disease. <br /><br />Sounds a lot like a drug. <br />

				Food alters your mind state in that it effects the productivity of it.<br /><br />Should you eat shit processed food you wouldn&#039;t retain any nutritional necessities and your body wouldn&#039;t work as efficiently. Your brain is also a muscle and its efficiency would lack somewhat should you not feed it properly.<br /><br />Food for thought.

				Pretty much everything that crosses the blood brain barrier is a drug if I&#039;m not mistaken. There are plenty of things in food that come under this category. Heck, you can eat dried opium poppy pods for their fiber and get high off of their morphine content.

				Yes. <br />A great deal of compulsive eaters and overweight people are not eating out of hunger nor&nbsp; cravings or nutritional need. They are actually eating to make the brain release a dose of&nbsp; it&#039;s natural &quot;chemical rewards&quot; , similar to endorphins and such. They are eating to get&nbsp; a chemical fix from their mind&#039;s pleasure center.<br />That&#039;s part of the reason it&#039;s hard to lose weight naturally.<br />When food companies advertise food on TV, if you watch carefully, you&#039;ll notice that they always associate food - with sex, love, well-being, comfort, joy ect.&nbsp; and your mind has been&nbsp; so absolutely saturated by those messages that&nbsp; an apple will not release the chemical &quot;feelgood&quot; like the way a Cool Ranch Dorrito chip will. <br /><br />Also you could say that&nbsp; theres many alkaloids in all plants and vegtibles, most we have no idea how they affect the human mind/body.
