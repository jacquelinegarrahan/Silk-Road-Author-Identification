				Used to be Bitiinstant for me too.&nbsp; Just now finding out that you have to have a &quot;Real&quot; identity.&nbsp; After multiple attempts, I sent Bitinstant Support an email asking what the deal was and why did I keep getting error messages (either &quot;Problem with vendor&quot; or &quot;Cannot verify your identity&quot;).&nbsp; &nbsp; Needless to say I&#039;m hunting for alternatives or a workaround.&nbsp; On the other hand, I&#039;m wondering if it it really is no big deal to give them your identity?&nbsp; After all, it&#039;s not illegal to buy btc. <br /><br />Here&#039;s their reply:<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Hi -------,<br /><br />This error is provided when there&#039;s an issue confirming your identity&nbsp; Please make sure that you are providing accurate information when you initiate a transaction.&nbsp; We verify that your full name (so make sure it isn&#039;t a nickname) is linked to both your birthday and physical address.&nbsp; If these items don&#039;&#039;t match, we will be unable to confirm your identity and you won&#039;t have access to account creation.&nbsp; Some users have reported that they had success with a past address if they have moved recently.<br /><br />If you believe that you have provided accurate information in these fields, please provide for me the following information and I can escalate you account to the third-party provider who verifies out IDs.<br /><br />Full Name<br />DOB<br />Street Address, City, State, ZIP<br />email address<br /><br />If you respond to this ticket with this information I&#039;ll assign your case to our ID Support and contact you when we have a resolution.&nbsp; I apologize for the inconvenience.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Marcie B<br />Director of Operations<br /><br />****************************

				*your<br /><br />To answer the question, I buy BTC via Coinbase, but that (buying) is linked directly to one&#039;s personal bank account.<br />To answer the question, this time with a different set of words - I don&#039;t purchase BTC these days. Haven&#039;t in a while.

				Perhaps I&#039;m just lucky but if you establish a relationship with a coin vendor it&#039;s doubtful they&#039;re going to try and fuck with you and even then you can still stay anonymous. One of the other worries I&#039;ve heard of is if they ask why you&#039;re buying coins.. they don&#039;t care. <br /><br />As to why they are more expensive is because the vendors set the prices. Also the fee&#039;s in the system probably raise prices up as well.. It isn&#039;t terribly significant though. One of the other pro&#039;s is there are no limits on what you can purchase. People will gladly sell you 1000&#039;s in coins (I would consider localbitcoins escrow the larger the amount gets). Unless you want to verify an account with bitinstant you&#039;re stuck to 500 per store. Sure buying bitcoins are legal but I&#039;d prefer to keep that separate from my identity.
