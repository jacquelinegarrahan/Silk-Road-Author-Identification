				I am new at SilkRoad but not 2 fresh...&nbsp; I mean i search and look up and down through SR now for more then a month and by now i learn preaty much about what to look when you search for trustworthy vendor and where too look for signs of a scam.. With this part i didn&#039;t have much problems to learn how people doing things on SK ,,Some are honest , some are so called &#039;&#039;selective scamers&#039;&#039; or selective honest people :) and there are also people who are absolutley scamers and main reason behind there accounts are to scam people from their money... <br />These are things that i know about SR , but from the beginning i got the biggest problem buyer could face and that is if buyer have absolutley no idea how to get things from silkroad to his/her home... I know i sopose to have some wallet on my PC (some kind of software) but don&#039;t know what to do with this.. I also have a problem with this PGP masseges (encryptic masseges) and everything that follows afterworts... I think u got a picture where is the problem ... My question to anybody is; Is there any manual or something for helping people out who are true begginers at all of this Bitcoin situation... I know my English is broken so please don&#039;t go there.. :)&nbsp; I thank to anyone who&#039;a going to respond to my problem ....&nbsp;
