				Title: <strong>Placebo Effect on SR</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I see several listings where a fair percentage of the buyers are complaining about bunk material while others exclaim that it&#039;s the best dish they&#039;ve ever licked.<br />Taking into account the placebo effect, and given that 39% of taken placebo ends in an expected effect (especially pain related effects - aka opiates) I&#039;m highly skeptical of these listings. I know a few people who&#039;ve even taken bunk acid and had a trip.<br />I&#039;m fairly certain that most people are getting the same product. I doubt that these dealers have a stash of bunk and a stash of live-lead and play eenie-meenie everytime they send a shipment.<br />What do you guys think? Is it possible for a seller to put a purely bunk product up and get the 39% 5.0 because of the placebo effect? Think they scammers might even be betting on it?<br />It&#039;s almost my nature to see a few bunk claims and a few &quot;amazing stuff&quot; claims and give the seller the benefit of the doubt. However, statistically - we should be thinking about the placebo effect and consider that it&#039;s all bunk, the amazing stuff is just amazing because of placebo.<br />

				I think you&#039;re spot on. I buy a lot of hash and when I was first starting out I went by the feedback and was consistently disappointed. Admittedly I do have high standards but why shouldn&#039;t I when I&#039;m paying $12-20 per gram?<br /><br />There&#039;s more than 1 hash vendor with pages and pages of outstanding feedback on hash that when I bought it would go straight in the bin, adulterated unsmokable rubbish, but so many people had said it&#039;s amazing etc in the feedback. Now I look at the content of the feedback rather than the amount of it. Using these forums helps too but there&#039;s not much hash discussion. Photos are important for hash and weed buyers too but I&#039;ve seen pics blatantly taken from google images before, not so much here but a lot on Atlantis.<br /><br />Once you find the honest sellers you tend to stick with them only venturing elsewhere when you need a change and can afford to take the loss.

				Also I guess a lot of buyers here are relatively inexperienced, either people who wouldn&#039;t normally buy drugs due to having to deel with dealers or, lets face it - teenagers. Naturally these people wouldn&#039;t know how to judge quality drugs.

				Oh right thanks for the completely unsolicited off-topic advice. You&#039;re assuming (because you&#039;re an arrogant know-it-all) that I don&#039;t grow my own weed and make my own bubble hash and oil. Well I do, don&#039;t need to buy it like you, and it&#039;s great but I prefer some really high quality import hash for smoking during the day. I am oldshool.

				Ya, I&#039;ve not dabbed, but it&#039;s something I would definitely consider trying at some point.<br />I smoke rarely as it is though, so I wouldn&#039;t want to put my self on the floor.<br />But yeah - back to the topic, I&#039;d agree. It seems a lot of people gravitate toward a &quot;main&quot; seller. And I&#039;m sure this is the reason.

				People also stick with their &#039;main&#039; vendors because they then make themselves known to&nbsp; the dealers, they&#039;re much more likely to get fully refunded if something actually DOES go missing in the post etc. Not to mention that customer loyalty will inevitably get rewarded.<br /><br />I believe the majority of dealers do have better drugs than you&#039;d normally find on the street.&nbsp; But, you&#039;re probably more likely to find the odd complaint on products like benzodiazepines or opiates, especially among people who&#039;ve never taken these classes of drugs before or are starting to develop tolerance, as they might find themselves underwhelmed by&nbsp; even the purest of these (or in the case of benzos, may not actually &#039;feel&#039; the high)

				I can definitely see that. I mean, likewise, I hope to find a key group of sellers I can trust and stick with. Not that the other sellers are bunk - I&#039;m sure most are legit. I&#039;m just saying - when you see that ratio of complaints, at least for me, it raises a red flag. You have to wonder if it&#039;s bunk. However, that probably wouldn&#039;t stop me from at least trying it out - if not just to see if it really is legitimate candy. :)
