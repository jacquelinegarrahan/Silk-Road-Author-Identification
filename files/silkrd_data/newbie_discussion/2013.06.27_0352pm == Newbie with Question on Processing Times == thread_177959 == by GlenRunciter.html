				Hi...new around here and learning to become patient with &quot;processing&quot; time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it just me, or do vendors drag their feet with new guys and wait 72 hours before updating status of package to &quot;in transit&quot; ??&nbsp; &nbsp;This wait time is killing me, and I don&#039;t really understand why it takes 3 days before any movement happens.&nbsp; &nbsp;Especially on domestic US orders.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this is normal, that&#039;s fine and&nbsp; I will learn to adjust my lead time...but I see a lot of vendors advertise 24/Hour turnaround time, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s not happening with my orders.&nbsp; &nbsp;So is this typical with new buyers like me....or am I just choosing lame vendors?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or is 72 hours a typical, average waiting period at SR for something to be &quot;processing?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you so much for any feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;Appreciate it.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s tough to be patient but that&#039;s how it is. Assuming you picked a good vendor and the vendor&#039;s page doesn&#039;t say s/he is on vacation etc you should be fine. Some vendors if you read their page they ship only Monday and Wednesday or things like that. So right build yourself up a bit of a stash so that you&#039;re not needing to be overly worried about a few extra days processing. I&#039;ve had orders go into shipped within a couple hours, sometimes it takes a few days. I think some vendors even if they actually ship it the day you ordered it wait until the next day to mark it in transit.

				It depends on the vendor you use also but most of the time it takes a day or so.

				My goal is 1 business day processing time, so you just have to pick better sellers unfortunately.
