				So, considering this interesting post isn&#039;t drowned by all the spam infected shit in this worthless &quot;newbie discussion thread&quot; (sorry I can&#039;t post this in the real section).<br /><br />I&#039;ll start by saying I&#039;ve been walking on the road for years (only 2 but whatever that&#039;s still years). I have only used the forums for reading (haven&#039;t had to otherwise).<br /><br />I may or mayn&#039;t notice that the road is currently down. (Actually hold on let me double check just in case *clicks another tab*)...Yup, it&#039;s dead.<br /><br />Checked all the alternate urls DPR has<br /><br />After further reading through the forums, I have come to this conclusion.<br /><br />The DEA may/may not be making vendor accounts...selling mass shit for mass cheap... and waiting for people to make BULK buys; ESPECIALLY/exclusively if it&#039;s a specific area they are targeting, including miscellaneous crack hoods of all kinds; They then bust the fuck outta them. They continue to do this with same account, or make new ones. (probably already been going on the whole time).<br /><br />It is then plausible that they will use SUCH abnormally large busts of narcotics to blame SR, and credit themselves for taking down SR, further claiming that they&#039;re the geniuses who busted the whole operation. (Hell, DPR could be them for all we know.) Probably not DPR rakes in the cash either way. But listen, there&#039;s a fine line between naivety and paranoia.<br /><br />I heard recently that the largest pill bust ever in this one specific area where I DONT live has happened, interestingly enough it coincides with the recent attempted bitcoin wallet seizures by the DEA.<br /><br />Someone post this shit in the real forums if you&#039;re a mod. Also if you&#039;re a mod..fuck this newbie section. Thank you.&nbsp; <br /><br />WATCH THE MOVIE &quot;A SCANNER DARKLY&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				There&#039;s actually a discussion somewhere else in the forum going on about a vendor selling sheets of LSD for $300 &amp; this possibility has come up. Nothing I&#039;ve seen other than the cheap prices to raise flags though.

				When you&#039;re on the dark side of the law, anything that isn&#039;t the norm is gonna create ripples. Doesn&#039;t matter if its legit or not. <br /><br />So if you really are paranoid - just do what the crowd does. Safety in numbers, really.

				Don&#039;t think they would go to them lengths, although of course they deal, pervert the course of justice. And do whatever they need to get a conviction.<br />But how are they going to&nbsp; explain that to a judge?<br />Yes your honour, we sold the accused copious amounts of LSD, and then we pounced. now I have seen dateline NBC and I know entrapment when I see it. In UK that&#039;s what it is entrapment, and your always going to get a not guilty. But the DEA are a law unto themselves.

				So because you couldn&#039;t sign in for 20 minutes, you determined that the DEA is selling drugs on SR? Have I got that right?

				You guys are probably right<br /><br />I read the &quot;Have we got our first DEA honeypot&quot; thread.<br /><br />Then read the &quot;Bitcoins seizure due to be acquired through controlled substances act&quot; thread.<br /><br />All while coming down on 25i.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to bed now.<br />

Funny and true.<br /><br />@ OP if you had been around for two years you&#039;d know that SR underwent several episodes of forced inactivity. You&#039;d know to chill if this happens and that it eventually SR resumes service after some time. You&#039;d know that DPR communicates about it, and where to look up those communications. You&#039;d know not to spread FUD about it, even though, yes LE is watching us now. <br /><br />And it&#039;s up.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Jason<br />

				I know a guy who knows about SR from people other than me and he has tried to tell me the same retarded garbage.&nbsp; Youre trying to tell me that US LE has offices in multiple European countries that operate accounts on the SR and&nbsp; package drugs to send out pretty much all over the world?&nbsp; Dude these vendors have to put in a lot of time to keep this shit rolling, all of the ones i go to are teams of people.&nbsp; One person simply couldnt keep up.&nbsp; There would have to be so many resources put into what you propose, it seems a very inefficient method for busting people.
