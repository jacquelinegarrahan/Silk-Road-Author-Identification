				Your subject line may answer everything: &quot;Trouble with BitInstant&quot;... <br /><br />Read some of the complaints in the forums about this topic... Search &quot;Bitinstant&quot;.. and patiently wait for a *possible delivery&nbsp; ??? <br /><br />Sorry Man *Patience is virtue* in this one. <br />Good Luck :)

				Interestingly I have had no issues with them. A week or so ago it did take like 2.5 hours for my coins to be deposited in my wallet, and after reading the forums started freaking, since it has always taken less then an hour. But I always do lose out with the exchange rate, and that is fucked! But then again the $5 left on SR is now worth $30, I only wish I had left more ;-)<br /><br />mushmold&nbsp;
