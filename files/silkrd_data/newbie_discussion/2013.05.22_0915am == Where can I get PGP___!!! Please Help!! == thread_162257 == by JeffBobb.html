				Ok, I just got done researching PGP as best I could.&nbsp; And there&#039;s TONS OF SHIT about PGP, OPEN&nbsp; PGP, GNUGP, - I have no idea where to start.&nbsp; I see that Symantec now owns PGP and they charge well over $100 for the version.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked up OpenPGP which is supposed to be the freeware version - I think - and I get a bunch of mirror sites that no longer work.&nbsp; Can anyone provide me with 1 or more links where I can FINALLY download this damn thing with out so much hassle???&nbsp; Much appreciated, Folks.&nbsp;

				Assuming you&#039;re on Windows, you should get Gpg4win. During installation, you should select to install GPA. It&#039;s fully possible to use Kleopatra (I use it because GPA crashes a lot for me), but GPA is much more convenient.

				I&#039;m surprised you&#039;ve fully researched yet still have difficulty...<br /><br />There are numerous dedicated threads on the subject on these very forums, so have a good read here.<br /><br />It&#039;s not terribly complex...are you familiar with encryption and terminal use?...if not, get up to speed...<br /><br />Cheers and good luck<br /><br />Doc

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162257.msg1153747#msg1153747">Quote from: JeffBobb on May 22, 2013, 09:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is GPA??&nbsp; And what is Kleopatra?? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They&#039;re both applications that do essentially the same thing, being key/certificate managers. GPA is an abbreviation of Gnu Privacy Assistant, and is the &quot;official&quot; graphical user interface for GnuPG.<br /><br />Basically, (once again, assuming you&#039;re on Windows), you download GPG4Win (gpg4win.org [please use your regular browser to navigate here]), it will be a pretty straight-forward installation but GPA isn&#039;t selected to be installed by default. Kleopatra is, however. You can run the install again afterwards if you didn&#039;t select GPA the first time, and install GPA if you want at a later point.<br /><br />When you open either of the programs, it will ask you to create a key. For your anonymity&#039;s sake, don&#039;t use your real name or an email that can be linked to your identity.<br />&nbsp;<br />Use a passphrase you can remember, though because if people want to message you with encrypted messages you will have to input your passphrase to decrypt them.<br /><br />Now that your key has been made, you can export your certificate/key by right clicking it and select to export. It will ask you to save a file, and you can open that file in a text editor to get your public key. This one is safe to share with others, and it&#039;s what others will use to encrypt messages that only you can read later. Never ever share your secret key.<br /><br />If you wish to encrypt a message to someone else, you&#039;ll have to have their public key. Save their public key as a file on your harddrive, and import it in GPA/Kleopatra. You can&#039;t use other people&#039;s public keys to decrypt anything.<br /><br />This is the big difference between GPA and Kleopatra, in my opinion; You can easily make an encrypted message for someone else by going to GPA&#039;s clipboard and write your message, then select to encrypt using the recipient&#039;s public key that you have saved. It&#039;ll tell you that you can&#039;t decrypt it after you have encrypted it, just as a reminder (not that you don&#039;t know what it says anyway). Then it will output the encrypted message that you can give to them. <br />They will then decrypt that message using their private key and passphrase.<br /><br />In Kleopatra, you&#039;ll have to create a file with your message, a regular txt file is fine. Then you&#039;ll have to go to File -&gt; Sign/Encrypt Files -&gt; select your file containing the message -&gt; Encypt, and make sure the Text output (ASCII armor) checkbox is checked -&gt; add the recipient&#039;s public key that you&#039;ve saved -&gt; Encrypt. <br />It will then output a file named the same as your file, and .asc at the end. You can open this file in a text editor and copy the contents to send to the person you encrypted the message for.<br /><br />When other people want to encrypt a message to you, they&#039;ll need to do the same steps with your public key. When you receive it, you will have to use your passphrase to decode it. It&#039;s pretty simple, actually! Try posting your public key in the Newbie PGP Club and have a quick conversation with someone, in private!<br /><br />I hope this quick guide will help you take the first few steps. :)
