				I placed an order with this vendor yesterday afternoon and the comms up until passing on my UKash code were very good. Since this point I have heard nothing, messages ignored, no BTC&#039;s and I&#039;m starting to get a little concerned. Hopefully my fears will be allayed today and he&#039;s having connection problems.<br /><br />I will be sure to update here and on other threads, whatever happens.<br /><br />Tick tock....

I have messaged you now, I got the code off you at 6pm last night, so no i havent been ignoring you.<br />i do have to sleep you know, but thanks for your excellant review anyway ;)<br />As it states on the front page all orders are being completed asap, had terrible time getting on tor past few days. It seems nice and smooth on SR now though :)<br />I have a load of Btc&nbsp; arriving from my bank account today to cover my orders, so either way, all orders completed today. Remember vendors can normaly have up to 4 days until their order is late so remember this is still a fast service.<br />Litecoin, macdknife which is your order if you have one?<br /><br />Kind Regards <br />BitcoinBillionaires

				Appreciate SR can be a mare at times but as this the first time we&#039;ve done business I&#039;m sure you can appreciate a certain degree of twitchyness.<br />Not pointing the finger just aware that it&#039;s a jungle out there and trust has to be built.<br /><br />Look forward to spreading the love when the coins arrive.&nbsp; ;)
