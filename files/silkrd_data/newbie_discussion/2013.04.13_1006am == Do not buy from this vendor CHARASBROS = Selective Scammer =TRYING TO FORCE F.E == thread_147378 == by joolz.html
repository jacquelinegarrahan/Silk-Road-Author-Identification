				No they don&#039;t really give a shit about this. Sorry. They make a lot more money from him than from<br />You. Sorry.&nbsp; Who do you think they will stand by?<br /><br />By really,&nbsp; I just paid an FE for the first time ever during the crash.&nbsp; I don&#039;t blame vendors either. When your price of drugs is cut in half because silk roads calculation is too slow to keep up to trading.&nbsp; This is a technical error and not a malicious attack from a vendor. <br /><br />&nbsp; He was trying to protect his money from giving you half your order for free.&nbsp; Now, imagine you are him and you have 16 orders coming in at the same time, all during the crash.&nbsp; He is bankrupt and out of business. He now owes his supplier twice the money all of a sudden.&nbsp; Legs will be broken. <br /><br />You accuse him is scamming you ?&nbsp; He tried to save his business from bankruptcy ass. <br /><br />He gave yu the chance to TAKE HALF THE RESPONSIBILITY for the market swing for placing an orer during the crash.&nbsp; You could&#039;ve taken it with an explaination.&nbsp; <br /><br />So . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell everyone here why you decided to place your order all of a sudden during the crash?&nbsp; Did you try to exploit the situation and get free drugs at the cost of your vendor?&nbsp; And then accuse him of trying to steal?<br /><br />Who is the thief. ?

				I&#039;m not a vendor , but I&#039;m very thankful for my trusted precious vendors.&nbsp; They all honored my orders during th crash, when they could have just let it ride for a few days in processing instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />You should consider shopping from better vendors who known the coin market a little better.&nbsp; Not sure why anyone thought it was a good idea to cash out during the crash.&nbsp; Dumb.&nbsp; Just a wait a few days and your money is back up in value again.&nbsp; Easy as that.&nbsp; Fuck. Just wait a few days for the big traders to complete those big trades and then the market settles down again.&nbsp; &nbsp; Why is this crash so different.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sorry for being so harsh.&nbsp; I applologise. Sorry. <br /><br />I meant to really say,&nbsp; Don&#039;t hold your breath with SR support. They start with the biggest issues first and work their way down if they have any time for it.&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendors here get away with FE ing for months before they step in and shut the con man down.&nbsp; They give many chances to vendors before shutting them down. Sometimes hundreds of people are genuinely scammed before they will shut it down. It&#039;s buyer beware here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stick with large reputable vendors and squeeze your order in quietly so it just blends in with the other orders they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t stand out or something will go wrong.&nbsp; They can make things complicated for yu and discourage you from ordering from there again.&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to be careful with your words.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a mafia in here to some degree.&nbsp;

				Sounds like this vendor doesn&#039;t have a lot of operating capital to work with.&nbsp; Maybe his allowance has run out from mommy and daddy?
