				Hallo!<br />I can&#039;t publish in a topic of the seller, because I newbie on forum, therefore I publish here<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?PHPSESSID=qkh6gfbtd1j6plngu661pasqa2&amp;topic=24610.840<br /><br />I have a problem with a product of seller Tyl3r Durden(100) &quot;Tyler tabs 1200 µg 25i-NBOMe x100&quot; which I bought in December 2012.<br />Link - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ee1e2b5d9d<br /><br />I used that papers one piece for time. The first several times it were magnificent psychodelic effect! And almost no any side effects.<br />But the last times, two months ago, month and yesterday - effect was worse and worse. :-(<br />I have only strong poisoning, and small psychodelic effect. Strong nausea, vomiting, headache proceed starts at one hour after reception and about 12 hours last after.&nbsp; It very much isn&#039;t pleasant. :-( :-( :-(<br />Why so ???

				And sick too. General system poisoning.<br />I don&#039;t understand why at first times such wasn&#039;t. Maybe drug deteriorated, maybe it is impossible so long to store it? Or toxins collected in my organism.<br />Excuse me for bad English.

				I&#039;ve got about 7 trips under my belt at this point with 25i nBOMe and I&#039;ve enjoyed every one so far. I&#039;ll certianly report back if my trips start becoming uncomfortable like yours.

				Well you&#039;re not doing anything extreme. I personally have never had a hit past a couple weeks old, so I can&#039;t be too sure if it&#039;s the time, or the tab, because I also have not tried Tyler&#039;s 25i (Even though I really want to)<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a minimum 2mg of 25i a day for about a week to study myself. I noticed there was a tolerance build up, but other than that, I never experienced any symptoms like you.<br /><br />Have you tried fresh hits or just stayed away from the stuff all together?

				The problem we have with nBOMe&#039;s is, as a Research Chemical, little to no unbiased scientific research has been done surrounding their effects and after-effects. Although my best guess would lie between 2 options;<br /><br />1. Your tabs &#039;went bad&#039;.<br />2. The drug doesn&#039;t agree with you.<br /><br />Of course, it may be a mixture of the two - or something completely unrelated.<br />If I were you I would message the vendor and explain your experience - he/she may have more knowledge of the substance, or may even know somebody who has had a similar experience to you.<br /><br />My advice for now would be: don&#039;t take any more, contact the vendor and research around the likes of Erowid/Bluelight. (Clearnet).

				Oh friend I wish I could decipher your English lol<br /><br />Heracles there might have the best idea. Not much is known about these drugs.<br /><br />Contact Tyler, explain your situation.<br /><br />Read his reviews, see if anyone else has shared your symptoms.<br /><br />And just stay away from it. Try some LSD if you haven&#039;t already

				Thank you for answers, guys!&nbsp; :D<br />LSD it was never bad affection to me, except easy problems with digestion. But LSD is more expensive.&nbsp; :(<br />Besides, probably not everything that is on sale - pure LSD. For example, 300mg LSD from seller juergen2001 (96). It strongly and quickly hit, but it have light side effects which aren&#039;t characteristic for LSD: intoxication, joint pains, skin reddening.<br /><br />You don&#039;t know who sells the purest LSD?&nbsp; :o

				I was thinking of starting a new post, but after reading this, I&#039;m wondering if I should bother. I just received Tyl3r&#039;s listing of &quot;5 25i +5 25c-NBOMe&quot; caps. The 25i are Red and the 25c are blue. I was looking forward to trying one or the other, but no where in the listing is the dosage... are they 300ug, 600ug, 1200ug? I asked Tyl3r but no reply as of yet.<br /><br />Anybody here know? What can I expect from the 25i / 25c? I&#039;d prefer to start with a low dose. I&#039;m more interested in the visuals and body buzz than the mind fcuk. I&#039;ve done that plenty with LSD back in the day. I&#039;ve toed the edge of reality and I prefer it just fine on this side of it. <br /><br />What about mixing the 25i / 25c with MDMA? I got some of juergan&#039;s sweet licorice smelling tan sitting around too!
