				Sorry bout caps, put this in another thread and decided to make it a topic...<br /><br />IF ANYONE CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM, PLEASE INPUT EVERYTIME DMT IS TRIED, THERE ISN&#039;T MUCH OF ANYTHING FELT, FEELINGS OF A LIGHT HIGH AND A BIT TRIPPY EVEN AFTER HITTING 50MG WITH LIGHTER 2&quot; FROM DMT IN BOWL. ALSO, WHEN USING K VIA INSUFFLATING RAILS FIRST, THEN I.Ming (NOT SURE IF I DISSOLVED CRYSTALS RIGHT, USED GOOGLE STILL TO NO AVAIL) ONLY FELT WAS SOME CRAPPY ACID-LIKE EFFECTS AND A BIT OF A NITROUS FEELING.<br /><br />USUALLY SUBOXONE AT THE LEAST IS BEING COMBINED.<br />Thank in advance!

				Dude if your DMT trips suck I wonder what dying is going to be like for you...<br /><br />Just kidding. Are you smoking it straight out of a pipe or with an herb? Is it a meth pipe or a weed pipe?

				Sounds like you got bad quality goods.<br /><br />I have had DMT from silk road that didn&#039;t do much.&nbsp; What did yours look like? The stuff that was weak for me looked like a brown powder.<br /><br />The good stuff should look like this.&nbsp; More of a shard then a powder.<br /><br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=16167<br /><br />As for the K, I would guess it was cut.

				damnnnn yeah it was a brown powder, it was n,n tho. my girl just snaggd sum diff stuff off a 5-mEo guy so hopefully that will yield better results????<br /><br />and K was in crystals all the times there. how are the crystals supposed to be dissolved? the ration was prob wrong but it rly didnt wanna dissolve. they didn&#039;t use a scaley. like 250mg into 20cc, was weird, tried cookin and not cooking. when cookin only for a lil, what is the proper way for the K (didnt mean to rhyme hahah)
