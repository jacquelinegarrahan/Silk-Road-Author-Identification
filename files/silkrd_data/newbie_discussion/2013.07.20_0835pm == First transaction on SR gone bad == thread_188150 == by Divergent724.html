				There was a guy with a very similar name causing a massive stink recently. Just doing a search for &quot;PPLLUURR&quot; returns all kinds of scam warnings... is this a new account of his, or what?

				After doing searches i learned that &#039;PLURRRR&#039; is a scammer. There was some sort of correlation in the thread that i read with &#039;Cartel Del Note&#039; being a selective scammer aswell. Lost a good amount of money - Nothing i can do after FE&#039;ing correct?

				- Nothing i can do after FE&#039;ing correct?<br /><br />Sorry man, once outside of escrow, your on your own, fuck all SR can help you with. Learn the very harsh &#039;never FE&#039; lesson &amp; move on. If you are new, it&#039;s maybe wise to make a few small purchases first, rather than get stroked as you did, on a &#039;big order&#039;.<br /><br />Peace.

				Exactly what the guy above me said. Once your money is out of escrow and gone to the vendor, there&#039;s nothing you can do. On the upside of things though, it looks as though his vendor account has been deleted, as I did a search for him and nothing came up. Sorry for your loss dude. I&#039;ve been scammed in the past, and it isn&#039;t nice. They&#039;ll get what they deserve in the end.

It&#039;s the nature of this place unfortunately.
