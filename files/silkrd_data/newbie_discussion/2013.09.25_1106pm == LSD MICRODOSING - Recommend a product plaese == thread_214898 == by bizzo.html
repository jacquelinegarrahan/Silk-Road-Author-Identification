				Hi! Hehe..<br />I am not an avid user of anything but I&#039;ve tried this and that (been pothead, tried coke, xtc, shrooms, tried trying dmt...). Haven&#039;t done LSD.<br /><br />So, I am interested in micro-dosing acid. If you are not familiar with the idea just google it. Briefly, you take 10-20ug everyday (0.1-0.2 shrooms) as a booster of sorts / nootropic / mood enhancer, making you feel perfect for the day without being high / tripping or anything. Check http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-266623-p-8.html - ctrl+f look up &quot;Madeline&quot;. That story was particularly inspiring.<br />I came to this idea on my own, but it turns out it&#039;s a practice that gains traction. I was initially interested only in shrooms micro-dosing, but then moved on to LSD for convenience reasons mainly, but also read that psylocibin tolerance is somewhat easy to build up. Anyway. Most likely I am going to switch back and forth from acid to shrooms. <br /><br />So, since I am completely new to LSD, I am totally lost in trying to determine what would be the best way to do precise 5ug doses. Is the acid evenly spread on the paper? What about the microdots, could you dissolve them in water? Any other suitable products available here?<br /><br />Side question, today I went to a smartshop in Holland and bought a 15gr pack of Mexicana truffles (if I lived IN Holland, I would not be even considering acid, got checked by the popo&#039;s on the way back in the bus, lucky.), took like half a gram, had a wonderful day, perfect mood (I am having serious issues with grumpiness let&#039;s say) - this shit works! but I am not sure what would be the best way to store the truffles long term, since I am going to be taking just .5gr a day? Googled a bunch, nothing in particular... The thing is I don&#039;t have a freezer, just a fridge...<br /><br /><br />

				Not many people actually know the content in ug of even their own tabs, so I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have much luck making exact 5ug doses. Maybe just use trial and error to find a good dose? It would probably be easiest to just cut blotter up finely, but if that isn&#039;t enough I guess you could try soaking it in distilled water and drinking some, or if you can buy liquid LSD you could dilute a drop in distilled water. Remember chlorine in tap water will destroy it.

				Soak the tab in a small bottle of vodka for a while, then measure out portions of the vodka. Some will stay in the tab but most will go into solution easily.

Additionally, I believe LSD causes a short term tolerance, requiring three times the amount to achieve the same effect the following day (but correct me if I&#039;m wrong).<br /><br />Perhaps Tess could enlighten us?<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				OK, that&#039;s an interesting point indeed. I&#039;ve read that these sub threshold doses (LSD) do not build up tolerance...<br />?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m considering buying some dots from Cher. But they do not know if I could dissolve them in vodka. I guess it would be even easier then blotter, esp. if you crush the dot first, but could somebody please confirm this?<br />

				I have been microdosing the past week. I took Tessellated&#039;s blotter, and would cut off a tiny amount daily, hard to say how much, but maybe 1/10 - 1/20<br /><br />Definitely noticed increased mood and energy.<br /><br />I would love to test Cher&#039;s microdots, they are very intriguing. ;)<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of great LSD on SR.

				Nice!!<br /><br />What bothers me with eating peaces of blotters is that I suspect that the acid is not evenly distributed... Vodka method sounds good. 120ug + 60ml vodka in a syringe - easy.<br />I&#039;m not really into consuming dissolved ink though :) That&#039;s why I would love to get a definite answer for the microdots. No idea what they are made from really and if it&#039;s going to dissolve in vodka? I would say of course, since they are made for consumption anyway, but still...<br /><br />I would be on that shit for months, 3 to 5 days of the week, even 7 days a week in the beginning, so why I want to be able to precisely measure everything, is so I could determine if I am building tolerance, determine right dosing, etc.&nbsp;

				The 110ug labtested tabs from Kittenhuffer are imho the easiest to microdose with bar custom made dropper vials like mahakala did. Its pretty easy to slice them in 10 even pieces for ~11ug slivers with a x-acto or stanley knife and they are very evenly dosed. Here is his profile http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f6371738b0 and at 6 cents per microgram you cant really go wrong.

				I&#039;ve read that nootropic LSD doses are in the 10-15ug range, but that&#039;s so small of a dose that there are a lot of variables, mainly your personal sensitivity to LSD. I know guys that are good on 50ug, but I can barely feel a 50ug dose.<br /><br />The idea that microdosing doesn&#039;t contribute to tolerance is a very intriguing idea, I wouldn&#039;t have believed it if I hadn&#039;t read so many first hand accounts. I want to try it myself, but if I was going to really do that I would have to get a vial or some microdots. (JerseyCow has decent prices on dots, but I don&#039;t know how soluble they would be in small amounts of alcohol
