				Do no trust this Vendor. I repeat, Do Not Trust This Vendor. They have ongoing issues with missing orders or packages. Just enough not to arise suspicion. However, If you examine their buyer feedback area; Every page will have at least one claim of a package or order not arriving. These missing orders goes well beyond July. A trend I haven&#039;t seen on any other vendor on SR. Quality of product and stealth of shipping methods maybe called into question, but none with soo many missing packages.<br /><br />Most buyers say they received a PM from the vendor about the issue, but then nothing more and no package arrives. I received a beautiful worded PM that tried to convince me they had documented the issue, gave me a bonus for my trouble, and sent out my packaged. I almost hit finalize, but I thought better and hit resolution. I extend the due date to the arrival day the vendor claimed was &quot;safe&quot;.<br /><br />Still no package.&nbsp; Now DreamMension claimed yet another shipping error on their end and it would be arriving the following week.<br />I sent them a PM in return saying I wasn&#039;t interested in them re-send it out, and to simply refund my money. I asked for a 100% refund after paying for the vendor&#039;s more expensive &quot;safe&quot; shipping method.<br /><br />They disregarded everything I, the customer, said and did not refund my money. I&#039;m now tied up in another week plus waiting for a package that likely won&#039;t come. My advice, STAY AWAY from this Vendor or ANY Vendor with missing packages in their feedback. Just not worth it...
