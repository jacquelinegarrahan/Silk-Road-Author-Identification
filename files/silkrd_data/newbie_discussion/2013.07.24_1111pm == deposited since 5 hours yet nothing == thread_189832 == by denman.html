				hi I did a deposit 5 hours ago, now i went to bitcoinchain.info to check conformation and it says <br />&quot;No transactions found for this address, it has probably not been used on the network yet.&quot;<br /><br />note:I changed my old address 2 hours before i made the deposit, the deposit was made to the new address

				Try running the address through blockchain.info instead and see if any transactions show up. I dont think you were scammed, it&#039;s probably only delayed because you changed your address.

				Would have thought that you&#039;d have some confirmations by now, have you double checked that you&#039;ve entered your new deposit address correctly?
