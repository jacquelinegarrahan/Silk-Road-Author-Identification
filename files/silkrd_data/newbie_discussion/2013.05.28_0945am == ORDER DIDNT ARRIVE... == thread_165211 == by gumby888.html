Please read the following entries in the SR Wiki:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Escrow<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I.27ve_already_finalized_my_order.2C_but_am_having_problems.<br /><br />The escrow system is there for your protection. Finalising an order - by its very definition - is a statement that you have received it and it is exactly as advertised / you are 100% satisfied with it. Never FE. There is nothing that can be done in the event that something goes wrong once you leave the safety of the escrow system.<br /><br />Libertas

				Hey Gumby who is the vendor that scammed you? As the vendor name you gave is not a vendor.....did you give the wrong name? The only good that can come out of this is yet another example of why you should NEVER FE. If you are a newbie and you are getting ready to place an order and then vendor asks you to FE..go somewhere else.<br /><br />And since you are new...before you order...send the vendor introducing yourself and explaining you are brand new and that you read their vendor profile and you read the listing and that you understand everything and that you will finalize the minute you receive the package. As 99% of vendors are hesitant to vend to newbies because new buyers tend to no finalize right away. And in general are a pain in the ass. But EVERYONE is new at some point. And if you are proactive and you message the vendor first and you did indeed read their profile and you do understand everything you will raise your chances DRAMATICALLY in getting the vendor to do business with you.<br /><br />I cant stress how important it is for you to read the vendor profile and the listings that you plan on buying. I can not tell you how many people do not read my listing for the drug they purchased! It is incredible to me that they can place an order and not read the listing. But they do. And sure enough they miss my minimum&nbsp; and every time they say &quot;I didn&#039;t read your listing&quot; And every time I berate them for not doing so. Because I want them to get it in there head that they need to do things the right way on here.<br /><br />And so many newbies act really stupid. Yes non newbies do too. And even saying newbies is stupid to me..but I just mean people that are new to Silk Road. They spend all this time in the forums trying to figure out btc...I think that is the hardest thing to do...then they get it and are so anxious to use it, that they then hurry and make mistakes. And those mistakes can be costly. And I do not want to see anyone get ripped. And the truth is it should never happen. Just follow the advice SR gives you and you will be great. And the biggest one is DO NOT FE. IF you do...there is a chance you will have this same post :( and that will make you &gt;:(<br /><br />Please read everything the vendor has to say and follow the instructions. They wrote all of that for YOU. And if you do and you choose a great vendor then you will have an awesome&nbsp; experience on the Road. Do not go with a brand new vendor that is not proven, go with a proven vendor with great feedback and stats. It only improves your chances of having a perfect experience. Not that using a new vendor is bad. In fact it could be good for you to establish a relationship with someone new too. Just under NO CIRCUMSTANCES FE. NONE. And then using a new vendor is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Good luck and sorry OP. Get there real name please. Lets try and get to the bottom of this!

				I have also heard that some vendors will see youre a newbie and then say they have sent out the package and never do, because we are newbs and we dont know, in detail the things that go on. but i hope there love for drugs is better than that and they wanna keep doing business with everyone

				Find vendors who wont make you FE. NEVER FE. There is usually someone you can order from who will not require FE..Be careful no matter..I was a noob and lost 1btc my very first transaction..Vendor had 100% perfect feedback, recent as of a few days before order, responded to msgs, politely and quickly..and asked since he/she was supposedly going to express mail and I was a noob&nbsp; for me to FE..vendor went so far as to continue to play along and msg that package was delivered and on and on..then nothing...about a month later I get a msg from the vendor saying, oh my account was hacked, I have reported this to SR and will be closing this account..he proceeded to say on his vendor page his account had been hacked and the feedback from myself and 2 or 3 others was NOT true..um..it was true. THAT really kinda pissed me off..he did close the account, it looked like he sold a prescription he had and then closed it.. <br />What I learned? Dont FE. Try to deal with vendors who have recent feedback for the item you are ordering, or at least have a decent track record..and still be cautious and check everything you can, forums, feedback, etc. I had one order that was overnight shipping and took a week to arrive because the vendor seemed to keep having personal disasters..what actually was going on was he didnt have the item he had sold me until monday, when I bought it the tuesday night prior..and he was moronic enough to tell me that thru msgs, and then had the nerve to say he told me he would come thru..yea..uh I paid overnight, told the jerk withdrawals would be on the way for me if it wasnt here, and I had allowed til Friday for myself..and it finally shows on tuesday? Had I not gone with another option I would have sat in withdrawals for 3 days...which I have to say is not something you can reimburse for..I would have ordered from someone who HAD the item had I known...<br />Be cynical and leery...but there are plenty of vendors who do what they&nbsp; say...and their feedback shows it..
