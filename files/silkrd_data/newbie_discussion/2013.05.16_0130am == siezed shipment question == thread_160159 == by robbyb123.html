				im still hoping my item will arrive, but i accidentally ordered international and the package is still not here. i have gotten no mail in 2 days. i also have a large express package coming. my question is, if package #1 was seized and had a minute quality of a low profile but schedual 1 substance, will this affect my mail/other package in anyway? has anybody ever experienced a govt placed mail hold?

				How long since you have ordered said item?<br /><br />95% of people posting &quot;help, were my drugs seized?&quot; threads often report back saying &quot;YaY my package just arrived, I was worried for nothing&quot;.<br /><br />So I&#039;d just give it a little more time. And try to share as little info about your location as you can :)

				oh yes ofcoarse, im trying to keep it all secret. but honestly its a trusted vendor and estimated at 5/6 days, been 10. its such a small amount, leftover scrap coins from other purchases. so it was shipped but im 90% sure its not seized but IF it was, would this affect the other express package? the express is all domestic. i dont care about the potentially seized one, i do care about the one that should be coming domestically.

				I see. Did you finalize the small international order? Or is the money in escrow?<br /><br />It might or might not affect your domestic order. Probably by the time they will determine for sure that there are drugs in your international order, your domestic order would have came through. See what happens. And keep us updated ^_^

				So just to clarify, we&#039;re saying hypothetically that an international package containing a schedule 1 substance sent to your address gets seized? And you&#039;re worried about the second package?<br /><br />It&#039;s unlikely that the second package would be affected by this. If you get put on any list it&#039;s probably too late as that other package will be at your doorstep shortly. But I&#039;m just wondering why you&#039;re not more worried about the schedule 1 substance getting sent to your address being seized by customs.

				money is still in escrow but i will most likely release regardless of arrival because seller did his job. and im not worried because its not my address and 99% of the time customs just sends a letter stating they have an item siezed. this hypothetical package is highly unlikely to be able to be detected by dogs also. so im just paranoid, first international order and from a sketchy country none the less. ill keep everybody updated, so people know in the future, im sure all will be fine, but i cant find any experiences with multiple packages.
