				If your having trouble sleeping after smoking H, then your not doing enough to quell your bodies addiction. <br /><br />I feel obligated to advise against taking benzos before bed, after smoking/snorting/banging H, as there will always be a possibility you may not wake up.

				You do understand hes talking about 10mg valium after a night of smoking HEROIN, correct? Mind you, heroin is one of the single most neurotoxic drugs that a person will do, right? <br /><br />Please you seem to be so sure of what it is you think you know, explain to me what exactly makes you sooo sure, that he will be ok? really, i want a legit answer as to how your so convinced this is safe, for a total stranger mind you, one of whom you have never seen, to do?

Too many, and its not like i dont have a life, friends, family and more importantly, bills to pay.<br /><br />&nbsp;This isnt some online role playing game dude, this is people health and safety here.

				listen m8,your the only one who knows what your body can take and what is gonna be dangerous to you.<br />As for not sleeping well after using H,lots of my fellow users get this and a 10 mg tamazie or valium does help a lot.personally I can take around 60 mg of each and a £30 hit but like I say,you know what you can handle.Dont push the envelope.Know your limits and stick to them.If you can get them,Zopiclone are good for a nights kip although for the 1st week or so taking them nightly,you get a strong metallic taste in your mouth but that will go in a couple of weeks.<br />Be careful!!

				I&#039;d like to share a story I remembered now I read this thread, xanax bars was what made me remember... <br />Years ago, a girl I used to know had been partying all night with a few friends including our coke dealer at the time. This guy had good coke but with us friends he shared an awesome stuff (which I never saw again since) which was light brown cristal, the color almost like mdma, but white when you turned it into powder. Best I&#039;ve ever had it was... but I digress...<br /><br />Anyway thing is after the night she wanted to sleep, and couldn&#039;t, so a friend gave her a xanax bar, she never had it before, so everyone said yea, with this you&#039;ll sleep for sure. Well, a few hours later they had to take her to hospital, I dont know exactly what happened but her lips were totally blue, she wouldnt wake up, well what bizcuit said about a mild coma, I think this was something similar... <br /><br />I know she recovered in a few hours, and she was ok, but we all thought, what if she had been alone? <br /><br />You just have to be very careful when trying and mixing new substances for you, get information and go bit by bit. <br /><br />Of course I also know people with tolerance will be able to take tons of stuff and survive, I used to work with a&nbsp; guy who took like 4 or 6 xanax with alcohol every day, and get his H when he could, or methadone when he couldnt. But he had been an addict for years, and he could even get (some) work done in that state.<br /><br />So, just be careful and learn to know how different stuff affects _your_ body!<br /><br />

				I would not recommend this&nbsp; - as this is one of the major coffin nailer combos out there.... I actually am pretty sure I tried some H that was cut with a sedative once... as there was a much &quot;sleepier&quot; nod that hit rather quickly....and a much smaller quantity was needed to achieve this nod...I also think I had become slightly addicted to this other substance as I had used it for a few weeks straight and noticed when I stopped doing this batch that subs did basically nothing to help the Wds...I had some really strange powerful withdrawal effects that I never experienced before (or since) off of any opiate...and before you say - it was just great gear...I never had an issue with subs helping wds...even with some good china white...(real china white that is - not the common SR everything is china white crap)
