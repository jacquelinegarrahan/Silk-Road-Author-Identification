				hey, try not to talk about packaging on here cause its sketchy, but it can come in either, some people put it in bubble envelopes and some use full sized boxes, it wont come in a huge box, it will be a nice discreet package with a return address to some random store, but trust me, i was paranoid like you until my order arrived, now i understand. PM for more details, always happy to help out someone in need.<br /><br />my last pack job was in a box the size of a small tablet, inside of the box there was a bubble envelope, and inside of that there was completely sealed off product covered in industrial grade plastic, not this crappy food grade stuff
