				Alot of guides on the net say that you&#039;re alot less likely to be targeted by a controlled delivery if you&#039;re only ordering personal amounts of weed. In my state having an ounce or more is a more serious crime than below. Would it make a difference if I ordered a half ounce instead of a full ounce? Obviously I&#039;d like to order more for a slight discount and not having to order as often. Thanks.

				I consider 5-15 grams normal for personal use. above 25g and it seems a bit much. 100g is suspicious, but if you reach a kilogram I know you got something planned.<br /><br />But I ain&#039;t the police.

				Anything over a half ounce would be considered &quot;intent to sell&quot;&nbsp; but if you get caught sending or receiving anything in the mail, there is a felony just for using the mail system to ship drugs.

				when i do smoke weed&nbsp; generally&nbsp; &nbsp; i&#039;ll smoke 1.5-2 a day<br />people always bum tho&nbsp; so it gets a bit more pricey than that<br /><br />ounce would usually last aprox 10-12 days. which i think is reasonable amount of time between picking up<br /><br />thats when i&#039;m not living with other pot smokers<br />then it&#039;d make more sense to buy QPs<br /><br />thats practicality though<br />legally&nbsp; where i live i think 28grams +&nbsp; is considered for trafficking purposes <br /><br />

				any thing under 4oz should be considered personal.&nbsp; unfortunately what I think doesn&#039;t make any difference legally.
