				i have been on the silk road quite a bit and have noticed that all the vendors have numbers in parentheses next to their names and i would like to know what these numbers say about the vendors. Please reply to this if you have the answer.

				each feedback has a max of 5 points<br />the parenthesis indicates the venvdors&#039; scores<br />If a new vendor has 10 feedback the max point is 50<br />but then he turned out to be a douche and only gets 20 points<br />20/50= .4 =40% and thus he will have a 40 in the parenthesis&nbsp; <br />

				oh, i see, thank you for helping me with that. One time, i ordered heroin, i finalized early, and this guy Frank Matthews sent me shit that was no good. I didn&#039;t use pgp at the time to send my address and so i was wondering if that might have an affect on the person not sending me the stuff i ordered. Do vendors ever treat customers poorly if they do not use pgp?

Its really for your protection, not the vendors, so please for the love of everything learn to use PGP. Its so easy, only adds 30 seconds on to buying stuff, and it covers your ass. <br /><br />Also, never FE, just dont. Plenty of other vendors out there that dont require you to FE. Escrow is there for a reason, and no one can help you get your money back once you FE.

He was sending out suspect &quot;MDMA&quot; a while back as well. Did you ever message him about it? You are well within your rights to do so, you know.
