				It is about 5 BTC for a sellers account and you can upgrade to one under your account page. <br /><br />The 5 BTC is used as a bond and you get it back once you have succesfully traded a certain amount.

				You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community. To be eligible for a refund, you must have completed at least 30 transactions totaling $1,500 or more and have been a vendor for at least 6 weeks.

				There are a plethora of criteria you will need to meet. As above&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; you need your deposit, then you need to think about your shipping, packaging, You need a constant supply of your chosen drug/s. You need to be versed in stealth, assume you will be hit with lots of orders. Can you keep up? You&#039;ll be surprised how many customers/buyers on on here. Oh and you need to learn PGP, as you will be putting your punters at risk any other way. There are tons of threads explaining this and a couple of good members who will be willing assist you, PrincessHigh...Astor...JacknHoff.....Razorspyne, to name but a few. good luck.<br />

				Also be well versed in how you are going to get your money out cleanly.<br /><br /><br />The more secure your computer the better eg things like running a virtual machine on a hidden disk to access SR is a nice way to gain peace of mind. It also allows you to fully encrypt and hide and re-hide files so you can actually do book keeping safely :)<br /><br />B
