				I went to my mailbox today and found 2 packages from the same vendor. Confused, I opened both of them and discovered that they must have accidentally mailed me the same order twice. Not sure if it were an oversight or might have been high when packaging. Either way I&#039;m never one to judge. So in the end I got double for what I paid for. I released the escrow and gave an outstanding rating but my conscious is picking at me.<br /><br />My question is, should I be honest and give them the extra money or go away as a happy individual with extra free product? What would you do in this situation? All replies are welcomed.

				Crap, its probably mine, something was expected today but didn&#039;t show&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />I think I would message them and let them know, I would imagine most vendors would be grateful as it will prevent a ton of headaches going through a resolution process for whoever didn&#039;t get theirs, they certainly would not want it mailed back, most would probably write it off as a loss, or maybe try and work out a deal on your next order.&nbsp; After all they took your order in good faith without getting paid up front.&nbsp; And don&#039;t forget, they have your address (although most smart ones get rid of mailing info right after sending), but do you want to bet on that&nbsp; :P

All replies are welcomed.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s how you see the road.&nbsp; If you see it as a community of like minded individuals bond together by a love of freedom, you should notify the vendor immediately.<br /><br />If you see as a place to score drugs, fuck em.

				I say keep quiet unless he asks you. In that case, be honest. No you don&#039;t have to pay him anymore money, either way.<br /><br />Maybe buy a lottery ticket too :)

				You should most definitely let him know. If anything, tell him what transpired and see where he goes from there. It&#039;s not like he is going to ask you to mail it back but if he asks for some compensation i do believe that that is fair. This is where true integrity comes in. Do you mind telling us what the order was?<br /><br />I try to do the right thing in any given situation with any given variables.

				I&#039;d let him know too.<br />I like to think SR is a great, loving community, and that if someone had the choice to do the right thing for me, he would, so i should do the same<br />

				Thank you everyone for the advice. After thinking about it I will go ahead and compensate them for the extras. SR is a loving community and I wanna do my part to keep it that way. Even though we all stumble upon buyers and sellers who are greedy pricks, but with everyone&#039;s help on the forums we keep them at bay. The only issue is that it may take me a week to give them the money but I&#039;ll go ahead and advise them of their error. This is sort of like one of the after school specials where we all learn a lesson through honesty and keep the good karma flowing. Much love to you all :)

				Well jees, don&#039;t go overboard, if anything just let them know you got two (hell thank them for it, maybe it they were in a giving mood), let them ask for it if they want.

				No need to pay the money unless he asks. I&#039;d guess that if you were nice enough to just let the vendor know, he&#039;d probably just let you keep it for free.
