				So, gonna be hitting a uk festival soon,and I&#039;d rather have my own stash than run the roulette of buying inside.&nbsp; Now, I know how to beat a human search: unscrew the back of a portable speaker, put inside, then replace the cover.&nbsp; But the dog element is the one that worries me.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on using both heat seal bags and MBB bags, and keeping sure everything is as clean as god knows what. Is that enough to keep the pooches at bay? I really, really don&#039;t wanna get caught. However, I also want drugs.&nbsp; You see my problem.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				acid is probably the easiest thing to hide but the hardest to preserve. I like the method of in between the pages of something like a book since that would keep it from heat, oxygen, and light i believe. Or how about some mega dosed hits under a stamp or two on an envelope?? Shit, dose the stamp underneath!

				Some festivals confiscate speakers-I&#039;d be wary of relying on that. <br /><br />I would&#039;ve thought/I&#039;m hoping that keeping the product MBB sealed straight from the vendor should cover it.&nbsp;

				Also, stims wise, what do people reckon is the safest drug to get in? I really want to take coke, but I&#039;m sketchy as it&#039;s a drug even crappy festival sniffers would be trained to find.&nbsp; Would MCAT be a safer bet?&nbsp;

				one time my meth guy had his sack in his um.. prison pocket.. and we were stuck in his truck just us. Only place to do this. He pulled it out and opened it. I was careful not to let the dope touch the outside of the bag but come on man really?! The whole truck smelled like a diaper. I was like &quot;you expect that to go up my nose seriously?! ha , your crazy man&quot; 15 seconds later up up and away! <br />just trying to get my 50 without spamming :)

				You said you know how to beat a personal check, so are you referring to wanting to know how to beat a vehicle check?&nbsp; Imo, going to festivals and concerts they will have several personnel doing the actual physical security.&nbsp; Just watch others go through ahead of you to see what the patterns of each personnel might be.&nbsp; Hide accordingly.<br /><br />I find that rolling things up right in your underwear/boxer&#039;s elastic then strapping your belt/jeans right over top gets me through every time. Just empty pockets and have your hands up when you walk up, they don&#039;t even touch me.&nbsp; <br />

				If you can MBB it, that&#039;s best for the smell. Make sure you do it away from where you smoke/etc. As for hiding it, depends on what level of security there is. If there are pat-downs/etc, you will have to stick it between your cheeks :)<br /><br /><br />The best thing you can do for yourself is to look less suspicious than everyone else. Who do you think is more likely to get a close inspection - someone wearing a bob marley shirt with dreadlocks or a clean shaven person with a normally fitting plain t-shirt?

				make sure you double wrap it or something if you do the girl or anal methods as the bioavailabilty of most things with that method of administration is quite high and you could risk overdose or even death if the container breaks or leaks, especially with uppers...

				Wow so either things are rough for UK concert goers these days or things are worse here in the US and I just don&#039;t realize. When I used to hit the festival / concert scene (bit of an older fart now) all I ever did was roll some up, put&nbsp; in a pack of cigarettes after carefully removing the cellophane and act like it was an unopened pack and never got any flack. I would think (and hope) if the festival promoters really wanted to keep their business going they wouldn&#039;t have dogs their since half their customer base at least smokes I&#039;m sure. I&#039;ve never seen dogs at any concert or festival in the US, but I know things aren&#039;t the same as the other side of the pond.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I should prob point out that I have a caution for possession, so getting caught really isn&#039;t an option.&nbsp; Likewise, I don&#039;t want to risk my neck buying stuff from fuckers I don&#039;t know, and I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m paying for expensive booze.&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda thinking of a handful of pills, and a g of either coke or MCAT.&nbsp; I do consider sniffers to be my biggest risk here.&nbsp; How tried and tested is heat foil and MBB bags.&nbsp; Assuming I did 2-3 layers of foil, then 2-3 MBB bags, washing everything with smirnoff so I&#039;m all squeaky clean, what are the chances a dog will nab me?&nbsp;

				if you have the resources and are willing to go through the trouble, one thing I&#039;ve hear that works vs dogs is:<br />well you know those flameless candles? IE a bunch of hot liquid wax in a cup. Put drugs into waterproof/ HEAT PROOF bag/container A. Wash the shit out of container A, like leave it under the faucet. this will show you if you have a leak (might ruin your drugs so be careful). Dip container A into wax, and let wax harden. Place whole thing in container B. (preferably also airtight container. Then hide said object.

If they were ok with a gram they probably wouldn&#039;t sweat 3 or 4 but still that&#039;s bs. I got into the rave scene in the US for a bit and that was crazy shit. So many deals going down everywhere, LE would literally walk around with a camera just trying to get you on film then through you in jail.

				Hey man! I had the same problem at a festival not to long ago and decided not to chance it.<br />I was absolutely gutted to find that the security is alot more laid back than you think (and&nbsp; that the festival make it out to be).. and yes they did have dogs.<br />After speaking to some people in there the best option is double wrap whatever it&nbsp; is in cling film/vacuum baggy and stick it in the sun cream ;) or if your thinking md stick it in a soft drink and pour into seperate bottles when your in there.<br />Good luck :D
