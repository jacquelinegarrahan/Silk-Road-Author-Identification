				As I&#039;ve/we&#039;ve been judged unworthy to continue the conversation in the original thread i thought I&#039;d start this up in case anyone wanted to continue updating on if they&#039;ve got their orders etc.

				Its daft. That thread is a prime example of why this new post count rule can only work in the favor of dodgy vendors. 70% of posters on that topic and are now unable to update their delivery status. <br /><br />Good idea for starting here. Lets hope everyone can find it..

				I did attempt to edit one of my posts in the original thread so that people would know where to come, but i wasn&#039;t even allowed to do that...<br /><br />As you said, especially annoying as all those who had to FE are no longer able to comment because of their newbie status. <br />.

				I&#039;ve just spent the past 10 minutes on the old thread wondering why I couldn&#039;t post a reply... Ohwell!<br /><br />I actually, surprisingly, received what I ordered off of him today, which is relieving. I&#039;m not entirely sure why it took over a week for the items to get here, but the fact that they&#039;ve turned up eventually is reassuring to say the least.<br /><br />I hope everyone else manages to get some sort of a result. :)

				Good to hear! My previous transactions have all been good with him but not used of late, as found better gear for less from the eu. But pleased to hear he is back up and running and fulfilling orders.

				So hears a turn up for the books i also got something today, haven&#039;t checked it yet as i want (in the unluckiest of circumstances) time for the plod to come a knocking before i go ahead.<br /><br />It seems all this shit might well just have been terrible timing for an unlucky well established high volume seller.<br /><br />Lets hope we never end up with this many noobs and vets sitting on the edge of a quiet Silk Road worrying, about nothing, again. <br /><br />Good luck chaps i hope all yours come through.
