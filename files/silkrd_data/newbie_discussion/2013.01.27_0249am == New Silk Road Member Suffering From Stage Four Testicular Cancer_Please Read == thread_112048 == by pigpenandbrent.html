				I wasn&#039;t implying that you were a scammer - I simply urged people to be cautious whenever threads like this pop up.<br /><br />That said, I hope others have more suggestions for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s very possible that even if you live in a conservative state there are still some groups in existence in your area that might be able to help you get access to some medical marijuana.&nbsp; You can also definitely buy from SR, it&#039;s just that if you are strapped for cash, it might be more affordable through one of those compassionate care groups.

				weed should help with the appetite issue - at least a little.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t have cancer (or i did, but not requiring chemo or radiation) but there was a point where medical issues had totally destroyed my appetite as well.&nbsp; the medicines, in particular, always made that aspect worse.&nbsp; marijuana helped -- sometimes probably too well because i would often end up eating junk foods rather than real foods.<br /><br />anyway, i recommend trying it, and tweetb&#039;s reputation as well as the $22 price tag make it a nice place to start!

				yes, medical marijuana in states where it&#039;s legal is exactly for that, helping keep food down, cause weed often gives people the munchies and helps with nausea. the turkey tail mushrooms is more of a long term thing where you drink some tea every day and helps boost the immune system

				Look, you sound like a previous scammer who came here and tried the same story.&nbsp; People donated to him and then he admitted he didn&#039;t have cancer and was just scamming people.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you have to understand why we are all being cautious, and why we are quick to jump to that conclusion.<br /><br />Further, I don&#039;t understand how you don&#039;t have $22, but you are able to afford internet.
