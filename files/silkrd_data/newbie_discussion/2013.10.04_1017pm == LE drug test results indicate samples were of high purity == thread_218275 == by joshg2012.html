				I just finished the complaint and am glad to know that prior purchases I&#039;ve made were not adulterated. I&#039;m not sure whether to believe the complaints; a few things seem odd. I thought FBI agents were never allowed to disclose their identities to the public for one, but besides that, the government has revealed some guidelines for security best practices. For a market where individuals stand to make millions if not billions of dollars there will be individuals who will gladly take over the market, perhaps not as principled as DPR.<br />One other thing, Ulbricht had been confronted by authorities in July but was arrested in September, according to the complaint. Shouldn&#039;t he have immediately deployed contingency plans, like move SR to another server and flee the US? At any rate, here are some guidelines I&#039;ve learned from the complaint.<br />1.Always create a different username/password for every account<br />2.Never trust a US-based company with communication needs<br />3.Always use PGP, in fact, possibly require PGP.<br />4.Require stringent password rules.<br />5.Set up phishing filter mechanisms, with perhaps, a primary password, a user-chosen picture, and the requirement of a second password.<br />6.Do not post links or quotes as a signature to your identity.<br />7.Immediately deploy contigencies if authorities confront you.<br />8.Use servers in countries with strong privacy protections.<br />9.Obfuscate with the use of dopplegangers (ok maybe I&#039;m getting too Hollywood with this rule)<br /><br />Some of these would have prevented a blackmail scenario.&nbsp; Others could have prevented identity detection.<br /><br />I also noticed how many subpoenas were issued during the investigation. It seems like the FBI has easy access to IP logs of gmail and comcast, my guess through the abuse of the constitution. The government&#039;s war on America will fail until radical changes are made to the drug laws, the criminal justice system (I&#039;ve seen LE plant evidence firsthand, do I have any respect for that), and our medical system, especially the psychiatric system. And for the rest of the world who used Silkroad.&nbsp; I apologize on behalf of our government. <br /><br />
