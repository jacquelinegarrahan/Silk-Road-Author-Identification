				I placed an order a little more thank a week ago, I am waiting on 6g&#039;s of his wax to come my way...You just need to be patient.&nbsp; With the btc crash, tormail, being hacked and this jaggoff ddos attacker, there is a lot going on. theDankbank is a new vendor and trying to get used to the system as I&#039;m a new buyer, I know there was a lot of uncertainty. I think he will make it right with all of us, lets cut him a little break.

				Hello EVERYONE <br />I AM THE BANKER<br />first and foremost i&#039;d like to thank everyone for even discussing TDB whether you opinion is positive or negative i RESPECT IT all the same.<br />&nbsp;i just wanted to stop by and let people know that despite our 100% positive reviews <br />we have not been as perfect as we would like to be. We have not gotten every order out on time, nor have we responded to all of our messages within a 10 hour time frame. We have let people down with respect to shipping times, and for that I am DEEPLY sorry.<br /><br />I&#039;m not here to win public adulation, not here to win a popularity contest. <br />NO... the only reason I risk my freedom by being a vendor on SR is because I want to share Love, i want to give Love, and i want to receive Love<br /><br />TDB has not been around long enough to gain the respect that other vendors have EARNED <br />BUT we want to be #1<br />and we WILL EARN THAT TITLE<br />you will see that there will be NO ONE who gets ripped <br />and ANYONE who feels like they didnt get there moneys worth Will get taken care of you have my WORD<br /><br />Our prices are some of the most compassionate around and they will continue to be so.<br />We will only get better!!!!! Don&#039;t take my word for it ONLY TIME WILL TELL<br />Until then i WELCOME all opinions because i dont take it personal i use it as constructive criticism <br />so with that being said <br /><br />KEEP IT COMING <br /><br /><br />p.s. if i wasnt robbed at gun point last week I wouldnt have let you DOWN<br />God bess

				Yea this OP sounds like an impatient buyer that just got fed up with the wait, DB doesnt make you FE, so whats the problem here im confused ...... Just got part of my order from DB this week and the SD wax is really really good def some of the most tasty Ive had to date. Im glad he/she decided to chime in and say something finally. Just tighten things up a lil bit DB and your gonna be at the top of the every ones list in no time.&nbsp;
