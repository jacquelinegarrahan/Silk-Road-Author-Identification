				As we all have come to find out the hard way. Members with under 50 posts must stay within the newbie area. The reasoning (spammers) is completely understandable, yet the solution may be somewhat flawed. We are a new vendor on SR and have been welcomed with open arms within our own thread in the &#039;Rumor Mill&#039; area of the forums. A WONDERFUL SR start indeed, until 2 days ago. How is it possible to have an 11 page ongoing review thread that you are no longer allowed to reply within? to answer questions, give updates etc? We were actually in the middle of a FREE giveaway that has been going great; now we are not even able to announce a winner IN OUR OWN REVIEW THREAD. Once again, we completely understand the reasoning but this is not a great resolution. Although we are all &#039;noobs&#039; we should not be held within a single area of the forums. A forum is for interaction, feedback, experiences, advice etc. Many of the SR advice and experience can not be obtained by a section full of everyone in the same position as one another. Members with over 50 posts definitely are not going to even think about coming and interacting in the newbie area (why would they?), so essentially we are all forced to be spammers in order to eliminate spammers? This resolution does indeed negate the overwhelming spam post but it is at the expense of everyone else essentially. Personally we are pretty bummed and WE DONT WANT TO POST ABOUT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 50 TIMES. Hopefully another resolution is implemented soon, sorry for the minor rantr guys.<br /><br />-XXX

				Just tie forum accounts to SR accounts and be done with it, spammers get banned from SR and the Forums. Vendors should get a pass.

				Also a team of mods deleting spam would help, some people have loads of time on their hands to mod or at least spam hunt.
