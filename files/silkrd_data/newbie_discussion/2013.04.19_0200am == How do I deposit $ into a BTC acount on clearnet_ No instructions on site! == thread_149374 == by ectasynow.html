				There are many different ways and many different sites. Which site are you trying to use, exactly? I think the bigger exchanges will let you wire in money via a bank amongst many other ways, but that takes time and you have to verify your ID with them.<br />&nbsp;But there are many different ways, it all depends.

				It&#039;s just a bitcoin wallet that I downloaded and got the app for my phone. It&#039;s called &quot;bitcoin wallet&quot; and it lets people send bitcoins to and from each other. I just can&#039;t understand why it doesn&#039;t explain HOW to fund these wallets with cash! Any idea? And I don&#039;t really want to link my bank account to it since Big Brother nay be lurking.

				Yeah your wallet you&#039;ll have to send btc to by buying them somewhere else. I can provide two possible scenarios for you, without really reccomending either.<br /><br />1: You go to MtGox and register a username. They have about ten different ways to fund your MtGox account with USD, and then you use that USD to buy BTC at a price you specify. You then send the btc to your wallet address.<br /><br />2: You use bitinstant and select &#039;deposit to wallet&#039; when it asks where you&#039;d like to send your bitcoins. From there you can provide fake information, go to a WalMart/CVS and pay cash, and have btc in about an hour. Some people on SR have had trouble getting their BTC this way in the past few weeks, but it worked for me about a month ago twice.<br /><br />There&#039;s many other ways too. Good Luck!

				Okay...can I use my Mt. Gox account, without being verified, to send to my bitcoin wallet? Any issues that way?

				I&#039;m kind of new at this but I&#039;m gonna do my best to weigh in here. Anyone else is welcome to chime in and correct me if I&#039;m wrong here .. I&#039;m still learning.<br /><br />First of all, I doubt that using a bitcoin app on a phone which is registered in your name is any better than buying BTC with your bank account, and might even be a worse idea? Just a thought. Your phone is more accessible to LEO than your bank account. I wouldn&#039;t be doing any of this on my phone.<br /><br />As for your dilemma, I&#039;ve been trying to figure out the same thing, and here&#039;s what I&#039;ve concluded so far. You can access the BTC vendors using the clearnet, but this is not optimal since the BTC vendors will have your real ip address on record accessing that account, which voids your anonymity in the event you are investigated. As I understand it, &quot;doing it right&quot; means you need to use a VPN underneath your Tor browser to deal with the clearnet BTC guys anonymously and and not get flagged for using Tor. This sounds a lot more complicated than it is. All you have to do is download some free VPN software, run the VPN software, and then run Tor. Using this method I was able to create an unverified account, login and navigate the BTC vendors website using Tor without issue. This way, the clearnet websites talk to your VPN, and your VPN talks to Tor, removing the clearnet BTC vendors ability to detect Tor by being a middle man.<br /><br />The main problem with this is if you are using it from your home broadband connection. The VPN will know your real ip address, and LE could beat on them to give it up, which has happened. (hidemyass, lulzsec) but really, you&#039;re buying 100 bucks worth of drugs, not participating in large scale ddos attacks. Your threat level is not in the same bracket, so you&#039;ve probably got nothing to worry about.<br /><br />However, for the super paranoid, if you set up a free VPN account (fake name, email), and only use it at public wifi (coffee shops, internet cafe, mcdonalds, etc.) then, as far as I know, there is no way to trace you or your coins. If you purchase your BTC anonymously and only access your BTC account anonymously in this way, in a worst case scenario your BTC trail should lead them to the public wifi and a dead end.<br /><br />To access the clearnet BTC website I used a free VPN called &quot;TunnelBear&quot; which offers 500 free MB of traffic each month with a free account (which is plenty for our needs). It gives you the option to pick where in the world your IP will appear to be coming from, and when you turn it on, a new network connection pops up. Select the new network, and then run Tor. You might need to turn on javascript to log into certain websites, but you still have the VPN as a layer of security underneath Tor. This is where my knowledge wanes, but I figured I might be able to help with what I&#039;ve learned so far.<br /><br />IMHO, the way things are right now you could probably get away with a lot less precautions and be totally fine ...<br />However, overkill is only overkill until your enemy gets better at fighting back.<br /><br />Good luck :)
