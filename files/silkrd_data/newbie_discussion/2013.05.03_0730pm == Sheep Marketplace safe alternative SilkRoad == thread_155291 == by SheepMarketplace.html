				Hello all users,<br /><br />We are team of people who decided to make alternative anonymous Marketplace. Why not use a different server than Silkroad?<br /><br />1) We have a secure and professionally programmed web. The entire project is programmed in Nette Framework and other things in Qt C + +.<br />2) Lower commission up to 6%<br />3) Registration of a new distributor is only $ 20<br />4) We protect both seller and customer. Our SheepSupport really solves problems!<br />5) We have lots of new features for both the customer and vendor<br />6) feedback rating has customer!<br />7) We have a gallery and you can share photos<br />8) We own API and external software (SheepMarketplace Pager) for the community of people<br /><br />We want to move up the sales and will be happy for your support. We answer all your questions. Trolls not :)<br /><br />Your SheepMarketplace Team<br /><br />Web: <br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion<br />Or<br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion.to<br />Or<br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion.sh<br />Or <br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.tor2web.org

				Sheep marketplace sounds like a bad name.&nbsp; I&#039;m nervous to click any of those links, especially you posting in the newbie section.&nbsp; SheepSupport sounds like a really promising tool for sheep people.

				I have to agree with everyone else... horrible name for a black market. Even if it wasn&#039;t intentional, you&#039;re essentially calling your customers sheep. It&#039;s almost like your advertising that you have to be &quot;sheepish&quot; enough, or stupid, to buy anything from there. <br /><br />Marketing 101: Never insult potential customers

				I don&#039;t know yet. It takes time to build credibility for anything, let alone an anonymous, online market.<br /><br />I won&#039;t jump on board this until I&#039;m convinced that it&#039;s for real and is in for the long haul. I didn&#039;t jump on Bitcoin until last year for the same reason.<br /><br />It could be real. Or it could be a honeypot. I&#039;ll wait and see.

				Hi Folks,<br />We were very active on both SR and the Forums before its unfortunate demise. Thanks for all the good work in the past guys.<br />Since October 2nd we have set up seller accounts on both Sheep Market place and Black Market Reloaded and have found Sheep Marketplace to be the most intuitive and easiest to use. A new Escrow system is in place for buyer protection, a feedback system for both buyer and seller, general availability of the site is MUCH better than BMR and trade is brisk. Certainly less would be scammers and definitely less trolls. Unlike SR the moderators still have a tight control of the forums and bad behaviour is not tolerated. A refreshing change and quite adult about it all. <br />We are certainly not telling you guys what to do , just letting you know of our experiences.<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />Machine Elves

				Would like to re-iterate that the SHEEP Marketplace is actually a very good substitute for SR at present.<br /><br />We are signed up on BMR (Site is SHITE and never loads or pics are missing and seems to be constantly being DDOS&#039;d) and had no sales.<br /><br />Via Sheep we have already sold 11 items with a further 6 in transit with NO ISSUES.<br /><br />The support team are fantastic and the forums are not full of &quot;moaning types&quot; often found here.<br /><br />Once SR is back up we will return, but until then we are extremely happy with the service, speed, layout and customer base we are getting from sheep.&nbsp; &nbsp;EVERY customer has used PGP and been extremely polite and paid promptly.........unlike a a few previous SR Sales!!<br /><br />Dont get us wrong we preferred SR, but please don&#039;t diss the SHEEP.<br /><br />As DPR always said, &quot;Treat EVERY site as if it has already been compromised, even SR.&quot;&nbsp; - Play Safe kids.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Hi all, I was a vendor here for btc and am now a vendor on sheep under this name. Sheep has been legit since I&#039;ve been on and I do not have any complaints through many transactions. <br /><br />If you all need btc, send me a PM here (I&#039;m obviously still involved in the forums), or find me on sheep while you&#039;re checking it out. I&#039;ll be glad to be your provider of btc going forward!<br /><br />Thanks.
