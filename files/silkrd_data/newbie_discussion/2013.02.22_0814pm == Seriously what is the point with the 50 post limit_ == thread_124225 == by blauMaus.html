				To prove that you can solve 50 captchas?<br />As you can spam here as you want, this is just stealing the time of the new buyers.<br />I want to place feedback for the DRUGS i bought and nothing else. what a waste of time.

				You can still post reviews and feedback here.&nbsp; In fact, PrincessHIGH even created a thread for people to post their feedback in and she then copies and pastes it into the vendor&#039;s thread for you.<br /><br />Also, the reason for this 50 post rule is to help us get a better handle on the bitcoin spammer situation.&nbsp; This way, we have a better chance of noticing them, deleting their scamming posts, and banning their accounts before they are able to spam the entire forum -- it&#039;s all contained in this single subforum.<br /><br />And before you say &quot;well now we have to become spammers to get out!&quot; let me remind you that the people spamming to get to 50 posts are actual members of the community --- the bitcoin spammers, on the other hand, are spamming in order to scam people out of their money.&nbsp; Big difference between the two types of spam.

				yeah, feel free to spam your way to 50 ... you can even start your own thread for it and it&#039;ll take less time.&nbsp; <br /><br />sorry, i know it is an inconvenience for those who don&#039;t like to post much, but it has made a huge, huge difference because we&#039;re usually able to catch the spammers before they get to 50 posts ... which means catching them before they are able to flood all of the subforums with their scams.<br /><br />thanks for your understanding ... +1 karma for that.&nbsp; :)
