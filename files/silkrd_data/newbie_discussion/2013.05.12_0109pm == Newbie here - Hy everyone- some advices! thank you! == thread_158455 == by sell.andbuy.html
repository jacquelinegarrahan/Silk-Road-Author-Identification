				Yes you are in the right place sir. Just browse away at the forums and read through the wiki. There are a lot of aspects you need to consider and become familiar with. But once you get it, it becomes quite easy and it really is incredible.

				The security section is definitely a great place of this forum :)<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend the use of a non persistent system (tails, liberte linux or even better create your own usb/encrypted system) &amp; to use GPG for everything that contains private information...<br /><br />Welcome on board anyway and.. good luck!<br /><br />:D

				I think the hardest thing for getting started is actually buying bitcoins. So many sites yet no easy, noob-friendly method. And mining is almost pointless now!
