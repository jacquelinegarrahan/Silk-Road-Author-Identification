				Hello&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I know Drug Test topics have always been frowned upon on many forums, but I know people here are wise and might even share my experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />First off, my drug test is not legal related - I go to a Methadone Clinic and get tested there for increased privileges etc.&nbsp; So basically my clinic does oral testing, which has never been a problem for me.&nbsp; Oral tests usually only respond up to a week tops for any substance, but I ran into a problem the other weekend.&nbsp; I had earned the highest level privileges at my clinic from being clean for years, but I recently went on a rolling/drug weekend bender.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using Mephedrone for a long time and never had a problem testing positive from it.&nbsp; However, the other weekend I partied hard with a big group of people with some dank MDMA (thanks SR! lol :)), and I usually could time my last use before my oral test at the clinic.&nbsp; This one weekend I went too long and my MDMA use carried over from Sunday into the test on Tuesday.&nbsp; Because they saw this as weird since I hadn&#039;t tested positive in a long time, they gave me a urine test... I was thinking &quot;fuck.. really?.&quot;&nbsp; It was ugly, it came back as Meth (MDMA false positive for Meth), Opiates (MS Contin 60s I did the morning after a roll face), THC (danks) and Benzos (this I was like wtf! - I had done a Valium like a week and a half before, but I&#039;ve read Valium is the longest trace testing Benzo you can do :/)!&nbsp; I was reduced two levels of priveleges, and went on my way and didn&#039;t do anything but Meph from then on.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went in today and found out the last oral I did a week after my last bender still came up as Meth.&nbsp; I thought maybe it was the Meph, or maybe it was just the MDMA in my system..&nbsp; So I&#039;m talking to my counselor and I&#039;m like I&#039;d like to test myself today to prove I don&#039;t have Meth in my system.&nbsp; Now I was thinking I would get Oral swabbed, but they gave me a urine again, and again I was like wtf...&nbsp; The good thing on that was they get the result right then from the cup indicators, and I came back positive for THC and Benzos still, but no Meth.&nbsp; I explained that the THC made sense since I had smoked danks for a while and would probably piss positive for a while, the Benzos I was curious on..&nbsp; I had read Valium especially can test positive in urine for up to 8 weeks, and I know I don&#039;t drink a lot of water trying to clean my system out.&nbsp; <br /><br />So my question is - has anyone else experienced drug positives in categories in Meth or Benzos from straight Meph use?&nbsp; I got a different batch from my normal vendor, and started to wonder if that was the cause.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my situation, and any responses are much welcomed.<br /><br />Hippy peace,<br />b420
