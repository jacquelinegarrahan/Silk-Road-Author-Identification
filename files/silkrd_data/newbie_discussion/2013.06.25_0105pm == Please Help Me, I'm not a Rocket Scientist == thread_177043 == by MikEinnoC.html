				Hi,<br />I joined SR back on Friday and have been frantically trying to figure out this bitcoin thing ever since. I&#039;ve been to coinbase (the still haven&#039;t deposited in to my account). Blockchain....they keep giving me errors. Even ebay....which the guy keeps ending me cryptic emails I don&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about. Can anyone please help me in an easy way I can under stand? THANK YOU!

You can order after hours, but you need to include &quot;early order&quot; in the subject line and you will make your deposit on the following day.<br /><br />Step 2: follow his instructions EXACTLY for depositing money into his account at the Bank of America.

				No Bank of America near me, just checked. I&#039;d be a good customer if someone could help me with this. Coinbase told me they would verify my account within 3 days....today is day 3 and I still haven&#039;t heard anything. Is there anything else I can try? Thanks guys. I&#039;m certified in web development and I think this is the most complex thing I ever did on the web. So if that is the intent....it&#039;s working.

				I haven&#039;t used coinbase, but I think YOU have to verify your account. Like lots of other sites they make two deposits like 17 cents and 33 cents, and then you have to enter those on their site to verify your account. That makes sure they have the right bank account and you actually have access to the account to see the deposits. Then from there I believe they have a 5 or 7 business day waiting period until you can transfer the BTC.

You have the option to pay someone a paysafecard or one of the gas station debit cards and they even have a built in escrow system.

				Coinbase now has a step where you have to verify a phone number and it has to be a cell phone so they can send you an SMS. I emailed to inform them that I have made several transactions with them in the past and this was new to me and that I don&#039;t have a cell phone ( I really don&#039;t). They emailed back that they are working on ways to accommodate us luddites. I am not really interested in doing business with them any more.
