				this was my first buy on SR and i&#039;m going to be positive, hopefully a package or refund will come out of it. however i did change my feedback to a 1 until a package or refund which would be a 5 rating. I&#039;ll change it to a 2 if PPLLUURR gets back to my messages. hasn&#039;t gotten back to me in two days.

				I dont get why people FE, I understand its really tempting due to price or whatever the reasoning is but use your head before you order. DO NOT FE even if your a new user, DO NOT FE even if the seller has 100% feedback. please people stop FE&#039;ing I really feel bad when people lose their coins this easy.np

				u know i always think about it like maybe these vendors just get tired of being a vendor, something comes up they have tostop who knows...and they just figure hey ill grab myself a few extra btcs before i peace lets see how many dopes will finalize early.....then again it makes u think SR is kind of in on it...why would they make the option available in the first place if there biggest concern is scammers. the FE button should be changed to &quot;click here to get f*cked&quot;. <br /><br />*what exactly is the FE option for??? who is it benefiting? hmm
