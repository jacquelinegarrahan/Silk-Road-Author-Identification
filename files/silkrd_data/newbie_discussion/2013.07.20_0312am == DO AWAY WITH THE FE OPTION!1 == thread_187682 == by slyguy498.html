				I have fe on two orders for free shipping with vendors i hadnt ordered from and both worked out. Secondly I have a relationship with a certain vendor. I always fe for him in piticular on every order&nbsp; which is about 5 orders so he can get his money as soon as possible and because I do that for him he helps me out a lot. Its all about the love!<br /><br />We are a community here and if you can&#039;t trust someone to not screw you over then just use the escrow. I know thier are scammers but I would put my trust in almost every single vendor on sr. Not all but most.

				I think the same people who like drugs also like gambling a bit.&nbsp; Keep the FE!<br /><br />Honestly I think there are enough options that you dont need to FE.&nbsp; Usually people FE when they are new, there is a good deal and trusted vendor. I did it after HOURS of research.&nbsp; Its a calculated bet.

				Sometimes, the buyers offer to FE themselves. Like kimlee said especially when they&#039;re new. It helps them get the ball rolling so to speak. I&#039;m sure most vendors with a stellar reputation won&#039;t try to scam buyers who FE, especially when the order is a tiny fraction of their overall business.

				The FE option is only allowed for sellers who have made enough successful transactions to ask buyers to FE, which I think is reasonable. I don&#039;t mind FE for legit sellers who don&#039;t scam.

				I don&#039;t see a problem with finalizing early.&nbsp; Sometimes it is just going to be much easier to deal with as a vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Think of this: if a vendor ships something to you ship regular mail they have no proof of delivery anyway.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a trustworthy vendor, then why not FE?&nbsp; It cannot actually protect the buyer to hold the funds in escrow since without tracking there can be no proof of non-delivery anyway, so SR support is almost guaranteed to side with the long-standing and trusted vendor.&nbsp; The only protection not FEing can provide, is from a vendor that has actually decided to sacrifice/abandon their vendor account in order to rip - and you should be able to minimize that with minimal due-vigilance.<br /><br />Personally, if I order from a trusted vendor, I always FE.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it&#039;s nice as a vendor to not have to wait for the funds to get released - it&#039;s not like the vendor didn&#039;t already incur the costs associated with dispensing the product.

				Everyone keeps saying &quot;FE option.&quot;&nbsp; THERE IS NO &quot;FE OPTION!&quot;&nbsp; When you finalize you are agreeing that you received your product and are satisfied.&nbsp; I repeat, THERE IS NO FE OPTION!!!<br /><br /><br />HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET RID OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN&#039;T EXIST?&nbsp; Who you gonna call?&nbsp; GHOST BUSTERS!

				Finalizing Early is like fronting cash to a dealer in the real world and trusting him to bring you your drugs later. If you know the guy, fine. But even then you can get screwed if his life takes a wrong turn.<br /><br />The most important difference, however, is that you can&#039;t threaten someone on the Internet. I don&#039;t condone violence, and I&#039;m not trying to sound &quot;hard,&quot; but I always come prepared on the street. I&#039;ve only had to display my piece once, but I&#039;m glad I had it, or I would have lost more than I could afford.<br /><br />With escrow, you and the dealer hand your cash/drugs to a FUCKING PIRATE, and he makes sure neither of you is a scallywag. (I don&#039;t mean to suggest Dread Pirate Roberts actually handles anything, it&#039;s just an illustration.)<br /><br />As for the &quot;re-up&quot; excuse, I&#039;m unmoved by it. If you can&#039;t carry enough to cover a few days, why are you on the Silk Road?

				It&#039;s a nice old saying, but in practice, trust on SR does not work both ways. In practice, sellers are &quot;heroes&quot; whose praises are sung by the powers that be, while buyers are expected to shoulder unreasonable risk and be grateful for it. For all the flowery free-market rhetoric, the prevailing attitude is not much different from meatspace capitalism.<br /><br />At any rate, when a buyer places an order, his funds are at least confirmed to exist. Not so for the seller&#039;s product. Asking the buyer, who has placed his money on the table, to FE before he even sees the product, is unreasonable and one-sided.

				The option to FE is okay and should stay IMO. Nobody is forced to use it, vendors usually clearly state it on their vendor page when and if FE is required and there are always enough options where no FE is needed just to build stats

				I am Not Sure what you mean excactly. <br />You are talking of not allowing the vendor to request FE?<br />Or you Talking about the finalize Button. <br />In Last Case as Many Said its Not a FE Option. Its meant to complete a successfull Transaktion. <br />And how should someone know when this is. <br />By clicking you confirm everything Went Fine and Pay. <br />So nö Deals would be possible without paying<br />If you Talk about the allowance to ASK for FE. Well its a Free market, choose another One or be clear for yourself that you Risk something by FE. I Rather Risk AT a reputable (Forum) vendor than choosing a Not as Good gear whch i Stick in my veins. Small amounts , Build up a trust buyer History and thAn buy without FE. <br />There is always the Chance something may go wrong. Vendor busted, parcel busted etc. <br />But AT the end it is the choice of everyone Personally. You dont have a Gun AT your Head and be told to give the Money :)
