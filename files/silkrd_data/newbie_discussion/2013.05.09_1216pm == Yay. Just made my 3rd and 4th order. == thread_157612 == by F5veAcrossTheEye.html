				My first ever order on a different profile was from Tyl3r Durden and everything went smoothly! I got 25 tabs of 25i-NBOMe all arrived and tabs where good! I then ordered from him again but got the snuff caps of 25i, I would definitely say that the snuff caps where better than the tabs! He also gave me 3 free tabs with my first order and 2 free snuff caps of 25c with my second order

				Tyl3r is good, He has nearly doubled my orders on multiple occasions, and on big orders too. I would be cautious with the snuff caps though. A friend ordered off him a while back and could have sworn he got a highly over dosed cap and tripped the fuck out on 25i. Said he felt like he was OD&#039;ing and he was not in a good way at all and this is from a very experienced tripper.<br /><br />I&#039;ve finished experimenting with the NBOMes&#039; now, I enjoyed 25c the most, still an awesome psychedelic, but you know its all about the tryptamines ;).<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought 2C-B off Ivory. That stuff was pretty peng. Everyone I sold to loved it.<br /><br />I remember my first purchase. Some lovely Ketamine from dmtdoodeelsd. Great first purchase. :)

Its just your gonna come up much faster when sniffing a cap (Just like any other 2C) over doing oral dosing from a blotter. I preferred the tabs, smoother come up and more manageable. I even enjoyed the numbing-bitter taste it had on your gums aha!!<br /><br />3 was the highest I ever went with the 25c. Lovely stuff but I won&#039;t be needing anymore for a while. DOM is the next one ;).
