				This is our NEWBIE review thread, for all customers who do not exceed the 50 post limit. <br /><br />When you have more then 50 posts, please post it in the general review thread;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141756.0<br /><br /><br />***[Introduction]***<br /><br />-Capsule Corp comes from a childhood love. Those of you familiar with DBZ know that this is the company responsible for the manufacture and sales of spacecrafts, time machines, magical capsules, and gravity chambers. While we may not have some of those yet, we are in the business of magic capsules and orals that give you heightened senses, enhanced perception, interesting voyages, and incredible memories for hours! For messaging purposes you may call me Bulma, as I&#039;m both female and the representative of Capsule Corp. :)<br /><br /><br />***[Mission Statement]***<br /><br />-In late 2012 a call was received from a buddy saying that a friend of mine was in the ER with heart palpitations, hypertension, respiratory distress, and chest pain. He had ingested amongst others, a substance known as BZP assuming it was MDMA. This scenario is far too common in the US and it is just as much the sellers responsibility as it is the buyers when it comes to honesty and safety. The goods sold here are a double edged sword. In the hands armed with knowledge they can lead to some of the most exciting and memorable times of your life, but in the clutches of greed there is potential for serious harm.<br /><br />-We are a group of professionals dedicated to supplying only the safest unadulterated products. We will not sell something we have not tested ourselves. Our knowledge base comes from many walks of life, so I will answer any curiosities or questions to the best of my ability.<br /><br /><br />***[Terms of Service]***<br /><br />-Bitcoins only. I stay in escrow.<br />-PGP at your discretion.<br />-I reserve the right to refuse service.<br /><br /><br />***[Refunds]***<br /><br />-If for some reason you&#039;re unhappy with your product, get in contact with us so that we may remedy the problem.<br />-Minimum of 21 days in transit before item may be suggested lost in transit.<br />-If DCN shows confirmation, no refund given.<br /><br /><br />***[Shipping]***<br /><br />Standard Precautions;<br />-All shipments are encapsulated in moisture resistant and vacuumed bags.<br />-Handling is done gloved and exterior package cleaned from contaminants or residue.<br />-Mailed from one of 3+ locations.<br />-Standard or Houdini stealth available.<br />-Return address and printed labels used.<br />-Tracking on all shipments.<br /><br />Priority - (2-4 days)<br />Overnight - (Next day, in most cases)<br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to PM us!

				Pasting some reviews from custom orders that do not show on page;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Completely satisfied! The package came 2 days after i ordered and I couldn&#039;t be happier! The pill quality was second to none and the seller was extremely nice and fast-responding to my questions. They threw in the definition of extra, along with a free pill for the road. All was securely packaged with a festive touch that was very fun to open. All in all, I couldn&#039;t be happier with the shipping speed and to have given a new seller this chance! Very pleased with all aspects of their business and will be a comeback customer. The whole process was smooth and safe, and like i said before, i couldn&#039;t be happier. Thanks Capsule Corp!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WOW!! This vendor was more than happy to give me a free sample, and it came super quickly!! and holy shit that stealth! unfrickinbelievable. The best stealth I&#039;ve ever seen. Cant wait to try this stuff out!!<br />His communication was quick and he was super helpful. Literally everything about this vendor is great!! You&#039;ll do great here on the Road!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller exhibited great communication skills and shipment was swift and stealthy. In fact, almost too stealthy! I really had to look hard to find what I had ordered. Very well done, would recommend.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fantastic. Super quick shipping, 4 days in total after I placed the order. Opted for the Houdini stealth and it certainly did not disappoint. Haven&#039;t tried the pills yet, but I know the red ?&#039;s are good. Nothing crushed. Can&#039;t wait for them to restock, amazing vendor! Highly recommend.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks for the hook up, and fucking great packaging.
