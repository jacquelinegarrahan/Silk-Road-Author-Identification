				Hello, I have a question regarding receiving mail.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t made any orders yet, because I want to be sure of what I&#039;m doing when it comes to where to have the stuff sent to.&nbsp; I thought I had a plan, until I came here and read about &#039;safe drop points&#039; etc., and a lot of people also seem to use PO boxes, but I just don&#039;t have the money for one of those.<br /><br />I thought maybe the people using PO boxes were only meaning when receiving a bulk order, but I&#039;m not sure. I think what I want to know is, just how detached from you and your identity does the receiving address need to be? I mean, could I send it to say, a friend? Is it really that bad of an idea to send it to your home address, no matter how little is in the envelope?

				Hi,<br />Im a newbie too,but from what i comprended the main rules for addresses are:<br />1 the name has to match with the receiving address (in order to avoid controls)<br />2 the goods must be kept in an different place than the order(in order to avoid controls)<br />3 the receiving address must be a clean address (this is a personal thought) because if the bag get busted for sure a control is coming at the place,and i dont think you want to fuck up a close friend (i also thought about blackmailing some people with explicit bad stealthing requests,but after i thought about how much is important to keep the goods for me lol)<br />4 less people know about it and better it is

				Not sure what you mean for No. 2, do you mean you should get the goods out of the place they are delivered to as soon as possible?<br /><br />For No.1, I&#039;m not sure if that applies in the uk, I&#039;ve had legal stuff, tshirts and stuff, delivered to joke names at my home many many times over the years, I&#039;ve only ever had to go and pick it up from the post office if it&#039;s been a big thing. I understand the need for the envelope or package to &#039;blend in&#039; as it were with the rest of the mail though so I will be using correct details.<br /><br />It&#039;s coming up with a safe place I can regularly use. It would be handy if there was a guide available for this kind of thing.<br /><br />Thanks!

				In the UK, they don&#039;t care who&#039;s name is on the package, they will deliver anything sent to your address, however, a real name is still better. It would only be your local posty who would notice the names anyhow, and he&#039;s just concerned with ditching a van full of letters and parcels and getting home.<br />
