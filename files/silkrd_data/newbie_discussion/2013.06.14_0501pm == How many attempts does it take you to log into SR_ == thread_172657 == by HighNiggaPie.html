				It&#039;s been alright for me the past few times, but it can be annoying when you&#039;ve typed your Username and Password in what seems like twenty times, only to be redirected back to the login page once again! It&#039;s a vicious circle...hahah

				Usually just 1.&nbsp; I find their CAPTCHA to be the best I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; No crazy text fonts or lines or any of that.&nbsp; I&#039;m also a pretty good typist so I usually key in everything right the first time.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve usually been able to log in after a single attempt....are you all saying it&#039;s difficult to remember your passwords or that SR does not recognize your correct combo?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been unable to log in with what I&#039;m 99% sure is the correct user/passcode combo..... does anyone know if SR deletes inactive accounts? I hadn&#039;t made any transactions on that one.

				Tips for getting in quicker:<br /><br />Change your identity via Tor until your IP shows an IP registered in the Country you live in.<br />Always make sure there is a COMPLETE &#039;captcha&#039; when you attempt to log in -- if it&#039;s just 3 digits; it&#039;s &#039;broken&#039; and you need to reload the page until you see a complete captcha (medit938) for example.<br /><br /><br />Hope that helps!

				Once.&nbsp; If any more than that, I always assume that I typed the password wrong.&nbsp; I always make sure the captcha has 5 letters + 3 numbers.&nbsp; If it fails more than 3 times, I delete, download, and reinstall the TBB.

				I find it helps to refresh right after the login page shows up. For some reason, the captcha expires very quickly on the first load and I don&#039;t always enter in my info quick enough. So now I don&#039;t even bother trying to login on the first attempt and hit refresh right away. Seems to always work for me.

				I change the password every time it takes more than one attempt after a refresh. Call me paranoid if you must.
