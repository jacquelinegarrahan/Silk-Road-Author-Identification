				This is the weakness in being anonymous and also buying from those who claim to be anonymous!&nbsp; At some point, if the vendor is sloppy or just lazy, their will be a paper trail.&nbsp; When it comes to addresses it all comes down to the vendor you are dealing with.&nbsp; You leave that mystery in there hands.&nbsp; Best thing to do is to assume all vendors keep your address and to protect it as much as possible.&nbsp;

				I do recall reading that in the vendor forum. This was all discussed in the vendor forum.

				Wow. That really is something to be concerned about. If this vendor is doing so he should be removed asap. Nobody should be allowed putting his customers at risk to gain an advantage over everyone else. <br /><br />Pretty hard for DPR to kick his best seller he makes the most money off. But the right path would still be to make a statement and ban him really. There is nothing that rectifies his action.

				I just want to weigh in here that what is stated in the original post in this thread needs to be taken in the context of the thread that the quoted message actually appears in. All is not as it seems when re-posted here. Regardless of that thread&#039;s context, however, I did send the issue up the chain to administrators and received word that discussions were underway with the vendor in question. As such, the case can be considered closed.<br /><br />Again, the original post appears here without the context of the other posts surrounding it from the thread it actually appears in. Please do not pass judgement based on what was posted in this thread alone.<br /><br />From what I can tell, SuperTrips is an exceptionally good vendor and can be trusted with buyer information. He said what he did in a discussion about buyers that attempt to scam vendors, and as sinister as the post in question may seem, it appears that it was indeed stated in a hypothetical sense rather than being factual in nature.<br /><br />Libertas
