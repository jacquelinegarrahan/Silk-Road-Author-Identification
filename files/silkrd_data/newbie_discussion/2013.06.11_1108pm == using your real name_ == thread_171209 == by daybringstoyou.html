				hello, <br />&nbsp; i am new to silk road i have placed a few orders on here but have used a fake name.I have only order twice since i have started using silk road and both times i used a different name. when i got my package in the mail someone had circled the name and put a question make beside it. This has got me a little nervous. what do you guys think?&nbsp; &nbsp;I was also recently looking though some vendors on the road and a bunch were saying to use your real name when filling out your address. Now i always kind of thought this was a bad idea. But if it will cause a problem in shipping then i would like to correct it. Is it a good or bad idea to use your real name?

				I&#039;m new here too and definitely am not an expert. From what i&#039;ve read though everyone suggests you use your REAL name since postal workers won&#039;t deliver / might get suspicious if random packages are going to a residence. The same person delivers your mail and eventually gets an idea about which names live where. Hope that helps!

				There isn&#039;t really any reason to use a fake name on postal addresses. If anything it just generates needless suspicion. Even if your order is intercepted or whatever, anyone could have ordered it to your house in your name. Using a fake name really has no benefit.

				No reason not to use your name. Higher delivery rate means less scrutiny overall.

				Def use real name, if vendor sends recorded you could end up with your drugs sitting at the local post office with a random name on the parcel and no way to collect it.

				but seriously, use your real name. fake name + real address = questionable delivery (evidenced by the question mark) x red flag x justasriskyifnotmoreso than using real name<br /><br />check out that thread by the postal worker in the newbie section. you&#039;re just getting normal mail that happens to contain drugs, but you&#039;re the only one who knows that!<br /><br />oh, and welcome to sr! I think you&#039;re gonna like it here&nbsp; :D

				it raises unnecessary suspicion, your better off studying your mailman. This is your best way of avoiding a CD just never sign for anything if asked and then LE can&#039;t do anything (which is probably why you would use a fake name.)
