				Hi All<br /><br />Two questions. Have I got something wrong here? If not then what can I do?<br /><br />Joined the silk about 2 months ago. Been waiting till all felt right before going ahead. Entered my pin when I first registered and WROTE IT DOWN. Created a wallet yesterday to deposit money to but now when I try to use it to make a purchase it doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />So I have 5 bitcoins now sitting in a wallet I can&#039;t get to.<br /><br />And there&#039;s a party on Friday night which I want to make a purchase for and the purchase needs to be made by tomorrow to make it in time.<br /><br />I have also generated a new wallet hoping that would give me some hint as to where the pin is because I was so sure the pin must be separate to the one I recorded (yes I was getting desperate)<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way to make the purchase for Friday (which I&#039;ll need to do tomorrow). Do I have to create a whole new silk road account?<br /><br />And can I ever get my lost bitcoins back?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Newbie

				I am confused as to what the wallet it is that you created and what PIN you are referring to. If you mean the SR pin, which you need to create an SR account, that has nothing to do with the wallet you created yesterday.<br /><br />If you have lost the PIN to the SR account then you can contact SR Support and they will sort you a new PIN, but it could take about a week.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think that is the problem. Where are these 5 bitcoins now? In a wallet you created yesterday? Then how could you loose the PIN to that so quickly, and normally an on line wallet does not use a PIN but a password, and with some wallets it is the URL to the wallet that is the key to that wallet.<br /><br />Can&#039;t help if you don&#039;t explain more, but I think you may have misunderstood how it all works.<br />If you post some more info then maybe we can help.
