				You won&#039;t be able to finalize until the vendor marks it &#039;in transit&#039;. The status is currently &#039;processing&#039; (you can&#039;t finalize when it is in the &#039;processing&#039; state).

				Hello whizz!<br /><br />ARE YOU SURE TO FE???<br /><br />Does the Vendor have good stats like 97% 98% and good feedback? Is he long on the road?<br /><br />If yes than you can make FE<br /><br />The system of the Road:<br /><br />1)You order something<br />2)If the vendor have time, he pack your stuff, an set the status from N/A to &quot;in transit&quot; this means he has shipped it away(your parcel is on the postway)<br />3)Than you can finalize and also can give him feedback, the feedback you can change everytime, The&nbsp; people which have to FE write: FE because of the rules, will update<br />4) if you get the pills , you can change your feedback , click for this on the account button in the middle on the top of the site, view feedback, their you can change it, if you get some crushed or not enough pills maybe only 9 instead of 10, write ah pm to the vendor, if he says, shit happens, than you can give him 4/5 or 3/5, never describe exactly how the stealth look like, NEVER, and also not something which could identify you or the vendor, also not your name!<br />For example if everything went good: Everything fine, stealth was really good, shipment took 10 days to middle EU (no country names is safer), quality is also good for the price, communication could be better!<br /><br /><br /><br />IF YOU GET IT WITH TRACKING DO NOT USE THE TRACKING SITE IN TOR, THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR YOU!<br />USE AH NORMAL INTERNET BROWSER; NEVER TOR FOR TRACKING NUMBER SEARCHING!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />@ WHIZZ PLEASE PM me only that i know if you choose a good vendor! and i also could help you with the SR system!!!<br /><br />Regards

				the vendor got 99.1% positive feedback. <br />but the strange thing about it is when i ask him when can i finalize he responds with now, but when i chck my order there is still no finalize button. <br />but the message he send me before was: <br /><br />Hey,<br /><br />Your order has been sent to you.<br />It will take approximately 3 to 10 working days until delivery (depending on your location).<br /><br />If your get the idea that an order takes too long to arrive (more than 14 days) please notify us. ** Also if you are not satisfied about a product, please send us a PM before rating the order.<br /><br />so i think the best thing will be to just waith when i can finalize and check my mailbox
