				Hey, my name is Chan, i&#039;m pretty new to the tor network. Just started using the tor network about maybe a month ago, so far I&#039;ve ordered two things off SR and earned a few microbitcoins on a few faucets. I like the whole idea of bit coins and that it keeps the anonymity. I have a question about a recent trip that i experience, i took 500ug of 25i-NBOMe, i don&#039;t think i was in the greatest mood going into it which was stupid on my part, but anyways i was on the ground for hours and i ended up dry heaving and the whole world was spinning. It was the worst trip of my life, it was only my second time taking it as well, the first trip was nice and bright and felt nice but this one was horrible. Does anyone know why this happened to me?&nbsp;

				Ive never had a problem or experienced anything like that on 25i. I like 25i quite a lot.<br />Where you on any other drugs before taking it, and how long ago was the last 25i trip you had?<br /><br />When I first started taking 25i-NBOMe I would use 500-600 ug, and the closest thing I would have to a bad experience was just one time walking around the daytime outside, the brightness and the people throughout the neighborhood made me pretty uncomfortable. But nothing bad.<br /><br />Now I prefer to take a full 1200ug hit or so, to really make the trip happen. A 500-600ug dose to me feels &#039;halfway&#039; and I feel more in a limbo where the body knows its under some effect but the mind isnt really experiencing it heavily.<br /><br />You certain what you had was 25i?

				I took maybe 250ug my first time ever trying it, but i think it was because it was the very next day (not even 24 hours) that i took the 500ug, i wasn&#039;t on anything else other than weed. I ordered the 25i off a vendor from SR so i&#039;m sure it was 25i. It was a bad experience for sure but i don&#039;t think it ruined 25i for me completely because i&#039;m going to try it again fairly soon i think. Do you have any tips or fun things that i can do while on it? haha i wanna have a good time while im on it.

				Well, I havent ever used it two days in a row, Id probably rather sleep and relax the next day. Ill go several weeks or more in between hits, and make sure Im setup and comfortable with good people, with drinks and weed on hand, somewhere safe and nice. Always had a good time with lots of laughs and nice visuals. <br />Ive found on the come-up, about the time of taking the blotter out, a few cones and couple drinks help me relax and ease into the trip ahead.

				Im not really much a drinker myself, but i found that smoking a few bowls on the come down helped the first time. My friend actually wants to try it but he doesnt know if he should be drinking while he is on it, whats it like while drinking vs not drinking?

				I like to go into it with a clean head. Straight, with the exception of some weed earlier in the day of course. <br />I usually dont drink more than 3 or 4 drinks on it anyway, Im more occupied on other things around to be knocking drinks down. The drinks just help me relax in the beginning, and am sipping along the night. For the most part you should try be straight before you begin, no need to be drinking or anything. You should have a good time then. Just get somewhere safe and in a good vibe and just keep a few drinks and weed and cigarettes or whatever on hand as supplies just in case you feel you want a little of them throughout the night. I gave up cigarettes years ago but often end up really wanting and having one or more early in the night, same with the drinks.<br />But you should really give yourself good time between doses, many weeks or more would be ideal.
