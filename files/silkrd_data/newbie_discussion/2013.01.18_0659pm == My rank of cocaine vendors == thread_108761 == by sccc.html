				As for some reason I can&#039;t post in Rumor Mill here is my (and friend&#039;s) subjective opinion on C vendors.<br /><br />I ordered from 4 vendors so far (AfterHour, Budworks UK, c63amg and Lloydbrothers).<br /><br />Here are my opinions some of them posted already in vendors&#039; review threads:<br /><br />AfterHour:<br /><br />I have tried his coke. No probs with ordering and FE requirement, received within 1 week, very good stealth.<br /><br />I am not very experienced user, I&#039;ve only tried diff street coke few times.<br /><br />Very nice white color, scent not very intensive like ones I tried before.<br /><br />Shared with a friend, both had nice high from small amounts lasting around 20-30 mins, not much numbing effect, but it&#039;s probably due small doses (1g in total per evening). Had some problems with sleeping after (never happened with street coke) and the day after wasn&#039;t pleasant as well.<br /><br />UPDATE: after trying different suppliers, I must admit that this coke clogged my nose for the whole next day, which wasn&#039;t very pleasant. Friend said it had too much speedy effect.<br /><br />Budworx UK<br /><br />Got 3.5 g from Budworx UK, was a bit afraid with FE requirement, but took a risk.<br /><br />Delivered within 1 week in EU.<br /><br />The quality is very good, very smooth for nose, no clogging, which was happening with other vendors.<br /><br />First evening got 0.7g divided between two ppl and had great 6 hrs, no big problems with falling asleep after that.<br /><br />As above, no noticeable comedown you just want to do more ;)<br /><br />Will be ordering again! So far, the best I have got from SR. <br /><br />Update: my friend liked other coke more than this one, for me - still the best one.<br /><br />Lloydsbrothers<br /><br />Veeeery smooth and nice C! Got only half gram within less than 1 week! 2 ppl had amazing evening! Very nice white color, shiny, very intensive scent and really smooth for nose! Pretty nice numbing effect. No urge to redose, took some time to fall asleep, but anyway it was pleasant, had many many nice dreams after that! Friend of mine said that woke up with grind on a face and next day was just great! No noticeable calm down, definitely worth trying! <br />However, vendor could improve stealth a bit.<br /><br />Will be definitely ordering again! Friend&#039;s favorite, mine - 2nd place<br /><br />c63amg<br />I liked it very much, though it burns nose just a bit. I ordered only sample (got 0.2g) - received also very quickly - the best stealth here! Friend of mine also tried but after 1 line gave up because of burning (but tbh it&#039;s not the worst burning you can have). Also nice white color, but a bit different consistency than Bud and Lloyd&#039;s.<br />Had this sample for myself and I would put it just below Budworx (though still in favor to Budworx&#039;s).<br /><br />Will be ordering again if I will lack of BTC ;)<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Mine:<br />1 - Budworx UK<br />2 - Lloydsbrothers<br />3 - c63amg<br />4 - AfterHour<br /><br />Friend&#039;s:<br />1 - Lloydsbrothers<br />2 - Budworx UK<br />3 - AfterHour<br />4 - c63amg.<br /><br />Will be updating once ordered more!<br /><br />Thank you!

				thanks for that,<br /><br />A question,<br />as lloydsbrother&#039;s coke more expensive (11,5 btc), does it worth it compare to others ?<br />specially c63amg : 8,39 btc<br /><br />thanks<br />

				I&#039;ve been buying off FrankMatthews.&nbsp; Very good quality, packaging was very stealthy and have to give 11/10 for that one.<br />Coke was easy to cut, not rocky, dissolved in water.&nbsp; Very good on the nose, great numbing effect and best of all it blew mine and my boyfriends socks off.<br />Its the type of stuff you take in small quantities, not the huge lines we decided to do first.

				I think ranks speak for themselves ;) Like I said if I would be in lack of BTC, I would go for c63amg, but friend said that no way doing c63amg coke again! <br /><br />For now I&#039;ll stick to Lloydsbrothers, it&#039;s really easy to cut with the razor and very smooth for nose, maybe not biggest blast you can have, but instead you get a very nice steady high for a long time, no burning whatsoever. Smaller amounts keep you high for longer than the other ones tried from SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be trying different ones a bit later.

				Tried Jacksticky, c63amg and bcpltd.....wasn&#039;tt disappointed with any of them.<br /><br /><br />Jackstickys product is good stuff, it STINKS and won&#039;t keep you awake for hours after use. The recent test results saying it contains levamisole is a huge disappointment. But I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth making a order if you&#039;re willing to wash it yourself. The batch I got was ordered towards the end of December so maybe it was a different batch but who knows....Nobody can say for certain. However I know this vendor has good stuff especially for the price<br /><br />c63amg&#039;s product is a questionable too some degree but certainly does the job and is worth the money for his/their overall service. The new batch is a lot better, maybe the sample i received is different to what he sends out in bigger orders or maybe it&#039;s exactly the same. Either way, his product will please almost everyone, dno&#039;t expect &#039;pure uncut crystal&#039; as advertised, but expect a product you should be happy. Unless you are searching for the BEST quality.<br /><br />BCPLTD product is a little strange........again, it certainly does the job....but i suspect some kind of RC cut as it does get you very &#039;tweaked out&#039; if used for more then a few hours. It has a much strong cocaine taste that you look for but I begun to notice other side effects then should be expected be just using cocaine.<br />

				Just want to give props to vendor WhiteyFord. For any Canadian buyers who want to buy domestic, I&#039;d say he&#039;s your best bet. Good gear for the price you pay, most of the stuff on SR is so expensive, this is at least the most economical of choices.

				I&#039;ve got stuff from Lloydsbrothers a couple of times, the first time it was really good and the second time it was a bit too speedy for my liking. For the price I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s that great, I can get similar quality stuff on the street for half of the price.

				Guys i&#039;m a new vendor, and i&#039;m not trying to brag, but if you buy from me you will never feel the need to buy from others again. I have very very high quality stuff, One small bump gives you this huge euphoria with body tingles, yummy!<br />I&#039;m trying to promote myself, i&#039;m confident that no one will be dissapointed, and as soon as i get a bit popular, i&#039;m sure i will be on your no 1 list.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to visit my vendor link!<br /><br />Try my coke, it&#039;s amazing! <br /><br />FREE SAMPLES to anywhere, in the world, PM me for a link to purchase a free sample (and free shipping too) !

				I&#039;ve sold blow here in the past, and I&#039;m sorry to say it was not as good as I expected. When I bring it back, it will be washed and if that leaves enough fish-scale to profit well, I&#039;ll continue providing it. My previous venture was embarrassing, so samples will be provided.

				Hey everyone, just wanted to advise you all that we sell coke on the Road. We carry top of the line coke once removed from its source of origin and we have super fast shipping. Our prices may be a little high but when you try the coke you&#039;ll understand why that is. We&#039;ve had many return clients in our short time here and all our reviewers seem to think we&#039;ve got the &quot;good shit&quot;.<br /><br />Check out our profile page here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/de05bf8f6c<br /><br />or just search &quot;Magic Moments&quot; on the forums and see what others are saying about us.<br /><br />Magic

				Just thought I would add my experience so far with Coke on SR.....<br />Basically I used to take street coke but stopped couple of years ago as it was just rubbish for the money<br />Iv only been on SR for 2 weeks or so but I dived straight in and coke wise here what I have.......<br />1. ordered 1g from Frank Mathews due to his reviews etc - still waiting on the package thats been 14 days.....very poor comms dont know whats happening<br />2. Sonicdrone = ordered and received good service, domestic mail, To be honest I thought the gram I bought wasnt any better than street stuff but I bought a gram of his 6bitcoins roughly, he now has higher quality coke at double the price 11bitcoins per g, so in hindsight I rushed that one a bit but for the price of 6-7 bitcoins its still a lot of money for not the best of coke but fair play the service is their. Would recommend getting his higher priced coke if buying from Sonic although I havent tried it, the cheaper stuff wasnt worth it. A half G of better quality would have been better than a full G of the lesser- was still advertised as dynamite etc so expected better<br />3. Having now went on the forum I have put in an order with Budworx as they seem to get good reviews- costing plenty for a gram but should be old skool........I hope<br /><br />Always keen to try other stuff thats out there went with budworx as in the same country but I&#039;m desperate to try some stuff from overseas,&nbsp; dutch, usa, anywhere!<br />New Italian Mafia might be receiving a half G order to test it out!<br />Will report on the budworx gear - cant wait, and hopefully Frank will get my order sorted <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Review of Bungee54 C:<br /><br />It took some time to receive sample, but it is a fault of a local post. <br /><br />Stealth was good enough, the envelope was slightly open on one side (which happens quite often here) but nothing was missing.<br /><br />Once opened goods, you could feel straight away nice strong scent of good C (though at the beginning was a bit strange, but maybe because of S around). C was a bit overweight, which is very good :)<br /><br />The C had very nice white color, you could see it shining, but it had strange consistency and I spotted some black and yellowish dust(nothing big). It was easy to cut with a razor.<br /><br />Water test: all dissolved in just above 1 minute<br /><br />Finger test: nice and oily, quickly dissolved<br /><br />After rubbing into gums, you can feel small numbing effect which comes slowly and keeps quite long.<br /><br />Started doing C around 6:30 pm with friend by trying small lines (match size) - got my teeth numb! <br /><br />C is veeeeeeery smooth for nose (no burning), you can feel effects after 10 minutes only! There is no urge to redose! We were doing slightly bigger lines and finished around 2am.<br /><br />Product is very nice, giving euphoric and energetic feeling and putting into talkative mood. No speedy effect at all, I&#039;ve fallen asleep around 2-3 hours after last bump. However, noses of us both got clogged and because of that the next day wasn&#039;t very pleasant and I would say this is the only disadvantage of the C.<br /><br />I tried almost all recommended UK vendors and must say that Bungee54 has very nice C at very good price. Spent lovely evening. I enjoyed C a bit better that my friend (picky one;) ), but can definitely say that Bungee&#039;s C is in my TOP 3 and at this price range is the best.<br /><br />Will update on S a bit later as haven&#039;t had chance to try.<br /><br />Thank you! Will be back!

				I just had an order come in from The Store. Smelled fucking strong.. looked scaly and promising. <br /><br />I railed two 50 mg lines in each nostril and I was flying. I&#039;ve had plenty of blow now off of here.. this is the best I&#039;ve had. <br /><br />I tried going with Pablos Puro, but he didn&#039;t respond to me for 4 days while my money just sat with him, so I canceled the order and went with a more established vendor ( The Store) when he came back.. <br /><br />The purest blow I get from a buddy, direct from the source.. but it&#039;s a shady connect. <br /><br />The Store as of now is the only vendor I will buy coke from. Oh and it&#039;s from Texas, so you know it&#039;s good shit :D<br />cheers

				Have had decent stuff from Budworx, although he&#039;s very expensive. <br /><br />Last lot from FrankMatthews was very jittery with very little euphoria and couldn&#039;t sleep at all. Still felt shitty the next day. Wondering whether it has some nasty RC in it. Will prob chuck it away and put it down to experience. <br /><br />Gonna give up bothering trying to get decent coke I think.
