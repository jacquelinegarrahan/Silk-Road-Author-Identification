				I ordered a ten strip of the freddys but they havent come yet. I just think its weird that not one person has reviewed the freddys yet but they are so many reviews on the mayans. I&#039;m not worried about scamming cause albion is the king. A review on the freddys would be nice though if anyone has tried them.

				From the looks of Albion&#039;s profile it seems like he had a slew of mail-related issues right around the time he shipped a bunch of the Fat Freddy orders. Many people reporting no-shows and, as you&#039;ve said, this is from The King. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s scamming anyone at all... but I am worried that perhaps the authorities local to him caught on to his stealth. SO many no-shows in such a short period of time is odd... <br /><br />Though maybe it&#039;s just that that day&#039;s batch of mail went a different direction and will eventually circle back to all that ordered. In fact, I&#039;m going to assume the latter. ;) #HopefulOptimist

If it comes that would be awesome though!
