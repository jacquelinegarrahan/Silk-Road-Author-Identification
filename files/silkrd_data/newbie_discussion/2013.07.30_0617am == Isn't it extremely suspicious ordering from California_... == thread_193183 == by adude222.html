				, especially from a place like the Emerald Triangle? All the hot weed sellers ship from California, and it just scares me. I did order weed from Colorodo once (didn&#039;t know before it arrived), which isn&#039;t as bad as CA, but few vendors say where their goods ship from so its hard to pick before ordering. Am I being too cautious, or should I follow my instinct here? I&#039;m thinking about buying a good amount and the penalties for that possession are high. Your thoughts are appreciated.

				Depends on what you think a good amount is. You can fit a QP in a small priority one price box. Tens of thousands are shipped every day through the mail. Yours isn&#039;t going to stand out as long as the vendor did their job with the stealth.&nbsp;

				Shipping to where - somewhere else in the USA?&nbsp; If so, don&#039;t sweat it.&nbsp; Find a buyer with good smell stealth (MBB are a must), and your package will another parcel in the mail.<br /><br />Really... Think of how many packages and letters ship out from California on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp; Even if the proportion of weed being shipped is slightly higher then other states, it is still a miniscule portion of the total postal volume. <br /><br />When considering instincts like this it helps to analyze yourself with the question, &quot;who/what am I afraid of?&quot;&nbsp; In my mind, if you are a domestic buyer that takes reasonable precautions (basically - deal with trustworthy vendors.&nbsp; For unknowns, start small and see how their packaging is), there is very little to be afraid of.&nbsp; Everyone has their own fears, their own dangers based on their situation.&nbsp; Identify yours, take precautions, always have a worst-case plan (I don&#039;t know anything! -stick with that- &quot;my lawyer advised me not to answer questions without them present&quot; is good if you are ever asked more then 2 questions by LE).<br /><br />Basically... I highly doubt it matters what state is market on the return address of your weed shipments...<br /><br />-postrex

				A couple years ago, I ordered an lb of weed from a guy online who told me he had a few couriers in my state. Like a dumbfuck, I didn&#039;t even THINK for a second to consider that my mailman was one of his &#039;couriers&#039;. So, needless to say I was pretty surprised when my mailman dropped off a package from fucking Eureka, CA of all places. At least is made it with no issues, but it was just a priority box stuffed with weed.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />But yeah, getting packages from high drug traffic areas seems risky as hell to me, but apparently there is still a very large success rate.

				Yes.&nbsp; From northern California is suspicious.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever been there then you would know that there is nothing out there but weed.&nbsp; Everyone grows weed.&nbsp; There are more grow shops than fast food places.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing around....&nbsp; Well except for weed.
