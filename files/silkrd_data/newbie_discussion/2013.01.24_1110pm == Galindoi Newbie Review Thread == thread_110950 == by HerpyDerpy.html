				Just received my first order from Galindoi for the sample size (5) galindoi mushroom capsules. Packaging was AMAZING and it got here in only TWO days!!!! Plus there were some bonuses thrown in as well. This is only my 3rd transaction here so I truly appreciate Galindoi going above and beyond for me. Gives me the warm and fuzzies. I got these for a friend who wants do shrooms instead next time we have an acid party, so I will be sure to give a trip report after he takes them.

				My first order was last week.&nbsp; I ordered two things:&nbsp; edibles from Angelina and these shrooms from Galindoi.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a vendor, Galindoi was amazing.&nbsp; I was joking with my friends that it was a better experience than ordering on Amazon.&nbsp; As a new buyer, I was probably annoying.&nbsp; I asked a bunch of questions.&nbsp; Galindoi answered them all and made me feel great about the process.&nbsp; I had tried to cancel my order (long story) but he shipped so damned fast I missed the chance!&nbsp; I got them almost next business day - technically I did if you don&#039;t count MLK as a business day!&nbsp; So he&#039;s like 12 out of 10.<br /><br />As a product, these were amazing.&nbsp; I took 2 the second I got them as I had read about low dosing and plus I just have insanely poor impulse control.&nbsp; Still, the low dose experience was quote enjoyable.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard not to love 5 hours of mild euphoria without any other side effects.&nbsp; Then, two nights ago, I took 10.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been cursed with high tolerance so I edged closer to the large dose (don&#039;t know if 10 is &quot;closer to a large dose&quot; but originally I was only going to take 7).&nbsp; I actually broke open the pills and mixed the ground shrooms with OJ.&nbsp; Fast and easy to get down.&nbsp; Plus an *AMAZING* night.<br /><br />Anyways, thats that
