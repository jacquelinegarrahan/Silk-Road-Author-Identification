				Hey all, <br /><br />I have considered a purchase now for sometime and today I thought yeah why not, only to find that the cheapest I can buy bitcoin is at £70 per coin, I then checked SR to see what price the items I wanted (LSD) were at currently and found that it was approximately 2Bitcoins which is £140<br /><br />Have I miscalculated?<br /><br />Any replies would be most welcome <br /><br />beebles

				You would get a decent amount of LSD for 2BTC. I&#039;m sure you can find a few tabs for far cheaper.<br /><br />By the way, the price of a bitcoin does not affect the price of items on SR. SR prices rise and drop to make the price exactly what the vendor specified. For example:<br /><br />Let&#039;s say 1g of MDMA costs $200 and 1BTC is worth $100, which would make the MDMA worth 2BTC. Then tomorrow the price of a bitcoin rises to $200 per BTC. The MDMA would automatically recalculate it&#039;s price and would now be worth 1BTC.<br /><br />The SR wiki is a good place for information like this. Give it a read before making any purchases :)

				Change your SR settings to show in USD or whatever your currency is, not in BTC.&nbsp; Also, you can buy BTC in fragments so if the price of BTC is $120 and something is $60, you can just but 0.5BTC.&nbsp; BTC price on SR is based off MT. Gox trading average, much easier to see prices in USD than BTC.

				1BTC was £92 three days ago! but like they say,it doesn&#039;t matter on SR because the quantity you get will be the same dollar value.It would only matter if you were buying BTC to sell.So like any other currency-buy low,sell high.
