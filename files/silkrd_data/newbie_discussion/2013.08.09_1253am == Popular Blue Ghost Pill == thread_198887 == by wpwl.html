				My girlfriend and I had them a couple months ago and they were great! They have break lines so we broke ours in half. We each popped a half and came up hard about a half an hour later. Very clean and strong roll, we danced our asses off. We each popped the other half about 90 minutes after the first and continued to roll for several more hours. I have a couple left and I&#039;m definitely looking forward to round two!

				I tried the blue ghosts from vendor &#039;cher&#039; (spain). They were very nice. I posted a review on their thread. You can look back through my posts if you want to see it. I also had a few batches of the green ghost last year. Also very nice, probably the same presser. If you are concerned you should get a test kit.<br /><br />The ones I had though were very clean, pure mdma plus filler. You can test to rule out PMA. Were the Ireland deaths from pills with PMA?&nbsp; Either way you can tell qith a test.

				I&#039;ve ate plenty of those biscuits .. best press Ireland has had in years, really nice buzz from them. Had the green ones too and in my opinion they are clean and nice but no way are they as strong as the blue ones.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also had the Green Rolexes you mentioned above in Ireland both recently and years ago<br />Years ago: out of it! buzzed around the place for the whole night<br />Recently: started to hallucinate really weird things (looking at a forest from a distance and the forest just disappears) starting panicing on these pills couldn&#039;t finish my sentences because I kept forgetting where I was, terrible time!! as far as I&#039;m concerned I&#039;m lucky to be alive.<br /><br />^just goes to show how different a press can be with different batches which kind of has me thinking how long until the Blue Ghosts become adulterated
