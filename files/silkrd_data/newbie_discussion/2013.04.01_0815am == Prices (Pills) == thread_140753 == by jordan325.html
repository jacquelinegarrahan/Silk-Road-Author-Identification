				Greetings to my fellow SR&#039;s... I am a newbie and have been doing some window shopping and learning of my new found candy store.&nbsp; However.... I am kind of shocked of the prices... I found this site after some very difficult research when my local candy store suppliers were out of candy.&nbsp; I thought maybe when I found this new candy store (SR) that there would be many more bargains for me.&nbsp; However I feel like the prices I am paying through my local stores are much cheaper then here.<br />Am I just lucky??? <br />I have found a few bargains here if I would happen to take a chance... But they are &#039;bulk&quot; purchases and know one really wants to mess with a &quot;newbie&quot; on purchases like that.<br />Guess I have to earn my stay.

				At least here you have a review mechanism and the ability to claim your money back if you go with the rules.<br /><br />Have a look in my listings and we could discuss what exactly do you need.<br /><br />
