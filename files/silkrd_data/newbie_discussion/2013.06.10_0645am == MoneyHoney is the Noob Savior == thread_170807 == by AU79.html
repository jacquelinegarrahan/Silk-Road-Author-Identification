				This is by far the easiest and most convenient process of getting Bitcoins . MoneyPak is the way to go , these cards can be found at any local Walgreens or you can use a Store locator to find a different store . Moneypak is essentially impossible to trace , no signing up or anything , completely confidential and quick ! If you are aware of MoneyPak , you already know how easy it is to convert cash to online accounts and services such as PayPal .&nbsp; If you don&#039;t know what MoneyPak is : You pay any desired amount towards purchasing the card , then the card holds the value of the amount of cash you spent . Then you simply scratch off the silver portion with a coin just as you would scratch off a Lottery card and WALA , an embedded code is revealed . MoneyHoney will exchange Bitcoins for the Codes ( and the value they hold of course ) . He has a flawless rep going so far ! Here is his page :<br /><br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/609fdf0b36/10<br />

				Fees aren&#039;t that bad . . the card only cost $5 itself and his charge is similar to the other service providers .

				I second MoneyHoney.&nbsp; I used him/her for the first time just the other day.&nbsp; I was nervous at first because I didn&#039;t want to lose my deposit.&nbsp; But everything went smooth.&nbsp; Just give him/her some time to get the bitcoins to you.&nbsp; Some people on feedback said it took 5 minutes, some people it took a couple hours, for me it took about 6-7 hours and I was getting nervous right around that point but it all worked out.&nbsp; You&#039;re look at a $5 fee for the moneypak and a 5% fee from moneyhoney.&nbsp; I used bitinstant many times before but went with moneyhoney since bitinstant was down for cash deposits (and still is at this moment).&nbsp; Bitinstant does have lower fees, but there have been instances that I&#039;ve read about where someone was trying to deposit a substantial amount of cash and bitinstant never came through for them.&nbsp; While that probably isn&#039;t likely to happen, like someone else said you should still use moneyhoney because you don&#039;t have to fill out the stupid moneygram form like you would with bit instant and put down all the bogus information.&nbsp; Moneypak cards are just easier and quicker.&nbsp;

				Although I just went to moneyhoneys page and moneyhoney doesn&#039;t have any active listings at this time.&nbsp; No big deal I wasn&#039;t looking to buy right at the moment, but hopefully this is temporary.&nbsp; Maybe he/she needs to restock bitcoins or is concerned about the crazy changes we&#039;ve been seeing with bitcoin prices in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;
