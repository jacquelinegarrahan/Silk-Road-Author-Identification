				Hi rhea.. well i have a local connection, but he stopped selling crack and only sells powder coke. I tried to wash it myself&nbsp; but I don&#039;t get a lot back for the amount of money I spent. When&nbsp; I purchased from marlostansfiled.. I got a great deal&nbsp; &nbsp;which was the same or more than I would have received off the street I don&#039;t have any other connects. Any safe way u can recommedn I get a street connection? .. plus do I want to risk getting arrested, or killed in addition to being ripped off.. I just need to never fe&nbsp; and buy from a good vendor&nbsp; &nbsp;thats why i posted this thread.<br /><br />So.... back to my request.... need reliable vendor for crack that ships to the Us<br />.<br />Regards,<br />.<br />clpicard
