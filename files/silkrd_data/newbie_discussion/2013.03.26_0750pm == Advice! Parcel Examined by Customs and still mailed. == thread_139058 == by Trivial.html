				About 2 months ago an eighth of Golden teachers was mailed from canada to U.S. It got seized in customs apparently and now they just passed it through. I was using a different name back then and address. <br />Just came in the mail today. With green tape that says EXAMINED BY CUSTOMS and the mushrooms are still in the letter. What is the best course of action?

				Maybe they assumed they were dried edible mushrooms, it&#039;s unlikely they would have been delivered if customs had suspected them to be illegal. <br />There are many posts about controlled deliveries on the forums.

				Hrmm maybe I didn&#039;t specify correctly. They found the mushrooms the tape is around the vacuum sealed bag that was cut open. Of course the mushrooms will be eaten!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Just wondering if I should worry about heat on that address?

				You had it sent to a drophouse under a fake name so they&#039;re not gonna bust down your door.<br />Couldn&#039;t hurt to use a new address and name for future shipments though.<br />So strange that they inspected , then delivered?!?

				Get a marker and write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on it.<br />Keep it unopened for a few days.<br />Then relax and enjoy.
