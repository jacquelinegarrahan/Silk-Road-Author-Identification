				I&#039;ve read in a few places that smoking makes dreaming impossible for a few days after. However if I smoke a few spliffs of a day it guarantees me a dream that night and it makes my lucid dreams even more vivid. The dreams usually occur between 4-5AM after smoking about 12 hours previously and going to bed aaround 10PM. However I only get this effect from certain strains and unfortunately never got the names of them. Surprisingly the best one for this effect has been some shitty Mex that I bought to build trust with a new dealer. Honestly I&#039;d buy it again just for that unless I find another suitable strain to cultivate. From my best guess it was at least 30% Sativa as well as the other strains that have done it, which I know for a fact had some strong Sativa genetics. I also know it&#039;s not dependent upon higher THC content. Anyone else have experiences like this? Know of any strains that might do it for me?

				it sounds like youre just looking for a nice sativa strain, to give you that nice cerebral fade. I recommend sativa wax if you can find it

				A lot of the information on the way THC effects the brain suggests it has a both negative and positive effect on dreaming. Hence, it is down to the individual. <br />THC in itself is technically classed as a hallucinogen, and from experience if i sleep on other hallucinogens i either have an amazingly vivid lucid dream, or i dont remember shit. I think the same can be said about THC because i have the same sort of thing from smoking. Sometimes dreams, sometimes not.<br />Other cannibinoids in the cannbis plant, mainly sativa as mentioned before, cause very nice and vivid dreams down to the cerebral high. However indica tends to be knock out sleep state where the brain to be seems like its deactivated lol.<br />Eating sativa cheeba chews usually bring about a pretty intense dream when i finally decide its time to sleep, and its a really nice high.<br /><br />Best way for you would be to experiment, keep a dream journal, and find the ideal strain and/or method that gets you the desired results as its the only conclusive method.<br /><br />Peace and have fun, maybe learn meditation and lucid dreaming and then you wont even need the drugs ( despite how fun they are) to have a great time sleeping. <br /><br />Astrona

				If you are looking for something to effect your dreams, check out mugwort. Sounds like some witch brew/potion shit, but it&#039;s actually cheap and works really well. just my 2 cents or 0.00018 BTC...

I used to meditate all the time but I can&#039;t really anymore. I fucked up my knee and I can&#039;t sit on it right since it doesn&#039;t have full range of movement, but I have to sit on my legs to keep the urge to move them from getting the better of me. Plus I have mild insomnia and I&#039;m no good at forcing myself to dream. Smoking helps with all of that stuff. One of the reasons I picked it up in the first place. I do keep a dream journal and do all that but the most luck I&#039;ve had is medicating and meditating. I&#039;ve noticed that Indica does prevent dreaming. Whenever I smoked verifiable Indica strains I noticed that it didn&#039;t happen, unfortunately Indica is way more popular especially with my buddies. Admittedly, NL is my favorite strain so I can&#039;t complain.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157020.msg1102352#msg1102352">Quote from: MasterKief on May 08, 2013, 12:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it sounds like youre just looking for a nice sativa strain, to give you that nice cerebral fade.

Never thought about the waxes much but I know how potent they are. Since I want the experience I&#039;ll definitely get a wax because I&#039;m not primarily looking to enjoy the smoke. I&#039;m eventually planning on getting some Jamaican seeds on vacation and from what I&#039;ve seen they have really good sativa.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157020.msg1102524#msg1102524">Quote from: nameless131313 on May 08, 2013, 12:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you are looking for something to effect your dreams, check out mugwort.

Any listings for it on SR? I don&#039;t usually touch anything besides weed. I am looking to do Ayahuasca but that&#039;s essentially it for psychedelics that I&#039;ll do.

				I believe it is just a ground root, do some googleing. It is completely legal as it only effects your dreams, but you smoke it, preferably through a bong, then go to bed. Some people say it works if you just sleep with it under your pillow, but I&#039;m personally convinced that&#039;s placebo. Check it out though. Anybody else heard of/done it??
