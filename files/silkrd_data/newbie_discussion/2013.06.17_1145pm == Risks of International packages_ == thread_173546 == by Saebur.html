				So are there chances of you being raided if your international package gets intercepted?<br />Or they simply just take the package and burn it? Or do they actually look into where these are headed to and stuff? I want to purchase something from the uk but I&#039;m from usa but I&#039;m afraid that if it gets intercepted, then I&#039;m going to raided or something of the sorts.<br /><br />Personal experiences would be appreciated. What happened when your packages got compromised?

				as someone who deals primarily overseas (europe and asia shipping to USA), I can say a few things:<br />UK is not anything to be worried about. the problem countries (from what ive seen) are the Netherlands and China. <br />specifically packages that are heavy.&nbsp; any package over 500g (half kilo) will be inspected much more closely.&nbsp; So if possible, stay away from those 2 countries (esp when dealing in larger weights, or high amounts of pills) and you should be fine.&nbsp; most packages when coming from some place that is not considered a &quot;drug producing country&quot; pass through in 2-3 days, with no problems whatsoever.&nbsp; the vendor should also realize the package is going through customs, and to take the proper precautions when creating it.

				Worst case is a nice form letter.<br /><br />Depending on the country/state/county it might even invite you to go down to your local federal office if you believe that the &#039;illegal contraband&#039; was confiscated in error.
