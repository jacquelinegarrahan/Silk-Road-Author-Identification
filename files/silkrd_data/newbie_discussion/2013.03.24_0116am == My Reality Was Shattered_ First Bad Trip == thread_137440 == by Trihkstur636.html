				Hello experienced trippers,<br /><br />I need all the advice I can get in order to cope with a severely traumatizing experience I <br />went through four days ago during my first bad LSD trip.<br /><br />I dont want to go into details as to what I went through, as I&#039;m sure many have<br />had many similar experiences during bad trips.<br /><br />All I need is some guidance, how have others dealt with<br />the aftermath of such a reality shattering experience.<br /><br />Should I ever drop again?&nbsp; :-\

				What were the general circumstances? With friends/by yourself, in the city/in the country, indoors/outdoors, bad mood start/good mood start <br />anyone around that was experienced with psychedelics?<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a bad trip on LSD, but was very experienced with mushrooms before trying it out. Ate too many boomers once and sat in my car by trying to calm myself down for a while then a more experienced friend sat with me and gently calmed me down and assured me everything was okay. After that I began to come down to a more manageable level and it ended up turning out to be a great trip.<br /><br />Even when you&#039;re in a bad place with the right guidance you can usually end up turning it around. The right music can really help too. The wrong music can, well....

				my last trip was a really weird/bad long-ass 3.5 hours and i&#039;ve been overwhelmed but not as uncomfortable before so i&#039;m just going to try some mdma if not mda (and maybe a LOW dose of LSD or 2cb as a kicker)<br /><br />i told myself i would never trip again but i think i&#039;ll just stay away from the nbome&#039;s and i still want to try LSD as i have not yet<br /><br />what i&#039;ve learned so far is to not trip when i&#039;m going to get really tired and do plenty of loosening up physically

				For some reason sometimes I have trips on acid where I think everyone around me is plotting against me. I hate the paranoid vibe. Usually happens when I&#039;m around people that aren&#039;t tripping. The best trips I&#039;ve ever had was just me and 1 other person. Groups of people always fuck up my trips.

				DONT STOP TRIPIN!<br /><br />trippin is one of very special moments that very few people throughout human history have experienced.<br /><br />take it slower maybe take a break for a while from trippin but dont stop altogether<br /><br />psychadellics can be used as medicine too!!!!<br /><br />PS takin a few minutes to calm down and roll and smoke my own joint usually alone has saved me from a bad trip more than once <br />that process of rolling and smokin some weed really calms you down and gets ya thinkin on a more normal curious path <br />and ive heard benzos help with bad trips<br /><br />good luck with your decisions! do whatever yu feel is most comfrotable for you but i hope you dont stop becuase of how great it is!

				The trip was great at first I dropped around 5pm and felt good for a good 8+ hours <br />I was having a blast feeling awesome, and these tabs were the strongest ive had<br />intense visuals...<br /><br />around 4:30 am.. things went for the worse... Out of nowhere I go to turn off my tv and &quot;go to sleep&quot;<br />And a powerful energy entered my body, I screamed in panic and jumped on top off my girlfriend begging for help<br /><br />I was having a full on panic attack, the visuals were so fucking powerful reality was completely<br />incomprehensible... I felt like I was dying, like my body was taking over by a demon,<br />Time was meaningless I felt insane, like I would trip for REST of my life... <br />Tried to open my eyes to make sense of the world but all I saw was complete distortion,<br />my heart was pounding, I had shortness of breath.. I was scared for my fucking life...<br /><br />I was even thinking of calling the ambulance, but felt that would not have been any better...<br />I even contemplated jumping out of the window, having weird thoughts..<br /><br />I had gave two other tabs to my other friends girl and boy.. they left my house around 3:45 am<br />I had fears that my friend was going to stab her, or that she would go insane and kill herself..<br /><br />it was completely fucking terrible terrifying hellish experience of my life<br />Nothing can ever compare to that<br /><br />I have many theories as to why this may have occurred; I had work the next day, and was unsure of calling out because I had to take my friend to work<br />&nbsp;(responsibility was fucking with me), lack of rest, general stress, i invited two other people over my house...<br />but my point is I have dropped before with all that stuff going on but I never had a bad trip like this... So Idk why this time it happened...<br /><br />I drop acid so i can escape from all that stress and ego bullshit.. and I was having a great time untill about 8 hours later..<br />and can I also mention that this trip lasted unusually longer too, im guessing bad trips are longer?<br />I woke up at 7 still tripping balls! wtf!<br /><br />If I ever trip again im going to prepare immensely for it and treat it with the utmost respect, and plan two days around it,<br />perhaps go into nature? LSD has shown me its dark power as well as its beauty... How do I know it wont turn on me ?&nbsp; :o :&#039;( :-X&nbsp; ???

				Maybe something crazy REALLY did happen, and the LSD just opened the door for it. I have a friend that was on shrooms and some kind of shadowy thing was looming over him and the other 2 people there both saw it. He couldn&#039;t see it but said he could feel it&#039;s presence. He tears up every time he talks about.it.

				I&#039;ve had a few experiences like that.&nbsp; Usually it&#039;s because I&#039;m mentally stressed or I &quot;casually&quot; enter into a trip without preparing properly for what can be a very intense experience.&nbsp; The key is to make sure you show enough reverence and respect for what you&#039;re about to do.&nbsp; Instead of using it as an escape from life, look at it as a priveledge and a celebration of life.&nbsp; Remember that it&#039;s a teacher, you are the student.&nbsp; Remain calm and try to take in as much as it wants to show you. <br />I think you&#039;re right-on when you say you should plan a couple days around it.&nbsp; I agree with jackofspades, don&#039;t stop tripping!!! <br />When the paranoia and panic set in, just breathe and remember the universe loves you.&nbsp; Trust in it.&nbsp; Everything will be ok.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Also try to surround yourself with others who have experience, they can usually talk you through it or help you snap out of it.&nbsp; Anyone who has had a bad trip knows how shitty and alone one might feel, so most are willing to help get you out of a negative thought loop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also with time you&#039;ll start identifying negative thought patterns in yourself and others and figure out creative ways to change them.&nbsp; That&#039;s the fun part.&nbsp; Hope this helps, just remember you&#039;re not alone and you&#039;re doing great.&nbsp; You should be proud of yourself for getting through a tough one ;)

				Ive had a number of bad trips, but they werent all the same. Some of just overwhelming and you think you&#039;re going to die, but these are just cyclical panic attacks. Others are bad in that they are negative, just bad energy floating around, mostly psychological and who you&#039;re with. Some just happen when you close your eyes and get trapped in your mind, the best way to avoid a bad trip is to go out into nature and away from it all.

				I always enjoyed LSD way back when, I remember my first trip on a half tab of golden dragon and playing zelda for snes, me and my friend was laughing for 40 mins straight over this sound from walking in water..I never laughed that hard over some stupid puddle sound...I also always made sure I was never tripping alone and tripping with the right people with the right surroundings. Tripping alone even if you&#039;re with others but if their not on it with you it can create some some bad things if you&#039;re not experienced. I remember a friend of mine decided to drop a tab with some of his friends, well giving that it was a school night they ended things early and he went home. I remember receiving a call from his grandma and I could hear him screaming in the back ground...I rushed over there to try and see what&#039;s going on..As I pull up to the apt there&#039;s 4 squad cars and an ambulance...Some neighbors called the police because of the noise..Speaking to him the following day, he just wigged out..HE was telling me that he had this thought in his head that someone was trying to break into his room and kill him..He couldn&#039;t shake that feeling and the sounds he was hearing (The sounds were from a TV in the next room)..it got to the point that he was so scared he started breaking down his wall trying to find a way out of his room...I took him home that day and checked out his room and WOW his room was trashed.....After that day he was a different person, to most they can&#039;t see it but to those who are close to him can see it.. Something like that scars you for life and till this day I still talk to him and notice he has panic attacks from time to time and I can see anxiety sometimes when we&#039;re out.<br /><br />Dealing with what happened to you, it&#039;s probably on your mind a lot and that&#039;s normal but, it will pass. If it gets to the point where it&#039;s stressing you out talk to someone with experience on LSD or someone who&#039;s been through it or even your GF since she was there..Just talking about it and getting it out helps to comfort and release those thoughts....The more you dwell on what happened and trying to figure it out the more time it&#039;s going to take to move on, very small doses of xanies helps a lot. In any case, I wouldn&#039;t touch any LSD, shrooms, DMT again...That bad trip scars you and tripping is so unpredictable, the thought of the bad trip will come to thought and mess with my trip from fear of happening again..But, if you decide to go on that road again, don&#039;t trip alone or with sober people, and make sure to trip with people who are fun to be around...Laughing and talking keeps your mind from drifting.. <br /><br />Good luck man!

				If you don&#039;t mind.. could you give any detail about your bad trip at all? See i&#039;m about to take some Salvia Divinorium.. it&#039;s supposedly the most potent stuff there is but it only lasts about 3 minutes. I&#039;ve been wanting to try LSD for years but could never get my hands on it until i found this site. See, i do suffer from emotional/psychological problems and i get disturbed very easily. I&#039;m scared to try it but i&#039;ve been thinking about it/researching it for years and i feel like i&#039;m ready now.. i&#039;m scared that i will have an experience i will be permanently traumatised by. I do have alot of phobias as well.. i am afraid they might appear in my trips and if i knew they would beforehand then i probably won&#039;t touch the stuff at all. Can you shed some light on what your trip was about and why it has affected you, please? it would really help me somewhat and maybe you by talking about it, thanks.

				Psychedelics are not something to be taken lightly. They are not a &quot;party&quot; drug. Anyone who wants to use a psychedelic compound needs to do a lot of research into what there embarking on before they have the experience. I always suggest people to work there way up the psychedelic ladder before just diving into the deep end. Start with smoking some salvia, move on to some mild doses of psilocybin, and gradually work your way up. There is a huge misconception that compounds like LSD are designed to have a good time with. A psychedelic experience should be well thought out, prepare an intent, set the environment, and do a lot of mental work beforehand. Go into it with a purpose. You say it &quot;shattered your reality&quot;. Well that&#039;s kind of the point. It&#039;s designed to change you, change your point of view, change your view of reality. It sounds like you didn&#039;t do enough preparation beforehand. Don&#039;t panick, don&#039;t fight it, just try and relax and you will start feeling better. The next time you do it, spend more time beforehand preparing yourself.

				Don&#039;t get me wrong, to me psychedelics were absolutely personality-changing for the better and I am an open-minded person to begin with, but I think the seriousness with which LSD trips must be approached is lore. The first time I took acid was at a Furthur concert, and I had an amazing time. In fact I had no idea what psychedelics were really capable of until I started tripping at shows (I&#039;ve done shrooms as &quot;serious trips&quot; many times before then). Of course set and setting are still the most important, but rather than explicitly entering my mind I was using psychedelics to listen to music in ways I never have before, dance in ways I never have before, talk to people in ways I never have before. Shrooms and LSD are totally fun drugs that can be conducive to partying. Salvia is way scarier than any trip I&#039;ve ever taken on either of those. <br /><br />edit: though I agree with you from another thread that LSD is not for &#039;getting crunk&#039;, its specific brand of partying is still very introspective and meaningful.

				To be honest I&#039;m pretty cowardly guy if it when it concerns psychedelics which means I&#039;m afraid to take a lot of substance to go really deep.&nbsp; I had about 7 experiences with lsd, which I can not really call experiences, the dosage was quite high though. For example when I took 5 drops I could drive a motorcycle pretty well and the psychological side of the trip was quite shallow if not just nothing. And a guy who ingested the same drop from the same vial with me tripped at least twice harder as I can judge and I could and I was easily able to take care of him. There were two other people who I tripped with and the effect&nbsp; on them and me was quite proportional to the case I&#039;ve described. What I&#039;m trying to say here is that I somehow seem to be naturally tolerant to lsd, and it&#039;s just lsd, all other psychedelics even triptamines such as mushrooms, dmt and even lsa, sometimes give me even stronger effect then I can expect form the dose, and I also feel much noticeable thoughts catalyzing effect, than on lsd, but as I said I never took a heavy dose that can possibly disconnect me from the reality and plunge me really or some deep into unconscious. That&#039;s why I can not be a professional adviser here. <br />Many of the trip reports I read here don&#039;t seem to be describing&nbsp; things really self-transformating and profound. And as I personally believe psychedelics in descent doses is a thing which should. I personally support the theory of Stanislav Grof, though I can confirm it from my own experience with psychedelics only partly. It&#039;s a bit surprising for me that this name is never mentioned on these forums, despite of the quite wide discussion of lsd and psychedelics. This man conducted the research of lsd in clinical environment for something like 10 years before it became prohibited by law. Later he developed a method of holotropic breathing(breathwork) which he says can work the same way as lsd and help a person plunge into his unconscious. I tried several times and it has never worked for me, but I personally know a person for whom it worked(i was his sitter). It&#039;s important to mention here that the point of both psychedelic therapy and holotropic breathing is either to help the person solve some problems which are hidden in his unconscious by the biological mechanisms of psyche protection or to gain some profound knowledge of the world and consciousness in general. At least I see is this way. From the point of this theory there are no bad trips there are just things in your unconscious or the collective unconscious which you can encounter and ought to deal with if you go this path. I&#039;m not sure there is a way to avoid this experience if you continue to ingest lsd and not to face the same thing which you described again. I believe you should take some lsd in proper circumstances, having a sitter who you can rely on, and just deal with the things happening. It can be extremely scary or difficult but I guess is&#039;t the only possibility and also the rewarding possibility. From what you have described it looks like the second or third perinatal matrix if we speak about it in terms of Grof, which is reexperiencing the stage of birth when the womb contracts and the fetus feels pressure, lack of oxygen, fear of death, the world seems fake, thing can seem flat, the ground seems to be taken under from the persons feet etc. I believe it&#039;s not possible to die from the intensity of experience whatever happens, so if you try to go through that, I guess you should not worry. You can feel like you are dieing but it will be only ego-death. <br />I speak mostly from theory not from my experience because till the current moment I have never that much courage to go really deep into experience. But if something I wrote makes sense to you you can read the book &quot;The realms of human unconscious&quot; by Grof. It&#039;s about his investigations of lsd. If something changes in your situation for better or worse hope you write about it in this thread. <br />Sorry everyone for my english it can be confusing periodically. Hope everyone gets me clearly though.

				I&#039;ve had many of what people consider &quot;bad&quot; trips but I never saw them that way. I always learned something from them and the really bad (as in seemingly evil, dark etc.) one where those that are the most instructive if you learn certain things (that are too long to explain here).<br /><br />The only really bad trip (in the real sense, I consider bad only those experience that gives you nothing in return) I had was out of DMT, but not for the DMT but for the use. It was the first times of using &quot;the machine&quot; and I didn&#039;t know that after a while a kind of resin sticks in it and this gives a total different experience (much more similar to 5-MEO-DMT). I simply wasn&#039;t prepared and the resin was a lot (I did an error the night before and so almost all of the DMT was left in there in resin), so the effect was really, really hard. My heart rate jumped to astronomical levels and I didn&#039;t have any of the effects I usually experienced with DMT (the flavor of the smoke, the type of effect, the visual aspect and so on) so I was totally confused and couldn&#039;t orientate myself. These are the only kind of trips I consider bad, because you are completely clueless of what&#039;s happening and so you have no modus operandi on which to learn something from it. After that experience I tried 5-MEO-DMT in the proper way and could understand better what happened but at the moment the experience was much more on the physical side than anything else.
