				I recently purchased a single blotter from fartbomber, I had a ez test ehrlich so I cut the tab in half thinking 105mikes would still feel very nice, Unfortunately There was no reaction from the reagent and I took the other half and got no effect from it. I am on moclobemide which does reduce the activity of lsd makes it less strong, so maybe that&#039;s why I had no effect. But no reagent reaction as well makes me wonder if there was any L on the blotter, Maybe a corner blot that never got dipped whatever. Or perhaps fartbomber has accidentally taken on a duff batch of blotter and doesn&#039;t yet realise it, it was only last week that I took the half tab. I&#039;m not pointing fingers and calling names, just wondering out loud what might have gone wrong,. Any ideas anyone?

				Did you wait for the ball in the EZ test to dissolve? I know their manual says there should be a reaction within 1-2 minutes but in reality you have to wait till the ball dissolves for the reaction to happen. Im going to do a EZ test right now and will post back results.<br /><br />update: The EZ test reacted to a purple hue

I took one a couple weeks ago and tripped hard. I have ordered from fartbomber multiple times and its always been good. I would say that the medication you are on must be why it wasn&#039;t a strong tip for you, because even a half tab would have got me tripping.<br /><br />It sucks to have that happen, and I would be upset too but Fartbomber is a very honest vendor IMHO, and there are a lot of good reviews of these tabs too. Maybe wait until you are off the meds then try again? Best of luck when you do. LSD is a life changing drug.
