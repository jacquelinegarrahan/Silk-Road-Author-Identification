				i&#039;d like to place small orders from several vendors for the same product, instead of risking getting burned in one big order. but one small order at a time won&#039;t get me through to the next one, so i&#039;d like to order a bunch at once. but then how will i know who each package came from? should i ask the vendors to put a clue in the package, or would that make me look suspicious and get me blacklisted? advice appreciated!

				The best bet is to order same product but in different amounts order 1g here and 2g there, I wouldnt be asking vendors to mark the package in any way<br /><br />Im not sure where you are or what your ordering but most places can get next day delivery if you order early and pay for express thats what i do&nbsp;

				I personally am a bit wary to have multiple orders arrive at the same time, because I think it reduces plausible deniability: If one package is intercepted, it is easy to maintain you have no idea where it came from. However, if more packages are delivered the next day, things may become more difficult to explain. I am by no means a lawyer though, so maybe this is just paranoia. And of course, in the case of small orders, the chances of interception are very low. <br /><br />And my idea is: if I am consuming more than I get delivered by placing the next order as soon as the previous order arrives, I should probably cut down a bit :-)<br /><br />That said, I also wouldn&#039;t ask the vendor, and Feesh suggestions are very good.

				Im not sure why people think if one package is intersepted with there name on it they can deny it but 2 they cant wouldnt you just use the same story of someones using my name and mailbox?&nbsp; I would
