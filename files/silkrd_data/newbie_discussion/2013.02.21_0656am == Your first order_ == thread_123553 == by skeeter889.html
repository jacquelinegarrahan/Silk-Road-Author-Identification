				Hi,<br /><br />&nbsp; total noob, 0 orders, first post. <br /><br />I&#039;ve just had my first order cancelled by AfghanApothecary. Was having a look hoping it would be here tomorrow. (It was kinda important too...)&nbsp; I started small (1g amphet. sulph), have funds, pgp&#039;d address... what did I do wrong. On his vendors page (yes, i checked) there was no mention of minimum transactions to order.<br /><br />He&#039;s the only amphetamine sulph guy here.. apart from mrmerlin25 (who&#039;s pages I love, messaged him but then funds appeared and AA was only non stealth offer) <br /><br />How&#039;s a dude meant to get off the ground in here? <br /><br />Thanks in advance for any tips...&nbsp; &nbsp;have one whole btc on here, back at 3:30pm GMT, if anyone could help i&#039;d be their bitch hehehhe<br /><br />Skeet

				I&#039;m obviously a noob too, but if I were you, I would very carefully re-read the vendor&#039;s page and the product&#039;s page and be damn sure I followed all directions properly.<br /><br />Maybe you paid for the wrong shipping or used a fake name... I dunno.<br />After that I&#039;d ask the vendor why he cancelled.<br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Hi Mate,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did he have a certain amount of transactions needed before he would deal with&nbsp; you?Should be in his thread if he is onto it.Try to find someone who welcomes newbies.Sounds as though you have don&#039;t everything correct.It&#039;s pretty sick when you get first or any order in post.Not so sick when LE gets it.

				Read the vendor page first.&nbsp; Then I&#039;d say it&#039;s good practice if you&#039;re new to send vendor&#039;s a message before buying.&nbsp; Most of them are cool and you can get a good sense of their availability and response times this way which can help assuage your fears before dealing with them.&nbsp; Also they will let you know any special requirements they might have for new buyers.

				I had the same thing happen to me on my first order. A lot of vendors will cancel a newbie&#039;s order if they are low on stock in order to fulfill the ones with more established history. It was hit and miss, but now I have 8 transactions under my belt and no more problems with that. I would private message the vendor either before or along with your order, just to establish communication with them and so they know you are a serious buyer and that will better your chances. Good luck! :)

				Well, my first order was from this vendor; Karmapharm.<br />His shit was good.&nbsp; And his shit was cheap.&nbsp; I tried to give him&nbsp; a review on his forum review page but i guess new guys cant post there. I want to buy as much of his product as I can afford, because I can make Sooo much money off of it. But alas, he never has anything in stock and I&#039;m afraid that(since his prices are so unbelievable) that buying a large amount could get me sent to jail.&nbsp; Just seems too good to be true.

				As a vendor I guess I have to interject and say what my first sale was.......having almost made the mistake of stating my first buys on my vending account, something I ain&#039;t about to do in case someone with a good head for stats and analysis could work out who I am based on purchases...<br /><br />...Saying that, I believe my very first sale was of two 100mg MST tablets, [morphine sulphate extended release]. The first was a water test by the buyer, and the next day he ordered a couple of 30mg diamorphine ampoules, [pharmaceutical heroin for injection], to which I added a couple more MST, a few Lyrica caps [I think, or the buyer might have said he didn&#039;t want them], they are pregabalin if anyone is intersted- very effective for certain kinds of pain, and have a lovely almost Benzo like anti-anxiety side to them. 5 or 6 is essential baseline stabilisation material for any serious stimulant session, however daily use is to be avoided, they are habit forming, and withdrawal is unpleasant], finally I chucked in a couple of&nbsp; Mirtazapine [extremely sedating anti-depressants], all as a kind of &quot;Thank-you-very-much first customer&quot;. Glad to be of service &amp; very much hope you return.<br /><br />So, that was one side of my noob entry to the Silk Road. I think I will register another identity, and then I can post about my exploits, successes &amp; failures purchasing!.

				My first order was a tab of LSD that never arrived, luckily I had already ordered some MDMA that did arrive. I&#039;d say if I hadn&#039;t received that MDMA I&#039;d have stopped ordering things,safe to say I&#039;m very glad it came :)
