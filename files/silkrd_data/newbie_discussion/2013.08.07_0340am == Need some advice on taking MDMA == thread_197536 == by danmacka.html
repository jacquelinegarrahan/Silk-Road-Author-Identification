				I used xtc around 2008 and had great times the first 5 or 6 times then had a terrible experience when one of the girls we were out with had a seizure, leading me to being hospitalized with severe panic attacks being on the same stuff which we believed after that to be adulterated. I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety ever since I&#039;ve been afraid to try it again since but miss the amazing feeling it gives and think taking it again could even help me conquer it.<br /><br />Anyone got any advice on dosage and method, or should I just steer well clear?<br />

				I don&#039;t really understand what you&#039;re trying to say?&nbsp; it&#039;s like you&#039;re implying that method and dosage will some how have an effect on your experience (a positive or negative one) and I find it hard to believe you could have a negative experience of MDMA unless you overdosed and got serotonin syndrome, which it sounds like your friend did.&nbsp; Was she taking any MAOIs or SSRIs at the time?<br /><br />It sounds like you haven&#039;t taken any for a long time so you&#039;ll probably only need to take around 200-250mg for a nice roll.&nbsp; Personally I find MDMA tastes absolutely disgusting so I prefer to initally bomb/parachute 150mg then snort or gum 50-100mg 2 hours later, if you need to that, dosage really depends on the person, some people can be off their faces on 100mg, I prefer to take about 300-400mg.

				Keep in mind that MDMA IS neurotoxic but don&#039;t let that turn you off. If you wait 2-3 months in between rolls there will be absolutely no damage.<br /><br />MDMA is one of the most physiologically safe drugs out there, just buy it off silk road, sort by bestsellers, buy domestic. You&#039;ll have an awesome time.

				Given your experience, it might be better to start with a lower dosage and work your way up.<br /><br />150 mg is pretty standard, but it might be better to ease toward it with several doses rather than doing the whole thing.

				when I was selling MDMA I had differednt dosages for different situations/desired effects<br /><br />like others said, working your way up might not be a bad idea.. starting at 75mg could be good (that was my &quot;loved up but still capable of givin&#039; lovin&quot; dose :p )

				MDMA is great stuff, I had never tried drugs before taking MDMA (Smoked one joint and hated it), I took 1.5 points and loved it, I took it orally. Since then I&#039;ve tried only MDMA and Speed, and plan on trying cocaine. Nothing other than these though. Just make sure you don&#039;t try and fight the experience, enjoy yourself and socialize alot, MDMA is fantastic to take before going to a night club!
