				My friend got caught with something and ratted me out early spring. I have no idea what he told the cops. All I know is that when he got busted with possession with intent to sell. He got off with a year of probation. He cut all contact with me and when I tried to talk to him he slammed the door in my face. I was providing him with the endowers with out making any profit of it. There is a huge chance that he told them about me and this website. I do not know as a fact though. <br /><br />I&#039;m just curious if it&#039;s generally safe for me to order personal amounts from now on? Or am I going to be on some kind of permanent watch list though the postal service? I have not ordered in like 5 months and I&#039;m starting to get the itch.

				I find it hard to believe the post office has the resources to scan every piece of mail delivered to an individual who is not already on some serious surveillance. I mean every bill, every piece of junk mail would have to be x-rayed. <br /><br />If I was you and itching, I&#039;d open a PO box and order. I mean if your friend wanted to really bust you, wouldn&#039;t he just order drugs and send them to your house in your name?<br /><br />What exactly did your friend snitch you out on? I mean did you get visited by any LEOs? Did he just give everyone&#039;s name he could? I think it shows really good discipline on your part to have waited for 5 months. <br /><br />But be realistic, even with the NSA&#039;s PRSIM, it still takes individual local departments man hours to surveil an individual. There is no way they could get budget authorization to just watch someone indefinitely. <br /><br />Depending on the state you live in, you could order something decriminalized, like cannabis, as a test. Or even some of the legal products on the SR. <br /><br />Anything you do is a risk, but imo, nothing is riskier than coping out in public. So if you are instead driving to someone&#039;s house to buy drugs and then drive home, the reality is that is probably FAR riskier behavior than safely ordering to one&#039;s house.

				It was a really weird situation. I don&#039;t consider him a friend anymore I was just talking in past tense I suppose. <br /><br />I was never visited by LEO&#039;s or anything. This person lives at home and his father has a very high security clearance with the government and if he was convicted his father was to lose his job even though said friend is 21. I almost don&#039;t blame him for ratting me out. Again I do not even know if he really even ratted me out for sure but I&#039;m sure sometime during his many court hearings they asked him where he got the drugs. Like I said the kid is a loose screw now, since he got let off he has had many traffic tickets, an assault charge, and more alcohol/weed/paraphernalia charges. I would like to believe that anything this kid has said to the police has been discredited. Getting off topic a little bit but he was a really good friend that I knew since growing up. I feel like some things he has said to me before was an attempt to reach out for help but I just ignored him and played it off as &quot;he&#039;s just being himself&quot;.<br /><br />I think I have made the choice to order again. I will order under my name. I will only order personal amounts. I will NOT&nbsp; talk about SR, If anyone ever brings it up.<br /><br />I have trust in SR and my own abilities to anonymize myself. <br /><br />

				Depends on where you are really. From what you have said I wouldn&#039;t be too worried as long as you are only receiving personal amounts.
