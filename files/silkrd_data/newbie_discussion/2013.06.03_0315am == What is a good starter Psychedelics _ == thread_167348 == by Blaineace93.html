				Okay I have been researching what&nbsp; Psychedelics are and what effects they can have on the body/mind, I have also been doing meditative exercises to help with my minds restraint... So with this in mind i was wandering if anyone can help recommend on what&nbsp; Psychedelics i should tryout for my first trip and whether or not i should it solo or in a group setting ?.... Also what type of environment should i try to put myself into when i take the&nbsp; psychedelics aka my room or out in the open field/natural environment (away from the general public obviously).... Any advice would be appreciated for this first time tripper

				I think shrooms would be good for your first time, but you have to remember everyone is different and everyone has different reactions to different drugs. I find it comforting to have someone going through, somewhat, the same experience you are. So I would suggest for your first time have two close friends you are very comfortable with. One to trip with and one to trip sit. <br /><br />I love the outdoors and really think that&#039;s where psychedelic experiences should happen. Indoors is just a different feeling and pretty much a whole different experience in itself. <br /><br />You must realize how confusing things can get on psychedelics. If you are tripping hard enough simply conversation can get too confusing. Be prepared for this.<br /><br />Remember to embrace everything that happens in the trip. Just let everything happen and don&#039;t fight it.<br /><br />Make a nice playlist of relaxing music that just has good vibes to it. If you are looking for music that will help you get lost inside your own mind I would recommend some Pink Floyd. <br /><br />For your first time tripping try your hardest to avoid anyone you don&#039;t know. Stay away from any authority, parents, anyone that you don&#039;t want to be around lol. <br /><br />If you find yourself in a bad place or having a bad thought, simply change the setting. It might be as simple as changing the song that is on, or maybe all you need to do is walk away by yourself and look at some flowers. <br /><br />I wrote this up pretty fast and skipped a good bit, but if you have any specific questions please ask! <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				I second everything Psychedelic Sphere mentioned.&nbsp; My first trip was on shrooms.&nbsp; I wanted to do it alone, as sort of a vision quest type thing, but all my friends insisted it was a bad idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned since, when I&#039;m tripping with people and I get separated from the group, its not a good thing.&nbsp; Its hard to explain, but your mind gets caught in a circular thinking.

				I had my first trip yesterday, and I ate a whole 1/8th (3.5 grams) of shrooms (cubensis). Wonderful introduction to psychedelics. Whether you do it alone or in a group or with a friend is up to you really. I strongly felt that I should do it alone and so I did. I was almost certain that having sober people around me would freak me out, but if you and say one close friend do it together you should do fine. Just make sure this friend is cool as fuck. I recommend a first dosage of 2g-2.5g of cubes. Doing it in your home would be safest, but if you can find a secluded park or nature setting that you&#039;re familiar with do it there. I regret not going outside...i feel like the visuals would&#039;ve been amazing. Music is VERY important imo. Make sure you have a playlist of light, positive music that you enjoy. Heavy/sad/angry music will freak you out. AVOID ALL NEGATIVITY before and during the trip. If you start bugging out just &quot;embrace the madness:. Most of this also applies to LSD as well, but I have yet to try it. Good luck!

				Good input by previous replies.&nbsp; :D Remember that psychedelics affect everyone differently. On that note, I think I&#039;m sensitive to shrooms as there is always a thirty or so minute negative period before things lighten up. I get a a lot pain throughout my body and have to soldier on. Figured I&#039;d share this in the off chance you try them and feel this. In which case, remember, it will pass!<br /><br />Everyone I talk to considering using such substances I tell to keep one foot on the ground. Remember that you&#039;ve taken something and that reality is supposed to skew, and indeed it will wear off. On that note, also let go. As mentioned, your thoughts may loop, and to someone new this might be maddening. I dropped acid for the first time in years yesterday and found myself looping in random thoughts. Kept that foot grounded though, kept aware of the situation, then let go and watched the ceiling continue to morph and shift into sandwiches. Much of that trip actually ended up with sandwiches.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Babsitters are smart, but at the same time, it can be a bit offputting to have someone around not tripping as well. Trip with someone experienced or start off easy doing a low dose.&nbsp; :P Have fun and be safe.

				I think mushrooms are a good starter psychedelic compared to LSD because the duration is shorter. My first psychedelic experience was on a 3.2g shroom of my homegrown mushrooms and it was magical. It was me and my two friends in the woods in the afternoon. I had tried other drugs at this point, and was smoking weed daily for 2 years, so i felt like i could handle 3.2g. I had researched the hell out of it, and while i was peaking i remember saying &quot;this is exactly what they said it would be like.&quot; I felt like socrates, like i knew everything and was at peace with myself.<br /><br />I have recently tried LSD for the first time, 2 tabs of JOR&#039;s Hoffmans. It was crazy, but was not as good as my shroom trips. I know that this was because of the setting, it was not right and at times i was uncomfortable. And it lasted longer than i wanted to.

				While i agree that Psilocybes make for a great starter psychedelic trip, it can make your stomach upset, i know quite a few people who threw up within one hour after dosing, and i know that it&#039;s something that can ruin a trip. Also thought loops aren&#039;t always fun. You will react differently from other people, maybe you need 1.75g to get where you want to be, maybe you&#039;ll need 7g, you should start small one time and take a bigger step, if you want to, the next time. <br /><br />Having experimented a little with mushrooms, i can say they&#039;re fun, but they don&#039;t really work for me. I took 3.5g almost everytime i did some, with some friends on the same batch and dosage as me, and while they were tripping balls and hallucinating, i just felt mild euphoria and had the giggles.<br /><br />But with time, i learned that every psychedelic does this for me, so i&#039;ve gotten used to it and double my doses.<br /><br />What i would recommend is 2C-B. Because it&#039;s easy to dose accurately (if you have the right tools), it doesn&#039;t last long, you can steer your trip in the direction that you want, i can&#039;t imagine a bad trip on this because it makes you feel amazing, i don&#039;t get any nausea or other uncomfortable body effects from it like i get from Psilocybes or NBOMEs, and don&#039;t forget that sex is awesome on 2C-B..<br />Only thing is; i&#039;m not sure i could get a &#039;&#039;spiritual trip&#039;&#039; from it like i can get from shrooms or LSD.<br /><br />Stay safe and have fun.

				I would probably recommend mushrooms in a proper set and setting, either with a trip sitter or with someone or someones your close and comfortable with. For my first time I ate about 2 grams dried, and it wasn&#039;t too intense or overpowering at all, completely comfortable and enjoyable. Eventually move up to 3 or more grams for that big trip, and then you&#039;ll be more than ready for LSD. I avoid RCs at all costs.

				a small amount of lsd, a small amount of mescaline, a small amount of extracted mescaline, a small amount of 2c-i if you&#039;re okay with RCs.<br /><br />stay the hell away from mushrooms.

				Ironically, my first psychedelic experience was with Salvia. That is an example of a bad choice of your first psychedelic.

				Either LSD or Shrooms. They usually offer the best visuals and are not so hard (shrooms can be in some circumstances more than LSD, but if you just embrace the fear and let go you can easily turn that fear in bliss). Also 2C-B are good for first times (but I still prefer good old LSD myself).<br /><br />After you have tried both I suggest you to then go to DMT. It can be a bit intense at beginning but then it&#039;s one of the most wonderful psychedelics. Just is best if you don&#039;t do it as your first dive into these wonderful substances. While it is true that nothing can prepare you for DMT, having a little of experience in the psychedelic states before using it undoubtedly helps.<br /><br />In any case, whatever you decide to try at beginning, stay away from Salvia at first.

				25i is very affordable and in a low dose is not as strong as shrooms or LSD. I think is a nice substance to start experimenting.

				I would also recommend mushrooms. I would recommend that you take them infused in tea to reduce the chances of upsetting your stomach. Just break apart the mushrooms into small pieces with your fingers, put then in a teopot, pour hot water, cover the pot, and let it brew for at least thirty minutes (you don&#039;t need to keep heating up the water).<br /><br />Also, my recommendation is to take mushrooms in a quiet place, either by yourself or with a close friend who is also taking mushrooms, or with a sitter. However, the sitter should be somebody who should not be intrusive, only to support you if necessary. I would avoid taking mushrooms in a place with a lot of distractions or people, or with people who are taking other types of drugs.<br /><br />Bon voyage!

				Prob shrooms just be aware once they are in your system their is no turning back. The trick is to start small don&#039;t go swallowing crazy amounts that are going to freak you or whoever out then work your way up. Get some experience under your belt before you venture out to far.

				Definitely mushrooms. They are natural. The does is pretty self-explanatory. It doesn&#039;t take much to get off with them, just a gram or a gram and half and you should be set for a good experience. Acid is a little too intense for the first time.

				i would recommend mushrooms kind doesnt matter so much, cubensis in my experience more enjoyable but everyone is different.&nbsp; Start with half eigth 1.75 gram not more than that.&nbsp; Do it by yourself or with other people that take them too, the same amount.&nbsp; Or ideally with someone else that has taken them before.&nbsp; Your envirnment will dictate how your trip goes and mushrooms will really amplify your feelings, if you are happy you will laugh your ass off, if you get in bad mood you will bug out.&nbsp; If you bug out just remember that it will end soon you wont feel like that forever.&nbsp; When you eat them , roll them up in a fruit-roll-up the kids snack, you wont even taste the mushrooms.&nbsp; Enjoy, mushrooms are my favorite :)

				If you are worried about nausea and throwing up simply brew a shroom tea. It makes the shrooms hit you faster and I never get nauseous after drinking! And it&#039;s way easier to get them down compared to chewing them up. I can tell you how to do it if you like. It&#039;s pretty easy.
