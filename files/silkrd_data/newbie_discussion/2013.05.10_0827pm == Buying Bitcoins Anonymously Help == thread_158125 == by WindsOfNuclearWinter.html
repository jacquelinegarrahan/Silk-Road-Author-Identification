				Hi guys, <br />So I&#039;m looking for ways to get some bitcoins but contrary to what I was previously told bitcoins aren&#039;t fully anonymous and can actually quite easily be traced back to you by LE should they feel especially tenacious - maybe a fresh box of donuts and coffee. <br /><br />So I&#039;ve done some prowling and would really like to use an exchange site to acquire coins as it seems the easiest, but have yet to find any decent ones. By decent I mean ones that don&#039;t require ridiculous amounts of information like copies of your I.D, your address, etc. <br /><br />Can anyone help a noob out? I&#039;m struggling to find what the majority of people here must be using because it doesn&#039;t make sense to me that people buying and selling on SR frequently would be happy with leaving crumb trails behind them... <br />Assuming that once you transfer your bitcoins to SR via, say, MtGox - who needs personal information and stores it - somewhere there will be evidence of that money going to SR. <br />Which would make it rather hard to deny in court why a package with drugs has shown up with my name on it...<br /><br />I know it&#039;s unlikely but contingency and all that. <br /><br /><br />Any help is super appreciated :)

				If you are used to IRC, i could recommend bitcoin-otc. It&#039;s a channel on freenode where you can exchange bitcoins with other people... might be harder to get back to you easily :)<br /><br />You can check out this link: http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Beginners_Guide<br /><br />If you are from north america, Bitinstant seems like a popular way to get bicoins anonymously...<br /><br />Cheers, and welcome on board!

				Method #1:<br /><br />If you are from the US, you can use bitinstant.com --&gt; silk road btc address.<br /><br />If you extra paranoid, you can use bitinstant --&gt; bitcoin fog (tumbler) btc address --&gt; silk road btc address.<br /><br />BitInstant doesn&#039;t require ID, so you should remain highly anonymous this way.<br /><br />Method #2:<br /><br />You can also purchase a MoneyPak from CVS/Walgreens/Walmart and exchange for BTC with Sugar Mama. Here is a link to her profile:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/aace915f06<br /><br />Method #3:<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about this deep-web site, but I hear BlueSkyTraders are legitimate exchangers. Check them out!<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

I would suggest you set up a free wallet at blockchain.info. Then you will see an option to add funds to the wallet, and select &quot;cash&quot;. It will then take you to the ZipZap site, where you need to put in your (real) zipcode. It will give you a list of several places near you where you can go pay. Just give them a fake name, email and phone number. Now print out the receipt and drive to the MoneyGram location near you. Ask for a blue form and fill it out with the info on the receipt you printed. They wont ask for ID.<br /><br />Then once you get your coins in your blockchain wallet, you can tranfer them right to SR.

				Things to remember about moneygram are also these:<br /><br />They need an address, have a fake one ready to use<br /><br />Make sure you put down the name us used on bitinstant on the form as well<br /><br />these were both things that threw me off when I first used bitinstant.

				Sell something, and take BTC as payment.<br />Buy off of eBay with a burnable credit card.<br />You can use bitinstant, they take money grams. You&#039;re suppose to but your real name, but most employees never ask to see your I.D.<br />I&#039;ve seen Bitcoin laundry sites.

				From reading on this forum and another, bitcoinfog is your friend.<br /><br />Bitinstant via TOR (use CASH...I don&#039;t know how people are comfortable with credit/banks)--&gt;Easywallet (TOR)--&gt;Bitcoinfog (tumbled)--&gt;SR (tumble).<br /><br />Give that money a nice washing up.
