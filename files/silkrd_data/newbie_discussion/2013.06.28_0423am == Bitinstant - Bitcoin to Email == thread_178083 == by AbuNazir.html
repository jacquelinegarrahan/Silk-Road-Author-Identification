				Has anyone used this option recently? I have read some negative stuff about BitInstant lately but I decided to try a small amount to see if they have things straightened out. Everything went fine and there was an email in my inbox by the time I got home saying my transaction had been executed and sent to the email I ha=d set to receive. And of course, I go to that email and there is nothing there. I know when you send to a wallet it can take a few hours for confirmations and the coin to show up, but their name is Bitinstant, not bit two hours from now lol. Anyone had any luck with this type of transfer? I sent it to a tormail address and I hope that is not the problem, it shouldn&#039;t be. Any advice is appreciated.

				With the weirdness of bitinstant lately, you should just email their support. They&#039;re pretty prompt about responding, even with all the shit that&#039;s going on.

				Yeah I emailed their support and got an automated reply saying they would look into it. It&#039;s fine if I have to wait, but it makes me nervous that they sent me an email saying it&#039;s done plus show the order as executed on my account yet I didn&#039;t get anything. I should have just sent it to my wallet instead of doing the email option.
