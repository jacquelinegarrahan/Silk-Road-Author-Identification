				Welcome newbies, and not so newbies that don&#039;t post often. You have arrived at my Newbie Review Thread.<br /><br />I sell cannabis to new and veteran SR buyers alike. I never require FE. I ship Monday - Thursday. USA domestic shipping only.<br />I sell Skush (Skunk x OG Kush). I grow it myself, indoors. It is 100% organic.<br />I don&#039;t require PGP to order, but I recommend it. If you are just getting started with PGP feel free to send me a message to practice. I will happily work with you until we are successful.<br /><br />My vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4d6b278a41<br />My other review thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35630.0<br /><br />These pictures were all taken by customers who ordered from me here on the Silk Road:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vt5.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vts.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vtq.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vtk.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vtf.jpg<br /><br /><br />Please feel free to chime in with any questions, concerns, comments, random drivel that bumps this thread, etc.<br /><br />I hope I can earn your business.

				My most recent feedback:<br /><br />&quot;rec&#039;d 1/24 good stuff thanks<br /><br />This bud is DANK! Truly a pleasure to smoke. It shipped super quick too. I will definitely buy again.<br /><br />Excellent product, as always. Fast delivery<br /><br />super speedy delivery, 48hrs from order to door! Very discreet packaging and couldn&#039;t be more satisified!<br /><br />Fast shipping and it came in overweight. Legit seller!<br /><br />A+++ Fast, secure, overweight, buy with confidence. Great vendor for first time SR users!!!<br /><br />You&#039;re the best f1. :)<br /><br />First time from this vendor but not the last<br /><br />just received, fast delivery, great packaging and cant wait to dive in!!!<br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;m erasing the previous review because my buddy misweighed the bud at 25g. He was a dumbass, the weight is good, I just weighed it at 26 grams, and he&#039;s already smoked a lot of it, so I assume the original weight was 28g+<br />Phenomenal buds, comparable in quality to Christy&#039;s BD if not better. I love the site :)<br /><br />ordered arrived in 8 days from time of order placement. 2.8 grams over so worth the time.<br />Better than money from home.<br /><br />PERFECT once again! Fast shipping, great product, very happy camper :)<br /><br />Great product and service; thanks<br />for all!<br /><br />Got to me super fast, like 2 days, fast. Completely surprised. Awesome Seller<br /><br />awesome<br /><br />Extremely satisfied with overall transaction. Will be back for more.<br /><br />fast delivery, potent &amp; stinky stuff&quot;<br /><br />

				Assuming in fact, those photos are indeed real, and im sure they are... That green looks like some fire! After reading this and reading your profile I really like the way you present yourself. If I wasnt so fucking poor (im talkn almost gettn mids (locally) -- that poor). This looks like dank weed and a fantastic person to be getting it from.<br /><br />THUMBS UP.

				Thanks for the kind words redcube!<br /><br />Do you folks like the bud porn? Does it help you make a decision when shopping on the SR?

				Farmer is obviously a very skilled grower, and yes what you see in the pictures is the same bud you get.&nbsp; But even those pictures don&#039;t really do it justice, you have to have them in your hands to understand the level of dankness these buds are at. Farmer was the first vendor I grabbed actual buds off from the road (first weed related purchase was tweetb&#039;s bubble hash, and that shit is magnificent), and honestly it&#039;s gonna be real hard to convince myself to ever try anyone else. Usually I don&#039;t like to receive the same strain more than twice, but farmer&#039;s skush just has me hooked. <br /><br />I can&#039;t even explain how much I love this bud. Perfectly dried, meticulous trim job (dude must break his back trimming these buds, for real), amazing cure, a very sour dank scent, perfect burn no matter what you smoke it in, smooth hits (not harsh at all), and if I had to describe the taste it would be an atomic lemon flavor that jumps out at you and dies down to a nice floral taste on the exhale. Even burns into a pure grey ash, so you know there&#039;s no nutrients or anything else in it. Basically it&#039;s perfect from the grinder to the exhale. I&#039;ll be buying farmer&#039;s buds again and again, and I hope he sticks around for a long time.
