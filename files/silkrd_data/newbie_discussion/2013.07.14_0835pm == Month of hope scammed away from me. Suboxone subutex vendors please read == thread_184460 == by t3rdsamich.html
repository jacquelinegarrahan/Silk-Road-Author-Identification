				NO NEED TO SEND ANYMORE BTC. I HAVE WHAT I NEED. THANK YOU DUTCH81. IM ONLY LEAVING THIS POST UP SO THAT YOUR GOOD DEED MAY BE READ BY OTHERS. <br /><br /><br />I am soooo close to having this suboxone order. A half a bitcoin and I can place my order and if all goes well it will be here the day that I run out of my oxyneo and I will be able to detox from the painkillers for good..... Thank you to those who have helped so far. You will be paid back. <br /><br />Hi everyone. I have been on this site for a few months now and the reason I sought it out was to find some suboxone or subutex so that I could detox at home. <br /><br />I have degenerative disc disease and recently had a spinal fusion. I have been prescribed 3 80mg oxyneo and 3 10mg supeudol instant release oxycodone ever 4 hours per day. It works out to close to 600mg a day. <br /><br />Now recently I ordered some suboxone from a vendor that was having a blowout sale. He had 100% positive feedback from 300+ transactions.&nbsp; Now he was asking people to FE and I really didnt want to do so, so I told him that I couldnt afford the order right now as I was on disability and money was tight. He said oh your disabled? We will help you out , we believe that if we help the disabled it will come back to us in some odd way and he waived the $40 shipping cost. So not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth I accepted his terms and finalized early. As soon as I had done so I felt like I had done something wrong and searched his name in the forum. Sure enough people were talking about him just scamming everyone to bankroll himself for his next username. <br /><br />I contacted him the next day and he told me that DPR had turned narc and was turning in all the vendors. I said listen, just be honest with me, you know my situation and I only have enough meds to last me ten days. Is my order on the way? Cuz I need to figure something else out if its not. No reply since...<br /><br /><br />If there are any vendors out there with suboxone or subutex, I have 1.40- 1.60 btc right now. What Im asking is, if I purchase 1.60 worth is there anyone who would send me 10 8mg suboxone or subutex so that I can do my detox? I have 2 here already that I got in a test order I made weeks before.&nbsp; <br /><br />I give my word as a man and a Canadian that I will send the outstanding bitcoins to any vendor that can help me. You will have my real address and name and could always post in the forums never to sell to me if I dont hold up my end of the deal. I get paid my $590 disability check on the 26th of the month then it takes 3 business days for the money to hit cavirtex. I promise you as soon as I have the bitcoins purchased I will send them directly to your account. <br /><br />Im also asking for anyone who can afford it to donate to my cause. If you give me your wallet address I will send the money back to you the same day I would give it to a vendor. I only need maybe another half a bitcoin to 1 full bitcoin to get this order in. If it is shipped out on Monday I just might make without having to go to emergency.<br /><br />Here is my wallet address, a moderator has been nice enough to lend me .37 already. I will not accept more than I need. <br /><br /><br />147KyiiqAWw1AAFXoXidSotTCZ7gCJsyz1<br /><br />Thank you in advance to anyone for any kind of help you can give me. You have no idea how much it will mean to me. This was supposed to be my month of hope and it was ruined by a scamming vendor.

				Thank you so much, you have no idea how much I appreciate this. You have my word as a Canadian and as a man that I will send you back the btc. I get my check on the 26th and then it takes 3 business days for my deposit to hit cavirtex. Thats where I buy my bitcoins from. Then its just a couple hours for them to send the coin to me. Sometimes its instant but you have my word I will send it back to you. I will add your address to my wallet with the name hero beside it and the amount I need to send you. Thank you for understanding. Your a good person. I will not take advantage of that or disappoint you. :D :D :D :D :D<br /><br />That makes .87 plus my 1.04 Im almost there Im going to go get an exact price needed to purchase and I will update the post. Thanks again everyone.

				OMFG WOW!!!!!! THANK YOU SO SO SO SO SO MUCH!!!!!! I CANT BELIEVE IT!!!!! YOU HAVE MADE ME AN EXTREMELY HAPPY MAN!!!!<br />WOW.... you have no idea how much this means to me. Just when it feels like your whole life has fallen apart and you have lost all faith in humanity someone like you comes along and changes everything. I will not let you down I swear on my fathers grave I will send you 1 btc on payday. I will give you more if I can afford it, it may not be much extra but I will do my best. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are a good good human being and I hope nothing but good things come your way. Hopefully someone will be there for you if you are ever in a time of need.
