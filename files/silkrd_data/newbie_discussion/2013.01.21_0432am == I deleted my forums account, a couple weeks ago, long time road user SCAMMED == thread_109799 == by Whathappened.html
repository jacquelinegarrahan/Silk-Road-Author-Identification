				Its funny. I suggested the idea of a newbie section a few weeks ago. I guess DPR read my post in the discussion section. Well Ill try and make my story short. I have been a member of the road and forums for a good 6 months. I had a decent post count, almost 200. I had spent on the road about 15000$ with several accounts. I finally had the grand opening of my vendor account which was going great. I got a few 5 out of 5 feedback which spoke of how amazing the product was and how amazing my packaging was within my first few days. Then everything turned bad. What I didn&#039;t know is that a family member wanted revenge on me after many years of peace and called the police telling them how I was doing A, B, and C.(I can not say the actual details of what I was reported for because of my own safety.) The police tapped my phone line, got some evidence and came and made an arrest. I was tipped off that the police were coming for me right before. I tried getting into my accounts to transfer out the large amount of bitcoins I had, but for some reason none of my accounts would log in. I also wanted to change all of the passwords. You see my phone was acting funny so I had assumed it had been bugged or something. On my IPHONE was all of my accounts, there usernames and passwords. I wanted to lock any ability of the police getting into my SR accounts.I messaged the SR staff and DPR, begging them to shut down my accounts. In my message I included all of my passwords so they knew I was no scammer and I was me.&nbsp; Well what happened is I was arrested and found out they had indeed cloned my phone and had all of my SR information. I got bailed out and came home to a ransacked house. The police confiscated multiple pounds of marijuana and all of my packing equipment. I tried logging into my accounts, but they still were not letting me in. I hoped they had been deleted by dpr as I asked and he moved the coins out to the BTC address I provided him. I searched my forums accounts names and there they were. Not deleted. I managed to get in and delete them, but I never was able to get into my SR account and delete them or change the passwords. I looked up my vendor account and it was still there. I am at a loss here. I was a respectable member of the community so I dont understand why DPR wouldnt help me. Now I have no money for a lawyer as everything was tied up in my Road account and in the MJ I had in my house. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I beg of someone to suggest some advice. I need that vendor account closed and my BTC, so I can get a chance at a good lawyer so I dont spend the rest of my life being pounded by my cell mate bubba&#039;s 14 inch dick.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just so everyone knows. I messaged Captain Mal for help, DPR for help, SR vendor support for help, and SR support for help. No one did anything or helped me. I still havent received a message to my tormail account so I can assume they have taken the money. I personally dont understand why. It just makes no damn sense. You can all keep the fucking money just please delete the accounts I need deleted. If anyone can help I will PM you the accounts names.

				No one stole your money.&nbsp; You say you asked DPR / SR to delete your accounts, but that you couldn&#039;t log in?&nbsp; Why would SR support delete anyone&#039;s account when the request is coming from someone who isn&#039;t able to log in?<br /><br />Why aren&#039;t you able to log in?&nbsp; If you are the vendor you say you are, shouldn&#039;t you have the necessary login info?&nbsp; Otherwise, I can&#039;t see how SR support / DPR would be able to know that you aren&#039;t just trying to scam someone.<br /><br />No one has the ability to access accounts - that I know of - except for admins / DPR.&nbsp; No mod could do much of anything to help in this situation.

				The road keeps rejecting my log in information. When I messaged DPR I included my seller accounts password and pin so that he knew I was who I said I was. I am going to try messaging DPR again with my password and username.

				NEVER keep your passwords written anywhere.&nbsp; This is the easiest way to have your accounts compromised.&nbsp; ...even my 54-character PGP encryption password is memorized.
