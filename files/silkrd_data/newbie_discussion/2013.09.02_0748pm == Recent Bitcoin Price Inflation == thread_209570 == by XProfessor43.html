				Hey, I made my first purchase around 2 weeks ago and 1 BTC = £72, and since I last checked (around 3hours) they were selling for £92 / BTC.<br /><br />As I am from the UK, I use bitbargain, very trusted site and sellers.<br /><br />Glad I had 0.8 BTC leftover from 2 weeks ago now :p

				please use localbitcoins....if you dont want to get scammed or screwed just use them.....they use an escrow system like SR so if a seller doesnt give you the coins but you can prove payment like with a receipt the support team will release them , also you have way more protection that way, alot of the LBC vendors let you do a cash deposit at a bank im telling you its painless and the best way....many times coins are in your possession in less than 5 minutes after your provided proof of payment

				the inflation is a weird point for me. Like if I buy a certain amount of bitcoins worth a number of dollars... send over to SR but they are no longer worth as much... i&#039;ve lost money before I&#039;ve had a chance to make a purchase. I wish there was a more stable currency available.

If you have $200 USD it does not mean that you will get $200 worth of bitcoin. Your $200 will pay a transaction fee to the broker and you will get the rest in Bicoins. Check to see your transaction fee isn&#039;t excessive (anything above 10% should be criminal). <br /><br />The best thing you can do is simply buy about $200 worth of coin. Transfer it to your SR account right away and buy $200 worth of product right away (factor in shipping for accuracy). Anything other than this is known as investment speculation. If you hang on to the BtC long enough something in the value relative to the $USD will change and you will either win or lose.

				Seems to be going up now so waiting a bit after your purchase doesnt have to be bad. A<br />Although it can drop FAST aswell

				Get your coins, get in, and get out! If you have some left over and they increase in value count yourself lucky.&nbsp; I had about $35 left over after my last purchase, and it started going up.&nbsp; I waited to long to make a purchase on a couple stamps though, and now it&#039;s down a dollar or so and I don&#039;t have enough.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to predict this stuff.

				It can be very profitable if you get in and out at the right time. I made thousands off the spike referred to earlier.&nbsp; Currently there&#039;s not quite the hype as there was then though.<br /><br />I feel comfortable enough with where it&#039;s at right now that I&#039;m going to purchase some coins but I know I take a risk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck everyone.&nbsp; It&#039;s all part of the game :)
