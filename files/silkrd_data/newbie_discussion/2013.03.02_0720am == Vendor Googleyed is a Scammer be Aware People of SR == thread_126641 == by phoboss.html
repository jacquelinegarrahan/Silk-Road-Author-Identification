				I bought something worth $300 from Vendor Googleyed only to be sent something that costs $10 twice and when I confronted him he said no I must be mistaken what a scamming piece of shit plus I&#039;ve filtered through the feedback on his vendor page and every 2 feedbacks is a complaint now the only reason i ordered from him is cos apparently what I wanted was shipped from my country anyway by Googleyed so I thought I&#039;d put an order in and I&#039;ll have it a day or two later how wrong I was not only did he lie about when my order was put in transit but like I said he&#039;s scammed me out of $290 oh by the way he never placed my order in transit untill way over 15 days look all I&#039;m saying is steer clear from this scamming indian from pakistan ok or get F, like I did and the thing that pisses me off is he sent me 2 orders 1 from USA and 1 from UK now how much of a security risk is that ha and to get it and find out it&#039;s something you&#039;ve never even seen in your lifetime imagine it people so like I said beware order at your own risk but if I was you I would not order oh and to all the idiots who are gonna try back him up yeah you&#039;ve ordered from him but how many were broken and how many were missing each time ha every other one of his feedback is just pure complaints like this anyway buy at your own risk don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t try to warn you when you get scammed ok people peace out love phoboss.

				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Just to add a bit of transparency here. This guy &quot;Phoboss&quot; made an order for our #4 H, which incidentally has been very popular since we introduced it recently. Please take a look at the feedback here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3b4405eae7<br /><br />Before it even arrived, we received 3 or 4 long rambling messages complaining that it was not there within 24 hours. Even after we informed him that it had been shipped already, Royal Mail, untracked, he still kept hassling us for updates. Clearly that was not possible, because it was untracked, but that doesn&#039;t seem to hinder this guy. Incidentally, it arrived within 3 business days, and took about 36 hours processing. We have a lot of orders to get through, and despite what people seem to think a 1st class stamp does not get an envelope to you overnight.<br /><br />Anyway, when it finally did arrive, he sent a very abusive message complaining that this white powder was definitely not heroin. Clearly he was expecting #3 heroin, diamorphine freebase, which is the most common in the UK, and is brown in appearance. Our product is #4 heroin, dimorphine HCL, and is white in appearance. I would advise Phoboss to take a look at google.com some time and check this information before flying off on one and saying he has been ripped. He obviously didn&#039;t, and now looks rather silly.<br /><br />So, he wrote us a lot of long, unpunctuated, hate mail, with inappropriate use of CAPS LOCK in most of his particularly impolite sentences, including death threats, and threatening to &quot;shut us down&quot;. As you all well know, Googleyed does not respond well to this shit, especially the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation, and the dreaded CAPS LOCK!<br /><br />Some particularly irritating statements:<br /><br />&quot;DO NOT MAKE ME WAIT FOR RESOLUTION BULL SHIT OK SORT THIS NOW BEFORE I HIT THE FORUMS TRUST ME THIS IS NOT A FRETT IT&#039;S A PROMISE YOU IDOOT&quot;<br /><br />Well, it certainly is not a &quot;frett&quot;, whatever that might be! This line led GE to believe that the customer Phoboss might still be in his teens. Thus the immature nature with which he has dealt with this matter. And this was before we even replied to him! Guy really does not know how to deal with people correctly.<br /><br />&quot;ARE YOU A CUNT REIMBURSE ME YOU BASTARD OR NAME A PLACE AND I&#039;LL GLADLY COME SEE YOU OK CUNT&quot;<br /><br />Using &quot;cunt&quot; twice in the same sentence. Wonderfully wide vocabulary you possess there kid. And you want to come see GE? Now, we have been reprimanded before for this kind of thing, so we are not gonna get sucked into going down this road, however very very tempting it is.<br /><br />Now at this point, we have told Phoboss that he needs to calm down, and stop the abuse, or we are not gonna discuss this matter at all. But no, we get another few long rambling abusive messages, threatening us, demanding a full refund or he is gonna get his friends and fuck us up, topped off with:<br /><br />&quot;Your finished satan spawn liar dangerous devil WATCH THIS YOU THIEF SCAMMING BASTARD&quot;<br /><br />And then he comes to the forums and starts gunning us here too..<br /><br />Essentially, all you need to do is ask yourself this question; Would you take the time out of your busy day to deal with this complete asshole? I think I can answer that for everyone actually. NO. So, Googleyed has told Phoboss &quot;We have absolutely no interest in talking to you.&quot; And that is where this ends. The SR team can take it from here.<br /><br />And just to address a couple of statements he made in his OP:<br /><br />If it was processing for 15 days... Why did he not cancel the order?? You can cancel after 4 days. So that is clearly bullshit!<br /><br />Every other feedback is a complaint? Well, we have been going for nearly 2 years, and have one of the best reputations on the road. Our stats speak for themselves. And I invite, and even encourage, everyone to take a look at our feedback, epic stats, and try out our service with its excelling customer care.<br /><br />India from Pakistan? Firstly, racial agro? Not here bro. Take it elsewhere! And incidentally, when has anyone ever met an Indian.. From Pakistan.. ??? That would be a Pakistani, you ill-educated piece of human excrement! Shut your mouth, you adolescent junkie reprobate!<br /><br />Also, I invite everyone to look at Phoboss&#039;s stats (phoboss - Jr. Member - Posts: 81 - Karma: +10/-36 &lt; Shitty rating due to being discouraged by the SR community) and posts here on the forums (Constantly accusing vendors of ripping him), and decide for yourself whether he is either really unlucky and gets scammed every five minutes, or whether he is just the kind of asshole that screams &quot;scammer, scammer!&quot; every five minutes hoping to get a free handout when he is getting WDs. Well, not from GE!! (googleyed1 - SR Vendor - Hero Member - Posts: 931 - Karma: +34/-14 &lt; Epic rating due to the fact that GE is a legend, and is loved by the SR community)<br /><br />Ok guys. Rant over. I think I have taken this douche to pieces quite enough for today..<br /><br />Kind regards to all, Googleyed<br /><br />And remember kids... Don&#039;t do drugs!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				This kid is such a chucklehead. I am not one to take sides generally, when it comes to the ever-present feud between clients and vendors over whether one or the other may or may not have been scammed...but even IF this kid DID get hoodwinked...he sure as shit doesn&#039;t deserve a refund of even a single dollar...even after the dollar was used by GE to cleanse the shit from the crevices of his ass crack after a night of PBR&#039;s and Taco Bell infused with copious amounts of laxatives. Thank you GE for the effort at transparency. This practice should be a rule of thumb for ALL SR MEMBERS...client and vendor alike.<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor
