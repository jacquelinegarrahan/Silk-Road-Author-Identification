				I was recently ripped off pretty nicely by OzGrow for $200/14 grams of pot. Since then this vendor has been dragging my name through the mud in the vendor forums and in private messages, according to his final PM to me.<br /><br />I just placed an order with a new pot vendor. I have taken a screen shot of the page just before I ordered it, with my address in clear view so I have proof that I did send it to my own address in the case that I get done over again.<br /><br />Would it be safe to share this information with a moderator or admin ahead of shipping to avoid more accusations if the unthinkable happens again? Or if a vendor decides I&#039;m the perfect target to rip off because who will believe someone twice in a row? And if so, who would be willing/should I share this with? <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />P

				The best I understand it is, the mods here are completely separate form SR admins, they have no say to what happens over there.<br /><br />And the Admins over there... <br /><br />-For one, I highly doubt they&#039;ll want SS&#039;s of your orders before you even have problems with said orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Two... a SS is not proof that you&#039;re not a scammer (not saying you are, but you have to look at it from the other side).&nbsp; A scammer buyer could take a SS and still claim he didn&#039;t get his order... wanting money back or reship, whatever.<br /><br />Losing money and/or getting ripped off happens to the best of us, learn from it and move on.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re that worried about your name etc., start a new account.

				I understand it isn&#039;t fool proof. But if I posted it after said potential rip off, I could be accused of photoshopping it to fit the new evidence. At least if the screen shot said &quot;suburb A&quot; and the tracking said &quot;suburb B&quot; I would have insurance against this (the last order was shipped to a different suburb than my own, and OzGrow took the fact that I had no proof I didn&#039;t live there as enough reason to take the cash and block me).<br /><br />As far as changing accounts, I could easily have done this. But <br /><br />a) I haven&#039;t done anything wrong and don&#039;t believe in running away. I intend to continue to build good relationships with vendors under this name.<br />b) If I did switch accounts and it came out somehow, I look 100% guilty and I get no more business.<br /><br />Pushing ahead with this account and being as transparent as possible is the best option imo.
