				as you can see i&#039;m very new to all this so i&#039;ll just ask &amp; see what happens....<br />i&#039;ve read around &amp; quite a few people get their bitcoins transferred straight to their SR account.(bypassing 3rd party wallet)<br />these people are making smallish purchases straight away &amp; always domestic purchases only.<br />i kind&#039;ve understand why a wallet is a good idea but is it &quot;essential&quot;?<br />are there circumstances where it would be considered &quot;less than ideal&quot; but not a HUGE risk to just get a bitcoin vendor to tranfer to my SR account?<br /><br />thx for your time....

				Ive bitinstanted to SR directly, didnt spontaneously combust BUT<br />always th chance SR gets hit again, and the trail from drugs-sr-you at a moneygram on video is shorter/less convoluted than using blockhain or similiar

				i would not put my coins directly into SR. it doesn&#039;t take much more time to go through a wallet.<br />a lot of people use blockchain. its free.<br />i know there are other services that cost a fee that might be worth consideration as well.<br />i&#039;m not a computer/security person in the least but everyone around here has a ton of information. i think taking advantage of it as much as you can is the best idea for a long and safe run.<br /><br /><br />

				Calculated risks, and best practices.&nbsp; The answer is no, but if it makes you feel safer it takes only a couple minutes.

				thx for replies.......i suppose i will just have to DL block chain, man-up &amp; work it out.<br />was hoping to just go to bank, transfer cash to bitcoin vendor, come home, transfer bitcoins to SR account, buy gear &amp; then stare at my mailbox for a few days in anticipation.<br />it&#039;s probably not hard to work block chain out but i&#039;ve taken on so much new info in last few days that my head hurts.<br />i&#039;ll be so pissed at myself if i screw this 1st bitcoin purchase up.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m new to this too, and I use blockchain.&nbsp; That&#039;s where I store my coins, sending them to SR when I&#039;m about to make a purchase. I do this as a precautionary step to &quot;separate&quot; transfers and mix it up and also in case SR is down, or gets busted (god forbid), then I won&#039;t have lost my coins.

				If you used bitinstant on an anoymous computer then your bitcoins are essentially anonymous so it&#039;s safe enough to get them directly to your SR wallet, but making a blockchain wallet accessed over TOR doesn&#039;t hurt.
