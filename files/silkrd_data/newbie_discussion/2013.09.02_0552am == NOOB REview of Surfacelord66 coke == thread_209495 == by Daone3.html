				hey, i&#039;m obviously brand new here, and made my first order tuesday morning, with 2 vendors, one with surfacelord for coke and another with another vender that i wont name for some stamps. Well i first msged surfacelord with a noob question about my address and did the same with the other vendor, surfacelord had absolutely no problem replying to me and answered me short and to the point, so i went ahead and ordered a .25 sample. The order from surfacelord was marked in transit about 12 hours later if not sooner, the other stamp order from the other vendor was not marked in transit till about 60 hours later. I got my order from surfacelord66 on thursday 3pm, and i was happy as hell as it was my first order and i was just excited to see that package. The stealth was good (i have nothing to compare it to as it was my first order), the shipping speed was obviously amazing for priority mail, and when i opened it, i was very pleasently suprised, as this was legit fish scale stuff. Broke up in water no problem and no shit left behind (nothing pisses me off more then trying to prep my shot and seeing that its basically all cut, not with this stuff). Well it now monday morning and i still have not recieved my order from the stamp vendor. Pretty dissapointed as i had hoped that maybe just maybe i would get it at the same time or at least a day apart. Kinda killed the point for me a little as now the coke is gone and the stamps will hopefully get here tomorrow. I knew that them getting here at the same time from 2 different vendors in different parts of the country was wishful thinking on my part but like i said a day apart would have worked too. but shit 5 days apart? but anyways Surfacelord66 is the man 5/5 all the way around. I apologize for this review being a little confusing as i was basically trying to review both surfacelord66 superb service as well as my review of my first 2 orders which were made at the same time in general. Anyways, next time im going to order the up and down from the same vendor in hopes of getting it at the same time (only one i seen thats domestic is einsteen, but that was #3 H, which i never tried but it says its basically the same, just add h20 and ready to go and his reviews are excellent as well) Im kinda kicking my self for not saving that fire coca from surfacelord :-(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but you guys know how that goes.....i waited about 30 mins before i decided fuck it, ill jus do this and the shittty quality h i get around the streets here. which made it into more of a speed bump and not a speed ball that i was shooting for (no pun intended)
