For the free Visa;s i go to a non-self checkout line.<br /><br />Here is some of my feedback I have gotten. <br /><br />&quot;I was nervouse at first so i used a few of the grocery ones and they worked fine. After that I used the Nintendo 3DS one and it worked like a charm! I think I will try that one again tomorrow at a different location. I will keep you posted on how it goes. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;So I ordered these coupons not knowing what to expect.<br /><br />They come as individual image files from various legitimate coupon sources from all across the web. Very cool and the smaller ticket items look as if they would have no problems getting passed through.&quot;<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7db68c50d3<br /><br /><br /><br />

				To be clear for people who are interested in this pack, PurpleLotus (the resident coupon guru here) has stated several times that nickmode&#039;s coupons are NOT &quot;exclusive&quot; to SR -- and that they are, in fact, from 4chan.

More coupons, more savings, American Express and Visa Giftcards. Nickmodes pack is both of Purple Lotis&#039;s packs in one. And all for one ridiculously low price.<br /><br />I am a fan of Nickmode for LIFE. &quot;

				So if you have all of the same ones PL has, and PL made each of his individually and exclusively for SR, this implies that you simply compiled his hard work and are selling it as your own.

				If you in fact have all of the same coupons PL has, you clearly didn&#039;t produce them yourself which means you are incapable of providing the excellent service PL gives us all.&nbsp; That is where the value of his product is.&nbsp; PL and his community have compiled hundreds of pages of reviews and tips from real life experience allowing for new users to get guidance into shaving thousands of dollars of grocery bills as well as hardcore items once they feel comfortable.&nbsp; If you want to make coupons and sell them, that&#039;s cool, just don&#039;t try to pass someones work off as your own and then try to dupe new users into thinking your product is the same.&nbsp; Even if the coupons are identical, the value is in the customer care given by the vendor which you can&#039;t replicate.&nbsp; And I believe the 2- coupon packs I bought only cost me roughly $70.&nbsp;

But we do have many many of the same coupons. I mean there are only so many real popular items.<br />We each have the gift cards, the electronics, the paper towels, laundry detergent , popular food items, so so on. Its only inevitable being in the coupon business that our coupon collections are very similar.

And I am very capable of providing the same service as PL provides. Even better service I would say! And im not passing his work off as my own. We have a lot of the same items that out coupons will get our customers. That is just how the coupon business works. <br /><br />I am in the process on creating many more coupons to give to my customers as well. And if my customers have purchased any coupon pack from me, they get all my new coupons for free for life. <br /><br />And if you want to buy PL coupons, they are $100. I dont know where you got $70 from. $40 for the original pack, and $60 for the hardcore pack. And you are not allowed to purchase the HC pack before you purchase the OC pack. <br /><br />And mine are just $20. Its a great deal. But I am going to offer a new collection for $30 in the next week or so.

I shouldnt had said I have ALL the same coupons as PL. I do not. We have plenty of similar coupons, and I have alot that he does not offer at all. Including a American Express Gift Card. This is huge because almost all stores do not stock Visa Gift cards anymore because of all the visa coupons going around. <br /><br />And by the way congrats on the 50th post!

				LOL did you just call me your number 1 competitor? Are you serious right now? We aren&#039;t competing at all man, that insults me. <br /><br />If anyone really wants me to debunk this guy again, I guess I will... but I already knocked him out in the first round? No one wants to see this rematch. I&#039;m not even lacing up this time. <br /><br />You are a blood sucker, posting 4chan coupons, and seeing how many $20 sales you can make. It&#039;s actually a really brilliant idea, just a year late! Trust me, I was the one who originally had it and brought it here, and guess what my first listing cost??? $20.<br /><br />We ain&#039;t competing, you&#039;re being unoriginal but I&#039;m no longer angry about it, I just want everyone to know what you are and who you are, selling the same thing I started here with for the same price I started to sell it for... except you are supplementing your sales with direct lies, while I supplemented mine with excellent quality customer service, honesty, and innovation. Which is my story of how I became the kid selling 4chan coupons for $20, before anyone else did, to the man selling completely custom coupons to SR only. <br /><br />Again... we aren&#039;t competing... I went hard on you the first time, understanding I didn&#039;t have any concern, but wanting to put on a show to deter others. Now, I see you as an asset to me. Anyone who wastes $20 with you, is never going to be satisfied, so then what will they do??? Now it costs them $120 to get to my HC pack. Thank you NickMode, and GL! :-)

				This is a post from PL thread...<br /><br />&quot;Well went to target today and walmart and had trouble.<br /><br />Super Target was first and i went up to the counter and handed her the 6 items i got and the coupons, she looked at them, scanned two of them then looked at them again and called the manager.<br />She came over and looked em over and told me several things,<br />1. Coke doesnt make coupons so that one was fake<br />2. The bacon one was &quot;a ripoff of a target coupon for the same thing by a dollar off&quot;<br />3. They were all fake<br />She accepted maybe 3 of them which took $15 off by $40 purchase to be nice.<br /><br />[..]<br />So they worked there but obviously she knew they were fake but took em anyway,&quot;<br /><br />It seems that too many people have bought PL coupons and they are starting to get recognized and denied at alot of stores.<br />

Even though no one is that stupid to believe it, but it&#039;s a matter of principle. <br /><br />You posted on my newb review thread form a dummy account with 0 posts and then came here and quoted it??? <br /><br />I dare you to do it again...

				You might want to let your potential users now that the 1 cherry picked comment you took was from a user who had just posted in PL&#039;s thread and it was their first post.&nbsp; Not saying it is a fake user but at the very least, you found a person who is very new to the thread/product and went for a cheap shot.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108360.270

				Come on, nickmode -- if you had come here and been honest with people from the start about the origin of your coupons, you wouldn&#039;t be in this situation.&nbsp; As it stands, PL proved that your coupons weren&#039;t original the first time you came around and advertised them weeks ago.&nbsp;

				LOL you just don&#039;t want them to read what was said about you on the first page nickmode... you could really be taking less punches if you just had some sincerity. You are going to piss more people off than just me with this new tactic of yours. You keep raising your post count too Nick! Can&#039;t wait until I see you at 50 posts... then what are you going to do once you can&#039;t take advantage of new users? Delete your thread and start over again at 0? At what point will that be looked upon as abuse and get someone banned?

				LOL no I do not see that just like I never saw your message to me explaining to me your complaint so I could make it right. I do in fact have a reputation for making things right 100% of the time... did you not see my rating? Can you guess the number of times above 300 that is not listed (since it only goes up to 300) that I lived up to that reputation?<br /><br />So you are bashing me, and running to the aid of nickmode, but claim not to be a fake? LOL well atleast with this tactic NickMode doesn&#039;t have to burn his own post count and get himself into big boy forums and out of the newb section as quickly.<br /><br />Hey NickMode... what you are doing right now will in fact get you in trouble, I&#039;m certain of that. I don&#039;t know what kind of security SR forums has, but I&#039;m not stupid enough to jump on and off of forum accounts and not think they can know it&#039;s coming from the same person. <br /><br />&nbsp;LOL you sound so drunk right now... which is funny, because last time it was me. Hey bud, look how you spelled &quot;Slick Robe&quot; in the name fo the thread. Make a coupon? I bet you can&#039;t even figure out how to fix your mistake. $50 says zoobdo claims to buy nickmode&#039;s listing and begins praising it next! I feel like I should not be wasting my time with this petty bullshit and that I have no reason to defend myself as you are no competitor to me, but I&#039;m not wasting my time, I&#039;m protecting people from you.<br />

				zoobdo is not running to the aid of me. He posted a truthful review. And you made a false accusation that I made a dummy account and posted it. <br /><br />And you are STILL denying that he is your customer. Even when he said he purchased from you earlier today. <br /><br />Hey zoobdo, do you think you could post on PL vendor page under your review that you are ACTUALLY a real person, and NOT a dummy account that I made? <br /><br />People need to know that PL is a liar and he is LYING right now. He is trying to get people to believe the truthful bad review that was left by zoobdo was a fake. <br /><br />YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE. THIS IS GOING TO COME OUT THAT ZOOBDO IS A REAL PERSON AND PL IS TRYING TO BLAME ME FOR MAKING A DUMMY ACCOUNT.

I didnt even know you had a thread in the newb section. Nor do i care. So I went to it, I saw Zoo;s post. Laughed, because its funny, because alot of your coupons are bad. And reposted it in my thread. Your customers even stated in your review thread that 6 coupons are listed on the CIC as fake. <br /><br />So think what you want to people. Now that you know PL is a liar and a fake. And is so quick to make excuses anytime someone posts an honest, bad review. haha. <br /><br />I feel like this is the time where my next coupon pack is going to overtake you. I think they way you are acting signifies that your days are numbered. You have to be professional PL. Not act like you are a highschooler. You help your customers, not bash them and call them fakes. You have a lot to learn.

				100% of your coupons are on the CIC database, most from back in 2009... the difference between you and me is that I actually made my entire collection myself, so editing the coupon to completely change them is as easy for me to do. In fact, we are working on changing 100% of our expiration dates, along with family codes and offer codes. Yes, 100% of them, not just the 4 of them you mentioned. This way even if the ones still in current circulation ever get found out by the CIC, it won&#039;t matter, because we already put in the work and changed them.<br /><br />Besides, you should know the CIC website doesn&#039;t mean shit and doesn&#039;t effect the coupon and how it works at all, if it did 100% of your coupons would fail 100% of the time. Instead of your already unstable and unpredictable success rate, even with your low dollar coupons.<br /><br />Now keep my name out your lying mouth... I don&#039;t speak about you on my thread, and if you don&#039;t want me on yours, then don&#039;t speak of me or tell lies about me, oh and start being honest to your customers too. This is officially the last time I warn you before I go grab my Championship belt, and smack you over the head with it again in the most detailed and comprehensive debunk of your product that you could imagine. If you want things to go down like last time where I actually provide documented evidence of your lies... then just say my name one more time. I dare you. <br /><br />(never saw that screen shot of your so called &quot;message&quot; to the fake poster that you both claimed happened before he started defending you, minutes after giving me a fake review) You can&#039;t say my name again without consequences, but I&#039;ll allow you to post that screenshot if you want. Oh and nice fake feedback on your own listing! Very classy.<br /><br />NickMode and PurpleLotus the rematch... I wonder what kind of odds Vegas has on this fight? You are already playing dirty, but I&#039;ll beat you fair and square regardless of how you play. You make it simply too easy on me. Just say the word...<br /><br />Ok, ok, ok, enough with the drama... even I&#039;m tired of it, so I know we are no longer keeping anyone else&#039;s interest. How about we have a friendly competition and do a poll. You can even host the poll on your review thread if you want. We get a neutral party, maybe a forum mod or someone with a really great reputation and we have them name 5 coupons they want to see from us. They pick 5 products and 5 amounts to match each one and me and you have a coupon making contest to see who the Champion is. We then release all 10 coupons, 5 from me and 5 from you to the public on SR and let them vote on the poll to see who can make the best coupons on SR! <br /><br />Of course, if either one of us were to fail to produce all 5 coupons, that would be a disqualification. Oh, unless your confidence is so high that you would like to make this a &quot;loser leaves SR&quot; match?<br /><br />I got two words for ya,<br />PL

There are numerous guides out there on how to make these yourself, as this exploit is years old. Neither of these guys, nor any of the future vendors of such coupons are the creators/discoverers of the exploit...they&#039;re simply profiting off what is free knowledge. More power to them, though. &lt;3<br /><br />When scanned, if a successful barcode manipulation has been done, their register will allow the *discount.* It&#039;s stealing, but people justify it under the guise of using them at walmart/souless corporations, etc. lol

So you can pay NickMode $44 for 4chan coupons which may or may not work and he will have no way to help you cause he don&#039;t know, or you can pay $40 for my collection with 3 times the amount of coupons, all custom made and comes with my full support backed by my solid reputation. The HC set is $60, this is true, but it&#039;s quality work and worth every penny and with the amount of time and effort I put in to presenting a high quality product with excellent customer support is worth every penny and I deserve every penny.<br /><br />You do the math and decide.<br /><br />Oh, and as you had some days of planning and prep to put into this little assault of yours, catching me off guard... I&#039;m about to do the same and return that favor to you. I know you didn&#039;t think I just said if you said my name again that we were going to have a round 2 was an empty threat? A bluff? I&#039;ll see you at the weigh-in. <br /><br />One more thing, welcome to the big boy forums! So far, none of my customers have even seen your bulll$hit posts on here... but now you are about to have to defend yourself to the wolves, and I can take a break and chill and calculate my counteraction to your weak assualt, fake feedback, fake reviews, etc..&nbsp; Luckily I&#039;m not facing a legit opponent where I have to use such tactics, I can just present facts and document them. <br /><br />&quot;PL and I dont have the worst relationship. He puts on this tough guy cover on the forums to make me look really bad and whatnot. He is nicer to me when other potential customers cannot see (in PM&#039;s and whatnot). So i guess I cant really blame him. He has loyal customers, and I have loyal customers. But I am working my way up there!&quot;<br /><br />Yes, you are correct, we largely have a civil and friendly relationship outside of the forums. I&#039;d have to say I almost like you when you aren&#039;t being such a 13 year old faggot on the forums, why did you choose such a role for your vendor ego??? And You are incorrect, you are not working your way up here... I couldn&#039;t even spit on you if I wanted, it would have evaporated way before it reached you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can you please limit your posts to less than 100 words. I cant even get through a paragraph of what you are saying. <br /><br />And PL you are not the smartest person are you. for 1, I have 3 listings. All at $22 each. And they are all the same listings. So its $20 for the coupon pack. Not $40. You failed highscool math didnt you? I am not surprised. And its $20 and what is listed in my $20 listing is what is listed in both your $40 collection AND your $60 collection. Please let me know what is in your OC collection and your HC collection that is NOT in my $20 collection. Please let me know. Because it is not much. SO CUSTOMERS, YOU CAN PAY $20 FOR MY COLLECTION AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, OR YOU CAN PAY $100 FOR PL COLLECTION (WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS MINE) AND HIS GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.&nbsp; We will leave it up to the customers to decide what they want&nbsp; :) :) :)<br /><br />and you keep saying fake reviews and fake feedback. Remember you blamed that on me last night? And you ended up reprting a real customer of your own because you thought it was me? haha. No PL, I do not do that. I let my customers speak for me. And I know you and your die hard customers will bash me like no other. And I will make sure that all NEW customers know that as well. My feedback and my customers will back me. Pretty soon your $100 collection will get no business, and my $20 will get all the business. Its just a matter of time. And youll see me at the &quot;weigh in?&quot; haha. You are retarded. Just do you, and Ill do me. Is it that hard for you? You love internet drama dont you? EVERYONE WILL AGREE. LET ME DO ME, AND YOU DO YOU. EVERYONE WILL AGREE. So stay out. <br />And how am i being a 13 year old? What did I do to you? I can post hundreds of threats you made to me and remarks you made to me for no reason. I think you are being the 13 year old here. And even your most diehard fans will see that as well. <br /><br />And my work is backed and I help my customers with anything that they need. My customer service is why my customers prefer me over you as well. <br /><br /><br />But LOLOL thanks for the hilarity PL. Keep it up man. Youre doing a great job. And thanks for not being able to spit on me because I am so LOW DOWN. It sure seems I am way down by the amount of attention you give me.<br />Thanks for the attention :)

				Vendors can&#039;t report customers like customers can vendors, newbmode. <br /><br />The big advantage to your cheap listing for me is that it almost guarantees anyone who purchases your product will be coming to me next. That&#039;s one advantage you&#039;ll never have.
