				Hi,<br /><br />As you know we pride ours&quot;elves&quot; on ONLY selling Potent DMT.<br /><br />Is this something that appeals to buyers? - I mean do you prefer Vendors who specialize?<br /><br />My own view is that Vendors who sells a large variety of different goods (in general) comes across as being less passionate about their product and more interested in profit?<br /><br />Whats your thoughts / views?<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br />

				Hi MachineElves,<br /><br />I definitely prefer vendors who specialize and I definitely notice and appreciate it when a vendor is truly passionate about his product. I think that some vendors really stand behind their product, especially in the case of psychedelics, and I am sure that being on SR for many vendors is much more than just the profit. Likewise, for many buyers it&#039;s much more than just the drugs. It&#039;s about being part of the revolution!<br /><br />The Bubble Dreamer

				Hahahaha, you really do have bigboypants&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Of course we want to make a profit, like you say all vendors are here to make a profit, but I would like to hope that they are also looking to bring quality and reliability too ;D<br /><br />We have to correct you on your assumption though, it is not profit that drives us.&nbsp; What drives us (our PURPOSE) is a passion to share the benefit that DMT gave to us.&nbsp; Making a bit of money on top of our costs is nice all the same!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />But I guess you missed the premise of my post:<br /><br />My question was &quot;Do you prefer Vendors who specialize?&quot; and was hoping for a discussion on that subject.<br /><br />Thanks for your input all the same, I would say in the case of most vendors you are correct&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Namaste and a Ho Ho Ho&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Once I found reliable vendors with good product, I prefer to use each vendor for&nbsp; what they specialize in.&nbsp; <br />Hope that helps!

				I do like specialist vendors - they tend to know their product well and feel strongly about its quality.<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason why you couldn&#039;t specialise in two or three products though is there?

				Hi Machine Elves,<br /><br />I prefer specialist vendors. But you could specialize in more than one DMT product.<br />I have a MDMA vendor, a weed vendor and a DMT vendor ( yourselves :) ) <br /><br />Thanks<br />

				Definitely go for the specialists cos they tend to have most consistent supply and faster turnarounds than the major shops. Is like any internet business - they&#039;re crap if they take two weeks Uk-&gt;Uk and are cheap knock offs.<br /><br />That said, psychedelics and especially DMT are not exactly a come back for more market so it might pay to add in other similar products like mescaline, acid and 2c&#039;s.

				Providing the other drugs&#039; quality is just as good, then it will definitely pay off.&nbsp; Dmt, and psychs in general are quite niche,&nbsp; by only selling dmt you&#039;ll have quite a limited client base.&nbsp; Standard business development models encourage the increase in range of products

				But I do agree with kinkyjohn. Unless you&#039;re staffed and supplied like a supermarket service will start getting slower like what happened to googleyed

				There is another reason why I prefer specialized vendors: it reduced the risk of a product mix-up. Yes, I know I should reagent test, and I know most drugs are quite well identifiable by taste, smell, structure and color, but I have read anecdotes (not here though) about product mix-ups. And dosing say a 2c-type drugs as if it were methylone would be pretty unpleasant.<br />

				To me, specializing in a product means carrying different grades and complimentary items.&nbsp; Like a coffeeshop or dispensary specializes in cannabis, so the best shops have the highest quality weed obviously but also a selection of more modestly priced lower-quality herb to try and appeal to everyone.&nbsp; Then they have all the extracts, waxes, hashes and edibles to reach the pot-snobs out there (myself included hehe).<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not an experienced DMT user, but I would think you could certainly expand into other routes of administration besides powder.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen listings of DMT mixed with weed, for example.&nbsp; Maybe offer different levels of quality so you could hit a few different price points.&nbsp; Or if it helps to take some certain supplement before &amp; after then you could provide it as a nice gesture, etc.<br /><br />Personally I have no issue with vendors offering multiple products, even if they&#039;re completely unrelated.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#039;ll go to one vendor over another because they do sell other products that I&#039;m interested in, so if the first transaction goes well I&#039;ll know I can depend on them for another substance later on.

				dmt is such an inherently unique experience that I can understand that a vendor would want to specialize, but, if the vendor is going to all the effort of building that vending and mailing system, I think they should feel fine about using it to provide other molecules if they can provide quality.
