				Does he ship with signature required?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend signing for an SR package - especially if the vendor does not usually send it with signature required.

				I have never seen anything saying he does besides one review on his page saying he had to sign for it, I being in the yard when the mail man came by didn&#039;t turn it away.&nbsp; Any thoughts? i&#039;m going to message him and see what he has to say about it.

				He should not have sent with signature required.<br /><br />However, in one of my messages with ST, he said off the cuff that he might start sending all packages with signature. <br /><br />maybe he is doing that but has not made any official announcement<br /><br />ask him

				I wouldn&#039;t sign for one or do business with a vendor&nbsp; that requires signatures. Too hard to tell if it&#039;s a CD or not :-\

				Still no reply from him in a few days,&nbsp; its wired he has always been very quick to respond in the past.<br />Honestly not too impressed with his communication this time around,&nbsp; and I thought he was the most profetional XTC vendor on the road..... Any suggestions on a new vendor to try?

No complaints in that department. In my opinion he is the most professional xtc vendor around. give him another day. i wouldn&#039;t start looking for another vendor because of a minor delay in answering a message. also, sounds like you got your package after signing, so you&#039;re safe. but i understand how that can be unsettling if you were not expecting to sign
