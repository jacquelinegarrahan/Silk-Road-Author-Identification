				admin look into this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/32842c5427<br /><br />on his homepage it says:<br /><br />&quot;Some orders that were marked as dispatched will be cancelled&quot; and then &quot;NB: Cancelling those sucked. So sorry, both to my repeat and new clients. &quot;<br /><br />we are all told vendors delete our information, how that possible when you marked the goods in transit. I am scared as fuck as i got kids and a wife staying with me.&nbsp; someone please help me to stop worrying and tell me i am wrong.&nbsp; his feedback is also looking fake as fuck as i am still waiting for my btc/item but no response.<br /><br />on the seller guide on wiki it says:<br /><br />&quot;You and you alone will have your client&#039;s shipping address. This information must be destroyed as soon as it is used to label their package. When you click &quot;confirm shipment,&quot; the address will be deleted forever and irretrievable. &quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />and then<br /><br />&quot;-Under no circumstance should you save a copy of your client&#039;s address.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Admin save us please, someone get back to me.&nbsp;

				thank you for getting back to me, this topic has be raised before. a long time a ago, also he has clicked dispatched as in item has been sent out. why would he click it if the address not be saved . he would not know where to send it.&nbsp; the message was sent naked, and before you call me stupid&nbsp; privnote was down so was Tor and i am still trying to get the hang of PGP. i just needed the Weed with no hassle free.&nbsp; so i am pissed off but he really let me down. this line he said really made me start thinking.

This doesn&#039;t make any sense to me at all. A lot of vendors put orders &quot;in transit&quot;when they haven&#039;t actually sent the package. This is nothing new. I don&#039;t see where the issue of a &quot;saved address&quot; comes into play. Your item could have been packaged, ready to post, but was pulled at the last minute for whatever reason.

				yes, in a perfect world when a vendor has marked an order in transit what that SHOULD mean is your order is packed up, labeled, and in the mail and on it&#039;s way to you, and all your personal information was destroyed.&nbsp; Unfortunately the reality of things is sometimes vendors get really lagged or something goes wrong and they get incredibly behind, or they are just starting to go rogue, and in order to shut people up and stop getting 50 messages a day they will mark an order in transit although it hasn&#039;t been sent yet.&nbsp; This buys them a few days with that client before they start asking questions again.&nbsp; The point I&#039;m trying to make is SR asks that all vendors delete their clients address after they SHIP the package not after it&#039;s marked in transit.&nbsp; Your vendor may have had all intentions on sending your order at a later time once they had gotten caught up so he marked it in transit to buy a little time but then realized that wasn&#039;t possible and then canceled all orders and deleted all info.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if a vendor holds on to my info for a few days to make sure i get my order.&nbsp; But if you make another order with them 3 weeks from now and they say &quot;don&#039;t worry i have all your info on file&quot;&nbsp; then I&#039;d be fucking worried.

				Most vendors will keep addresses not only after they have been marked in transit, but until they are delivered. This makes sense if the package is lost or undeliverable, they need to know which customer gave them a fake address or whatever the situation is. Vendors should absolutely delete the info after the package is delivered, and it should only be stored on encrypted media.

				wow guys i love you all for the support. It did clear few doubts with this vendor, but with Tor mail being compromised and all it really did made make me worry.&nbsp; I do understand that a vendor could potentially save my address if for tracking reasons, but this vendor accepted the order which meant his intention was to send the goods . SR Seller Guide state that,&nbsp; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide)<br /><br />&quot;Things to avoid <br /><br />Below is a short list of specific things you should avoid. It is by no means exhaustive, but taking any one of these actions could get your seller priviledges revoked:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Leaving fake feedback for yourself from a dummy buyer account<br /><br />Saving customer addresses<br /><br />Claiming to have sent an order when you haven&#039;t<br /><br />Threatening customers&nbsp; &quot;<br /><br />but i believe this vendor has breached &quot;&quot;Saving customer addresses&quot;&nbsp; as how would he know where to send the goods if it was marked in transit ?. Also &quot;Claiming to have sent an order when you haven&#039;t&quot; as he would have never marked it in transit if he had not intention of sending it.&nbsp; even if he was going to send it maybe at later day the details would have been saved to be used at a later day.&nbsp; i am just worried as i am very sure he not an LE but just knowing this just does not help me sleep with the light off. any word of advice would be great.

				I guess I&#039;m just confused.&nbsp; What kind of advice are you looking for?? It seems like you&#039;ve already received this advice which is basically to relax.&nbsp; From what you are describing your vendor got in over their heads, tried to do some creative customer handling by marking unsent orders in transit, and then when realizing there was no way to get these orders to his customers before they started realizing they haven&#039;t been shipped yet and to make sure he didn&#039;t scam anybody by accident he canceled all the orders marked in transit that he couldn&#039;t actually send therefore refunding your coins.&nbsp; From what i can tell your only complaint is that he marked your order in transit without actually sending it yet, and your issue with this is that that must mean he saved your address or else how else would he be able to send your order.&nbsp; I can tell you right now, No vendor deletes your address until your order is delivered.&nbsp; It&#039;s part of what keeps them safe from scammers when an order goes to resolution.&nbsp; This way if you say &quot;hey i didn&#039;t get my package!!!&quot;&nbsp; they can then say &quot;look SR admins here&#039;s the tracking saying it was delivered to this address and here is the address they sent me so it is obvious they are trying to scam me.&quot;&nbsp; So my point is eve if he DID send your package when he marked it in transit he probably wouldn&#039;t have deleted it until you received your package anyways.&nbsp; This is just how things work man.&nbsp; If you really feel you&#039;ve been wronged in someway than contact Support and make your case to them.&nbsp; But all they can do is revoke his vendor privileges.&nbsp; which from what you&#039;ve written it seems like the vendor has decided themselves to quit.&nbsp; So i&#039;m really confused exactly what it is you are looking for.

				thank you odd, for your explanation it make sense now. but this vendor does not offer tracking only first class, therefore saving my address should not be an option.&nbsp; it ok but i know he not an LE but it makes me worry if he gets busted there proof i was a client of his.&nbsp; i have cleaned out my house so i am not sacred, just don&#039;t want this drama with my wife and kids involved&nbsp; over something so small.<br /><br />i can see why he would not mention this to his clients, but does scary me, if i was to give me low feedback as he has something on me.&nbsp;

				i have already contacted SR support but no reply.&nbsp; someone please help me out.&nbsp; i don&#039;t want to get him banned, i just want answer from the man himself. i don&#039;t think a business would simply put all the address stickers on, then scarp the idea throw the envelope with my address and stamp on. how would he then know what i ordered?&nbsp; it pretty obvious that he saving the addresses. but this not for me to decide.<br /><br />can anybody recommended as safe vendor, made an order with cronk but he so slow to reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;
