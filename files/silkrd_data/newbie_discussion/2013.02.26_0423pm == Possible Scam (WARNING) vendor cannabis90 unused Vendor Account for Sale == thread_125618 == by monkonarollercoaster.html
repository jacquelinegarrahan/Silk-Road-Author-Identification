				There are listings in every section of SR currently advertising a vendor account for sale and of course one must FE if they want to buy this account.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how this kind of thing is supposed to work but I imagine that a situation like this must have occurred before.&nbsp; Vendor claims that he expected to have a large amount of cocaine to sell but that the smuggler was busted so now he has no product.&nbsp; The story seems off and he is trying to tell people that their purchases will be protected by DPR despite being released from escrow.&nbsp; He even seemed to indicate at one point that DPR would personally oversee the sale and I could remit payment to DPR himself which is absolutely not the case.&nbsp; Buyer Beware!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />EDIT: Looks to be just in the stimulants section at this time and I may have seen the same listing but thought it was in multiple places.&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/51b6263da4

				Good god.<br /><br />I wish they would change the vendor account into monthly membership fee instead of a one time $500. Fee.<br /><br />Vendor accounts should need to be registered monthly with a fee .&nbsp; At which time sr admin would review the vendor account for any irregularities. <br /><br />Re selling a vendor account means any con man can start ripping people off right away with a great reputation .<br />This is purely sr responsibility to manage vendor accounts more closely. <br /><br />Jeese , everyone is a vendor now.&nbsp; Even.

Use them. Love them.<br /><br />I do actually quite like the idea of a monthly fee if only to prune old inactive vendors, but I think the point is currently that if $500 is a big deal to you then you&#039;re unlikely to be selling anything worthwhile.

				Monthly fee is an interesting idea but I think it defeats the purpose of the current fee unless it is a high amount in place of the current fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it was an add on to the current fee it would be self defeating.&nbsp; There would also be the issue of old vendors loosing their feedback/handle/listings if they took an unexpected and abrupt leave absence.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tricky issue.&nbsp; However this guy has no transactions listed on his profile. It&#039;s really just an issue of him asking the buyer to finalize early which is against the rules for him before having become am established seller.&nbsp; The offer may still be theoretically legit but definitely seems shady to me.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather pay full price and choose my vendor handle and legitimately pay for it direct than to risk a ripoff in order to try save a couple hundred dollars.
