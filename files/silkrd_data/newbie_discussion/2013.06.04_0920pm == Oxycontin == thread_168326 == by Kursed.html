				I&#039;m a new buyer here on silk road, from Canada<br /><br />Been looking for a good supplier with good prices and shipping doesnt take a month to get to me.<br /><br />Im looking for the old Oxys usually labelled - 40 - 80 on the front and OC on the back.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to get a order through with DRXTC for almost a week now, it just kept saying being processed with no response from messages - meaning I have no contact with him at all. <br /><br />Do you guys have any suggestions, as in who do you suggest, length to Canada, good vendors?<br /><br />Thanks in advance, Kursed&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*

				Hey, im a newbie to, but i think your ok with your order. The only problem being that for some reason this vendor doesn&#039;t/won&#039;t reply to messages, presumable because hes just swamped. He has good history, seems like from history its only recently that hes become backed up, anyways yeah a week is a long time that sucks, i placed an order saturday, and it only just now moved from processing to in transit, and because im a newbie and have to FE, i take it to mean that it will go out tommorow.<br /><br />I wouldnt worry about not getting your product, just be prepared for it to take a little longer to get sent out then you were expecting, there is a vender review thread you can check out when you&#039;ve hit 50 posts(i used one of those spam to 50 posts to get my 50)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97508.0<br />thats the vender review link, you can have a look.<br /><br />Also i didnt order oxy(well one) so if my order went out before yours, maby hes just waiting to get some oxies from his supplier.

				Thanks for the response! I ended up cancelling the order figuring something happened or it didn&#039;t go through, as a new buyer contact is necessary for me. <br /><br />In the future i will possibly go back to trying him.

				I know your looking for oxy, but you should consider maby getting some H. I like oxy to, probably better then H, but its soooooo expensive compared to H. And hard to find as im sure you know, from what i could see drxtc was the best around atleast for domestic(which is for the most part a requirement for me, if a package doesn&#039;t have to go through customs that makes me feel alot better).<br /><br />if you do, i would recommend tommorowman(for H), he replied very quickly to my order and shipped it out next day. Also cartel del norte, no response but order went out within 24 hours.<br /><br />I would mention another option besides H and oxy is diluadid, not sure if you&#039;ve ever done them before, i havn&#039;t but i&#039;v read really good things about them, pretty sure i saw some other vendors beside drxtc selling them, worth checking out if you cant find a solid oxy vendor. Good luck!

				Roxi&#039;s,&nbsp; IR&#039;s meaning Instant release oxycodone, the same drug that was in OC&#039;s , except OC&#039;s are time released. The old 0ones could be chewed, crushed/snorted or booted to effectively bypass the time release feature and get all that oxycodone goodness all at once. Roxicodone , is just the same drug, oxycodone designed to be instantly released into your system . Pretty much making them the equivilent to crushing/sniffing/shooting the old OC&#039;s, and they&#039;re much more available than oldschool OC&#039;s.

				Yah the Oxys on here are too expenisve, especially if your in Canada. The Generics are out now and there exactly like the old school ones so you can snort and shoot em. There still new so still kinda rare but Im seeing them more and more.&nbsp; But I can get them way cheaper IRL so thats&nbsp; one of drugs that I refuse to buy here because I got it better IRL.

H is a good readily available alternative with a hell of a zippy feeling for hours if its good.. Terabithia had good quality stuff and takes care of his regulars. had a few shipping errors, but were QUICKLY remedied. <br /><br />

				Ya the cost of 40&#039;s and 80&#039;s are outrages were im from, I prefer domestic because the whole customs things. My friends in my area are all small town and scared of H. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done it once or twice still prefer the oxy high.<br /><br />We have diluadid around here but it also isn&#039;t the same. I&#039;m kind of curious about that roxie thing, I seen it but never figured out what it was till now.<br /><br />Thanks for the info ladies.<br /><br />Kursed

				pretty much the same here. I just like the H more, cause of the duration. I always feel it WAY longer then xy. even the 80s<br />So I&#039;m tooting roughly 30-40mg ($13-15.00) of H and getting 3x more of a buzz than an xy80. ($35-50.00)<br /><br />once a week for me though, don&#039;t want my body getting too used to it.<br /><br />Just food for thought :)
