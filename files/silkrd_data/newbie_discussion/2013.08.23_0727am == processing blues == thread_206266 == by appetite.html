				Morning all, <br />so i have a erm .. predicament on my hands. <br />i placed my first sr order on Tuesday (at about 3 pm), in the hope that i would be having some good times this weekend.&nbsp; ;D<br />the thing still has not been accepted and is still processing which is bumming me out to say the very least. i keep checking a million times a day but there is no change. there are also no updates on the vendors page and i have received no messages explaining that s/he is over stretched. i cannot order more as all my dough is tied into this transaction. i can cancel tomorrow but am thinking of asking the vendor to cancel my order today. although said vendor doesnt stipulate exactly delivery times , their feedback and page does imply quick delivery, which has not happened. <br />would it be bad form to request a cancellation? how does this work? will i be put on a naughty list? will i lose bit coin? how much? should i just wait it out? really dont want to be waiting a week + for my stuff.<br />agh. any advices?<br /><br />was kinda hoping to cancel and then put an order in with someone who is faster.

				Bad form from the vendor regarding lack of communication, especially during the week, you are within your rights to request a refund f it didn&#039;t ship. Regardless, you&#039;re probably not going to get anything for this weekend. Unless you manage to get your coin back in the A.M., order from one of the very best vendors and shell out for express mail, and even then... So you might as well just wait it out a couple days, and maybe your unprofessional seller will come around. Hey, at least you didn&#039;t FE! Way ahead of most the other newbs in that respect.

				i didnt even get the chance to fe , its still stuck in processing. so its not a scam or anything.<br /><br />actually i plan to fe - i know the risks but most coke dealers in my end on the woods on sr specify it for newbs and i can understand why. i m only planning to use the top 1% of vendors with over 300+ transactions so this should be fine. <br /><br />anyway i snapped finally and messaged them to see where they r at, really dont want to have to wait a week for a g, thats a bit crazy imho

				fiveotwo is right on.&nbsp; If enough time has passed where they&#039;re giving you the option of cancelling you should have no hesitation to cancel the order while it&#039;s processing for four days.&nbsp; That&#039;s way too long, especially without a message explaining what&#039;s up.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t placed a ton of orders but every single one I placed was market in transit within 12 hours.&nbsp; If your in a rush find a more prompt seller.
