				That&#039;s a little silly to have ordered a quap if you had other drugs seized and it being the same address, don&#039;t you think?<br /><br />TIP - Move.&nbsp; Stop accepting ANY mail.&nbsp; Return to sender.<br /><br />When talking to the police, anything you say can AND WILL be used against you.<br /><br />Unless they can prove you purchased drugs, you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />DO NOT ACCEPT THE PACKAGE.

				Let this guys FUCK up be a lesson to all of us. IF YOUR DROP IS BURNED DONT ORDER!! THERE WATCHING!!!<br /><br />1.&nbsp; If any package is seized or doesn&#039;t make it to your Drop/Home/Moms/Dads/Baby Moma&#039;s <br /><br />DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE&gt; Your Mistake&gt; Your FUCKED!! IF read below at bottom..<br /><br />SR and others are a high priority target and any packages are tested, back traced, finger printed and DNA tested.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; If you got raided you have been under surveillance and enough probable cause was obtained.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.&nbsp; Once tested a warrant for wire tap&#039;s and surveillance to obtain more evidence. Since you got 50 pills that makes you a dealer in LEO eyes and more of target then lets say 5 pills.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b.&nbsp; Your phone calls, people coming and going are made.&nbsp; If your like 99% of people you talk about your business on your phone and brag about I got tha shiz coming in.&nbsp; DEA has tapped your phone.&nbsp; Remember raids happen with a fews days of planning.&nbsp; You tipped them off as if you had something on you or your home.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Every package to your address is being pulled aside by a warrant and searched.&nbsp; It will not be delivered by postal service, but by an undercover officer.&nbsp; Even if you do not sign for it and its left at your door step.&nbsp; The minute you pick it up bring it inside your doors going to busted down.<br /><br />Even if you think going out for the day that your not being tailed is a joke. <br /><br />TIME TO MAKE A PLAN!<br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Take your hardrive on burn it.&nbsp; Just a wipe reload is not going to save you. USB drives burn those.<br />2.&nbsp; Move your coins to a BTC wallet with no ties to the anyone.<br />3.&nbsp; If you have a smart phone - Master reset.. - This is to reset and delete if they have installed tracking software on your phone which allows to listen in &quot;while phone is idle&quot;&nbsp; Google it.&nbsp; I use it on my kids phones and they freak out when I know what they said.<br />4.&nbsp; Develop an enemy who is trying to fuck you.&nbsp; I can send you pills, weed all day long...&nbsp; Dont go to the visit.&nbsp; Tell them you dont want to and leave you alone.<br />5.&nbsp; Dont go in and talk, its recorded and they will get a confession and say if you help us.. Well get the judge blah blah blah.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Act like a victim of police misconduct and go social media on them.<br />7. Be untrusting of your friends<br />8. STOP DEALING YOUR BURNED!!&nbsp; DEA is on your Ass.<br /><br />THEY ARE TRYING TO BUILD A CASE AND USE YOU AS A BUYER AND SNITCH!&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Unless they have your PGA &quot;going back to 1. time to plan&nbsp; &nbsp;All they have is your address being shipped a package right?&nbsp; Unless your a dealer and a snitch rated you out?&nbsp; &nbsp;Hummm then you need get out NOW!<br /><br />People on here say lawyer up..&nbsp; Well your not arrested, no evidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />MY drop got burned, two controlled deliveries and one knock at the door.&nbsp; Trust me from experience.&nbsp; I always feel Im being watched and I havent ordered in 3 month&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ordered Kratom it got seized. YEAH Kratom its legal, but it tells me my address is burnt on a list.&nbsp; <br /><br />I say fuck LEO and cancel the meeting and say for the raid your upset if they are going to charge you charge me.&nbsp; But if that Weed hits your door..... Well your looking at 3 years Prison... <br /><br />

				Listen mate they cant prove you ordered anything anyone can send anyone anything in the post do not admit to a thing i would give a no comment interview as they are very clever at tricking you into saying things that can have a double meaning i have been interviewed over 30 times trust me give your name address dob and say no comment to everything else and i mean everything right down to them asking if you need the loo while under caution and tape is running say no comment to EVERY question its then there job to prove you ordered or bought anything that my friend they can not prove regardless of how bad it looks its about evidence and they aint got any even if they push 50 pills and 4 oz of weed under your nose they CAN NOT PROVE YOU BOUGHT IT&nbsp; just say NO COMMENT its your right to stay silent and iam sure&nbsp; a lawyer will tell you the same 95% of people get nicked cos of what they said in interveiw good luck and remember NO COMMENT

				get a lawyer <br />remove traces of tor on your pc <br />message the vendor and tell him to improve his stealth so other users who are ordering don&#039;t go through what you are right now <br />&nbsp;<br />i suggest you start working on a story <br />you can always say someone is trying to frame you because you banged their wife :) .. <br /><br />as long as they dont have evidence on you dealing , or taking the drug you will be ok(remember if they raided you , you were being watched and probably still are being watched ) at the end but they will hassle you <br /><br />so sad that people get arrested over these substances whilst alcohol(poison)/tobacco for example is fully legal ... things need to change
