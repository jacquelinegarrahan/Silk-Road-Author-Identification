				They do! If it&#039;s a good question, you&#039;ll get a good answer. I&#039;ve only recently graduated to Jr. Member, but I&#039;m a long time lurker and I learned a lot in this section.

				The signal to noise ratio is bad, but the community is good in the real discussion threads because the barrier to entry is pretty high. There aren&#039;t a lot of total idiots here.

How many times can you post your favourite drug? How awful does every post in a spam thread feel? In my extended tenure as a noob (maybe 4 days, where most people graduate or drop out after what seems like 1) I pined to make posts worth my time, vowed to treat it as I do normal forums. I even made an X Files thread! Oh, lord won&#039;t somebody please post in my X Files thread...<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140046.msg952842#msg952842<br /><br />But anyway here I am, healthy and shameless.. uh, where was I going with this..
