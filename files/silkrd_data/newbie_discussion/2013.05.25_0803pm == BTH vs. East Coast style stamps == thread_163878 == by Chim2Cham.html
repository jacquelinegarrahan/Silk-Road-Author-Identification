				Does anyone know rough potency comparison?&nbsp; I&#039;m from the west coast and there is no powder here, only tar...I ordered some stamps from Deezletime (who rocks, it was my first order and went great, no FE, no delay, Extra bag,&nbsp; Great vendor) but I am nervous about doing too much, Im not sure if they are about the same quality or what.&nbsp; I am from southern california, so most of what we get is relatively uncut, vs. some of the stuff i have gotten up north, in oregon or WA.&nbsp; <br /><br />any insight would be appreciated<br /><br />-Chim cham

				Curious about this too. Just made my first SR purchase with Deezle. How much did you do for your first shot?

				I don&#039;t have a scale, so I had to eyeball it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to figure out how to describe the amount I tapped out of the bag... I made some dots with a standard sized sharpie on a piece of paper, pressing down as hard as I would if I were going to write something, and I would say I did about 5 dots worth.&nbsp; As silly as that sounds.&nbsp; It was enough to feel it, but not to get that full on warmth that we all love.&nbsp; Though its been a few weeks since i have done any opiates, I have been doing K, which hits the same receptors as opiates.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I also freebased some, that was interesting.&nbsp; It turns into a liquid, and was almost as strong as a hit of freebasing the fentanyl gel. <br /><br />Hope this helps, imoscardotcom.&nbsp; feel free to PM me

				I believe that BTH has a morphine and/or 6mam. Said to give it more euphoria and longer legs..<br /><br />I only snort #4, so dont know much about it.

				The stamps seem to be about the same potency as the better BTH I have used.&nbsp; But different highs.&nbsp; BTH is waaaay heavier, this stuff is lighter, kept me up all night (which is normal for me with H.) but way more clean.&nbsp; I dig it, I want to do a shot for shot comparison though.
