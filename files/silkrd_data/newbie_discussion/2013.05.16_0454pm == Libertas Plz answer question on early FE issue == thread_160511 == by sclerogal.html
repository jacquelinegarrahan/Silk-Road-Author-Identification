				<br />Libertas, I have a question for you.&nbsp; What do you do if you are a newbie, and since your purchase count is so low a vendor&#039;s policy is to FE early.&nbsp; I understand under no circumstances your not suppose to FE early, but most Vendors ask that of us?&nbsp; So what do you do?&nbsp; I have barely made 4 purchases since I keep running in to this issue?&nbsp; It says on the wiki that we are suppose to &quot;Report&quot; the vendor if this is the case.&nbsp; I would be reporting every other vendor then.&nbsp; It&#039;s dambed if you do dambed if you don&#039;t.&nbsp; So, how is SR enforcing the policy??&nbsp; Please help us &quot;Noobs&quot;out here.&nbsp; I specifically came here to be anonymously safe, find product needed, and NOT be scammed. <br /><br />I&#039;m an individual that wants to play be the guidelines/rules of this Forum....<br /><br />I also posted this in another message, I wasn&#039;t sure if you would see it....<br />

				Hey guys what&#039;s up? Just wanted to jump in here and say something because this may be a question on the minds of many people who are just joining our community.<br /><br />sclerogal in the meantime there are usually a few different vendors for whatever you are needing so check around to see if you can find one with no FE policy. Also try to find ways to build up your transactions. There&#039;s lots of legit products at very low prices that you may want to look at. The paraphernalia is pretty reasonable and can be shipped to you where you can finalize upon reception and give good feedback.<br /><br />Vendors who have a FE policy for new members do that because they been scammed by new guys who think they can simply order something and not pay for it or they are new and they don&#039;t understand how it all works so the vendors have a policy where you have to have at least 5 or ten transactions and then they will feel better about selling to you.&nbsp;
