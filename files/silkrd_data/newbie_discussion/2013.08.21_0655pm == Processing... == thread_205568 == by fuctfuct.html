				I placed my first order yesterday and it&#039;s also sitting in processing.&nbsp; It was with a different seller than you are dealing with though.&nbsp; It&#039;s my first order so I&#039;m a little anxious to see it actually happen and nervous as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been scammed once and it wasn&#039;t fun, but I trust the vendor I&#039;m dealing with (not sure why that&#039;s the case, but he has great feedback).&nbsp; So I guess we just have to wait and see!&nbsp; You do have the option to cancel your order if you feel it&#039;s taking too long and can find what you want from someone else.

				Always a chance that they&#039;ll come through with extras for your troubles! I wouldn&#039;t leave it any longer after you can cancel if you&#039;re pressed for time though

				Vendors get backed up with orders and whatever, sometimes it takes a few days to leave &quot;processing&quot;, especially over the weekend. While the absolute best vendors will always ship same or next day, taking a couple days for an order to mark &quot;in transit&quot; shouldn&#039;t be cause for alarm. Messaging them every six hours just slows them down even more, so just be patient for awhile. And yeah, really great sellers will give you something extra for the inconvenience. I once got an order doubled for a three day delay!
