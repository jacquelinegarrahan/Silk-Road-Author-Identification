				Greetings everyone! My name is blksheep and I am about to start reshipping, from the U.S,. for one of the top venders on SR (no name can be provided).<br /><br />&nbsp;I have personally contacted quite a few of the known venders offering my services. I can very well manage more than one account at a time. I need the business and will do top notch service for any vender willing to give me a chance.<br /><br />For the MINIMUM, I will provide this: double gloved all the time, packaging the product first in a ziplock bag, vacuum sealing product, then wiping down the vac seal bag with alcohol, inserting vac seal bag into an MBB bag, seal with a straightening iron, wipe that down once again with alcohol, thick A-4 card stock will be folded in half , and the product will then be placed in between card stock and sealed inside a bubble wrap envelope. (for more stealth, I have some methods that I will not discuss openly) The labeling will be printed out and local known business will be used as the return address. DCN (delivery confirmation number) will be provided to the vender to confirm shipment was delivered. Only then will I require payment for services rendered.<br /><br />As for communication, I&#039;d rather keep that private and if an agreement is reached, I will offer my ideas. That being said, you will be the boss and I will only suggest my ideas. All shipments will be out within 24 hours, much sooner usually. Package will arrive in 3-5 days of mailing. (usually 3-4 days)<br /><br />I am easy to get along with. I ask that you make a reasonable offer and I am sure we can work something out. I do not want my name slandered and I need to establish a good reputation on SR. I&#039;ve been around for almost a year and a half. My services will be (hopefully) sought out by the top venders on SR that does not have a U.S. reshipper on staff. I want to be him!<br /><br />I very much look forward to your business and want a chance to help you make money, which makes me money<br /><br />Best regards...blksheep<br /><br />You can message me here on the forum, or SR itself.

				You are essentially selling a service here, so do you have a vendor account?

				Locking this thread until you can show that you have a vendor account.
