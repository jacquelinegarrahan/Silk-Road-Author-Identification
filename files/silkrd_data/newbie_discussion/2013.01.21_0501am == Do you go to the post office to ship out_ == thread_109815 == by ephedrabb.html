				Wondered if people ordered all the mailing supplies and dropped off the packages to mailboxes/ Drop off boxes or if you go into the post office to send out. I knwo you can weigh the package and pay online and print your own label and drop off at a drop off location. i would be kind of scared to go into a post office and try to mail off? Any advice?

				Most order shipped with normal letters and dropped in a mail box, anything that needs to be shipped with tracking/different packaging will pay someone else to go drop it off.

				So would it be safe to have usps drop off the free priority/express shipping supplies then buy my own stamps? And I assume i need to get a scale and make sure I put the exact if nto9 extra postage so ti doesn&#039;t come back? Also, what do I put as the return address?

He just wants to bump his post count to get out. Dunno why he feels the need to make threads and post in actual threads, though. We already have like 10 spam only threads

				Going to the post office is a bad idea. They have cameras in the stores and on the parking lot. If your driving your own vehicle, they could easily get your plate number and find out who you are, and where you live in 5 minutes. Don&#039;t do it.
