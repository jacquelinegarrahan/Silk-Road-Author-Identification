				I&#039;m a little disappointed because I did two transactions, paid for both on Sunday, messaged both on Sunday, and they both messaged me today saying it will go out tomorrow, but one marked it in transit today.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s a case of &quot;under promise, over deliver&quot; or common for vendors to mark it in transit when they contact their customers, even if its not going out that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT: Paid add&#039;l postage on both (&#039;Express&#039; option on one (1 BTC extra) and a USPS option (.5 BTC extra)) - couldn&#039;t they have gotten it out today??<br /><br />Any vendors out there?&nbsp; Anyone else wanna comment and let me know??

				This new guy , sells shrooms for cheap like 210 for 2ozs plus shipping. i ordered and like 2hrs later he sent me a message saying my order had been packaged and would be shipping out within the hour. He has good reviews so far. this will probably change if he starts to get really busy. but im def gonna order from him again bcuz he messaged me when my order was ready and about to be shipped. then a vendor from last week,i wont say no names except that he sells steroids,i placed an order on wed of last week, he didnt mark it in transit until sunday(yesterday) and i get it in the mail today.

				Hi there, <br />I have made a only a few transactions so I could be wrong BUT...<br />I am of the understanding that it is not always so black and white...each vendor is different and I get all my specifics about shipping times via message if i need. Read EVERYTHING on your vendors page first including feedback and that will give you an idea of how they ship. <br />ALSO it you agree to FE before you purchase (a common vendor request made for newbies) you cannot do so until the seller puts the order &quot;InTransit&quot;. Only then can you pay them first<br /><br />For me, one of the many reasons i love SR is because it forces me to be patient and deliberate in my orders. If I really want something tomorrow I seek out vendors that have overnight shipping, even then I expect two days. It is important to remember what vendors have to do and respect..<br /><br />I hope that helps <br />

				I never mark a package &#039;in transit&#039; until it is actually in transit. I feel it would be dishonest to do otherwise, and honesty is something I believe customers really want to see from their vendor.<br /><br />I ship promptly Monday - Thursday. If you order Sunday night you go out Monday. If you order Monday morning you might go out Monday too. I have to ship it anyways, why not just get it to the buyer a day earlier? I never require FE do this also means I get paid a day earlier. When that customer who orders Monday morning is surprised by their package on Wednesday morning (USPS has to do their part though) you might just have a customer for life. People want their shit and they want it now. I know I do.

				Just got a message back from DankHank - said he was &#039;really busy&#039; on Monday, couldn&#039;t get it out until tomorrow, although its already marked &#039;In Transit&#039;.&nbsp; I paid for express, so I&#039;ll see it Thursday, I guess.&nbsp; Paid $18 on Sunday for &#039;Express&#039; and won&#039;t see it until Thursday.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS - he did offer to &#039;give me a little extra&#039; on my next order to make up for it - we&#039;ll see if there is a next time.<br /><br />Still waiting for response from bigbuff - will update with response.

				Unfortunately, it is fairly common. And the sellers that do that are the same ones who are slow to respond to a PM.<br /><br />I have found a few great vendors, but I have also seen vicodin shortages, and high prices.<br /><br />To find the best prices, I&#039;ve sorted the offerings by &quot;Newest.&quot; That&#039;s where the best prices seem to be. It&#039;s only natural that a new seller would offer a better price to attract customers.<br /><br />But, then you are dealing with new and untested vendors. Out of my only 40 or so orders, I&#039;ve had to get my money back from the SR management several times. And a few times without my prepaid shipping cost! And each time it was a long wait and a real hassle.<br /><br />Also, if the vendor chooses to &quot;hedge&quot; the payment, then you will not get all of your money back.&nbsp; Several percent will vanish. I don&#039;t care if the order gets cancelled after only 5 minutes, you will lose 3 or 4 percent.<br /><br />One last comment--something that really bugs me--when buyers get shitty service for no good reason. Like taking weeks for either the product or a refund, no communication, rude communication, or whatever--the buyer will STILL gives the seller a 5 out or 5. WTF? How is the next buyer supposed to be forewarned? The best solution is to find good vendors and give them your business.<br /><br />Good luck fellow newbies<br />JeanRob

				bigbuff responded 13 minutes ago (its funny how I decide to check for the first time of the day and it usually within minutes of receiving the message.), but he says he marks the package as In Transit when he prepares the box (labels it, etc...) -sometimes he can make it out the same day, sometimes the next day - he says I should receive my package by Friday or Saturday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Reminder - paid for the add&#039;l &#039;USPS&#039; shipping option on Sunday (.56 BTC, $8-$9), will receive Friday or Saturday.<br /><br />Both of these vendors are DOMESTIC to the US, shipping to the US.<br /><br />I think this is kinda rediculous, anyone else?
