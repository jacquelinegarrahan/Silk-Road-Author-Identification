				I&#039;d try to avoid WU transfers<br /><br />Have you checked out Localbitcoins?&nbsp; Direct bank deposits work well, as do personal meets.

				Hi I am new here and had a hard time figuring out how to purchase bitcoins in South America. Not having a US bank account etc.&nbsp; First like Yoda (and there is another forum topic about this) NEVER send anyone money via WU.&nbsp; If you do you might as well just light a fire and toss your cash in.<br /><br />What I did (and it takes a little time to setup but it is awesome)&nbsp; was set up my PayPal account in the US and then got a business debit card attached to it. I then went to https://www.btcquick.com/beta/&nbsp; and signed up for an account.&nbsp; <br /><br />It took the best part of the afternoon to get my account set up and verified, but once it was set up I got my bitcoins instantaneously. Very good service, very fast and reliable.&nbsp; It was easy to <br /><br />Great for newbies like myself who don&#039;t the patience.<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />
