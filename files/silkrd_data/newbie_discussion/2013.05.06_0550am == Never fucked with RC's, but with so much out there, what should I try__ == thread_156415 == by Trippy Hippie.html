				I&#039;ve never really fucked with research chemicals... Smoked pot, done shrooms, haven&#039;t tried acid, mescaline or DMT yet, but those I&#039;m real excited too. Also ecstasy, to some extent, if it&#039;s good. But I&#039;m mainly into psychedelics.<br /><br />Lately though, I&#039;ve been seeing TONS of RCs on the road and talked about in the forums. Which would you recommend I try?? What&#039;s most important to me is that it&#039;s a pleasant or deep experience and it doesn&#039;t physically harm me. Are most research chemicals safe? I&#039;m talking like as safe as acid or booms or weed, as in no real known cases of ODs. I definitely only want to put practically nontoxic substances in my body. And I don&#039;t want something that&#039;s gonna scare the shit outta me or whatever. Also, nothing with a hangover or withdrawal period. And preferably only drugs that have a very low potential for addiction, though I do not have an addictive personality.<br /><br />Pretty much, I want to play it safe and just have fun, mainly on the psychedelic path. That being said, which research chemicals (or other drugs for that matter) should I try? I want to be open to exploring new experiences, experiencing new trips. Thanks for your suggestions!!

				uhhh WTF YOU GUYS<br /><br />OP asked for safe and non-addictive drugs and you listed a-pvp and meph?!!<br /><br />seriously dude if you really want to fuck with RCs go with 2C-B.&nbsp; it is the best 2C, hands-down, especially for someone who hasn&#039;t had much experience with psychedelics (imo of course).&nbsp; i fucked myself up really bad playing around with these and MANY more chems and after having eaten a garbage bag full of sloppily labelled off-white powders in my lifetime i can tell you to just stick with the shit that actually has an established history of human usage.&nbsp; get some acid or some ketamine or some mdma (mda might be more up yr alley in this situation actually) with the money you would&#039;ve had to spend buying a shitty and unreliable milligram scale anyways (trust me you really can&#039;t afford a nice one) before you could even dose some of these chems properly and get high off that shit, its safer, feels way better and is easily accessible here via the road..<br /><br />now, with all that warningy shit that you already hopefully know out of the way, i can tell you i swallowed around 450mg of 4-aco-dmt once (long story) in the hopes i could puke the bag back up (WRONG) and had to spend a very very long time in the emergency room, seeing radiant heiroglyphics and some form of alien language that seemed like it was from the dawn of time scrawled everywhere, all the while nurse after nurse has to come in and ask me &quot;what i&#039;m seeing&quot; cuz they are all so fascinated by the fact that i was tripping my fucking soul out.&nbsp; all that said, i was perfectly fucking fine, my heart rate wasn&#039;t even elevated, and in the end the plastic bag probably did more damage than the drugs did.. it took me a really really long time to get back to a baseline (around a month) tho and i was suffering from very very bad HPPD (i couldn&#039;t even read or get online, it was so overwhelming) for about 2-3 months after that.&nbsp; i still have some light HPPD years later that i do notice when i read/watch movies or if i&#039;m driving sometimes.&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t really bother me anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyways i guess what im trying to say is that being a human guinea pig for drugs that nobody understands at all is what it is.&nbsp; yr playing with fire so i really hope you&#039;ve read up on yr shit and know what the hell yr getting yrself into.&nbsp; the truth is that most research chemicals are never really &quot;safe&quot; (as you&#039;ve already stated), but you can practice harm reduction if you really wanna go down that rabbit hole..&nbsp; bluelight was always actually a pretty good place to learn about this stuff when i was into it, idk now i haven&#039;t logged on in ages but i&#039;m sure they still have the &quot;Big &amp; Dandy&quot; threads for specific chems that can tell you absolutely everything you&#039;d ever want to know about most RCs, good and bad. maybe check that out??<br /><br />also i&#039;ve seen more people lose it and have a terrifying experience on the 2cs and nbomes than anything else, and they almost all (with hte exception of 2c-B imo) come with a heavy, heavy body load and general feelings of &quot;toxicity&quot;.&nbsp; they tend to lack the euphoria most people associate with &quot;classic&quot; psychedelics as well.<br /><br />tl;dr - if you don&#039;t know your shit and just start swallowing chems, YOU&#039;RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME <br /><br />hope something there was useful/informative for you

				Hey thanks heavyreader for the long replies! :) I found them both helpful and informative.<br /><br />Since posting this I did a little of my own research... I&#039;m glad I did because I was really thinking about ordering the Tyler Tabs or whatever those top selling 25i-NBOMe&#039;s are called. For being that cheap, they seemed like a legit deal.. Until I went on Erowid and saw that people have OD&#039;d on them and anything over 800ug is considered a strong dose - the Tyler Tabs are dosed at 1200ug each. Fuck that!<br /><br />You mentioned 2C-b. Definitely interested, if it is as pleasant as it sounds (both from what you said and what I&#039;ve read on other sites - and it&#039;s the most popular 2C drug on the road). What exactly is it like and how does it compare to acid or shrooms? Also, if anyone&#039;s willing to give me a break down of the differences in the whole (or as many as you know) 2C family, that would be super helpful! Thanks ahead.<br /><br />At this point, from a little outside research, the only other RC I&#039;m interested in would be 4-HO-MET. I&#039;ve seen a couple people say it feels nice/euphoric with good vibes/empathy, visuals and not a strong bodyload. Does this sound right? Could anyone verify that or describe their own experience with it?<br /><br />Ultimately, your point (heavyreader) about sticking to the &#039;classics&#039; makes a lot of sense. As of now, I love and respect mushrooms so much, and look forward to feeling the same about acid. LSD, mescaline and DMT are definites for my future. And likely the ones I&#039;ll stick to. One last question though, you also mentioned ketamine as a classic? I know practically nothing about that drug. Is it a psychedelic? What&#039;s it like? Oh and (I lied, this is the last) why do you say MDA sounds like it&#039;d be better than MDMA for me? What exactly is the difference?<br /><br />Sorry for the bombardment of questions. Anything anyone wishes to share is much appreciated! :)

I was talking to a pharmaceutical rep quite a long time ago and he basically said as much testing as they do for the FDA and all that, drug companies really have no idea what the drugs are gonna do until it&#039;s approved and out on the market. So that should keep you up at night.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t try to categorize drugs into RCs and not-RCs. ALL drugs are chemicals. Just treat them that way. I&#039;d suggest you try shrooms first. They&#039;re really good here, good quality and good price. They&#039;re a very gentle psychedelic, but they&#039;re still cool as shit. After that, many people rave about MDMA, though I never liked it myself apart from the part where the drug itself forced me to like it. If you like Shrooms try DMT, Ketamine and I&#039;ve been really looking forward to trying DMT WITH Ketamine. 2c-b is a good starter phenethylamine. And once you have experience with those and you know what you like, you can keep exploring similiar stuff. You liked Ketamine? Try MXE or 3-MeO-PCP. Like MDMA? Try methylone or whatever. Like 2C-B? Well there&#039;s scores of 2Cs. DMT got you off? There&#039;s LSD, NBOMe, and all sorts of crazy shit.

				I was getting good quality MDMA crystal where I live from last May up until late October. After that I noticed that the shit I was buying (from the same folks) had changed. At first, I thought I had simply lost the &quot;magic&quot; and needed a good long break. Gave it 6 weeks or so and tried again, and again, and again. Same bullshit. Got a Marquis and Mecke reagent kit and turns out every batch bought locally since the first of the year was fucking methylone. Straight fizzy yellow bullshit! If you&#039;ve ever tried the real deal and are expecting to be satisfied with M1 (methylone) you&#039;re going to be let down. It can be sort of fun I suppose but it makes you want to keep redosing because the comedown sucks big donkey balls. I went through an entire G in one night once. Felt like absolute shit for the next day or two. You can&#039;t sleep, very little euphoria and it made my fucking heart pound for hours! I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews that said it&#039;s one of the closest RCs to MDMA and I guess some people enjoy it. Just giving you my personal experience. I will never get fooled again and won&#039;t tough that M1 junk. Of course, there&#039;s a silver lining to every story. After testing about 3-4 batches between myself and a friend of mine I was bewildered and depressed that the real deal was gone in my area. Will it ever come back? Who knows? Until folks stop buying this M1 passed off as &quot;molly&quot;, the local dealers will keep selling it. My disappointment and frustration over the local X drought turned into a determination to find the real shit somehow, someway. That&#039;s when it happened. One magical night after work surfing the web, I stumbled on a post somewhere (I don&#039;t even remember where I first read it) about the SR. Since that glorious day (after much research and contemplation) my life is changed forever thanks to this ingenious market and system we all love. Sorry, I was really just trying to give you a heads up on M1 and got a little wordy, lol. It&#039;s the only RC I&#039;ve tried and it was unintentional at that. My 2 cents...it&#039;s like almost rolling and then you some down and feel all creeped out like a fiend. I&#039;m sure some will disagree but that was my take on it. I&#039;ve read nothing but good things about some of the 2C family of RCs but have yet to try. To others reading this, which 2C-x would you recommend for a first timer keeping in mind that my faves are MDMA, just about any opiate/opioid, weed and alcohol of course? I&#039;m all about a strong body buzz. The psychedelic head space shit I could take it or leave it.

I&#039;m glad I did because I was really thinking about ordering the Tyler Tabs or whatever those top selling 25i-NBOMe&#039;s are called. For being that cheap, they seemed like a legit deal.. Until I went on Erowid and saw that people have OD&#039;d on them and anything over 800ug is considered a strong dose - the Tyler Tabs are dosed at 1200ug each. Fuck that!<br /><br />You mentioned 2C-b. Definitely interested, if it is as pleasant as it sounds (both from what you said and what I&#039;ve read on other sites - and it&#039;s the most popular 2C drug on the road). What exactly is it like and how does it compare to acid or shrooms? Also, if anyone&#039;s willing to give me a break down of the differences in the whole (or as many as you know) 2C family, that would be super helpful! Thanks ahead.<br /><br />At this point, from a little outside research, the only other RC I&#039;m interested in would be 4-HO-MET. I&#039;ve seen a couple people say it feels nice/euphoric with good vibes/empathy, visuals and not a strong bodyload. Does this sound right? Could anyone verify that or describe their own experience with it?<br /><br />Ultimately, your point (heavyreader) about sticking to the &#039;classics&#039; makes a lot of sense. As of now, I love and respect mushrooms so much, and look forward to feeling the same about acid. LSD, mescaline and DMT are definites for my future. And likely the ones I&#039;ll stick to. One last question though, you also mentioned ketamine as a classic? I know practically nothing about that drug. Is it a psychedelic? What&#039;s it like? Oh and (I lied, this is the last) why do you say MDA sounds like it&#039;d be better than MDMA for me? What exactly is the difference?<br /><br />Sorry for the bombardment of questions. Anything anyone wishes to share is much appreciated! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />well 2c-b i would say is definitely the most euphoric and empathic of the 2c family.&nbsp; its very different from shrooms or lsd, i find it to be a really great party drug and if i&#039;m going to a festival or something and i wanna drop its always gonna be 2c-b, some people feel that its not as &quot;deep&quot; as lsd or shrooms and i&#039;d have to agree on that front, but you will definitely have visuals altho they mostly consist of very very heavy tracers (my favorite tracers!!) and visual distortion (cartooning, warping) along with some nice color effects.&nbsp; its the most popular for a good reason, not too much mindfuck but a very beautiful experience<br /><br />the other 2c&#039;s are very different, 2c-t-7 would probably be my next choice, once again, it&#039;s a very &quot;mind candy&quot; kind of experience, fairly long-lasting, very distinct visuals, this is probably the last 2c that i would consider &quot;fun&quot; in the uplifting, ecstatic sense.&nbsp; 2c-t-2 is much more heady, and often makes me nauseous/puke.&nbsp; 2c-i has an INTENSE body load thats a little overwhelming, tho i really think that 2c-i also has the most interesting visuals of almost any psychedelic, but 8-10 hrs is a long-ass time to be that far out, i once had to help talk some guy out of killing himself with a pocket knife, he&#039;d never tripped before and could NOT handle it, at all.&nbsp; im pretty sure he tried to eyeball it, too, which really reinforces again the necessity of a milligram scale.&nbsp; there is no reliable way to eyeball a chem that you&#039;ve never done before, and even ones that you have a lot of experience with can be deceiving, and if you take more than you planned for you&#039;re gonna have a bad time&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />somebody else can hopefully chime in on the rest of the 2c&#039;s, i really don&#039;t remember a lot about 2c-e or 2c-p except heavily disliking them both, and 2c-p lasting fucking FOREVER.. like not AMT long, but shits got legs..&nbsp; <br /><br />as far as ketamine, technically its a dissociative, and is a great party drug in little bumps and lines, but if you really go for the gold, especially IM injection (thigh, butt cheek), you will k-hole, and its all-consuming in the way dmt is, but is absolutely nothing like dmt.&nbsp; and btw, good pure ketamine is incredibly safe in the right doses.&nbsp; its actually used as an anesthetic for newborns and elderly people..&nbsp; i could try to describe the experience but you&#039;ll probably get a much better idea of it by reading trip reports n shit on erowid.&nbsp; btw john lilly is probably one of the most interesting and brilliant (and equally batshit crazy) figures in the counterculture pantheon (i feel like that word is not being used correctly here), and ketamine was his drug of choice.&nbsp; reading some of what he has to say about it will probably help you too, beyond being just fascinating, as long as you don&#039;t accidentally cross into &quot;cosmic dolphin&quot; territory too quickly..&nbsp; <br /><br />mda is like mdma, but slightly less euphoric and much much more psychedelic.. i prefer it to mdma, but it&#039;s definitely not something you&#039;re gonna party all night on lol. with mda you&#039;re gonna sliiiiiide into a chair and just melt.. its longer lasting as well.&nbsp; but if you&#039;ve never done mdma i seriously recommend it, just go for it, it&#039;s fun as hell<br /><br />hope that answers ur questions!&nbsp; i know how confusing it can all be.&nbsp; wish i knew more about 4-ho-met, i have never heard of it..<br /><br />i don&#039;t see dpt anywhere around right now btw but if you ever find yourself in the position to try it and you&#039;re willing to take the plunge, a small amount insufflated gave me the most horrific/disturbing/painful psychedelic experience i&#039;ve ever had, it haunted me for weeks but when i finally came to terms with what i&#039;d seen/felt, it changed my life in a way that no other substance really has.. powerful teacher but nothing to play around with.. the only way i&#039;ve ever really known how to explain the experience is that its like having surgery done on your soul with no anesthesia..&nbsp; very dark but your unconscious shows you the face you show it..

				Here&#039;s what I have done, mostly psychedelics:<br /><br />1. 25D-NBome - for me the coolest n-boom out there. Don&#039;t take too much though, and always do an allergy test (i.e a smallish dose) to see how it hits you.<br /><br />2. DOI - Be prepared to trip for a looong time (~16+ hours). Not the greatest drug, but mind-blowing for sure. On a 1.6mg tab I was convinced that humanity is a virus (that feeling has not left me since..)<br /><br />3. 25C-NBome - A lot like acid, but not that powerful. Its a fun chemical though.<br /><br />To reiterate, if you muck around with NBome&#039;s be careful of the dosage, in my experience going from 1 tab to 1.5 tabs was a gargantuan leap.

				At the moment have been doing the Tyler Tabs, usually take a couple per session. One then another hour or two later, mind you I drink alcohol with it, so end up really buzzing, perfect for partying, can go all night but have to eat or end up with a splitting headache next day....don&#039;t know what all these people are saying about doses over 800. Was a big 2CI user for a couple of years, but agree, heavy body load. Never weighed things out, just wet the tip of my finger and dipped into my bag. Did have some nights where definitely took too much seeing and hearing these almost ephereal insects swirling all round me! My drug of choice however is the 4MMC. But have a real problem with re-dosing...always turns into an all night binge.
