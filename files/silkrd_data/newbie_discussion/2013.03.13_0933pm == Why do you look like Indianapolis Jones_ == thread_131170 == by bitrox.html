				Ricky: The thing with kids and growings and getting learnings and stuff is that... You can&#039;t lie to them. Basically, if you wanna tell the children they can&#039;t do something they&#039;re gonna want to do it more. When I was young I did all kinds of crazy shit and I turned out wicked. That&#039;s because my dad was fuckin&#039; cool, he let me do shit. I was allowed to drive his car around the park, basically took my dirt bike to school, let me grow dope in his shed in grade 7. You know, that&#039;s what good parenting is all about. You gotta let them have a bit of freedom.

				Julian: Ricky, I&#039;m telling you, you gotta stop growing pot.<br />Ricky: Come on, man, you can&#039;t tell me to do that.<br />Julian: I&#039;m serious Ricky.<br />Ricky: You can&#039;t tell me to do that. It&#039;s like telling the NWA to stop being black.

				J-Roc raps about gangsters &amp; guns, pimps &amp; hos and Compton. The guy&#039;s not from Compton. He&#039;s a white kid from a trailer park. He should rap about what he really knows which is living in his mom&#039;s trailer eating peanut butter sandwiches.

				Randy: I can&#039;t get stoned, Ricky.<br />Ricky: What do you mean? It&#039;s shitty work. Everybody does that, all right? Carpenters, electricians, dishwashers, floor cleaners, lawyers, doctors, fuckin&#039; politicians, CBC employees, principals, people who paint the lines on the fuckin&#039; roads, get stoned, it&#039;ll be fun, get to work! Oh, and this is the most important, go down to the Shit-Mart. I need a bag of chicken chips. If they don&#039;t have chicken, get me dill pickle. And I want a chocolate milk.

				Mr. Lahey: Why don&#039;t you get a life Rick? Why don&#039;t ya go to community college like Julian here. Hey, I got a good idea. You could teach, livin&#039; in a car and growin&#039; dope 101.<br />Ricky: Hehe. And you can teach how to get drunk, get fired from the police force become a... lousy trailer park supervisor that sucks, hangs around with a fuckin&#039; idiot that doesn&#039;t wear a shirt and looks like a dick but thinks he looks good... 101.

				Ricky: I try to be a role model for kids around the park. If some kid wants to grow dope, they can come talk to me, instead of growing dope 6 or 7 times through denial and error, they&#039;re going to get it right the first time and have some good dope.
