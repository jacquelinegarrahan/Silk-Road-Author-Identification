				Ha, I know the stuff it sells is illegal. Or most of it. I was just wondering, if actually visiting the website, and purchasing something not illegal (say a bug sweeper) is illegal. Because I saw a discussion about sending bitcoins directly to SR may be dangerous, but if they can&#039;t prove you bought anything illegal from here, is it illegal to have visited it? <br />Thanks

				Interesting thought.<br />I would assume that maybe it could still be considered funding a criminal activity with your prior awareness, seeing as you obviously know that SR is a drug trafficking service and you using it helps to fund pretty much everyone involved in some minor way.<br />But I do not have enough legal knowledge to answer with any authority.

				my guess is that its probably not illegal by itself, but it would be used to further prove other illegal activities either real or imagined.

				I believe that SR is illegal in the eyes of the law as it is offering a platform for illegal activities, mainly that its a black market which means tax avoidance. Thats the big law breaking. Using it however is not illegal, you can be looking with no intention of buying and also there is legal things for sale also such as paraphenalia and other items. instruments etc.

The fact is the law is so flexible. That&#039;s why we need judges, juries, and lawyers. One DA in one court in one state could get a conviction easily using just the existence of SR, your visiting it, communications with the vendors and possession of BTC. Another DA, another state (or fed court) would have to show actual purchases and clear intent. You just don&#039;t know, though if you look at who the judge is, who the prosecutor is and the conviction rate of similar offenses you might be able to make a SWAG. Some of us on here now would be convicted, some wouldn&#039;t.

				Noobie here! Second post! Hello Silk Roaders. I came for the drugs but found a revolution. <br /><br />Heard about the SR at a music festival last week and we had this exact discussion.<br /><br />Browsing on here is not illegal. The actual website is only providing a platform for vendors so I believe that is not illegal. However, SR makes a commission on the sales of goods and I doubt DPR files a tax return! Or do you DPR? you law abiding citizen you!<br />

				yeah I always figured it be near impossible for them to get ALL the proof they needed in the circumstances, unless you literally have no common sense. Just use SR for your purchase/purchases, and wait a day if you want (its not that long) to finalize them. Dont leave stupid traces on your computer. As long as you are dealing with a trustable and reliable vendor you will be good.

				my guess is, if you are a target, there will be a way to connect the dots and nail you.&nbsp; but, there&#039;s usually a way out.&nbsp; what vendors should be worried about is buyers being coerced into cooperating with LE.&nbsp; let&#039;s face it.&nbsp; vendors are the real target, but buyers are the easier prey.&nbsp;

Based on what I have been seeing I think there will be a push against SR coming relatively soon (months, maybe within a year) by LE and prosecutors looking for headlines. And it will begin with turning buyers against vendors and cutting deals and then turning vendors against suppliers and eventually trying to infiltrate SR admin. I&#039;m wondering if anyone is looking ahead and developing countermeasures against LE putting their tools and people into a serious intrusion of SR? Not just gathering intel but an intrusion that would scare buyers away. Without buyers SR cannot survive.

				No - it&#039;s not illegal at all to buy something legit here. You should send your coin straight to your SR wallet though, because regardless of the fact that it&#039;s legal to use the site legitimately, letter agencies are still going to view it as if you are visiting SR to buy drugs.<br /><br />My dad and lots of other guys I know read Playboy for the articles. Same thing with SR.
