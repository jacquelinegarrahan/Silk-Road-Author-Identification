				Yeah, LSD test kits would be fantastic.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t looked into them much, but it seems the erlich test is thought of highly here.&nbsp; NiK tests too.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Well i looked up the NiK tests, they are a brand of reagent test kits which are very expensive.&nbsp; i will be offering my own reagents which are made the same way as NiK.<br /><br />i&#039;m glad to see the interest in specifically LSD testing, as this is the exact reason i decided to learn how to make reagent test--i want to test my LSD. the Marquis and the Ehrlich tests will be the best test for LSD,<br /><br />turns black under marquis (also marquis reacts with RC&#039;s commonly sold as LSD, so if it does not turn black you should be able see what you actually have)<br />with ehrlich and LSD the reaction becomes pink/purple (as well as any other tryptamine such as DMT, psilocybin, 4aco, etc... this is also why its good to test with both marquis and ehrlich...<br /><br />@ThisSHITS<br />i will be offering these test for about half the price&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah, I&#039;ve got the Marquis, but it seems like everyone holds Erlich as the standard.&nbsp; Any reason for this?

				ThisSHITS<br /><br />i don&#039;t know what bottles your talking about, i will be using LDPE plastic dropper bottles. like i said i am mixing these reagents myself going off of the same measurements and chemicals of the department of justice.<br /><br />a little piece should work fine, some people use a 1/4 of a hit but i just use a tiny piece of the corner... it slowly fades into a purple color.<br /><br />Icon<br />Erhlich is the standard for LSD because it reacts for tryptamines as a purple color, and as far as i know there are no tryptamines that is powerful enough to even have a threshold at below a few mgs. <br /><br />here is a pic of LSD (right 2) and 25i nBome (Left 2) with marquis (top 2) and erhlich (bottom 2)<br /><br />hxxp://static.dyp.im/mV94tYuPYZ/0580880810aebe86c3f1116baca1d5b8.png
