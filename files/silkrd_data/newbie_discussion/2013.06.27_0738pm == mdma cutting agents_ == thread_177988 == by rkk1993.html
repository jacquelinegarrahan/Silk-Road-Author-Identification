				Ok does anyone know what the best thing to cut mdma is thats not bad for you. I&#039;m not doing it to sell that way. It is for me to snort. I wana snort mdma when I do it but don&#039;t like the harsh crushed crystals. I want to cut it with something so taking down a couple of lines will be easier

				Inositol or even Caffeine will take the edge of it. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t see why people rack lines of MDMA, never felt the effects were as good as either bombing or plugging.<br /><br />In the right circumstances plugging is definitely the right way to go, you can dissolve the dose in water and use the plunger of a syringe (without the sharp) to administer rectally avoiding the uncomfortable feeling of the pill/capsule breaking down as it begins to be absorbed. Still, wash your hands when you are done...&nbsp;

No offense to anyone that does this but it just doesn&#039;t seem fun. Part of the fun of snorting mdma is actually the snorting in my case. I just love snorting it because its a rush of euphoria and im able to just fucking go! when I eat It I think you do get the more psychedelic effect of it and I just wanna lay down and cuddle with anything around.

				To answer weather420 - inject is probably the wrong word because there is no needle involved. But yes - did you think I was making it up? <br /><br />And in reply to rkk1993 - I did say &quot;In the right circumstances plugging is definitely the right way to go&quot; - this is obviously impractical in lots of situations. In situations where it was impractical I would bomb it rather than rack it, because it just doesn&#039;t feel the same to me. This is only from my personal experience but I think there is something to be said for having the lot in one go, not sniffing lines for 15 mins and then trying to get all the drip to flow through. <br /><br />Just my opinion, I think the method of plugging I mention is invaluable. Although I feel the same way as you, sticking stuff up my ass isn&#039;t my idea of a good time. However plugging does pack a bigger punch, and that method mentioned eliminates a lot of the discomfort.

				I would consider plugging how long do the effects last compared to bombing. one reason I dont like just dropping crystals is it last like 6 hours. which is nice sometimes but normally I like to be sober in less than four.&nbsp; <br />If i dont have the syringe lying around the house do you know of something else that could be used?

				I don&#039;t know why the duration concerns you so much, i mean generally people want to roll as long as possible haha<br /><br />The duration for plugging is less than bombing, its closer to slamming I believe. Quicker more intense come up, less plateau <br /><br />Substituting is tricky, I don&#039;t really keep anything that will do a similar job on hand. Once you have taken the sharp out of the syringe or just purchased a tube and plunger, you just keep it, don&#039;t see it causing any problems reusing it. Its not like you are going to carry it around with you to a club, mine lives in my first aid box.

				the duration concern is because i normally have a lot to do i work upwards of 60 hours a week and take online classes for college at night. I dont really go out to party its not my thing and im home from college this summer so i normally have to go somewhere else to do it like a local mountain is my favorite place to roll with my girlfriend. so if I get a window to do something its normally short and i want to still make it to sleep at a decent time because ill be at work at 6:30 in the morn. Thats one reason i just rail it because i can do it while driving somewhere like a movie theatre and by the time im out im able to drive again.

				If you are only concerned about getting to sleep maybe try some xanax or valium. Given the nature of what you are doing, the method I discussed earlier is probably ideal, just suss out how you can get hold of an insulin syringe and then you are good. Like I said more intense but shorter duration, fits the bill by the sound of it.&nbsp;
