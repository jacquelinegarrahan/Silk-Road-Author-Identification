				Hi guys,<br /><br />Quick summary: I created a bitcoin account using LocalBitcoins.com, then arranged a local purchase (face to face) of bitcoins with a reputable dealer (a friend advised this as he suggested it was more anonymous than buying bitcoins with a bank transfer or Paypal).&nbsp; The bitcoin purchase went through without any major issue.&nbsp; I have since transferred some bitcoins to my Silk Road account and made a purchase.&nbsp; I have no reason to believe the guy I bought my bitcoins from was law enforcement or law enforcement connected, but I have since read that the best way to buy bitcoins with maximum anonymity is via cash deposit.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; what is my best course of action for buying in future: should I cease using my current localbitcoins.com account for buying on Silk Road and create a new one?&nbsp; Should I cease using my Silk Road account as soon as possible and open a new one?&nbsp; Should I just create a new Silk Road deposit address?<br /><br />Background: I use Tor for everything Silk Road or bitcoin related, I&#039;ve used PGP to encrypt my details for the actual Silk Road purchase.&nbsp; The guy I bought my bitcoins from knows my face and a phone number which is traceable to me if the phone company was to give out my information (I will soon be changing my phone number).&nbsp; He does not know my real name, or address.&nbsp; He did ask me what I was going to be buying with the bitcoins, and I gestured with a &quot;I&#039;m not telling&quot; sort of response, which I&#039;m sure he knows what I mean (stupid of me, I know.&nbsp; I should&#039;ve been more careful).<br /><br />SO.&nbsp; I believe everything I&#039;ve done is safe other than the bitcoin transaction itself, so that transaction is the weakest link here.&nbsp; Again, I have no reason to suspect he is LE, but let&#039;s just assume for a second that he is so that I can deal with this as safely as possible.&nbsp; If he is, then he&#039;ll have gone to the phone company and got my details, and they would have flagged my address.&nbsp; So now I will either not get my package &#039;cause it&#039;s been seized or I will get a controlled drop.&nbsp; I should not be required to sign for the package, and therefore if I am required I will know it&#039;s a controlled drop and I understand that I should not sign for it and refuse the package in this case.&nbsp; If I do receive the package I understand I should write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package immediately and leave it by the front door for a few days to &quot;cool off&quot;.<br /><br />So is there any advice you guys can give me?&nbsp; Is there anything I&#039;m not doing that I should be doing to protect myself?<br /><br />If one of the best courses of action is to create a new bitcoin account, is it safe to transfer bitcoins from my old account to my new account, or can this be traced somehow?<br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance, guys.&nbsp; I appreciate any feedback or guidance you can give.<br /><br />Ultimately I&#039;m not particularly worried about this one transaction &#039;cause the amount ordered is tiny, but I&#039;d like to be more careful in the future and be more secure and more anonymous.<br /><br />Thanks.
