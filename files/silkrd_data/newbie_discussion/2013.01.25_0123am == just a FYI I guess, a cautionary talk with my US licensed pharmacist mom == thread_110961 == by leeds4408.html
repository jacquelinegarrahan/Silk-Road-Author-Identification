				perhaps this post may be more pertinent in the more accessible and general online pharmacies forums but in any case I figured it wouldn&#039;t hurt to relay my thoughts here as well (but with NO intentions to cause any unnecessary paranoia, seriously...I encounter that way too much in such forums sometimes)<br /><br />my mother who presently is pharmacist just told me that there is an unusually intense push among the working pharmacists to go through continuing education seminars geared specifically for the &quot;epidemic&quot; among adolescents in regards to substance abuse with controlled medicines (for those familiar with CE credits, please explain for me as I&#039;m too tired to hash it out in case any forum members are confused); she is generally aware of my previous purchases from overseas vendors (those pubescent days when I had no idea of SR&#039;s existence), and as a caring mother should, is slightly concerned and wonders if I continue this habit.<br /><br />in any case, back to the core of this post, my mother said the number 1 agenda apparently is oxycontin/painkillers etc abuse among adolescents (I thought it was nothing new; I am personally not a user of them, and stay away from them, but I don&#039;t say that with any judgmental context) but the number 2 agenda was the abuse that is coming from purchases made from online pharmacies. now I am very much aware that SR may be ahead in some respects in regards to that agenda, and so that is why I began this post with the disclaimer that this may be more appropriate for other forums? so yes, perhaps I should go do that..lol <br />but yeah, it was agenda 2 that compelled her to share with me this recent awareness-based initiative among the (US) pharmacist profession; I don&#039;t know how much validity there is behind her additional remark citing that there is a recent increase in various enforcement efforts to crack down on the IOPs. I take that with a slightly conflicting grain of salt only because of an insightful comment made by another SR member who truly believes such agenda is ultimately &quot;small fish&quot; for the government to invest money in. surely there are enough things that the government is more preoccupied with at the moment (gun control being one glaring example); but that said, it is perhaps at least a stark reminder of any tenured SR member that one should never be complacent about this side of the world, no matter how rosy the active community appears to be. <br /><br />but I will close on a more happy note as I&#039;m tired of being depressed from this shitty weather as of late lol, and that is I am glad to at least be part of a more intelligent community of users here at SR (or I would like to think so anyways!)<br />alas, who can so easily ignore such a well-meaning expression of genuine concern from one&#039;s own mother anyways right? and perhaps somewhat ironically, it was not the abusive potential that worried her, but rather, the sheer legal consequences (from the fact that she was relieved to hear that I had begun getting small legitimate prescriptions for tramadol from a random physician who conveniently works right down the hall from my work place, although we both acknowledged that tramadol at the moment is not controlled in our state and b. the physician doesn&#039;t freaking take my insurance, so i&#039;m literally paying out of pocket, which seems to only render the far cheaper price tags on IOP meds a bit more justified in my pragmatic point of view, but I am now rambling lol<br /><br />best regards fellow Newbies :)

				Thanks for the report. I understand agenda 1, but I feel it really isn&#039;t a concern for pharmacists, but more of the doctors filling out prescriptions. Also ever heard of pill mills? Look up on youtube drugs inc pill nation, I think it&#039;s called. I&#039;m sure you would be interested in seeing that documentary, as it does go in dept as to your mothers concerns. Sorry to hear of your insurance not covering your meds. That&#039;s a pain. I think that is why most people turn to sites like SR to fulfill there needs.

				The media coverage and subsequent general panic that ensued concerning the Oxycontin &quot;Hillbilly Heroin&quot; Epidemic, resulting in pulling OC off the market in the US certainly had an effect:<br /><br />It forced thousands of addicted teens / adults to switch to street heroin.<br /><br />How fucking nice.

				thanks for sharing.&nbsp; though to add my 2 cents and perspective, this shouldnt really alarm anybody on here.&nbsp; what pharmacists are talking about in their required CE has little to do with the reality of any LEO operations.&nbsp; its just been talked about a lot lately that Rx abuse is a big problem.&nbsp; Next year itll be diabetes again or something.

				Sometimes I wish pharmacists were more consistent, but then there&#039;s the risk they&#039;d be consistently strict and anal. So far, I&#039;ve been pretty lucky to come across mostly cool people.

				thanks for everyones 2cents thus far; varied reactions were expected but I think it is no question that one will always have to be a step ahead, or play catch up-depending on who you/how much you know I suppose, or care for that matter<br /><br />nevertheless, I only recently encountered I believe to be their most recent &quot;progress report&quot; a few days ago from the Natl boards of pharm; didn&#039;t read that one yet but perused through their Jan 2013 report and consensus seems to come down to (not so surprising) findings on counterfeit drugs with myriad online pharms. (all the more reason to stick with SR-albeit the pros and cons).<br /><br />.here is the link if anyone cares to check it out; personally I find their website to be more interesting: www.nabp.net/news/assets/IDOIReportApril11.pdf <br />**please note that this is a PDF file and therefore unable to view with proxy; in other words, do not open PDFs with your Tor browser**<br /><br />Finally, as you can tell from my previous few posts that I am an avid ny times reader, and this particular op-ed piece was memorable and controversy aside, simply well written: article is titled &quot;the last all nighter&quot;

				Most CE seminars are crap. Usually the drug companies or medical product manufacturers will put on seminars offering free continuing education credits to organizations that purchase or distribute their products. It is mostly a shell game to make the books look better and like the company is offering a better bargain for an overpriced product.<br /><br />If I buy a MRI scanner from Siemens then they will offer a rebate of $20K in education credits which can be used for onsite applications training at the cost of $2-3K a day. The applications specialist is usually a burned out MRI tech who can teach people to push buttons but can rarely answer any technical questions beyond that.<br /><br />So in this case, somebody sees something sensationalized on TV and decides to use it as a topic for a seminar. Those that run the CE seminars must plan and give X number of said seminars a year. The more participants, the more the company can write off by awarding specific category CE credits. So how do you get a pharmacist or any other licensed professional to care enough to take the time to tune in? Offer free CE&#039;s for something that is a current hot topic and offer lots of buzzwords and cite common knowledge stories.<br /><br />It is a sham to call it education as the technical information conveyed is usually little more than a cobbling together of these stories, a couple of bullshit graphs to make it look like statistical trends. This morphs into a prepackaged alternative product presentation that they conveniently offer and then about twenty minutes of discussion and about ten minutes of break time in there on a 60 minute seminar. Usually the discussion is some amped up windbag that asks and answers his own questions for the whole twenty minutes until it is over.<br /><br />Does this explain how CE credits work OP?<br /><br />Tramadol is cheap. I have the SNRI properties, nucynta is 100x worse for that. I pay cash for tramadol and feed it to my fog. He likes it, makes his hips feel better. I tried it for a while but decided I get more out of it as a veterinary pain killer. After nucynta I was pretty pissed off and asked my doc for fentanyl patches and he obliged. 50mcg/hr q 48h. It works good for the pain, sucks for making me feel good. I may go to 75mcg/hr, I don&#039;t know yet as I don&#039;t really want to go too high if there is little benefit. I think it just may make it harder for enjoyable drugs to work as well.<br /><br />The patches are very popular on SR and sell for serious coin, especially the gel patches I get. I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t get it other than the pain is mostly relieved with little to no CNS effects.

				Teen drug use is only going to increase in the next decade as online black markets such as SR vastly increase the efficiency and security of drug distribution networks. The authorities are losing the drug war badly now, and its only going to get worse. The only real question is when do they surrender?
