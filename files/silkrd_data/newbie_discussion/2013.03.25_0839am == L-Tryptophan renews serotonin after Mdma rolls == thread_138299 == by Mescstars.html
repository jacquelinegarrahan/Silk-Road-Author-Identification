				Ok, I&#039;m sure that many of you have heard this and I have found this works very effectively namely supplementing with the amino L-tryptophan after using Mdma for several days , as L-tryptophan converts into serotonin rapidly in the body. also L-Phenylalanine converts into dopamine both neurotransmitters critical for having a great roll. and both get mightily used up after Mdma use especially if its weekly or several times a month. so if you roll alot or even trip alot on other other psychs chances are you need to supplement with both serotonin and dopamine builders.&nbsp; l-tryptophan for serotonin and l-phenylalanine for dopamine,&nbsp; supplementing with these has increased the strength of my rolls on Mdma and my trips<br />on Mescaline incredibly well.&nbsp; so I invite everyone here to try this out and if you have already please leave your comments for what&#039; you think it&#039;s done for you.&nbsp; 8)<br />you can find great deals here ,buy bulk and save at Pure Bulk&quot;)<br /><br />http://www.bulksupplements.com/products-by-category/amino-acids.html

				I like L-Tryptophan, it seems to effect me better than HTP-5 does. I was taking the HTP-5 for awhile, but switched to L-Tryptophan and having much better results. In fact, I take it on a daily basis now since I have low serotonin levels to begin with.
