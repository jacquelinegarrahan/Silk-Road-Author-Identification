				your english is ok fella.<br />Go to pharmacy &amp; find cough syrup with dxm.<br />Very underrated stuff and the best for newbies, imho.<br />Not exactly a psychodelic by classification but provides clear insights and brings you to different plane of mind.

				i&#039;d go for a low dose of magic mushrooms then you can gradually increase if you like the feel of it. a little bit of weed can help with the nausea after you eat them but enjoy a clean trip for 2-4 hours then when it starts winding down smoke some awesome weed and it&#039;s magical. just find a nice relaxed setting for the trip!

I love Brazil, as I have been there once, and want to go back to travel. I tried MDMA for the first time exactly a year ago, and loved it ever since. It&#039;s an awesome experience, where you just fill up with happiness. All social-barriers are gone when on MDMA, and you just feel open to friends, strangers, the world. MDMA has the potential to make you hallucinate if you do a large amount, but typically it doesn&#039;t. You would probably be surprised how aware &amp; in control you are. I highly recommend trying some from a reputable vendor, do some research as to who fits you best. I recommend Schizofreen as he is an outstanding vendor with amazing MDMA, especially his PARTYFLOCK pills. SuperTrips has good MDMA, but I recommend waiting a few weeks to see how his new packaging/stealth is doing, as he has had some problems recently &amp; had to give me a refund. My advice if you do things in moderation like myself, always wait at least 1 month, if not more, in between MDMA use. The effects are much better if you do that, and it is less neurotoxic to your body.<br /><br />As for LSD, which I tried with a friend for the first time 9 days ago, I recommend ordering from LucyDrop in Canada. I had two hits of his LSD and it was an amazing experience, full of laughter, fun, knowledge, and some trippy visuals. It is kind of hard to describe, but it&#039;s a long trip with effects lasting 12hrs, although it isn&#039;t as strong at the end.<br /><br />There is always a chance to get caught when ordering something illegal through the mail. If I said there wasn&#039;t a chance, that would be ignorant. The vendors I listed are great and have sent me stuff flawlessly, besides SuperTrips, which is why I recommend waiting a few weeks if you do order from him, after checking the forums and reviews. He has a 100% refund/reship policy that he abides to, which is very nice. I do not know your countries legal system, but if you got caught ordering small, personal sized amounts, I don&#039;t think you would get in HUGE trouble. That is not to say that the legal consequences wouldn&#039;t be bad. Do some research on your local laws. <br /><br />Best of luck brother.

				Like others have said, your English is good, so don&#039;t be worrying. ;)<br /><br />In relation to psychedelics, i&#039;d recommend LSD and DMT. Regarding security, LSD is probably got the best chance of getting to you as it usually comes on blotter paper, which is flat. This makes it easy to send in the mail.<br /><br />My best&nbsp; trips have been on DMT, but it is hard to describe in words what happens on a DMT trip. I will tell you that it is AMAZING :)<br /><br />

				I&#039;d say give NMBOE a miss, in my experience of doing 25i, its not that great, but of course, the setting may of effected this. imo shrooms or clean LSD are the way to go. Shrooms will tend to only last 4-6 hours and a generally pretty calm.

				I used to be bang on the psychedelics. However over the years I have come to realise that your mind set and overall setting of the trip environment will dictate how good the trip will be.&nbsp; If your life is going very well you can drop any psychedelic and you will have an awesome time! ... I definitely recommend Mescaline or Shrooms out of all the trips available

You said that &quot;all social-barriers are gone&quot;, it sounds good to take in a party with some friends. I will follow your advice, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a spectacular experience. <br /><br />Thank you!

Thx for the advice, I already read a lot about it and how your current state of mind, health and ambient influences! It&#039;s going to happen next month and I already chose where it&#039;s going to be, a nice and beautiful beach here in Brazil. (How can I upload a photo?

				it&#039;s definitely easier to conceal LSD in a letter than shrooms. the trip will last quite a lot longer and feels less natural. in my experience the visuals are a lot more intense and you don&#039;t get so much of that ahh i want to hug the entire world feeling but it&#039;s an amazing trip don&#039;t get me wrong. be aware the vendors tend to lie or just don&#039;t know about the strength of their tabs. check out the avengers thread and rumor mill section for reviews. if you upload a photo wipe the metadata first so the popo don&#039;t get you!

				Personally I would go with Molly (mdma), or 2-cb<br /><br />Pure Molly is way to euphoric to have a bad trip on in my opinion, and 2-cb is a fairly light psychedelic. Just make sure you do your research before, the good things and the bad, and you&#039;ll be fine.

				I wouldn&#039;t say MDMA is exactly &#039;psychedelic&#039;, but it&#039;s what I would recommend as the next thing to try. I can&#039;t imagine having a bad time on it, as long as you&#039;re vaguely sensible with your dose (~120-150mg for a first time). <br /><br />I&#039;ve also tried 2c-b - although only once, so far - and it seems like a great introduction to psychedelic visuals - the headspace is very clear, so you&#039;re unlikely to panic. At at ~20mg dose, I only had quite light visuals, although it was still a lot of fun.<br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on the classic psychedelics like shrooms or LSD yet, although from what I&#039;ve read, low doses of either would be a good start, too. Once you&#039;re used to more altered states of mind/visuals, I&#039;d recommend 25i-NBOMe. I took half a 1200ug tab, then the other half a little later, and had very little anxiety, but a long and interesting trip - my first real one. At that dose, there is quite a lot of mindfuck - I got stuck in thought loops, for example - but the visuals are mind-blowing. A lower dose (~600ug) may be better to start with, though.

				DMT is wonderful - wonder-ful, truly ;D<br /><br />as a beginner, esp being alone, dmt can be lets say an impression. a great one, for sure, but one with impact.<br /><br />i&#039;d had considered you as well some shrooms to start with, but since the shipping to brazil the lsd might be really the better choice. just dont dose too much the first time. LucyDrop sends from the american continent, that might be good. for decent prices as well, stellar acid. for sure great for a first trip. i would considet taking a half tab bein alone.<br /><br />2cb can be a great way as well to go into hallucinogenics.. the mindset is truly different, easier: its not that deep (at all), even when having spectacular vision.<br /><br />my advice is still, and would be, try the magic of hallucinogenics, which i find especially in tryptamines, as lsd, shrooms or dmt, for the first time, since it is a sure way to taste the bliss ..... i think that can give an awesome first impression! &lt;3

				DMT!!! :D ... the best trip i&#039;ve ever had with DMT is that I used a volcano vaporizer and filled a small vaporizer bag at the maximum temperature.&nbsp; As soon as i exhaled the room i was gone! ... words can&#039;t describe what i was seeing but it was intense! after what seemed to be an eternity I teleported back into the real world, truly surreal psychedelic experience!<br /><br />DMT is highly recommended!

				i enjoy coke and xanax, also looking into opioids, but my drug of choice would be hash.<br />however if your looking for trips, 2c-b is what you want, about 25mg each trip.<br /><br />but no doubt the best psychedelics i have had, ever, was &quot;flein&quot; mushrooms from northern Norway, it is so delicious.<br />maybe i should import some and sell on SR, however the catch is that its a season drug, so limited supplies.
