				I take these speedballs I make on occasion. Freshman in college going to major in chemistry I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m a pro but I know basic procedures and have friends. I have access to 3x box 10x 100mcg/hr Actavis patches and 1x box of the 10x Watson 75mcg/hr. This is a theoretical maximum of 375mg of fentanyl obviously I don&#039;t get it all I&#039;ll have about 310mg of Fentanyl base. These are the gel reservoir patches. The fentanyl I have to buy. And no I&#039;m not hurting some poor lady and guy. They need the money to pay their bills so they are happy I buy them. I paid them more then what they wanted because I couldn&#039;t give them so little when they are struggling.<br /><br />&nbsp;I then extract Dextroamphetamine from Dexedrine and spasules. It&#039;s sickening how easy it is to get 10mg even compounded 15mg D-Amp if you are a college student with good grades and good hygiene and find the right doctor. I end up with 180 15mg spansules 100 10mg Dexedrine and 210 Dexedrine 5mg (these are from multiple people seeing doctors for me) which is a theoretical maximum of 4.75G. These are actually a lot more work but I&#039;m left with beautiful as pure as pure can can be Dextroamphetamine HCl ( it absorbs water but i make speedballl doses so don&#039;t worry) half a gram gets lost in the process. At least these are all legal scripts.<br /><br />&nbsp;So now I have 310mg of Fentanyl base&nbsp; and 4,264mg of Dextroamphetamine HCl , also a Bottle of Type 1 Laboratory water I liberated and a bunch of air tight tiny amber glass bottles (2mL capacity) Now the fentanyl is diluted down with a pipette so each drop is 500 micrograms. I get 4264mg of pure d_Amp into 42.64mL type 1 lab water then add 16 drops of fentanyl so 8mg, so that&#039;s 200mg of Dextroamphetamine and 8mg of fentanyl in 2mL vial. I use it rectally with oral syringe but it could easily be IV&#039;d into multiple doses.<br /><br />A lot of work goes into this and nothing is ever totally pure there will be microscopic impurities of god knows what but that&#039;s true of everyone&#039;s stuff. Remember its time intensive for me and time is money. Air tight glass amber vials are not free. Prescription amphetamine is not cheap neither is fentanyl. All this taken into consideration is their interest in my speedballs? I get straight A&#039;s.

				they synergize beautifully together. I may Try it with dextromethamphetamine but only with desoxyn pharma made.

				I know I&#039;ll never find those pills so it&#039;s whatever I have a feeling amphetamine is a little better in this situation anyways.

				and nope didn&#039;t mean do 200 + 8 all in 2mL. If you inject you can do easy math to figure out how much you are doing using insulin unts
