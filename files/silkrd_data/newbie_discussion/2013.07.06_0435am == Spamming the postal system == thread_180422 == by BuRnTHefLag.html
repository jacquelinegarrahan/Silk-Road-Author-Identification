				I only found SR and tor network recently and have been learning a lot really fast. Reading through the forums here and various other dark web sources it seems there is an almost overwhelming amount of valuable information to learn.&nbsp; So this is what Ive been thinking after my short time here... <br />So if your living in a smaller town where people dont really receive much international mail , I was wondering if it would be a good idea to spam your local area with a heap of junk mail while waiting for a delivery. Like say I was waiting on a package and I was to get a heap of similar looking legit mail (catalogues, info/sample packs etc) sent to lots of random houses in my neighborhood. This I assume would make the job of postal workers and LE harder to identify the package with the goodies.<br />Would this work or a complete waist of time?<br /><br />Sorry for the long 1st post but I figure it was better to ask a question than spam my way to 50

				How do you arrange to have junk mail sent to other people in your town? It seems sort of unnecessary and like it wouldn&#039;t really target the risk your taking. I think there&#039;s a much higher possibility of your order being seized in customs than your post man reporting it or something. In fact I think you&#039;d be best off leaving everything as normal as possible so that the post man doesn&#039;t notice anything out of the ordinary. You should also try to receive small packages regularly to whatever address you want to use so that it never looks weird when you get a package.

				Those addresses have nothing to do with SR - they&#039;re old &amp; pulled from other sites. Just flag the account &amp; don&#039;t worry about it. <br /><br />To the OP: Just don&#039;t order internationally. If your town is that small it just seems too risky.
