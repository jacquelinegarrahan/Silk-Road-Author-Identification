				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Tonight I made a Bitinstant purchase to sr bitcoin address<br /><br />The amount i payed in cash was $343.95&nbsp; when it finally<br />showed up in my sr account in&nbsp; the amount 2.66406386 bc<br />or $232.26<br /><br />I am missing over $100 from the transfer. Bitinstant had the<br />trasfer listed to my address as 343.95. Anyone have a&nbsp; similar<br />problem?<br /><br />Thanks

				A few other users have reported having this same issue.&nbsp; I wonder - are you receiving the correct amount of btc but it&#039;s just displaying the USD equivalent incorrectly, or are there actual btc missing?

				Me too. I paid $163 and the coins I got had a value of $143, i assumed it was the market flux. but now that you mention it my coins should have been less than expected not the dollar amount. I was suppose to get 0.9btc but only got 0.64 worth $143 it said. Did they short change us? it was my first time buying btc so....

				BTC was going for around 125 earlier so 2.66 x 125 = $332.5<br />The current Silk Road value (the MtGox Weighted Avg) is 87.71 so 2.66 x 87.71 = $233.30<br />There&#039;s the difference.<br /><br />You should wait for the Weighted Average to update. BTC has been steady about 110 so the SR average will jump up to around that in 12 hours and you&#039;ll have closer to $293<br /><br />
