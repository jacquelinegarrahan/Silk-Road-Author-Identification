				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Whats the appropriate time for waiting for your order to go from processing to shipped? Been 5 days? Getting pissed as i had to do a whole lot off running around to get it in so it would arrive early and now there&#039;s no chance it will arrive in time? Am i warranted to be pissed???&nbsp; :-\

				I think processing should NOT take more than 3days!!! So if you ordered on Monday, it NEEDS to be shipped by the latest Wednesday, NO EXCEPTIONS, unless the vendor states prior to the order that he/she is backed up and it could take longer than usual. If it&#039;s USA TO USA the entire process with the 1-3 days processing should not take more than 10DAYS the most!!! If it takes more than 10days i&#039;m done doing business with that vendor and unless he stated prior to my order that he backed-up or other issues have arise. That vendor WILL get a bad review from me. Vendors need to realize that as much as they have a business to run, there are buyers out there with their OWN business to run as well and late arrivals effect is enormously!!

				Well, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever personally waited 5 days for an item to go from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit,&quot; but it all depends on availability of the item, popularity of the vendor, and shipping times.<br />Maybe check their page again to see if they only ship on certain days? Definitely shoot them a message and ask what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />Sorry, that sucks.

				All of my orders have been processed within 24 hours, no problem. Many are shipped same day or next day. <br /><br />I&#039;d say after 48 hours I&#039;d message the vendor unless otherwise stated - as mentioned above.

				WOW! I thought my head was going to explode! I know waiting for packages is annoying enough but then going on the road everyday to notice its still being processed!! well that&#039;s just depressing!!<br /><br />Every other order Ive had has been max 1 day. I waited for 2 weeks for him to come back to stock then the day he did i ran all over town acquiring bitcoins only to have int sit in processing for 5 days WTF? Ive messaged him a few times just discussing the order its self making chit chat so he knows the orders there but still nothing just tells me there flat out, and i don&#039;t want to sound to pushy in case he cancels me as hes the only vendor that offers full escrow for orders to my shitty country!!! Anyway to say HURRY THE F**K UP! In a pleasant non aggressive manor?&nbsp; &nbsp;???

				its in the vendor guide not to mark shipped if its not<br />&nbsp;Things to avoid<br /><br />Below is a short list of specific things you should avoid. It is by no means exhaustive, but taking any one of these actions could get your seller priviledges revoked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Directing customers to pay outside the escrow system or in currencies other than Bitcoin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving fake feedback for yourself from a dummy buyer account<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Saving customer addresses<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Claiming to have sent an order when you haven&#039;t<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Threatening customers

				5 days seems a bit long. But you could always cancel your order at that point if you are tired of waiting.<br />I&#039;ve found&nbsp; that most of the quality vendors will ship within 24-48 hours.<br />However, it seems like some of the larger vendors can get swamped sometimes. <br />Then again, maybe we are getting spoiled by the fact that we are able to have drugs delivered to our front door.&nbsp; ;D
