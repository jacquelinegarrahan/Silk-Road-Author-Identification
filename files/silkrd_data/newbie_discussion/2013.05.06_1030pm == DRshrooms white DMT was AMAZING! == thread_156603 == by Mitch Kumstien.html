				I took my first journey and I used DRshrooms white DMT to do so and I must say WOW! I had 100 mg to work with and it was my first time so I packed the pipe using the sandwich method by packing the DMT in between to nice nugs of some purple cheese and I didn&#039;t do it entirely right because I didn&#039;t break through, I barely felt anything. So now with determination I pack the remainder of the DMT, but this time I laid down a small bed of bud and placed the DMT on top. Then with my lighter I took small pulls that resulted in the freebase melting onto the bud, but WITHOUT BURNING IT. I took two rips and as I felt myself drifting away I could hear Terence McKenna saying to hit it again before you can&#039;t anymore because that&#039;s how to experience a real break-through, so I did, and then, WOW!!!!!!!!!!! If I wasn&#039;t there it would be nearly unbelievable, and I&#039;ll leave any description of the actual trip out because they would do it no justice. Remind yourself not to be scared because it can be intimidating, especially if doing it alone for my first time at that, or as in my case I did it with only the company of my loyal and trusted dog. I just thought I&#039;d share what worked for me.<br /><br />What I will say is this, if you are looking for an unmatchable psychadelic experience then go and try some DMT, IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT, and if you want a HIGH QUALITY product then DRshrooms is it!<br /><br />Journey well and be safe...

				It was amazing. The feeling that I am left with is this- that all the suffering, all the loss in ones own life is all worth the price of admission, so to speak, if where we end up is in this &quot;hyperspace.&quot; It was beautiful. The point where I felt my hand dissolving, and the boundary of what is my hand and the surrounding space where no longer separate but rather a single construct. I mean I can talk about the trip for hours because just describing what I felt happening to my hand which only occurred momentarily, on and off again throughout the trip, was such a small portion of the entire journey. <br />There was/is so much more to describe and work out for myself before I can clearly share it with others, but I figure placing another order from DRshrooms and taking another journey in the near future will help clarify some things, but then again I don&#039;t know because this is my first time... I figure it can&#039;t hurt... ;D<br />My advice is the same as Terence McKenna&#039;s and the countless others that advise you to smoke until you can no longer perceptually control your motor functions, and once this occurs, once you can no longer hold the pipe let that be the measure of when you have had enough, then put the pipe down, sit back and remind yourself it is only temporary, then ENJOY. ;)
