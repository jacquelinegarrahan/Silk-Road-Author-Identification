				Hi,<br />First, I&#039;m sure this has been asked and answered many times here but I haven&#039;t been able to find a conclusive answer through my my own research, and hey, you can never be too careful.<br />So story is, trying not to divulge too much personal info, for personal reasons i&#039;ve had to move back into my parents house and I&#039;m not comfortable having stuff (mainly cannabis) shipped there. <br />So the next option I was considering is renting a post box, however I have some concerns. My understanding is the main risk with this is that you don&#039;t have the safety of denying ownership of the package once you pick it up, is this correct (in Ireland)? Also it appears using a fake name wouldn&#039;t be an option as you&#039;re required to show ID when you sign up to rent the mail box. I wouldn&#039;t be too worried except that I occasionally get largeish orders and would be pretty fucked if caught with one. <br />If there&#039;s anyone out there who could help a dude out with some advice/info it would be immensely appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks

				I use a PO box. I&#039;ve been researching on how they would do a controlled delivery at a post office. Basically, if your package does get intercepted, they&#039;ll usually put a note in your PO box asking to pick up your package at the front desk, which does require a signature. If this happens, disregard your package, it&#039;s lost. Whatever you do, don&#039;t sign anything and don&#039;t open your package until you&#039;re in a safe place.

				Thanks for responding.. I went into one of the few places renting post boxes today and they were quite small, so I asked about larger packages ( some shipment&#039;s I&#039;ve received previously would def not fit), I was told, as you said, they would put a note in the box and to collect at the desk.. This would create something of a dilemma.. However I&#039;ve had nearly 30 orders arrive successfully to my previous address and have every faith in the stealth my vendors use and as it appears this is only real option outside of renting a place just for SR mail, which I&#039;m not keen on. Do you mind me asking what country you&#039;re in? As I&#039;m in Ireland almost all of my orders are international so are subject to inspection by customs.. Would be so much easier if I lived in the states, domestic shipping is where it&#039;s at

				I&#039;m not an expert, and only human. So don&#039;t blindly trust me :)<br />My 2 cents:<br /><br />1. I&#039;ve read several times that packages or big fat letters sent from a foreign country to a p.o. box raise a red flag. So it&#039;s actually riskier than sending it to a normal private street adress.<br />Just read those threads about mail security in the security forum.<br /><br />2. If BIG orders are your problem, there&#039;s an obvious solution: several smaller shipments. I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t need to smoke 500g of weed all at the same day, do you?<br />So how about 1-2 small letters per week instead of 1 fat package every other month?<br /><br />3. Maybe you know someone you can totally trust, and who is not involved in any illegal stuff (especially drugs), that lets you use his adress?<br /><br />4. Maybe there is an abandoned (but not totally wrecked) house near you? Read: dead mailbox. Put a name on the doorbell and mailbox, and have it sent there, secretly pick up the mail at night etc. Details: security forum + google.<br /><br />5. As you seem to either smoke a lot or sell a lot, have you ever looked into growing yourself? It&#039;s MUCH easier than you probably think. And for a small growbox/-tent the ROI would be reached after about 2 harvests. Hell, if you wouldn&#039;t need much, you could even grow in a PC bigtower (youtube -&gt; pc grow) right under the noses of your parents if you filter the exhaust properly ;-) Also, growing can be a very nice rewarding hobby and fun! I now understand why some people love gardening. Sitting right next to my plants on the balcony, seeing them, watching them grow fatter, touching them and smelling them is awesome! Not sure how much sunlight an irish summer provides. In germany it&#039;s hardly enough to grow automatic strains, but it works somewhat (=you get typical outdoor weed of medium potency and not the highest yield).<br /><br />5.b Maybe you could persuade someone else to start growing? Or he/she provides only the location while you take care of the plants every 2-3 days?<br /><br />6. How hard/possible would it be for you to actually find a local dealer/friendofafriendofafriend to get rid of the mail problem?<br /><br />7. Ever thought of buying hash, skuff, oil, budder, honey, extracts etc. instead of weed? Packages would be a LOT smaller.<br /><br />8. Have it shipped to your workplace&nbsp; :D *jk*<br /><br /><br />Also, to help you better: what exactly is your fear regarding shipments to your parents? That your parents find out you&#039;re a stoner? That your parents get in trouble with the police? That you get in trouble with the police? Anything else? Do you know a fellow stoner IRL? Maybe he could receive the packages?

				Hey dude,<br /><br />How far are you from the border with the north? If you&#039;re within a reasonable distance when factoring in fuel/travel costs it may be worth a look.<br /><br />My friend has a flooring business and he uses a PO Box for legitimate work purposes and weed. Not a single problem in 3 years.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how tight customs are in the Republic with incoming post from the UK but at least up north there are no such problems if getting weed from a UK vendor seeing as there are no customs.<br /><br />Just a thought....

				Maybe could&nbsp; try to get the mailbox using a fake id ?<br /><br />I&#039;m from Ireland too and like you i love my thc. Can you recommend (by pm) sellers who sell reasonably priced gear that is packaged well and consistently makes delivery ?

Maybe he could receive the packages?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for such a thorough response mate, I&#039;ll try and respond to each of your suggestions/ questions.<br />1. Most of packages would be coming from the US, I decided I&#039;m better off avoiding ordering from any countries that might be&nbsp; a bit suspicious, i.e. mexico/ holland/ thailand/ Colombia etc. I mainly stick to Domestic (Ireland), the UK and USA/ Cananda. I can&#039;t imagine orders from those countries would really cause a much suspicion, I order legal products online from those countries all the time and have family in all of them, as do many in Ireland.<br /><br />2. Most of the weed I buy is for reselling so I do need to order in bulk, and while I see your point about smaller packages I feel like it&#039;s safer keeping illicit goods traffic to a minimum so I&#039;m more comfortable getting 2/3 larger orders a month then 5/6 smaller ones. Also, the vendors I traditionally use have excellent stealth and I have every confidence they will get through.<br /><br />3. I did this at the start, gave my buddy cash to let me ship to his place. But he&#039;s not into any drugs really and the concept of the silk road seems outrageous to him so once bulk orders started arriving he got sketched out and wanted out. Personally, I would not rather put my friends in that position.<br /><br />4. I thought about this as Ireland has been wracked by recession there are countless derelict houses, I just feel like it would be playing with fire. If I was a postie and suddenly started getting packages addressed to abandoned houses I would be very suspicious. Maybe if if I found the right place but just seems like a very risky option.<br /><br />5. I grew before and will likely again once I get my own place ( and have my freedom returned) but it&#039;s just so much more profitable sourcing from SR. Ideally down the line I&#039;ll be supplementing my own harvests with SR product. Once my customers have tasted some the dank cali bud I&#039;ve got through here they are more than willing to pay top price for it and I cant grow comparable product yet. But your right, nothing quite like growing your own, just not an option at the moment.<br /><br />6. This would be an ideal alternative but it&#039;s hard to find a good bulk source in Ireland, especially if your looking to resell and for top quality. If I find one I&#039;ll be on it like a car bonnet.<br /><br />7.I&#039;ve thought of it, and personally am a big fan of concentrates but there just doesnt seem to be much of a market here.. I make amazingly potent and delicious brownies but always struggle to sell, people in Ireland seem to be interested in nothing but bud and hash, which is a shame.<br /><br />8. And I work in an Airport so that is definitely not possible haha<br /><br />This issue with my parents isn&#039;t them knowing im a stoner (they already do, and don&#039;t approve), it&#039;s that they aren&#039;t very trusting and in turn I don&#039;t trust them to leave my mail alone.. and if they opened a bulk order, shit would hit the fan big time.. Not that they would report me, it would just be a big ordeal I would obviously rather avoid. <br />This is only a temporary situation, in another month or two i&#039;&#039;ll hopefully have moved back out and can ship to place. For this reason I feel like should be ok using a P.O. box as I would only need it to receive 3/4 orders and I wouldn&#039;t imagine that would raise too much suspicion. But thanks for the feedback, helped a lot.. I&#039;d give you all karma if I could

				If its only for a month or 2 why not just dig deep in your pocket and give it a break untill you get your own place. only order small items for yourself. after all is all this worry and hassle really worth it for a short period. plus the risk of getting caught sending it to PO box number seems to be a bit greater aswell. just a suggestion

It would be a lot easier for sure if I could do that but it would be at least 3 hours drive each way, not worth it really. If I was in Dublin or somewhere closer I would definitely look into this option. Anyway I&#039;ve had a good few orders from the UK and all made it.. Would be the absolute bees knees if a Irish vendor would open up offering bulk.

Plus I would be ordering a good few legal products online from amazon ebay etc which wouldn&#039;t hurt I reckon.. Plus I can sign up for some junk mail, newsletter to increase traffic. Also there are vendors here who can send dummy packages which I would probably use also.. Unless anyone else has any further info I think I&#039;m gonna chance it. I&#039;m prepared to deal with it if shit goes down
