				25i-NBOMe. It sounded the closest RC to LSD so thought I&#039;d give it a try. Only have done 2C-B and 2C-I as far as RC psychedelics and wouldn&#039;t have looked for this one but after coming across it on here decided to spend some left over bitcoin on it. I wasn&#039;t impressed - it seemed like too much mind-fuck for the amount of visual effects. Looking forward to getting some real LSD and some mushrooms to do with the wife.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered some Ketamine. I&#039;ve never have had it, just never quite got my hands on that one. Came close a couple of times but never went through. Looking forward to that one.

				i could get most stuff on the street but some things the quality is really poor and the stuff on SR that i tried was much better<br />BTH and meth is not common where i live. you can get it but its total bunk. some of the BTH ive gotten on SR blew away the powder i got on the streets<br />i also got some meth for some friends. i grabbed meth a couple times on the street years ago and it was real dirty color and like a powdered crystal dirt lol the stuff i got on SR was BIG clear crystal glass shards. it was for friends and they didn&#039;t sleep for 3 days off a small bag so i&#039;m assuming it was good lol<br /><br />if i was younger i would probably try all those exotic hallucinogens but i&#039;m too old for that shit now lol

				I have access to most if not all the drugs on SR. However the quality is out of the water. On the silk road 95% of the time you get exactly what you pay for and that isn&#039;t always the case on the street.

				Heroin.. I have never seen it IRL. had a chance to get a tiny bit to try once... Snorted an 1/8th of a g in a few small lines. Was pretty impressed with the quality. Ended up mixing some blow with it and had a wonderful evening :)

				Don&#039;t judge... I stumbled across SR trying to find ways to buy oxy and soma online. I just stopped breastfeeding my daughter a few weeks ago, stumbled upon SR and my husband and I decided when he gets paid to order some XTC &amp; 10mg of speed when we have our belated honeymoon in a few weeks. We&#039;ve done both in the past, never together and I&#039;m kinda excited to try since I&#039;m past all of my partying days and shit and now I&#039;m just a lonely mom haha

				^ With K, it hurts. The drip is really bad with K too, and it can leak down into your stomach and make you nauseous.<br />You have to do a lot of K to get to a K-hole. MXE is easier, feels better and gives a greater euphoria with a deeper hole. You also have to do a lot less.<br /><br />As for what I&#039;ve done cuz of SR:<br />MXE: Instantly addicted. My first real drug was DXM so I loved dissociatives already.. but MXE was so good. So much deeper. Mixes incredibly well with a psychedelic to &#039;flavour&#039; the trip.<br />n,n-DMT: Wasn&#039;t mentally ready for it. Made me suicidal until it wore off.<br />2C-E: Had a bad night, fought with my mother, gf, don&#039;t remember much about the drug.<br />25C-NBOME: Took it irresponsibly, had a bad trip in public on about 1800ug. Also, did some crazy shit on it. There was a KFC down the road I used to always buy a Zinger burger off when I was fucked up on NBOMEs. I actually went in there once with a Guy Fawkes mask in the middle of the day and purchased a zinger, they asked me what I was on and I&#039;m like Bombs from the internet and walked off. I must have looked fuckin blasted to them haha. I never went back, I&#039;m so glad I skipped town!<br />25i-NBOME: Took it responsibly, 1200ug but realized I didn&#039;t like phenethylamines at all. I feel insane on them, like I&#039;m losing control of everything and the world is crumbling. It lasts way too long for my taste and I couldn&#039;t sleep.<br />5-MEO-MIPT: Interesting, I&#039;m on it now, in the first hour after taking the capsule I thought the vendor had sent me MDMA by mistake. Then the spirals came. I think I&#039;m peaking now because I can see the carpet&#039;s pattern pulsing. It&#039;s quite mellow and I think I would even be able to sleep on it. It&#039;s a comfortable psychedelic, I don&#039;t feel the same on NBOME.<br />Ketamine: nauseating, holes aren&#039;t that deep, feeling of being &#039;fucked up&#039; rather than &#039;im having a profound experience&#039;. I like it when I&#039;m feeling depressed because it&#039;s like alcohol in a way, you forget about your problems and escape into it&#039;s comfort. But it&#039;s not a good drug for having experiences with.
