				Hey guys, I am so desperate now. I placed 2 orders on 21st of June. One from the Czech Republic(0.5 g MDMA) and another from the Netherlands(2 pre-rolled joints) I&#039;m located in Central Europe, with normal customs whatsoever they aren&#039;t that strict. But neither of them arrived yet... It&#039;s been 7 working days now. Should I be worried? Cause I&#039;m, very much so. EU to EU shipments usually arrive in 2-3 days, maximum 5. Will they arrive? Any of you ever had shipment come this late? Both sellers have 98-99% feedbacks with supposedly great stealth.<br /><br />It&#039;s 5pm in my country now, and I&#039;m like sitting on the porch looking at the mailbox, waiting for the postman who usually comes at 3 or 4. <br />Reassure me or something please!!

And yeah, my previous orders inside EU arrived in 2-5 days.<br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on! If it&#039;s the customs, how could they inspect a stealthy, professional looking and completely flat business envelope(hence the half gram molly)&nbsp; :-\

				Okay, the NL order just arrived! ;D Vendor LightningBud was really nice, and quick with the reply. He told me there was a postal strike in the NL, so that could be the reason for late shipments. Stuff was in 3 layer packaging, no smell for me. Great vendor, I recommend him!
