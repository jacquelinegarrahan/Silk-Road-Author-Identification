				Hey folks be careful what you write in the reviews and feedback&#039;s because there is a black list that vendors add to that is in the vendors forum and it is not accessible for buyers.<br /><br />This means that it is important to give a worthy review of your goods and services you get from vendors. A vendor here has to work really hard and it&#039;s like a slap in the face to get something and not let other buyers know about your experience. Be sure to finalize as soon as possible as well. If you buy something and it comes to you like it was described by the vendors page and it came in the time frame specified by the vendor then that&#039;s an automatic 5/5 regardless of quality.&nbsp; You are expected to tell about the quality with your words. Of course quality is important but unless it turns out to be a complete piece of garbage that only has the look of your product then 5/5 is expected. An item of low quality or fake all together can be talked about in their forum review thread. There&#039;s not many cases where a vendor sends complete garbage or a total fake item.<br /><br />Remember the vendors talk among them selves in their own thread. They discuss things like buyers that don&#039;t do right. They conspire also but I am trying to stay off that black list so please vendors don&#039;t be mad at me.<br /><br />Please post any info you may have about this anyone. Thanks

				I know that it sucks to have to have 50 post b4 u can say anything in other threads vut it&#039;s not worth just writing meaningless 1 or 2 letter post just to hurry it up. There are vendors who need reviews for their products and services and they want well defined buyers who post sensible helpfull information. <br /><br />When a vendor gives out 5 or so samples in exchange for a review so that other buyers may pull the trigger on his products, well that vendor will click on your username and look at what kind of stuff you have been writing. It is also discussed in the vendor&#039;s forum where they can talk about buyers with the buyers having no chance to tell their side of the story. <br /><br />So if you were a new vendor and needed reviews so you could sell more products then what kind of&nbsp; people would you look for to write a worthy review so other buyers would be confident enough to buy your products? <br /><br />It&#039;s the same when you buy something. Write a proper review and feedback. The vendor has earned it

				Is it fair to be blacklisted for telling the truth is the question? Because I received some bad shit from a &quot;reputable&quot; vendor. I gave the overall review a 4/5 because of the bad product and based the 4 off of everything else (customer service, stealth, speed). I couldn&#039;t resell the stuff even trying to at a considerable loss. After leaving the 4/5 review, said vendor threatened me with negative remarks in the above mentioned vendor forum. I personally didn&#039;t give a rat&#039;s ass about them reviewing me negatively because it is all about the bottom line, but we are in the midst of them attempting to correct the situation. But...

				Just give an honest review and keep in mind how much hard work it is to be a great vendor here when rating. If you are not going to give 5/5 you had better have a good reason and a vendor who did not work with you to resolve your issue before you posted that rating. The rating system here has too much impact on a vendor for the guys who bitch about this or that little thing. When it comes to the quality of product often it&#039;s soooo subjective and you see vendors get 4/5 because &quot;buds were not trimmed to my liking&quot;. Say it in the review comments but don&#039;t drop the point. This said, don&#039;t be afraid to say you are truly disappointed in your total experience.<br /><br />Free samples reviewers- take with a grain of salt. Most of the guys who beg for samples would lick your balls if you gave them a dollar. I think they have absolutely no merit and should be treated like Billy May endorsing Oxy-Clean.
