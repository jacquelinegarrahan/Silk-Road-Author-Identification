				Does anyone know of a person/identity with great credit that can co-sign for a new home mortgage.&nbsp; I make the money, but have a credit issue due to a crazy amount of hospital bills. I will pay them a fee and we can have a quit claim deed done shortly after the loan has closed.&nbsp; Or if anyone knows of private mortgage/hard money lenders, any referrals would be so much appreciated. Thank you!

				I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s not the place, however I am fishing for contacts anywhere that I can. I put my young family in a hard financial situation when I contracted two types of cancer and ended up in the hospital for eight consecutive months.&nbsp; As dumb as I may sound, I sit here in tears trying to find some way to give my family what they need.&nbsp; There may be a one in a billion chance that a hard money lender would read my post and reply, but one in a billion is better than nothing right now.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				craigslist_gumtree Thanks for your suggestions.&nbsp; We make plenty of money here, we just have credit issues due to tons of medical collections.&nbsp; It is important for our kids to stay in the same school district that we&#039;re in and rentals in this area are slim to none.&nbsp; We live well outside of the city now and love our area, we&#039;re just packed to the brim in our current house, but we may have to make it work. I appreciate your suggestions!
