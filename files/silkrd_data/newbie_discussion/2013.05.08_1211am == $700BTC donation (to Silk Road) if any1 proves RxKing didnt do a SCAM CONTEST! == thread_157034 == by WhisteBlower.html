				Me and a vendor here are offering to donate $700 to Silk Road or the Moderators if ANYONE comes forward to prove that Scamming Rxking DIDNT pull a fake contest for drugs and BTC and made good on his word.<br /><br />Read about it here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156411.0<br /><br />If you or ANYONE you know actually was contacted by this lying chink about &quot;winning&quot; anything (as his final lie stated he would be contacting the winners top secretly) come forward with proof. You can come forward anonymously. All you have to do is send a private message to me saying &quot;yes, Rxking contacted me and said I was a winner and this is my prize&quot;. Thats ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. And IF that happens, we will immediately give $700 in BTC as a donation to SILK ROAD. Who wouldnt want a donation to Silk Road to occur?<br /><br />If NOBODY comes forward (nobody has so far. And people who were contacted who were bending over backwards to defend RxKing are strangely silent), then it will forever be known that RxKing conducted a SCAM CONTEST and should NOT BE TRUSTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.<br /><br />
