				I am very sorry that happened to you. We all have to take the risk here.<br /><br />And avoid phishing sites. Do never reveal your PIN to anybody. : )

				Thanks guys for the replies, I haven&#039;t been able to figure out how this was done, and unfortunately that was all the money I can spare for this month at least... <br />Best of luck to you all and I hope it goes smoothly for you all buying or selling :D

So you either inserted it in some phishing site (or similar thing) or you have a keylogger into your PC (in this second case changing PIN will do nothing, the keylogger will simply record the new PIN away) without knowing it.<br /><br />I suggest you to scan your PC well if you are sure you didn&#039;t use a phishing site or gave away the PIN in some other way.<br /><br />If you use Windows it is always best to use a VM dedicated to ToR and SR and used for nothing else, and even better (much) if it is a Whonix linked VM (there&#039;s a tutorial very easy to follow about this in the security section). Alternatively be sure to have a good anti-virus/firewall (please not the windows one, a good one free is ZoneAlarm) and malware blocker/finder (plus naturally an encrypted partition/content in which you use ToR).
