				I recently dropped some acid with my neighbor. We took three hits each. Every thing was rainbows and sunshine up until about 4 and a half hours into the trip. I was having an amazing time until all of a sudden the mood shifted suddenly. <br /><br />I noticed my friend staring at me in a strange way. He wouldn&#039;t do it for long but I kept noticing him looking at. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere he attacks me and starts punching me. I managed to fight him off me and as soon as I had he would start talking to me friendly completely oblivious he had attacked me. I shook it off at first and decided to try to change the mood to a more positive one by playing some relaxing music and turning some more lights on. But as I kept trying to talk to him and keep him relaxed it became increasingly harder to get his attention. Then he attacked me again. At this point I became worried for my safety and while he was distracted I grabbed my stuff and left.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know now that I should have stayed tried harder to help him but I was still in the peak of my trip and I couldn&#039;t handle a situation like that in my condition. He ended up completely trashing his apartment, getting gashes and bruises all over his body, and opening and spilling on the floor pretty much every last bit of food in his house. <br /><br />&nbsp;I feel terrible for bailing on him but I was pretty sure I couldn&#039;t physically subdue him myself. Is there any thing else I could have done? Am I a terrible person for bailing?

				Nah you&#039;re not a bad person, at least you didn&#039;t like call the cops.&nbsp; Imo subduing someone tripping can be a slippery slope, if you can even manage to overpower their retard like strength. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had to do this with LSD, but I have with shrooms... SSRI&#039;s like Wellbutrin will end the trip.&nbsp; Well obviously it depends on the amount, but it can help you get that person to a stable condition to where they are no longer a danger to themselves.&nbsp; That is, if you can get them to eat the pills.&nbsp; That and some SSRI&#039;s work better than others I guess, so do some research.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seen many a bad trip myself, even worse than what you just went through (not to be in a pissing contest)... so I find it never hurts to keep some SSRI&#039;s handy.
