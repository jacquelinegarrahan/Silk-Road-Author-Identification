				I am a newb, getting ready for first bud buy, personal quan. Transferred BTC from my registered/verified Mt Gx acnt to a recently created Blockchain wallet. I had sent 1 other trans from my personal bitcoin-qt wallet, (possibly not being logged into VPN) to this Blockchain wallet. Sent BTC to initial SR address and a new one (both from the same blockchain wallet address), after resetting SR PW.<br /><br />Was doing some exploring on SR site, checking offers / vendors, considering shipping options (locations) - never ordered. However, I did order a few things from regular ecom sites. Tracking info showed the driver left it at front door on Thursday afternoon - I was not home when &quot;delivered&quot; and had forgotten about the order until Sat morning. I share the address (single family home) with efficiency residents and they didn&#039;t see the package either. This is the first time I&#039;ve had any difficulty with any delivery here in 5 years; also, I did receive another package via USPS on Friday(no issues). Reported missing package to vendor and UPS. Sunday morning, I find the box outside my door and piece of regular mail addressed to me in the mailbox (not there on Sat either). Even more interesting, the box had been opened from one side; however, the contents were intact and the containers were sealed. <br /><br />Any ideas? <br /><br />Any and all feedback, questions n/or tips would really be appreciated<br /><br />Thanks,<br />WdSnk<br />btw, I do use a VPN and Tor but it&#039;s soooo slow, should I just use Tor or is it better to run both?<br />
