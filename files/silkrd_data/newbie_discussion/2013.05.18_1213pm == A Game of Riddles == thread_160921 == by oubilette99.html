				A good guess but no. Here is the answer. Nobody was rescued from the building because the building was never evacuated. Only the people inside the building were evacuated. To &quot;evacuate&quot; a person is to remove the contents of their bowels. Hence poop. This is a play on words. It makes you believe that the building was &quot;evacuated&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Three guests check into a hotel room. The clerk says the bill is $30, so each guest pays $10. Later the clerk realizes the bill should only be $25. To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 to return to the guests. On the way to the room, the bellhop realizes that he cannot divide the money equally. As the guests didn&#039;t know the total of the revised bill, the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 and keep $2 for himself. Each guest got $1 back: so now each guest only paid $9; bringing the total paid to $27. The bellhop has $2. And $27 + $2 = $29 so, if the guests originally handed over $30, what happened to the remaining $1?

Limbo contains 2 doors, the man knows that one leads to heaven and one leads to hell but he doesn&#039;t know which one is which. In front of each door is a parrot, again the man knows that one ALWAYS lies and the other ALWAYS tells the truth but again doesn&#039;t know which one is which. The parrots know which door leads where and the man is told that he can ask each parrot one question but it must be the SAME question to both. What question could the man ask to find the door to heaven?
