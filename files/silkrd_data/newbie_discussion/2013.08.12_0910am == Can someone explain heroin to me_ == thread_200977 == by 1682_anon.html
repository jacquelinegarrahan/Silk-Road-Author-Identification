				I had to help bury a friend of mine who overdosed on heroin. It was really fucked up! His parents were completely devastated. So I had to help them plan the funeral. I was a pallbearer. So I helped lay his coffin into the grave. It was a horrible experience. My friend was once a great guy until he tried heroin. He just could not break that addiction. You may not give a shit about what I am saying and I don&#039;t care. I&#039;m saying funerals suck and heroin is some horrible shit!

				I believe #3 you need to acidify with citric acid or something similar.&nbsp; I would not use lime juice haha.&nbsp; Black Tar heroin is from mexico and is actually my favorite.&nbsp; I think there tend to be intermediary opioids in it and it is still usually 30% heroin.&nbsp; I have also heard that black tar contain 6MAM within the tar.&nbsp; To me tar gives you that more dynamic opioid high.

To convert #3 heroin into injectable heroin it needs to be converted to a salt through reaction with an acid. It&#039;s risky using citric fruit juice as it may contain candidal fungus which destroys the eyes and can damage the heart. As Willy said, best to use sterile citric acid.

				If you haven&#039;t done it before, leave it alone. <br /><br />But Basically #3 and #4 refer to steps in the refining process. <br /><br />#1 I believe is filtered refined opium paste<br /><br />#2 Is morphine base<br /><br />#3 Is acetylated morphine base (crude heroin)<br /><br />#4 Is purified acetylated morphine salt.<br /><br />Basically you can use(inject) heroin #3 but you have to turn it into heroin citrate with citric acid first, or you can just smoke it as is.<br /><br />#4 heroin can be dissolved in water, smoked, snorted, you can even put it in your bum for a good time&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />Black tar heroin I&#039;m not entirely sure what exactly makes it the way it is but I believe its just like not completely refined, filtered, purified #4. Its how they do it in mexico. I&#039;ve had some very amazing tar before and it has a unique rush that I fucking love but you don&#039;t want to miss a vein or your gonna have a bad time lol.<br /><br />Peace.

				As far as what the high is like, it&#039;s a strong opiate. Have you ver done any strong prescription pain killers? Specifically, ever done oxys? The real deal oldschool &quot;OC&quot; oxy&#039;s? H is similar to the high of the good, now unavailable in America , old timey oxy&#039;s . Much more potent if it&#039;s good stuff and cheaper as well. I&#039;d suggest trying to score some good oxy&#039;s, (thew good ones can still be found here), or , more easily available are the Roxi 30 IR&#039;s, (Instant Release) , these are very similar to the old oxy&#039;s . If never done B4, i would suggest not doing any of them , thats all &#039;ll say bout that part. I personally love dabbling in the opiates , but , although right now I just dabble , I have at a time in my life been strung out pretty hard and it&#039;s not somewhere you want to be .

That fundamental freedom is why we&#039;re all here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I recently read a book called &#039;Too High, Too Far, Too Soon&#039; by a guy called Simon Mason. It&#039;s the memoirs of a recovering heroin addict, although it has been aggressively marketed on the basis of a few chapters where he claims to have been the drug dealer of choice for a well-known British band in the mid-90s. <br /><br />Whilst far from the best book I&#039;ll read this year, or even the best publication I read that week, what it did do (in conjunction with some of Russell Brand&#039;s writing on the subject) was give me a graphic description of heroin&#039;s effects (both pharmacologically and socially) and the mechanism of dependence. <br /><br />It seems Hitch is one of the lucky ones, who can &#039;take it or leave it&#039;. Enjoy it for what it is and then just get on with his life. The description of the &#039;little voice in your head&#039; which it addiction, the compulsion to feel as good as you feel when high ALL THE TIME is something I can relate to to some small degree. I smoked too much cannabis at university and it inarguably affected my social life and my motivation. Rather than reward myself with a smoke I&#039;d get up and get baked, rationalising that it would make me &#039;creative&#039; - which was sometimes the case but more often not. <br /><br />Similarly when I discovered MDMA (and no, I&#039;m not about to go off on some idiotic suggestion that MDMA is addictive) I FUCKING LOVED IT. I wanted that feeling all the time. So for a period of about six months I was getting on it on average once a week - sometimes less often, many times more often. It took my first serious comedown to make me realise how much that drug needs to be respected. Also, dropping a defqon and feeling barely anything whilst my friend could hardly walk make me stop and consider my tolerance. <br /><br />Willpower. That&#039;s what it comes down to. I was obese as a teen because I simply didn&#039;t have the power to not eat all the shit I knew I shouldn&#039;t eat. It was only once the desire to not be so fat overwhelmed the desire to eat that I was able to become a healthy, &#039;normal&#039; (ish) adult. In my late 20s I finally got there with weed and MDMA. Knowing the way that my mind reacts to things it likes, I simply dare not try heroin for fear that I&#039;ll enjoy it too much. <br /><br />I&#039;d argue that if you can relate to any of that little diatriebe you&#039;re probably best off steering clear too. I&#039;d never lecture or judge someone for trying it for the reasons Hitch laid out above, but I also think that POV is one which can only belong to someone who does not possess the characteristics/flaws which make people into addicts. <br />

				I believe everyone experiences with drugs slightly different from one another, depending on factors way too many factors to count (physical build, state of mind, cross tolerance, genetics, etc..).&nbsp; I wanna know what others think of H vs OC 80&#039;s or OC 160&#039;s if you ever had the chance to try them.&nbsp; I, like alot of others started on oxy, thinking that ill be fine cause its a very clean opiate and having no intention of ever doing heroin.&nbsp; Usual story, used once n a while turned to every other day turned to every day... then the money ran low and turned to h, so ever since then its been h and other than SR I rarely come across legit oxy&#039;s now, only opana which I dont like nearly as much.&nbsp; Maybe its just that since my tolerance was lower the experience was more intense or maybe I just have never gotten pure dope.&nbsp; Also I think if theres anyone who wants to try opiates should know the statistics of how many people get addicted for life after trying it, how many addicts kick the habbit, how many addicts relapse, and how many addicts end up dead from OD.

Really, opiates can truly screw up your life, finances, relationships, employment, and on and on. This is coming from a person who was an addict for 10 years. <br />If you really want to do it and you don&#039;t follow the advice not to, then you should get with someone you know who has used often (an H vet) and have them assist you. Don&#039;t do it alone! Have someone with you who can give you Narcan or do CPR or call 911. SERIOUSLY! <br />it&#039;s best just to stay away from the stuff. There are many alternatives that are just as enjoyable but not as dangerous.<br />Best of luck my friend.

				Heroin is fantastic, until it isn&#039;t. Then you start doing things you&#039;d never thought you&#039;d do just to get straight, not even get high, just to stop the jones. It&#039;s Russian Roulette. Some people try it and can take it or leave it, others immediately want to do it again and again and then you don&#039;t want to use it, you have to. My brother tried to warn me when I was young and just smoking weed, I didn&#039;t listen and it cost me dearly.<br />It&#039;s your body, your life, your choice. But if you end up with a life that sucks, don&#039;t say you weren&#039;t warned.<br />

It&#039;s difficult to comprehend how individuals believing themselves open-minded and progressive on drug philosophy could be so totally mind fucked by propaganda. Diacetylmorphine is still used, widely and effectively, in a medical setting as a first class analgesic. This is mostly in developing countries, for two reasons:<br />&nbsp; 1. They don&#039;t have the resources, medical expertise and technological ability to safely incorporate the modern powerful analgesics, like fentanyl, into their health systems.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. 1st world (Western) medical establishments have been forced to discard many effective drugs, like MDMA &amp; Diamorph, because of the insanity of the anti-drug brigade.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Heroin is a lovely, boring drug. Anyone (myself included) who uses meth, MDMA, LSD, weed, pretty much anything, you are all consuming a drug with far more potent psychoactive qualities, drugs with a far greater impact on your psychological state, than heroin. Heroin, used safely, decreases anxiety and produces a gentle euphoria and warm fuzzy body load.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Please try to avoid stigmatising individuals because of the personal choices they make about what they want to do with their bodies. That fundamental freedom is why we&#039;re all here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed, this is a drug forum, don&#039;t see how anyone here could be judgmental towards anyone over a certain drug. I&#039;ve never seen one person on here say anything negative about meth or how it&#039;s harmful, but heroin? Sure it has physical dependance so it gets pretty nasty to get addicted to, but for using it once in a while, it&#039;s just like any other drug. Most of the people criticizing are saying things based off other people&#039;s experiences, where the person couldn&#039;t have been responsible, rather than them trying heroin themselves.

				This is an interesting thread. I would say I have done just about every drug on the road and under the sun, you name it. From all of the psychedelics both classic and recently discovered, natural and synthetic, to weed (and concentrates), benzos, coke, crack, mdma, amyl nitrate even! Name it, I have probably done it or a close relative. But Heroin? It&#039;s like that big dark shadow that I have been dying to shine a light on but refuse to.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have an addictive personality which I am grateful for, I have always been able to do something in moderation and keep it from taking over my priorities. My favorite drug is Meth. I use it a few days a week when I have it and it&#039;s fantastic, I am productive, and use it for those positive attributes. I also never let it keep me up, I use it in the morning and then if I can&#039;t sleep around my normal bed time I will take a half Xanax bar to come down and go to sleep. I do this on and off a week or two out of a month. sometimes I stop for a half year or so here and there, but this has gone on for almost 14 years.<br /><br />When I tell close friends about it, they can&#039;t believe me. They ask me why I haven&#039;t lost teeth, my hair, withered away and gotten bad acne. Why? Because I learned early on the behaviors that lead to those effects and how to protect myself from them. I brush my teeth after every line. I don&#039;t smoke it. I know what the pitfalls of it are and how to avoid them so I don&#039;t become one of those meth stereotypes you always hear about. I have always kept my same weight, all my teeth, my hair and I look damn good if I believe my wife :P Most importantly, I didn&#039;t let it control me.<br /><br />I guess my point here is that even though I feel that I am able to control my use of even the hardest drugs, the mere fact that I have lost a half dozen friends (and 1 best friend and 1 family member) to heroin or opiates is enough to scare the shit out of me. A drug that is so easy to accidentally cross a line and die from isn&#039;t worth trying in my opinion. Yes, I am damn curious what it feels like, and I know deep down it probably wouldn&#039;t ruin me. But I think I am content to let that be the one drug I have never and will never try. <br /><br />I think reading experiences from other people who write far more eloquently than I will suffice to satisfy my curiosity.

				Yeah, I&#039;m seriously curious about Crystal Meth too. I&#039;ve done MDMA pills, and it was certainly a good experience. I saw fish swimming through the air in front of me, and a cartoon frog that had a big smile and waved. Seriously!<br /><br />My problem, however, is that I have schizophrenia. A number of years ago, I was heavily into weed, and I think it was a factor. Since then, I&#039;ve gotten off all the drugs, including cigarettes and alcohol. I&#039;ve been completely clean for years.<br /><br />But, there&#039;s still stuff I want to try. Meth is at the top of the list, and the jury is still out on H. I hear that Coke is very expensive for a short high. Also, I don&#039;t much like snorting, I would prefer to smoke.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Here is some real facts about heroin I suffer from chronic pain injuries etc I started as a weed smoker for years finally doctors out me on time release morphine 17 years ago it was helpful but I never really enjoyed it as I got older and pain got worse , I found I could not get enough Hash oil weed and and combination of those in me to help with constant pain .<br /><br />I was in Amsterdam for work a friend from Cali said to me bro you look in agony I have something that might help he gave me a small baggy of #3 brown Heroin , I snorted it and it actually worked it was the best relief I had had my mood changed it was great I actually felt good .<br />Now I am perscribed 400 mg of morphine per day plus diladid for breakthrough pain , still nothing is as good as Heroin it acts both as pain killer anti depresant&nbsp; .<br /><br />I go on and off heroin and morphine back and forth they have put me on fentanyle its not nearly as helpful as heroin , if you are not really hurting don&#039;t mess with it son.<br /><br />GF

I really wish I could have your relationship with the stuff. But what if our young friend is like me and not like you? He is in for a boatload of suffering. He also mentioned he has an illness. That illness is a very strong predictor of becoming addicted. I do understand everyone who doesn&#039;t see heroin as a big deal, thinks it&#039;s misunderstood, or can take it or leave it but is it worth risking someone&#039;s life to find out how you feel about heroin? Is that high really worth what might happen? I have difficulty imagining your temperament applied to me and you have difficulty imagining my temperament applied to you. That&#039;s why I say it&#039;s Russian Roulette, people who lose at that game can only lose once, but they lose (or are lost) for a very long time.

				I recently tried heroin, its one of the only things I haven&#039;t tried, I started with oxy&#039;s which are nice, then tried some #4 snorted, it was very nice, but unfortunately (or fortunately maybe!) I have a natural high tolerance, i.e. first time took 40mg of oxy, 60 to get a nice nod, with the snorted #4 took 100mg to get a nice nod, then had dodgy guts all the next day.<br />As far as effects are concerned, its not a patch on K, I have been into K for years and much prefer it, <br />H is nice but to me has no psychological depth and didn&#039;t leave me wanting more. I have no doubt it it could be highly addictive to the right person in the right situation however.<br />I would say try it once and see if you have an interest, it is well over-hyped IMO.

				I think Hitch&#039;s posts were pretty spot on. <br /><br />I think the thing that surprises people about heroin is how &quot;normal&quot; it feels. That&#039;s the catch. It feels warm, lucid and rather manageable until it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; Mileage varies. Not everyone makes ruin of their lives because of it but these people don&#039;t make headlines. &quot;Skilled professional maintains career and social life as well as a heroin habit.&quot; It happens but most of these sorts keep that stigma to themselves wherever possible. Therein are a few dark places because self-management is often tricky.&nbsp; It can be shocking the lies you&#039;ll tell yourself to maintain that blissful lull... or even just to avoid being sick. Generally I think it&#039;s a stone best left unturned because of how sneaky its grasp can become without you really realising it and when it has you, it has you.

The problem is that Heroin has the potential for addiction that coke or meth doesn&#039;t. Coke and meth addictions are for the most part psychological addictions, with little, if any, physiological components. It is also much easier to OD on H than on other drugs because purity can vary greatly from batch to batch, seller to seller. I know people who can do a little junk on a weekend once a month or so and then go about their business. Me (and others like me) want to do more and want to do it sooner. That&#039;s just the way we react to the drug. It can be a fabulous drug with little or no danger, under exactly the right circumstances. It can also be something that destroys you, body and soul, under the wrong circumstances. <br />Coke (crack in particular) and meth can both do that also, so I stay away from them. (Had the crack habit for 8 years, I am never, ever going to try meth because I can see the handwriting on the wall) and I recommend others stay away also. <br />After 10 years of being a junkie and watching my brother spend 30 years (before passing) as a junkie I admit I am biased against heroin and I am not going to apologize for that because I speak form experience. My experience isn&#039;t necessarily going to be your experience but why take the chance just to get high? I wouldn&#039;t wish those 10 years on my worst enemy and I certainly don&#039;t want any of you to go there either.
