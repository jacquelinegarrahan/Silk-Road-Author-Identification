				On MrCronks page it says &#039;As soon as you place an order and I have shipped it which is within 24hrs latest, I require all to finalise.&#039; Is it ever a good idea to finalize before you receive the goods? The unanimous agreement across these forums seems to be no, yet mr cronk is the second highest rated seller as far as I know and seems to make a huge number of sales. Also, what is the deal with his &#039;bulk stealth&#039; packages being listed seperately (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/47d1dc31a3) to the normal page? (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a8049ec639/10) I can&#039;t find any other vendor who does this. There are also no reviews on these items. Once I get comfortable with the SR and have a decent amount of purchases made I would like to start buying in bulk but I&#039;m not sure if I trust this and don&#039;t want to order from canada or the US where the best cannabis vendors seem to be.

				There can be a chance that he is legit but never take the chance. It has happened to me that I finalize early with vendors that have really good Feed back and a lot of transactions and when I decided to FE it they scammed me. not saying it will always happen but there is the possibility. Just depends if your willing to risk it.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not really willing to risk it, it&#039;s just a pity because he is so cheap compared to every other viable dealer (as i live in ireland). Any other cannabis vendors you&#039;d recommend?

His stealth is brilliant as well.

				I made my very first order with MrCronk,i didnt finalized early (but i asked if i had to and he didnt replied)<br />He told me that the delivery was supposed to be at most yesterday (still got nothing)<br />On his profile page is a few days that i find really controversial feedbacks.<br />Is there anybody who can give us a real feedback on this vendor? <br />8 days passed since my order and i dont really know if i should ask to resolve and get a rembursment or if i should wait (and let it auto finalize )<br />I see many people on forum/SR (visit the MrCronk page) complain about him.<br />Help us!!!

				I&#039;ve had 2 orders with MrCronk, both came within 24 hours, no problems. You should just try asking about it, and you don&#039;t have to let it auto finalise, as when the resolve button appears you can ask for a time extension or a refund
