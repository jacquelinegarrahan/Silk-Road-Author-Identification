				Hi,<br /><br />I bought bitcoins for the first time. I got them on bitcoin.de (similar to mtgox) via bank transfer (from my real bank account).<br /><br />Now I&#039;m ready to buy drugs on silk road. I never did it before. Is it anyhow possible to anonymize my bitcoins? I mean, right now the bitcoins are on my account (with my real name) on bitcoin.de. Can I simply transfer the money to another wallet with a fake name? Is it possible to backtrack bitcoins? What should I do?<br /><br />And I plan to send the drugs to my real address with real name. I order domestic and lsd, so I&#039;m pretty sure that no one is controlling the package. Is this save?<br /><br />Thanks!

				You can use sites like bitcoin fog or bit laundry. Just google bitcoin mixing services and do some research on which one is safe and good.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t use them. You can just request a new address from SR. The address is just an address. No one really knows who you&#039;re sending it to, just that you&#039;re sending it to another address.<br /><br />Obviously in theory the law enforcements could take over the site and look at previous transactions and work back to see who transferred money in but I think the chances of that happening and the effort it would take them isn&#039;t worth me risking my coins or paying the fees to use it to just receive someone else&#039;s dirty coins!

				Thanks for the answer. I will probably not use a bitcoin mixing service.<br /><br />What do you mean with requesting a new address on sr? How can I do that?<br /><br />And would it be harder for the law enforcement to trace back my initial account, if I send the money from my current account to another new created anonymous account to another, etc. (and maybe even split the money to different accounts/wallets?) Maybe I&#039;m also just to paranoid.

				i&#039;m guessing he&#039;s talking about the address SR gives you to send your bitcoins too. you can refresh and get a new one as many times as you like i think

				Yeah, I just mean the address that you send the bitcoins to. You can request a new one as many times as you like. Obviously SR may keep a record of the addresses used and accounts they are linked to, so on the off chance that the law enforcements got hold of the SR servers then they could trace the payments back. That would take a huge amount of effort and I doubt they&#039;d do that. Maybe you could make a fee online wallet at blockchain.info then send it there before sending it to SR. Just adds another step to cover up your tracks a bit. Then you could say something along the lines of &quot;I was buying them for a friend. I didn&#039;t know what he was doing with them.&quot; Plausible deniability might help! You never know. <br /><br />Also make sure you use PGP encryption for your address so that if it ever gets intercepted then they wont be able to see that it&#039;s your account.<br /><br />Sorry if that&#039;s too much info.

				i&#039;m a fairly new bitcoin/SR user myself, so i may not be the best source of information.<br />but i think this whole bitcoin process and everything would take way too long for any law enforcement to put any time into as it is, i feel secure and i don&#039;t launder my bitcoins

				i was told when i first started to never send my bitcoins directly to SR and always go through a wallet. i&#039;m not sure if it makes any difference but i doubt it hurts anything. if they become harder to trace if SR becomes compromised its probably worth the extra couple of minutes.

				If you keep bouncing coins off different wallets you can start to pay a decent sum in fees.

				Don&#039;t need to &quot;launder&quot; your coins. Use bitinstant then go to your private wallet then go to the road when your ready to dive in. bitinstant fee usually 9%. Wallet transfer fee .0005 btc
