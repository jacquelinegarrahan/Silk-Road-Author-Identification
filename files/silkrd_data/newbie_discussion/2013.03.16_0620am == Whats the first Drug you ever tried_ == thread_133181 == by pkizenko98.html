				My first legal drug was theobromine, and I&#039;m guessing many others is as well :D It is commonly found in chocolate and tea.<br /><br />Then later, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine...<br /><br />First illegal drug was THC, first psychedelic was LSD.

				DXM, legal of course, but I used it well beyond the recommended dose.&nbsp; Got to about the third plateau before spewing my brains out twice.<br /><br />Later that same day I tried Salvia extract mixed into a bowl of weed with some friends.&nbsp; I got the first hit out of the bowl, I was absolutely stunned by the experience.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t really feel the weed at all, and didn&#039;t end up becoming a regular weed smoker until about 4 years after that.

				I am a noob here and my first drug ever was a cigarette a cousin gave me when I was six, then came weed at about 11 or 12 y.o.<br />Now I don&#039;t smoke, I have an e-cig, good liquid and just smoke some weed from time to time. What I like is psychedelics. DOxs, LSD, AMT, DMT, psilocetin, and other 4-substituted tryptamines.<br />I love silk road.

				Unintentional high? Xanax. I had problems with anxiety and took a decent amount and didn&#039;t realize how high it was going to get me. I was probably 13. First intentional high?

				First drug I tried was weed, found out it doesn&#039;t mix with me. Makes me wanna get into fights with people, which is extremely abnormal.<br /><br />Then I discovered coke which sorta mellows me out at a high enough dose, I&#039;m pretty bass ackwards apparently.

				Mushrooms back in the days in the UK when they were legal to buy, had a shop that sold 20g for a tenner, i was 18 then and well into Bill Hicks which had some say on the matter and i can only thank the late great Bill Hicks for helping to expand my mind and experiences. Bar a few drugs have had pretty much everything since. Weed came after that then LSD, Ketamine, MDMA/X and so on .&nbsp;

				A fat joint together with my mates from school. We were camping in the mountains and spend the night laughing our asses off at the worst jokes I have heard so far&nbsp; :)<br />Later I tried mushrooms a few times, because they grew just next to my parents house, but i ate too many of them one night and didnt touch them since then.<br />I only used mdma and speed when for the first time when I got 30. Not sure if it was a good thing that I waited so long to give mdma a try, speed on the other hand is not really my cup of tea...<br /><br />

				well this goes back some 35 years but, in order:&nbsp; alcohol, tobacco, weed, hash, LSD, coke, H, benzos, oxy.<br /><br />In hindsight: H is best to calm you from ANY concerns, coke is best to energize you, LSD is best for insight into your own soul. I&#039;d say tobacco and alcohol are worst; and yet they&#039;re the only legal ones (though, rightfully, legal weed is pretty well here).

				Nutmeg. Was feeling depressed one night, heard it could get you high. Ate a 26g tube of spice blend nutmeg and went to sleep at about 2am. Woke up at 8am fucked up beyond belief, struggled to walk to the toilet even. The effects lasted all day and even lingered somewhat into the next day, but the nausea was not worth it.
