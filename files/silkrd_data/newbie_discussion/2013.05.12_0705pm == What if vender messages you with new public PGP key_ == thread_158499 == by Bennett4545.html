				I&#039;m getting a little worried about a vender I have set a small order with.&nbsp; It is the first time I have used anyone who didn&#039;t have dozens of positive feedbacks.&nbsp; This guy specifically asked in the listing to use a real address and name.&nbsp; <br /><br />I sent him an address to the public PGP key he listed.&nbsp; He replied in a message, encrypted to my public key, and gave me a new public key to use for him.&nbsp; I replied with my address again, but this time to his new key.<br /><br />I am now thinking that this is sketchy?&nbsp; Some talks of hacked accounts in some of the other sub-forums. I can&#039;t tell if he has changed the public key in the listings. At least I did not use my real address.<br /><br />Any thoughts for this newbie?

You would need to know his former public PGP key to be able to verify if the new key is signed with it.<br /><br />It does seem strange that he could not decrypt the message you sent him, so provided a new PGP key for you to use. I would personally have steered clear of this one, though it may turn out that there is nothing wrong at all and the vendor simply didn&#039;t take the precaution of backing up their private PGP key and their PGP program somehow became corrupted.<br /><br />Just to clarify, other accounts were NOT hacked - they were phished. The vendors in those cases went to a phishing site that was set up to target vendors, entered their login details and PIN and lost control of their accounts as a result.<br /><br />Please note that Silk Road will NEVER ask you for your PIN, no matter what.
