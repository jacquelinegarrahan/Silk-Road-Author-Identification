				Hey guys, currently I&#039;m trying to use the security method from the &quot;All in one guide&quot; posted by John Keats (*see link) but then I read about programs like Tails, Trucrypt and Virtual Machine... <br /><br />* http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />I want to start vending eventually and want the best setup but there doesn&#039;t seem to be a consensus anywhere about what the best security setup is. Is Tails an alternative to Liberte? Apparently Trucrypt doesnt work well no USB so is Trucrypt used when you are using non USB Tails? I really don&#039;t know shit about Tails, Trucrypt and Virtual Machine in general.<br /><br />I also have a problem when booting Liberte from a USB. It will get to &quot;Starting in laptop mode&quot; or something asking me for a passcode. In John Keats guide he said a passcode would be auto made for you or some shit but nope. And there is mention of a loading bar or completion bar - I do not have any bar. I&#039;m using Liberte 2012.3... I&#039;ve done everything the guide told me to. <br /><br />Any input on these issues would be really appreciated. I&#039;ve done many searches and cannot find the adequate info for my issues and lack of knowledge. I just want the best security setup one can have.<br /><br />Regards, Anon

				okay. I am new to this, however. I may have some advice. I followed the kean instructions as well. What you have to understand with liberte on the flashdrive is. Once you boot that fucker up. and put that pass in. it loads you to that home page. That&#039;s it. you have done it, it does the encrypting for you. it has pgp built right in. I use Truecrypt to encrypt my files on my main drive. for example I am going to use bitcoin offline for my &quot;vault&quot; from which I move to my online wallet. you can find at blockchain through to liberte browser after boot up<br /><br />If you&#039;re not sure if you&#039;re safe, from the home screen of the browser. click the tor check. I am just hung up on the coins at them moment. However, I believe I have it understood now. I think I&#039;ll buy an awesome counter culture SR shirt. <br /><br />You have no way of being traced, even if they get that lflash. good luck cracking that fucker. I hope this helps. Happy traillllssss tooooo you...till weeeee meeeeetttt againnnn.
