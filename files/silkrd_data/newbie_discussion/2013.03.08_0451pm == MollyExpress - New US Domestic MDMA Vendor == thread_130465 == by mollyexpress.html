				Hi guys,<br /><br />I am a new US Domestic vendor here on the road. I will be selling high quality Dutch MDMA (+/- 80% pure) and perhaps some other items in the near future.<br /><br />To get started, I would like to offer 5 free samples of 225mg MDMA to established buyers in return for feedback. Ideally, you should have more than 50 posts here in the forums and be a member for more than 2 months. My only requirement is that your tolerance is low (i.e. you haven&#039;t rolled recently) and you must be willing to sample and post your review within one week from receipt of shipment. I believe in the quality of my product and I am confident that you will like it. My sample product listing is in stealth mode, so PM me here or contact me on the road if you want to volunteer for a sample and I will send you the link to order it. My other listings will remain in stealth mode until all the samples have arrived and my first customers are satisfied.&nbsp; All samples will be shipped on Monday morning.<br /><br />I will only be shipping domestically, so please do not ask if you are outside the states.<br /><br />Much love to everyone and I look forward to doing business with all of you in the near future.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.18 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBFE5Vd0BCADsRliwg/l6s47GRkwRTlvhzA8afJaX8EaPz59zR5z7sBZuUQng<br />j3nKXggYfcPkMHwW3pEKMxUWjBTylsmupGY000XFXBgEw7y+AhLZqjrcvlBziETP<br />wQjkjnJ7NWgMx6MMDvgwOGoBAKVZsFm/5CojJLrrH6HMtdG3XklVmYvv+VUQcNPV<br />hrk4aTQiPQOIXPcEmcg7PagezqzqPkaWMtnf1MOyuLlEkfOyxIO53Z7sjAgTX92+<br />x3vYuK/S24F0LoYvyJ356LfXhDpkev3HeMaE/ZjoaMl5N/UHdYgvPlYlk3EeWweI<br />sH89M+GnSt95Ay96bdHdzOjMj/oS0cqAa1e1ABEBAAG0J21vbGx5ZXhwcmVzcyA8<br />bW9sbHlleHByZXNzQHRvcm1haWwub3JnPokBOQQTAQIAIwUCUTlV3QIbLwcLCQgH<br />AwIBBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEB5Fql1iRZ2E94gIAMHbeK+avU6uhf9f<br />XFl3F9qes8Vd0C6owmiqSKStEIc200OgpEQRjYnNAH1p38kHE6Os3rhV4TA6ifp5<br />ZA21mpodc5dsSR5fANyWo+7uPjLLTQH494mnA4XD47KQrclavEDV5geQz8do7e8u<br />up1cKPWKYMgueEzbZLMJAxyQX7xeFICndfiUndbNi7j67DT5joOStk+HLXqfmhHu<br />CPB3QXbn02ts96zU1ENUhpC2IKTjJtui0oi4aX9JJDp5JQwGh0PrpxPnLgVK7742<br />uyo7R+SwmGhBJYgHj2LgbsvwhKEDEmUXDHGBTn4hDGDvW3OjbOw8e2JBe0ZoHyAo<br />LvVBm+O5AQ0EUTlV3QEIAMgRy22iunna71MiI3lJ3V2f4STM4I/cLQPQ/10GyLAO<br />P6qEDBhclCBWBdH7m4uQDOVlHNUo/S9KmTdvgZn9shhUV0K7+TTL27RhL3LpSzEe<br />+jDxvz5rfZYKO4PrtcYI3KbC6us4szuF6lcZEfSrVtpPvn0Nltjrq6XTp5JP83C7<br />NIWTBzXOMvCUOyC1yWmbcKUdp1/mgPndZx+gm5I9vvArVkfunX69uAnrTiWycfdx<br />RKMP1eOup1ta8aaOR4kFyLc9s2H6Y0ZMeva1QorGBI5xrWphhVbMy8XfAU0A+NSb<br />JvIEaeYvPj4U+T9+Q13V3XcoUTy+yrHNrB69DQb+FzkAEQEAAYkCPgQYAQIACQUC<br />UTlV3QIbLgEpCRAeRapdYkWdhMBdIAQZAQIABgUCUTlV3QAKCRAO1GGjSSJPDv1a<br />B/4katz7JqLhfMDcxaxD8yKMpNCE9YO8/Q9kLhBifW/nxzcMT5S8pfr3lLO34yDq<br />SR8mpg7RfNX6t0l1GQk2RlMCsqayE303zAiPzBK7BFaBJRgGZqmJRqn/4dJaupPU<br />MJl6hP5GIqpsB9O6CtTLkUyPn8ZHGYUARr1pegqO0VsRL+tE7ci5wWD2J+uoCdGA<br />KkEAJzw0xLfWa/Q7b1HXUum9SE4VoLhHb0/t13XdZJsSw1mHh0QP5XxLmatUpFjT<br />rkA+2xUQYvH1TyKTFn1GBJhopek2bJLBxYguhfxmy/9q4O5vo9GVyj8Oxk5etj80<br />pi0JX3pLmgsnvIjSUjYRfqduKxMIAOOReoHQsyjIWCjqnfeL6/zlnfVg/stHUM5B<br />LMDw8kvxy/O53+VcJL3BCdyeeJRELTdjz8CMxhRZVTdwCRt2xElHWGi7eOf3edPc<br />4dCSwx7W4ICx6gyjFGHXdV3BM7DeJRbgDEY60lJOwxrx41PYjKgUYS2+Q319nOSM<br />TJeEiWRok8ehgJFYwvOXnMMkClaeDqJ/P7ZNtE/16A2Tm8X43C2Kdp5dM66qB4Tc<br />nZB+XowfQ0uAXnz9NfFr9DGH3GP9mnzjfEpbvYE7lcNLgyNooy7Wob51vA+afS1f<br />5DBJ8nH3HHtXwlSWI2EzR79QvvFmyvjZONsZGqj7q3QwcREJe4s=<br />=Mowc<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				Ive been member for roughly 3-4 months, however I only have 1 completed transaction for roughly $60 with a 10g order of mdma in transit atm. I also plan on rolling tomorrow night at a rave, but that&#039;ll only be my 2nd time rolling so if I give it a week or 2 I should be set to roll again.<br /><br />If I fit for a free sample lemme know homie

				I am not really your ideal candidate for this.&nbsp; I am new here and not an influencer or engager due to my lack of&nbsp; tenure.&nbsp; I hope this changes one day.&nbsp; However, my crystal ball broke last week so I offer no promises.<br /><br />I am familiar with PiHkal, The Hive, Speedfreak from IRC, JLF, Scientific America, Meglomanic&#039;, these hippies in SF - &quot;Rainbow Family&quot; and PoP3ye oh remember those days.&nbsp; I was also a mod on those forums.&nbsp; If you believe that I have a fish to sell you too!&nbsp; At least I know the right names to drop.&nbsp; I remember the first time I was introduced to Molly.&nbsp; I am a pretty typical hetromale.&nbsp; I wound up getting a massage from another guy that night, not sexual either.&nbsp; Still strange to look back on.&nbsp; The first thing I was told and last thing I remember:&quot;taste it&quot;.&nbsp; It seems to be what every connoisseur wants their family to do when introduced to Molly.&nbsp; It is something you never forget - bitter &quot;sweet&quot; absorption. <br /><br />&nbsp;While I might not be what you are looking for.&nbsp; This offer is what I was looking for but never thought would come up.&nbsp; I just asked my girl if she would roll with me, 4 days ago.&nbsp; She said she feels too old, she is past that point in her life.&nbsp; It has been several years for her.&nbsp; I asked because it is our anniversary much sooner than later.&nbsp; I thought MDMA would be a great way to celebrate!&nbsp; I was shot down!&nbsp; However, if I came to her with a sample of Molly and explained it was our duty to write an Erowid style hour by hour trip report. . .&nbsp; I am 100% confident we would both meet your expectations rolling &amp; rising to the occasion..&nbsp; If she still refused - to hell with her! .I&#039;d just have to do it all on my own.&nbsp; It has been about 1 1/2 yrs since I have rolled.&nbsp; It has been a 5 + yrs since I have done Molly where I could vouch for the cook.&nbsp; Interestingly I remember it well.

				I don&#039;t qualify by your OP, but I would be interested in a sample.<br /><br />I just recently put in a order for 10g of MDMA from SuperTrips.&nbsp; It will take his a while to get here and I&#039;d like to find a domestic vendor with a similar product that isn&#039;t too pricey.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 2 transactions and almost $600 spent.

				Hey man, this sample sounds great!<br /><br />I&#039;m not an exact match for what you&#039;re looking for, but I&#039;ve very close to 50 posts and have been a member for roughly two months if I&#039;m not mistaken (I haven&#039;t exactly been counting)<br /><br />I&#039;ve rolled plenty of times so I know the good&#039;s and bad&#039;s, but by the time this would get to me I will have been good for about a month, which is plenty of time for me to reset (I&#039;m somewhat of a lightweight, so I don&#039;t need a super long time)<br /><br />If my bio works out for ya let me know man, I&#039;d love to help you out.

				BTW, just wanted to add that I believe you all will be very pleased with the stealth and I look forward to your comments on it.<br /><br />I plan to start listing items as soon as some of the feedback starts to come in.

				My sampled landed yesterday :) 2 Days east coast! The label was hand written instead of typed, this doesn&#039;t bother me but I know it is a concern for some. The produce was vac sealed. I would prefer some tape to keep closed but other than that the packaging was adequate for domestic not the stealthiest I&#039;ve seen but no complaints.<br /><br />The vendor has been great so far! Very generous sample for 2. It will be a few days before I am able to test, but I will&nbsp; post review then. I don&#039;t get much of a smell, the product looks good with small clear crystals and some light tan sand.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks ME, will test the gear ASAP, if it is all good you will be my go to guy for domestic molly 8) <br /><br />

				Thanks guys for the comments - I spoke to Whiteout and he lended some great advice on improving my shipping. Yes I vacuum seal it but I will probably go the route of also using Mylar heat shield bags moving forward to improve the stealth. And I understand the concerns about hand written labels and will be moving to printed labels in the not too distant future.<br /><br />Please keep me informed of any suggestions you have in terms of improving my stealth, my policies, and my pricing. I was a SR buyer for a long time before I decided to become a vendor so I very much understand the buyer&#039;s concerns and I promise to work diligently to improve on my service. The molly is top notch so there&#039;s not much room for improvement there, but down the road I may decide on running it through additional acetone washes to continue to reduce impurities. As it stands now, it is already a great product nonetheless.<br /><br />Very much appreciate everyone&#039;s input so far and I definitely will work as hard as I can to become the top US domestic vendor on SR. With your help, I believe that can be achieved.

				Hello all! Finally recollected myself enough to hop on here and give MollyExpress her promised thorough review! Let&#039;s begin.<br /><br />Well I can normally gauge a vendors quality by the first several messages and response times. I was getting good vibes from M/E right out of the gate. Phenomenal customer service. Even have began chatting on a different level about other various silk road things. Such as some tips and stuff.<br /><br />I love the fact that any package I can order from this vendor will take 2 days to get to my doorstep, maybe 3 if a small delay is thrown in there. I also love that they are domestic so nothing to really be paranoid about...<br /><br />Ok so let&#039;s get down to business.<br /><br />Shipping- Stealth I cannot comment much on as mine was just a sample and it was plenty sufficient. The main thing I stress on is their shipping time once again, probably the fastest domestic out there. <br /><br />Communication- I loved talking to this vendor and exchanging knowledge. Always replied to my messages within hours &amp; got back to me on pricing for larger orders immediately.<br /><br />Product<br />Amount- 225mg&#039;s Very Generous IMO, even claimed that they would have sent two after learning I had another tester interested. <br />Purity- I did not run actual lab test but I will put this in the ballpark of around 84-87% based on experience with other known %&#039;s&nbsp; No lie. <br />Color- Pretty damn white honestly, had a nice white coating on the bigger rocks but the sand was slightly tanish/yellowish, very much less than other darker MDMA I have seen on the <br />Composition- I actually had some pretty nice pebbles for a 225mg sample. I can see bigger orders having some nice stones for sure.<br /><br />THE ROLLLLLLL<br /><br />Well my method of consumption was through doing 2 separate lines. Did my first line at about 75mg just to test the waters a little as I have not rolled in some time. I felt a very nice euphoric feeling slowly coming over me, directly after I made a lengthy conversation over the phone, needless to say by the end of the phonecall I was getting the sweaty palms &amp; amplified touching sensations. So about 45min after the first dose I man&#039;d up and snorted the remaining of the original 225. This is where I really started to like how things were going. Watched some workaholics and when the second dosage kicked in I was on cloud 9, well not my mind. I mean I was having uncommon thoughts I suppose but nearly all of the roll was felt in the body. I was in control the whole time but it was like my body didn&#039;t want me to be. It was a very gradual buildup, but it was one of the things where you can tell your getting there but when it hits IT HITS. HARD. All of the great roll effects that you would normally get, I got but on a little bit of a better level. Overall product was A1 and I love the vendor. Will likely have my business pretty soon so I won&#039;t have to be so paranoid about non-domestic.....<br /><br />

Let me know how it goes and enjoy your edm artist next week.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, you read that correctly :) I received my sample today so I&#039;ll point out a couple things I noticed.<br /><br />Packaging: As others noted and MollyExpress has already addressed stealth could be improved by printing addresses. Aside from that the stealth was fine for a domestic order, but you can never be to safe.<br /><br />Appearance: I&#039;m very happy with how this MDMA looks. It looks like it was thoroughly washed by the cook. VERY light tan hue which is what I personally like to see.<br /><br />Smell: Light licorice smell which again is what I like to see (or smell I should say)<br /><br />By all accounts this looks and smells like some banging MDMA. The review above me makes me eager to give this MDMA a try which I will be doing in the near future. Thanks again for the sample!

				Hey, got my sample a day earlier than expected, and the stealth was very good. Vacuum seal was a nice touch. Tried it today, and let me say that it was very high quality. If you are considering order from this vendor, I would not fret. He is very professional, and his product is top notch.

				Hey guys, just wanted to let you know that my listings will be up in the next few days, and I think you guys will be impressed with my prices. I am trying to be as competitive on pricing as possible while still being able to make a small profit.<br /><br />I just ordered a bunch of Moisture Barrier Bags and these will be used on future shipments as soon as I receive them. In addition, all labels will now be printed as well. The rest of my stealth will remain intact.<br /><br />Thanks again for those of you who received samples who actually took the time to review my goods. I will be happy to extend some extras to you guys if you choose to order from me in the future.<br /><br />Talk to you soon and hope you all had a great weekend.

				REPORT: Please keep in mind I was rolling at a show so the timeframes may be slightly off. I was at an EDM concert<br /><br />Dropped 150mg <br />Hours 0-1<br />Didn&#039;t feel too much until about 45 min in when I felt my come up. It was very smooth and I really started to get in tune with the music and enjoy myself. <br /><br />Hours 1-2: I started to roll even harder, really getting into the music drawing stares from quite a few around me. Dropped the remaining 75mg about 1.5 hours in while I was still peaking<br /><br />Hours 2-5 Peaking nearly the whole time and it was epic. I was dancing my ass off continuously throughout. As the final set came to a close I turned to my friends and said &quot;this has to be a joke right?&quot; I just did not want to leave. The whole 5+ hours felt way too fast, but it was one of the most enjoyable concerts I have been too.<br /><br />Hours 5-7 Fairly smooth comedown, took me about 2 hours to be able to fall asleep. It was an enjoyable 2 hours though cause I just relaxed with friends reliving the concert.<br /><br /><br />Molly Express&#039;s MDMA is = to or greater than LL&#039;s and that is saying something. It is hard for me to say as both gave me a fantastic experience, but I believe this MDMA is the best I have taken to date

I&#039;ll be using printed labels moving forward and also stealth will be improved later in the week by using moisture barrier bags in addition to vacuum sealing.<br /><br />I think you guys are going to find my pricing very attractive as well. As usual, my shipping times are lighting fast, seems like 2-3 days is the standard for all the samples I sent out.<br /><br />Happy rolling!

				What&#039;s up all, just received a message from MollyExpress about a new sample. Going to be getting a new one sent so I can check out the shipping improvements. I am so glad to see this vendor is getting his shit together before going in full swing. This just means a easier process for all of us in the end. Will report back with what will likely be a awesome review for a great soon to be vendor!

				Just FYI, there are no more samples anymore guys, sorry but I&#039;ve given out almost 15 samples at this point, so I think the quality speaks for itself. We&#039;ve had some great reviews and for those of you that took the time out to help me in this little science experiment, thanks! I hope you all enjoyed the rolls!<br /><br />BTW, I offered Whiteout another sample because he had some great advice on improving my stealth and shipping,&nbsp; As such, I am sending him another sample so that he can take a look at the new stealth I&#039;ll be using going forward.<br /><br />NO MORE SAMPLES guys... :) Listings will be up very shortly so you can order...

				Listings are up now guys. For the quality of the molly here the prices are very competitive, cheaper than any of the other vendors that are offering high quality molly. And don&#039;t forget that shipping time is usually only 2-3 days...<br /><br />Thanks for all your support and happy rolling!

Shipping should be done in MBBs for all orders by this weekend, however for those ordering 5g listings or more, I have an ingenious stealth method that I guarantee won&#039;t arouse suspicion. I guarantee you that this is one of the best stealth methods you are going to see in the domestic US. Whiteout will be reviewing my stealth shortly so he can give you an idea, but I promise you that you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br /><br />Hopefully you&#039;ll trust me and as the reviews start to roll in you will see what I am talking about.

				First of all, I want to apologize to MollyExpress for how late this review is.&nbsp; At some point my mail man, or more likely a substitute, put your package at a very weird place on my porch.&nbsp; I had chocked it up as a loss, but here it is!&nbsp; &nbsp;the sample was brownish crystal and mostly moonrocks.&nbsp; I ate just over 100 mg last night and rolled quite hard for 4 or 5 hours, really peaking for 2 to3.&nbsp; The comedown was very comfortable and sleep came easy.&nbsp; No communication was really necesarry as I wasn&#039;t too worried about a free sample showing up.&nbsp; Packaging was simple and vac sealed, but no real stealth.&nbsp; Fine for domestic.&nbsp; Kept the moisture out during some rainy days on my porch, LOL! ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Quality is totally fair for the price and it came, so this vendor seems totally legit!&nbsp; may order soon myself!<br /><br />Recommend A++<br /><br />-nwpg

				Thank you&nbsp; mollyexpress for letting me review your high quality mdma.&nbsp; 5/5 for the quality. I do believe it&#039;s 84% like it says on your vendor page. Mine was all small chunky crystals that looked just like your pictures. It had the taste and smell of some of the best I had ever eaten. Very bitter and took a lot of drinking to get it all down. I noticed the euphoria kicking in very smoothly after about 25 minutes. Very pure and very strong.<br /><br />About an hour into it my eyes were fully dilated and the empathy was great. Every song was my favorite one after the other lol. I been rolling hard now for 6 hours and the come down is in effect and very smooth as well. I am having after glow effects now and feel really great with a lot of energy.<br /><br />5/5 for the nice stealthy and quick delivery. Wow that was fast! As long as quality is consistent I&#039;ll be buying my mdma from you from now on. Nice job with the printed labels and the double vac seal.<br /><br />5/5 for the weight. My 225 mg sample weighed 231 mg. So I checked my scales by placing a nickel on it and it weighed 5.02 grams so Thanks for the heavy sample. It felt to me like there were no cutting agents and no anxiety. Just a strong smooth roll. I&#039;m still quite buzzed and your molly is the only thing I&#039;ve had today. <br /><br />Mollexpress is going to do great here. I&#039;ll be placing my review in numerous other threads. I&#039;ll give you more plus karma when it lets me. Thanks again and I&#039;ll be ordering some soon.

				Just pulled the trigger on 10g! Can&#039;t wait to try this stuff out. I&#039;m a frequent user of SuperTrips/UGS as well as LuckyLuc/Empathy101&#039;s stuff, so I&#039;ll be sure to write a review in comparison to their goods, for those that are interested. It&#039;s always nice to find good domestic sellers, now I just need to find the very best :)

				***** I&#039;ve been searching 9 months for a vendor who can excel in the 3 main areas (Product, Shipping, &amp; Communication.) I&#039;ve found vendors who were great in 1 or 2 areas but never all 3...until now!<br /><br />ME has exceeded my expectations and proven to be the best overall vendor I&#039;ve encountered on the Road! His product is amazing (but whose isn&#039;t?) but where he goes above &amp; beyond is in the shipping &amp; communication departments! Hands down best shipping you will see (that&#039;s all I&#039;m saying...) ME also quickly responded to every message and concern I had and went out of his way to accommodate my request.

				<br />I received my large, generous, MDMA samples from MollyExpress three days after I placed my order. He&#039;s on top of his game both professionally in his customer interactions and in regards to his product quality.<br /><br />I&#039;m an semi-experienced tryptamine user, having had many mushroom, dmt, and ayahuasca sessions in the last four years. I had not yet had any MDMA. <br /><br />I decided to sample the product before going in deep. I have circumstances in the timing which didn&#039;t allow me to go with a full dose, so I looked up the dosing and learned that 80mg is a fairly common light dose.<br /><br />I took a pre-loading dose of:<br />&nbsp;100mg R-Lipoic Acid<br />&nbsp;500mg Acetyl L-Carnitine<br /><br />I post-loaded before bed time with<br />&nbsp;100mg R-Lipoic Acid<br />&nbsp;500mg Acetyl L-Carnitine<br />1000mg Vitamin C<br />&nbsp;100mg 5-htp<br /><br />T+40 Minutes<br /><br />I feel a tingle up my spine, and a warmth over my body. I feel like im tingling, and glowing a little bit. It feels nice. If this is all that results from this, I&#039;m happy with that. If there&#039;s more, then that&#039;s great too.<br /><br />I have some anxiety, mostly over having a new experience, excitement. I&#039;m cleaning the kitchen and house while listening to music, staying positive and getting things done.<br /><br />I feel a bit trippy. Like, im on a tryptamine psychadelic, very mild. It&#039;s nice! I&#039;m loving this gentle sunday ride so far.<br /><br />T+50 Minutes<br /><br />Im feeling woooonderful. I was feeling kinda of down and tired before I embarked on this. I&#039;m feeling greeat now. Im going to keep listning to music and cleaning the house. I figure I&#039;ll be productive while enjoying this so much :-) I&#039;m feeling the love!<br /><br />T+1 Hour 30 Minutes<br /><br />Feeling great! I guess I feel the need to write this a lot :-) Listening to some dance music, feels good. I am already working out in my head how big my first order is going to be for MollyExpress! <br /><br />This is halarious. The song &quot;I guess I didn&#039;t know&quot; (techno) is playing, and im listening to those words. All my life I was anti-drugs. I shunned anyone who even smoked marijuana through past 30 years of age. Now I&#039;m rolling for my first time, and loving it, and over and over this song is saying &quot;I guess I didn&#039;t know&quot;, which is me saying, &quot;guys sorry for the judgement, I guess I didn&#039;t know&quot;. Well, know I know. Damn! This is so awesome. Love love love love.<br /><br />T+3 Hours<br /><br />Still feeling great, body buzz, slightly trippy. Getting so thirsty! Going to drink a bunch of water. It&#039;s been about an hour from when I started really feeling these effects so I think this is the peak for this trip. Not bad for 80mg. I want more, but can&#039;t right now. I&#039;ll also get a good judgement on how my comedown will be if any at all. <br /><br />T+5 Hours<br /><br />Coming down a bit. Damn I want more :-)<br /><br />T+6 Hours<br /><br />Feeling good. Basking in a pleasurable body high. Just smoked some weed, and it&#039;s re-sparking the MDMA feeling. Very lovely!<br /><br />The next day:<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel any comedown at all! I don&#039;t feel depressed or anything. If anything, I&#039;m in a good mood and happy :-) <br /><br />I&#039;ll be ordering more soon MollyExpress! I&#039;ll also be going much deeper possibly next weekend with the rest of my samples and my SO will join me. I will write a new trip report for that. I figure with such a small dose this time, I should still be good to go tolerance wise. I still have well over 345mg left.<br />

				Just checked the mail this afternoon and found MollyExpress&#039; package sitting there waiting for me! Stealth was better than anything I&#039;ve seen for domestic orders. I don&#039;t know if I got the updated stealth but it works. My gram consists of sand, shards, and a couple rocks. Product is a nice clear to off white color. Smells fantastic. I&#039;ll be taking a picture of test results as soon as I get it all done. Thanks MollyExpress! Looking forward to doing more business with you in the future. Anyone that pushes testing kits and safety is awesome in my book.

				Bitfrost,<br /><br />&quot;I Guess I Didn&#039;t Know&quot; is really appropriate for good MDMA. A buddy of mine recently had his first *real* Molly experience a few weeks ago with me, and kept saying the same thing. He had previously encountered a lot of bunk shit and just never felt the effects everyone always talks about. It was great seeing him smiling being like, &quot;You were right dude!&quot;<br /><br />Needless to say, can&#039;t way to blow his mind with this stuff.

Stealth was better than anything I&#039;ve seen for domestic orders. I don&#039;t know if I got the updated stealth but it works. My gram consists of sand, shards, and a couple rocks. Product is a nice clear to off white color. Smells fantastic. I&#039;ll be taking a picture of test results as soon as I get it all done. Thanks MollyExpress! Looking forward to doing more business with you in the future. Anyone that pushes testing kits and safety is awesome in my book.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for your comments on the stealth. I worked hard on this and yes this is the the new and improved stealth, for the most part. All 5g and larger orders will use this stealth method with one exception, I am now adding Moisture Barrier Bags in addition to the vac-sealing, to prevent any odors from leaking whatsoever.

And considering the risk vs. reward, I would say at that price range the risks far outweigh the reward. After crunching the numbers, the lowest I will probably be able to get this down to is in the $50 per gram range for the 10g orders.<br /><br />Like I&#039;ve said before, if you don&#039;t mind the wait and going through customs, ordering from abroad is certainly the best option in terms of price per gram. What people are paying for with my service is high touch contact and customer service, a quality product, lightning fast shipping, and probably the best stealth you are going to see domestically.<br /><br />I totally understand if you choose another vendor and my feelings won&#039;t be hurt in the least.<br /><br />All the best and Happy Rolling folks!

				Great! Keep us all posted. I have another batch due here in a few days from a competitor (honestly, only because I didn&#039;t know about you at the time) -- I&#039;d be happy to do a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; comparison, as you two are at around the same price point and both US domestic. <br /><br />However, this competitor is also a larger operation and I prefer to work with someone who is focused on refining their market to be a flawless transaction, rather than cover everything. I also really appreciate your accessibility for communication. <br /><br />I got money set aside for 5G from you next week then!

				Here we go! Tested MollyExpress&#039; product and the results came back absolutely amazing. Both the Mecke and Marquis reagents came back with violent reactions with a hint of smoke. The Simons reagent turned to a nice deep cobalt blue in a beautiful swirl. The whole gram weighed out to 1.06.

My listings are going back up just a few minutes. I&#039;m only putting up listings for 5g and 10g at the moment but expect to have my 1g listings back up shortly. Thanks for all your patience and appreciate your business.<br /><br />Just a recap guys, wanted to let you all know that I am shipping a quality product, and the stealth is unparalleled. In addition to vac-sealing, I am using MBBs on all my orders. On top of that, I only mark &quot;in-transit&quot; once I&#039;ve actually shipped the item, and once it&#039;s in transit it usually only takes about 2-3 days to deliver. I&#039;ve had a 100% success ratio of successful deliveries and happy customers out of 37 transactions so far. I promise to do my best to keep up the standards.<br /><br />One final note to add, my costs went up slightly to acquire the product, so I&#039;m going to be listing my 5gs at $290 and my 10gs at $530. But I am going to do everything possible to continue to try and reduce the price a bit more. I want everyone to get the best product possible at the best prices.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone and happy rolling!

I am also looking to figure out how to use gift codes so I can offer small discounts for repeat customers.<br /><br />I also appreciate you finalizing when your received your order. As you know this is a cash and carry business. I need people to finalize quickly so I can re-up the product and continue to bring you guys a great product at competitive pricing. I&#039;m running into far too many customers that are letting it go to the brink of 17 days or even auto-finalizing which is definitely slowing down my operation.<br /><br />Thanks again for your business and I hope you enjoy your rolls :)

				Hey guys,<br /><br />A quick update that I feel is in order with all the wild fluctuations lately in BTC. I know a lot of customers on the road are worried if vendors are going to be honoring orders, and I want to clear the air for any of you who might be wondering...<br /><br />All orders that were placed with me over the last few days have been shipped. I have continued to honor my pricing despite the BTC taking a huge dive. I use escrow hedging so my profits are largely protected while the money is in escrow, but I had a ton of orders which finalized right when the BTC was at roughly $266. Since then it&#039;s dropped to $70 (a 74% reduction). So I have taken a huge loss and basically ended up shipping out product at below my cost to actually purchase the goods to begin with. I still have some inventory left and I just wanted to reassure you all that I am continuing to honor orders and making sure that you get a quality product and that you get it quickly. I do hope the BTC situation stabilizes because I really can&#039;t afford to take any more loss.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />After my current inventory runs out, I might have to take a little breather for a bit, as I now barely have enough funds to re-up. Ahhh... such is life and this is the game we play here on the road, but rest assured I will be back and better than ever.<br /><br />Thanks guys for being such awesome customers and I have really enjoyed bringing some happiness into your lives.

				Yep, it&#039;s screwing both vendor and buyers alike. If I had started vending earlier I probably could have weathered this storm but as luck would have it my vending started in earnest when the price was already near the top, even with my escrow hedging once those orders finalized my wallet dropped accordingly.<br /><br />And Panzerknacker, while I appreciate the sentiment, I didn&#039;t mean to insinuate that anybody has fucked with me... all this is mostly the fault of speculators, and probably a rogue group of technical traders who had the wherewithal to DDoS Mt. Gox and the other exchanges so they could buy back in at record lows. Perhaps we will never know the reasons, but yeah we are all feeling the pain.<br /><br />I will have to reup with a smaller inventory than I initially started with if I do this again... but I&#039;d much prefer for BTC to stabilize before I do so. Hopefully we can all weather this storm.

				Shipping: FAST. Ordered Thurs night, in transit Friday, in my mailbox on Monday. <br /><br />Stealth: Great. If the package were rip, and the product fall out, it wouldn&#039;t be obvious until going through several more layers.<br /><br />Product: Ho. Lee. Shit. My first roll ever. Come-up: fantastic. Plateau: phenomenal. Come-down: not bad. <br /><br />Took it at 6:10, noticed things started to get a little weird at around 6:50. Clamy palms, started rubbing my jeans, and they felt insane. My wife said my eyes got all big and I was just so happy about everything. It was fucking great. Only bad part is having to wait another few weeks before I can do it again. Feeling pretty good today, obviously tired, but in a good mood. No headache or anything. Would highly recommend, this stuff was phenomenal.

				Ordered 10g of MDMA from MollyExpress.&nbsp; Order was placed late on a Thursday night.&nbsp; The market value for Bitcoin wasn&#039;t doing so hot at the time either.&nbsp; I was a little bit worried that my order may get canceled, but I never messaged MollyExpress because he/she/they have been very active in their review forum.&nbsp; MExp has always seemed to be very upfront with info since I&#039;d been following them.&nbsp; Order was received the following Thursday.&nbsp; Packaging was impressive and much better than the other domestic US MDMA vendors I&#039;ve dealt.&nbsp; Vacuum sealed with mylar and some major creativity (my gf really like the creative surprise &quot;she says thanks ;)&quot; ).&nbsp; Product was spot on in weight.&nbsp; Reagent tested 3/3.&nbsp; Mecke straight blue-black with fizzing, Marquis straight black with fizzing, and Simons cobalt blue.&nbsp; Product was large grey shards.<br /><br />I figured I couldn&#039;t write a proper review today without a little nibble and had the afternoon to kill.&nbsp; I took a small sample of 100mg broken into 50mg doses spaced 15 min apart.&nbsp; The taste turned my tongue inside out ;)) and let me know this would be about 45 minutes before the effects would be felt.&nbsp; As with the higher quality MDMA I&#039;ve had the pleasure of consuming, it takes in the neighborhood of 30 to 45 minutes to catch up with you. So those of you new to higher quality be mindful it won&#039;t get you in 15 minutes like the street garbage cut with amphetamines.<br /><br />Trying to finish writing this with music now blasting. Mild eye flickers and sweaty palms letting.&nbsp; 45 minutes was pretty spot on.&nbsp; Have fun, great product. More than a great vendor to spend you money on.&nbsp; <br /><br />THANKS MOLLYEXPRESS

				I&#039;m still here and lurking, just taking a bit of a breather after the BTC drop. Seems like it&#039;s stabilizing again but my hope is that it doesn&#039;t go up too much too quickly. That&#039;s not good for any of us really. Slow steady gains is what I like to see.<br /><br />So far 110 transactions and not a single one didn&#039;t make it. And everybody has left 5/5. I am seriously in thanks to all of you for being such awesome customers. It is people like you that will make it all worthwhile if I decide to get back into the game.<br /><br />Stay tuned guys and keep checking in. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to get back in the game in no time.<br /><br />Happy Rolling in the meantime and enjoy your weekend!<br /><br />MollyExpress

				Howdy,<br />I came here because I saw that MollyExpress had posted on the DPR post that SR was down again, and saw that he sells MDMA domestially and wanted to see his reviews. They all appear to be stellar.&nbsp; I plan to buy when everything smooths out again. However, the reason that I am posting is that for some time, despite being logged in, I have not been able to post or reply to any topics except this one. I am wondering if anyone who is a mod or hero member can explain why. I have never been banned and I have 100% decent feedback, though currently that is unavailable because SR is down. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone know why I can only reply or post in this thread but not any others? Is it a forum DDoS issue? Thanks, and also I am trying to bump my posts to 50 for the next MollyExpress giveaway if that ever happens, which is problematic if the forum won&#039;t let me post or reply. In fact, if I go to another thread from this working thread it denies me the right to post or reply.&nbsp; Thanks. DrunkenAfficianado

They all appear to be stellar.&nbsp; I plan to buy when everything smooths out again. However, the reason that I am posting is that for some time, despite being logged in, I have not been able to post or reply to any topics except this one. I am wondering if anyone who is a mod or hero member can explain why. I have never been banned and I have 100% decent feedback, though currently that is unavailable because SR is down. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone know why I can only reply or post in this thread but not any others? Is it a forum DDoS issue? Thanks, and also I am trying to bump my posts to 50 for the next MollyExpress giveaway if that ever happens, which is problematic if the forum won&#039;t let me post or reply. In fact, if I go to another thread from this working thread it denies me the right to post or reply.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Update since I finally got to do some on a night out.&nbsp; Four of is us in all, all experiences users, rank it the best MDMA we&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; Three of us started with 150mg capsules and the gf with 110mg capsule.&nbsp; No re-up because it lasted well after the 3+ hour show.&nbsp; Onset was about 45 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;We all took our doses during a late night Jazzfest concert.&nbsp; Made for one hell of an evening.&nbsp; I felt very clear headed and euphoric the entire time.&nbsp; I spent a good bit of time with my eyes glitching unable to tell exactly where the musicians were on stage.&nbsp; One of our friends had a little trouble with jaw clench but everyone else seemed to fair okay.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be a helleva festival season with over 9g left.<br /><br />Come back soon because my friends keep asking where I got this magic from.&nbsp; All my old gear won&#039;t do ;) and I don&#039;t like to share.

				I read that you had mentioned something about &quot;if your buying 20g listings&quot;.&nbsp; Do you have a 20g listing available?<br /><br />Also, is this the quality people are referring to when they speak of &quot;Moon Rocks&quot;?<br /><br />Last, what weight do you consider a good dose?&nbsp; It can be down to the hundredth preferably

				Hi greenware, thanks for inquiring into my product. Unfortunately I do not have 20g listings available and unsure if I ever will to be honest with you. I personally feel more comfortable with the smaller listings and to be honest there are many other vendors who could offer 20g at a much more reasonable price than I could - my stuff comes straight from the chemist and it&#039;s very high quality, so I actually pay a premium and can&#039;t afford to sell my gear for 20g at a reasonable price and still be able to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Regarding your question about &quot;Moon Rocks&quot; - I would say moon rocks means a lot of things to a lot of people but in general what they are referring to are large sized crystals with little sand as the belief is that if it&#039;s a lot of crystals it&#039;s uncut with anything else. The truth is actually that even a powder could be cut with something and then re-rocked to form crystals so this idea that &quot;Moon Rocks&quot; are somehow better than powder is fallacious in my opinion.<br /><br />Having said that, when I get my gear from the chemist, it is largely mostly big chunks and crystals, but due to my stealth and shipping requirements, I do have to break it up a bit. Now, I try to keep as many pebbles and crystals intact, but in order to round it out to 1g or 5g or 10g, there is always going to be a little bit of sand and tiny rocks in there... it&#039;s good sand though I assure you!<br /><br />Regarding dose, I think this largely depends on your weight and tolerance, but for an average size man, I&#039;d say a good dose is anywhere from 125mg (on the very low end) to 170mg on the high end. 140mg seems to be the perfect dose for me personally.

				Placed first order on Friday and marked in transit by Sat. I am guessing it should be here this week. My question is about the crystals/powder. I have not taken MDMA since 2000 and only had the pills when doing them. Question - should I make it all powder and cap it or just mix it in some kind of juice and drink. Have years of experience with MDMA (florida breaks scene) but wife has none. Worried about straight into the system with her. Thoughts?<br /><br />I also saw your dose advice and I am glad I read it because I was thinking double that amount. Now I will start with 140.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />DAC

I do not recommend that, especially if this is your wife&#039;s first time.<br /><br />To be honest with you, I think it makes little difference whether you crush up into powder and cap or just parachute it (my preferred approach). Just take a little piece of kleenex and put some powder and some rocks in there, fold it up into a little ball and then down the hatch with your favorite beverage of choice. I know there is little evidence to support this but I do feel that the roll kicks in a little quicker in this manner vs. capsulizing, but that is just based on my experience.<br /><br />If the order was placed in transit on Saturday I fully expect it should be in your hands on Wednesday at the latest.<br /><br />Thanks so much for your order and your vote of confidence and I wish you and your wife a wonderful time together.<br /><br />Happy Rolling,<br /><br />ME

				COSO420, order with confidence bro.<br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about stealth speed or quality (which you should be), order from Molly Express and relax while your bomb ass shit comes to the address of your choice.<br /><br />As you can tell from my stats I&#039;ve listed below I&#039;ve been giving DPR and Silk Road quite a bit of currency (damn proud to support the black market!).<br /><br />My favorite substance to order off Silk Road is the MDMA because where I live everything is floaded with mythylone&nbsp; (&quot;molly&quot;BLEACHAHAHAHHHCH) and piperzine pills.&nbsp; I remember my good friend in NYC (who I could rely on to mail me a 20-40 pack of pills if I couldn&#039;t find any) telling me that she couldn&#039;t find any good pills so she and her friends switched to MDMA powder (Molly) because then they were assured a good roll. As time went on that was good but eventually the &quot;molly&quot; was no good. One year before a big festival we had spent over $300.00 on pills, powder, more pills, more powder... all of which turned out to be fake (thank god for testing kits). My friends and I had given up. We literally gave up on trying to find good pills/MDMA. We&#039;ve been partying/listening to electronic music since the mid to late 90&#039;s so you can imagine how upset we all were. Then along came silk road and venders like Molly Express.<br /><br />Bless you Molly Express, your MDMA is incredible as is your shipping, stealth, and prices!! <br /><br />Take it from ol Bill Paxton, don&#039;t think twice before ordering from this vender. <br /><br />-Bill Paxton

I know vendors can become overwhelmed, and I understand completely. My only thing is this; If it says on your vending page that you process all orders within 24 hours, that&#039;s what I would expect, otherwise, a message telling me you&#039;re busy would suffice. Not to mention, the page now says &quot;this user has no active listings&quot; That worries me. <br />Maybe I&#039;m just paranoid? Either way, I really wanted to roll this weekend with my fiancee.&nbsp; :-[

				Product Review - First the shipping was fast (4 days to a small town), the package was perfect and the communication was fast and friendly. Package weight was right on.<br /><br />The powder was awesome. Hadn&#039;t rolled in years and wife had never rolled ... the experience was perfect. We went the parachute route ... 150 for me (250 lbs) and 125 wife. We were flying by 25 minutes and blowing up in 40. We re-dosed at 75 each about an hour in and blew up for a couple hours. The come down was easier than I remembered and the next day was better than a hang over day.<br /><br />Thanks ME for the great experience. We will visit you again.<br /><br />DC

				Delivery(5/5): Ordered on Wednesday. Received on Friday. East Coast Love.<br /><br />Packaging(5/5): Good! Disguise is nice but nothing over the top. vac sealed and mbb as well.<br /><br />Quality(5/5): All rocks, shards, crystals. Took .1 and pupils were dilated and everything. Felt sedated but the euphoria was very faint. I&#039;ve tried .1 of other stuff and it honestly knocked me off my feet and euphoria out the butt. I can say that this is very clean though. Comedown was very light and smooth. My vision was going blurry often and felt good to rolls eyes back :P. Took at 6pm and rolled till 2/3am. Eyes were still dilated too. It smelled right and looked translucent, or off-white. <br />I only wish I had a stronger euphoric feeling. Maybe dose was too little. What do you guys think? Will try more this weekend.<br /><br />Communication(5/5): Quick and responsive. <br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll try in a bigger dose and hopefully that will do the trick. Overall, very nice vendor and it&#039;s quality stuff. I would recommend! I&#039;m really hoping the bigger dose will do the trick though! I&#039;m excited :D

				Hey guys,<br /><br />We are back from our vacation and we have a very large inventory in stock. I can&#039;t even begin to tell you how absolutely beautiful this latest batch is. It has been washed at least twice and has a strong sassafras smell with the nicest off-white color. Beautiful crystals and shards with a look that is very similar to cane sugar with a slightly lighter color.

				Guys, mollyexpress is the ONLY mdma vendor you need to go to. His goods are the best I&#039;ve ever tried here on the Road<br /><br />On his last batch, I was hesitant cause Ive never seen gray molly before. Damn did my worry turn to joy after my experience. I took 200mg. Started creeping up on me in 30min and completely blew up with happiness and euphoria an hour in. Took another 100mg an hour after I dropped, and peaks coincided at around 1hr45 min in. Pure energy and so so clean. Zero comedown, which is a huuuge benefit for me since my comedowns can sometimes become difficult to deal with. I swear the peak seemed to last forever, and I had to question at times if I was still rolling 3, 4 hours in.<br /><br />MollyExpress is the only guy I&#039;ll go to for molly now. No need to think of anyone else! His communcation is top notch, stealth is brilliant (his package WILL get to you), and product is insane. Every vendor should strive to be this guy, 10/5 in all aspects!<br /><br />Thank you for all the hard work you put in MollyExpress! Just ordered 5g from you, and cannot wait to try your new batch :)

I definitely can&#039;t compete with those prices...<br /><br />And yes while I agree there are also other cheaper domestic options, I recently had to increases my prices a little bit due to the double washing. Essentially, what you are getting with my product is a cleaner, more potent product due to this... so all in all, while there may be cheaper options gram for gram, if those other options have more impurities you are actually getting less than you paid for...<br /><br />The other thing that you get by ordering from me is order processing within 24 hours (on average, it&#039;s actually much less than that, sometimes as little as within just a few hours in fact), top notch stealth (ask anybody who has ordered from me - the postman could open up your package and never have a clue), very reliable service (of over 300 orders, I&#039;ve never lost a single one!), and a vendor who is responsive to your needs.<br /><br />As always, I will continue to see what I can do to further reduce prices and if my sales are impacted to a degree than I may have no other choice.

				I can couch for ME, his product is definitely very potent. Not to mention his stealth is some of the bet I&#039;ve seen.Worth the price IMO.Considering that most&nbsp; domestic &quot;molly&quot; on the streets isn&#039;t even MDMA, 60/g is well worth the price.You could easily get 100+ for his product.

				Hey guys, after some careful consideration, I just wanted to let you know I&#039;ve reduced my prices back to my original pricing, even though this batch is a far superior product with the double washing.<br /><br />For those of you who have ordered in the past few days, once the orders have finalized please message me and I will forward you back the associated coin so that you can also take advantage of the reduced pricing.<br /><br />Trust me folks, this batch is primo... it is guaranteed to knock your socks off :)<br /><br />

				Just did my first order with MollyExpress for (2) 5g packs. I&#039;ve only bought bulk MDMA from international vendors for the competitive pricing they offer, but in times of their vacation modes this vendor seems to be great for those in between times when you need product fast, and of high quality.<br />If his quality is better, then this will be my source for personal supply!<br /><br />Also, even on my first time, this vendor has given me A+ customer service that I can&#039;t stress enough.. I&#039;m more than impressed with his efforts to accommodate my personal needs that I had for this order.<br /><br />A+ to MollyExpress so far, and will return to update on shipping, stealth, and quality once I receive. Will put through full adulterant tester kit once I relieve as well.<br /><br />Looks like we have a top notch US vendor here!

				I actually ordered just before the 4th-of-July break, on a Sunday no less, and received my 5g on Wednesday.&nbsp; This report is regarding the previous batch (which looked just fine under 50x magnification), and if the new stuff is supposed to be more pure/potent than this felt, that&#039;s really saying something.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On a 70mg test dose (my first after many years), at T+0:35 I noticed that telltale shift in awareness, and by T+0:45 a very clean experience had begun, and the rest of the day was wonderful.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always enjoyed this substance being outside on nice days, with friends, etc. (I&#039;ve never done the rave thing, and anyway, on my first trip in 1987 there didn&#039;t seem to be that many around :-)&nbsp; So it felt quite genuine.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the future though, I must convince myself to stop at no more than a single dose (&lt;140mg).&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, excellent product (and stealth too as all have mentioned!) <br /><br />This new double-washed version is sounding a lot like the first MDMA I had ever tried, which was 26 years ago.&nbsp; How extremely magical and mystical that was...&nbsp; I could write pages and pages on that experience alone.&nbsp; Back then, I would take 140mg, and after one hour, I would even have the most interesting CEVs of 7-pointed star rolling-beads, intense déjà vu, nearly indescribable openness and acceptance, and after all that, a wonderful afterglow, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />But for now, I&#039;m hoping that with proper recovery using NAC, R-ALA, 5HTP, 2-AEP, Ubiquinol, Selenium and the like (I sort of over-did it after that initial &#039;test&#039; dose),&nbsp; and proper preloading (Vit C, Magnesium L-Threonate, maybe grapefruit juice) I&#039;ll continue to have wonderful experiences.<br /><br />After reading recent posts, I really want to try this latest batch.&nbsp; Is there any idea of the relative potency difference between the two?&nbsp; I wonder if most of those impurities would be inert to the experience - just needing a slightly higher dose - or if there&#039;s something more there than a simple dose adjustment would be able to account for?&nbsp; If&nbsp; the latter, then I can&#039;t wait until I can order again!<br /><br />Keep up the awesome work, MollyExpress!&nbsp; You&#039;ll have the rest of the world wanting to buy MDMA from the US instead of the reverse.<br />

				Review after relieve first 5g pack from ME:<br /><br />Shipping time: 10/10. Ordered Wednesday, here Friday to western US.<br /><br />Stealth:10/10. His stealth matches that of a bulk international MDMA supplier that I also go through. You can be confident to order this shit to your grandmothers house with your name on it.<br /><br />Communication: 10/10. Always replied in a timely, and professional manner. *Also to mention, this vendor provided me with superb customer service.. upon a request to make minor changes to my order after I had already processed (my mistake), he was completely willing to work with my needs. Was not expecting such attention for a new customer.<br /><br />Product: 10/10. The appearance is the best I have seen, and I did not expect to say that. See through pure white crystals. With such a small purchase, I was expecting crushed powder.. this was a pleasant surprise. Further, I put it through a full reagent test and it passed with flying colors, perhaps even better than what I get from over seas. Will update the product section once someone in my circle ingests the goods.<br /><br />Overall 10/10, couldn&#039;t ask more from a vendor, and would recommend his/her services to anyone under the sun.<br /><br />Thank you ME, for provided top notch service.<br /><br />Rrrop<br />

I definitely can&#039;t compete with those prices...<br /><br />And yes while I agree there are also other cheaper domestic options, I recently had to increases my prices a little bit due to the double washing.

				I had a chuckle today when I read the following feedback left by one of my customers:<br /><br />&quot;UPDATE: AMAZING QUALITY. BEST BATCH YET. Me and three friends took it at a big circuit party. One large male and two very petite Asian females. I took 310 mg like a decadent bitch, the straight dude took 280 and my fag hags took 160 and 160. We all rolled BALLS for hours. We redosed with 50% dose after 1.5 hours and the effects lasted past dawn. First drop and 12:20. We were in our hot tub at 7 a.m. and we all felt we were still rolling.&quot;<br /><br />Who doesn&#039;t love fag hags on Molly, especially when they are Asian :)<br /><br />Guys, if you haven&#039;t tried this latest batch, I can assure you it is really something special...

Never had a single package go missing or intercepted yet in over 400+ packages sent.

				Thank you everybody for all of your support and for being such loyal and awesome customers! We are excited to announce that we&#039;ve slowly crawled up the ranks and we are now in the top 12% of all vendors here on the road... we are very excited about the proposition of making it into the top 10% and have no doubt that it will happen soon with your continued support. Furthermore, our 5g listing is now the second most popular listing amongst the bestselling domestic MDMA...<br /><br />We couldn&#039;t have done this without all of you and I just wanted to take a quick moment to say thanks to all of you for this. We have been very blessed to have had such wonderful customers, and working with all of you has made being a vendor such a rewarding endeavor... sure the money is nice, but it&#039;s the fact that we get to put smiles on your faces when you open up that mailbox and find your little bit of heaven that is what really makes us happy.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Rest assured, all orders in the queue will be dropped in the mail prior to our break...

				Recently ordered from MollyExpress (First order off of SR ever!)&nbsp; Haven&#039;t received my package yet because of the shipping problem but I wanted to say a few important things I&#039;ve noticed about this vendor thus far.<br />Note: I recently moved into a new apartment and gave the correct name/address but the mailman did not recognize the name and did not deliver the package to its destination.&nbsp; This is no ones fault and ME is working on a resend/reship at the moment and I am very pleased with how this vendor conducts his business. <br />Edit: Also FE&#039;d because he has been providing me with great customer service thus far.<br /><br />Communication-5/5, This vendor will always respond to you within the day, very easy to communicate with.&nbsp; Very classy and understanding.<br /><br />Stealth and Speed- 5/5, Can&#039;t necessarily talk first hand experiences of stealth since I haven&#039;t received a package and opened it, but I can say that it was successfully shipped to my location within 3 days (Shipped Friday, Arrived Monday says the tracking ###).&nbsp; I know it was good stealth because it made it to my State and in the USPS Mailmans truck with no problem 8)<br /><br />Customer Service- 5/5, ME has put their best foot forward in many ways.&nbsp; Transactions are important (to any vendor, I can imagine) though ME goes the extra mile by making sure you are truly satisfied.&nbsp; He is always doing his best for the customers which is why I would recommend ME to any new/old buyers.&nbsp; He requires no FE and allows your BTC to remain in escrow.&nbsp; Very safe for new and old buyers alike!<br /><br />Product- Ordered 5 grams of MDMA for $300, one of the best prices on the road.&nbsp; Not yet received but will give a full review of the product once I get it (weight, appearance, reagent tests) and will update once I actually take it this upcoming Saturday at a Rave.&nbsp; Looking at the other reviews I already have a feeling that this product will be top of the line!<br /><br />TL;DR MollyExpress is the best US domestic vendor in many ways.

				Just wanted to add another product review of ME&#039;s latest batch.&nbsp; This stuff is straight FIRE.&nbsp; Me and a few friends used it for a two-day music festival/rave last weekend, and we&#039;re already ordering another 20 gram&#039;s ASAP.&nbsp; Seriously guys, this is ridiculously good product, and thats not even taking into consideration the amazing stealth and wonderful customer service.&nbsp; I asked a TON of stupid newb questions before my first order, and ME was more than willing to answer any question or concern I had.<br /><br />Day 1:&nbsp; I decided to try this stuff without any food in my stomach... BAD idea.&nbsp; I normally feel nausea while rolling, and not eating makes it worse, however I NEVER get sick.&nbsp; Ended up taking 110mg, and then another 70-80mg booster within around an hour time span.&nbsp; Halfway through _ set I got sick, but it was still one of the best rolls I&#039;ve had, and I still had an awesome fucking day afterwards.<br /><br />Day 2:&nbsp; Played it smarter and ate, so I can give a much better report from this day.<br /><br />3:30 PM : Chew up ~110 to 120mg with my lady friend, and head to see _.&nbsp; Within 30-45 minutes I am coming up HARD.&nbsp; _ is killing it, and I find myself unable to much other than stand there, smile, and bob my head.<br /><br />_ comes on next, and they are equally insane.&nbsp; I&#039;m peaking at this point, jaw clenched, and it feels like someone is just pouring euphoria all over me.&nbsp; <br /><br />6:00 PM : Drop another ~110 mg bomb.&nbsp; Head to catch the last little bit of _/get a good spot for _.&nbsp; Rolling absolute balls for all of _.&nbsp; At some points I have energy to jump around and go insane as _ is dropping some of the dirtiest trap I&#039;ve ever heard, and at others I had to simply stand in awe at how floored I was.<br /><br />8:00 PM: Drop&nbsp; another ~110mg bomb halfway through _.&nbsp; They finish and _ comes on right as this last capsule smacks me.&nbsp; He opens with a Get Lucky remix and I absolutely lose my mind.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I could have had a bigger grin on my face.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m ripping through cigs at this point, rolling my face off.<br /><br />10 PM:&nbsp; Take my last capsule ~70 mg (however, I would have been fine with another full point, I just wanted to make sure worst case scenario I could still drive).&nbsp; _ is playing an absolutely insane set.&nbsp; Spark up a joint with me and my girl, singing Clarity and Spectrum at the top of my lungs as we look into each others&#039; eyes.&nbsp; It was a magical and unforgettable feeling/set.<br /><br />After _ I catch the closing set of _, and reflect on the amazing day I just had.&nbsp; Still rolling as I get back to the hotel, I cuddle with my girlfriend and talk about how great the day was as we smoke more joints and take some bong loads.&nbsp; Still rolling long into the night, this product was AMAZING.<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t stress enough how much everyone really&nbsp; needs to get on the ME hype.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. it&#039;s important to note that I consider myself to have a decent enough tolerance to MDMA, and that I am completely aware of the health issues that come with dosing and redosing as I described.&nbsp; Just wanted to give an accurate report (:

				Hello all.&nbsp; First, a huge thank you to all the reviewers in this thread.&nbsp; You have made my decision of who to buy from far less of a burden (for a road noob that is).&nbsp; I did not want my first post in the forums to be in one of those &quot;spam to get 50 posts &quot; threads as i want to be a healthy contributor to the community from day one.&nbsp; So again, huge shout out to everyone who has taken the time to write a review of the support/shipping/product that ME is offering.&nbsp; It goes without saying, but i will say it anyway, that ME deserves thanks as well, even though i have not not ordered his product (i am slap broke right now, but start a new job soon!).&nbsp; I have been lurking the forums, trying to inform myself for a good while and this thread really stood out to me.&nbsp; I feel, in my noobness, that this is what the community should be about; seeing the interaction between ME and his customers has really put my mind at ease about ordering.<br /><br />I really cannot wait to try your product, ME!&nbsp; I am a fairly experienced user of street molly and am very excited to try a product that is only a step off from the chemist.&nbsp; While i have been totally moon-faced several times, i know that ive not had anything that was as pure as what you are offering. (last batch i had was pretty good, but my street dealer had crushed up a bean or two and added it in to the 2 grams of powder i bought). I am going to be saving my pennys and will be ordering after i catch up on a few bills.&nbsp; Assuming things go as smoothly as your other customer&#039;s experiences, you will have a repeat customer that understands and values the hard work it takes to pull off what you do here.&nbsp; I appreciate the thought and research that goes into providing this type of service.<br /><br />There was actually something else i wanted to cover, but my &quot;old man&quot; memory is failing me.&nbsp; It will come to me in a bit (probably right after i hit the Post button lol)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yep, i remember now what else i wanted to comment on.&nbsp; Pricing verses value of service and product.<br /><br />There were a few folks talking about ME&#039;s pricing vs other vendors.&nbsp; I have a background in sales and marketing, and i can say that if you offer a better product along with amazing service, you make it worth it to the customer to pay more money.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say that i am an artist and i charge $25 for a basic painting.&nbsp; If i go the extra mile and use a high quality paint that will always retain its vibrancy and captures the subject more vividly, the customer will usually see the value and will be willing to pay a premium. I remember seeing another thread talking about purity and how it effects price, and it seems to me that ME&#039;s success is direct proof that if you offer superior service that it is worth the small hike in price over other vendors.&nbsp; As backwards as it seems, if people pay more for a product/service, they often feel like they got what they paid for, especially if they understand what went into said product.&nbsp; Never sell yourself short! :)

				ME, can&#039;t wait for you to get listings back up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for a good domestic vendor who doesn&#039;t try to keep prices artificially low by sending out greater weight of less purity.&nbsp; From what I am reading, it&#039;s looking like I may have found my guy.&nbsp; Looking forward to you being my next purchase.

As quoted above, this was indeed our first roll and we weren&#039;t quite sure we were going to do it or wait for Tiesto two and a half months from now. SO SO glad we decided to dive in.. literally. <br /><br />So we were with a group of decently close friends, none of which do anything more than alcohol/adderal/weed, and we had rented a house on the river for a random 3 day weekend. Friend and I showed up Thursday night and only 6 other people came before our roll. We decided to not let anyone know what we were up to and do it during the day.. holy fuck, I&#039;m getting kind of amped just thinking about it! If you care to listen to what we had on rotation ---&gt; http://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/ OK:<br /><br />We took some vitamins, had an early breakfast, set up our floating devices and took 100mg each around 12:30 in the afternoon. I had already tested out the water temperatures earlier that day and it was a chilly mid ~60F. The sky was still a little overcast and decided we should throw the frisbee around and get our blood flowing. I swear I had inklings just 15 minutes into taking my capsule. Felt it in my arms and legs, like I had just had a body cast removed and I was standing on my own strength for the first time in months. Then just a steady stream of euphoria slowly washed over me, the music picked up, the sun came out and everything was perfect. I found a rock in the middle of the riverbed that let me stand waist deep and have an amazing view as it started to hit me. We had houses on one side covered in huge cypress trees and on the other a cliff that went up about 200ft. The sun hit and made everything glisten. I looked down and the river was completely still, we were the only two in it. Slowly moved my fingers across the surface and threw some on to her. She laughed like it was the first time I had ever made her laugh. I let my knees buckle and slowly went into the river. I slowly exhaled and listened to the bubbles come all around me and then after all my breath was gone the random music of the current. I came back up to the warm sun and inhaled to the fullest. I smiled and my friend and I knew that we had made the right choice. <br /><br />She stayed in her tube the entire time, I got out to get water and change the music a few times but we mostly enjoyed the water. Our friends joined us about 20 minutes into our onset and it was so good just talking and relaxing with them. AMAZING how much control you have on this stuff. About 2 hours into our roll I went up and rolled a joint (as I&#039;m leaving my friend smiles wide and says &quot;You are a fucking champion&quot;&nbsp; :) ) and that quelled the minor nausea she was having. I had a little jawclench but nothing intense.<br /><br />Reallly fantastic time. I can totally understand the comments I read about how MDMA is very energy/vibe dependent. Tiesto should be a completely different animal&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />If ME is talking down the stuff I had, I can&#039;t imagine what he&#039;s got in stock now. DO NOT HESITATE WITH ME. Thank you so much mollyexpress, I hope to come back as soon as I can. I might just order some before I run out of my current batch :P

I posted on page 18 earlier, this is my update and post-review.&nbsp; The weight was on-point (5 grams) and looked very good.&nbsp; It came in shards and stealth was nice :) The taste was bitter and overall the product was very classy.<br />Edit: Forgot to say it was shipped out Tuesday and arrived Friday.<br />A couple friends (3 girls, 3 guys) and I went to a rave this past weekend and we decided to take ME&#039;s batch.&nbsp; Throughout the night: 2 girls (first time rolling/first rave) took 100 mg and a 50 mg redose, 1 girl took 450 mg, DudeFriend and I took 400mg, another dude took 300 mg. This stuff is straight FIRE.&nbsp; The best molly I have ever taken in my life!<br /><br />This is a review from all my friends.&nbsp; We loved it!<br />(Everyone only ate breakfast that day, drank Gatorade and took muilti-vitamins)<br />5:30pm: 3 Guys dropped 100mg.<br />6pm: We start feeling it, everyone is excited for the rave. Left the hotel.<br />6:30pm: Arrive at the rave, we are rolling pretty good! Jaw clenched, pupils dilated, grinning (we call this cheese-ing lol) and feeling really good.&nbsp; The feeling is very euphoric, good body high as well. 2 girls drop their 100 mg, other girl drops 200mg, the 3 guys take another 100mg each<br />7pm: We are raging! Everyone is having a great time.&nbsp; The girls start feeling it, the guys are definitely rolling. <br />7:30pm: I drop another 100mg (I was very excited, I wish I had spaced it out more), met up with my ex-girlfriend and give her 100mg.<br />8pm: I&#039;m completely blasted, really really enjoying the night.&nbsp; Eyes are all over the place, the music is fantastic, body high is unreal! The feeling was very clean.&nbsp; Top of the line stuff right here.&nbsp; My ex was feeling it too (she never rolls, tried it 3 times and never really liked it) but told me that these were awesome and that she was feeling fantastic! :)<br />~9pm: Girls drop their 50mg redose, other girl drops 100mg, 2 guy friends drop their 100mg.&nbsp; I am in heaven at this point in time!&nbsp; We all go to the front of the stage and everyone is enjoying themselves.<br />~10pm: Having so much fun, everyone said I looked fucked up though lol.&nbsp; My other friends were having a blast as well, everyone was hydrating and watching out for each other.&nbsp; Good vibes all around.<br />~12am: Me and girlfriend go back to the hotel ;) I take another 100mg when I get there. (Left before the headliner)<br />~3am: Group comes back (with a bunch of friends too) and tells us how much fun they had, most of them take another point.&nbsp; <br />4am: I started coming down, other people are rolling and EVERYONE is saying these are superb mollys. A lot of them are saying its the best they&#039;ve taken in their lives / in a long time.<br />5am: I fell asleep comfortably, every one else stayed up to talk/dance/chill.<br /><br />The next day I was exhausted (I had to work early in the morning the day of the rave) and I woke up at 9am the next day to help clean the hotel.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t feel any side effects besides being slightly sluggish (probably from lacking proper rest).&nbsp; Everyone was thanking me for grabbing these but the real shout out goes to MollyExpress.&nbsp; Thank you!!<br /><br />Overall:<br />Customer Service: 5/5<br />Product: 5/5<br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Communication: 5/5<br />Customer Satisfaction: 10/5<br />

				A little confused..<br /><br />I keep reading all the reviews about a crystal clear MDMA, but the listings show a brown/tan MDMA.<br /><br />Is this the same batch everyone is raving about or is this a different batch?<br /><br />Would like to try to crystal clear everyone is talking about?<br /><br />Thanks

Shipping and everything was clutch, tested via marquis (just to be safe) and am just now waiting on the right time :) <br /><br />Just wanted to say thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are very welcome! Please do stop on by and let us know how it goes when you do find the time to actually try the product out. And while I know the last batch you got was good, man I wish you could try this latest batch... it&#039;s totally out of control.<br /><br />Namaste!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First report I&#039;ve written in a while but damn, I feel like I&#039;d be doing anyone who is hesitating to pick up from ME. As quoted above, this was indeed our first roll and we weren&#039;t quite sure we were going to do it or wait for Tiesto two and a half months from now. SO SO glad we decided to dive in.. literally. <br /><br />So we were with a group of decently close friends, none of which do anything more than alcohol/adderal/weed, and we had rented a house on the river for a random 3 day weekend. Friend and I showed up Thursday night and only 6 other people came before our roll. We decided to not let anyone know what we were up to and do it during the day.. holy fuck, I&#039;m getting kind of amped just thinking about it! If you care to listen to what we had on rotation ---&gt; http://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/ OK:<br /><br />We took some vitamins, had an early breakfast, set up our floating devices and took 100mg each around 12:30 in the afternoon. I had already tested out the water temperatures earlier that day and it was a chilly mid ~60F. The sky was still a little overcast and decided we should throw the frisbee around and get our blood flowing. I swear I had inklings just 15 minutes into taking my capsule. Felt it in my arms and legs, like I had just had a body cast removed and I was standing on my own strength for the first time in months. Then just a steady stream of euphoria slowly washed over me, the music picked up, the sun came out and everything was perfect. I found a rock in the middle of the riverbed that let me stand waist deep and have an amazing view as it started to hit me. We had houses on one side covered in huge cypress trees and on the other a cliff that went up about 200ft. The sun hit and made everything glisten. I looked down and the river was completely still, we were the only two in it. Slowly moved my fingers across the surface and threw some on to her. She laughed like it was the first time I had ever made her laugh. I let my knees buckle and slowly went into the river. I slowly exhaled and listened to the bubbles come all around me and then after all my breath was gone the random music of the current. I came back up to the warm sun and inhaled to the fullest. I smiled and my friend and I knew that we had made the right choice. <br /><br />She stayed in her tube the entire time, I got out to get water and change the music a few times but we mostly enjoyed the water. Our friends joined us about 20 minutes into our onset and it was so good just talking and relaxing with them. AMAZING how much control you have on this stuff. About 2 hours into our roll I went up and rolled a joint (as I&#039;m leaving my friend smiles wide and says &quot;You are a fucking champion&quot;&nbsp; :) ) and that quelled the minor nausea she was having. I had a little jawclench but nothing intense.<br /><br />Reallly fantastic time. I can totally understand the comments I read about how MDMA is very energy/vibe dependent. Tiesto should be a completely different animal&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />If ME is talking down the stuff I had, I can&#039;t imagine what he&#039;s got in stock now. DO NOT HESITATE WITH ME. Thank you so much mollyexpress, I hope to come back as soon as I can. I might just order some before I run out of my current batch :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow... what a nice review. You are a fantastic writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this! :) Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us an impression of your experience. It sounds like you had a lovely time, and it brings me great happiness to know I am playing a small part to help you bring some joy into your lives.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />ME

				Passed the reagent test with flying colors.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried yet, but I have tested from every batch I&#039;ve tried for the last two years, and this one was easily the best reaction I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; I had a great pokeball from back in the day that I used as my control to make sure the test kit was still good - will be saving a little bit of this as my new control - purest I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; Shipping was fast, stealth was great, everything went better than I could have imagined.&nbsp; Can&#039;t comment on the quality of the roll yet (waiting for an upcoming festival), but I&#039;m not worried about it at all.&nbsp; 95% nice crystal shards, maybe 5% powder, looks washed, very impressed with it so far.&nbsp; I will (hopefully remember to) update this after I&#039;ve consumed.&nbsp; This was my first SR order and I am stoked, especially after all of the &quot;molly&quot; I&#039;ve tested in the last month that came tested as Methylone.&nbsp; This is the real deal.

				Received my order in 3 days, couldn&#039;t ask for faster than that!&nbsp; Stealth was perfect as well.&nbsp; I too reagent tested the shipment and the reaction was exactly what it was supposed to be.&nbsp; Cannot wait to try the product, and hopefully ME takes whatever time he needs to deal with his family matters and comes back to us soon! Don&#039;t particularly feel like ordering from anyone else.

				I want to change a review that I had, but with the new changes am not able to edit my review:<br /><br />I ordered MDMA from Haizenberg. He was very professional, but the product was processing for over 10 days. And after a month of it not coming in the mail, I thought he just hadn&#039;t sent any.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised a little over a month later to receive it! <br />The smell was different, so I tested&nbsp; it on two reagants kits. And it was straight to black.<br /><br />Tried it tonight, we were all more than impressed. We all ended up rolling very hard, and it was a great clean roll.<br />So, I apologize for the premature accusation, Haisenberg. I still gave you a 5/5 if that helps.<br />I recommend the stuff highly!

				It&#039;s relieving to see how prompt you were to the message! Sheep is growing and it&#039;s design is pretty slick. As of now bmr is trying to handle the overload as it also closed registrations so it&#039;s sort of difficult to hop onto that as of the moment. If you can, I&#039;d like to stay in contact with you through torchat if possible (seems much more reliable). I&#039;ve seen a lot of the vendors I&#039;ve was going to on sheep and it looks like they migrated well. It will be difficult to build credibility on it though with all the chaos going on.<br /><br />But yeah, would it be possible for you to use torchat me?

				Many of the big name vendors have made accounts on both BMR and Sheep as trials to see which runs more effectively..others are waiting for the dust to settle before making moves. Lots of threads/polls open discussing where the majority of SR customer and vendor base will go but it seems pretty split at the moment. Each alternative has pros and cons. <br /><br />I&#039;m not decided one way or the other, but I know for sure I won&#039;t buy from anyone but ME or Aidoneus. Everyone should also take the precaution of not buying from a &quot;vendor&quot; claiming to be a big name from SR unless they themselves post a link to their account on these forums, no other way to know if it&#039;s a scammer taking advantage of such vendors&#039; great standing reputation.
