				Ok things are completely messed up now.<br /><br />Can somebody respond to this message? Can not post it in the right subforum because of newie rules. Respond to it there then.<br /><br />ketamine + dried speed or otherwise as good as dried = this chemical reaction and somebody dying from snorting both (probably) so that reaction took place in his nostrils?

				wish i could help but im no chemist. i say try other drug forums (some clearnet ones). Also did chemicals go up nose before they&#039;re were mixed or afterwards cuz if you mix drugs and they start to smoke and bubble i wouldn&#039;t put that in me at all. I &#039;ve mixed ketamine with mdma&nbsp; which is an amphetamine but not methamphetamine and I had no problems except watery colors and jello legs<br />also was it from the road or off the street cuz you should message ur vendor if off the road

				Yes it was our friends own decision to mix these two and ingest same route at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone out here who has some ketamine and amfetamines could mix just a few mgs to see if this reaction takes place. Small effort, ultimately helpful.<br /><br />Yes we can do all sorts of other stuff to figure this out ourselves, but we fear the worst so we would feel better when getting answers immediately. It will also help if different kinds of ketamine and amphetamines are used, dry and wet/medium and ultra wet. Or just ketamine with the liquid that their speed has been shipped with. Then we have different stories and can come to a conclusion.<br />Doing this ourselves will take a lot of time and effort and we can not afford to get new drugs at all because we must keep a secure low profile and we are not sure if we know enough about how to do that.<br />We do not even have time to deal with the loss of our dear friend yet. And asking for help on SR already takes up time. We use one account and let one person do this because we think it&#039;s best. We do talk in we because WE are friends and WE were going to have a nice time either with some probably good speed or ket, or look up first if usage at the same time is always lethal, or just not recommended.<br />In our experience almost all drugs can be mixed (while it is not healthy, it will not lead to immediate death). <br /><br />

				Dont know cant ask anymore. Probably because of the idea of NOT passing out because of the speed, even higher moodlift and intense trip?<br />Asking this is simply stupid. Like you even care. Somebody died, because of an SR vendor. Perhaps some day it might be you.<br /><br />lucas1313 any arguments or you just presenting proof that you are a careless sick bastard?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Other than your friend being dead, it doesn&#039;t sound like you have any clue as to what&#039;s going on. You can&#039;t just blame an SR&nbsp; vendor until you know why the fuck your friend died. People die from taking aspirin, let alone from using illegal drugs they have little experience with. It sucks that your friend is dead, but don&#039;t you think he or she may have some responsibility in their own death? I am just asking a fucking question here. Until your friend is checked out by a medical examiner you shouldn&#039;t assume anything. If you use drugs then you have some responsibility if something bad happens. The same is true for doing all pleasurable but potentially dangerous fucking shit, many of which are legal and drugs are not even involved. Take responsibility for your life and don&#039;t be a victim because fucked up shit goes on all the time!
