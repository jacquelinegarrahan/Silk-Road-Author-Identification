				looking for information on steroids<br />i am around 6&#039; tall and weigh between 160-190 depending on factors, but have very little muscle mass. <br />im not looking to get huge or ripped but am looking to get a solid build going on. <br />i know absolutely nothing about steroids, growth hormones or anything like that, so I am just looking for information on where to start<br />looking for a 3-4 month program, trying to avoid the negative side-effects as well. <br />i remember seeing some vendors on here had a steroid pack where they gave you advice on how to use it and whatnot but cant find anything like that anymore<br />looking to spend hopefully no more than $500 altogether<br />any advice would be helpful

				You will get the best long-term effect using supplements allowing to increase the body weight first (to put on weight). Next I recommend the centre named METANABOL. he will let you get the fine sculpture for the long time and won&#039;t inflate with water. 90 pills are a cost about USD 400 in Europe.<br /><br />CHERRS

				Steroids will not help you if you don&#039;t even lift. <br /><br />If you have to ask, what steroids, where to buy, how to use etc you should not be taking them<br /><br />You need foundations = years of training, dieting/nutrition, experience etc

				Eat 500 calories above your maintenance calorie level, lift heavy weight and eat a gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight you have. <br /><br />As you get bigger, adjust calories properly.<br /><br />Sleep for 8+ hours a night, and you wont be needing any steroids for at least 3 years.

				Exactly, if u dont lift, dont need steroids.<br /><br />6 Months alone would be a transform, drug free.<br /><br />BUT, i know your not gonna listen, so make sure you read up on everything u can find.<br /><br />Diet is more important then the gear.<br /><br />Test is always needed on cycle, running a cycle without test shuts your sex drive down.<br /><br />The compounds all depend on your goals...do you want to get big? Strong? Stay same size but get strong? etc.<br /><br />My bulking (growing) cycle is usually, Testosterone 400 (Mix of Test Cyp and Test E), NPP (quicker form of Deca) with Dbol or Tbol jumstarting the cycle and Then running Winny end of the cycle.<br /><br />PM me for more info, but be smart and safe and read up on this shit for MONTHS. Propper training and diet are essential to keeping your gains.

				Aren&#039;t you guys worried by the fact that Steroids make you impotent and prone to extreme mood swings? <br /><br />That is after all the other negative consequences.<br />For a while I had a crunch on bodybuilders, until I found out that their most important muscle lay dwarflike and dormant in their pants.<br />Big man = mini dick is not my equation.<br />

				Please do not waste money on steroids if you do not even lift. Steroids are for someone who has reached a plateau in their lifting regime and absolutely need help to get over it.<br /><br />Lift and diet properly for a few years before you even consider steroids&nbsp;

				I think you should have at least a year of lifting experience before you even consider steroids. You could really have some nice gains without resorting to steroids; they just seem like overkill (assuming you&#039;re just starting off).

				I&#039;m about to start my first steroid cycle after a year of going to the gym. I started out with no natural muscle whatsoever, and it&#039;s amazing the gains that can be achieved by simply scoffing your face and going to the gym 5-7 times a week. Eat plenty of egg whites, George Foreman your meat, cut out almost all carbs apart from pasta, rice and a few others (avoid crisps, chips, white bread at all costs) which are good for bulking. Also, buy a &#039;weight gainer&#039; tub of protein. <br /><br />If you MUST get on steroids, you have to first remember that you will keep very few of your gains after you get off the roids. Start by taking some Anadrol (oxymetholone) and/or some dbol (1 50 pill a day) every day for about 4-6 weeks. Then in your post cycle take some testosterone and gradually take less and less until you take none.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t bother though until you have a platform to go off.

				had to say something. please make sure you use steroids properly. one my mates died from a sever heart attack cause he wasnt using beta blockers which is the speculation. but use them with care. they can fuck u up. natural builds take longer but are worth the time and looks much better then some one s over shotted himself with steds. try it the natural way first.
