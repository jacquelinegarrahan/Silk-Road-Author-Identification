				Is this normal for your deliveries?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had friends that their mailman drives their own car, but if it&#039;s just random that&#039;s pretty weird.

				No, our neighborhood route is by foot, the dude parks at the end of the street and walks around the block, then moves to the next one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just don&#039;t know if I should be concerned or not.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a significant order, I thought maybe it could be the vendor&#039;s person or something...But I haven&#039;t heard from them.&nbsp; I thought it was strange

				Some mail delivery in my area is by just normal civilian vehicles, and express is by someone else too. My mail carrier seems to change at least a couple of times a week, but this was normal before I ever used SR or it probably would have freaked me out.<br /><br />Once YEARS ago I had some a completely legal package delivered fairly late at night by a guy in what looked like a Uhaul van, it was addressed correctly and had postage. Just weird.

				I have had this happen with express and international packages.<br /><br />Sometimes the regular mailman drops them, other times it is a postal employee in their own car. I think this happens depending on when the pack reaches the post office, since express and international are time sensitive sometimes they come seperately so that they can be delivered quickly.
