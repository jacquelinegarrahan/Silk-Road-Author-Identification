				I started my first account this past week, put in some money, placed a small order and now I CANNOT LOG BACK IN! It didn&#039;t happen immediately. Problem just started this morning. Emailed support with this new ID, but so worried that was hacked or something. <br />I created a new ID and logged in to email support with that one, so I know that it is not about having the wrong address or something. I have the passphrase written down so I know that it is not incorrect either. Have been trying to re-login all day and no cigar.

				Have you ever been to a login site that asks for your pin?<br /><br />How do you access SR? Do you keep it in your bookmarks?&nbsp; Did you try to access SR from any other computers?

				I believe the SR address has been the same since its deployment in 2011.<br /><br />If you went to any site other than http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ and it looked like the SR login site asking for your pin, then you were at a phishing site.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which is basically a site modeled to look like SR designed to steal your username, password, and pin.&nbsp; The phisher would then get your account, drain it of btc and do whatever else with it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think SR support will help because warnings about this are everywhere.&nbsp; They will probably just direct you to the wiki.&nbsp; Just make sure you know now that SR would never ask for your pin outside of placing an order or transferring coin.

You&#039;ll have to wait until SR Support replies to you and resets your passphrase, then you&#039;ll have to log in and reset your PIN. Any BTC that you had in your account will likely have been withdrawn by the phishers.<br /><br />Silk Road will NEVER ask you for your PIN, other than when you&#039;re buying something on the &#039;Cart&#039; page.<br /><br />@DoctorFate - good catch, +1!<br /><br />Libertas
