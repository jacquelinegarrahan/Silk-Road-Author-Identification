				Spent $120 on some ice from ayeseadee1080 because up to this point he seemed to be the only guy who had meth different from anyone else. I liked the meth he sold because it was cut with MSM and a quick acetone wash got rid of all the bullshit. I place another $120 express order and 3 days later&nbsp; I get a order in from The dope spot and a order in from ayeseadee1080 at the same time. I first look at DTS and notice that it was one big shard with side ways gooves alot like a large fork scraped it. I have seen ton&#039;s of meth and this was a very first seeing this type of groove cut.<br /><br />I then open my order from ayeseadee1080. I shake my head, &quot;no way, not the same&quot; and I run inside to place it under a magnifying glass and bright lamp. I do everything in my fucking power to find something different from the other. After forgeting which shard belonged to ayeseadee1080 I came to the sudden realization I had just spent $120 on an extra gram from&nbsp; the dope spot.
