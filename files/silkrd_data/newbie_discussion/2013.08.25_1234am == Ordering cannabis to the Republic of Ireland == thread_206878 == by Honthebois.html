				I am planning to order 1-2 packages of weed (about 50-100 grams) per week to a student house in Ireland. There will be several people living in this house, non of whom will be involved apart from one who is taking the packages for me, although they are all smokers and do not mind these packages arriving at the house. Before I do this so as to be as secure as possible, I want to clear up these security issues:<br />1 - Should I buy a PO box instead? I can&#039;t find an conclusive answer relating to Ireland in these forums. The money isn&#039;t a problem, I&#039;m just thinking about whatever will lower the risk<br />2 - Is it safe to keep any illegal substances in the house that the packages are being delivered to?<br />3 - Should I take any extra measures to ensure the anonymity of the bitcoin transaction? I have read about Bitcoin Fog but it all seems a bit complicated and I am only bothered with it if it will actually improve the safety of the purchase.<br />4 - The domestic prices seem very high where as UK prices are fantastic... should I stay safe and buy domestic or is it worth the money saved buying abroad?<br />5 - The house in question doesn&#039;t have a mailbox but there will almost always be someone in the house ready to take a package. Should I use a fake name on the package, and will they have to sign for it when it comes to the door?<br />6 - Would the guards be in any position to search the house that the packages are being delivered to/the people living in that house if a package is discovered in customs?

				those amounts will get you a controlled delivery not a letter. ire has pretty tough customs, second to aussies for moaning about customs getting their drugs lol. if i were you i&#039;d stick to domestic until you can sort a safer, more anonymous drop. those student drug users setting off alarm bells.

				if your order is intercepted by customs sometimes they use undercovers to deliver it then arrest the person to sign for it and search the house etc

				Would buying several smaller packages a week instead of one big package reduce the risk of this? And if so, how small should I go? (3.5g, 7g, 14g etc)

				it really depends on your personal circumstances whether that would be wise or not. you don&#039;t want to have multiple orders in transit to the same address and such like.. imo you should be able to argue personal on amounts up to an oz in court but it&#039;s still importing. with that frequency of orders you&#039;d want some different addresses and they should all be clean. have a really good read of relevant threads in the shipping and security sections here.
