				Factor in quality, price, shipping time, stealth, experience, response time and whatever other factor you can think of that makes that vendor in your opinion #1! <br /><br />GO!!<br />&nbsp;8) 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />So far my best experience was with DutchTrade! too bad he left a couple weeks ago. man i miss that dude. and his product. lol

				I was thinking about going with him, just sucks that the fact it is supposed that it arrives as dust :( i like mine better in smaller rocks and chunks as opposed to dust as s/he mentions.<br />thats who i&#039;ll probably go with next. idk. Just ordered from CDN and hoping all goes well with his. :)<br />

				I have tried a few vendors for MDMA and MDA.<br /><br />For MDMA, my favorite in terms of delivery time to the US with still great quality and top notch stealth has been NewAmerica.&nbsp; If you are willing to spend a little more, DReaMensioN has some of the highest purity MDMA and MDA that I have ever seen or done.&nbsp; It is definitely not cheap, and it may take about 7-10 days depending on where you are, but it is well worth it.<br /><br />If you are looking outside the US and a more reasonable pricing, FartBomber is offering killer deals on good stuff.<br /><br />Happy hunting, there is so much good shit out there that it is overwhelming sometimes!
