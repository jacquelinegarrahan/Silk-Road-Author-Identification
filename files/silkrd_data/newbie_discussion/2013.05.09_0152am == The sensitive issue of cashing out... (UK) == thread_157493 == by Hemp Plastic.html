				Hey, I&#039;ve just made another forum account to ask about cashing out. I&#039;ve been scanning the forum for some answers. I&#039;m only a small vendor so I don&#039;t need to consider shell companies et cetera, but I do need a solid way to cash out and I don&#039;t have the money to get scammed trying to find out (to be honest who does?).<br />I&#039;m already on LocalBitcions but I&#039;m not getting any business due to lack of feedback.<br />I&#039;d love to keep it in the family by giving my business to an SR vendor so here are two my options are:<br /><br />Cash in mail - at the moment bitcoin seems to be the only vendor offering this and due to his name is hard to find info on him on the forum although he has high stats he only has one feedback for that item so I can only assume only one person has used it. Yesterday when I checked Mr. Cronk was offering a similar service but he seems to have taken it down.<br /><br />Prepaid/debit cards - Quite a few vendors selling these, couple I&#039;ve looked at are DrugsAndCash, Butch1200 and Yavanor. Just wondering how I get my coins on to it? Do I have to start selling my coins on the road for Ukash or transfers? Can you even load Ukash on to it? I doubt that&#039;s the case otherwise they&#039;d be more Vendors selling bitcoins on the road. I don&#039;t really need to know the exact method, as the vendors offer this info once the card has be purchased, but I would like to know if this is a good method of cashing out...<br /><br />DRGONZO offers to buy btcs through western union or Moneygram.<br /><br />The only other method I could think of is bitcoin-otc, I heard you can sell with the CIM method, but the stuff I&#039;ve read on bitcoin-otc make it seem over complicated and not understanding it would up the chances of getting scammed.<br /><br />It just feels like I&#039;m missing some obvious. Can anyone help?

				I forget the vendors name but someone was offering to load green dot cards with money that you could cash out. I think it was in the money section. Don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a good method but it&#039;d certainly be better than using stolen cards etc. From what I read it also sounds pretty secure as the vendor can&#039;t remove the funds once you finalize plus whatever benefits green dot has. I&#039;d read up on it for sure though.

				If you want to trade BTC for cash in the UK I would be willing to work with you but we will have to do something to establish trust first. PM me or post back on here and maybe we can sort something out.<br /><br />See, your problem is the reverse of mine. I wish to get money IN anonymously whereas you are looking to get money OUT so I would love to work something out with you as atm my cash &gt; BTC transactions are all fully in the clear.<br /><br />Britfag

				That&#039;s the thing I&#039;ve seen lots of buyers on here looking for bitcoins, but it&#039;s hard to sell bitcoins without giving up my anonymity to some degree (western union, moneygram, cash in the mail, bank transfer), which would make using bitcoins in the first place pointless.<br /><br />@britfaglulz2 I&#039;m interested in this but how are we going to prove to each other that we&#039;re not the fuzz? How are we going to do the transfer of physical cash, face-to-face makes me kind of uneasy, cash in the mail to one of my safe houses? I don&#039;t know it&#039;s a lot to work out.<br /><br />@codyqueen I&#039;ve looked at them before, but their seller page says:<br />&quot;We would love to have you on board, provided that you are a trusted, honest and reliable person with a legal source of bitcoins to sell. To be approved as a seller on BitBargain, you need to verify your details (e-mail, phone, bank account, ID),&quot;<br />kind of puts me off.<br /><br />@sharliecheen2 Were you buying or selling bitcoins from/to &#039;bitcoin&#039;?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking into Ukash, but it&#039;s hard finding info. Can you load those polish cards being sold on the road with it?<br />I just want to know how you load them before I splash out on one...

				Hi,<br /><br />I would suggest we chat on Skype, and proves ourselves to each other. BTW trading in BTC IS NOT ILLEGAL is it now? So there are no worries there.<br /><br />We can chat on skype and each trade some info to verify and basically use our &quot;gut feeling&quot; as to whether or not to proceed with any deal. If I trusted you enough I would do bank transfer, depending on the amount. We could break up the transaction into smaller chunks or whatever.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know... Like I said we would need to talk and discuss at length and then sort out some kind of anonymous method. Where there is a will there is a way. And once we have built up a certain level of trust things will become easier. I would prefer to work with someone on a regular basis anyway for this sort of thing as building up trust is hard.<br /><br />If you are interested in discussing some options, drop me a line back and I will send you my skype or whatever you&#039;re comfy with and we can have a chat. BTW what sort of figures are we talking? I would probably be interested in £500 worth at a time in chunks of £100 or whatever.<br /><br />Anyway.... Too many variables, like I said we will need to discuss to see how we feel about each other.<br /><br />Look forward to hearing from you...<br /><br />Britfag

If I could get a card I could load with Ukash it&#039;d make selling btc anonymously easier for both parties, and if the coins could be put into escrow it&#039;d increase the safety.<br /><br />brainfreeze I&#039;ll send you one later today.

If we can work out an escrow situation and start with a ton that would be ideal.<br /><br />I&#039;ll only need about 400 quid worth total though, enough to get a vendor account set up here plus pay for some other services.

				Guys for anyone considering trades outside of SR using real currency please don&#039;t do it, it&#039;s a bad idea.&nbsp; Not only for your own safety but it is also against seller guidelines for SR.&nbsp; Vendors can lose their privileges and others can possibly be denied becoming a vendor.&nbsp; In the end it&#039;s your choice obviously but I&#039;d be more concerned about the other party being LE more than anything else.&nbsp; For this reason SR has rules in place to protect us.&nbsp; <br /><br />More information can be found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide

I put the name of the bank in the &quot;name&quot; box and it went through. I have no idea if this is standard or not though. I suspect some banks won&#039;t like it.<br /><br /><br />I guess there must be something sensitive about cashing out secrets, something that is too many ppl know it would get blown.<br /><br />Good luck with your research.

Its not illegal to sell BTC on SR. But if its tied to your vendor account selling illicit substances, that&#039;s just asking for trouble.

				@chinacat101 I&#039;m not looking for buyers on here, I&#039;m looking for methods. If the methods are anonymous it wouldn&#039;t matter if it was my drug vendor account. Like SEPA-&gt;Anonymous prepaid card or Ukash-&gt;something<br /><br />@londonpride2 JotR guides are a bit out of my price range plus to do that advance one on cashing out you&#039;ve got to do the beginner one first.<br /><br />@android465764E You&#039;ve got to register for bitbargain.
