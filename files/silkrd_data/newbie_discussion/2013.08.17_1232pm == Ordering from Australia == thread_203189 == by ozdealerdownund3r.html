				Hi,<br /><br />So I wanted to put my thoughts down on how it has been ordering from Australia. As most are aware, our customs are pretty tight. So getting anything in or out of the country is difficult. What makes it worse is that we have the highest prices in the world and have the most country hops from origin to destination. This means we pay the most for stuff which is cut back significantly.<br /><br />Since jumping on SR I have made a few sample orders from the US, UK and Netherlands and so far no mail has gone missing however there are some now which are taking what seems like forever.<br /><br />The quality has been fantastic on everything I have delivered and in our market have grabbed everything for a bargain.<br /><br />Finding bulk suppliers is hard though. It seems like the most people are willing to send per delivery is 25g if not 14g. (There has been an exception). So getting large supplies here is difficult. I think there needs to be a market for sales in the range of 100g-1000g. I have already asked the 3 vendors I have bought from and they either can&#039;t supply the amount of don&#039;t offer wholesale.<br /><br />Overall I am quite happy with the whole SR experience and dealing with reputable vendors make the experience enjoyable.<br /><br />I have loaded up significant number of bitcoins and looking for a few bulk vendors so PM me. I am interested in <br />1. Your customer feedback<br />2. Speed in getting deliveries here (currently Budwork UK has that down pat with 4 days)<br />3. Quality of product <br />4. Price<br /><br />In that order :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading and be safe.

				I can&#039;t imagine that vendors sift through the forums looking for work? Could be wrong though...<br /><br />What substance are you talking about?<br /><br />Have you gone onto the main SR site and then clicked on the substance that you are looking for and then contacting vendors who supply bulk?<br /><br />From my understanding, when dealing with bulk orders, vendors like buyers to have spent alot of BTC prior to making an order, so that they can see you have a good track record.... BUT, we all have to start somewhere...<br /><br />Good luck!

				Hi<br />I imagine most vendors don&#039;t want to offer bulk amounts to Australia&nbsp; unless you F.E which inadvisable in most cases. If you find a vendor who&#039;s willing to split larger orders into several packages and you get several drops it might be possible to get larger orders in regularly. Good luck anyway.<br /><br />FelixUK

Any Vendor can ship any amount to Australia but in the event it gets caught ( and the risks are considerable higher compared to other countries ) what then? If the Australian buyers would guarantee they give 5/5 regardless if the package gets stuck or not I would imagine most Vendors would treat Australia no differently than any other country. The reality is probably a lot of Australian buyers get their packages seized and then complain on the Vendor, thus making them reluctant to take any risks with them as they&#039;re more trouble than they&#039;re worth.<br /><br />When I get started with Mail Forwarding the risks will be in reverse - if I get the packages in I will theoretically have the possibility of shipping them Domestically without any risk as they&#039;ve already made it. If the package gets seized the money is lost and depending on the amount there&#039;s a very high risk the Account and Identity for that specific Mail Forwarder gets permanently burnt. If it&#039;s viable to do this on a larger scale or not remains to be seen.&nbsp; :P

You have to look for them. The amounts you&#039;re talking about, 100g - 1kg, are larger than what most vendors here on SR would send, especially via a postal service. The larger amounts you&#039;re talking about, around 1kg, are usually found more readily in Private Drug Forums on the Hidden Web. You may find a vendor who will sell you such large amounts, but if they have the skill and knowledge to send it through successfully, that&#039;s another thing altogether.<br />You should try to limit any info. you post about successful vendors to PM&#039;s only. The more you can restrict the information posted on successful deliveries, the better off we&#039;ll all be. Gifting LE any info. on vendor&#039;s having a lot of success delivering to Oz, will only result in it making their job easier and ours harder. :)

The fewer people that know about your methods, the safer you will be :)<br /><br />

				The drug I was talking about was coke. I have Pm&#039;d 3 different vendors who I had bought all 7g samples from but none wanted to send anything that large. I obviously suggested splitting the order into ounces. I have tried a few more vendors now. But the people who do have the capability aren&#039;t going to be advertising themselves here anyway so I will have to keep looking and start small.<br /><br />In regards to the Budworx vendor I was talking about here is their page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bd9b2bd948<br />and it only took 4 days to get their sample to the address here in Australia. Highly recommend this vendor for smaller stuff.<br /><br />Always weary what I post and now even PGP encrypt most messages so LE doesn&#039;t have too much to run by as I don&#039;t want any extra attention.
