				Recently, I took LSD with my friend. We began the experience at 9:30pm on Friday night and kept re-dosing with LSD throughout the night. We ended up tripping until 2:00am on Sunday morning without the use of any stimulants or other drugs aside from the LSD. It was truly an amazing experience. <br /><br />However, toward the end of the night of course I could feel my body wearing down. It was a horrible feeling to be so physically exhausted, but still have my mind racing with thoughts and new ideas. I was really desperate for the trip not to end and it got me wondering if I had some cocaine or meth on hand and I just did a small amount if it would destroy the physical exhaustion my body was feeling and let me go back to focusing on the wonderful epiphanies I was having.<br /><br />I have taken both cocaine and meth before, but I am not a regular user. I&#039;m aware of how it &#039;sharpens&#039; your mind and makes you not feel hungry. To me, this seems like this would be an ideal way to re-boost a prolonged LSD trip where your mind is being wore down only because your body is.<br /><br />You could say why not let it go and then just do the LSD a couple weeks later and why prolong it? There is something about doing it for a long amount of time that allows you to go places you couldn&#039;t on a shorter trip, trust me. Hence the idea to eventually combine it with some stimulant. I&#039;m mostly worried that the use of cocaine or the like will dull my mind and kill the trip. Thoughts? Has anyone done it? I would like to make it last throughout the weekend without the physical exhaustion.

				I&#039;ve known people who have mixed them, but I don&#039;t understand why.&nbsp; The coke&#039;s going to wear off long before your acid does and your just gonna be craving more coke.&nbsp; You&#039;ll also feel a lot more worn out the next day.<br />If you want to increase your acid experience then do some whippits and smoke a shit-ton of weed.

				Thanks for your advice. I have in the past used weed to enhance my acid experience and I&#039;ve found it works well. However, I would like to prolong my physical endurance and not enhance the trip. Just a final boost in the last few hours of the trip and definitely not taken early into it. I may give it a try later on in the month, but I am still very interested in other experiences.

				I&#039;ve done it many times. <br />Most of the time we&#039;d take the acid after a night of C - that&#039;s a great way to &quot;chill out&quot; afterwards and it does reset your serotonine receptors, so it helps for the craving and the &quot;hangover&quot;. <br />Sometimes we&#039;ve done C during the trip, but that&#039;s a little trick to make a heavy trip &quot;easier&quot; - it makes it less intense, but when the C is not having any more effect, then the intensity comes back...with a vengeance, so once you started snorting on LSD, you&#039;d better be sure that you have enough to go all the way... or not, but that could make the experience more intense than you would like. <br />Amphetamines are know for making you more sensitive to Lucy, but I&#039;m not sure how to combine those in such a way that it would make your trip last longer. I think you have to use some amphetamines just before or at the same time as your acid... look this up. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141180.msg966774#msg966774">Quote from: holmes on April 02, 2013, 08:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, toward the end of the night of course I could feel my body wearing down.

Tripping for a long time (24h or more) is really not that easy. Try eating stuff when it keeps on speaking to you, or running away, or dissapearing, ... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141180.msg966774#msg966774">Quote from: holmes on April 02, 2013, 08:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I would like to make it last throughout the weekend without the physical exhaustion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If this is really what you want (but be carefull with what you wish for) there are other products than LSD that would probably do the trick better... I know some RC&#039;s are long-lasting-psychedelics (up to 30 hours and more). <br />Combinations like LSD + 2C-B + mushrooms + DMT + baangh ... could give you the desired effect, but you&#039;d have to plan it out quite well and I&#039;m not sure you&#039;d be able to execute your plan once your in it for a few hours... <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m curious about your trip report&nbsp; :D

				It&#039;s a terrible idea. When you &quot;come down&quot; from a psychedelic experience, your exhausted for a reason. Your brain and body have just been through a very strenuous activity. Thinking that doing coke as your coming down will help you is absurd. You will crash 10 times harder when the stimulant wears off than you would have if you just let the psychedelic wear off on it&#039;s own. A psychedelic trip is not something to play around with, and adding a powerful stimulant like cocaine is just asking for trouble. Your natural brain chemistry will be totally thrown out of whack, as will your physical body. You are likely setting yourself up for a terrible crash, and a few days of deep depression.

				Thank you. I really appreciate taking the time to give me advice. I absolutely enjoy these forums because of that. The majority of the people are helpful in sharing their opinion or experience on the matter. Since you&#039;re curious, I have tripped already on LSD for over 24 hours. <br /><br />This past weekend I began a trip at about 9:00pm Friday that lasted until around 2:00am on Sunday morning. That&#039;s about 29 hours or so.<br /><br />I began the trip with three blotters which were tested here on SR at around 80 each. There was a heavy body load from it and it didn&#039;t really pass and I don&#039;t think I truly came up for about two hours. After that, we turned on the television and watches some pretty gruesome programs. It was intense and the few scenes where people had died, I felt like I died with them. I enjoyed the intensity and magnitude of the experience very much. It was exhausting, but highly entertaining. After that, we talked for awhile about life and the choices people make. <br /><br />A couple more hours into the trip we re-dosed another 200. We came back up especially strong and the visuals were intense. My white walls exploded into a thousand geometric shapes. The paintings on my walls were melting. The whole room had changed. We decided to put on a visually stunning movie and watched Life of Pi. For whatever reason, we weren&#039;t impressed and afterwards we were watching other programs unable to follow the plot or understand anything that was happening. It was truly strange and awesome to be so confused about simple concepts.<br /><br />A couple more hours later we re-dosed another 80 and would continue to do so throughout the trip. We alternated from watching every program we could think of, from horrible reality TV to proper drama to documentaries. Each program felt like we were exploring a different aspect of life.<br /><br />Once it became Saturday evening I started to feel physically tired. My friend was not, having slept better than me on Thursday night. I felt no headache or otherwise pain, but I was getting that sleepy feeling where your eyes just want to close. However, mentally I was still sharp. This is when I first wondered if I could prep up if I had a line of cocaine.<br /><br />Instead, I splashed cold water on my face, ate some vitamins, had some caffeine and ran around my house like a lunatic to get my heart rate up. It re-energized me and I continued to do this every couple hours to jump start myself again. By 10:00pm on Saturday it was starting to become too much and I was on the floor, so tired, but again still mentally sharp. Again, I just wished that I had a proper stimulant to boost myself, I was just not ready to let go.<br /><br />By midnight, I could barely talk to my friend, even though I was still getting overloaded with so many new ideas and concepts. At 2:00am we called it quits and I took some tramadol to help relax me. My friend took a sleeping pill, but I decided not to since it always gives me a hang over. I went into my room and tried to go to sleep, but I was up almost until 5:00am coming up with new ideas. I even got up at one point and typed them all out on my computer.<br /><br />It was truly amazing, but as you can see, it would have been nice to overcome my tiredness. I wouldn&#039;t even necessarily want it to last longer than it did, but I would like to feel physically sharp through the tail end.<br /><br />I might try the cocaine. I&#039;m set to trip again on April 19th for bicycle day.<br /><br />As for depression... yes I was very tired. I&#039;m still recovering even now and it&#039;s Tuesday night. Sunday and Monday may as well have not been for me because I slept through most of it. I still think it was worth it though.

				Man, coke is so &quot;moreish&quot; that I would hate to be fiending for another line while I was tripping. Eventually you&#039;re going to run out of coke (I&#039;m assuming), and then the crash is going to suck hard.

				I wanted to report back that I did try this last month. It was pretty interesting. I didn&#039;t push it too far though, but the experience was intense enough. About 18 hours into the trip, I dabbed some onto my gums and it was like nothing I ever felt before. It was if I could feel the drug go through my body straight to my heart and I could feel my blood pressure begin to raise and my heart begin to beat faster. I was so totally aware of exactly what was happening and I could feel almost like a veil being lifted from my eyes as my attention span became sharper and more focused. I was too concerned to take more or else it damage the wonderful circular way LSD makes you think, but it was very interesting to believe I was feeling my body wake up.

				Thanks for reporting back I am really interested in doing this as well. I wanted to know if you had a tough time sleeping after that or did you just dab some on your gums and that was it?

				I always have a tough time sleeping after acid. I don&#039;t think the cocaine really made it any worse, but then again I can usually fall asleep within a few hours after the last time I dose with cocaine without too much trouble. I usually take a combination of xanax and tramadol to be able to sleep after acid and I did that time, too.<br /><br />I might try it again, but I think generally speaking the two don&#039;t mix. My only intent on trying it at all was just to prolong the acid trip. The trips I do usually last around 30 hours, because I re-dose a few times throughout the night. It&#039;s an amazing experience, but it&#039;s no fun to start feeling exhausted around the 20 hour mark. Acid really takes a lot out of you.<br /><br />Right now, I think I&#039;ve found a better way. Last time I tripped I stayed up until 10:00am and this caused me to sleep until around 6:00pm. I basically just woke up and took the acid and was completely refreshed and lasted much longer physically than you might be able to if you wake up at a normal time and take LSD at night. I always take it at night, too, I just don&#039;t enjoy it nearly as much during the day. I think it&#039;s just more peaceful at night and the world is more quiet and you can open up your mind more. Man, I always hate when the sun starts coming up.
