				5/5 Packaging was without incident, printed labels, multiple vacuum layers and visual barriers.&nbsp; Shipping time was excellent 2-3 days from order to doorstep. <br /><br />5/5 Communication:&nbsp; Very fast and friendly responses to all questions and concerns<br /><br />5/5 Quality RosesGarden said this brownie is in between Regular and double strength she plans to provide. <br />Excellent taste, no overpowering cannabis flavor as I&#039;ve detected in other edibles.&nbsp; Ate whole brownie on an empty stomach.&nbsp; About 35 minutes in no real change detected.&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt a bit of a head change around an hour, plus all of a sudden full of energy and ready to do something.&nbsp; Take it these are sativa based&nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp;As a fairly heavy everyday smoker thinking the triple strength might be the way to go for me personally.&nbsp; Great new edibles vendor.&nbsp; Very professional and polite vendor.&nbsp; I will be using RosesGarden&nbsp; in the future as I have a few friends very interested in eating their medications&nbsp; ;D<br />

				Finally got my sample in today.&nbsp; Overall, my experience was very similar to sysco88&#039;s.<br /><br />Product ordered - Sample (45mg)<br />Packaging - 5/5&nbsp; - Proper labels, vacuum sealing, etc.&nbsp; No smell whatsoever.&nbsp; Brownie perfectly intact.&nbsp; <br />Speed - 5/5 - Ordered it Tuesday night, shipped Wednesday, got here Saturday<br />Vendor - 5/5 - Polite, punctual, no complaints.<br />Product - 5/5 - I wasn&#039;t expecting to go to space and I didn&#039;t, but I got more than I expected for sure.<br /><br />The brownie was delicious.&nbsp; Almost no earthy or plant matter taste at all.&nbsp; Quite dense but not dry.&nbsp; I had no problem devouring it within seconds of opening all the packaging on an empty stomach.&nbsp; I decided not to smoke today since I am usually a moderate everyday smoker and wanted to get a feel for the real potency of the brownie.&nbsp; Within an hour I was feeling a slight head change, and decided to turn on some music.&nbsp; It&#039;s been 3 hours since I ate it and I&#039;m getting a bit more stoned by the hour.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m at or near the peak of things and am satisfied with the experience so far.&nbsp; I feel a noticeable change in my headspace, but without the couchlock that most edibles I&#039;ve come across bring.&nbsp; Definitely made with a Sativa dominant strain, which I like.&nbsp; Overall, from beginning to end, this was a good experience, and I will definitely be trying the triple strength.&nbsp; Delicious product, good potency, great packaging, friendly vendor.&nbsp; We could always use more of this!<br />Thanks to RosesGarden for letting me sample her product, I will be a future customer for sure.

				Mulatto Bars<br /><br />Look: Awesome little joys of love !. the looked like a cookie and a brownie in 1 mix ! had it nice foundation of layered with a nice bottom layer of what i think was the oil and dank butter were set.<br /><br />Image Link: http://postimage.org/image/cj0valz0n/<br /><br /><br />Smell: Had this nice smell with a nice weed twist ! Really good choclate and cookie smell<br /><br />Taste: I loved the taste i can feel the fusion so perfect ! It has its consitency when being chewed and held very nice for being a mix of a cookie and brownie. First time i have ever tasted something of this nature :)<br /><br />Effect: Really light sweat, had me vibing just a tiny bit&#039;<br /><br />Package/Shipping: Awesome Vac Seals proplerly packaged with no smell, awesome labels, and correct postage, double stuctured package for added support and included DCN.<br /><br />OVERALL: 5 out 5 ! really awesome line up of selections, great communication, and really new and different tiers of potency levels for the edibles. Awesome prices, and great tasting too !<br /><br />I want a whole pie of everything baked NOW ! with or without weed , cuz its that good !<br /><br />I suggest you just sell like double max potency, cuz they are light, these edibles are too pretty to be just this light in effect<br /><br />i say throw some shrooms in there and use Kief or concentrated hash or trims to make extreme servings<br /><br />

				What&#039;s Up guys, I was fortunate enough to get one of Rose&#039;s free samples, here is my review....<br /><br />Product 45mg Sample:<br /><br />Packaging- 5/5 Not super super stealth but vac&#039;d VERY well and overall pretty discreet, however it is from a notorious cannabis state. Worries me.<br />Speed- 5/5 Mine took longer than others but I think it was just the timeframe that I ordered in.<br />Vendor- 10/5 SUPER NICE, Good Communication, related to very well, answers all questions.<br />Product- 4/5 It just didn&#039;t satisfy my high at all. I think it was the doseage/weight offset. The looks and taste were exquisite however. Brownie mixed with choc chip cookie! Tasted amazing with some milk. I felt the high come up very mildly. I never felt I peaked in any way. <br /><br />I recently ordered her new Double Strength Mollato bars in hopes to make my product review 5/5. Don&#039;t let me down rose.<br /><br />Will post next review when it arrives. On a positive note, it is already in transit :)<br /><br />

				Wow great seller! Let me review my most recent transaction with RosesGarden... Well I got a free sample originally to begin with, then I went ahead and ordered the double strength Mollotto Brownie/Cookie. First off...<br /><br />Communication- 5/5<br />This is always the first key thing that happens on a transaction in my&nbsp; opinion. Rose delivers. She is very efficient with responses and checking her messages. Super FAST. Her ETA&#039;s are off but ONLY because IT CAME EARLIER :D<br /><br />Shipping- 5/5<br />Ordered on Wednesday 13, recieved on the 15th.... This was absolutely superb. So fast it blew my mind, given it was priority the reason I got this before the weekend was because Rose got that shit in the mail fasstttt....On the stealth I don&#039;t want to reveal much detail but I have some advice, trip vac that mug!! With the double dose you need 3 Vacs easy I smelled through after I took off the first of the two, not really a flaw just a tad under super stealth imho.<br /><br />Quality- 5/5<br />This will be my favorite part to tell about. Oh how delicious it smelled even through 1 vac seal. It was obviously double dose just by the strong smell/taste of the bud. It wasn&#039;t in a bad taste either. The brownie/cookie 50%50% combo was baked to perfection and even fresh! So gooey! The high was the best however. I took it before a 3 hr road trip and stayed blowed on it easily 4 hours. Given I was smoking down I could strongly feel my body being affected as well as a few visuals, not trippy just as if things were moving inordinately. I loved it really, very mellow and &#039;lax....<br /><br />Awesome vendor will be back with my business!

				Here is my review of RoseGarden, a delectable new vendor on the Road.<br /><br />Shipping, Packaging, and Communication: I ordered 4x mulatto bars while Rose was running her free blunt promotion. I ordered on Wednesday the 20th and received them on Friday the 22nd. The packaging was as stealth as any bud I&#039;ve ordered on SR. The bars were vacuum sealed with multiple layers and there was no smell from the outside. Each bar is individually sealed which makes it nice for storage. I wonder how long these will stay fresh before spoilage if vacuum wrapped and refrigerated? Care to chime in Rose? The blunt was also in a ziplock, covered in tissue paper and vacuum wrapped. I carefully unwrapped it but unfortunately it was slightly damaged upon inspection. Communication so far has been courteous and professional. She even reached out to me about a preferred buyer program, which I have signed up for.<br /><br />Product and High: The brownie smelled nice and had a familiar aroma of what other &quot;medibles&quot; have. It was kind of hard and I wasn&#039;t smart enough to warm it up, which I wish I did. It tasted quite nice and left me wanting more. My friend also ate one which he warmed up and his was even nicer warm. Now for the high. Let me preface this by saying I have been smoking everyday for at least the last five years. I have a high tolerance and do multiple dabs daily and my experience with edibles have been generally disappointing. I went into this with little expectation. About an hour into the high I was definitely feeling it, vibing to the music, leaning in my chair, just generally relaxed. My voice also dropped an octave. It hit me but it wasn&#039;t a rocket ship. Maybe if I ate more&nbsp; :) My friend who doesn&#039;t smoke much was blitzed. He watched some stand up on netflix and was laughing / zoning out the entire time. I would say his name and he didn&#039;t respond. A little later, he told me he wanted me to get him more, so I&#039;m going to go ahead and do that for him :)<br /><br />The one disappointment: Rose, babe, you make a dank brownie... your grandmother taught you well, no doubt. Its evidenced by my repeat order. But... that blunt Rose. I&#039;m guessing your grandmother never taught you how to roll a nice blunt, haha&nbsp; :P I&#039;m just messing with ya, I appreciate the effort, but I didn&#039;t smoke it. The wrap was dry and cracked, you put a filter in it which I personally don&#039;t do in blunts and it was rolled with some... well... not so great shake. Not my style. Thanks for trying though. It convinced me to discover you which was a gift in itself. Looking forward to future business!<br /><br />Overall. 5/5 Great Edible Vendor! Would and am buying again.<br /><br />

I love strawberry gummies and these will have hash in them? OMFG!!&nbsp; That is so killer! +1 and I wish I could give you a +1000. Yes an honest stellar review will follow and let the promotions begin as well. <br /><br />Hey Rosanne good point. I mean it would be easy for a vendor to just send out some regular gummies right? I don&#039;t think that will happen tho because this vendor has done everything to prove trust and honest to our community right? Don&#039;t worry I will do these right. I know there is a difference in edibles and smoking and as for me I&#039;ll follow the directions given for heavy smokers and will eat them on an empty stomach. I&#039;m thinking about fasting the day b4 and then chewing them up the next morning about an hour after I wake up. <br /><br />Hey wavelength I know right? Well I was just screwed out of some money from another vendor (GYF) and so Life has been good about it and given me a replacement yes! B4 the last win from cimicon I had been screwed over by another vendor hahaha.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually a giver in a lot of ways here and in real life. <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to get these gummies thank you so much RosesGardens and Congrats to Whiteout and blitz2000. I was sleeping just now and just woke up out of the blue for no reason and now I am glad I did.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Going to throw up a little review on my most recent buy from rose!<br /><br />4X Mollotto Brownies dbl strength! w/ 1.2 gram blunt for free<br /><br />Shipping- 5/5 Fastest yet! I believe it took 2 days in all to get here and actually beat Mr.Humboldts 1/8 he was sending prior to my order with rose! There were 4 brownies and a blunt total all vac sealed and no stench whatsoever. I was impressed. Her communication is always top notch!<br /><br />Quality- I feel the high on these varies. While it always does get me fucked up I think that some of them are more potent than others. I have taken 3 of my 4 all with different levels of high! I am saving the last for my mother and I will see what she thinks bout it! It&#039;s always a good time when I am smoking down after one of rose&#039;s brownies, they really boost your whole smoke sesh&#039;s for the next couple of hours!<br /><br />@Heatfan I am with you bro we need to teach Rose how to roll a bleezy better! Go for the cigarillos and not the wraps next time! I like my blunts tight and slow burning, not actual cigar size and burning fast! But it was free and it did get me a lil toasted so I am not going to hate a lot!

				My review on Rose item ****Note I got her overburned batch (which tasted fine to me)*****<br /><br /><br />Got the items within 5 days from order awesome! <br /><br />stealth is good.<br /><br />Product is good also I have a very high tolerance. So eat 1 bar and smoked some good bud. well way to blazed. so i take another one after 5 hours. puts my ass right to sleep after my dinner. <br /><br />overall happy with my purchase. i&#039;ve had overall disappointment with medical grade stuff cause it usually was way to weak for me so I would have to eat like 4 of them. but with this I think 2 would be more than enough for me.<br /><br />Thanks rose!

				Little late on my review but here it is:<br /><br />Communication -------- Great communication. The seller is very respectful and replies in a timely fashion. Very good communication overall.<br /><br />Shipping --------- Was beyond great. Received in three days. Could not be more happy.<br /><br />Quality --------- Ordered brownies and some hash gummys. Overall I have a high tolerance so took me 3 gummys to feel nice but overall I liked the product. Did it&#039;s job and the dosage recommended was def on point. The brownies gave me a nice buzz and had a nice effect to them. I will order again.<br /><br /><br />A++++

				Quick and stealthy shipping is a 5/5. Nice layers of vac seal! <br /><br />So far so good and I do mean GOOD. These strawberry gummies are delicious. I can&#039;t stay out of them. I have already ate 6 and gave 2 to my brother. I am having a hard time staying out of them but I want to gauge the potency of the 6 first. It has not been ten minutes since I ate those. I have had nothing to eat except for those gummies today. I do notice some euphoria starting to creep up and an all around feeling better. These will definitely hit the spot as I woke up with a head ache but no head acheing now! <br /><br />During the time I have been PMing RosesGarden and writing this the euphoria has doubled and it&#039;s still growing. There&#039;s no doubt that these are full of THC. I can smell it on the gummies but the taste is delicious with no overpowering marijuana taste at all. Yea I definitely feel like I been smoking some good herb. <br /><br />Thanks RosesGarden for this amazing win of your lotto. I won 16 gummies and they were all there and in perfect condition. Wow they are strong as I just caught myself in a daze. You may be the best edibles vendor on&nbsp; the road. You are definitely going to be featured in my TopVendorsList and I&#039;ll report this in the cannabis threads as well.<br /><br />This is a great way for people to ingest this awesome medicine. It&#039;s snowing down here so they are perfect right out of the box

				I have been really enjoying these gummies. I stored them in the freezer and they are great like that jkust like Rose said. And to say that 6 is a good dose for a heavy smoker is not to be taken lightly. Just a couple hours after eating those 6 earlier today I had peaople asking me what was I on? They said my eyes were bloodshot as red as they could be. Lol I found a mirror and yea I looked like I was on acid or something. I was in a psychedelic type of marijuana high. I will want more of these and your vendor page says to ask you about re-selling? I am asking becaiuse I&#039;d like to set up shop down here in my neighborhood.&nbsp; Some people are more apt to try marijuana&nbsp; as an edible

HOLY SHIT lmao<br /><br />Here&#039;s my review.<br /><br />5/5 Shipping as always! Quick &amp; Stealthy!<br /><br />5/5 Customer Service! Rose is always good to chat with about orders!<br /><br />5/5 Quality! Unlike Mike I only ate 4! Man were they enough. I was fucking faded!. Given I had been smoking I could definitely tell what part of my high the hash gummies were affecting. It gave me a super good stone. I took them before a 1v1 interview with my teacher and wow. If I wouldn&#039;t have been on a adderall and been able to talk fast and properly like I can when I am on them I would have been fucked. Like Mike said these really make you look fucked up like to the max! I would suggest 4 if you want to have a very nice high &amp; smoke quite a bit. I didn&#039;t want to venture to 6 really. I think it would put me to sleep. The taste wasn&#039;t actually too bad at all. I didn&#039;t refrigerate mine like rose recommended, you can taste the hash/bud taste for sure but it&#039;s not bad at all! I loved the experience overall and will pick some of these up in the near future!

				Ordered 10 Gummies, got them quick and easy - very nice packaging.<br /><br />I have absolutely no tolerance - I smoke maybe once a year, so I decided to start with one, and got knocked very nicely on my ass for several hours. <br />The taste is, honestly, a stronger hash taste than candy taste, but quite pleasant. And the buzz rolled in in about an hour, enveloped me so that I felt like I was wearing a football helmet made of cotton candy, and just kept going.<br />I&#039;ve got to be a bit more social tonight, so I&#039;m trying one-half of one, to see if that gets me a nice mild buzz that still leaves me feeling coherent and able to communicate.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D ;D

				I ordered Roses&#039; cookie/brownie bar and they are great! <br /><br />They are double vac-sealed and the packaging is good. I got my order two days after it was processed. The bar itself was on the small size but HOLY SHIT are they strong! They taste pretty good, I didn&#039;t have to microwave them, they were just fine, but it does a weed-taste that I don&#039;t mind too much to be honest. I have a relatively low tolerance so I ate half of it and after about an hour I got completely blitzed. I will definitely order more once I get some more money :) <br /><br />5/5 Thanks Rose!

				So I just received Rose&#039;s mulatto bars yesterday. Shipping&nbsp; time was good. The shipping method is VERY professional, so it doesn&#039;t look suspicious at all. Rose goes to great lengths in this respect. I was worried that the packaging would have crushed the goods, but they were all perfectly intact! They were also vacuumed seal, and I couldn&#039;t smell anything at all until I cut them open. I thought the treats looked kind of small, and I contemplated eating two. Today, I can report that I&#039;m very glad I didn&#039;t eat two lol. I was almost TOO high off of just one of these little guys. They taste pretty good, and I actually prefer the size. Some other edibles I&#039;ve gotten off the road are like these giant hunks that have me feeling uncomfortably full after forcing myself to finish them. Not Rose&#039;s mulatto bars! They are the perfect snack-size in my opinion. And they definitely pack a punch! Thanks again, Rose!

				Just got my first order of gummies from Roses. Did 1 to test it out and I couldn&#039;t be happier! These are a great product and will be excellent for traveling I think.<br /><br />Roses Garden was great to deal with as a total newbie. She had mentioned on her page that she was going to be a couple of days backed up around Easter, but a couple of days after ordering it went to in-transit and I got a nice note to let me know. Very pleasant. Order arrived yesterday with very good stealth.<br /><br />Great product from a great vendor.

				Ordered the sample pack on Sunday and received it on Thursday. Well packaged and left no fears about ordering more.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried the Mulatto bar yet, but the wife and I grabbed a couple of the gummies and headed to the zoo. We only did one apiece since we had no baseline. <br /><br />Ate them walking up to the ticket gate, and by the time we hit the first exhibit we were thinking happy thoughts. A nice, light high that popped in and out all afternoon and was polite enough to let go when it was time to drive home. Two apiece would probably have been optimal, but probably would have had to stay longer at the zoo.<br /><br />Once you figure out your dose the gummies are perfect to pack in your sack for a day out&nbsp; 8)

				I ordered more gummies on Friday and received them on Tuesday. This is a fantastic product, IMO, if you&#039;re into edibles. Small and stealthy, and overall very clever. I take 1 for a light-duty all purpose high, and 2 if I want to get a more full flavored stone on. Much easier to store and travel with than brownies or cookies - I would take these anywhere without fear of attracting unnecessary attention.&nbsp; Great vendor and great product - thanks RosesGarden!!

				I bought two of your sampler packs a couple weeks back. Wonderful stuff. Definitely stronger than the last batch of edibles I bought elsewhere on SR. Packed well, no smell at all from outside the package. I&#039;ve gotta get me a vacuum sealer.<br /><br />The gummies are a bit more skunky than fruity, and would&#039;ve probably been better if I had frozen them first. Still, nice and strong. I&#039;m very much a lightweight and newbie - half a gummy gets me somewhat relaxed, one gummy gets me pleasantly buzzed on a full stomach, and a little room-spinny on an empty stomach.<br /><br />As soon as I got them, I ate two gummies as recommended. I had to take the afternoon off and sleep off the spinniness. Good potency. The only thing I can recommend for the gummies is to pack them in a bit more corn starch. One or two ended up adhered to the bag and kind of sticky. I added some corn starch of my own to keep them easy to retrieve.<br /><br />The mulatto bars - those are lasting me. Just a little nibble here and there. In addition to the chocolate and brown sugar flavors, they have the expected weedy undertones, but also some floral, hoplike overtones once you get to chewing it. (I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m writing a culinary review of pot brownies.)<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering - do you know what kind of strains you used in that batch? (Ordered 3/25-ish, 8 gummies and 2 mulatto bars.) I like the high I got from them a bit better than other edibles I&#039;ve tried on SR, and being new to all this, I&#039;m trying to find what works best for me. I like a numbing, body high feeling better than a psychedelic head high most of the time, and your edibles delivered on that for the most part. Any recommendations?<br /><br />Note: I don&#039;t smoke/vape/anything else, just eat. If you have recommendations for *very* discreetly smoking or some other faster-than-eating intake method, I&#039;d love to know; or if you can point me toward any other SR vendor that can help. I&#039;m not above tweaked improvised methods. Taking a hit from an apple and then blowing it out through a vacuum HEPA filter looks ridiculous, but I bet it would help with discretion. At the moment, edibles + soda + a mint seem to be working.<br />

				Do not order from this seller. &gt;:(<br /><br />RosesGarden made the choice to gamble on the BTC market by not hedging their sales. They sure as hell profited from the meteoric rise in BTC prices. Then the market takes a downturn, and this vendor cancels all of their pending sales.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, if you gamble, you take your losses like a man. You can&#039;t take your winnings and just cancel your losses. This is extremely poor business and I will not be returning any business, even at the lower prices you have advertised. You knew what you were doing when you didn&#039;t hedge.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken my business to another vendor that has business ethics and knows how to handle their customers.

				Bought some mulatto bars and some gummies. I first took one whole gummy, and it was too powerful for me, and I ended up sleeping early, so I will go with a half gummy next time. I had no cannabis tolerance at the time, and I was 160 lb, so it hit me hard. Next, I tried 1/8 of a mulatto bar, and it was a very mellow, smooth high.

				My roomie bought some gummies from RosesGarden and gave me some and man they were great!! I&#039;ve took 2 the first time, and it was my first time eating edibles too! My whole body was like wooooooooaaah :o the first 2 hours and then I just had the whole day just going like wooooah ;D I was GONE! yeah these gummies hit pretty hard. real dank gummies. These was the red ones btw ;) The 2nd time I took them, I had one, and this time it had me feeling all happy and mellow inside for a good 5-6 hours. One was perfect for me, as I had low tolerance and overall I&#039;d say it was a great high and a great first experience with edibles. <br /><br />Shipping 5/5 - Placed order, Next day in transit, with a kind message thanking me for my order and telling me not to FE, as this was basically my first transaction (I&#039;ve placed orders but haven&#039;t finalized yet cause i haven&#039;t received them yet), as for my roommate, stealth was great, received his double vacuumed sealed? triple? don&#039;t remember. either way I didn&#039;t smell anything at all until we cut open the package. <br />Quality 5/5 - Basically tastes and smells like THC in a fruity gummy bear. Nice and chewy. Extremely potent. I&#039;ve been a smoker for quite a while and I can tell there are high amounts of THC in them. After my 2 experiences with these gummies, (I had low tolerance) I knew I built up tolerance as I could feel it when I smoked a joint with my buddies.<br />Communication 5/5 - Pretty self explanatory<br />Speed 5/5 - This vendor processes orders fairly quickly compared to the others on SR, my roomie got his within the week he ordered the gummies.<br /><br />Thank you RosesGarden!<br />EPIC VENDOR, EPIC PRODUCT! <br />Will definitely be coming back for more! :)

				Everything is awesome as far as shipping and stealth goes. <br /><br />I smoke about every weekend but sometimes I miss a weekend or two. I pretty much stay high on the weekends. This was my second attempt at edibles.<br /><br />I ordered the sampler pack. I got four gummies and a brownie.<br />I ate 3 gummies, they were delicious. After 30 minutes I felt a very mild high. I waited for another hour for it to fully kick in but it didn&#039;t get much stronger. I was going to eat two as was recommended, but I took 3 because I wanted to be sure I would FEEL it. I wish I had taken all four, because 3 felt like the other edible I tried on SR(a sucker from a weed vendor). Just a very mild high is all i got. Maybe I underestimated my tolerance? I&#039;m thinking I need more gummies for them to work the way I want them to. <br /><br />These gummies would be great for stealth medicating. You&#039;d never suspect a thing unless you tasted them.<br /><br />I have had a friend have a panic attack on a brownie with his eyes blistering red, and he had smoked many times before. So I was kind of hoping for a sucker punched level of stoned. Maybe I&#039;ll get that with the brownie.<br /><br />I will most likely eat the brownie tomorrow. Hopefully it is stronger. I will update about the brownie after I have taken it.<br /><br />Should I take 1/2 brownie or just eat the whole thing and take the other gummie with it? That gummy by itself is not worth much to me.<br />Maybe 1/2 brownie plus 1 gummy.<br /><br /><br />Rose was friendly and shipped in a timely manner during the BTC drop. Great stealth. Great seller. Maybe recommend more gummies per dose though. :)<br />I really got a deal too, because I ordered the sampler pack at the height of the btc prices. They dropped so low the day after I ordered. Great service from Rose!<br /><br />Rose is great! Go ahead, give her a try.<br /><br />UPDATE: I ate a Mulatto bar and a gummy and an hour later I feel fantastic. The brownie was great and I threw the other gummy in and I am very stoned.<br /><br />The Mulatto bar was stronger than the gummies. Great vendor.<br /><br />Thanks Rose.

				Damn, was hoping to pick up another batch of the gummies but looks like I&#039;ll have to wait.<br /><br />I took two gummies and got high as fuck, almost uncomfortably high for a brief time and then I was fine. These come on very fast, after about an hour I was thinking to myself that I was not very high and then BAM! it hit me hard. I then went to 1 gummy the next time and it was a mild high perfect for work or when I need to get things done.<br /><br />Almost everyone I gave them to found 1-2 to be a very good dose. One friend who is a heavy smoker took 4 and he was the highest I&#039;ve seen him in quite some time. VERY good edibles in my opinion at a reasonable price. I&#039;ll be picking up 32 or 64 when RosesGarden gets her listings back up

				Had some coin leftover so decided to give the hash gummy candies a shot. Not something I normally eat (gummy anything) but I liked that the weed taste wasn&#039;t overpowering as so many edibles are. <br /><br />I am a heavy smoker who had taken a week off, decided to take two of them and in 45 minutes felt a nice medium body buzz going. Lasted a few hours. Now that I&#039;ve found somebody selling edibles that don&#039;t taste so &quot;weedy&quot; I am definitely going to order more from this vendor as an alternative to smoking so much. :)

				Rosesgarden is the first vendor i have used and the experience was great. I tried the sampler pack and was definitely not disappointed. <br /><br />Communication was excellent.<br /><br />Shipping was super quick, about 3 days i think. <br /><br />Packaging was super stealthy and well done. The brownie was all together and looks delicious. The hash candy was melted together, but that is because i did not opt for the melt protection. I know that Rose is looking to make the melt protection even better and I will get that packaging option for all of my future purchases. Packaging also had professional labels on it and was fully legit. I have no worries about any of my future purchases making it to me safely. <br /><br />The hash candy tasted great. I was surprised that I started to feel the high pretty quickly, and it lasted for many hours. I cannot wait to try out the brownie. <br /><br />Rose is a great vendor!&nbsp; &nbsp;I am looking forward to doing business with her very soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thank you very much for the product RosesGarden, it was delicious and potent!<br /><br />I ordered 4 pieces of the Hash gummies, and I received them about a week after I ordered them. The packaging was very good, and no smell could be detected outside the last wrapper. It tasted delicious, and potent! definitely will order more in the future.

				This is just some info for Rose regarding the gummies and the express melt protection. <br /><br />I ordered the gummies and they arrived super quick!&nbsp; I live in the middle of the country, and it has been very hot here.&nbsp; I knew that the gummies might melt, so i went for the express melt protection. My gummies arrived today, and they had a plastic baggie over them from the US postal service. The baggie contained a note that apologized for what looked like water damage to the package. Now, the package was unopened, and it appeared as if it had been wet and then dried. I received the package and opened it. The gummies are totally fine; unmelted, looking delicious. The packaging on the inside is also intact, no tears or damage. But i did notice that there was still some condensation on the inside vacuum packaging. <br /><br />So, basically I am telling you this because I hope it helps you out a little with your future transactions. The package seemed to get only the slightest notice from the postal workers, and it was because of the condensation from the ice pack inside. You and your customers probably want as little scrutiny of your packages as possible, and I hope that this post helps provide you with some info about how the packages are looking as they make it to their destinations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, the gummies on the inside definitely looked great. They remained unmelted and mostly separate from one another. Shipping gummy candy across the country, in the summer, is surely not easy to do, and Rose&#039;s method is pretty damn good. I hope that the info in this post is somewhat helpful to her. thanks again!

				First order with RosesGarden, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />Packaging: 5/5 - Very clever, very professional. Would not conceivably raise suspicion.<br />Speed: 5/5 - I had told her I would need it by the weekend, so she put it in transit quick. Placed the order on a Tuesday I believe, package was here by Friday morning. THANK YOU!!! <br />Communication: 5/5 - Prompt with messages and pleasant vendor to communicate with.<br />Product: 5/5 - Looks and smells tasty as fuck. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I think me and some guys are eating half a bar each tonight. Will update.<br /><br />Overall, I had great perfect buying experience with RosesGarden. Can&#039;t wait to buy from her again - definitely my top choice for edibles from here on out. <br /><br />*EDIT* - Forgot to include what I ordered: 4 quad strength cookies and cream bars.

				I ordered the sample Priority with melt protection. It arrived three days to east coast.<br /><br />I could smell the brownie after opening my mailbox, which was unnerving. It could have used another layer of sealing. Without taking the smell into account, the rest of the stealth was great and it even fooled a friend who picked up and examined the treats. <br /><br />The melt protection seems to have done it&#039;s job. I will probably order with melt protection in the future because of the summer heat.<br /><br />The cookies &amp; cream bar was smaller than I imagined and seemed a bit flattened. <br /><br />Breaking a two month t-break, I took about 1/5th of the cookies &amp; cream bar. It was a gentle come-up which plateaued with me unable to use the copy-paste function on my computer. The gummies weren&#039;t as sour as I was hoping, but they were sweet, earthy, and gave me a light and enjoyable high. <br /><br />Overall, the product is good and I would order again. RG&#039;s sealing could use some work, but it&#039;s fine for edibles.

				I&#039;ve eaten 1/4th of a quad strength bar and then 3/8ths yesterday, but both times were a bit underwhelming. The 1/4th felt like a really long buzz, the 1/3 felt like a really long but not especially powerful high, almost like a &quot;background&quot; high instead of something that I was truly feeling.<br /><br />I think my tolerance is a lot higher than I give myself credit for...<br /><br />I might just go ahead and try 1/2 and hope I don&#039;t schizo out.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t really a complaint or a real review, just posting my anecdote.<br /><br />I will say I was really impressed by the stealth/packaging and the delivery time. I believe I had ordered on a Sunday and had my stuff the following Tuesday.<br /><br />EDIT: 1/2 was decent but still a bit underwhelming. 3/4 of a bar was a pretty nice spot. Now I&#039;ve just got two bars left, one slightly bigger than the other. Think I&#039;ll just eat each one whole, starting with the smaller.<br /><br />The product description for these bars with the guy with a supposedly high tolerance puking after eating a full bar? Are we eating the same product?

				RosesGarden is a fantastic vendor, plain and simple.<br /><br />Packaging: Vacuum protected with no smell, and the goods were very well protected. Priority Melt Protection didn&#039;t entirely save the gummies but they were fine and came apart without incident after sticking them in the freezer. Shipping only took four days. Absolutely no smell until I broke through the final layer of packaging, and the smell wasn&#039;t even that potent (having never ordered cannabis off of SR I was kind of paranoid about my room smelling like weed the second I opened the bag, but that wasn&#039;t a problem).<br /><br />Stealth: Really good stealth. Rose isn&#039;t lying when she says it could fool anybody who opened the package.<br /><br />Product: I ate half a brownie and I was fucking out of here. Really intense, almost psychedelic. &quot;Very potent&quot; is not a lie. Definitely going to eat less than half of a brownie at a time from now on. It was quite tasty though, and didn&#039;t taste of hash! Edibles my friends have given me have tasted like shit before but Rose&#039;s brownies tasted quite nice. Have yet to try the gummies though.<br /><br />All in all RosesGarden is definitely my future go-to for weed edibles.

				Ordered one of the cookies and cream brownies.<br /><br />Speed:&nbsp; 5/5 Was placed in transit the next day mail was shipping.&nbsp; Got it in 2-3 days if I remember right.<br /><br />Stealth:&nbsp; &nbsp;5/5 Good for edibles.&nbsp; Package wouldn&#039;t warrant a second glance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Communication:&nbsp; 5/5 Vendor let me know when it shipped.<br /><br />Product:&nbsp; 5/5&nbsp; Looked a little small, but 1/4 worked perfectly for me, so no worries there.&nbsp; Don&#039;t underestimate these.&nbsp; They&#039;re more potent than you think.&nbsp; Tasted great too!<br /><br />Would definitely order from this vendor again! <br />

				TL;DR - RosesGarden is legit - order with confidence.<br /><br />I ordered a couple of the sampler packs (1xCookies and Cream Bar, 4xHash Gummies).&nbsp; Package arrived to the southern US two days from shipping.&nbsp; The stealth was awesome; got a chuckle out of it.&nbsp; Not going to divulge any details, but you&#039;ll see when you get a package, which I recommend you do.<br /><br />First, to set expectations, I am a moderate daily smoker.&nbsp; I get high every day...just typically not all day long&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So, down to brass tacks.&nbsp; I get a nice mild/medium high from just two of the gummies.&nbsp; Gives me a great body feel and a big smile on my face the whole time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never taken more than two, though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also shared the same dosage with a friend who doesn&#039;t smoke as much as me, and they gave rave reviews.&nbsp; Heavy smokers looking for a heavy buzz should probably take 4.<br /><br />The cookies and cream bars, first of all, are DELICIOUS.&nbsp; The potency (Quad Strength) is no joke.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten a decent buzz from just one bite (about 1/8 of the bar).&nbsp; Taking 1/4 of the bar gives a much bigger experience than two of the gummies.&nbsp; Not overwhelming, but definitely more.&nbsp; Feels like a big warm hug.&nbsp; You know what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; If you want to lose a few hours, eat half the bar.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend eating a whole bar unless you&#039;ve got a crazy high tolerance.<br /><br />These things (the gummies and the bars) taste so good, you&#039;d never guess they were packed with so much awesomeness.<br /><br />Anyway - if you&#039;re wondering whether or not you should order something from RosesGarden, just do it.&nbsp; I just placed another order, myself.

				What a fantastic vendor.<br /><br />Seems like I am ordering from Amazon with this seller, communication is always perfect and the product arrives discreetly. Oh ya, did I mention that these edibles will wreck you, I am a daily smoker and these things knock me on the couch. Really great product.<br /><br />I have had multiple orders with RosesGarden and now going to try the new Cannapops. Can&#039;t wait..<br /><br />Thanks RG! 10/10<br /><br />-ES
