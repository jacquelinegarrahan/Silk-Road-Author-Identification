Silk Road is not in the business of exacting vigilante justice. We strongly advise that buyers do not FE, as by doing so they leave themselves open to being scammed; however, if they choose to FE against our advice then that is their own issue and we are unable to help.<br /><br />This guy got away with people&#039;s money because they FE&#039;d. Buyers need to know that they should never FE for any vendor.<br /><br />Libertas

				If you paid him before cashing out then that was real stupid. Other than that, you made a mistake trying to cash out for him in the first place, that would instantly go off as extremely sketchy to me. Other than that, 80 btc is more than 1400..? That&#039;s 8 grand. So I&#039;m a bit confused. Did you cash out for him, then have your account locked due to the transaction and can no longer buy with your original funds? If that&#039;s the case, then as previously noted you took the foolish risk without thinking and this is the repercussion, no one cares about the rest of what you&#039;re saying. Tying him up or some other nonsense will solve nothing.. Killing him will solve nothing, go take your money back one way or another, or drop it and move on.

				I&#039;m looking for Jon Voight&#039;s LeBaron convertible. If you guys see that at his dad&#039;s used car lot, pick that up for me and make a custom listing. I don&#039;t know if the top is all ripped out that might bring the price down. If there&#039;s any speed holes no problem I can bondo those over. Thanks and good luck.

				This SilkRoad drama is amusing to say the least. DR1 fucks up, gets banned, creates several new accounts to unblock his frozen money and is now trying to fake his own death.<br />Isn&#039;t there an age requirement to be a vendor?

				an &amp; and? Whats that have to do with anything and I would post the mesages I sent to sr support an libertas but i can&#039;t because it his dr1&#039;s info in it so with that said i am not all these other people you guys think i am. <br /><br />my name is being tarnished so now if a sellers see&#039;s this about my handle being mixed up with dr1 or even saying i am him needs to come to a end because my name means a lot to me even here on the net an honestly the money was just given to me that was locked in my account so i don&#039;t mind anymore about the money but would still like to purchase items from my account since i have been a bulk buyer for a little while now an my stats mean a lot to me also so for everyone thinking i just want money or just want my name to be clear an to have my buyer account pin back. You can ask how much was in there it was only 1600 an dr1 just paid me it in cash but i did tell him i am giving his info out if people ask (if i will get banned then i won&#039;t) we had a little fight i guess you can call it i&#039;m 220 5&#039;9 plus i use to juice so i picked his skinny ass up by his neck then just kept yelling he thought it was a joke but after i showed him and told him he is shook plus i told him if he doesnt give the money back people are going to come look for him 100% plus he did give me a % of the money ran through my account so i told sr support an libertas i will give my % that i made off his scamming since i want no dirty money so plese dont flame me instead lets try and get him to pay some people back if not all<br /><br />-Shabba
