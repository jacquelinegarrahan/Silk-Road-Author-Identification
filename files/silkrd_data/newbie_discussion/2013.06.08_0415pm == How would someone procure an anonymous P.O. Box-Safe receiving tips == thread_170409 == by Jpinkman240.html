				Hello everyone, <br /><br />I am a new potential buyer and I am trying to be as safe as possible. From what I have read having shipments sent to a P.O. Box adds an extra layer of security to this process. How is this different than having something shipped to your home address if the P.O. Box is registered to you? Is there a way to procure a P.O. Box anonymously? Are there other ways to have something shipped &quot;safely&quot;? Any and all receiving shipments tips would be greatly appreciated&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks, <br />J

				it has been suggested that you don&#039;t use a PO box for your purchases, but rather your home address. anonymous or not, if law enforcement wants to bust you they&#039;ll be waiting at your PO box and slapping cuffs on you as soon as you grab that package. it&#039;s a risk we all take as members of the chemical counterculture.<br /><br />but really, if you&#039;re ordering personal amounts for you and your friends there&#039;s no need to worry. it&#039;s the bigger packages they&#039;re scrutinizing.

				Just out of curiosity, I went to my local UPS store to ask about renting a box. First, it was expensive! Second, they said they would need to photocopy my government issued ID, then send it for verification to the postal service to make sure I&#039;m a real person, or something, blah blah. In other words, NOT anonymous. And not cheap. But something less corporate might have more lenient policies.

				There are a few other possibilities g using someones holiday house, house for sale, or any other unoccupied address. Be sure to test out the address with some letters to make sure it doesn&#039;t use forwarding.

				I am in the same boat right now. <br /><br />In aus apparently we dont need to show photo ID, just 2 bills showing your home address. <br /><br /><br />In my opinion, this seems like the best way to receive goods by being anonymous. As long as you only pick up your stuff late at night when no one could be watching! right?

There is even a special way just for you immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, the monitoring can be carried out at night. For your benefit I will present three examples for you ....<br />1. HighRes hidden camera<br />Two. Fingerprint analysis of the door / box / etc<br />Three. GPS Tracking in the package<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can beat each of these surveillance techniques, but can you think of others thaty are going to use?

And madness. Sparta Madness.<br /><br />If LE are watching a drop they watch it 24 hours a day. They won&#039;t be ready to pounce office hours. They&#039;ll notice you as much at midnight as midday. Probably more at midnight as there are fewer people to hide you. You might as well be busted in the convenience of your own home.<br /><br />If LE are NOT watching the drop then NOBODY cares about you picking up your Bad Boy Dildo parcel or whatever the hell it is you buy online. You might as well have it sent at home and have the convenience of that delivery.<br /><br />A SAFE PICK-UP SPOT IS USELESS WITHOUT A THIRD PARTY COURIER<br /><br />If you can get a courier - and by that I mean someone you can hire/pay/trust not to run off with the goods; but who does not know your name or address - then perhaps you can send them to get the parcel. Give them a cash-bought prepaid mobile, you have another. Watch them (without them knowing) as they make the pick-up. If they&#039;re not busted they should follow the plan of go outside the Post Office (or wherever) and they text you &quot;DONE&quot; and then you text them the location of the meet. Each meet must be different.<br /><br />And then I guess you have to pay the courier.<br /><br />I&#039;d consider this for a barrel of precursors or five thousand pills, but it seems a lot of effort for a gram of Molly and a half an ounce of bud.<br />

				If it&#039;s for personal purchases it&#039;s not really worth it. Some vendors ship to PO boxes just has to be a valid name. Receiving stuff on gov&#039;t property where there may be cameras can be risky. Vendors who use it usually get fake id&#039;s and take some other safety precautions. But for personal purposes then you are adding using false identity to get the box on top of anything else.
