				I just got my 110 dollars worth of bitcoins today (4ish btc) and bought LSD from Lucydrop seemed like a good deal I think for 70 bucks for 10, 100 ug blotters.<br /><br />Wish me luck, it&#039;s my first time trying anything out of weed, dph and dissociatives (just DXM ;_;).<br /><br />I hope I have fun.

				Woo, popped the cherry! Wishing you good luck with the experience. I&#039;ve always had good times with LSD, but it&#039;s definitely something to be treated with respect.&nbsp; Be sure you&#039;re in a good head space when you start. :)

				I got a 50 from LD a week ago, I hope its good.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t impressed with the &quot;blotter&quot; it was laid on though, it was more like cardboard than blotter, hoping its good yet though.

				Good choice. I took 1.5 tabs of LucyDrop&#039;s AlphaCentari print and it was incredible. If you&#039;re used to psychedelics and you want strong visuals you might go more towards the 2.5 tab mark, but I had a great time, it was clean as all get-go, tripped for like 13 hours with a nice warm afterglow, had a great time.<br /><br />Good to hear I wasn&#039;t the only one trip-trapping around on Single Awareness Day (aka V-Day for the lonely).<br /><br />LDrop does sacred work, haven&#039;t had any issues with them/him/her/they.<br /><br />Had two successful larger orders with FE cross-borders no problems at all. Did I mention it&#039;s clean? It&#039;s really good stuff. Not sure I&#039;ve ever had any L this legit. <br /><br />Good choice, good choice. Just remember to be patient. Anywhere from 10-14 days, maybe longer, depending on where you&#039;re at in the world.

				When I started to take drugs my older brother gave me some wise words..<br /><br />Abuse the drugs but don&#039;t let the drugs abuse you<br /><br />You can always add, but you can&#039;t always take away. So respect what it is you take and everything should be fine

				I think I might have overdone it, LOL. My first order was on 8 February and I&#039;ve already spend about US $1500. I am a western expat living in Asia so it&#039;s hard to speak the language, let alone find drugs. Anyway, I purchased a small amount of heroin&nbsp; (.20g) because I&#039;ve never tried it and have always wanted to try just a little bit, as well as some valium and percocet (so I can kick my hardcore Tramadol addiction), modafinil, and a fuckin&#039; TON of blow. The blow alone is coming from three different vendors. So, the end result is that in the next 7-14 days I should have about 9 different packages coming to my house! Fuck, I hadn&#039;t thought about that when I ordered the shit. Probably should have taken it wayyyyy easier on the ordering. On the bright side, my mailman doesn&#039;t speak or read English, he just knows my address, and anything labeled with it goes in my mailbox. I know this because I still get mail from tenants who no longer live here. I used the name of one of them who I happen to know moved to Mongolia(!) two years ago.&nbsp; ;-) Wish me luck!&nbsp; &nbsp;
