				Hello everyone!<br /><br />I must say, I am super excited about this site and forum. A good friend of mine, DoctorJayCSmith (find him on SR and here) told me about SR last week. He gets his guilty pleasure habits from SR and he loves it. However, while at his place comparing some pistols, I asked him if he knew where I could find a solid supplier as my demand has increased with all of the political gun control bull going on. People want guns and most of them are not able or willing to buy them through conventional means. Some of my clientele has &quot;obstacles&quot; that prevent them from purchasing in stores so they come to me, the local guy &quot;who can get guns&quot;. <br /><br />I understand that my NEW status will hinder me a bit but I&#039;m willing to work with the right person and establish a rapport and hopefully get&nbsp; a good stream of profitable business going between us. I thought I would give this a shot and see what I can do. <br /><br />Has anyone confirmed that TxRanger, TheArmsDepot and Synaptic are legit and not scammers? And please, someone explain to me what BMR is? Is there a URL to the site?<br /><br />If you can help and/or advise me, please email or PM me. Due to the nature of this business, please use encryption when emailing and do try to stay away from specifics outside of encrypted email. <br /><br />ohdark30@tormail.org<br /><br />My public key: <br />Thanks in advance. <br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQINBFEsQlUBEADCmon5twwKckRpjJ/gEz/xXxz1o+InyHqw73QESaNvfdx/7nsk<br />d2J4Pe/qqRcSFbrUicBCNpIrivVKnHP3Fo5oSlC8zNqnczwGhGYxjAIrPgtkHCCh<br />sDCgi+bw/xZ9TsNhxMJ3qTsFRVfuB8bORapfXzgWriN+XDLeCAsJQsTNHawDUWTh<br />KwAjcHBcUNUnpYDp5sZKHJmSOzx62dZDOVdQWuCvEGHtmlA1jHGRwwgzjinTXSBE<br />WvUhF8UcfU+RyX3E9ynqPbKbTIjUJvOdGmjQhC89Vr3oeY8J3yX9wwea8ZnZThiD<br />+OvBUSwgEnu2CSZZA4pFcZMHaKDxiv3xCR1dOhGbLfga4EYcvVzmpd2kTdAJftY/<br />iyc44HR2D9MByJ3gQmU1cA9TohUCgxaC/Xqwgw1ZuIA6HVu28dy9aTVwRpNcEvqt<br />creq3XpRMAoJ7DGZw1MvPAZjjewlTLjLZw+nJLuKPHG4o72T0Hmk7KWDXs6hoLEN<br />VvflkyXZyN8Y18mHLfnbqOwzDUDJ6pqxE6ntAsOFSvXmAUOlTgMJsJU+AyXzm0x/<br />xqXEECrF9lkswMutxVeMAhCEgGB2PXzjqLm774dGpJHjW5nNJb09jlICaippMkcg<br />jF2f1v4yo9/X5HbEID5HOXUu9biZYOfxt22METdjO1IJgE9uOBajmtCgUQARAQAB<br />tCBvaGRhcmtvbmUgPG9oZGFyazMwQHRvcm1haWwub3JnPokCPgQTAQIAKAUCUSxC<br />VQIbAwUJCWYOiwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQkhEJsIK6OBSd<br />IhAAmk68kzVn7dWjdekHYZlqo38h4dctac3z7HLVIr3DW0jxGXF1VYb+TV92Mzi7<br />vGgCziG8d7KUh0gWiSJ+WdU30SGZiIqB0HCXwt5ZOrvbHdihj7vLtiHkQ2pE3WkR<br />kFRQvxuKcUGNqb2zz3WeIWldmmfSyf/tiKt7sG1I2BiBPnw6OnShofQYaOPs89KR<br />eunqL8Tz9dn/QWTZuK4yDfJ2JVEvvjG6d7FU9gjFqF6NbWwKpO68uecxdn/QtlCM<br />hgGS79ppuA5sgSYxtTh3/kBA9hKYselAhK/yPGuKQaaLd4xesVTl9cOeI8cldQ+9<br />oACS+DtK7Nbta1S28cuft+IbnwGxm7g/XtYRwYJRkbypolfFKJahTWvfuxd92LMj<br />SXHh6UElEy2uyZFPOK4W/mrpinusHuYk2TVw8RZzo0drdyJKU8wkZ6BZtJ9EYlRT<br />p8VFYYKQTtjc0Uy5n6pVP559CxlodEV2UplPlzYkFger/PXUZfN8wJTUQCjCr5MM<br />QllnI1H5FdfkBDnvhowFGRXGq6Lt8yDgG+LCBNdx9RcAJP3eMKrEkxtAhVQRngIn<br />08gO9G+ZhWti12rT/9lwHkyZHwwV8S6z6fghHl4BlQY7rJk9OiqLC2JRhlqaFzuK<br />fRG902RqMzQrhD/PDuYEu7VIFnqM1sTqD3wVpaD2KuX+Gjy5Ag0EUSxCVQEQAPWS<br />kss4fJVM4NsdGuIHcRD99tZBtIvIYS7iM47FSVsvBmbyn6U7hgEJbHsi9xx3Fgl2<br />DK/w6b4po+QYg/eWqVmOuRLd8u+mTs768c5kes7WJ6pipFKZmy8lY5L2I03EBtz9<br />IKQDFFEcbkA4bwrMYuEjpHI4aFsyYBD14KBvDCRVnVx3O4a3lGM+0yd2+qhreZma<br />wszHQCLh6eUq4yw6k93ADuKrMQIjsv7U+u/DK6+/ruknZcSekmUG1LbjFzFSRaFe<br />KDCcj7TLLbvMO4CeSWJzoDfJJ+XU7PAc/eLfDcyMmBOod6Pf6OUQw7zosy8eOV6/<br />+nyljr/f8FacMNEa7MYXBDiQurCeag7ixJHWt8BF0jNA5Mv5xxl7L2m+X5fa66hp<br />deGXlGuGs1lAgz5itMAg1YIOA5sOAi6Phxr3RPZU2VofDY9+MdQ3chNPYPmJ/Qk0<br />5/F2gVGXT1p8ruxmI5SXlAtHZZVznArWp/i9m1UUZnCiBedpc0+caAA1goaho/If<br />d+bJ2Vs+TwCOju0idho3lHDzHthIXmG4tE1ZnX8M3q2o5SmrKWJAoSCMAHcmrZUR<br />de+uBCVZpyyRXCjPjWA8N987HCZJIOeQFcJWGWE5YQxaa7EjfRWpAhH7UI8VR/ut<br />7RUw68nlaNqlPUSxUaY1ZaJdhhTNP1QbsB1GqCzVABEBAAGJAiUEGAECAA8FAlEs<br />QlUCGwwFCQlmDosACgkQkhEJsIK6OBRflxAArO3hxSTcFb3TyJlETdLIu4UvVjT9<br />kZrsjviaNHI8JBbniUaorLGz5Nr7kPQf3IjqFY8+DUZY4oOAJrZR6bzhAJnm7KzX<br />TINyzIKj8v06NNo1ux6SVlXfiUIW5c22UVauZ/szBi3qk5iiYPsBxJLiFTqhCiL/<br />faDfUR/GCHTynBNqWWn8zm5NcuDRYkggAmvckpHECX2UQK1p+Mi1KQ+QGhZhg9Hj<br />XtHno1As5RaP6nap9CYE+ibEvkj9m9KaA3EksJC8CQ08eRpLFDK24mZ/CBlK2col<br />pzYBwXgtRYDh1niSxVbziyQbPNVziJgOIjcmP5qNKC/GJcBOdZD+0vMC1IxGE3rL<br />FFmEzEfvSFZmIj34NAD+nSq15JBWMCsKHfKUolPCMaoykVfRoDtOCBYuRyyqobAp<br />GB3iSkgQDdQHkd7+5+6Do3PYv4a7V7WAsxEBG/L+HK77Qr07BUFnlUJ9HZHx5GYs<br />WepZLHi9U5Uk8wwIMaeOxOMJIUraFS9yMoE3a9xYJptOvKLH58AK/vR52GwVWvd5<br />wNDSdN53Dj9iL4+wY+M2OyQG7FC245dvOKR5q3UP0JCebQI9/SqNLi1JqZx85cPz<br />tw2LUQllhxRgnHBxRMhcz33XfQsCNCs4OfuioxppSZipxVLXWnoH8b/OiANe9DFO<br />R2uAOIMnUUTgxMw=<br />=yK6Y<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />Anyways,

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages. I pointed out that their Site was the same as &#039;Executive Outcomes&#039; (EO) and they posted a disclaimer that they had nothing to do with them immediately.<br />&nbsp;<br />They said a tracking number would be provided in 7-12 days- so they have around a week and half to prove this. But I am not hopeful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also wrote to Executive Outcomes- and only got this in reply- &quot;Thanks another scam&quot;. They are identical to AD, just look jazzier.<br />&nbsp;<br />For example, just look at the spelling mistake on both sites: http://imwvq3drst5zens6.onion/index.php ... er=product on EO and on http://2ousn6z3qfxvcv7t.onion/ArmsDepot ... oductID=84 on AD. It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites??? Smells very fishy to me.<br /><br />Luckily I placed a very small order on AD I could afford to lose. Losing money is losing money- but the lesson is worth it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bests<br />Shenobie

Number two, i don&#039;t think i ever said that i had a problem getting guns. In fact, i&#039;m pretty sure i said that i am the &quot;guy who can get guns&quot;. so all of these silly suggestions are unsolicited. Guns are very easy to get in America and just about anywhere else in the world. Duh, thats why we have SR and the deepweb. <br />The reason i asked SR in the first place is because i&#039;m obviously a newb here. initially I thought the comraderie amongst users here was unanimous but now I see that smartasses and dumbasses exist everywere...even in the deep web. its unfortunate.<br /><br />I&#039;m no child, but believe it or not, thats when we all learned to play with guns.

WHY CAN&#039;T OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SOMEONE BUY ONE IN A STORE? WHY NOT A GUN SHOW? GUNS ARE VERY EASY TO GET IN AMERICA AND I THINK YOU ARE A CHILD.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe for you guns are easy to get.&nbsp; But not for everyone in America.&nbsp; I am one of those people with many &quot;obstacles&quot; in place in which i cannot legally own a gun in America any longer.&nbsp; Some people just dont have as easy access to firearms as some people do.&nbsp; Especially if you are in an urban area, then prices skyrocket and things become harder to get.&nbsp; Now if you are in a rural area, then yes, sometimes guns are about as easy to come across as a 6 pack of beer at the local supermarket....<br /><br />if you dont have anything worth while to add to this thread then why not just keep you mouth shut?&nbsp; You, my friend, are the one who sounds like a child.&nbsp; So you impose your CAPS LOCK TO TRY AND GET YOUR POINT ACROSS???... or what??
