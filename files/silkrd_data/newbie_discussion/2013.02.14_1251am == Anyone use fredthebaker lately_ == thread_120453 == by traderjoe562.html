				Are you in the US?&nbsp; He still offers 100% refund for Indian orders.&nbsp; I had a couple breeze through US customs and the last order was seized in India not US, which he promptly refunded.&nbsp; Are you speaking of US or Indian customs seizing the package

				No, Im talking about the Netherlands. Dutch customs are seizing them since they don&#039;t allow import of specific meds from India. Had the same problem ordering from generics from an Indian online-pharmacy, those packages were marked &quot;medicine/heath products&quot; which makes it easy for customs to find what they are looking for. So I think if the packaging is stealthy enough that even if customs open it, but don&#039;t see the meds right away, it will get through.

				I&#039;ve also been looking into fredthebaker, But it seems he has less listings now. But i&#039;m still interested in his valium. So his packages get opened by customs all the time? <br />I wonder how his success rate is now.

				I have had good luck with him in the past he was 3 for 4 shipping to the US and the package that never made it was an India issue.&nbsp; Fred promptly refunded the money.&nbsp; He claims to be up and running and my package is tracking in the system, will update when i get it

				My shipment is having trouble getting out of India at the moment.&nbsp; Per the trackers its been stuck there the 22nd.&nbsp; Fred is looking into it and I am 100% sure he will make things right because that is how he has handled issues in the past.&nbsp; The wait is inconvenient but I like having a vendor I can trust, Fred I know you got my back!&nbsp; I will update this thread with total transit time once I get the package.&nbsp; I know this might sound slightly negative but I am still a huge fan of Fred and understand that logistically problems happen that are out of his hands.

				I&#039;m planning on making an order from fredthebaker here soon. I figure that even if the package gets seized and I (hopefully) get a 50% refund, I could order a second package and it would still be cheaper than buying domestic. Of course there&#039;s always the issue of how close to the advertised strength the pills actually are. I&#039;ve heard stories of Indian generics being as low as half potency, but I see no reason to doubt the quality of his products since he seems to get great reviews. And even at half potency, they&#039;re on par (if not cheaper) than domestics - win/win in my book.

				Anyone ever order his MDMA? I have 250g order and I had to finalize part a last week.. And part b is still processing. He&#039;s been very prompt with his responses, he says his re shippers from NL will have it ready by this week. I just wanna know if anybody else has had any success with his MDMA orders.

				Anyone used fred for Benzos? I have some Alprazolam and Clonazepam and I can&#039;t feel any effects from them at all. I usually feel 1-2 anax, but I took 2 strips (20) of his Xanax, and I don&#039;t feel anythinh. Anyone else with similar experiences? Is there any way to get money back if you&#039;r sure the item is fake? I mean, this can&#039;t be allowed can it? No wonder his prices are so cheap, they are knockoffs,

				I have had a good experience with fred. However i WOULD NOT FE. its just good practice when there is skepticism regarding a vendor. also on a serious side not if you are looking for pills especially Xanax i would strongly recommended AmericanPsycho. A little extra money goes a long way towards ensuring QUICK honest delivery.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Well I ordred 1 g of valium powder&nbsp; the other day, no gripes with packagiong, security etc, I was about 20 mg under, that was including the inner bag, not a big deal, but one gets so spoiled on SR with vendors adding a dab more, that one tends to get spoiled. First time I used it, I was ultra careful as I have zero tolerance, didn&#039;t do too much, tried a bit more on the end of a knife blade, got a bit more of a hit, decided fuck it, and took a big scoop, now thathad me bouncing off the walls a little, but considering I had had at least 0.25 g, ie, about 25 *10 mg tablets, I should have been semi comotose- IF THAT WAS GENUINE PURE VALIUM POWDER. I mean, over 30 years I have had enough experience of drugs, including valium to know what is real and what is fake, and what is just damned diluted, FredtheBakers valium is definitely not pure- at least, the order he sent me (my first order from him, by the way- draw your own conclusions!). I am really tempted to take it to resolution!

				Hi..<br /><br />I have used him twice, well..<br />First time it was underweight (250mg&#039;s) of 2grams.<br />And now I ordered 5grams like a week ago or more.<br /><br />NOTHING has arrived, until 2-3 days ago.. so around 15businessdaya..(uk-scandinavia)<br />So everything I did wrote about before isn&#039;t true because Freds product finally arrived.<br />And from my experience it&#039;s very pure, at least the one I received.<br />To write 5g on the bottom on the address, after my country wasn&#039;t that clever but hey shit happens.<br />it&#039;s a miracle it made it&#039;s way here I must say.<br />Overall: 4.5/5.<br /><br />I would use Fred again, but you need to take security very seriously in the future!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />sS<br />(This message is modified because it took forever for me to get the product, but it wasn&#039;t Freds fault).

				Yeah!<br />I have used him recently, and all that I can say is that fred is ok, and if some of you read my other stupid thread about me talking that fred could be an selective scammer... THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE! Fredthebaker is 100% LEGIT.. Everything is solved, it wasn&#039;t fred&#039;s fault because of the post office dealing very slowly with packages sometimes it seems.<br /><br />So my experience from dealing with fred is all good!<br />I would recommend him for anyone,<br />To fredthebaker: im sorry for all the problems i&#039;ve may caused for you and you&#039;re business.<br /><br />That&#039;s all folks! :)<br />fred is legit!<br />
