				Ill go ahead and post the first review here. I&#039;ve had several orders with Deezletime over the past 6 weeks. He is easily the best vendor I have ordered from in the year and a half I&#039;ve been on the road.<br />Overall I give DT a 5/5 with every order I&#039;ve placed with him.<br /><br />Communication- communication with DT has been great he has always made sure to reply to every message sent. Also he has had no problems answering the questions I have had. Any problems that I have had with an order I&#039;ve contacted him about and he has always messages me back and promptly fixed the problem.<br /><br />Shipping- best stealth I have seen on the road. First package I ever received from him I didn&#039;t even know was a silkroad package. It&#039;s that good. Shipping has always been lightening fast with my orders.<br /><br />Product- product has been great. Bags have always been on the lighter side but has been strong. Also he has always thrown in free bags with every order. Stamp bags are different week to week pretty much but are always good.<br /><br />I would recommend DT as a vendor to anyone looking for heroin.

				I am truly disappointed with my experience with Deezletime. The most frustrating thing at this point is is refusal to respond to any of my messages although they have been read. I ordered&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Coast Style Heroin Stamps x10 (3 FREE!!!) late June 4th. I sent him a message shortly after asking how many bags I could get for the $30 remaining in my account. DT informed me that I should order 2 singles and he would send 4 obviously including this in the package I already paid express for. Much to my delight the package did arrive the very next day. Upon counting the bags I was short 4. Honest mistake. I sent a message before even sampling the product letting him know about the issue. I have yet to receive a reply as of 6/8. <br /><br />This was my first time trying H although I have developed a 300mg IV Roxicodone dependance. I expected 3 bags to have me pretty high. Nothing. No rush I have heard about that is associated with IV H. Nothing. I thought maybe I just pulled out some weak bags and proceeded to load up 2 more. Nothing. This coutinued until I was left with 1 bag and much disappointment. I so wanted this stuff to even be mediocre. I am wondering if it was even active at all. I would attribute whatever effects I felt to the 2 Roxi 30s I did when I woke up earlier in the day. <br /><br />The very poor quality of my shipment left me wondering if I even got the same bags as everyone else leaving 5 star reviews. The bags said &quot;Money Time&quot; or something close to it in green font. This is not my major issue though. I can chalk the quality. My primary concern is that he seems to be taking his time simply sending a brief message &quot;My apologies for your short order. I am getting your missing bags in the mail ASAP&quot;. That&#039;s it. I would have been satisfied and released payment from escrow. It&#039;s just mind boggling to me why he seems to be avoiding what could be a minor issue. I will update if/when there are any developments with this issue.<br /><br />Edit: I forgot to mention that I expected the bags to be somewhat short but there were a few bags that had nothing or very next to nothing AT ALL. Again I can live with all of this but no communication is a deal breaker for me.

				Wow this is my first time ordering with this vendor and I had a great experience!!!<br />I ordered around 10:30 AM on a Friday morning and I paid for express shipping. About 6 or 7 hours later, on Friday afternoon, Deezletime messaged me to let me know that my package was expected to arrive on Saturday around noon. By 10:00 the next morning my mailman dropped off the mail in our mail slot and I looked thru and was dissapointed to see that my heroin was not there. I turned around to go get my laptop to message deezletime and I saw out of the corner of my eye the mailman coming back up the steps to leave another letter in my mailbox. It turned out to be my deezletime package :)<br />It took just 23 hours from the time&nbsp; I ordered til I was holding it in my hands!!<br />Communication was great and shipping was quick and stealth was fanfuckintastic! Stealth was overkill for a domestic package but I guess its always better to be safe :)<br />Bags look a little light, but I guess its probably because theyre not as cut up as other bags that i get off the street.<br />UPDATE, I just tried one bag and i&#039;m feeling great!<br />(I usually need half a bag up 2 bags to feel good, so this is a little better than average quality).<br />Overall very smooth transaction, I would definitely do business again!

				Has anyone ordered from Deezle today or yesterday? I guess he just got back from vacation, but he&#039;s not responding to any messages. Which is unlike him. Just weird shit going on with him and Terabithia, which are my fav 2 vendors .

				This was my first order on SR and it went smoothly. Ordered 2 bundles express 7/30.&nbsp; Received 33 bags 8/1. So it took 2 days for express, no big deal. Yeah the bags are on the light side, but I expected that from reading the product description and the reviews. I really don&#039;t get people complaining about the size of the bags when he pretty much tells you on the vendor page that they&#039;re small. Deezletime helped me test my pgp before I ordered and was very friendly about it, so that was pretty cool. He could&#039;ve said I don&#039;t have time for non-order bullshit. Product arrived in good condition, was sealed but easy enough to get into. The dope itself is decent, nothing mind blowing, but a hell of a lot cleaner than the local dope and it sure beats running the streets looking for bags that aren&#039;t any better. One thing I don&#039;t like, and this is for SR as a whole, is that the vendors don&#039;t allow you to give an honest rating. It&#039;s always &quot;Leave a 5 or you&#039;ll be blacklisted.&quot; Seems to me that the whole community would benefit from an honest rating system. I mean when you see a 5/5 where someone didn&#039;t get their shit and got no money back that&#039;s fucked up. Right? In this case I would&#039;ve left a 5 anyway, but I&#039;m just saying...&nbsp; Anyway, would I buy again? Probably. I do think I&#039;m gonna order a whole gram from a different vendor next time just to see whats out there.

				It&#039;s been awhile since I reviewed Deezletime&#039;s stuff. I was the first customer to order from him, so I keep him near and dear to my heart :)<br /><br />I placed an order for a bundle plus 3 with him on Thursday, right after his official cut-off time. He *still* got it in the mail that day. It arrived about 20 minutes ago, along with an order I placed on Aug 3rd. Both shipped priority from the same area. Who knows why USPS takes so long from some area codes and not others.<br /><br />Anyway, Deez&#039;s stealth was great - he used one of those anti-smell bags and the whole envelope looked very inconspicuous. There were 13 stamp bags - all were about the same weight from my eying them.<br /><br />I snorted a bag of this stuff about 45 minutes ago. I feel fantastic and I&#039;ve got a nice nod going on. I normally have a high tolerance, but I&#039;ve been cutting fown on it sithat I&#039;d feel this stuff. <br /><br />Deez should be considered the gold standard when it comes to customer service. Always does what he can to make the customer happy. Order from him, tell him saranottegan sent you - you won&#039;t be disappointed!

				i&#039;ve ordered from deezle a couple times now. he&#039;ll probably become my go-to h vendor. his prices are good, his product is strong, his shipping is quick, and he includes freebies (those listed and sometimes extra extras). <br /><br />so far my experience has been express comes the next day, as long as your put your order in early enough in the day. has everyone else had this experience.<br /><br />i placed an express order late last night and its still listed as &quot;processing&quot;. i cant remember if he takes a little bit to update to &quot;in transit&quot;. i&#039;d love it if my package arrived tomorrow :) so far that&#039;s how its played out so it&#039;ll probably play out that way again :) <br /><br />frankly im sick of the dope scene in my area. its gone deep underground; no open market stuff. so i get stuck with middle men you either cut, or have sticky fingers, or just straight up burn you. but finding a good dope connect in my area is tough. leo has pushed it down pretty well. so ive turned to SR as a solution to the annoying dope game up here in NE. so far so good :) biggest problem is getting BTC in my account quickly.

				DT came thru for me, once again.<br /><br />Speed- Excellent, priority mail. about 42ish hours from placing order to package in hand.<br /><br />Communication - Excellent , hell, I had the old pgp key, within about 10 minutes , or less, of placing ,my order I had a PM letting me know that he couldn&#039;t decrypt my addy. This order was put in late in the day as well, DT got it in transit for me where lotsa guys would have done it in the AM.<br /><br />Quantity - Ordered 4 stamps, got 6 and the size on mine seemed to get a bit bigger than the last time I ordered from DT<br /><br />Quality -Nice, no complaints a all. Nice euphoric high and I think it&#039;s a definite improvement over last time, and , the last time was good too.<br /><br />Stealth - Made me chuckle, very good stealth ;-)<br /><br />Customer service??? - Top Freakin Notch<br /><br />Thanks Deezletime!!!!!<br />Much appreciated my friend!
