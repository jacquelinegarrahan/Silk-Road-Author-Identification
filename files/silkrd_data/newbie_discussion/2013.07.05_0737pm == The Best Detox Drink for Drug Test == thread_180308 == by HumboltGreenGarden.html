				If it&#039;s weed you&#039;re trying to detox from, save your money. The only way to remove THC from your body fat is with time and exercise.<br />Detox drinks work on the same principle as dilution. Which doesn&#039;t remove THC from the body, it just reduces the concentration of THC metabolites in the urine for a couple hours... you can do that with just plain water and a bunch of&nbsp; B12 so your urine has some color.<br />The&nbsp; most fool proof method I&#039;ve found is to use someones clean piss ( I believe you can also buy clean dehydrated urine that you can reconstitute in water as well).<br />What worked for me was putting the clean urine in a condom. Then I&#039;d activate and tape one of those &quot;6 hour hand warmer&quot; things you can get in the sporting goods isle around the condom. That will keep the urine above 98 degrees. I would usually just crotch the whole thing, but there was this one facility that made you do a couple jumping jacks before they sent me in the bathroom. So I have been forced to strap it to my leg with some surgical tape as well. <br />A word of advice if you&#039;re going to try this method. Do a practice run before you go in. It seems pretty straight forward, but it&#039;s actually an awkward procedure that&#039;s a bit harder to master than it might seem. Coming out of the bathroom covered in piss is probably the wrong time to realize you should have worked out the fine point of transferring piss from a condom to a test cup before being tested on the topic.<br />A couple of things I learned the hard way was to make sure to take something to pierce the condom with (I would usually carry a pair of fingernail clippers with me in the coin pocket of my jeans) and the other is to make sure you roll up the condom in such a way that you get all of the urine out of it before you put it in your pocket and leave the room... Oh and if you have hairy legs, try not to make too much noise pulling the tape off you thigh!&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)
