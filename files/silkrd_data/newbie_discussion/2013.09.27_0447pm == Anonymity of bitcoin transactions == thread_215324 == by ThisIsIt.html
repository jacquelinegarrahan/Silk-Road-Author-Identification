				While all bitcoin transactions are written to the blockchain, and therefore public, how anonymous are the orders for the transaction?<br /><br />Let&#039;s say I&#039;ve got some anonymous bitcoins (i.e. deposited there by a mixing service) in Address1 in my Electrum wallet. And I want to use these bitcoins in &quot;my_Address1&quot; to anonymously pay for a VPN service. Would it be clear/visible that the order to send coins from my_Address1 to the VPN_Address came from my computer?<br /><br /><br />

				IMO people are far too paranoid (not that you can ever be &quot;too safe&quot;) SR actually launders the money when you send it anyways, and to top it off if you&#039;re only sending yourself fractions of bitcoins especially to offline wallets, then who&#039;s going to seriously want to go through all the trouble of going through those thousands of layers and tracing it back to some noobie buyer using shit for personal measures? I think they are FAR more concerned about catching the vendors, and people buying ENORMOUS amounts off SR and even then LE and PI&#039;s have to go through an excruciating process and receive multiple warrants to do anything about anything.

				I agree that small buyers are probably at a smaller risk, but my question is more about the nature of bitcoin exchanges. <br /><br />How does my &quot;wallet&quot; communicate with the blockchain? I assumed since the blockchain is public, it is also visible who is writing to the blockchain? Perhaps I need to do more basic nature into the mechanics of bitcoin. <br /><br />

Mt Gox, for example, requires a clearnet login and they record every IP address, the amount of coins purchased by that IP and where they sent the btc. So if you&#039;re going the exchange rate route, you have to spoof your IP if you want anonymity. I&#039;ve never tried logging in to GOx through tor, but my understanding is that triggers a verification requirement. I know most of the exchanges have the same policy; I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s strictly enforced.<br /><br />Why not just bypass the exchanges all together and use localbitcoins.net?Edit: localbitcoins.com. Sorry I fucked that up!

So to the average everyday user, the coins in address 1 probably aren&#039;t all that anonymous.

				Jesus if you cant read the question dont answer <br /><br />The ip addresses on blockchain are the relays and not the senders, I do recommend tumbling coins after purchace no matter how you bought them but to answer the question NO they cant tell what computer/ip sent the coin the only thing they can do is track them back to the purchase

Two parties still need IP addresses to communicate, therefore they both can &quot;know&quot; each other&#039;s IPs. The IPs can still be logged at both ends of the transactions.<br /><br />I trust you can carry on now.<br /><br />good luck,<br /><br />Kilroy

				I think I figured out my question. Since IPs can be linked to transactions, the IP can be anonymized through TOR. Since I&#039;m using Electrum, followed the advice in this thread<br /><br />clearnet: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=113116.0;all<br /><br />So basically, the &quot;network&quot; settings allow you to choose how to connect to the bitcoin network, instead of the default server I am connecting through a TOR network.<br /><br />
