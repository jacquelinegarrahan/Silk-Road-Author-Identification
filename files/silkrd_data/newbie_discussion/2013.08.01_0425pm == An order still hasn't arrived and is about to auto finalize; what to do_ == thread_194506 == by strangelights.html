				An order I placed a while back was returned to the vendor because he didn&#039;t use enough postage.&nbsp; He offered to either cancel the order or resend it with some extra product to make up for the delay.&nbsp; I asked him to resend it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried that it&#039;s taken a while, as his communication has been very good and the whole situation seems reasonable.&nbsp; However, if the resent order doesn&#039;t arrive in the next couple days, my order will auto finalize, which would be bad for my stats.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to finalize before it arrives and I&#039;m not sure how the &quot;resolve&quot; button works, especially when the vendor&#039;s communication has been so good and nothing really needs resolved yet.

				Use that resolve button, it will give you the option to extend the shipping time.

				SealTeam6 is correct; you should click on the &quot;resolve&quot; link - it&#039;s always better than letting the order autofinalize.
