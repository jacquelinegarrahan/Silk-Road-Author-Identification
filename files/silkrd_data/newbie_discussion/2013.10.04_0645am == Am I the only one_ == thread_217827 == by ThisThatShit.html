				I think that story that was on the news about the 14 year kid buying MDMA was bullshit, I mean what else is better then to have a actor play a mom who&#039;s son bought drugs from SR that will put all of the angry parents behind the DEA, FBI or whoever to try to eliminate such online markets, idk maybe I&#039;m wrong, but why does a 14 year old need with bitcoins, I mean if it was a game they thought he was buying, why not just go to gamestop and get it for the little fucker, the fuck are you buying bitcoins for him for?

				Lol when I was young I could probably have gotten my parents to buy me bitcoins - they bought me salvia thinking it was &#039;plant fertilizer&#039; - let me use their credit card to get packages delivered.&nbsp; I think anything about SR is postable and worthy of at least someone&#039;s time...I didn&#039;t see the story you were looking at but anything&#039;s plausible at this point.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting for the feds to come knocking at my door, &quot;Hmm yes excuse me sir it says your name is FuckLE...and this is the address we have on record for you...and here are some messages you sent to vendors unencrypted...hmm yes...hmm&quot;&nbsp; Then I can tell them about how my long lost son raised in china from sperm I donated when I hit puberty grew into a superhacker and stole my debit card to pay for bitcoins and buy DMT which taught him the meaning of life and since he used my name and address for the deliveries, ultimately led him to me where we resolved a great deal of our problems.&nbsp; This they would surely buy and sell to news crews.<br /><br />Also the fact that I deal strictly not with black markets, but with white markets...in the sperm trade...this is getting ever-more-plausible by the minute.
