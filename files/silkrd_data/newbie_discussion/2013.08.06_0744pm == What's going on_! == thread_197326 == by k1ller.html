				It can take several hours, especially if you didn&#039;t include a TX-fee to pay the miners for moving your coins.&nbsp; Just have patience, they will show up.

				That&#039;s completely separate from the TX-fee to pay the miners on the BTC network.&nbsp; I might suggest you go do a little reading on how the Bitcoin network works.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ll mention that transferring BTC from a site that has your identity linked to it, straight to SR is an extremely bad idea.&nbsp; You need to wash those coins before moving them to the road somehow.&nbsp; There is lots of information on these forums for new people to educate themselves, take a few hours/days and read up.

				Transferring coins into SR usually takes around 6 hours on average for me. It could be less, it could be more. Wait about a day at least before contacting SR staff or anything.

				Normally it takes a few hours. Check your deposit address at blockexplorer or blockchain, once it hits six confirmations, then it should show up in your SR account within an hour or two.

				Yeah, it&#039;s always a good idea to take extra care. :)<br /><br />Anyway, like k1ller I was a bit nervous that something went wrong the first time I transfered money to my SR account because of the time it took. Then I noticed there&#039;s is a cake-diagram in my wallet-program that shows the completion of a transfer, a nice feature.
