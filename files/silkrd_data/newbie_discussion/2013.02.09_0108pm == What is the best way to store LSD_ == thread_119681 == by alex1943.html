				Away from light, moisture and temperature fluctuations. Heat too is bad, but the fridge is not a very good solution. A book can be a pretty good spot.

				I&#039;ve always kept it in a big book on a part of the shelf that doesn&#039;t ever get warmed by the sun. Don&#039;t usually store for more than a few days though

Just keep it in a place where temperate is stable and there is no light. A book could be a good example, or some sort of box you have laying somewhere. :)

				It should stay fine if you vacuum-bag it and keep it in the deep freezer. Split it into small portions so you only have to take out what you intend to use.<br />&nbsp;I have a batch of Shiva-blotters and they have not lost potency in 4 years this way.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Thats a good way to go. Bought myself a vacuumizer years ago for 10 bucks in the net. <br /><br />Since that, vacuum-seal the goodies, and let them sleep in the freezer ... works like a charm for years, as the poster b4 me stated.<br /><br /><br />as for the party-thing: u might recognize, that runnin&#039; around a party and sellin&#039; tabs is not the same like selling a pill.... startig with a proper packaging. u will find some more obstacles on that way.... but its possible.<br />just treat the substance with respect, as well as the customers. inform. its powerful. and lovely :)
