				The subreddit just seems like a bad idea in general.<br /><br />We have these forums for a reason. Any discussion of SR should be left off the clearnet.<br /><br />That&#039;s like talking about doing a drug deal on the bus super loud. It&#039;s just plain ignorant. <br /><br />Just our two BTC...

				I&#039;ve looked through the subreddit, and I refrained from posting for all the security reasons mentioned above, but I did find some extremely clear and well-expressed how-to guides there that I found very helpful.&nbsp; The &quot;how to buy bitcoins anonymously&quot; one in particular was very, very useful to me.&nbsp; (For the interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/16ua3n/a_step_by_step_guide_for_newbies_who_want/)&nbsp; I would have tripped up so many times in CVS if I hadn&#039;t read that.&nbsp; It might not be necessary to buy BC under an alias, but I enjoyed it all the same.&nbsp; They had some good vendor comparisons also.&nbsp; So while what they&#039;re doing is certainly unwise, they actually helped me out a lot.&nbsp; You just won&#039;t catch me posting a thank you anytime soon.&nbsp; So if any of you are Redditors.... THANKS GUYS!

				I&#039;ve thought the same thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned some things from /r/silkroad and seem some good vendor info, but I feel a little nervous about buying from some of the vendors I&#039;ve seen reviewed on there.&nbsp; My fear is that LE will take note of this and try and target them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they will come after me as a buyer but I&#039;m afraid the vendor will get busted or tracked and my name might get put on a list that will cause me troubles later on.

				It&#039;s Darwin&#039;s theory writ large is my guess.<br /><br />Even though they have been hit by the stupid stick, you have to admit that if it helps to normalise it then it makes it easier to push for decriminalisation because it moves it from a sub culture to the everyday.&nbsp; Or at least that would be the theory if it were a better class of mouth breathers.&nbsp; (call me harsh, I know!)

				I agree that most of what is said there is very very stupid...<br /><br />Some of the guides are nice, and it&#039;s great having faster reloads on vendor reviews, but it seems kind of ridiculous to go through all the effort to establish a secure connection to SR, remain anonymous, and then use your ip on a clearnet site discussing your hidden activities.<br /><br />I wonder how many people have encrypted usb drives to access tor, and keep internet explorer open to reddit and post in that sub at the same time ?!?

				I only use TOR to browse to /r/silkroad&nbsp; A few times I&#039;ve been tempted to chime in on a discussion, but the effort to create a throwaway account, with another password to keep around is too much.&nbsp; Better to just keep to here.
