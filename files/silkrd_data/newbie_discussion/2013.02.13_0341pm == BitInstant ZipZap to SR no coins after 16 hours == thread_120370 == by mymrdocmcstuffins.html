				I am new at this, so I may have said it in the wrong order.<br /><br />I go to BitInstant; chose local deposit location to bitcoin address option; I enter my SR wallet address, amount, and other info;&nbsp; it then creates a MoneyGram bill pay form payable to ZipZap, I then take my cash and go to a local MoneyGram location and submit the MoneyGram bill pay payment. I received email confirmation of the transaction. The first time the coins were credited to my account within 2 hours.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used BI -&gt; SR BTC Wallet Address to fund mySR account on 5 different occaisions and two things have been consistent:<br /><br />1) I get a confirmation email from BitInstant (usually before Zipzap) that they&#039;ve received the funds and they&#039;ve been sent out.<br />2) I get the funds in my SR account usually about an hour later - depending on how busy it is.<br /><br />Check your address for your SR Wallet??<br /><br />Email BitInstant - their customer service sucks for the most part (from what I&#039;ve heard), but I read that email is the fastest.&nbsp; They&#039;re based in NYC and they &#039;close&#039; at 5, I think...<br /><br />Good Luck!

				I always send my coins from Gox to another wallet then to SR. This may be over-paranoia but I&#039;ve never had any trouble doing it that way. I just know Gox would sell you out in a second if they caught on to the coins going to an SR wallet. I wish bitinstant still had the bank deposit option. I used to go in their bank and with no ID or name required I&#039;d make a deposit into their acct and have my coins within an hr after that. I just did it yesterday with stupid ass zip zap and had no trouble but I was asked for a name to do the moneygram transfer. Me no likey.

				I totally agree. I hadn&#039;t purchased any coins in a while and the other day when I did it bitinstant had changed everything up. Now I&#039;m looking for a new more anonymous method. I hate to do the freakin&#039; moneypak method but there are some serious traders on here now that have been doing it for a long time. Seems like I may have to switch. Anyone else have any ideas?? Quick anonymous way to get my coins onto Gox. I&#039;m all ears...

				im in the same boat guys, i went yesterday and did a money gram and i got the emails from zip zap and i made 2 deposits, cause one was over 500 and the one that was 200 i got a email from bitinstant and i go to coinapult it and thers 0 in the account...<br />i emailed bitinstant few times already and all they have said they have to manual transfer the coins and also they have contacted coinapult... this is so bad on there part i found a new coin supplier this is from<br />&nbsp;fredflintstone where to get coins- and many others on the road<br /><br />I am personally recommending the BTC seller Cryptocurrent.<br /><br />Located at https://www.cryptocurrent.com ... currently developing the site, almost done. For now, can be reached - info@cryptocurrent.com<br /><br />Accept US bank deposits, no questions asked, no BitInstant ID bullshit<br /><br />Good rates, always reliable.<br /><br />I will personally guarantee this persons services !!!

				Except I can beat that- I&#039;d like to look at several years/months worth of reviews. Is this person on SR as a coin seller? I would never deposit cash into an acct without some serious research and reviews behind it. I&#039;m not making any assertions about this person&#039;s integrity, but there is just too much bullshit happening here. The moneypak to BTC scam is the biggest one going on SR, and has been for the almost 3 years I&#039;ve known about this site. Bitinstant has started to suck but if that&#039;s the best I got, I gotta go with it.

				My first time using bitinstant I had an issue, but it had nothing to do with them. The person operating the money gram stuff sent my payment as a money order, rather than using the bill pay option.&nbsp; I wonder if that happened with other people?&nbsp; My last transactions with bitinstant were fine.&nbsp; I usually go from bit instant to btc address, usually one of my blockchain.info wallets, then I anonymously send it through a couple other wallets, THEN to sr.

				That&#039;s all well and fine, but I don&#039;t like the fact that I have to give my name when I send the Moneygram. I could give a fake, but if something were to go wrong then I may not be able to retrieve my money if I have to show an ID. I found another way to do a bank deposit today, but they want 27 for a coin, whereas the going rate is about 24 last I looked. Gonna keep the search going...

				If you&#039;re using BitInstant, you can&#039;t be buying THAT much in BTC - which last I checked, is still legal (and a great investment over the last few months).&nbsp; If you really ARE that paranoid, you&#039;re fucked because with the blockchain, the movement can be traced (as I understand it), but you would have to be buying enough for LE to really give a shit?&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they&#039;re going to do all of this cyberinvestigation over a measly 15 BTC or however much you are buying.&nbsp; On top of everything, if you are really using the software correctly and using a flash drive to boot from AND with the tumbling that SR does for you, it is highly doubtful that you&#039;ll be sought after over your purchase of bitcoin.&nbsp; Your biggest concern should be delivery/shipping of the product -- even then, they&#039;re not interested in locking you up for a gram or three of any product on here - especially if they know that they can&#039;t get any reliable info from them.<br /><br />As for the original complaint - good luck to you bud, their customer service sucks, but, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re that interested in stealing your money, but I would make sure you get the best conversion rate for your money (either then or now, whichever is better for you)...

				I&#039;ve used them for smaller amounts (&lt;$200) about 5 times (including right now) - and it usually takes about an hour from when the moneygram is done at CVS to when the BTC shows up in my SR wallet.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really paranoid and I use my real ID and my SR wallet address.&nbsp; Like I said before, the real risk is receiving the gear.<br /><br />Best of luck!<br /><br />EDIT: Checked blockchain - the transfer was almost instantaneous (within 4 minutes), but it took SR 2 hours to verify - I&#039;m going to make an order - see ya!!

				I just feel bad because you paid for the coins and I&#039;m hoping you don&#039;t get screwed out of some money due to the exchange rate fluctuations.&nbsp; Plus, there is absolutely ZERO reason that a service as large as bitinstant should take THIS LONG to get someone their coins.&nbsp; Plus, their support flat out sucks.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not mean of you to want what you paid for.&nbsp; Also, they guarantee that if the mistake is on their side, they will refund you the 4% fee as well .... but, yet again, they don&#039;t always offer this unless you bring it to their attention that they said they&#039;d do it.&nbsp; A little bit shady, in my opinion.<br /><br />

				Hey guys/girls I should say this. Please , PLEASE make sure that when you are at the counter doing money grams that they include the TOTAL AMOUNT ON THE PAPER that zip zap gives you when utilizing bitinstant. I had a nightmare at an ACME. Where the clerks get confused is: they think its gonna require a fee to send. If you look at zip zaps form the fee is added into everything. If you send only the amount you need on your silk road, in my case 50, instead of 50+ the 3.99 fee, you will have a fkn nightmare be ware. Im not sure if this is where BTC is comin up missing but its good to point out IMO.<br /><br />Also bitinstant today doesnt have the bitcoin to email option avail. so obviously theres some probs out there<br /><br />** Update as of 10:15 EST USA. --- ZIPZAP IS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE

				Greets all,<br /><br />I deposited some cash day before yesterday at about 1730EST, and while zipzap confirmed, bitinstant never did.&nbsp; Bitinstant said it would be cleared up in a day, and then yesterday they said they&#039;d do it as soon as they could.&nbsp; I emailed them just now and asked them to refund the processing fee, and I don&#039;t know where that&#039;s going to go.&nbsp; Basically, the same problem everyone else is having.<br /><br />As far as using real info, I mean, maybe some senior SR user can correct me here, but what&#039;s the point?&nbsp; Encrypt your BTC address, never use the same one for very long, and you won&#039;t have a problem.&nbsp; Law enforcement is not going to be able to tie your BTC address to a payment for drugs, even if they can tie your cash to a BTC address.&nbsp; It&#039;s really that simple.&nbsp; Besides that, they&#039;re more worried about trying to trace their own payments back to the sellers&#039; (because that&#039;s how narcs operate - they buy drugs from you, and you go to jail; it&#039;s just about the only tune they know how to play).&nbsp; So, you can take off the tinfoil hats and pop a xanax.&nbsp; Chill out.

				As soon as I get home after going to my cash deposit spot using ZipZap/MoneyGram, I immediately check on Blockchain if there is any inbound BTC. If there isn&#039;t, and the ZipZap receipt has been sent to my email, then I email BitInstant right away. Usually they send it out within a minute or two after paying MoneyGram, so if you don&#039;t see any inbound BTC coming on Blockchain, go ahead and contact BitInstant. Copy and paste the ZipZap receipt for faster processing when you send out the email requesting your BTC.<br /><br />BitInstant has great support, they always come through, that&#039;s why you shouldn&#039;t hesitate with these guys. They don&#039;t ask much of your info; like you, they care about BTC, not money laundering. For the fastest support, just call them. I&#039;ve only had to call once because I was being impatient, but they handled the transaction quickly and were helpful over the phone.<br /><br />They&#039;re good peeps.

They&#039;ll have you sorted in less than five mins.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>already got the coins like i just said.. what i am stating is that i was complicating on getting a new coin method because there has not only been me waiting but others also. why dont you go and read the form and then come back and have this convo with me.. at least other Sr. form members did that and where more helpful than you..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok this is something i wanted to put because i have seen alot of people that have had this problem and none have posted the end result.this is mine.<br /><br /><br />YEA!!!! thanks you BITINSTNT..&nbsp; ok after a day and a half of stress i finally recieved my BTC..&nbsp; &nbsp;In the defense of BITINSTNT they did send me my coins so all you guys that are read<br />this i hope it will iliminate some of your fears. After sending my coins through zip zap i did not receive my btc for a day and a half. After going to the support site&nbsp; i sent a few messages and finally today they where pushed through.<br />It was a bad experience with a positive outcome..will i use them again.I think because of the ease of use and the fact that they finally sent them..I will give them another try.I have to as i live out in the boonies.<br />I do wish they had someone to speak to though. They do have a number but it is just a recording telling you to go to the support site..supposedly they have a live chat but i didnt get that far.I have had many trans. with them and never had a problem i hope i never have another one. <br />ps i would love to hear what happened to some of the guys that said they waited for 8 day or more.&nbsp; what was the end result i think it is important ..I think if you could make a thread where we can all post our experience it would be&nbsp; great..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Damn bro, put your weapon down. I&#039;m not trying to be aggressive with you. You&#039;re right, I forgot that you mentioned you already got the btc. The advice still applies for the future tho, if you don&#039;t get your BTC sent out within a few minutes after paying, just send them an email or call them. You&#039;ll have your btc soon enough.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had to wait more than an hour or two for BitInstant to manually send the btc if the order didn&#039;t process as fast as it should.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
