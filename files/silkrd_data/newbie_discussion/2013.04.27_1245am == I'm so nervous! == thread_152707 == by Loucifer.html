				Okay guys so I made my first Silk Road purchases and foolishly I couldn&#039;t control my self. First one was an oz of weed, then a half oz, then 2 grams of BHO. Problem is all packages are from California. Will this raise suspicion? Am I fucked? I don&#039;t know what to do! Please give advice!

				don&#039;t worry. so many people send mail from California ll the time. what you bought is to small for them to launch an investigation. even if the sops find it and they want to pursue you they will come to your house. don&#039;t say a word. you don&#039;t even have to answer the door. if they have a warrant which they wont they will let themselves in. just deny any knowledge of&nbsp; a package rember someone could have mistakenly sent i to you or use your address with out your knowledge. if you dont have drugs in your possession they really cant do anything. just don&#039;t sign for any packages if you so worried. take a break and find another address. its always best to use another name and address then your own. take your time here. the benefits of the road is for the long run. not jsut for one or 2 oz but dont worry they cant do shit and worst case scenario you will get probation cause its all personal use. but that&#039;s worst case. youll be fine. the vendors that are good conceal you product very well so hopefully u did research and picked the right one. every time u get that itch to make a purchase wait 3 days and study the vendor. don&#039;t impulse buy drugs online. that&#039;s a no no. in a week or so youll be hitting ur bong filled with the dankest&nbsp; thinking how paranoid you were. let it go. your a fucking cool motherfucker and no one can tell u shit.<br /><br />p.s. if you get a letter type shipment write RETURN TO SENDER in RED magic marker and leave by your door for a few days just incase so if they come in you may not be liable for whats inside

				CALM DOWN!!!&nbsp; that is first...i was nervous once tooo,&nbsp; but you need to understand that the people who deliver your package, is a mailman... not the FBI!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;they deliver millions of packages a day.... and if you did choose a legit vendor, then the stealth should be enough to get it there for sure.... no worries my friend, it will come.

				Probably a little late now, but if you&#039;re nervous, maybe start by ordering some prescription medication so you can test the waters.&nbsp; They&#039;re technically illegal, but you won&#039;t be facing hard time for 20 Xanax in the mail. Then you can get comfortable with the whole process.

You use the persons name that normally receives mail there. if you have friends that&nbsp; have their own address send it too only if they are cool with it. your address is one of the most important aspects of the process. don&#039;t use a fake name. but ask around to your cool friends about the mail they get. Do they on a consistent basis more than 3 months get someone else s mail&nbsp; that use to live there regularly check what type of mail look for bank statements and bills.T His is a sign that they have not yet change adress. down side they can forward the address but it takes 2 weeks decide to forward his mail to his new address just by chance while it in transit. but it is common that happens. If possible try not to let the postman see u. in small towns they know everybody&#039;s business. and never lrt the post guy know what u l like.<br /><br /><br />also JOR (JESUSOFRAVE)&nbsp; link http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f311c62590<br />good&nbsp; luck

				They are good at packaging that stuff. As long as you didn&#039;t order from some schmuck cops won&#039;t be able to find it. Shoulda gave away the bongs and drugs so once your stuff comes you could get something back.
