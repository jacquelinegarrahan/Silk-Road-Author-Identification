				I thought there was a &#039;SR Vendor&#039; status on the forums? Meaning you could post in any board category even if your post count is at 1. Might be wrong, try to contact one of the moderators like Scout, or one of the administrators.

				Yeah, this shit is getting on my nerves too. Your best bet for now would be contacting one of the moderators/administrators about that &#039;SR Vendor&#039; status. They should of informed everyone of this sudden change before even implementing it. Maybe they are still working on it, who knows. <br /><br />Getting really tired of spamming with useless posts though, I want to be part of the active community and contribute with logical posts, yet I am left here to spam like a 5-year old until I reach 50 posts.&nbsp; :-\

				It was implemented yesterday afternoon/evening, and so far has helped immensely with the bitcointalks/virwex scammers because we&#039;re usually able to catch it before they reach 50 posts (which means catching it before they&#039;re able to spam the entire forum).&nbsp;

				As a new vendor, I don&#039;t want or need access to the private vendor forums just yet (There should be access restrictions there) but maybe a &quot;New Vendor&quot; group that is allowed to post in &quot;product offers&quot;, &quot;product requests&quot;, and &quot;rumor mill&quot; is in order to allow new vendors the opportunity to advertise their services until they reach the 35 or 55 sales required for the vendor forum.
