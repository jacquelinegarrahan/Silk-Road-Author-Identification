				Once I was at a gas station and thought I saw a cop and just sprinted home, hearing voices telling me to stop till I got to my porch. Ended up flushing a g of the purest DMT I&#039;ve ever smoked because a cop came to my house about an hour later. Turns out he was just there to give my roommate court summons for a weed charge he&#039;d got like six months before.

				Damn, thats a FORTY FIVE minute survey, and I still feel like I didn&#039;t convey how truly terrifying my first (and only shroom trip) was. I thought only doing 3G&#039;s would barely cause visuals, didn&#039;t know my dealer had some of the most potent stuff ever. Ended up spending hours floating through purgatory looking back on how my life was before I had died. Not only that, but I found out in that purgatory that life was apparently meaningless, and everything on Earth was just there as puppetry for my entertainment. I balled my eyes out, and the most intense feeling of misery ever engulfed me. <br /><br />It was weird totally losing my shit like that. I&#039;d tried LSD (2 strong hits), 2-CI, Salvia, and I thought I was a master at keeping a good mindset. Needless to say, I&#039;ll be staying away from shrooms for a while. But I have to redeem my conscience eventually, I&#039;ll try them again someday.

				well i did have an eye opening experience once. it was a bad trip afterwards but one hell of a good time while i was tripping. off of the slightest amount too, i had a casing that only produced two shrooms and then a couple aborts. then nothing else at all. i was curious as everything was healthy so after they had dried i gave them a shot one night.<br /><br />was around a gram dry... i believe slightly less but i can&#039;t remember 100%. the trip went normal and i remember thinking how crazy it was i was getting such intense effects off of what little i ate. the strain was thai lipa yai (which i know, a cube is a cube) to which i had ate many many of before. anyways around the 4 hour mark or so i&#039;d say is when things went crazy. i completely lost it while just laying in my bed i began becoming one with the bed. soon followed by complete loss of myself and being shot into space. i said to myself, &quot;oh, so THIS is what they mean by trip, I&#039;m actually taking a trip somewhere this time&quot;. it was nuts... i remember just bits and pieces of it. but upon waking up naked with all posters ripped off of my walls, electrical sockets to lamps and shit chewed up, broken glass all over my floor and piss by my window which was left open. glad i didn&#039;t hut myself honestly because i was gone. i remember thinking i had passed on during the trip but i was fine with that. i finally understood everything... all just made sense. <br /><br />craziest time of my life. i&#039;ve never tripped that hard since and i&#039;ve tried before but quite sure how the fuck it happened. especially off of such a small dose

				Closest to a bad trip that I have had lasted about 30-45 minutes. I was sitting in my chair leaning my head up against my hand. My arm was taking up maybe 10% of my field of vision on the far left side and after a while i began to perceive my arm as an evil being that was in the room. So for at least half an hour I&#039;m just sitting there, battling the evil spirits in my room until I realized it was just my arm and I changed positions in the room and everything felt to have instantly brightened up and I was on my way to yet another positive tip on mushrooms!

				Hybris of trying drugs, especially in younger ages, I have experienced is one of the main factors that can ruin a trip. It ruins the trip by changing the mindset, when someone who is not ready for a psychedelic, knows little about its effects and uses, you will know that this person&#039;s trip will differ from a person who knows his shit. The only difference between these people is that one guy keeps his mental state positive and the other one is still learning the basics so you can imagine his state of mind...<br /><br />To answer your question: No, I have not had a bad trip on shrooms (not done it many times). I do not believe there is a greater chance to have a bad trip on shrooms than other stronger psychedelics. To me it felt like it is much easier to have a bad trip on acid. Many people have had useful things come out of their bad trips more so than the good trips. Erowid is your friend :)<br /><br /><br />Entity

				Myfirst bad trip was in LSA seeds. I would say it was worse than Muchrooms regarding the bodyload and the nasty mindfuck I got. It was many years ago and at that time I was about 15. I&#039;m sure I would have handled it different now, but at that time I didn&#039;t know what &quot;loss of ego&quot; really ment.<br />However, that horror story turned my life around. At first I got very paranoid, scared to get a panic attack again until I developed somekind of agoraphobia. <br /><br />However, my intrest for psychedelics grew way larger, cause after all I could see their potential even though I wasn&#039;t ready to handle them. Still today I hassitate to touch them. Ever heard the story that you should jump up on the horse after falling off to not get a phobia of horses? well, I&#039;m a little bit in that situation. While I was at worst I promised myself over and over to never touch a tryptamine again. And that promise alone can easy set a bad mindset and create a bad setting.. So next time when I&#039;m ready, perhaps when I reach my 40&#039;s. I will go for the Phenetylamines instead. I.e. Mescaline. Not that I believe it&#039;s easier to control, it&#039;s just all about my mind.<br />I have found many other ways to expand my mind though, and prepare myself for the day I will need to meet my daemons,&nbsp; cause I can&#039;t live a whole life scared of something that has the potential to cure the only unreasonable fear I got in life. <br />But as for RC&#039;s, I will stay far away. 4-aco-Det was the only one I ever tried in the psychedelic world (and some Mephedrones and similar, but that doesn&#039;t count..)
