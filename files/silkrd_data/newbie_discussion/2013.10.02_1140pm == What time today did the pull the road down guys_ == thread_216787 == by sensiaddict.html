				i&#039;m pretty sure it was still on at around 12 midday GMT. to be honest this all seems pretty fast to me, i was on the site earlier, around midday, it was still up and running. within a few hours i was reading that the site had been seized, poor dpr had been collared and that he had been charged already. wtf man? how quick did they charge him?<br /><br />its pretty obvious that the feds left the site up and running for longer when they could have shut it down. possibly even weeks or months. which just shows what two faced lying motherfuckers they are. their prohibition laws are supposedly there in the first place to keep the public safe from the harmful effects of recreational drugs. by leaving the site up and running when they could have taken it down means they have left the public exposed to these so called dangerous drugs and the harm that they do to people. i wonder how many people overdosed or caught HIV or hep C while they were leaving the site operational, just so they could get their arrest. i hope the lives of those people were worth it so that some dirty pig fed could get a promotion. fucking low down, self-contradicting cunts the lot of them. go stick your tongues back up the politicians assholes you slimy turncoat cunts.<br /><br />ironically shutting down the silk road is now going to expose thousands of drug users to way more harm from buying their drugs of the streets now. way to go to protect the public from the harmful effects of drugs you dirty lying cunts. everyone knows that the laws aren&#039;t really there to protect anyone from the harmful effects. those so called elite, the fat rich greedy pigs at the top, are the dealers at the top of the chain, the ones making the real big money from drugs. they want them to stay illegal to protect their cash cow. they don&#039;t give two shits for public safety. and the feds are just their lackies.

				The war on drugs is a never ending war, you know why, bcuz the people who are claiming to be against the illegal drug trade are the same ones accepting the drug money under the table, and it&#039;s good for the economy, so it can&#039;t be all bad now can it? This is bullshit.
