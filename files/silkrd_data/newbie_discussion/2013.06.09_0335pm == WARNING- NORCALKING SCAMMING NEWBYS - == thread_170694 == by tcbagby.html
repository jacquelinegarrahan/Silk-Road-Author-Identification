				Kettle, meet pot.<br />FFS, YOU are the NEWBIE here, with only 5 posts, lol.<br />Do you make it a habit spouting off nonsense everywhere you go? There is a SPECIFIC process to follow when encountering trouble on the SR, you are NOT following it. <br />Do yourself a huge favor and read the fucking FAQ before your account gets banned. Creating multiple posts badmouthing a certain vendor is NOT the way to go about things.<br /><br />Something is not right with this post.

				Here is the rest of the story.<br /><br />tcbagby placed an order with us on Fri May 31 after we finished processing orders for the day.&nbsp; We usually send orders out on Saturdays as well, but for only the 3rd time in the last year, we took Sat off.<br /><br />Monday morning while we were still processing orders we received a message from tcbagby&#039;s SR account stating;<br /><br />tcbagby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hety bro please DO NOT SEND the order I placed with you to the address I sent. I will give you a new address to send it to in 2-3 days. Please tell me if you have already sent it to the address I gave you.<br />This is the order: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/632f6aa6a5<br />Sorry for the hassle bro, I fucked up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />So we replied back that he caught us just in time we would wait.&nbsp; We put it on our &quot;pending&quot; shelf &amp; forgot about it. <br /><br />Wed the 5th we receive a pm from the forums from him but written as if he thought he was contacting SR Customer Service!<br /><br /><br />I sent an order to them on Friday, May 31st and paid for priority shipping.&nbsp; I expected the order to go out that day, or at least by 11 am the next day as they advertise.&nbsp; That was six days ago.&nbsp; when I checked the status of my order it says &quot;processing.&quot;&nbsp; I think the only thing that is being &quot;processed&quot; is my bitcoin I sent them.&nbsp; I have tried several times to get in touch with them, and no answer.&nbsp; Also, I can&#039;t log on to silkroad now my original name and password info, and have to open a new account with a new name and password to gain access.&nbsp; This is fast looking like a scam to me. <br /><br />Before I go postal and start spreading the word on the internet about them AND silkroad I thought I would&nbsp; try this.&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND MY ORDER OR REFUND MY BITCOIN <br /><br /><br />We responded back to him after looking in the log book which showed that order was processed on Mon, (not recognizing his username) (we get between orders &amp; messages 300 - 400 usernames per week, so can&#039;t remember everything)&nbsp; so we let him know that his order didn&#039;t go out until Mon, so hold onto his pants!<br /><br />Then he pm&#039;s us again on the forum;<br /><br /><br />All you had to do was respond to my emails.&nbsp; To charge what you do for priority shipping, then wait until Monday to ship my order without notifying me is poor customer follow-up.&nbsp; You could have sent it first class for a hell of a lot less. <br /><br />But I am glad you did ship my stuff and no hard feelings.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good I will order on a regular basis from you.&nbsp; Understand this is my first time doing this and ripoffs do occur. <br /><br /><br /><br />To which we responded that we have not yet received any communication this week from him, maybe he sent it to our backup Tormail email address which had been down, &amp; that&#039;s where he had sent it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Send my order or refund my money.&nbsp; This is my second email to you. I<br />placed the order last Friday and paid you for priority shipping.<br />This is feeling like a scam and if it is you won&#039;t get away with it. I<br />will make sure everyone on the internet hears about you.&nbsp; If its not a<br />scam you really need to beef up your customer service.<br /><br /><br />So we decided to cancel his order &amp; let him figure out that he was the one who screwed everything up later.<br /><br />Then later Wed afternoon, we looked at the pending order on the shelf &amp; realized it was his order that had been asked for us to hold until he got us a new address.&nbsp; <br /><br />We tried to let him know that it might not be coming now that we realized the rest of the story &amp; we had been holding it waiting for a new address.&nbsp; He responded with a few more unkind messages &amp; told us to send it with tracking or he would send a message to every SR member that we were scammers.<br /><br />This was his last pm to us from the forum;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;tcbagby<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Newbie<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Posts: 8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Karma: +0/-2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [thank] [discourage]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View Profile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Email<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal Message (Offline)<br /><br />Scumbags<br />« Sent to: NorCalKing on: June 09, 2013, 07:32 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br /><br />Check your messages on tormail.org for an update,&nbsp; I added three new forums regarding your shitty service, check them out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll add a few more this evening.<br /><br />Send my order USPS first class, with a tracking number.&nbsp; &nbsp;Until you do I will continue spreading the word about your scam service on the SR Forum. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We finally think we know how it got him all confused . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;He is a n00b &amp; an old Viet Nam vet that may be missing or is on other medication which would clear up some of the reasons he doesn&#039;t get what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; <br /><br />We believe he registered and got the order in, but then forgot the url, &amp; when he searched to find SR again he ended up on a phishing link which there are still 1 or 2.&nbsp; Since he couldn&#039;t get in he couldn&#039;t message us &amp; eventually pmed us on the forums.&nbsp; Meanwhile whoever phished him logged in to his account &amp; saw the fresh order, messaged us to hold off until we were sent a new address.&nbsp; His messages have not been read since Mon morning when we responded back to him &amp; we sent a couple others . . . none have been read.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don&#039;t think he even knows what being fished is all about &amp; may have forgotten how he got on to SR to begin with.<br /><br />So he hasn&#039;t been on his account to see that there is no order, &amp; his coin would be back in his account which he adamantly deny&#039;s getting his money back.<br /><br />We sent him another message to log back into his account &amp; then he could read the message that was sent to us from his account on Mon asking us to hold the order, &amp; then see that there is no longer an order &amp; he has his bitcoin in his account, but we&#039;re not holding our breath, he believes we were trying to screw him, so he&#039;s out to get us come hell or high water!<br /><br />So since he intends to spread his &quot;cheer&quot; around the forum &amp; not listen to reason, we thought we would give people the WHOLE story.<br /><br /><br />NCK<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ll break it down for everyone.&nbsp; tcbagby placed an order with NorCalKing and sent his address and everything was fine.&nbsp; He then goes to a phishing site the next day.&nbsp; The phisher logs into tcbagby&#039;s account and tells NCK that he sent the wrong address and not to send the order.&nbsp; tcbagby logs onto the forum a few days later and starts bitching at NCK.&nbsp; Long story short, NCK cancelled the order and the bitcoins went back to tcbagby&#039;s account which was phished.<br /><br />tcbagby is just ignorant.<br /><br />You can see where he had his account phished in the post below.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168284.msg1199110#msg1199110">Quote from: tcbagby on June 04, 2013, 05:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have trouble logging onto Silk Road.&nbsp; The site posts that it&#039;s down for maintenance.&nbsp; BUT when I log in a new name and password no problems.&nbsp; What&#039;s up with this?&nbsp; To make things more complicated, I placed an order with norcalking for some weed and it hasn&#039;t arrived.&nbsp; The order page says it&#039;s being processed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I being scammed?&nbsp; tcbagby<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
