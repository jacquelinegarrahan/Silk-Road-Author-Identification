				I read from the vendors feedback, that he has written addresses by hand, now I got letter from post office and I have to get it and sign for it. Could it be because the name was written wrong? Or LE has the package? I live in EU btw. It&#039;s first time ordering from him so I don&#039;t know how good his stealth is and he is quite a new vendor, but he has score of 100 with about 50 transactions. <br />I will not get the package, but the big question for me is, can I still use this name and address? I don&#039;t really have another option. I&#039;m thinking about asking the vendor to reship the package.&nbsp; What to you guys think?

				What was wrong, the last name ? or the whole name.<br />I usually, change my last name to one of my middle names which isn&#039;t registered to my house. so if anyone ever asks, il just say it&#039;s my middle name. or if the police come down, il just say i don&#039;t know who that is.<br /><br />And it&#039;s&nbsp; always been fine for me, never had any troubles. so it should be safe, but i&#039;m not sure if its different for different countries.

				He wrote 1 letter wrong on last name, I don&#039;t think this name even exist. <br />I guess I have to add this wasn&#039;t my real name, I used previous tenants name, never had a problem before, have gotten about 10 packages like this before. Maybe I should use another previous tenants name when reshipping or this can add more suspicion if the package was really caught?

				Clean your house of narcotics or anything incriminating and get computer/laptop/Usb&#039;s out along with it, go pick up your package and if anything happens deny that it was yours and get a lawyer. if all goes well and your drugs come through okay i say you could use it again<br /><br />You know how to spell your last name correctly and if it&#039;s wrong on the package you could pass it off as someone sending you drugs, someone who hates you, ex girlfriend etc. . Aslong as it wasn&#039;t a massive order i presume and you have no more coming what could they get you for they don&#039;t have sufficient evidence.<br /><br />But don&#039;t take my word for it&nbsp;

				I sign nothing if I don&#039;t know what I ordered, and in case of SR I never know who sent me this package! ...<br /><br /><br />you didn&#039;t know about shipment with sign request? what vendor say on his profile page? only few have sign shipment, and for large request, for what I know.<br />

				@acid<br />I can&#039;t pick up anything, I didn&#039;t use my real name.<br /><br />@Tor<br />No info on vendors profile and nothing about signature in the comments, I have read them all.<br /><br />Actually I have another package coming in, I guess this will show if I can use this address again or not. All are small amounts btw. I&#039;m off to clean the house now.

				Depends on what country, for example in sweden it is not allowed for the customs to let a parcel go threw then take you when you go to the post office. so if it got threw the border it should not be a problem. the Question is if the open the package when you dont come and get it after a while and se what it is and contact the police. BUT as you said it is not ordered in your name so you can easily deny that it is you.
