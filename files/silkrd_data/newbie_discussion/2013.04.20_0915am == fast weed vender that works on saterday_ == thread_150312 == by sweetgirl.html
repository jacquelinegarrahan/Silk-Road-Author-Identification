				You would have to pay some pretty premium prices to get that next day air shipment, plus the vendor must be located in your country as well. i know of some people, and if the price is right, i may be able to get you your stuff. But I don&#039;t want to ask you publicly where you&#039;re located, nor do I know what quality you want? exotics or greens?
