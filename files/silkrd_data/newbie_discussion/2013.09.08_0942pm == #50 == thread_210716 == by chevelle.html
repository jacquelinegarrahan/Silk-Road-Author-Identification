				I&#039;d like to thank all the people that made this possible....well I guess that&#039;s just me me. Whatever.<br /><br />Seriously though...here&#039;s a shout out to SOME of the proper vendors here that keep me coming back...<br /><br /><br />Nawlins...communication isn&#039;t always as fast as I would like, but more than makes up for it with fast processing and shipping. Of course the quality of product is always up SR standards. Read: AAA+<br /><br /><br />J1m1th1ng...I honestly can&#039;t say enough about this guy.&nbsp; He&#039;s like Nawlins with communication. Seriously... he should be considered the standard SRvendors.<br /><br />JescoWhite...his product might not be for everybody but as far as new vendors go...he makes every effort to be a proffesional vendor. Just because of this he gets props.<br /><br /><br />Now let me tell you about a shit vendor....<br /><br />MIMM...or Marijuanaismymuse.....worst experience ever.&nbsp; Left him an honest review of his services and got threatened with my address and other BS. Unacceptable.&nbsp; I seriously won&#039;t do business with another Canadian vendor because of this guy. Almost enough to make me quit SR.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m leaving some vendors out(oh yeah..props to. theDopeSpot, for quality product and the fastest delivery ever. Still not sure how it came that fast) but there aremany of you. Just want to say thx for making SR such an awesome experience. I look forward to dealing with you guys for many years to come.<br /><br /><br />Note: For anyone paying attention.&nbsp; No fireworks...not even one balloon.
