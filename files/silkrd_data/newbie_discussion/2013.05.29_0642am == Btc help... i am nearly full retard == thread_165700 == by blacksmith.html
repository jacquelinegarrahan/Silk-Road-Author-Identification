				ahh, I see. you need to find where that bitcoin address is located, and usually there should be some sort of password to withdraw the coins to any other address of your choosing. I know this may not help alot but I tried my best, as I usually just purchase my bitcoins anonymously on SilkRoad. Good Luck! I would ask the company you recieved your coins from whats up.

				To find the address you need to send them to click &quot;account&quot; on SR and you will find a long string of about 30 characters. It will usually take about 1-2 hours for them to get to your account because SR tumbles (what you call washing) them for you so you don&#039;t need to do that.

				If you are going to purchase your coins outside of SR. I&#039;d use localbitcoins.com. They have a wallet for you when you set up an account. You tumbl your coins if you wish before bringing them in to SR. I know JumboMonkeyBiscuit will tumbl them for you and deposit them into your SR user name. I used them for the first time the other day. Super fast coins and easy to deal with. I highly recommend them for bitcoins. <br />

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
