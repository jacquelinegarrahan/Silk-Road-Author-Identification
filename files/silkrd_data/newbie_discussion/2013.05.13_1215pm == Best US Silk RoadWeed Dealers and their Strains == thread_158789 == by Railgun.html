				BlueSkiesRedEyes had some Blue dream that was absolutely amazing, true top shelf quality, should be back up when his crop is done.<br /><br />Angel Eyes is currently king (queen?) IMO. She&#039;s currently pretty much sold out of the 4 month and 2 month cured Grape Bogglegum (of which I have sampled both and been blown away by the quality), but all her other strains look like top quality bud from every review I have read about them. I think they are a collective of medical growers. <br /><br />Looks like she just ran out of the ChemDawg x G13<br /><br />She also has a couple of other strains that I have not tried:<br /><br />Kali Mist<br /><br />Rock Candy<br /><br />The Big Lebowski<br /><br />I am seriously looking forward to the next strains that this grower comes up with. <br /><br />Review Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131843.0

				I have used a few vendors, and I can offer what I know based on those transactions.&nbsp; As far as price and quality, MotherOf2 was selling cherry pie that blew my mind.&nbsp; It was perfect looking, tasting, and beat the hell out of most anything else I&#039;ve ever tried... though I will say I prefer other strains during the day.&nbsp; I have also worked with Caliconnect for Purple Trainwreck, which was lower in price but not as tasty.&nbsp; It did look and smell great though, and I would never say I felt ripped off by any means.&nbsp; Trader Joe&#039;s also had God&#039;s Gift, which totally lived up to its name.&nbsp; Of these 3 vendors, I would work with all 3 again.&nbsp; I will also update you on PureOganx when the time comes.<br /><br />For those vendors I do not trust, I will say 420Connections.&nbsp; I ordered from them and received a bunch of crap.&nbsp; I had already finalized, so I was stuck with garbage.&nbsp; After confronting the vendor, he/she said they would offer a discount on the next order.&nbsp; How in the hell am I supposed to know if the next order will be any better?&nbsp; I&#039;m not throwing my money away... Trust is earned, not given.&nbsp; It just seems like this vendor is much more interested in volume and money than he is in working with his customers.
