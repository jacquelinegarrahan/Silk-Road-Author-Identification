				I don&#039;t think it would hurt to sticky a thread that spells out (US) shipping methods for us newbs! A search for &#039;shipping&#039; comes up with an awful lot to sift through, so could some please explain each method to me? I gather that First Class seems to be discouraged, why is that? Also which method(s) can you track? I also read that tracking isn&#039;t the best idea for stealthiness, but when you&#039;re living somewhere where you really need to get to it before someone else does it might be necessary.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming Express of course would be the quickest? From what I read/hear the slower the safer. I will probably go with Priority, but I would just like to clarify exactly what it is? I&#039;m assuming small orders usually will just be small envelopes in the mail like any old letter/small package?<br /><br />**edit** By the way I just noticed the entire topic on Shipping. My apologies there, however I still think it doesn&#039;t hurt to keep a thread open specifically for newbies to be able to post in and ask questions.

				First Class is the safest and slowest.&nbsp; It requires a warrant to open without your permission.&nbsp; Vendors do not like to use First Class because there are so many scamming buyers and First Class does not come with tracking.<br /><br />Priority CAN have tracking.&nbsp; It does not require a warrant to open without your permission.<br /><br />Express comes with tracking.&nbsp; It does not require a warrant to open without your permission.<br /><br />Media Mail is regularly opened and checked to make sure that it first the requirements and should never be used.

				I know 100% for a fact USPS can open first class mail with no warrant.&nbsp; They have 2-3 oopholes that allow them to get to the contents with no warrant that apply to the vast majority of packages.&nbsp; If you have a package and the circumstances don&#039;t create a situation where one of these loopholes can be used, they can chemically burn the outer packaging off, thus opening it.<br /><br />The one loophole I remember had to do with holes in packaging.&nbsp; They can&#039;t open a package.&nbsp; But they can make the hole bigger.&nbsp; Some other weird law has to do with the time of day but /what they can do to access a first class but i dont recall the details.<br /><br /><br />Obviously this will only happen if you raise suspision, but the same goes with any shipment&nbsp; So i guess the real trick is to never give someone a reason to search your package, not use the packaging you think they cant search.

				Thanks for the responses to this, and for not totally giving me shit for not just looking at the Shipping topic. One of those times when I really should have looked first, thanks. :D<br /><br />Also can someone clarify the deal with tracking packages? I&#039;ve heard different things here. From what I gather, it&#039;s best not to track in Tor because it will flag you, right? So I guess if you have to track something, do it from a public connection? I plan to not track anything anyway, I&#039;m just curious.<br /><br />Also that is a little scary about the laws at the USPS. However the shipments I&#039;ll be getting are so tiny I doubt I have anything to worry about. Probably the worst they would do is throw it away or something.

				It is best not to track a package at all.&nbsp; If you must track a package then use public wifi or a VPN.

				no matter which way, you shouldn&#039;t have to sign, nor should you open the package right away. I always write rts and set it by the door...........you didn&#039;t order and you can&#039;t control what the pigs sent you to set you up.
