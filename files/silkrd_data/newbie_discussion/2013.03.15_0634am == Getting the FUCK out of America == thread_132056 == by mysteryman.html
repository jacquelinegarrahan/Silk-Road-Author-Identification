				US seems to be the best place to be for SR. Seems like we get the most domestic shippers which means less interference and the fastest delivery times.<br /><br />The government is obviously corrupt as fuck but I happen to like the founding father&#039;s ideas and diverse cultures you find here. The government does not represent what the US is all about. OP you sound like a teenager.You should focus on the positives of living here.

				America is turning into a corporate police state where everything you do and say is recorded. There is little leniency if you are poor, and wage slavery is a very real issue. You fucks don&#039;t realize that the system is designed to take your freedom away as soon as you are born/immigrate here. Sure this states are a lot better than say, Libya, but that isn&#039;t say much. <br /><br />Fuck it pisses me off that people don&#039;t realize how shit the states are when they have never experienced a better way. <br /><br />Imma go fuck Bjork now.

				Fuck Obama. If he was ever caught during his college days of smoking he would never be president now.<br /><br />But he&#039;s still closed more medical MJ vendors than the bush administration did.<br /><br />Drones are obviously in violation of the constitution but the government doesn&#039;t care. Democrats seem less crazy on the surface than Republicans but they are all in the pockets of the corporations in the end. US has some major problems I won&#039;t deny that but I&#039;ve slowly realized that doesn&#039;t make me want to leave. Every country has their own problems they are trying to deal with.<br /><br />On the real though I dont know anything about government process and im mad drunk and trying to get my post count up, so if anyone would like to the enlighten me please go ahead! lol<br />

				It doesn&#039;t matter whether or not you can smoke marijuana or not in your state. By the way, the feds are targeting growers and businesses in states where pot has been legalized. <br /><br />Please look at the larger picture of the USA&#039;s state of affairs.

				We are the proles. <br /><br />Read 1984 to get an idea of why it doesn&#039;t matter that we out number them. The masses don&#039;t care, they don&#039;t understand, or they don&#039;t trust what anyone has to say. Brainwashing has shifted our priorities, conditioned public consciousness, and created this fucked up social discourse of how civic liberties aren&#039;t needed in this post 9/11 world since big brother knows best.<br /><br />You can educate, but it only goes so far for so long until even the people you turn become jaded.

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there was an intergalactic battle for resources between alien nations right now...<br /><br />Also the corporate dick munchers and politicians may be winning now, but their time will come (whether they expire from age or lose everything they have) cause time will go on and new changes will happen! Sure the media and our culture has slowly deteriorated people&#039;s capacity to think past the comforts of materialism and false livelihood but there are also many that are aware of America&#039;s slow fall from the world stage and core values. One of these days, hopefully, I believe that American&#039;s will realize their true core values and what the American dream is really built on: hard work, dedication, and freedom of thought.<br /><br />If not, then it&#039;s just going to make life harder for Americans. I wouldn&#039;t blame anyone for leaving because there are now many places with better opportunities, but who doesn&#039;t love a great comeback?
