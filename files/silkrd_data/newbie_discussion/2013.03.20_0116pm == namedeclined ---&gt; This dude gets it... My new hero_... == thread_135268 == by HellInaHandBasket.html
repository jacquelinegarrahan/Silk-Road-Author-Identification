				From the vendors page;<br /><br />+++&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;****<br /><br /><br />☞2013-03-14☜<br />+I am very thankful to have made it this far on Silk Road. Therefore I have recently donated portions of my profits to a children&#039;s hospital and to a charity to benefit military veterans. (to stay anonymous and not have donations tracked I won&#039;t say exactly which military charity or hospital)<br />+I now offer forged Canadian auto insurance cards for State Farm and Allstate.<br /><br /><br />+++&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;****<br /><br />taken at face value too but I have had this conversation with many many people over the years... If the dealers and crime gangs gave some (not all not even a large percent but some..) of their stock piled cash (think Coke dealers with houses filled from roof to floor with cash money in Mexico or Crack dealer/king in NY with a comparable , and equaly obscene amount of cash stored away and in such volume the ability to actually move and spend it becomes an enterprise all of its own) to charity and the comunity for Schools and these sorts of things the public perception would be changed in a heartbeat to almost the polar opposite of what it is today...<br /><br />The Italian Mafia got this and used it become as institutionalized , wanted and even needed as say the local member of parliament or the mayor and so on... Its as old a Sherwood Forrest but its funny how much more you like and listen to the people who pay for the soup kitchens that feeds the homeless or paid for the park play gear that your kids love to play on. the ones opening their wallets and hearts to try and see some change.. its also hard to keep the image of selfish and criminal characters when you show you have cares and concerns that are common in a community...<br /><br />namedeclined ....&nbsp; You sir are ahead of your time and a prince amongst men IMO. if only 5 bucks, 50 or 5000+ donated doesn&#039;t matter.. not relevant and not the message to be taken away by the people who read this.... you are showing the way, a better way too than self interest only, to a better future for all.<br /><br />Much love and respect to you. may the day shine a special warmth on you for many days to come cause you have made someone half a world away feel like there really is a chance of that better future for him and the family he loves so much....<br /><br />To the vendors and buyer that steal by scamming or selective scamming.... you have just been shown for the degenerate, short sighted and selfish cunts you really are by this simple act of sublim compassion and selflessness... This dude takes the world he sees and tries to make change where he can and you take the world you see and use it to justify your pathetic, selfish and abhorrent acts...<br /><br />Peace..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As a vendor I do my best to help socially how I can, I haven&#039;t been here long but I have my own way of paying society back.<br /><br />Selling through SR allows me to offer RSO cancer treatments at discounted price to patients who need it.<br /><br />A treatment requires 60g of concentrate which is A LOT but by being able to sell it at a fair price it allows me to offer it to patients at a discounted rate making it much more affordable.<br /><br />I can&#039;t think of too many cancer treatments that have a 70% cure rate at a cost of around £1200.<br /><br />This is something I can only do IRL because I really need to be able to consult with people going through it but it helps me sleep better at night.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Reminds me of how the Yakuza helps out when earthquakes and tsunamis hit Japan.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: wikipedia</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, the Yakuza sent hundreds of trucks filled with &quot;food, water, blankets, and sanitary accessories&quot; to aid the people in the affected areas of the natural disaster. CNNMéxico said that although the Yakuza operates through extortion and other violent methods, they are also &quot;[moved] swiftly and quietly to provide aid to those most in need.&quot; Such actions by the Yakuza are a result of their knowing of what it is like to &quot;fend for yourself,&quot; without any government aid or community support, because they are also considered &quot;outcast&quot; and &quot;dropouts from society.&quot; In addition, the Yakuza&#039;s code of honor (ninkyo) reportedly values justice and duty above anything else, and forbids allowing others to suffer; although this is at odds with their sexual trafficking.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Use of drugs have made me a lot less possessive, I find more pleasure in giving things away than using them myself :) I know some junkies however who would steal whenever given the chance. We need to be good people, not good citizens, right?

				Yeah man, pretty cool. Just think if drugs were legal and taxed. Think of how much honest money would go to places our democratically elected officials deem fit... it blows my mind. We could probably have the Rights dream of lower taxes and the Lefts dream of more services at the same time. Not to mention all the money we&#039;d save from the drug war and keeping convicted drug dealers and users locked in cages. And the reduction in violent crime. the list goes on.<br />

				If drugs were taxed and we ended the war on drugs, crime would also go down.

				I just completed an order with this vendor and besides how cool it is to see somebody giving back, I can tell you this vendor treats his account here like the business it is. Good communication and he really looked out for this customer. <br /><br />There are some good business men on the road. You just have to luck into them or do a lot of research to find them.
