				hi,<br />i have a little problem because i have a deal going on which went to the resolution center because the guy did a mistake and now send a reship like 2 days ago but the amount of extra days i put was not enough in the resolution center so we&#039;re running out of days... Now i tried to extend the due date for more days but it doesnt work... whats gonna happen in 2 days then? do i get an auto finalize or refund in my stats? Or will the silkroad staff simply extend the due date even more because i put it as a new resolution?

				When it is about to auto-finalize I would finalize.<br />You may have lost whatever, but you do want to take care of your stats properly.<br /><br />Also, when a reship happens I don&#039;t think you&#039;re entitled for a 2nd reship or a refund.

				i just dont trust this vendor... my shipment got lost domestic and i had 50 international shipments before and not a single one got lost but now he says that his domestic shipment got lost... its ridiculous... but if i finalize there&#039;s no way how i can get my money in case he doesnt ship and it was quite a big shipment.. but if i leave it in the resolution center i might get a refund from SR...<br />But i simply want to extend the due date even more... can anybody say who actually knows it for sure whats gonna happen

				I dunno man, but when there&#039;s 5 minutes left, just finalize.<br />By then the money is lost anyways if it doesn&#039;t show up.<br /><br />Do try to extend time, but I dunno if you can.<br />Just saying, auto-finalize is something very few has on their stats so it is something you might not want to consider letting happen, ever.<br /><br />I once finalized early because I left for work, it hadn&#039;t shown up by then. I shrugged it off and went to work, when I came back after a week it was in my postbox.<br /><br /><br />Hadn&#039;t I finalized my stats would be ruined. And poor mr. acid seller would have to wait a week for his well deserved money :(
