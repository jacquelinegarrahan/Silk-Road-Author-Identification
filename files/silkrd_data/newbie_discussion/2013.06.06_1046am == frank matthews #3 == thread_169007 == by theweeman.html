				dont know if anyone has tried frank matthews #3 heroin , but i ordered 3.5g from him on saturday , got it yesterday wednesday . <br />when i opened it i could tell straight away it was different heroin from what i had been getting from him over the last few months . <br />but he had not put on his page that it was a new batch ?<br />soon as i tried it i could smell that it was shit quality , to be honest it is no better than what i would get on the street but on the street it would be £100 not £230 .<br />i think it is not right that he is selling this stuff i buy from silk road , pay the extra take the chance it coming or getting stopped , because it is alot better quality and worth the money risk ect. so when i got that to say i was pissed off is an understatement . <br />i have sent frank matthews a message asking him what has happened and for a refund or better stuff , as i have been a good customer and have spent thousands with frank . but as of yet he has not got back to me , he has read the message , so ill give it a day or so .<br />just a warning to anyone that is going to buy his #3 , it is shit and not worth your money .

				Never tried his #3, but his #4 is excellent. It isnt cheap, but the quality is worth it. When I buy #3 though, I buy it in big quantities from c3amg. It&#039;s cheaper that way.

Ordered it, never arrived. But allthe times I bought his #3, it was same. not the best, but better than what you can get off SR. In my opinion, his #3 is the most stable product on SR. price/value is great as well, if you buy in a bulk
