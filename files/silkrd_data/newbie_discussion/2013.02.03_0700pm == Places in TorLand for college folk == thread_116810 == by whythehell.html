				Plagiarism is what&#039;s lame, in my opinion. Plus it&#039;s more fun to hack your brain with badass SR chems and do well by being crazy-smart and energized, no? Just a thought - no disrespect.

				There can not be a site that claims to offer papers that &quot;get past the lame ass plagiarism filters.&quot;<br /><br />When ONE person submits that paper it will then be in the database of the &quot;lame ass&nbsp; plagiarism filer.&quot;&nbsp; Best solution is just write it yourself. Take some drugs to help you focus if anything.

				No disrespect taken, but I&#039;m not looking to just copy an entire paper.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy enough to pull a random fact out of your ass and cite it as if it were taken from a book. But when you have 6 classes and you have to write 5+ page papers for each every week...it starts to get tedious, especially when your terrible teachers are forcing you to write papers that have no connection what so ever in the subject you are supposed to be learning about. <br /><br />I can easily write the papers myself but I would rather spend my time actually learning about the subject I am taking and not writing a paper that is just for numbers, when you have a full time job and life to take care of writing a paper on the reasons a dogs central nervous system is different from a humans&nbsp; just isn&#039;t as important as finishing your next chapter on the Mathematics of Blackhole mechanics. <br /><br />Sadly the school I am in is full of teachers that could give zero shits about their students and actually teaching them topics relevant to the course they thought they were taking.&nbsp; Give me a paper on astrophysics and I&#039;ll hack the shit out of my brain and write it myself properly, destroying your gradebook with my pure awesomeness. Conversely writing about dogs is not what I paid for and is a waste of energy...and Adderall <br /><br />I appreciate you guys suggesting to keep the integrity of college papers up but think about How much a person spends in tuition and having that that wasted on nonsense. <br />In that sense the plagiarism filter is lame, this paper will do me no good toward my degree,&nbsp; I already learned how to properly write a paper in Highschool, so it serves no purpose except to waste my time. <br /><br />**This post probably sounds aggressive, please don&#039;t take it that way. I&#039;m just speeded out and irritated by my lackluster learning experience&nbsp; and I&#039;m seriously writing a paper about a damn Dog in&nbsp; an astrophysics class**&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(
