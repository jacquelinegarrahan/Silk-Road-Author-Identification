				Hello my friends,<br /><br />a friend of mine runs a pharmacy and he has huge amounts of &quot;Oxycodone 60mg&quot;, &quot;Morphine&quot;, and also &quot;Fentanyl&quot;.<br />I am thinking about to setup an account on SR. But i am still not sure if this would be worth it. Because if i do it, i want to offer <br />the best prices. I think most Oxys and opiods are way to overpriced on SR.<br /><br />The only thing i have to say about the Oxys is that they are &quot;covered&quot; (for preventing misuse) means that you have to put a drop of water in your hand to remove the thin layer. its really easy and the loss is not more than maybe 1-2 mg. i snorted it and everthing is finde without any side effects. the pills are manufactured under high quality standards in germany. thats what i can gurantee. as well as the Morphone and the Fentanyl<br /><br />So my question:<br /><br />what is a good price for the opiod fans on SR?<br />That you would order the pills from me in future?<br /><br />I really must say my decision to open an account or not will be based on the replies i get&nbsp; on this post.<br />I am pretty new on SR. So any experienced user comments are welcome.<br /><br />

				If you think you can get away with it then GO FOR IT! Anything OXY related sells like crazy on SR. There&#039;s a lot of room for competitive prices. Since you have direct pharmacy access, your profit margin will be high, so you can offer insane prices and sell them out in hours. <br /><br />BTW if you don&#039;t already have a system for skimming the oxy&#039;s from the pharmacy, I&#039;d suggest storing the one&#039;s you&#039;re planning on taking for a little while. Then if you get audited or something else happens you&#039;ll still have the pills.
