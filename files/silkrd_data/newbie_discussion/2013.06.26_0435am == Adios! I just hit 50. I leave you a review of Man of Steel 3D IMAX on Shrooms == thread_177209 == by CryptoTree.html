				IT WAS AWESOME!<br /><br />Watching a 3D IMAX while tripping has been on my &quot;to-do&quot; list for awhile. Damn it was good. <br /><br />First of all, I liked the film a lot. Never been a fan of Superman, but they got it right this time. They make him very alien and otherwordly. They focus on his struggle being apart and alone from humanity which worked really well. <br /><br />Also I&#039;ll be honest, I had some trouble following the plot a little. But I knew well enough to just surf the ride and enjoy it as it came. It was less about specific plot points, and more about the general impression and experience. <br /><br />The flying scenes were really fun. I felt very open and wondrous, like being a little kid again. There was something noble and heroic in it, that I haven&#039;t felt since I watched Lord of the Rings when I was younger. I felt the call of Truth and Justice. Boom! Swoosh! Being a good guy was actually compelling. That&#039;s hard to do. Black is sexy man. Being the anti-hero is cool. Even if you&#039;re the &quot;good guy&quot; like Batman, you still get some wicked edge, some dangerous kung fu serrated metal gauntlets to fuck some hoods up. But Superman was just &quot;BOOM!&quot; and I really believed it, without an ounce of cynicism. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to watch it again when it comes out on DVD, sober, and see how my assessments lined up.&nbsp; I had a friend along and he enjoyed it too (he wasn&#039;t sober either). We then and went and hung out in a wild life park and goofed around. <br /><br />Man I wish this stuff was legal. Wouldn&#039;t it be rad to go to an IMAX and pick up your shrooms at the concession stand? Hmm, maybe not, then they&#039;d probably cost a lot more!

MPX is &quot;MultiPlex IMAX&quot;. It&#039;s basically a normal theater where the room has been jerry rigged to hold a screen in the IMAX ratio, but it&#039;s not actually much bigger than a normal screen.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a list of all True IMAX theatres. http://www.slashfilm.com/qa-imax-theatre-real-imax-liemax/<br /><br />One thing I want to try and do is watch a sad film on MDMA, and see how that effects me. It seems impossible to be sad on MDMA but I imagine it&#039;s possible. I imagine it will just deepen my empathy for the characters.
