				So I&#039;ve got 5 of these alprazolam blotter strips (100mg I believe) and I&#039;ve been experimenting with ROI...&nbsp; &nbsp;Typically with blotters is swim then around in my mouth / do them sublingually - but I&#039;m, not sure if alprazolam on blotter would work best just swallowed since is is not water soluable?&nbsp; &nbsp;Been trying both and they definitely both work... just can&#039;t tell if one hits faster, one lasts longer, etc... <br /><br />edit - alakazam alprazolam is the vendor and 100mg of xanax blotters was around $130... or so, I forgot, and can&#039;t look it up while the SR is under maintenance

				Friend of mine new to the Road keeps fluking excellent deals on weed (UK). <br /><br />Taking chances on new vendors with no feedback - it&#039;s a risk, but most of them will do good deals to build good feedback. Last 2 she bought have been 2g+ overweight on 5-7g purchases
