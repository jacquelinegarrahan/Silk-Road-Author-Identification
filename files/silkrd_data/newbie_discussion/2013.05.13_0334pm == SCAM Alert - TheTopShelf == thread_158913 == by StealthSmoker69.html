				Well i learned a valuable lesson today. NEVER FE for any product. I don&#039;t care who it is. If the vendor requires FE go somewhere else. I lost about 140USD so it wasn&#039;t as bad as some people but it burns me up. I should have known better. I&#039;m a veteran dealing with street dealers and this is not different than &quot;Fronting&quot; money IMHO. <br /><br />Just thought I would let off some steam. I have no more money and no weed :(<br /><br />Take Care Everyone

				He told me my gram was traced to my post office on Saturday and that it would be delivered on Monday. Well today is Monday and I got another of my packages from someone else (an OZ) but not my gram from him. So, he either lied through his fucking teeth or they seized the gram and sent my OZ which is unlikely as fuck. Why does he have no listings did they ban him? Whats going on?

				He just got me for $700 I&#039;m so angry/stressed/upset. I trust the decency of another human with all of my money. I even took a loan from my friend that I can&#039;t pay back yet now. I&#039;ve been using SR for a year with no problems then I get my money hung up for a month with wheels420 who went AWOL and leaves me to wait for resolve. Then I order from this asshole who just took my money and ran. I&#039;m a broke college student I can&#039;t afford any more weed now. NEVER FE IT&#039;S JUST A TOOL FOR SCAMMERS WITH NO RESPECT FOR GOOD BUSINESS OR MORALS.

				I orders a gram last tuesday. He asked for FE based on his feedback. I figured it&#039;s $20, so it shouldn&#039;t be a bit deal. Well, his seller profile is now gone. At least it was a small amount :/
