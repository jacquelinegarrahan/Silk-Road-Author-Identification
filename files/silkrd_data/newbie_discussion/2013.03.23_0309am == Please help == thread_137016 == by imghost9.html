				Alright here&#039;s the deal.... I&#039;ve been here 3 weeks and all I&#039;ve managed to order is 5 strips of nBOMe so far. The ONLY reason I even ordered that was to see how this works, and If It would actually come. Yes, I&#039;m a newb I have never hallucinated In my life and tbh only plan on doing 1 strip and giving the rest away If they get here safely. Thing Is I just put my LAST and I do mean my LAST 200$ (Like 260 now) I have Into this shit.<br /><br />My plan Is to buy cheap on here and then flip IRL. This Is how I support a fiancee and 3 yr old the way It Is and I&#039;m payin full price down here. I am literally buying an oz of weed for 100 and sellin It within the day to make a 40$ profit.... FUCK THAT! I have the customers I just can&#039;t catch a fuckin break down here (southern u.s.a.) I&#039;m bustin my ass every day for hardly nothing.... and then I found Silk Road! <br /><br />But here&#039;s the problem I ran into. The BEST deal that I have seen on here (or irl for that matter) will not answer they&#039;re messages and are apparently on vacation. The other GREAT deals require me to do at least 5 prior transactions.... Well I&#039;m not gonna explain my situation, but I have got to place a fuckin order by monday and get this shit goin. I can&#039;t wait any longer, way to many people are depending on me and god knows how long It&#039;ll take to get here once I decide what to get. So I&#039;m gonna give you some street prices of some shit where I&#039;m at and Hopefully you&#039;ll share some tips/deals with me on how to flip my last 260$.<br /><br /><br />Reggie A.K.A. Dirt, skunk,mids,(regular ass weed) 30-40 a quarter 90-140 a zip....<br /><br />Xanax bars go for 4-6 a pop<br /><br />Percocet 10s- 6-8 a piece<br /><br />Molly/MDMA- 100-130 a gram<br /><br />Lortab 10s- 5-7 a piece.....<br /><br />Roxi 30s- pretty much a dollar a mg so at the high 30 at the low 20<br /><br />Powder-80-100 a G<br /><br />As you can probably see prices are ridiculous here so this site Is a blessing for me. I have plenty of customers for almost anything but It seems like everytime I find something good on here, something goes wrong....I have no Interest In personal use I just wanna make profit, please either pm or post some deals that can help me. Something needs to happen now or I&#039;m In trouble. I can sell almost anything I can get my hands on (SR) and double, maybe even triple the proffit where I live. Please help Idk what else to do :(

				The list of drugs you posted are popular all over the world on every street corner. The last place you need to be to find a DEAL or NOT get screwed is the NEWBIE forum board on Silkroad. Pay attention, read and use common sense. If it is too good to be true then it is. Raise your post count and get the hell out of the NEWBIE board to buy gear. The only thing you&#039;ll find on the NEWBIE board are most likely scams. Suite yourself buddy.

				You have this illusion that I&#039;m stupid because I&#039;m new.... I&#039;ve done my research and I&#039;m just trying to get SUGGESTIONS (keyword suggestions) on good investments with 260$. I understand your a hardass that runs the online drug market so share some wisdom with me instead of telling me the same thing I&#039;ve read since I been here.
