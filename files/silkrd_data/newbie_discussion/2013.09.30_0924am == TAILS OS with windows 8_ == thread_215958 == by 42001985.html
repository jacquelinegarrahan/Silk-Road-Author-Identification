				Hello, I have ran into a little problem with installing tails on my windows 8 laptop. I have been following the tutorial on the &quot;security&quot; board but I seem to have a compatibility issue with windows 8. I have tried to boot the tails ISO from a usb (written via &quot;universal usb installer&quot;) and it keeps saying &quot;boot failed&quot; or something along the lines of that and just starts back up the windows 8. I also have it burned to a disc (using some iso burner) but Its not booting from that either, it just loads up windows 8. I think the problem may lie with the UEFI settings that windows 8 has. I turned off secure boot and was going to enable legacy boot but the OS alerted me that it may cause the windows OS not to load anymore. I dont want to disable it and lose my windows just to be able to have tails. what do you think I should do? I have 2 8gb flash drives and blank dvd-r&#039;s. sorry if this has been asked a million times I couldnt find what i was looking for using search. Thanks

				Windows 8 is a shit for this. my tails still wouldn&#039;t boot after i turned secure boot. in the end i had to disable the hard drive in the bios to get it to boot, and re-enable the hard drive afterwards to get back into Windows. it&#039;s a pain in the arse but every Windows 8 machine i&#039;ve tried it on i&#039;ve had to do the same thing

				wondows hate has some type of protection that wont allow another operating system to be installed..&nbsp; I wasted money on a new computer specifically for use here on the road only to find after&nbsp; 3 days that while it is possible that it is not likely to get done with out have an engineers degree in software programming.<br /><br />Google windows 8 and tails and you find what looks like suspicious road blocks&nbsp; as if MS is removing google references to tails&nbsp; &nbsp;even tails forum are shut down,<br /><br />Forum<br />&nbsp;<br />Download<br />Tails 0.20.1<br />September 19, 2013<br />About<br />Getting startedâ€¦<br />Documentation<br />Help &amp; Support<br />Contribute<br />This forum is closed<br />Given the amount of daily work Tails requires, we are unfortunately not able to properly take care of this forum at the same time as we are preparing the migration to a Questions &amp; Answers web site that will be better suited for user support.<br /><br />So, we have decided to close down the forum in its current form, and instead focus on getting something better ready as soon as possible.<br /><br />There are still a few support options left... and many ways to contribute :)<br /><br />Search the forum archives<br />

				I should add that the search is not over..&nbsp; I am really suprised that I don&#039;t see much uproar over the new UEFI in lieu of BIOS.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m going to linux now to see what I can find,&nbsp; to the OP - thank s for reminding me about this,<br /><br /><br />Here is a little tid bit .. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess this might be related to the fact (and someone please correct me if I am wrong) that Windows 8 is installed with UEFI keys, so you may not be able to boot using an OS other than Windows 8.<br /><br />I hear that there is a way to obtain valie UEFI keys from linux.org which enable people to boot &quot;Windows 8&quot; machines using Linux systems like Tails, but I haven&#039;t tried this and know very little about it. I hope someone who does will help out!
