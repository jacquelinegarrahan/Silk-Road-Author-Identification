				I have done blow off and on for a long time, stopped completely for around 8 years and only have done it about 5 times in the last few years, if that. But I always get the worst come down, the worst 2 second urge to do more. The coke here is shit, complete shit. Feel like shit the nesxt day, etc. I have done good blow a few times years and years ago, without those feelings. <br /><br />I am going to get a ball of the best stuff (reviewed) I can find here, a few friends (about 6 total) want to party soon. What do you guys use to &quot;come down&quot; safely? Is the quality of the coke the reason for all of the shitty feelings associtated? lol I assume since the good stuff doesn&#039;t do that. Just wanted advice on how to make it the best exoericnee possible and not wanting to call off for a week the next day lol.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks!!!!

				I&#039;d have to say my experiences/experience are pretty damn similar to yours.&nbsp; On and off use for 10+yrs and its my favorite drug besides for weed.&nbsp; I often get a cold/sickness after a night of hard partying but I&#039;d like to think its mostly from taking it too far or not treating my body with proper rest/hydration/diet.&nbsp; Its definitely not the only drug that takes a toll on my immune system as mdma does too.&nbsp; When I&#039;ve got some coke around once I start I cant stop till the absolute last &quot;acceptable&quot; moment.&nbsp; Did this to myself on a Thursday night a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Finally put it away around 2am, fell asleep around 4am, woke up at 8am thinking why the fuck did I do that.&nbsp; It was hot all day that Friday and I could smell the shit just seeping out of my pores even after two showers(before and after sleep).<br /><br />cliff notes: party hard feel like shit, party with respect feel mostly ok.

				It&#039;s the cut that gives you the side effects, pure coke really isn&#039;t bad for you physically. Of course you will still come down from it and want more but you shouldn&#039;t have the runny nose afterwards or body aches. From what I&#039;ve seen there is some high grade on this site, probably 80 % + which I haven&#039;t seen on the street in years.
