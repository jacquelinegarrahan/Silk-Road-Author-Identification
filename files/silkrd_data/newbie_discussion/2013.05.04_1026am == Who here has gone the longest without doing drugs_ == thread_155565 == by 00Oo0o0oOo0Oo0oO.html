				Did a hectic dose of mushrooms (10 grams dry) a month ago and it blew my mind (ego death). <br /><br />Haven&#039;t touched any drugs since, apart from alcohol. <br /><br />Then again the only drugs I do is psychedelics.

				I occasionally drink, but that&#039;s about it. I stopped using drugs about 7-8 years ago. Since then I have been high on pain meds, but they were prescribed to me. I also tried smoking weed shortly after I got out of the military, but I found I don&#039;t like it any more. Either weed got a whole lot stronger in the last 12 years or my tolerance was just so low that I got too wasted off of a half of a bowl, but either way, I didn&#039;t like the way it made me feel.
