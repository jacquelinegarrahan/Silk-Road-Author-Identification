				On average, how long does it take to get your BTC into your account?<br />I sent some from bitbargain.co.uk almost 2 hours ago now and i&#039;m still told I have 0.00 credit&nbsp; :-\<br />If they never arrive, who do I take this up with? bitbargain?<br />Gah!

				In my opinion a problem on SR is better than something went wrong with your individual transaction. I did some research on the forums before getting worried and when the problem has been on SR&#039;s end and impacting everyone it gets fixed fast and then all the transactions post over the next couple of hours while if it&#039;s an individual issue you have to contact support, wait for them to wade through 500+ &quot;I sent by BTC 20 minutes ago and it&#039;s still not here WTF?&quot; emails and investigate those just to find out the BTC showed up 10 minutes later and they didn&#039;t even have the decency to follow up with a &quot;NM problems resolved&quot; reply before they get to yours. <br /><br />

				For anyone with delays getting coins in. Check the blockchain and look at the address you sent it to. Was that transaction confirmed? It must get to 6 confirmations before SR will even start to tumble it around and add it to your account.<br />If there is no fee on the transaction it CAN (but usually doesn&#039;t) take days to get its first confirmation. Typically a few hours. After that you need 5 more confirmations and then there is the SR introduced delay. If its been multiple (over 24?) hours after 6 confirmations on the transaction, then maybe ask support. Otherwise just keep waiting. imo

				At first, getting bitcoins can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Follow these instructions if you&#039;re in the USA:<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.
