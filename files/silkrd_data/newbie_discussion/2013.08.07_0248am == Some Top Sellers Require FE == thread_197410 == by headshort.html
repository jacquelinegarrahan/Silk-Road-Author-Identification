				I&#039;ve read that you should never FE before you get the package, but some bestsellers require that noobs do just that. I want to buy from the most reliable sellers but I worry about FEing. Are the top sellers on SR trusted enough to FE?

				Yes, I used to do it all the time as a buyer. It&#039;s a way they can make sure they are not scammed because the SR tends to favour the buyer.

				I made a bunch of small orders with reputable vendors - theanchor is a good one for hash/opium that ships extremely discretely from India.<br /><br />Once you have a few transactions I&#039;ve found that sellers are less likely to demand FE.

				There are enough vendors that don&#039;t require FE that you can make 10 purchases without doing it, and then you can expand to the other vendors. You really don&#039;t have to ever FE.

				NorCal420HookUp has cheaper listings for FE, but usually also offers Escrow for a bit more.&nbsp; <br /><br />The simplest answer is never FE... and you&#039;ll never get scammed.&nbsp; But, some buyers know that there are just two kinds of vendors.&nbsp; Professionals, and Opportunists.&nbsp; The Professionals stick around year after year, some require FE, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; The Opportunists, without saying, wait for the right opportunity, and take you for a ride.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to FE for someone, you better research them up and down before doing so.&nbsp; If you do not see something in these forums by a simple search of the vendor&#039;s name, then you know something is up.&nbsp; Next, if you&#039;re not seeing that others have also FE&#039;d and got their goods, then don&#039;t jump right in with that vendor.&nbsp; As stated, some vendors are opportunists.&nbsp; Be that a FE&#039;d package getting snagged by USPS, and them being like &quot;oh fuck&quot; and running off with your money... never to be heard from again; or by them maybe getting overwhelmed, or feeling some kind of &#039;heat&#039; and wanting to plan an early retirement.&nbsp; You just don&#039;t know.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a touchy subject since the dawn of these discussion boards from what I&#039;ve gathered.&nbsp; I know a handful of trusted FE vendors, and if you look them up you will see nothing but rave reviews on these boards for them.&nbsp; Again, if you don&#039;t or can&#039;t find much on a particular vendor requesting or requiring FE... don&#039;t buy from them, period.<br /><br />Another thing to mention is that the &quot;Report Vendor&quot; button is far less effective at bringing something to the attention of the Silk Road Administrators.&nbsp; If you have an issue, or see something that clearly breaks the &#039;rules&#039; set forth in the SR Vendor Wiki, then by all means contact username: &quot;SR Support&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a link at the bottom of the SR page(s) that says &quot;Support&quot;; this is the same thing as contacting &quot;SR Support&quot; directly.&nbsp; It is also set as a Vendor account, so you can &#039;fan/favorite&#039; them as well if that&#039;s better for you. <br /><br />I recommend reporting ALL vendors &quot;Requiring FE&quot; on any listing, big or small, if they have less than 35 transactions.&nbsp; That&#039;s how 75% of scams here start.&nbsp; The other 25% are Selective, or Opportunistic &#039;retirement&#039; or &#039;fuck it&#039; scams.&nbsp; ???

				I would advise against finalizing early - even SR staff advises against it. You basically lose all protection, and you lose all your Bitcoins and can only hope a package will show up. If a vendor asks you to FE, I say find another vendor. I would rather stay in escrow with a mediocre vendor than FE for a reputable one.

				canadiandrugs usually rquires fe because most sales are express and at your door canada 2 days max and usa 4 days . with my sale pricing added i require fe, i never dishonored an order, if it was sent and tracking show it made it then nothing i can do. only once it went off grid during tracking, that was customers fault tried to give vacant houses&nbsp; address so mail person left note pick up at postal station and they panicked thinking controlled delivery, when it was their own dumb fault. <br />i sell opiates and benzo with sale on up to 50% off regular pricing. i have been around almost 1 yr im not in it to scam someone, i make money from repeat bulk customers, in my best interest to get product to customer. <br />i would not fe on any vendor less than 6-9 months old. they have been around for all the big issues like mt john, btc crash, all the other scammers which several i called then out and was correct. <br />because i offer an excellent product at even lower prices and require fe does not make me a scammer. <br />you get your product quick, i need to get the bitcoins out fast, this is where we loose all the money, even if&nbsp; we hedge it. cashing out can cost 20-40% depending how fast you want it, thats a big hit. ADD IN&nbsp; btc fluctuation you want to liquidate ASAP. .

				i have FEd a few times although i hate doing it, i am a good customer, its too bad they cant have better &quot;stats&quot; for everyone. As soon as i receive a package i unwrap it, shred anything that can identify anyone, check out product and then log in and finalize the deal. Too many people fuck up the process with excuses, getting high before finalizing, etc. Here are the best vendors i have done business with (in no order)....................................hatter26(awesome service, will be missed), tentoes, marlostanfield, jamesbrown,&nbsp; USG,&nbsp; Daruthless1,SixDimensions ,Addyqueenhashking, Nicedeal, dragoncove.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of those above, DaRuthless1, Addyqueen, and dragoncove asked me to FE, DaRuthless and Addyqueen gave awesome service when i did FE, dragoncove i just ordered from so no opinion yet, but hope to get product soon. ONE VENDOR named GOOD DRUGS asked me to FE and never sent anything,( he was banned quick, had i read forums better i would have known not to order from him as he was scamming .) SOOOOOOO, actually i have received WAY better service from those vendors who DO NOT ask for you too FE, in my opinion it is better to deal with vendors that dont demand that you FE. The whole demanding for FE just delays the order, delays the shipping, and delays you getting your product while the shipper can take there sweet time sending what you have paid for. For example my recent order i placed on sunday, i got a demand for FE on monday mourning, i said ok cause its a trusted vendor, now monday night its still not marked in transit so i cannot FE, tuesday morning still no response, now i just came home from work tuesday afternoon and now its marked in transit so vendor is asking me to FE, which i do. Now when will i get my product??? probably 2 to 3 day shipping, which makes it probably Thursday BUT probably FRIDAY. Ok NOW with out the FE BULLSHIT, Order is placed Sunday, vendor drops in mail monday mourning, 2-3 day shipping i receive it wed- thursday and vendor gets paid. I am much happier getting my product faster and will order again from vendor. I understand vendors have risk sending out product but i as a customer would like to get my shit ASAP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can we get a list of trusted customers somehow?????????????? i for one am sick of getting my orders delayed by the FE delaying all the time, i have no problem FEing for trusted vendors, but shit dont sit on my order waiting on FE. Sorry just needed to vent, i&nbsp; finalize ASAP and get fucking tired of FEing and having to wait on my orders.

				noob accounts are always risky since it could just be a scammer who opened a new account for a new attempt at a scam.<br /><br />if youre gonna fe, start with a small order that way if you get scammed, youre only out a little bit.<br /><br />and try ordering from a vendor that you&#039;ll do repeat business with, that way you build a history with him/her and won&#039;t have to fe anymore which in turn builds your purchasing stats with other vendors.
