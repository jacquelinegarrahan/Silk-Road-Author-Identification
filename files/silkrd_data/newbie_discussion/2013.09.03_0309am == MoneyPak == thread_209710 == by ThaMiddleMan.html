				Why are MoneyPaks so popular ? when there are other ways to buy the coin ? Walgreens and CVS has Vanilla , there is Reloadits and some new one jus came out, but as a Vendor I struggle with MoneyPaks since they block and lock me out so quick trying to cash these things.&nbsp; Any reason why the love of Moneypaks over Reloadits ? <br /><br />TMM

				Likely because MP&#039;s are the most widely available and well known reload card. Lot&#039;s of scamming going on with MP&#039;s.

				Yes there is alot of scams with them, thats why I load them to the credit card , then go cash the card at the ATM then send coins , but seems everyone asks do I accept MP , and Green Dot has locked me out of 5 cards so far, MP are jus a pain mainly, trying to get people to switch over to Vanilla or Netspend Reloadits

				I&#039;ve also been wondering how to get around the zip code requirement that Greensnot requires. It&#039;s coming to where I won&#039;t be taking them any longer.

				only site I know of that does not require a zip is PayPal , but I hate cashing out there , takes days to get your cash, also after so much action PayPAl will refuse your business there.&nbsp; Green Dot Im not sure whats wrong with them, guess they dont want to make money, they have locked me out of 7 cards now, I have more coming in the mail from different companys, but it will only be a short time before im locked out there also.<br /><br />Green Dot SUCKS , stay away from them , take it from a vendor they are not worth the hassle.&nbsp; They jus want you to buy there cards , load the cash on there and not cash out.&nbsp; They have so many rules to hurdle it is really not worth the trouble, but everyone loves buying them for BTC <br /><br />After these next cards get locked up , ill be done wit MP for sure <br />

				I was reading on an onion that MP has limits they don&#039;t openly talk about.<br /><br />They don&#039;t want you to put in more than $1500 within 24 hours, $2500 within a week or more than $5000 in a month.<br /><br />I think there&#039;s just an education that needs to happen. Start talking about Vanilla more and more and hopefully people will switch over.

				I feel like they are quicker and easier. I have had issues before with it being locked and some buyers resell their moneypacks which makes it a little more frustrating so I might try different methods of doing business.
