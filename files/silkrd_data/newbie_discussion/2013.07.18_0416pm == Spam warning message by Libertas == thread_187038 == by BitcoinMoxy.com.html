				Just got this private message:<br /><br />&quot;Consider this your first and only warning; if you spam these forums again your account will be deleted without any further dialogue on the matter.<br /><br />Libertas&quot;<br /><br />Thought it was ok to post to &quot;Spam here get to 50&quot; threads as I see everyone doing it?<br />Or is that an automated response?<br /><br />cheers (I&#039;m panicking here and absolutely worried that my account may be terminated!)<br /><br />

				Well there was a spike in spam earlier for a couple of hours so that may have contributed, also the topic of whether it will get you banned has come up in other threads in recent hours so possibly that has also contributed.

				it&#039;s more than likely something has made the Gods think you are using an alias (+ the name bitcoinmoxy.com would set off a few flags) &amp; are guilty of demonstrating similar behaviour previously or caused a drama.. But if that honestly doesn&#039;t apply to you, then I agree that it is indeed strange to receive that msg. even moreso because it shows you only have 4 posts? Lol did they delete all the &#039;spam to 50&#039; comments you made? I have been racking my posts up pretty quickly, but I switchup which threads to post in &amp; try contribut whatever I can with least amount of letters haha good luck mate ;)

				what they mean to say is &quot;ramble here to get to 50&quot;. not actual spam. but even your username is spam. spam incarnate. that&#039;s why you&#039;re being singled out.

				My guess is this is somewhat automated, and based on your username it probably seems like you&#039;re one of the &#039;scammer spammers&#039;.

				I&#039;m posting the content of the message I sent you in response to your question in order to clarify the situation for others:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=76616">Quote from: BitcoinMoxy.com on July 18, 2013, 04:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is this an automated message?<br /><br />I have been posting to the &quot;Spam here to get past the newbie restriction&quot; threads only, as many are doing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, it&#039;s not an automated message.<br /><br />We have no way of knowing if you&#039;re running a scam site or not and due to the nature of Tor are regularly targeted by spammers advertising Bitcoin scam sites, which people unfortunately do fall for. Spamming your bitcoinmoxy.com link all over the place makes you look like one of those scammers. Having reviewed your posts it seems you are aiming for something more legitimate, and you are, of course, entitled to completely free speech here as long as you&#039;re not plastering the boards with the same message (which, again, at first glance looks like a scam due to the nature of the content and the style of posting) - feel free to start one or two threads advertising your services, and &#039;spam to 50&#039; in the newbie threads but please do not plaster your site link all over the forum.<br /><br />Libertas
