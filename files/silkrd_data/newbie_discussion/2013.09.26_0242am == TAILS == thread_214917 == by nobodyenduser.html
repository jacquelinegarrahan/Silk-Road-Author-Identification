				I&#039;d bet on anywhere from 10 to 45 min.<br />You&#039;re calculating the sig for an entire disc full of tail.<br />I&#039;d expect at least 45min - personally. I&#039;d just set it - go do some other shit, and come back later.

				A PGP signature is a signature of the checksum of the file rather than the entire file in order to avoid a giant signature and much more expensive signing math.<br /><br />The speed at which your system calculates a checksum is likely bottlenecked by your hard drive rather than your CPU if your computer is reasonably modern.<br /><br />

(just don&#039;t be on the same server/site with both at the same time)<br /><br />You&#039;re going to have to search for the exploit files, not sure why it&#039;s so difficult to find now.&nbsp; That or ask on the security forum and maybe someone will know.<br />
