				Hey guys, i am in no way an opiate Nieve individual, and i have been on suboxone for almost 2 years at 12mg a day. i am in a bit of a heroin binge for a few weeks now, with no suboxone.<br /><br />My issue is that normally I stick to the #4 heroin because my preferred ROA is snorting. I stumbled on Einstein777s&#039; listing for 1.25 grams of gunpowder bth and I had the exact amount of bitcoins to get it with express shipping! It was like a sign!<br /><br />According to the pic, and my idea of what &quot;gunpowder bth&quot; sounds like, I&#039;m guessing its half powder half chunks, kinda like pebbles of #4.<br /><br />Is my assumption correct? Can I throw it under a bill, crush it own, scrape into lines, and snort? Or did I make a bad choice of product for my ROA...<br /><br />I know his stuff has to be good given the ratings, I live on the east coast so I am a stranger to bth, mainly because its on the west coast, and secondly it&#039;s a pain to snort, if at all possible. <br /><br />Please let me know what u guys think, and if any of you have gotten his stuff to snort please share your experience!<br /><br />Thanks guys and gals!<br />- Lster

				Last time I tried E777&#039;s H it was a sticky tar, which was a week ago. For your preferred ROA it won&#039;t work but if you look up &quot;monkey water&quot; that will be a similar ROA.

				ill help you out...put that shit up your butt. but seriously. snorting bth is a bitch even if it is mixed with number 4.&nbsp; <br /><br />but if your determined to try and snort it i can help you out. because you might end up getting precipted up bth.. if it does come as a goopy mess you have a few options.<br />1. freeze it(for 10-13mins) in the bag it comes in take it out and hammer that shit. it should shatter. break out into lines/injoy.<br />2. putting under a heat lamp is another option <br />3. i have heard of a method (untested grounds) of putting on a microwavable plate adding a small bit of water . then rubbing around into as thin as possible puddle(key here i believe was to keep it as thick as possible) then microwaving for very small amounts of time. personally as i said i never attempted this one because microwave plus my dope just aint happening. <br />4. honestly the only way i go. buy a syringe. cook up dope as if you were about to shoot it ( this way you filter out alota crap) use as little water as possible .then break off the needle so you dont stick the inside of ur nose. VERY SLOWLY drop a couple drops/small squirts into ur nose/enjoy.&nbsp; &nbsp; you can still do a rinse without the needle. and you will prolly want to. i still say you should do all this and just put it in ur butt. but thats up to you.

				I ordered the gunpowder. The gunpowder will also turn sticky on you if you live in a humid area or it&#039;s warm.
