				You are really the only one that can fix this.&nbsp; You should make sure to research any potential vendors on the SR forums before purchasing.&nbsp; There are many great vendors who hangout on the forums and respond back to their customers to make sure they are completely satisfied with their product and also are actively reviewed without moderator access.&nbsp; Look for vendors that do this and you will likely solve the problems you just brought up.&nbsp; Unfortunately in such an anonymous environment it is going to be difficult to hold people accountable so we always have to be cautious not to get scammed when trying new vendors.&nbsp;

				I am not a vendor so I cannot say for sure but I believe I was told that vendors are able to see a rating system much as we have for them and how much money we have spent on SR.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe they can see detailed information about your purchases since that would be also allowing LE to simply make a vendor account and be able to simply snoop on your potentially illegal activities with a transaction report.&nbsp; That just wouldn&#039;t make sense seeing as everything else is so anonymous.&nbsp;

				Vendors can see your purchasing stats, which look like:<br />Recent purchasing statistics<br /><br />Total transactions: 16<br />Total spent: $21983.46<br />Refund rate: 0.32%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months

				Choose your vendors wisely and you will be well rewarded. I am still waiting on my first couple of purchases to ship but having had contact with the vendors I am confident they will come through. Good luck!

				I am new to this SR but new to the market.&nbsp; I am only trying this out to find more buyers of bulk BC Bud.&nbsp; I do not and will not use bitcoins.&nbsp; Does this SR actually put bigger players together?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not about personal use sales.

				Then you have found the wrong place all together.&nbsp; SR does allow for &quot;bigger players&quot; to get together and conduct business but that would require you to have a vendor account and use BitCoin&#039;s since that is the currency used to protect the anonymity of the users.&nbsp; SR doesn&#039;t just setup weed deals for you, you have to build up clientele that trusts you and your product, likely from smaller &quot;personal use sales&quot; or by slashing prices early on to get people to try your product rather than the other 1,000 + options already available.&nbsp; &nbsp;
