				Knowing that plausible deniability is what we buyers are leaning on......are there ANY reports of someone being served a CD and declining to sign?&nbsp; I know that&#039;s common knowledge, not to sign but has that actually been tested by anyone?<br /><br />If it really is as simple as &quot;dont ever sign anything&quot; then I would expect to find a few stories here and there where this was put into practice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched and searched but can&#039;t find anything.<br /><br />Anyone know of any REAL cases where this saved the buyer?

				Read about one on here the other day actually, can&#039;t remember the link though. <br /><br />Odds of them doing a CD for a small (personal) amount: minimal<br />If they do, fuck &#039;em. Don&#039;t sign. Don&#039;t admit to shit.<br /><br />Odds are, they aren&#039;t going to waste the time, money, man hours, forensics, etc to charge someone with a half oz of weed or a few pills. And even if they do decide to go that route and you haven&#039;t admitted to shit, the burden of proof is on them to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you actually placed the order and/or had knowledge of it being sent. Anyone can send anything to anyone else in the mail without them knowing it. <br /><br />Now, if you&#039;re moving into re-distribution amounts, that&#039;s a totally different story. But you wouldn&#039;t be on here asking about CD&#039;s if you were moving that&nbsp; kind of weight...you&#039;d already have your plan a, b, c, d and e in effect.

				I am still curious if it&#039;s been tested or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve never read a story like &quot;I was served a CD, didn&#039;t sign, and they went away&quot; but maybe they are out there and I just haven&#039;t found them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have, however, read lots of stories of people speculating about it.&nbsp; Everybody pretty much understands it and how it is supposed to work.&nbsp; But does it really work that way?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think if they are trying to serve a CD then they aren&#039;t going to walk away empty handed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just can&#039;t imagine little piggies coming (with a warrant and CD in hand) being turned around and sent home because of a refusal to sign.<br /><br />I think, more than likely, you&#039;d be arrested anyway and have to fight it out in court.&nbsp; &nbsp;For many on SR, an arrest has the same result as a conviction (fucked up life) so this seems like a topic worth discussing.<br />

				Yeah. There was an AMA on reddit /r/silkroad recently of a college kid getting a CD. Search for it, don`t feel like linking.
