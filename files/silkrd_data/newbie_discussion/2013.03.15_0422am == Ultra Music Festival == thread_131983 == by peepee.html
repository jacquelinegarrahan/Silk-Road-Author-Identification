				You know people kept telling me I should go to this music festival and that one. The most attractive thing to me was the easy access to any drug I could ever want. But now that I&#039;m on Silk Road that point seems moot.<br /><br />To the cool cats that have experienced this before, should I go anyways? I won&#039;t lie, the atmosphere seems amazing. LOVE EVERYWHERE. A great contrast to everyday life =)

There were people all over offering &quot;molly&quot;. I am glad that I have friends down there and met good people. I made the mistake of buying off a guy who was staying at my hotel. He told me not to eat more then 2 of the pills, which of course around 6am I dropped a 3rd one after blasting a line and eating another &quot;molly&quot; that I purchased off a cab driver while drunk. The combination put me in a really bad place. Crazy thoughts and disorientation. My heart was pounding, cold sweats etc..Recollecting the episode, I remember feeling like my conscious was leaving from the pineal glad area. Very weird; I defiantly had an out of body experience. Really learned my lesson not to buy shit off of random people. I usually test but didn&#039;t bring my reagent on the trip.

				Be careful there!! got arrested there 3 years ago. Was sitting in on a little grassy spot talking to some kids was about to rip some k and an undercover came up and put his hand on my shoulder and told me if i moved he&#039;d break my nose. Got swarmed by about 10 undercovers. Arrested 12 of us all at once. It was because some kid was showing these other kids some trees. I had two zips of k work on me all in gram and half grams. as soon as they came up and they werent looking i put it all in my boxers. They zip tied us all together and walked us out to some command station type shit beside the stage. i managed to shake all the work out of my shorts while we were walking so someone got a FATTY groundscore!! All i got busted with was the line i had in a dollar bill in front of me. Spent 3 days in dade county and got bailed out. paid 1000$ for a lawyer and got &#039;1 day probation&#039;. so it didnt come out all that bad but lost a decent bit of money especially having to drop the work better than the years i would have been spending in FL though. Met some other people that had got caught there and they were getting them for some stupid shit. So my Ultra experience lasted about a total of 15 min. Hopefully yours is better!! not trying to scare anyone away just saying watch your ass if your partying the undercovers looked just like everyone else.

Spent 3 days in dade county and got bailed out. paid 1000$ for a lawyer and got &#039;1 day probation&#039;. so it didnt come out all that bad but lost a decent bit of money especially having to drop the work better than the years i would have been spending in FL though. Met some other people that had got caught there and they were getting them for some stupid shit. So my Ultra experience lasted about a total of 15 min. Hopefully yours is better!! not trying to scare anyone away just saying watch your ass if your partying the undercovers looked just like everyone else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn dude that shit does scare me haha but it just helps me keep an eye out. Alot of undercovers are obvious but the ones that look just like us is what I am scared of. I guess its just a matter of being extra carefull I wish they werent so strict in festivals and events these days its so annoying everyones going to do drugs no matter what ..theyre not worried about the drugs they just see it as a big opportunity for the city to make money off of us when were in trouble. Last year was my first time to EDC Vegas and they had a cop with a dog upfront and I got scared after what people were telling me about the drug dogs there. I went out of those rediculous lines and to my car ..popped two mollies left the rest there ..the high was intense on those lines haha BUT turned out the &quot;drug dogs&quot; were bullshit they were just up there for show. Stupid me.

				One thing that I don&#039;t like about festivals like ultra is the fact that they are not on private land.

I spoke with him before placing the order; very easy to deal with and shares my appreciation for the chemical.Armin has gotten very popular; I remember seeing him at Spirit NYC in 2004 for the first time. I&nbsp; always try to catch his events when they come around, because he knows how to spin a complete set.

Just take some 5 HTP, and give a day break in between. I went on an e binge when I was on Ibiza; rolled every night for 7 days straight. I will never do anything like that again. You will never be faced like the first dose. I am also not retarded from the experience, but I was out of it for a few days afterwards. If you read the cited study for which many people rely upon to assert that MDMA &quot;puts holes in your brain&quot;, you can see in the abstract/methods that the rats were given super high doses for days on end to cause neurotoxicity

The third day you are really just pushing your brain to produce serotonin when its really burnt out at that point and needs time to recover and reproduce. I rolled for two days at umf last week and tripped for one day ... Richie Hawtin and shrooms was the best!!!<br />UMF was amazing btw ..the mega structure was my home for all three days and the weather was fucking beutifull!!

Hopefully its not a repeat of EZOO, ezoo is so shitty, almost as shitty as Ultra.&nbsp; I mean dont get me wrong, there were too many rude people, and too many people that didnt belong to the scene, and that really sucked.&nbsp; I hope festis like Burning Man dont eventually turn into what ultra is.&nbsp; Def an experience, and everyone should go, Ultra was the first festival ive been to that had such AMAZING lineups, and breathtaking sets!!!! Best part of Ultra, I must say, SECURITY WERENT CHECKING FOR SHIIIIT! They barely peaked into book bags and purses, and they tapped front pockets of shorts once and super briefly if barely touching.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes! I totally agree with you! I&#039;m really going to edc ny because its just here aand for good old house music not the other bullshit they play these days.. it usually attracts the better crowd as well. All music festivals now are full of people who dont even listen to the music and just go because of the hype and drugs and theyre all so rude and pushy and attention whores. Edc ny and Ezoo have the shittiest and nastiest crowds that Ive seen so far. The people at Ultra and Edc vegas really were not as bad. Edc does have to minimize their security checking tho, thats why their lines were rediculous.

				The line-ups at the larger US electronic music festivals have been pretty bad this year. However, I don&#039;t like trance and dub-step, so that pretty much limits my interest on who I want to see in a line-up (I like garage/uk bass/deep house/footwork/techno/tech-house artists). I&#039;m older too, so I don&#039;t like going to a festival where everyone is 5-10 years younger than me. Don&#039;t let that deter you younger kids from going. If I was 18, just starting to get into EDM and EDC was in my backyard, I&#039;d probably have the best time of my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, the only festivals of interest for me this year are in Croatia (Unsound &amp; Hideout Festival), but I can&#039;t take the time off work to go. They look so awesome though. However, the thought of flying internationally with drugs is pretty scary. I know a lot of people that went to BPM this year and brought crap loads of drugs with them to Mexico. But, that would suck if they had gotten caught. Mexican jail is no joke.

When you fly into the country, you walk up to a pseudo stop light, push a button, and if it turns red, you have your bags searched...Estoy Gringo No Problemo!.While traveling on spring break a few years ago, I brought an oz of cannabis with me (obviously Mexican weed is complete shit) and a few E pills with no problems. Personal amounts of drugas are legal in Mexico.If the worst happened ,you can always break out the greenbacks.
