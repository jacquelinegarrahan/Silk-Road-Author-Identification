				If no one payed taxes then the US dollar would be as worthless as the paper it&#039;s printed on.&nbsp; The US dollar only has a value because it can be used to pay taxes and settle debts.&nbsp; If you couldn&#039;t do these things with US dollars then nobody would want them.<br /><br />I hate the United States government too brother.

				Tax evasion is a serious offense in most countries. Do you remit sales tax as required for your location? And if you don&#039;t, a lot of it can be reimbursed with what&#039;s known in Canada as an &#039;Input Tax Credit&#039;. If this applies to you, then you should pay your sales tax and use the remitted taxes for business expenses.<br /><br />Anyway, in the long run, you&#039;ll eventually get audited, and depending on the cashflow that is recorded in your paper trail, it could become a case of forensic accounting, where all transactions are observed and critiqued in detail in order to prosecute the evader for crimes. I find that small businesses (in Canada at least) have enough loopholes to evade lots of taxes. Lucky me! I try sell BTC for cash, but when I trade and deposit in my bank I usually remit sales tax from the larger transactions.

Say somebody has a small cleaning business, a registered LLC and say this person has never been a fan of the federal government and is sickened to see where income tax dollars go<br /><br />Tax Payer -&gt; Private Banksters -&gt; Funds wars, famine, prison planet.<br /><br />Say this person believes in God and also believes whole-heartedly the he is watching the book of Revelation unfold right before his eyes and the sick Satanist freaks at the top such as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are Modern day Canaanites (Synagogue of Satan, Satan&#039;s seed) and are being used by Satan to prepare the world to be led by the Anti-Christ (New World Order, One World Govt) <br /><br />Knowing all this, paying an unconstitutional tax such as income tax to these monstrous thieves is simply not an option.<br />Now this registered LLC small business has existed for 3 or 4 years now and no tax paperwork has ever been filed. There is a bank account associated with business&#039;s tax ID and 90% of the payments are in checks written to the business (about $400-600 a week in good months, $100-300/week in bad months) <br /><br />Would kind of eventual outcome is this business owner looking at? All information is appreciated.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oy vey! Look, I&#039;m no fan of the government, and I do think they overreach quite a bit, but that&#039;s just too much.<br /><br />Tax payer -&gt; Government agency -&gt; Funds various wars, corruption, and violations of civil liberties, but also provides useful services like roads and transportation, public safety, clean water, subsidized food, aid to the poor and disabled, park lands, etc. <br /><br />The list of good an bad things done by the government could go on for days.<br /><br />As an atheist, I can&#039;t lend credence to the Satanic theories. And any given tax payer&#039;s religious views are irrelevant to how the government operates. Separation of church and state.<br /><br />&quot;paying an unconstitutional tax such as income tax&quot;<br />You need to brush up on the Constitution. The Constitution itself gives congress the power to levy taxes and the 16th Amendment legally established the IRS and the collection of income tax. Not unconstitutional. At all.<br /><br />&quot;Would kind of eventual outcome is this business owner looking at? All information is appreciated.&quot;<br />In all seriousness, prison, hefty fines and penalties, and wage garnishment. Liens against any property owned by the business owner. An LLC is legally treated like a partnership. It is not a corporation, the owners can be held personally reliable. If you&#039;re asking because this applies to you, you should probably contact an attorney. <br /><br />It&#039;s even worse that everything is paid by check. That leaves a major paper trail. It&#039;s like buying something on silk road with a credit card.<br /><br />I hate the government as much as the next person, but there are a few good things that come form taxes.<br /><br />And you don&#039;t get to pick and choose where your tax dollars are spent. That would be chaos. <br /><br />The way that you get to make that decision is by voting. That&#039;s the only say in the matter that anyone can or should have.<br /><br />I&#039;m all about anarchy (I wouldn&#039;t be here if I weren&#039;t), but you have to recognize that you are 100% on your own you get no help from anyone in that scenario.<br /><br />You&#039;re free to relocate to a country with lower taxes or where your tax dollars are spent more to your agreement. There&#039;s some countries in the Caribbean and Central/South America with beautiful weather (and even hotter women). Staying in the US and paying US taxes is a choice.<br /><br />Notice that I&#039;m not arguing with you about the government being crooked or corrupt. On that, wars, and incarceration we agree.<br /><br /><br />

				Well said hate scam!<br /><br />In a perfect world... <br /><br />Unfortunately the delicate nature of a nation&#039;s sociopolitical governance, leaves lots of room for even small actions and changes to exaggerate themselves in practice. For better or for worse.

Also don&#039;t forget that there&#039;s a department of education within the executive branch. Federal tax dollars go to financial aid (either grants or in guaranteeing of loans). Those are just small examples.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget Amtrak and the USPS; neither one is completely self-sufficient. The federal government also subsidizes mass transit in major cities (e.g. NYC subway system).<br /><br />Then there are agricultural subsidies. The EPA and their monitoring and protection services, the National Park System, and the DOJ (AG, SG + all US attorneys) and the federal court system all require funding to operate. Every executive branch agency has to be funded with tax dollars appropriated by congress. Without appropriation, all of the workers would be furloughed and the agency would be shuttered until receiving more funding.<br /><br />SOME of the total income tax receipts are used for paying interest on the national debt, but they&#039;re not making any payments on the principal balance.<br /><br />Some of the money is temporarily going toward making up the current short fall for Social Security.<br /><br />And people who work for the government need to be paid. the government still has to pay for utilities and in some cases rent.<br /><br />Taxes also go toward welfare, food stamps, section 8 housing vouchers, medicaid, earned income tax credit/mortgage interest deduction/child tax credit (those are all refundable tax credits), etc. Many of these programs are administered by the states, but the federal government picks up most of the tab.<br /><br />There are many other programs that the federal government funds; please don&#039;t make me list them all.<br /><br />The bulk of payroll taxes are not federal income tax. Social Security and Medicare taxes make up the biggest chunk of the federal tax bill for wage earners.<br /><br /><br />&quot;There has got to be lots of small licensed companies that only bring in minimum wages that forgo filing&quot;<br />-----Yes. And that&#039;s OK legally. There is a minimum threshold for taxation. If you fall below that threshold, you aren&#039;t required to file at all. Most LLC&#039;s profits are filed on an individuals return (i.e. 1040); they&#039;re not filed as a corporation generally.<br /><br />But if you ACTUALLY OWE taxes, you&#039;re in trouble IF you haven&#039;t paid them and IF you get caught. You can file your return late, but you MUST pay your taxes on time to avoid harsh penalties.<br /><br />LLC owners shouldn&#039;t complain about taxes because they aren&#039;t double taxed as corporations can be. A CEO pays income taxes and his corporation pays taxes on the same money by paying him. LLC&#039;s profits as personal income.<br /><br />And if your business is incurring losses, you should definitely be filing taxes. Even if the tax credit isn&#039;t refundable, it can be carried over and applied to the next year&#039;s tax bill.<br /><br />&quot;Plus the sixteenth amendment was never properly ratified&quot;<br />-----I&#039;ve heard the argument about the 16th amendment before. It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve heard it, but I&#039;ve heard it nonetheless. The fact is, it&#039;s the law of the land (whether by statute or de facto).<br /><br />If you believe that to be the case, then the proper thing to do would be to lobby congress. Start with your congressman(woman) and your senators.<br /><br />There are plenty of people who share your POV on this; form a group, a PAC, a 501(c) and raise money to hire a lobbiest firm. Also, in a group, you can target multiple congresspeople and senators.<br /><br />So the answer is still to address the problem by voting and exercising your 1st Amendment right to express your opinion publicly and to assemble.<br /><br />EDIT: 36 States ratified the 16 Amendment. And it doesn&#039;t matter anyway, between 1913-2007, at least 7 court cases established that income taxation is constitutional and that the 16th Amendment is valid. Since it&#039;s enshrined in case law, it requires Supreme Court or Congressional action to change. Neither is likely, but you&#039;d have better luck lobbying congress than finding a case to appeal to SCOTUS<br /><br />
