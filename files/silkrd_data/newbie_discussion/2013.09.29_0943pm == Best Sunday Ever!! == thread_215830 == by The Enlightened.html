				Well folks, I hope you have had a fine weekend&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Me and 4 of my closest buddies have just had the most amazing DMT and Changa (a special order) night ever!.<br /><br />It was the new batch from Machine Elves and all I can say it it kicked all our our fucking asses into Hyperspace!!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />My first (of 3!!!) breakthrough&#039;s landed me right inside the workings of an alien spacecraft and was being shown around the workings whilst somehow feeling like I understood what I was seeing!!&nbsp; ??? ???<br /><br />The 2nd one had me face to face with these 2 (or 3) large paying mantis like creatures which were ominously unemotional, but seemed to be &quot;operating&quot; or at least checking me out in some way.....felt weird until I thought perhaps they are upgrading me!!<br /><br />The 3rd and final breakthrough trip for me was utterly blissful. It&nbsp; felt like i was being whisked around on some sort of &quot;silk made of light&quot; by winged beings, although I only seem to remember their wings and the translucent architecture they were showing me which was on a scale I had never seen before.&nbsp; <br /><br />A M A Z I N G. <br /><br />Each time, I felt the full return and &quot;re-align&quot; to my physical state and felt great.....So much has changed for me since meeting this product.<br /><br />As for my friends they had very similar experiences too and are currently sitting completely baffled/confounded chatting non-stop over a few joints! :P :P<br /><br />WHAT A NIGHT!!!&nbsp; ;D ;D 8) 8) ;D ;D<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend the MACHINE ELVES latest batch which we got 2x off : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7f87868c0d<br /><br />ALSO checkout their profile page AND BECOME A FAN, they love that!!! : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7076c26b1e<br /><br />Hope the week goes well for y&#039;all. 8)

				&nbsp;;D Thanks for the kind words.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It does seem that the word is getting around the UK DMT domestic market and we have had nothing but excellent feedback and many many interesting PM&#039;s.<br /><br />The best &quot;compliments&quot; have been the PM&#039;s (Obviously from competing Vendors&nbsp; ;D ) asking what &quot;the extra steps we use&quot; in our Unique Negative Extraction Process.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course our answer has always been the same, it&#039;s a &quot;TRADE SECRET&quot;!! <br /><br />It took us a lot (years) of experimenting as to when to apply our specific method of cooling (Neg Temp) during the adapted STB process we use.&nbsp; Let just say, it&#039;s not intuitive&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />We did our research - We tried ALL of SR&#039;s Domestic UK DMT.....way prior to deciding to become a vendor ours&quot;elves&quot;.<br /><br />We joined SAFE in the knowledge that NOBODY can touch us on DMT POTENCY.<br /><br />It&#039;s our PURPOSE.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Hiya doubsduces,&nbsp; (and ME!!! Thanks AGAIN!!&nbsp; ;D ;D)<br /><br />My first breakthrough was actually on the changa! and was around 4.30 pm.<br /><br />I then spent around an hour chilling and then helped my buddies blast off.....<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd breakthrough&#039;s were via a bong with a few layers of gauze with just a nice thick layer of cigarette ash to lay the magic power on!!&nbsp; ;D ;D<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd Breakthrough&#039;s were about 40 mins apart nearer the end of our session&nbsp; 8) 8)<br /><br />BEST DAY EVER!! - This stuff should be mandatory for all!! <br />
