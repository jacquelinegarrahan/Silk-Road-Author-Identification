				you should see all transfers and purchases in &quot;account history&quot;, if nothing shows up it&#039;s very strange<br />maybe contact support - when you are in your account, look on the very bottom right of the page<br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t show up because you FEd. Think of it as if you purchased something on a regular net store such as amazon, when your items are delivered the order disappears from the front of the dialog and gets sent to the order history portion because it&#039;s done. By FE you effectively completed the order as if you had the product in your hands, there&#039;s nothing for you to do but pray you were not scammed which believe it or not is a 50/50 chance.
