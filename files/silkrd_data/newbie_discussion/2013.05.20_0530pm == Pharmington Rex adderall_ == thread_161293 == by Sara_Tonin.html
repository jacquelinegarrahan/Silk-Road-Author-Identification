				For real? I was going to come on ask if anyone thought they were a little too strong. Mine came on weds after like 10 days from the UK. Bought 30. Didn&#039;t get a chance to try them out until yesterday. Damn I couldn&#039;t sleep all night. I was so wired up. So I did some things I&#039;ve been putting off. Crossed off everything on my to do list. Then I got about maybe 4 hours of sleep this morning starting at 10am. But I had to take a benzo to help that along. <br /><br />They&#039;re bitter as fuck though. Not going to chew it next time. Just chase it down with a beer or energy drink. Probably better not to chew it so it kicks in a little slower. I feel like I got my ass kicked but ready for another fight. Not your average addy tho. At these prices and being some strong shit...

				I&#039;ve had very prompt communication with Pharmington Rex though, so definitely write to them with their worries. They seem legit, especially considering mojorizen&#039;s response, so I bet we can all get everything worked out.

				Problem with threads like these is that every Tom, Dick And Harry will make a claim thinking they can get a piece of the action. Real or not. And then no one gets anything. Always best to go straight to a vendor first before starting things on the forum. Buyer scammers love these kinds of threads. There&#039;s a graveyard of threads like these with other vendors ... sometimes started by other vendors with shill accounts just to stir up trouble. <br /><br />And there&#039;s threads in the general section that tell us buyers to always go to the vendor first and don&#039;t post on the forum until after resolution or the vendor is AWOL. <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;. If you&#039;re real, you probably shot yourselves in the foot. Don&#039;t expect the vendor to do much especially if you point a thread like this out to them. Going public first and then contacting vendor is a kind of blackmail.

				Huh very good to know mojorizen. We are all newbies here after all... And I&#039;m afraid I have to admit that I did point this thread out to them - wanted PRex to know if there was actually a problem with THEIR supplier. I have been in resolution with them though, asking for an extension before auto-finalization to see if the pills I distributed work for other people. Always the possibility of a bad batch, or my fear is some switcharoo by someone in the whole mailing process, but I reallllly don&#039;t think Prex is a scammer.

				Yeah, they&#039;re definitely not scammers. Scammers try to get you to finalize before shipping and bypass escrow. That&#039;s how they get you.&nbsp; Shame peeps still willingly finalize early. I just don&#039;t get that. Anyway...<br /><br />A vendor like them that allows newbs to use escrow is far from a scammer. There&#039;s so many vendors out there that require low stat buyers to finalize early because low stat buyers often scam vendors. They got a bag of tricks. Like, if no DCN &#039;cause it was shipped first class, they will say they never got it. Or they will say they got less than ordered or got something different than what was ordered. Bunch of other schemes they use. And the most common one is feedback blackmail and threatening to take it to the forums trick. They have to resort to that last one because they rarely ever win in resolutions. Everyone is wise to that game. <br /><br />Plus vendors blacklist them and post them on a private blacklist so they can&#039;t buy from any other vendor. They&#039;ll just get their orders cancelled without notice. There was a scam buyer who made a post complaining that vendors were cancelling his orders. So someone asked what did you do? He ain&#039;t gonna come out of his face and be like, &quot;I blackmailed his ass.&quot; He makes up some sob story about how the vendor did this or that, I can&#039;t remember exactly. But it was obvious that he blackmailed the vendor by threatening a 1/5 and whatever. Got all indignant like the vendor deserved it. He wouldn&#039;t even name the vendor. Wish I remembered that posters name. Went off on a tantrum about being blacklisted and how can this be a free market?... blah blah. <br /><br />Anyway, saying all that to say, be cool. We got our weapons, but sellers got theirs too. So you sometimes have to tread carefully otherwise you end up having to buy only from new vendors who may not know about a blacklist. And new vendors can be hit or miss as they learn the ropes.

Unfortunately, they did not test positive for amphetamine. Pharmington Rex gave me a 33% refund but in my opinion that is less than fair. It may have been just me, but please, if you ordered pills from Rex, can you post results of drug test? If you don&#039;t have a drug testing kit, please just post a picture of the pills you received, and tell us whether or not they had an effect on you.<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ebdy6/pharmington_rex_anyone_tried_that_vendor/<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ebdy6/pharmington_rex_anyone_tried_that_vendor/ca1kx33<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ebdy6/pharmington_rex_anyone_tried_that_vendor/ca6pc11 (I believe this is the same quadrox on silkroad forums)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.msg1147677#msg1147677<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.msg1164841#msg1164841<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157704.msg1138059#msg1138059<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.msg1163798#msg1163798<br /><br />What is also concerning is that I can&#039;t find pictures of an Adderall generic similar to the one Pharmington Rex sent me. The closest I found to it is the 30mg pills manufactured by Shire US which has been discontinued years ago.<br /><br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2668<br /><br />This also is strikingly similar.<br /><br />And even after many messages to Pharmington asking him to send me a picture of the generic adderall pills he sells from a credible third party source, my requests was left unacknowledged and I was accused of being a cop. I can post the full conversation, if you guys are interested.

				I&#039;ve received some PMs from people asking that this vendor be banned for selling fake pills.&nbsp; What I would recommend is using the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on the vendor&#039;s profile if you believe that you&#039;ve received fake pills, and SR admin will look into the issue.

Was this before or after you bought? If after you bought why did you buy if you didn&#039;t know or wasn&#039;t sure of what you were buying? That&#039;s lazy and dumb. If before you bought and you were waiting on this info to make a buying decision but didn&#039;t get it and bought anyway... yeah I don&#039;t know what you call that. <br /><br />Anyway, you got a 33% refund *after* finalizing? Geez man, you&#039;re lucky you got anything at all. Bird in the hand is better than a thousand in flight. The way your post reads, it&#039;s like you think you can get more by pleading your case in public. There&#039;s a reason it&#039;s called finalizing. It&#039;s finito. The end. Done. Time to move on. Game over. <br /><br />And for fuck sake, do *not* post private exchanges on here. You could reveal something about yourself. No wonder you got accused of being a LEO. <br /><br />Smarten up. This isn&#039;t Topix. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: I read your post again trying to figure out your angle and I noticed&nbsp; you&#039;re potentially exposing another poster by cross-referencing them from reddit? Hell&#039;s the matter with you? Reddit is clearnet. Get off the road. Are you really that butthurt that you&#039;re willing to risk the security other people? <br /><br />Something ain&#039;t right with you. I don&#039;t know what it is. Maybe you&#039;re just naive.

				The reddit account is a throwaway, made just for posting SR.<br /><br />And I understand that many people received their shipment no problem and that I finalized.<br /><br />But I finalized only because the drugs arrived, I didn&#039;t know they wouldn&#039;t test positive for amphetamine. Also, the picture you posted of the pills you received is from Shire US, and they have discontinued Adderall IR for years now. Not to mention, it&#039;s not even the same color.<br /><br />This is why I asked PRex to send a picture of generic Adderall pills that he&#039;s selling from a third party source, but there isn&#039;t any of that, because they don&#039;t exist. They&#039;re counterfeit.<br /><br />And I agree, him giving money after finalization was nice, but to think that it&#039;s fair enough and that he doesn&#039;t owe me anything would be dumb. I paid 500$ to buy 100x Adderall IR 30mg pills. Instead, I got 100x pills that don&#039;t even test positive for amphetamines. How is a 33% refund good enough? <br /><br />He didn&#039;t have to do it. I know this. But the fact remains that I got a portion of my money and nothing in return besides very expensive placebo pills.<br /><br />Also not to argue about the price, but atleast if I had paid 2000$ for 100x pills, I would&#039;ve actually had... 100x Adderall pills instead of 100x pills that do nothing.

				I&#039;m with you on this lolnice.<br /><br />Basically you were scammed out of over $300 and apparently you weren&#039;t the only one. If the vendor doesn&#039;t rectify the situation he should be banned. There are enough scammers on here as it is.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get the logic of the people who are saying he did you a favour by only scamming you out of about $300 when he could have scammed you out of the full $500.<br />

Naive, I know, you pointed it out too.<br /><br />Even ghardelli, who defends Pharmington, got pills that were counterfeit.

Who do you think started this thread? <br /><br />You could resort to insults and pointing out how I&#039;m not careful with staying anonymous, and you&#039;d be right. But all my claims and all my arguments could be so so easily refuted with just a picture of the same pills he sells from a credible source. But that&#039;s not going to happen, because they&#039;re counterfeit.

				Pharmington Rex seems legit enough otherwise they&#039;d be gone. From what I remember about the listing picture and description is that it was all there for anyone to google away at. So you didn&#039;t fall for anything. You just didn&#039;t bother to do any homework beforehand as you said. Many vendors use some stock picture grabbed off some website. BUt you can get something completely different. Those people are innocent. You&#039;re just lazy and dumb. Or if what you were saying about all those after you bought questions are true, that sounds like a setup and it&#039;s PHRex that got snookered by you.<br /><br />Anyway... whoever you are (vendor/buyer/both) <br /><br />In your time off, go read about what a real bad vendor is like. You might feel a little dumb afterwards but at least you&#039;ll learn the ropes.

Not to mention that the tracking didn&#039;t even say that the package arrived, so I could&#039;ve just as easily claimed the package never came and not finalize. Oh, and there&#039;s not a single picture of a generic Adderall that matches what he&#039;s selling. And even the guy defending Pharmington Rex says that the pills he got have no effects.<br /><br />At what point exactly did Pharmington get &quot;snookered&quot; by me, when all I got was a 33% refund when I could&#039;ve got a reshipment if I hadn&#039;t trusted the product and didn&#039;t finalize.<br /><br />Anyways, it&#039;s over.

				I currently have had some adderall on order from PRex for a while during their restock.&nbsp; This thread has me a bit concerned that I should cancel but not completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />I already ordered Kpin from Prex that came in and was legit.&nbsp; The quantity was different than what I ordered but they ended up refunding me for pretty much my entire original purchase price taking into account BitCoin appreciation so I got 65 free Kpin pills basically.<br /><br />Prex currently has a 99.9% positive ratings.&nbsp; I saw a single 1/5 on his whole profile and it stated nothing about getting fake pills....<br /><br />So if the people in this thread are telling the truth - where are their bad ratings of them?&nbsp; Why not go back and alter your rating to reflect your true opinion?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see a single rating anywhere on the profile where anyone mentions any possible fake pills at all.<br /><br />ghiradelli - are you able to elaborate any more on your experiences?&nbsp; Sounds like the pills you tried were bunk but you didn&#039;t mention what the people you gave them out to felt?&nbsp; Were they indeed bunk?&nbsp; What was the resolution that left you satisfied?<br /><br />I think these sorts of details are useful for other SR members to understand so we can all determine if Prex is a legit vendor we should all be dealing with.<br /><br />Thanks.

Just converting your &quot;real money&quot; into bit coins runs the risk of the market crashing and you losing everything.<br /><br />lolnice, i know you feel cheated and that feeling sucks but this is not a catastrophe and making it a bigger deal than it is will only cause more problems, not solve the one you have. I&#039;m pretty sure the reason many of us bought 100 or more pills is because the price in bulk was so goddamn good. Like nearly 1/3 what you would have paid buying a single or 5 pills from most of the vendors on SR. Adderall is just goddamn expensive here. So say you paid $600 and it feels like you just lost $400. But if you&#039;d gone to any other vendor you&#039;d have paid $20+ a pill so to get 100 would have cost you $2000.. You could have used that $2000 to buy the same amount and &quot;lost&quot; $400+ a hell of a lot quicker.<br /><br />SR is awesome but it&#039;s not like buying from a pharmacy. No one here HAS to play nice, and giving money after finalization WAS nice. <br /><br />I mean how many times has any of us bought e or acid off a relative stranger and low and behold, it doesn&#039;t work. If you know the dealer well you might bitch to them, but the best you&#039;ll ever get is &quot;sorry bout it.&quot; I certainly have never gotten my money back... And i probably wouldn&#039;t dream of complaining to some dealers because I&#039;d prefer to lose money than start a fight that could end in violence.<br /><br />It seems like you are trying to &quot;prove your case&quot;, or even make PRex prove there&#039;s, but that&#039;s a lost cause. There is no case to prove because there is no judge, no jury, no system. Well, the system is escrow, but we are well past that point.<br /><br />The number of people complaining about these pills having no effect is far far lower than the number who have happily dealt with Pharmington Rex. At this point, if I were you, I&#039;d thank them for the 33%, apologize for causing any hassle, maintain that unfortunately the pills that reached you were not adderall, and ask for a discount on your next purchase when they get a restock... if they&#039;ll sell to you a little cheaper than the average buyer, or even sell you 33 pills at the price they usually reserve for bulk shipments, you are going to walk away a winner.<br /><br />I just really cannot fathom anything you could do that would inspire them to refund you 100% of the money you paid, despite the fact you received a shipment, finalized, and MOST people who received the same shipment had no problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />apologize for causing any hassle? lmao seriously? if i bought 100 pills and they were bunk i would be pissed. i dont care what the price is. if someone is selling 100 30mg adderall for $5 then i expect to get what i pay for. i have bought 100+ pills at a time in the past and i&#039;m not going to test every single one before i finalize. i dont see the problem in saying something if you got a crap product. lots of people have said they didnt feel anything off them and scout said in this thread about people messaging to have the vendor banned. where theres smoke theres fire. dont let vendors get away with selling shit product.

Sharks come out. It&#039;s an anonymous message board and an anonymous market. No one&#039;s got anything to fear or lose since no one knows who is who. So you can never really get at the truth since you can&#039;t prove anything. That&#039;s why we get so many conspiracy theories when something happens on SR. &quot;DPR ran off with our money!!11!!&quot; and shit like that. <br /><br />There was a Marquis test that proved amphetamine in one of the reviews. But who made the review, right? Just as who started this thread? Could it be an actual buyer or is it a vendor losing sales who started it? Could there be a violation of price fixing agreements among Adderall sellers and now Ph Rex has to pay the price since they didn&#039;t go along? That&#039;s happened before with perc and coke sellers. <br /><br />Anyways my point was... take any thread about a vendor&#039;s product where someone claims it&#039;s cut up or it might be something other than, then it turns into a feeding frenzy with peeps coming out the woodwork to try to get something out of the vendor. And then you get people who just like to shit disturb. Seen it with RCs, LSD, coke, heroin, and meth. Vendors accused defend themselves in vain. They can&#039;t prove otherwise to anyone&#039;s satisfaction. How could they? No one can even prove who the actual buyers are. And when the so called buyers show up to defend, if they aren&#039;t regular posters with high post counts, they won&#039;t be believed while accussers with low post count are believed. Crazy right?<br /><br />Could some people have actually received bad pills? I don&#039;t know maybe. Is it intentional like a selective scam? That would be a dumbass move that no vendor would attempt. That kind of scam just don&#039;t work. You have to get people to FE for selective scams to work and be worthwhile. It&#039;s all about the FE. FE is all about the hit and run. I don&#039;t think Ph Rex even does FE. At least I&#039;ve never seen one of those &quot;FE&#039;d will update when received&quot; or &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot; type feedbacks. So what&#039;s the point of attempting to scam people in escrow? It&#039;s the other way around. The buyers try to scam vendors when in escrow. <br /><br />So you know, think about things awhile. Half the shit on this forum ain&#039;t true, the other half you can&#039;t prove. It&#039;s all about likelihoods and risk taking. Just like on the streets. It&#039;s drug dealing. We&#039;re all outlaws. <br /><br /><br />

				maybe he bought a ton of pills and all/some of them turned out to be shit and instead of taking a loss he just continued to sell them<br />or he didnt even know they were shit. maybe they were mixed in to good ones<br />just sounds sketchy to me. he doesnt even have that many sales. i think its under 150 and numerous people have said they didnt catch a buzz on the same pills. <br />i dont even think they have the adderall listings up anymore<br />i question why they were being sold for so cheap<br />

Know what I&#039;m saying?<br /><br />And the price wasn&#039;t cheap unless you bought a lot. All the other adderall sellers sell for like $20/pill but only sell singles or a 5 or 10 bag. That&#039;s a total ripoff since you can get them local for $5 to $10 a pill. Mayeb not now since finals were on and demand was up. So when you think of it Ph Rex prices were close to street prices but they didn&#039;t sell singles or like a 5 or 10 bag. Min was 20 or 30 bag. <br /><br />It&#039;s just like perc/oxy/hydro pill sellers. Mugs who sell singles do so at up to $2/mg. Then as you buy bulk, it can get as low as $.70/mg. Check it out. Look at Googleyed and PureOs prices. Then look at someone like Vicodin or anyone selling singles or 5 pill bags. You&#039;ll see what I mean. Volume discount. So price ain&#039;t a guide for quality unless you&#039;re comparing quantity/price.

				I can actually say that this experience has recently happened to me too. I bought 30x 30mg and it arrived approx 10days after purchase.

I&#039;ve taken all the different types of adderall out there and I knew these weren&#039;t the right color nor the right size. A bit bulkier than usual, not to mention the taste was excessively bitter (moreso than the usual as well). At that point, I knew they were fake.

				Regarding the Ranbaxy (or as I understand through some more reading CorePharma), these pills are still being sold.&nbsp; I am not sure what/where Shire came from in this conversation???&nbsp; I know they manufactured adderall but they aren&#039;t mentioned anywhere on Prex&#039;s page or anywhere else.<br /><br />I do see MANY people online claiming that they felt different effects from Ranbaxy than from Barr (when buying directly from pharmacies) so maybe this has something to do with the SR users reactions to the pills.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would say about 75% of the people I have read swear by Barr and think Ranbaxy (CorePharma) is shit but then there are about 25% who seem to say that Ranbaxy worked better for them.&nbsp; Seems the inactive ingredients are different and some claims that these differences affect absorption into the body.<br /><br />Dunno what to think anymore.&nbsp; I cancelled my order with PRex as I determine what to do....<br /><br />order ~ 25 pills of orange from another vendor or 100 pink/purple from Prex?

				i understand there can be multiple posts by the same person. in this case i dont think so. in this thread alone there is a few people who have said they didnt get off on them and they all seem to have past history on the forums. i&#039;m not talking about the 1 post wonders, i dont even count them. personally, i wasnt told on the forums. it was by some people i trust who do adderall regularly.<br />i got the information about the price in this thread. a post said the reason they suspected them and others purchased was because the price was so cheap. it was just a theory on why maybe people were having bad experiences. it wouldnt be the first time a dealer picked up crap and tried to unload it for cheaper prices. drugs dont always have the best return policies lol<br /><br />anyways i didnt even really want to get into whether or not the vendors product is legit. i didnt buy it or take it. i just wanted to respond to that one poster who was telling another member to just lie down and take in the ass if you get crap product. i didnt agree with that post and i dont think it was good advice to give. even if its just one person who didnt like there product, they have a right to express it as long as it fair and realisitic. if we use the attitude that we have to be prepared to get ripped off by vendors once in a while there will be vendors who exploit that. they need to be held accountable for every transaction.

				Overzealous? LOL. Take a step back and think about it. Jack N hoff&#039;s been around for a while, so he knows what I&#039;m talking about when these kinds of things come up with vendors. You get all kinds of stories that don&#039;t add up, can&#039;t be backed up, some just plain fucked up. <br /><br />And look, you get some saying white pills, some pink, some purple? It&#039;s all over the place. <br /><br />A poster or two might be telling the truth. The rest probably ain&#039;t. That&#039;s just how these things go. It&#039;s a &quot;shock&quot; to some people that buyers scam or try to scam vendors more often than vendors try to scam buyers. Sell some hard drugs and you&#039;ll learn that quick. Junkies will do all kinds of things to try to get one over. Go look at some herion and coke vendor reviews. In the end it&#039;s probably just their tolerance from abuse that&#039;s making them think the vendor is cutting up the drugs more than when they first started buying. <br /><br />Buyers scam because they feel safe. You can&#039;t see their feedback since there isn&#039;t one. The smart buyers who scam finalize first so that when they blackmail the vendor and get a refund (partial/full), it won&#039;t show up on their stats. Refunds only show up when you get them in resolutions. <br /><br />I&#039;m not overzealous. Just cluing y&#039;all in on what really goes down on here. This ain&#039;t a pharmacy. Some of these mugs selling shit are hardcore thugs that IRL you wouldn&#039;t fuck with. Where do you think a lot of these vendors get their wares from? If it were so easy, you wouldn&#039;t be here. You&#039;d hook yourself up for less.<br /><br />Yeah anyway, I bought from them twice and mine were fine. So were a lot of other people apparently. But you&#039;re not going to see happy customers praising anywhere near as many unhappy customers knocking a vendor on the forums. Why take the time out if you&#039;re happy? Just look around the rumor mill and the so and so is a scammer or so and so&#039;s product is weak threads. (A lot of that crap is vendor on vendor competition with competing vendors posing as buyers). Plus most people don&#039;t even use the forums. That&#039;s a fact you can figure out yourself. For many, their first time using the forum is when something goes wrong or they FE&#039;d and got taken. <br /><br />You can check my post history and see I raged on a vendor or two. But I stopped that shit. It&#039;s pointless. So I flipped the script once I woke up.

				Because of catch-22. You could get blacklisted. Feedback blackmail is #1 buyer scam - real or not. Changing your feedback rating later or just leaving a 1/5 can get you on the vendors blacklist whether you did it to try to scam a vendor or if you&#039;re just pissed off at them cause of whatever. It only works if everybody is doing it because the vendor is a bonafide scammer or flaked out on everybody. Not to name names so go look at vendors with low ratings and you&#039;ll see what I mean.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ain&#039;t SR grand? Every time you buy on here you take a chance.

				So when you add it all up it&#039;s not intentional (for obvious reasons), not &quot;fishy&quot;, just plain old accidental. Robloblaw&#039;s theory is probably closest to the truth about getting a whole mess of them. When you think about it, they&#039;re in the US (according to their profile) but they got some op going on in the UK because that&#039;s what the listing said they would be from and that&#039;s where they shipped from. With peeps describing 4 different colors/kind and then they sold in quantities which would have to be from bulk supply or from different suppliers, it seems like they wouldn&#039;t have known. <br /><br />The first time I got from them, it was from the US. That was 2 months ago or something. I was one of the lucky ones because soon after they ran out of US and shipped from UK. Not a peep about some fakes that go round.<br /><br />So I rolled the dice and ordered this time knowing it was coming from UK. Took a while to get here. But mine are all good as I&#039;m sure many other peep&#039;s was. <br /><br />But there&#039;s always an element of some conspiracy in play. Anonymous forum and all, it&#039;s inescapable. I bet there&#039;s some feedback blackmail going on behind the scenes. There&#039;s always that. Most vendors go through it at least once. Is every poster claim valid? Some are probably real claims, some are not. It&#039;s always like that. Nature of the game. Some vendors go ape shit over it. But really, they should take it in stride. It&#039;s the cost of doing business on here. Just like we as buyers have to roll with the punches every now and again. Especially with thinks like RC, coke, H and meth. Basically anything someone cuts or cooks up. Shit varies with each batch. Some vendors have consistent quality tho, more or less.<br /><br />LOL @ Jack n Hoff. I love that term &quot;fishy.&quot;&nbsp; My pops used to say that for just about everything. Was always looking for the boogeyman around the corner. Took nothing at face value. I guess I got some of that. Always feel like I&#039;m rolling the dice no matter what. <br /><br />@ Ghiradelli, check your PM. I got some advice for ya. ;)

It&#039;s just a forum full of nobodies. Worry about what a vendor thinks about you changing feedback on them at this late stage in the game. You&#039;re already sketchy bro. You&#039;re only making yourself seem more sketchy. That alone could get you blacklisted and let me tell you being blacklisted sucks cause you won&#039;t know until it&#039;s too late. <br /><br />And if your forum name is the same as your SR name, dang kid. all other vendors have to do is search the forum and find your few posts and I can&#039;t think of any vendor who&#039;d want to do business with someone who is so careless about their personal security. It&#039;s just like if a vendor was careless with security, who&#039;d want to buy from them? <br /><br />So whatever you did with your feedback rating, put it back to whatever it was. The comment can say anything but don&#039;t reveal personal info of any kind. You don&#039;t need to prove jack to forumites. <br /><br />I was going to say stop making newb mistakes. But you&#039;re going self-destructive over a bad deal. Don&#039;t do it. You don&#039;t know who vendors are in league with or what they say to each other. Be cool bro. Be cool. <br /><br />If you want to see how bad things can get with a vendor when you leave bad feedback and make a point of it, see the thread in the discussion section about a buyer getting death threats from a vendor. You gotta take your security seriously on here. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=167421.0<br /><br />Lots of this stuff. Sicking the cops on buyers, threatening controlled deliveries, all kinds of sick crap.

				Nope. Just saying to think about it before doing it. Especially changing feedback. <br /><br />Hey you can ignore me. Instead read around the forum and you&#039;ll get a better understanding. In fact, read some feedback. Click around.<br /><br />Ever see ones like this...<br /><br />&quot;5/5 - product never arrived.&quot; <br />&quot;5/5 - was underweight&quot;<br />&quot;5/5 - took 4 weeks to arrive.&quot; <br />&quot;5/5 - buds crushed and sparkly things on it.&quot;<br /><br />Why do you think people leave this kind of feedback? Cause some of them read the consequences of leaving bad feedback with some vendors. Burn a bridge with one, you can burn a bridge with many. You just don&#039;t know which you&#039;re also burning a bridge with. That&#039;s the shitty minefield part of it all. Most vendors have an &quot;Us v Them&quot; mentality. A lot of it is because a high percentage of buyers are kind of dumb or naive. <br /><br />So you gotta break the eBay mentality. Plus SR has to fix or change the feedback system. If a 4/5 wasn&#039;t almost as damaging as a 1/5, vendors wouldn&#039;t make such a big deal about it. Talk to vendors and ask them how they feel about anything less than a 5/5 or people who change their feedback. You&#039;re going to get some very interesting responses. Ask about what kind of buyer gets on the blacklist.&nbsp; Ask them why so many vendors want newbs to FE. <br /><br />I&#039;m giving you the real deal. The newbie section is like a circle jerk of naivete and many don&#039;t bother to venture out and read the other sections to learn a thing or three.&nbsp; Hey, most SR buyers don&#039;t even read the forums to begin with. There would be a lot less FE&#039;ing if they did.

				&quot;changing feedback rating number now isn&#039;t a smart thing. A 1/5 is as if we gave you nothing. Things like that we&#039;re sort of obligated to let other vendors know about.&quot;<br /><br />I think this might be how british gentlemen speak for &quot;you&#039;ve been blacklisted&quot;.<br /><br />Edit: Uhmm..

				Let me preface this by saying that I normally do not post on forums and the fact that this is my only post should not discredit me. I feel strongly enough that Pharmington Rex is selling fake Adderall so I going out of my way to make this post. Whether or not the vendor knows the pills are fake is up for debate, and whether or not other products sold by this vendor are fake I cannot attest to.<br /><br />My background:<br />I consider myself an &quot;experienced&quot; Adderall user and have been using it for years. I know what the effects feel like, and at different dosages, as well as the side effects. I typically source Adderall from various friends which are perscribed to the drug. I have seen many different generic Adderall pills in both instant and extended (XR) form. I know how it compares to Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine).<br /><br />Here is a picture I took of the pills from Pharmington Rex next to legitimate Adderall:<br />http://postimg.org/image/t8yk096ev/<br /><br />I decided to purchase from Pharmington Rex because of the quantity available and value in comparison to other vendors on the road as well as the almost stellar reputation of the vendor. The US stock was depleted and my order had been pending for a while, I was offered shipping from the UK or to wait for an uncertain amount of time so I opted for international shipping. I purchased 50 pills.<br /><br />Pharmington Rex claims to sell &quot;Generic Ranbaxy amphetamine-dextroamphetamine 30mg IR (Adderall IR)&quot; - copied from their vendor page.<br /><br />The pills I received (see above for picture) was an off-white, not quite orange, round pill with the imprint AD 30. According to drugs.com pill identifier, the AD 30 imprint is from the manufacturer &quot;Shire US&quot; and the images linked below depict a much darker orange than the pills I received.<br />http://www.drugs.com/imprints/ad-30-1123.html<br />https://d4fuqqd5l3dbz.cloudfront.net/products/DrugItem_8307.JPG (source: http://www.goodrx.com/adderall/identification)<br /><br />I am unable to find any images of Ranbaxy brand Adderall, though my search was not thorough. It did not take me longer than a minute or two to find images of the other brands. Regardless, I don&#039;t think it matters much.<br /><br />Here are informational links to the other generic pills in my picture:<br />http://www.drugs.com/imprints/cor-135-12835.html<br />http://www.drugs.com/imprints/e-404-11166.html<br /><br />You can use those images to compare against my picture, and you will see that the Pharmington Rex AD 30 pills do not look authentic.<br /><br /><br />Subjective analysis:<br />Myself and a few friends have tried the Adderall from PRex without any effects. One try, I took two and a half which should be ~75mg and that would be a considerable amount if it were real. I experienced no stimulant effect, no dry-mouth, and my appetite was normal. Same for my friends.<br /><br />I attempted to get objective results by trying a Marquis reagent test for the PRex Adderall and against the pink Cor Adderall but the results were inconclusive as the test does not explicitly test for dex-amphetamine and the ratio of binders and fillers in each pill to actual dex-amphetamine. That is the only reagent test I have available.<br /><br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The pills I received are fake. Though I am not claiming that everything Pharmington Rex sends is fake. BUYER BEWARE.<br /><br /><br />I do not intend to take this up with the vendor for two reasons: I don&#039;t think anything will be resolved (return of bitcoins or replacement with real Adderall) and they also have my name and address.

				Thanks for your posting buyer_beware.&nbsp; I already cancelled my Adderall order from PRex based on other comments but it is disturbing to see the trend continuing.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t really think the vendor knows that the pills are fake and they seem to be trying to make good with everyone who sincerely complains to them.&nbsp; They should just stop selling the shit until they figure out what is going on, but so far it seems at least like everyone who complains on the forums eventually says that they have worked something out that they are satisfied with - except for the one user who only got a 33% refund.<br /><br />I ordered some Klonopin off of Prex a while back and it was clear from the communication process that it is a large organization of people with not everyone in direct communication which could easily lead to mixups.&nbsp; The klonopin was top notch and at a great price.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t touch their adderall with a ten foot pole however.&nbsp; BTW, Ranbaxy adderall is an actual brand.&nbsp; Ranbaxy markets the products that CorePharma produces.&nbsp; I spent a long time the other night doing research on this.&nbsp; These are the pills withe the COR stamps.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the pills in PRex&#039;s pictuers and in yours do NOT have a COR stamp so WTF?&nbsp; In the end I found so many reports online of people being unhappy with Ranbaxy/CorePharma purchased from actual pharmacies that I determined even if this stuff IS legit I&#039;d rather pay more and get some Barr instead.&nbsp; Also there are plenty of reports of Ranbaxy in general being shady and the FDA investigating them.

Obviously others didn&#039;t get fake pills (like me, twice, as I claim. Dontcha just love people claiming things?). <br /><br />Anyway, you were kind of doing OK. I like the pic you took with all those different Adderalls lined up. Nice shot with your shadow outline in the pic as you hovered over while taking it. Gives it that 70&#039;s &quot;spy&quot; shady vibe with you holding one of those mini secret cameras hiding in a pack of cigs. You even have an XR capsule in there. Where&#039;d you get all those from? Personal stash? See my man, if you say you&#039;re an expert or experienced (which I&#039;m not all that much) and you know your adderalls, why would you buy them in the first place? Yeah, I get what you&#039;re saying about bang for buck prices. I bought for the same reason. Everyone else sells at jacked up cartel prices. And yup, their rep was good and I liked their &quot;olde skool&quot; schtick. But I bought to flip them and keep some for myself for those days I gotta kick sleep to the curb to get shit done. But see to me, right, someone who is...{an &quot;experienced&quot; Adderall user and have been using it for years...} and {...seen many different generic Adderall pills in both instant and extended (XR) form...} would have done all this research ahead of time since you never seen that kind before.&nbsp; Hey I don&#039;t know, maybe you did do the research ahead of time but said, &quot;ah fuck it. Price is right.&quot; <br /><br />See what I mean? It&#039;s like that other player, lolnice. He researched after the purchase. But in his case, he says he did so while order was in transit. In transit? Whaaa? I don&#039;t know about this guy. But I think he might been a newb not knowing what he was doing. <br /><br />But yours reads like a setup to me. Like a rival vendor trying to discredit their competition that&#039;s underselling the market. But that&#039;s just speculation on my part. I&#039;m just adding things up and reading what people post. I&#039;ve seen this before with other vendors getting cut up by what looks like buyers but turned out to be the competition. There was a perc/oxy seller early this year who went through something like this and the rival vendor posted their competition&#039;s goodbye blowup message on their profile page like a trophy cause their campaign worked. <br /><br />Yeah so here&#039;s where you really discredit yourself: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I do not intend to take this up with the vendor for two reasons: I don&#039;t think anything will be resolved (return of bitcoins or replacement with real Adderall) and they also have my name and address.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That doesn&#039;t make sense. Why not try? It even says on their profile to contact them. You can see come people claim to have got something from them to make up for it. Scammers don&#039;t do that. Scammers&nbsp; ignore people. I mean, even lolnice claims to have gotten something and says he was offered even more later. <br /><br />Second major mistake you made that outs you as someone trying to shit disturb and get a vendor banned is that you claim that they have your name and address. That&#039;s a cardinal sin for vendors to keep that info. Sure some probably do for some period of time. That&#039;s been proven. So we can&#039;t be naive about that. But here you&#039;re claiming it as a *fact*. That&#039;s enough to get a vendor banned immediately if proven true. But if you never contacted them about trying to resolve it, how on earth can you claim they have your address still? <br /><br />Here&#039;s how I would know if a vendor still had my address...<br /><br />Me to vendor: hey brother. I got the pack today. But damn yo. You shorted me like 30 pills on a 180 pill order. I counted twice and sho&#039; nuff. I&#039;m 30 short. What&#039;s up? A few broken ones too. I can&#039;t sell those bro. Hate to say it but I can&#039;t finalize until you make this right. Know what I mean?<br />&nbsp;<br />Vendor to me: shit man, sorry about that. I&#039;ll send you out 40 via Priority mail. Is that cool? I&#039;ll get it out in today&#039;s mail. You should have it in 2 days, 3 max.<br /><br />Now, how the hell did he know where to send it? He didn&#039;t ask. Proof positive that the vendor saved my address after shipping. And this kind of thing has happened to buyers with some vendors in the past. And those vendors got suspended or banned for it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />So yeah, I&#039;m skeptical of your particular claim. (Some people are probably telling the truth tho.) But your cool story bro, it&#039;s got all the elements of a setup with all the plot holes of one not too well thought out. Sorry for analyzing your post like that. But newbs on here will believe anything. Someone&#039;s got to show them the ropes. How to sniff out what doesn&#039;t add up. It&#039;s the best one can do on here. You can&#039;t get to the truth of nothing on here since it&#039;s all anonymous and what not. Best you can do is figure out what&#039;s written between the lines, what&#039;s missing, and what doesn&#039;t add up?<br /><br />*shrug*<br /><br />Yeah, it&#039;s frustrating sometimes trying to figure things out. I noticed Hoobydoobydoo was running round the forum trying to get some better info. It sucks that all he or she got was a bunch of stories that seemed real enough or some advice to think about other possibilities. When you add up all those elements you&#039;re left with making a decision based on your tolerance for risk taking. Nobody likes a &quot;maybe it is.&quot; We want a solid yep or nope. Man, try buying some dope or ice on here. Opinions on both sides of any vendor of those things are so far apart sometimes you just gotta throw your hands up in the air and either say, &quot;fuck it&quot; or &quot;fuck that.&quot; <br /><br />Welcome of SR. Land of the free. Home of the brave. <br />

I ordered, got fake pills and naively finalized before I tried them. Just because I made a mistake, and I&#039;m an idiot for it, doesn&#039;t mean that Pharmington Rex is a legitimate Adderall vendor.<br /><br />Edit: Just to make it clear, when I say legitimate I don&#039;t mean legal.

				@ lolnice<br /><br />Mojo&#039;s been around for a while. The vendor who he was referring to was OneStop and his rival SouthStar. They both sold Percocet pills. There was definitely vendor on vendor scamming and defaming going on during that time and it broke OneStop. There&#039;s a thread or two about it. OneStop had the cheapest pills for a while. I did some business with him and was always satisfied. I was surprised by his blow up. I haven&#039;t bought percs off SR since. <br /><br />I can see how you might think mojo is affiliated with Pharmington Rex but Pharmington Rex is a &quot;them&quot; not a &quot;he.&quot; If you&#039;ve been around for a while, you&#039;d know that it wouldn&#039;t make sense for Mojo to be affiliated with them of all people. You can read his post history by clicking on his profile. His speculations here have some merit you have to admit. There&#039;s a lot of questions and things that make you go hmmmm. But as a long time SR member, I can tell you that things aren&#039;t always what they seem on here. The forum has changed somewhat since it first started. New crop of buyers seem to have the wrong idea about this place. Us old timers are cynical and suspicious of everyone because we&#039;re seen just about every kind of drama that&#039;s happened. <br /><br />As for Pharmington Rex, I also bought Adderall and got Kpin samples from them and they were all fine. Pretty much as described taste wise and looked like their picture from what I recall. Though mine looked nothing like what is pictured in buyer_beware&#039;s post. Those look spotty orangish. Mine were pink. There might have been more than one type shipped out. Maybe it&#039;s the fault of their shipper. They are supposed to be located in the US but the current round of Adderalls was shipped from the UK. Who knows how they&#039;re set up. <br /><br />And yes, buyer_beware&#039;s post does sort of read like a vendor made it. But whatever. Someone might say minde does too. <br /><br />Lolnice, dont worry, your posts don&#039;t read like a vendor made them. Hard to figure out the time line of events in your experience. Was this your first ever buy on SR? You did the right thing by finalizing on receiving. But if I&#039;ve read this whole thing right, you had a test kit on hand but didn&#039;t test before finalizing? Doesn&#039;t matter. Who actually tests pills before finalizing anyway? Testing is for &quot;home made&quot; product, like molly and tar. So don&#039;t feel bad. But if you had questions before the package arrived and you had a test kit on hand but didn&#039;t test before finalizing then that&#039;s pretty bad. Look on the bright side. You got something. That&#039;s way more than most when things go tits up. And that&#039;s whether you&#039;re in resolutions or after you finalized. <br /><br />BTW, Ranbaxy makes drugs for different world markets. Many drug companies do. And they look different for different markets and often have different names and imprints. Corepharma and Shire is US only. They subcontract for Ranbaxy for some products. If anyone has ever traveled around the world for more than a week and had to get a script filled for any kind of pill, you&#039;d know that what you get at home is almost never what you get aboard. Pill ID sites seem to only specialize in American made and distributed pills. So I wouldn&#039;t go by that as a hard and fast guide. Klonopins or whatever the chemical name is for that benzo, has a few names and pill designs made by the same companies depending on where in the world they are sold. Forget about alprazolam. There&#039;s at least 100 names and pill types around the world. <br /><br />The admins are &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; because so so so many people complain about almost every vendor&#039;s product quality almost everyday for a whole bunch of reasons. Think about it from an admin&#039;s point of view. What would you do if you got these complaints from a minority of customers many of whom only come out of the wood work once there&#039;s a forum or chat post or complain because they didn&#039;t get the high they thought they&#039;d get? <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.msg1210749#msg1210749">Quote from: hoobydoobydoo on June 07, 2013, 06:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is precisely what I was referring to earlier in the thread when I said mojorizen seemed a bit overzealous.&nbsp; It just seems a bit much for someone who isn&#039;t personally invested.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s nothing. That&#039;s kind of normal for vendor fans. Reading his posts, he&#039;s actually pointing out some important things that newbs need to learn. I gave up trying to teach newbs the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts of SR. There&#039;s more FE now than ever it seems. So I figure FE losses are club dues. <br /><br />And he also bought from them and didn&#039;t have the same experience. Isn&#039;t that what you were asking for? Now you got two. <br /><br />Like any forum when it comes to products, people will post about problems more than people without.

I offered to give Pharmington Rex anything he asked for, anything, that would make him believe me because like you, I believed he may have not known about these pills. I didn&#039;t even care if I stayed anonymous to him and I told him that. He said I&#039;m probably law enforcement and just kept talking about how buyer scamming is too common and nobody believes buyers ever.<br /><br />And about how the pills look, you could be right. I won&#039;t mention that part anymore.<br /><br />But the point is still the same, I got pills that didn&#039;t contain Amphetamines and were sold as Adderall, and I didn&#039;t want placebo to play any part in it so I tested it and now my wallet is 300$ thinner even after Pharmington&#039;s generosity in giving me a 33% refund.

I was a part of that discussion which took place around January of this year. Mojo was taking jabs at SouthStar and pretty much exposed him as a vendor using a buyer account to discredit OneStop. Allegedly, there was also some interference being run on OneStop&#039;s international orders by SouthStar. IIRC, not a single one of OneStop&#039;s international packages made it through customs. I also had an order that never made it but I never got a love letter from Customs. About 5 weeks after I placed the international order, while it was still in transit &quot;limbo&quot;, OneStop did a reship and sent me my order from his domestic supply free of charge and told me I could keep the international one if it ever arrived. During that time, about 3 weeks after I placed my international order, OneStop also overnighted me about 20 - 25 pills.&nbsp; I forget exactly how many. But it was my first and only time I ever finalized early for an order. I was the first to order from his then new international offerings. I had a good relationship with OneStop. We&#039;d chat about a lot of things. Had some funny conversations about behind the scenes SR drama. He was a stand up guy where I was concerned. But if we weren&#039;t on such good terms, I would have lost out big time like everyone else who finalized early for the international order. I felt really bad about everyone who lost money with him. HE was a really good vendor and I would recommend him because of his great stealth, fast shipping (domestic) and fair prices. Plus he had the lowest opiate prices on SR. <br /><br />But OneStop also went through a claim of bad pills. Someone said they got sick from his pills (Mallinkrodt 512 percocet). It was a hoax but that was the alleged beginning of Southstar&#039;s campaign against OneStop.&nbsp; But there&#039;s no real way to prove it was SouthStar behind any of it. And when OneStar had a public melt down about the situation where he called his clients &quot;junkies&quot; (but excluded me), SouthStar posted the entirety of OneStop&#039;s farewell blow up post onto their seller profile and sported it like a winner&#039;s trophy for more than a month. <br /><br />SouthStar is still a vendor on SR, but his sales are really low in spite of his super low prices. <br /><br />That&#039;s the back-story on that deal. At least as much as I can remember without having to dig up the threads for a refresher. I think Mojo is seeing some similarities between what&#039;s going on with P. Rex and those claiming to have received bunk Adderalls. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s entirely possible that some people received bunk Adderalls. It&#039;s just hard to prove. Reading over your posts and your explanation above, you seem genuine enough. But you potentially put yourself at risk. And to be honest, I&#039;m glad you couldn&#039;t go that far to prove yourself.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t trust P. Rex., per se. But you never know who any vendor is on here and who they work with. And since they seem to be a group, you might have exposed yourself to many people you&#039;re not even aware that exist. P.Rex doesn&#039;t seem like the type that&#039;s going to go send some hitmen after you or some nonsense like that. But since you don&#039;t know the extent of their operation, someone from there could have blackmailed to you give them money or else they would report you to the &quot;authorities.&quot; There was a Meth Vendor that threatened a few buyers like that. VortexMilkman. Colorful character. When you have time, do a search on that guy. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you got something instead of nothing. 33% is not the best but at least it&#039;s something. Something is always better than nothing. But everything is better than something and nothing. :) <br /><br />Why didn&#039;t you take them up on their free 20 pill offer? Was it not really free in the sense that they asked you to pay shipping or some other fee? If it&#039;s totally free, I say go for it. They wouldn&#039;t send you bunk pills a second time. And if they did, what have you got to lose? But even if you didn&#039;t want the pills to use personally, after you test a piece of one, you could sell them to people you trust and recoup some more money that way. Addy street prices range from $10 to maybe $15 each. So that&#039;s about $200-$300 in your pocket.&nbsp; Even if you could only sell them for $8 or $9 each you&#039;re still getting something more. If their offer is still on the table, definitely consider taking it. That might be a first for any vendor to do as far as I can remember. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about them getting your address again and doing something stupid against you, Don&#039;t. But the easy way around having to worry about it is to change your feedback score to 5/5 from wherever it is now so they&#039;ll have nothing to really hold against you. Seriously, if they are offering some more compensation after they gave you a refund after you finalized, it means they&#039;re not holding a grudge or anything and they might be believing you. Unless there&#039;s more to it than you&#039;re telling us, like you&#039;re blackmailing them and that&#039;s why they are offering more. But you don&#039;t seem the type to me.&nbsp; Plus a vendor can counter a blackmail attempt with a blackmail threat of their own. Also remember, you can always update your feedback it if they send you bunk meds again. But I can&#039;t see them or any vendor doing that. What would be the point? That would only make things worse.<br /><br />Some vendors overly fixate on their feedback score. Sometimes they don&#039;t realize that buyers will buy from a vendor as long as feedback is 80 or above, the price is a little better than everyone else&#039;s and current feedback left by buyers shows consecutive 5/5&#039;s and relatively good things to say for 1 or 2 pages.&nbsp; I personally would give and haven given vendors a shot if their score is below 90 and they are looking to bring their score up. You can get some of the best deals and best service during those times. I got free overnight shipping one time with some extra goodies inside. <br /><br />My advice to you is to get what you can from this place, as often as you can. Practice safe sex... erm... I mean safe security and some common sense so you don&#039;t end up behind bars. And stay off the vendor blacklists. Not every vendor uses it. But if they have a forum presence and a SR vendor tag under their name, they probably do. But new vendors don&#039;t follow any blacklists because they have no access to any.

				First, let me start by saying:Again, thanks for your unbiased, direct and un-condescending reply that shows you took the time to read my posts and even gave me the benefit of the doubt to hink I&#039;m not the type to threaten black mail and stuff like that. Very appreciated.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.msg1212616#msg1212616">Quote from: BenJesuit on June 08, 2013, 01:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">TL;DR: Take P Rex up on offer to get 20 free pills.

I&#039;m not very interested in making my money back anymore, it&#039;s alright, I can handle a 300$ loss.<br /><br />What I can&#039;t handle is taking another chance with address again, so I&#039;m going to skip on that 20 pill offer, atleast for now. If later they prove to be trustworthy and people reporting actual legit Adderall, I will try contacting them again to see if the offer is still on the table, and I will come and give my honest feedback.<br /><br />The link they provided me is still valid, but I&#039;d rather let this one pass.<br /><br />I know I can&#039;t prove anything here, and this is a complete lost cause, but I know atleast 3 that backed out of buying from PRex. And I know it almost seems vindictive to think that this is an accomplishment and has similarities to SouthStar posting the farewell, but if their purchase would&#039;ve been similar to mine, I&#039;d say I did a good thing here.<br /><br />Pharmington Rex may not have sent me those pills intentionally(and his feedback seems decent, even though other people also reported not feeling effects), and if so, I most sincerely apologize for driving customers away. It&#039;s just that I finalized even though tracking showed that my package didn&#039;t arrive, which is grounds for atleast some refund. Also I already had doubts because of how the pills look, but I chose to ignore them and trust Pharmington Rex and his stellar reputation, and my trust was valued at 33% refund after days of arguing. Other customers that complained before they finalized got a full reshipment. I just felt cheated by him and all those that gave incredible ratings on a vendor that sold me counterfeit pills for 300$.<br /><br />And although I can&#039;t prove this, but mojorizen does seem to have a personal agenda here especially after re-reading his first post in this thread. <br /><br />But this is irrelevant.<br /><br />I will extend Pharmington the same benefit of the doubt you extended me, and assume that this was not his intentional and avoid driving any more customers away from him. I will keep my feedback as it is, however, I think it&#039;s only fair to give my honest opinion of the transaction.<br /><br />Edit: Noticed some spelling mistakes and what not, but too lazy to fix, maybe tomorrow when I&#039;m not so tired. Apologies.

				Bro, don&#039;t worry about spelling mistakes. As long as it close enough. <br /><br />I read mojo&#039;s first post again and the thing is, he&#039;s right about the effects when you get the good ones. But everybody&#039;s biochemistry is a little different so there will be some variations in effect. I&#039;m an occasional stim user. I&#039;ve only had a few kinds of adderalls like Teva and Greenstone plus these. Then dexedrine which is kind of like adderall, coke, meth, and speed. Low does meth (10mg-20mg) crushed up with a roxi crushed up and parachuted or mixed in a shot is a sweet rush and come down. Taken just before you eat a meal and pow! <br /><br />Look at me getting all off track day dreaming about rushing explosively euphoric highs. Those were the days. <br /><br />What was I going to say now? Oh yeah, no mojo&#039;s agenda isn&#039;t personal really. That&#039;s how he rolls sometimes. A lot of us veterans try to school the new guys that come on SR. I used to do it a lot before there was a section for new guys. But it&#039;s like once you get caught up in a conversation it can be hard to back out since you invested time in it. He&#039;s right about a lot of things. It&#039;s just the delivery is &quot;all up in your grill&quot; style. If you can see through all that, then you&#039;ll see what&#039;s being said is good advice and pretty good observations. Not that I need to tell you since you already pointed that out.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It&#039;s like this. In any kind of thread like this, you have a few types of people. The alleged victims, the defenders, the advisers, the critics who have no skin in the game, the pot stirrers who get off on the drama, the objective observers, the truth seekers, and the trolls. And sometimes the jokers who might be high at the time pop in to say something off the wall. It&#039;s like a stew. The longer you stick around, the more you&#039;ll see it and get used to it. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about your address, get yourself another drop or try to arrange something. But you shouldn&#039;t worry about your address otherwise, you can&#039;t do any business on SR. I wouldn&#039;t pass up on something of value being offered for free. If you feel cheated, here&#039;s the way to get something to make up for it.&nbsp; And I doubt the offer is indefinite. Was it a gift code? Those don&#039;t expire. At least not yet. There&#039;s talk of changing the system to set an expiration date or give vendors ability to revoke them. Whatever the deal is, maybe find out how long you&#039;ve got and try to get some reassurances from them. They do show themselves to be at least somewhat reasonable if others are getting taken care of. I don&#039;t know but if it were me, I&#039;d give it a shot.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I can&#039;t see a vendor like P. Rex sending out bunk pills on purpose. It doesn&#039;t make sense for a vendor to do that in escrow. It&#039;s the ones that try to get the buyer to FE that send out bunk product on purpose. Especially for International orders. <br /><br />And don&#039;t think of yourself as driving customers away unless you actually set out to do just that. But if by relaying your experience you caused some to have second thoughts, cold feet, or cancel an order, you actually did both the potential buyer and vendor a favor. I&#039;ll explain what I mean real quick. The placebo effect is a very real and strong effect in humans. Doesn&#039;t matter what the substance is. If the buyer believes that they might get bunk product, their expectation of the anticipated effect increases. As if it needs to be more real of an effect than is normal to prove to themselves that they got the real deal. So they may even think that perfectly good pills are weak because of that placebo effect of increased anticipation. That might sound counter-intuitive but that&#039;s the weird thing of it. <br /><br />So don&#039;t beat yourself up over it. Bad deals happen almost everyday on SR. Even the best of us goes through a bad experience at least once a year. I don&#039;t think anyone truly buys with confidence on here. After over almost 2 years on the road and well over 100 buys, I still buy expecting something to go wrong in the back of my mind. So I don&#039;t blow more than I can lose on any one buy. And if it&#039;s something I want by a certain date, I buy from two or three vendors just in case one or two flakes out on me. I hate that feeling of going to your drop thinking that today has to be the day only to find it didn&#039;t arrive... again.<br /><br />Anyway, rock on buddy. You&#039;ll be alright with whatever you decide to do.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

Like a rival vendor trying to discredit their competition that&#039;s underselling the market. But that&#039;s just speculation on my part. I&#039;m just adding things up and reading what people post. I&#039;ve seen this before with other vendors getting cut up by what looks like buyers but turned out to be the competition. There was a perc/oxy seller early this year who went through something like this and the rival vendor posted their competition&#039;s goodbye blowup message on their profile page like a trophy cause their campaign worked.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The percocet and roxicodone vendor was OneStop and his rival at the time was SouthStar. I was a part of that discussion which took place around January of this year. Mojo was taking jabs at SouthStar and pretty much exposed him as a vendor using a buyer account to discredit OneStop. Allegedly, there was also some interference being run on OneStop&#039;s international orders by SouthStar. IIRC, not a single one of OneStop&#039;s international packages made it through customs. I also had an order that never made it but I never got a love letter from Customs. About 5 weeks after I placed the international order, while it was still in transit &quot;limbo&quot;, OneStop did a reship and sent me my order from his domestic supply free of charge and told me I could keep the international one if it ever arrived. During that time, about 3 weeks after I placed my international order, OneStop also overnighted me about 20 - 25 pills.&nbsp; I forget exactly how many. But it was my first and only time I ever finalized early for an order. I was the first to order from his then new international offerings. I had a good relationship with OneStop. We&#039;d chat about a lot of things. Had some funny conversations about behind the scenes SR drama. He was a stand up guy where I was concerned. But if we weren&#039;t on such good terms, I would have lost out big time like everyone else who finalized early for the international order. I felt really bad about everyone who lost money with him. HE was a really good vendor and I would recommend him because of his great stealth, fast shipping (domestic) and fair prices. Plus he had the lowest opiate prices on SR. <br /><br />But OneStop also went through a claim of bad pills. Someone said they got sick from his pills (Mallinkrodt 512 percocet). It was a hoax but that was the alleged beginning of Southstar&#039;s campaign against OneStop.&nbsp; But there&#039;s no real way to prove it was SouthStar behind any of it. And when OneStar had a public melt down about the situation where he called his clients &quot;junkies&quot; (but excluded me), SouthStar posted the entirety of OneStop&#039;s farewell blow up post onto their seller profile and sported it like a winner&#039;s trophy for more than a month. <br /><br />SouthStar is still a vendor on SR, but his sales are really low in spite of his super low prices. <br /><br />That&#039;s the back-story on that deal. At least as much as I can remember without having to dig up the threads for a refresher. I think Mojo is seeing some similarities between what&#039;s going on with P. Rex and those claiming to have received bunk Adderalls. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s entirely possible that some people received bunk Adderalls. It&#039;s just hard to prove. Reading over your posts and your explanation above, you seem genuine enough. But you potentially put yourself at risk. And to be honest, I&#039;m glad you couldn&#039;t go that far to prove yourself.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t trust P. Rex., per se. But you never know who any vendor is on here and who they work with. And since they seem to be a group, you might have exposed yourself to many people you&#039;re not even aware that exist. P.Rex doesn&#039;t seem like the type that&#039;s going to go send some hitmen after you or some nonsense like that. But since you don&#039;t know the extent of their operation, someone from there could have blackmailed to you give them money or else they would report you to the &quot;authorities.&quot; There was a Meth Vendor that threatened a few buyers like that. VortexMilkman. Colorful character. When you have time, do a search on that guy. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you got something instead of nothing. 33% is not the best but at least it&#039;s something. Something is always better than nothing. But everything is better than something and nothing. :) <br /><br />Why didn&#039;t you take them up on their free 20 pill offer? Was it not really free in the sense that they asked you to pay shipping or some other fee? If it&#039;s totally free, I say go for it. They wouldn&#039;t send you bunk pills a second time. And if they did, what have you got to lose? But even if you didn&#039;t want the pills to use personally, after you test a piece of one, you could sell them to people you trust and recoup some more money that way. Addy street prices range from $10 to maybe $15 each. So that&#039;s about $200-$300 in your pocket.&nbsp; Even if you could only sell them for $8 or $9 each you&#039;re still getting something more. If their offer is still on the table, definitely consider taking it. That might be a first for any vendor to do as far as I can remember. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about them getting your address again and doing something stupid against you, Don&#039;t. But the easy way around having to worry about it is to change your feedback score to 5/5 from wherever it is now so they&#039;ll have nothing to really hold against you. Seriously, if they are offering some more compensation after they gave you a refund after you finalized, it means they&#039;re not holding a grudge or anything and they might be believing you. Unless there&#039;s more to it than you&#039;re telling us, like you&#039;re blackmailing them and that&#039;s why they are offering more. But you don&#039;t seem the type to me.&nbsp; Plus a vendor can counter a blackmail attempt with a blackmail threat of their own. Also remember, you can always update your feedback it if they send you bunk meds again. But I can&#039;t see them or any vendor doing that. What would be the point? That would only make things worse.<br /><br />Some vendors overly fixate on their feedback score. Sometimes they don&#039;t realize that buyers will buy from a vendor as long as feedback is 80 or above, the price is a little better than everyone else&#039;s and current feedback left by buyers shows consecutive 5/5&#039;s and relatively good things to say for 1 or 2 pages.&nbsp; I personally would give and haven given vendors a shot if their score is below 90 and they are looking to bring their score up. You can get some of the best deals and best service during those times. I got free overnight shipping one time with some extra goodies inside. <br /><br />My advice to you is to get what you can from this place, as often as you can. Practice safe sex... erm... I mean safe security and some common sense so you don&#039;t end up behind bars. And stay off the vendor blacklists. Not every vendor uses it. But if they have a forum presence and a SR vendor tag under their name, they probably do. But new vendors don&#039;t follow any blacklists because they have no access to any. And new vendor&#039;s ratings are super sensitive to bad feedback. So new vendors aim to please.&nbsp; A lot of them get blackmailed but mostly from SR veteran buyers since veteran buyer feedback carries more numerically damaging weight because of SR&#039;s feedback algorithm. <br /><br /><br />TL;DR: Take P Rex up on offer to get 20 free pills. You can eat them or sell them to friends or people you trust and recoup more of your loss. You seem like a good guy that got a raw deal. Just be careful about giving up your anonymity for any reason as there&#039;s is no valid reason to give it up. Good luck. I hope your next buys on SR go better. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Ben&#039;s brain and&nbsp; memory must have taken some abuse since he found SR, and now his cloudiness is showing.&nbsp; There was no vendor on vendor &quot;interference&quot; or me placing any orders from Onestop.&nbsp; Onestop sold Percocets from the USA, his supplier came from China.&nbsp; I ship from China, Googleeyed, Onestop, and I all have the same supplier.&nbsp; To push me out of business, Onestop dropped his price to $2 and started to ship directly from China.After dealing with the suppliers, I can tell you the worst thing you can do is send them $10,000&#039;s of dollars and not expect them to scam you.&nbsp; <br />That is what happened, Googleeyed went through the same problem.<br /><br />One last thing, Onestop had about 6 accounts on SR, he was a classic flea market salesman. When he ran out of his products he scam and ran.<br />His other accounts included, One Stop Shop, Kushkings, and some other names I forgot.&nbsp; They all sold the same products including the same vacuum packed Chinese percocet.<br /><br /><br />FYI unlike Googleyed I managed to get resupplied from China and I am selling percocet for $1.99 min 500 for those who FE.&nbsp; &nbsp;All prices over 2.99 for those who quantity or to FE.
