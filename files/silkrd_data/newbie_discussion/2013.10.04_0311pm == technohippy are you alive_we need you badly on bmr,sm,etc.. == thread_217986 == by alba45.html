				He was one of the best vendors on the road I found, I have a single nintendo pill left, I placed an order for 100 on Tuesday, would have been here by now usually. Damm. <br /><br />Thank you for the service you provided.<br /><br />Shame he hasn&#039;t been on forums in about a month or so, probably too busy really!<br />

				If SR is CIA then I doubt the vendors will show up at all..<br /><br />If SR is CIA then all vendors got some safetywork to do since I bet CIA can hire hackers that is skilled enough to findout the location of vendors computers.<br /><br />You will probably not get any money back since this is a robbery and some vendors probably knew about the robbery to and they probably lowered their prices and got some superdrugs and recieved alot of orders the days before and then they just stole that money before CIA did the robbery.<br /><br />CIA the biggest cocainsmuggelers in the world just want you to know that they dont allow drugs to be sold when they need to divide and conquer humanity..<br /><br />
