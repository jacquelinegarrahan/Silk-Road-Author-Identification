				So, I lost my forum presence for a while due to lost password and trying to get hold of support/admin to help sort it.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the pm&#039;s I received while I was away, will be replied to tonight.<br /><br />Also, accept my apologies in advanced for (possibly) bumping older threads. Promised to write reviews, leave feedback etc on orders, and I fully intend to honour those promises.<br /><br />For those of you that don&#039;t know me, I&#039;ve been here about a month and I post in the forum.. a lot... lol

				Must be nice to be able to return, i was away for 15 mins and could&#039;nt get bak in. My trust nothing if some one is making a dollar out of it mind set cant but help entertain the notion that the 50 post rule feels like a government running interference on big business who are damaging the community but feeding the purse of government of the day. Feel empathy for those communitys and feel very vunerable when making a purchase that other than feedback will have no voice to debate my position and get heard. Hope there is no collusion or arrangement between any parties that might profit from those that dont have the tools of comeback.<br />Man i really should just break this down and post word for word, got to get to 50<br />Love and peace to admins and all honest vendors and buyers<br />
