				My experience with Fentanyl Citrate including Harm Reduction<br /><br />The purpose of this post is to communicate my experience with using near pure fentanyl citrate and to give some harm reduction information to those that choose to use this drug. I have seen&nbsp; number of posts asking for instructions on how to use fentanyl citrate safely.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is of critical importance that the potential user have a solid understanding of fentanyl prior to use. This is of critical importance due to its extremely high potency compared to other opiate pain killers. I would strongly discourage the use of fentanyl by anyone that does not already have a strong tolerance to opiate pain killers. <br /><br />I had been using hundreds of mgs of codeine a day for several years prior to the use of fentanyl. My primary reason for choosing fentanyl over other opiate pain killers available was the extremely low cost when compared to an average dose of other available opiates. I was confident my opiate tolerance at the time was sufficient to use fentanyl safely. I was also sufficiently confident that I was able to handle, prepare and use fentanyl citrate safely. If the potential user is not sure of the previous two points, I would strongly discourage use. <br /><br />After receiving the fentanyl I set about preparations for use. I personally being entirely a&nbsp; prescription drug user had no interest in injecting or smoking this drug. I was primarily concerned with the safest use of this drug rather then&nbsp; getting the best high. As such I wont discuss either smoking or injecting, I believe both are far to risky to be worth partaking in. This is just my personal opinion. I focused solely on preparing&nbsp; fentanyl nasal spray (explained below). I prepared a spray that contained approximately 330 mcg/ml of saline solution. I used approximately 100mg over a 10 day period and then an additional 250mgs over an immediate 7 day period. Shortly into the second period of time I came to the conclusion that the tolerance I was building up and the amount I would have to take was not sustainable and would likely lead to a very strong addiction. The previous point is a very important one to consider prior to use. Considering the average fentanyl patch dispenses 100mcg per hour, 100mg of fentanyl would be equivalent to approximately 1000&nbsp; - 100mcg (1 hour) doses depending on the specific fentanyl salt used. Fentanyl hcl is significantly stronger then fentanyl citrate. In this post, I am specifically referring to the use of fentanyl citrate. Once a user has consumed even 100mg of fentanyl, they will go through extreme withdrawals if not properly weened off. Again, the previous point is a very important one to consider. Is trying this drug worth the inevitable withdrawals, no matter how minor? <br /><br />Preparation of Fentanyl Citrate into a Nasal Spray&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1. Be extremely careful when handling fentanyl, it is an extremely potent drug that can be absorbed through membranes in the mouth, nose , eyes, etc, etc. Where personal protective equivalent (PPE) at all times when handling the fentanyl citrate salt! This includes long sleeves, latex gloves or equivalent and face mask as not to inhale air borne particles if for some reason the powder becomes airborne (spillage). This may seem excessive, however considering fentanyl is approximately 100 times stronger then morphine and 50 times stronger the pure heroin (Diacetylmorphine), this is not a drug to handle carelessly.<br />2. I would not use tap water or anything less then saline solution or distilled water to make nasal spray. Tap water has been found to contain brain eating amoebas (Naegleria fowleri ) in water mains that feed houses in some places in the USA. The only way for the amoeba to get into your system is to be forced up the nasal passage. Enough said. I prefer saline solution, the type from the drug store have components to help prevent bacteria from growing. I wont go specifically into the specific components. Purchase at least one 300ml bottle of saline solution approved for use as a nasal spray as well as at least one 30ml bottle of saline nasal spray. I recommend getting the simplest type of 30ml nasal spray bottles, the type you squeeze on each side rather then the type you pull the trigger on either side of the tip down towards the base. I found that type leaked a lot.<br />3. This preparation is based on 100mg of fentanyl citrate salt (It was approximately 98% pure without checking). After putting on PPE, carefully open the package containing the fentanyl and pour it into the 300ml bottle of saline solution. Agitate thoroughly to ensure the fentanyl dissolves fully and evenly. 100mg of fentanyl will dissolve into 300ml of saline solution with no problem. You will now have a saline solution containing approximately 300mcg per ml. <br />4. Empty the 30ml bottle of saline nasal spray and you now have a pocket size dispenser for your saline/fentanyl solution.<br />5. If you wish to dilute further, take a second identical empty 300ml bottle and then split the prepared fentanyl solution between the two bottles, using a scale to ensure both bottles weigh the same and thus have exactly the same amount of fluid in them. Then top up with 150ml of saline solution. A scale that can measure down to one hundredth of a gram is more then adequate. There are many ways to dilute fentanyl safely, however it would be extremely unwise in my opinion to attempt to weigh fentanyl while still in its solid form. Even if you have a good drug scale from a head shop that measures to 1 thousandths of a gram, you are still only dealing in mgs when safe dosages of fentanyl are in the low mcgs for a naive fentanyl user. If there is any issue with the scale when measuring such a minute amount of powder, one bottle could potentially end up with significantly more fentanyl. This is why I suggest dissolving the whole amount into one bottle and then splitting the contents of the bottle. It is important to ensure the fentanyl is fully dissolved prior to separating.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try a small amount first and see what effect it has. Progress from there keeping in mind this is a very potent drug that overdose is particularly prevalent with. One important note that I have not made so far – fentanyl has a very short half life and consequently is removed from your system very quickly. You will need to be taking this at very minimum every 6 hours from my experience. I found if I didn’t take a good dose before bed, I would wake up with minor withdrawals hours later. My body got accustomed to waking up every few hours, having a snort and then going back to sleep. <br /><br />Withdrawing off Fentanyl Citrate <br /><br />The aim here is to withdraw off fentanyl with the least amount of withdrawal symptoms. The process entails slowly reducing the amount you are taking per day and then supplementing with a lesser opiate when needed to help prevent withdrawals. (When available). I used codeine for this. Give yourself plenty of fentanyl solution to use so that you can slowly come off. Each morning when I prepared my small bottle, I would pour in less of the saline/fentanyl solution and then top off with the pure saline solution. Every 1 or 2 days I would lower the amount of saline/fentanyl solution in the bottle and more pure saline solution in. Despite reducing the fentanyl and loading up on codeine, I still had some minor withdrawals. Mostly being restless, not sleeping, etc. Symptoms can be different for each user. The overall point is to reduce your overall fentanyl intake, as much as possible prior to stopping. I have heard fentanyl withdrawals can be extremely nasty so this process is definitely worth noting. <br /><br />In conclusion, I hope potential users read this and make at least a semi informed decision on their use of this drug. For additional information, the product monograph has lots of valuable information as well as the Erowid website.<br /><br />DSCCC333&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
