				Get a private mailbox or PO box. I&#039;d suggest a PMB from a small mom and pop place, as they&#039;re generally more lax about ID stuff, if you can find one. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard of another alternative, but can&#039;t for the life of me remember what it&#039;s called. I&#039;m sure someone would bring it up though.

				Plenty of people order to their home address with no problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having a drop is an extra layer of security, but by no means essential.<br />As-long as your buy from a trusted vendor who has good stealth packaging, you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Also, you can order to your home address using a false name. When it arrives, write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the envelope and leave it alone for a few days. So that if by some miracle LE do come knocking, you already have plausible denial on your side.<br />Packages are delivered to a property, not an inhabitant.<br /><br />Anonymous PO box is a good idea, but you still have to go get the thing.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you&#039;re ordering a small amount of gear, your home address is fine.

				I use my home because i don&#039;t have anywhere else and have not had any problems yet, and hopefully won&#039;t. I think as long as you keep your amounts reasonable you will be fine

				Newbie here on SR, so take this for what it&#039;s worth. Not so new to the overall scene, so maybe it&#039;s worth something...<br /><br />Drops are desirable (and necessary) for pros who are running lots of packages and big volume into their addresses. For a personal user, I think the security provided by SR&#039;s normal packaging standards (and you should research any vendor to make sure they are using best practices) is perfectly fine and safe.&nbsp; Now that everyone shops online, the world is SWAMPED with small packages being delivered by all sorts of means. No one has the time or inclination to worry about your specific little package. As long as it doesn&#039;t reek of weed (and probably even if it does), your chances of having a problem approach zero. My opinion is that you place yourself at more risk with suspicious activities like &#039;anonymous&#039; PO boxes or dead drops.&nbsp; Nothing is 100% guaranteed, but I would argue that you&#039;re much much safer in the SR system and receiving the occasional package at home than you would be under any other scenario of buying drugs that I&#039;ve ever encountered<br /><br />SR is providing a fantastic service by making a marketplace with open communication among and between buyer and sellers. We are all safer for it.&nbsp; God bless the internet...

				Are you buying for personal use or to sell? If it&#039;s for personal use and you aren&#039;t buying weed, I&#039;d say just ship it to your house. Make sure you use your real name though and not some stupid fake one. That will look super sketchy, especially if you&#039;re ordering internationally.
