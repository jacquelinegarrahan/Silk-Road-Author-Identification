				Hi!<br /><br />I wonder if I have misunderstood something or if 50 posts are needed to reach the seniors area. If so: why? Sure, good to read about common problems and all, but it takes years to load the pages and 50 posts are just overkill. Why not just give all info thats needed and let the noobs read it and then be done with it?<br /><br />Might have misunderstood something. Takes time to load pages and I haven&#039;t read much yet.

				Ok, I understand. Too bad people have to fuck things up.<br /><br />But one thing that&#039;s more stupid than spambots is this thing that the post doesn&#039;t get posted if someone posted something just before in the same thread. &quot;Someone posted a spam to reach 50 asap, please try to post again&quot;. Depressing.

				The 50 posts are to do with a spamming basket case who would target newbies and F, up the forum so there&#039;s no way in ell he or she is gonna sit there making new accounts like before knowing he or she is stuck untill they reach 50 posts also if the spammer started on here he&#039;d get stopped as soon as he or she started so this is why 50 posts are needed thank the robbing thieving scumbag scammer for it ok your very lucky cos if this wasn&#039;t in pkace he or she would&#039;ve preyed on you and probably robbed you at that so it&#039;s a good thing ok hope this helped you out
