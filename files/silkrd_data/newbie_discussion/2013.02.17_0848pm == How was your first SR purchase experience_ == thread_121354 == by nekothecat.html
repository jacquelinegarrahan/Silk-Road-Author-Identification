				I&#039;ll start;<br /><br />I had a bit difficulty with the PGP encryption so when I finally thought I had it down I purchased some MDMA from puzzle. Except I asked him to confirm it before I sent the address to him. The dude pulls a dick move and cancels my order shorting me some change (I think BTC dropped or some of it got stuck in escrow I don&#039;t know). Anywho I ended up not having enough money to buy from him and ended up buying from someone else much much nicer and cooler.<br /><br />I understand sellers have a process, but I am the customer. The customer isn&#039;t always right but if you can&#039;t take a few seconds out of your busy time to assist me with the purchase, then I don&#039;t want to buy your product. Who knows what else you cut out of your product.<br /><br />How was your experience?

				my first purchase went swimmingly and only took 4 days to arrive. subsequent purchases from that vendor did not go over well at all however. <br />each purchase, vendor, seller, and item is different so each experince is different for every one. even seasoned sr pros get scammed every once in a while

				I was buying MDMA from Pfandleiher back in the day from my previous account. I needed to wait like 2weeks because there was no more of that batch, but finally after he sended it and I received it I couldn&#039;t believe that SR isn&#039;t a one big scam and works.<br />My first MDMA was that :)

				Mine was flawless. I am a bit of a techie, so encryption was not a problem for me, and the vendor I choose was awesome in every way. It really all depends on who you choose to be the one that takes your SR virginity. Choose right and you will have a wonderful experience. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121354.msg834099#msg834099">Quote from: 3AdYSv7bW8Nu5XfZ0I8W on February 17, 2013, 09:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Honestly?

If you choose the right vendor, it will get through. DrWhite and Nevita have awesome stealth and it is pretty much guaranteed to get to you, unless you have the absolute worst luck in all history. A PO box is NOT recommended, it is perfectly fine to receive it to your house. The only time I would be worried at all is if I was receiving large bulk orders. If you stick to personal amounts you will be alright. There are plenty of tips around on the forums as well on how to handle potential CDs and how to respond if you think your package was flagged.

				My first experience was great with a proven vendor who was more than helpful for n00bs.&nbsp; To be honest I think we have to respect the marketplace but encounter it with a certain different set of expectations from usual places we go like the old Walmart.&nbsp; There are many reasons a vendor might get spooked and choose to back out and do you think you might feel the same way?&nbsp; Sorry it was a hassle but we&#039;ve got to be on our games as buyers as well.&nbsp; Good luck in the future and I&#039;m glad subsequent work has been fine.

				First transaction was a mess.

				My first order was $200, so far nothing and it&#039;s been 14 business days. Still talking to the vendor though so I won&#039;t post who it is. Seems to be legitimate though. I did FE, which is why I only spent that much as I can afford to lose it. Second order with someone else placed just a few days ago with no FE, if it doesn&#039;t come then I definitely need to send it somewhere else.

Since then I have made a few purchases but i still get sketched out when&nbsp; i order so i don&#039;t do it too often. Anyway good luck to the rest of you.

				I bought a few things my first time. I remember being very nervous while doing it and paranoid to check the mail or sign for things. I bought some molly. It was good. Used to get DMT for cheap from MoonUnit. I wonder what happened to that guy. Used to get the bomb MDA from MontelWilliams. Didn&#039;t he go scammer too!? I&#039;ve never had a bad transaction yet. Although I did order a half o once of mol from a vendor once. Didn&#039;t feel right and they sent me a sketchy invitation to business off the road. I feel like I was being watched after that. Had to go underground for a while in my home town. I still don&#039;t know if it had anything to do with the people that were trying to set me up, but my gut told me it did. I wanted to warn people about this vendor, but I knew I had no proof so I just stayed off the Road for a couple months.

				My first purchase went very well, much smoother than I expected.&nbsp; I used bitinstant with a small amount of money first just to make sure they would actually make it to my SR wallet.&nbsp; In about an hour they did and this was exciting for me.&nbsp; After researching all the vendors that had the products I wanted I found one that didn&#039;t require FE, has many transactions and great feedback.&nbsp; I messaged him/her and then placed the order and I recieved my product&nbsp; in 2 days with great stealth.&nbsp; SR is an amazing service and when used right it seems safer than local dealers.

				Going slowly so far. Have 2 orders (edibles) in with no response back - first one was last Tuesday, so this week it&#039;s on to messaging to break things loose one way or another. I decided to just put the orders in (small starter amounts) without any prior messaging to the vendors, so maybe that was a strategic error. I&#039;m trying to be low maintenance, but so far I&#039;m low result.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t lost any money and don&#039;t have anything at risk that I can&#039;t afford, but it&#039;s hard to be patient.
