				The vendors on SR are some of the most professional people I have ever met. I cannot believe how friendly everyone is and how people here will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied. All my research chemical orders came with MSDS sheets, vendors have been very prompt in getting back to me. Stealth is absolutely amazing, and delivery is timely. Out of the three orders that have arrived, every single one has not only met my expectations but exceeded them, I honestly don&#039;t think I will buy anything off the streets ever again.<br /><br />People here seem to know what they are doing and I cant even get this level of customer service at a five star restaurant. I just wanted to say that I believe in this community albeit being initially skeptical and I wish I would have gotten involved sooner, its sad to think about how much money I wasted buying sub-par cut up products on the street. For the first time I can buy molly and have a reasonable assurance of it actually being MDMA.<br /><br />here. So far Ive just ordered some RCs and MDMA but I&#039;m going to do some larger orders now of some cannabis and LSD. My god, for once I can buy LSD and actually get LSD (which is usually just some RC anymore when buying on the streets), I don&#039;t even feel the need to reagent test everything I buy before consumption, hell alot of vendors will do that for me.<br /><br />I love you guys

				Very true. i feel the same, why ever bother going to the streets when you got this top quality product and vendors. And because of SR system they need to Take care of every Costumer to maintain their stats. It is not the same as on the streets.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I love about it, the way its set up provides an incentive for the vendors to be honest. Alot of them I think are just great people though and really care about what they do not just trying to make cash. If it didn&#039;t cost so much to become a vendor I would definitely do it.

				Good customer service is the difference between a 99% feedback rating and a 89% feedback rating.

				You know what though, I actually don&#039;t have a problem ordering from new vendors because everyone deserves a chance and I truly believe most of the vendors here really are trying to help people out and do care. That being said I primarily am into psychedelics which tends to draw in a less greedy crowd. I dont know about the heroin vendors or coke vendors but you know i&#039;m sure alot of them are good people to.

				Actually whats shocks me most is a lot of vendors offer to refund you or reship the item.&nbsp; My experience with lost items in legal businesses has rarely offered such options.&nbsp; <br />They just keep the money and wash their hands of any responsibility as soon as they&#039;ve handed it to the post.<br /><br />And then if they do try and recover the item or get it on its way well you have to deal with the postal service. (thinking of dhl and how incompetent they are) And then you have to argue on whose responsibility it is to go complain to the postman.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually the vendors but how often do they actually try and sort out your problem?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen many more satisfied people here than anywhere else with any other legal business.

				^^ Haha, thats sad isnt it. My drug dealers have better customer service than legit businesses. I tried to order a replacement wick for my e-go electronic cigarette a while back and it never came. Tried to contact them, never got a response. I think I would rather buy everyday items on silkroad too lol.

				For sure, the best vendors have better service than amazon or any of the leading clearnet sites. When you get people with good business sense as vendors it really shows through.
