				This will be my first trip on 25i, I&#039;m more of a fan of LSD naturally.&nbsp; I took two tabs.&nbsp; I&#039;m at a friends house and the vibes are right.&nbsp; There is also plenty of nature outside since the friend lives practically in the woods.&nbsp; Any advise on what to do or what to expect?

				I never feel right on the 25s for some reason. Im comfortable with intense visuals and all and I really love the 2Cs but there something about 25i that just seems a bit off or wrong to me. Like kronic instead of weed or something. Just not right.<br /><br />But thats just me.Enjoy your trip 8)
