				Well they&#039;re called Skins here in UK. But if you want coffee, you get nescaffe, you want a beer you get Bud, you want a spliff, you get Rizla, the one and only, especially the silver ultra thin ones.

				King size slim silver Rizlas are my standard, and I&#039;ll only use blue Rizlas if i cannot acquire anything to a standard with silvers. OCB rips are good for this. <br /><br />One time at a party, a guy was going on a shop run and I asked him to pick me up some silvers. he brought me reds. i was not impressed, they smoke like newspapers. Never again. <br /><br />I also love Raw papers, especially the uncreased ones you can get, and the mega size 12&quot; papers&nbsp; :) My sister once brought me back some Brown Sugar blunt papers that were chocolate flavour. rolls like papers, burns like a blunt. with a sticky strip for licking. they were the bomb. I used to love Juicy Jay&#039;s but the smoke was too thick, and the watermelon flavour burned green flames.

				Any cheap cigar that has an outer leaf that can be unwrapped and then re-wrapped around the blunt. <br /><br />I can&#039;t for the life of me roll a decent joint (and honestly a lot of friends who insisted they rolled awesome joints couldn&#039;t either.) Years later, when I got into RYO unfiltered tobacco and spent the 3 bucks on a machine (probably shoulda done that when I actively smoked mj) it was whatever came with the tobacco.

				Erm, I got mine from amazon, but they don&#039;t seem to be there anymore, they have them for about four pounds on some headshop sites though, which isn&#039;t bad considering you get a fair few papers in them, great as a novelty thing though.

				Probably raw. Rizla blues are decent enough though I find they can get a bit flimsy if your rolling a long spliff. Rizla silver are waaay too airy fairy.<br /><br />Least favourite: Rizla reds/liqorice and any coloured papers that taste like marker pens.
