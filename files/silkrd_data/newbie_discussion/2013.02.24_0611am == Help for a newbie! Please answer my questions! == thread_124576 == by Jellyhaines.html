				So, I&#039;m real sorry to be so inexperienced and not knowledgeable but all this is very daunting and new to me, i want to get everything crystal clear before i go doing something really silly! I guess what I&#039;m asking for is just some re assurance a couple of things! Better safe then sorry right?<br /><br />First of all, I will only be doing Domestic trades, I don&#039;t have the balls to order anything from overseas, I&#039;ve already had troubles with the law and thats surely something I wouldn&#039;t wanna be involved in again. Also finding vendors isn&#039;t my worry at all, I&#039;ve already got a few lined up that I&#039;d like to use. So here goes.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Questions for anyone -<br /><br />1. Is it safe to order very small amounts from stealthy vendors domestically to your house? Or more wise to open up a P O Box?<br />2. What does Eskrow mean? I can&#039;t really seem to understand it fully aside from that fact its in relation to using the PGP encryption system. I think I&#039;ll be able to manage that part fine as I&#039;m computer savvy, but if you&#039;d like to link me to a thread with some steps that&#039;d be cool.<br />3. So from the research I&#039;ve done I&#039;m guessing to get Bitcoins I have to get a bitcoin wallet and such, do I have to go into a bank and make a cash deposit to purchase them or is it safe to do it online? It&#039;d be a lot less hassle doing it online!<br /><br />I basically would just really appreciate some great tips and advice for someone starting out here. Australians I&#039;d really appreciate the help hahaha. I&#039;m just a opi user from NZ wanting to get some gear over here safe and reliably without getting myself into shit. <br /><br />- Questions for Australians -<br /><br />So what is domestic mail like? I&#039;ve heard its the same as in NZ and they don&#039;t check it as it&#039;d clog up the system and people would get pissed, making it virtually 100% safe trusting you package everything discreet. My mate used to get Acetic Anhydride and Morphine sent down to him from the city back in NZ with no problems. I&#039;ve already asked an australian vendor and he re assured me they don&#039;t ever really check domestic mail.
