				Could the &quot;DPR&quot; they found today, be the original one and not the one who currently has control over the road? They&#039;re showing emails form the &quot;early&quot; days of SR, but in the Forbes Interview he said that he was not the original DPR. Maybe the new DPR, hit the killswitch until all the shit dies down.<br />Just an idea? Possible??<br /><br /><br />This is from the DPR (from princess brides) wiki article<br />It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired. The former Roberts stays aboard as first mate, referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;, and thereby establishing the new Roberts&#039; persona. After the crew is convinced, the former Roberts leaves the ship and retires on his earnings.<br /><br /><br />I have faith all is ok... DPR is not a man but a belief....

				So he&#039;s not the one who has control over SR but SR is now down and supposedly taken over by the FBI?

If I were the DEA / FBI I would keep quiet about what&#039;s been confiscated and start going through them as quick as possible.
