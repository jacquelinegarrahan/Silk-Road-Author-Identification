				I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with Bitinstant. Although I have also seen numerous reports of people claiming they never received there BC.

				What location do you find yourself in at present?<br /><br />There used to be so many convenient ways to acquire BTC from the UK but as of late, it&#039;s a fucking mission.<br /><br />I now get them via SR from established BTC vendors. Sure, I pay a 15% &quot;fee&quot; but it&#039;s basically the only way I&#039;ve found to do it. If anyone knows a better way, do let me know!<br /><br />I did sign up for a OKPAY account but have yet to use it. It&#039;s basically like a PayPal in Germany. I&#039;ve also hear that PayPal is &quot;thinking&quot; of allowing BTC trade! Fingers crossed!!

				u know the online wallet blockchain sells coins via SMS or lanline. You could buy a throw away phone and purchase them that way. I don&#039;t have experience actually buying from them though.

You give someone real money, they sell you the value in btc. You then store your coins in a wallet, and use them to buy things. <br />The whole process can seem a bit intricate at first, but after you&#039;ve done it once or twice, you&#039;ll be fine.<br />Just keep an eye on the btc rates. They change quicker than the weather.

				Now that bitfloor is down I&#039;d go with bitinstant or maybe CampBX.. CampBX accepts USPS money transfer which doesn&#039;t seem too bad, I&#039;ve never tried it but I don&#039;t think you need an ID. If you do, then don&#039;t use it. There&#039;s also bitstamp that accepts bank deposits I think.<br />There&#039;s also blockchain that accepts SMS payment like someone else mentionned... Or localbitcoins.com that doesn&#039;t seem too bad, it&#039;s pretty anonymous, except the prices are usually higher there, but not as high as with SR vendors.

				stick with mtgox<br /><br />Lots of people complain about them but they have 70% market share&nbsp; &amp; they are reliable <br /><br />dont send your money straight from mtgox to silkroad.&nbsp; <br /><br />simple example : mtgox - online wallet - silkroad.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				You can always try craigslist or localbitcoins. That way there isn&#039;t a trail to your bank account if you live in a metro area.

				I use an online BT wallet with Blockchain. You can deposit BTC&#039;s into it via moneygram, moneygram is at any Walmart and CVS, among others but seems like everyone is relatively close to either one. Then move your BTC&#039;s from blockchain to The Road. With this method, you can be funded in an afternoon, it&#039;s really quick. I&#039;ve done it a bunch of times without a hitch. I&#039;m in the good ole U.S of A, I don&#039;t know if it would be any different if you live outside the US. Good Luck!
