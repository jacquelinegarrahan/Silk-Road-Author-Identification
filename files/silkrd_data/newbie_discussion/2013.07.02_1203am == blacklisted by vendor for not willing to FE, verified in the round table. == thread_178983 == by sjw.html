				You haven&#039;t explained what happened&nbsp; to get you &quot;blacklisted&quot; I honestly cant see SR admin &#039;blacklisting&#039; you fro NOT FEing!&nbsp; <br />btw, from what I know, the &#039;blacklist&#039; is just the list vendors put customers THEY dont like, but many vendors will take you at &#039;face value&#039; if you pm then before ordering and saying &#039;hello&#039;&nbsp; :)&nbsp; IF you do have good stats, there&#039;s no reason for them not to give you a chance ...escrow works for us ALL!<br />&nbsp;<br />It&#039;s difficult to point you at the right part of the forum, I&#039;d go to the index page and see if it seems to &#039;fit&#039; in one of the topics<br /><br />Go to the vendors thread in The Rumor Mill and gently make your point there ... mistakes happen and MOST vendors will do their best to fix them<br /><br />And if you have no joy there, you can always pm SR High command and ask them to reconsider the facts ... they&#039;re usually pretty fair<br /><br />All the best&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />motek<br /><br />P.s. Dutch, what are your talking about bro, I cant quite understand ... you CAN leave feedback UNLESS you FE ..&nbsp; ???&nbsp; Let us know what happened and we&#039;ll try to help&nbsp; :D

				You are not on the blacklist, you are on the irresponsible buyer list. The vendor is annoyed that you did not read his policies about FE and that you canceled the order because you did not agree to the rules you should have read.<br /><br />I don&#039;t require FE but I am constantly dealing with people who don&#039;t read my policies before ordering and it is a major pain in the ass.

				Just so we all know, how do you write to the &quot;SR High command&quot; if you have a problem such as the one the fellow who started this thread had?&nbsp; If a buyer has a problem with a bad vendor, can that vendor blacklist the buyer?&nbsp; Supposing a vendor is mad if you write a truthful review and give only 1 star.&nbsp; Can he blacklist you through the &#039;vendors roundtable&#039;?&nbsp; I ask because I have had my first bad experience with a vendor and if he doesn&#039;t straighten out our deal I will of course leave him a one star review and explain what happened.&nbsp; If a vendor can get you on a blacklist that would discourage people from writing honest (bad) reviews.&nbsp; Does anyone know the procedure which the vendors roundtable goes through before a buyer is blacklisted?&nbsp;

				Unfortunately some vendors &quot;policies&quot; are confusing, or sometimes makes no sense!<br /><br />&nbsp;This makes things tricky ... if you are confused the best thing to do is pm them,&nbsp; AND put a heading on the pm, it makes it stand out from all the other! ;)<br /><br />vendors who respond quickly to pm&#039;s re doing deals&nbsp; get my respect, and the vendors who make it so easy to work with them, I will do almost&nbsp; anything!&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; <br /><br />However I can understand the frustrations of vendors with folks who look at their &quot;policies&quot; and juts think&nbsp; &quot;TL:DR&quot;&nbsp; and go on to FE with some scammer or who knows what! ::)<br /><br />Hey Tell. howzitgoin matey everything going ok?&nbsp; I cant say I&#039;ve read your policies, but I&#039;ll make a note to do so, take it easy broo&nbsp; ;) 8)<br /><br /><br />mmmmm motek&nbsp; 8)

				I just want to clarify that the Vendor Blacklist in the Vendor Roundtable is an informal list kept amongst vendors; it has no official standing on the site, nor is it supported by Silk Road.<br /><br />Vendors are free to keep such informal lists amongst themselves (as buyers are - and do - in the Rumor Mill) as long as they do not reveal a buyer&#039;s personal information.<br /><br />Libertas

				sorry for late response, i dont care about the loss of order ect the fact is i ended up on there cause i refused to FE which DPR reccommends a no no. <br /><br />So im on a list and if i wanted something in the future and somevendor says no your on blacklist.. <br /><br />Then what wait till hell freezes over?. I know its an open market and i left him the feedback he rightly deserves about 20 lines of text on the idiot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not a fair practice at all.&nbsp; I have been a member 3 times longer than the vendor. Ahh well i guess this is what will happen when the floodgates are open to all and sundrie to start vending, makes me wonder how old he actually is in the first instance, talked to me like one responded to me like one too. (14) I would guess.<br /><br />Ahh well next time il go with the quality vendors not these 2 bit penny punching newbs, springing up all over the place.<br /><br />

				Hi Libertas.&nbsp; Ok, so vendors can keep a list of buyers who have been troublesome, essentially a &#039;blacklist&#039;, informal as it might be.&nbsp; So supposing that you buy from a vendor and find that the quality of the stuff that yoo bought is very poor and was misrepresented in the listing.&nbsp; After messaging the vendor to discuss this (before leaving a review) you get a hostile and unprofessional response and discover that the vendor is (not to put to fine a point on it) an asshole.&nbsp; You can&#039;t come to an agreement with such a person so you take the loss and leave a 1 point review, summing up your experience with the vendor and the quality of the product.&nbsp; So the vendor, in retaliation, tries to get you blacklisted in the vendor&#039;s &#039;roundtable&#039;.&nbsp; How does the roundtable check out the vendor&#039;s claim that the buyer is an asshole?&nbsp; In other words, is there some process by which the roundtable checks out the vendor&#039;s claim that the buyer should be blacklisted?&nbsp; If a vendor can blacklist you in retaliation for leaving a bad review that would totally screw up the whole purpose of leaving reviews.&nbsp; &nbsp;Buyers would be afraid to leave honest reviews if they risk getting blacklisted.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Most of this forum is buyers posting opinions on vendors, include complaining about behavior that they don&#039;t like. Vendors also talk about buyers and complain about behavior they don&#039;t like.<br /><br />The posting about sjw is not an automatic exclusion or ban. It simply says that this buyer did not read the policies and had to cancel because of that. Other vendors can decide what they want to do with this information.<br /><br />This is not different than when a buyer comes here to complain about how a seller did this or that. The threads that list problem buyers(there are a few) are not scarlet letters than bar you from future buys, they are just critisisms that other vendors can read and act on as they see fit.<br /><br />The forums are here so that we can share our opinion of each other with other buyers and sellers.

				Royalblue, what you have written is absolutely true.&nbsp; You&#039;ve hit nail on the head.&nbsp; So if you have an unpleasant experience with a vendor and leave a bad review, and the vendor is a total asshole (there are not many, but there are a few), he/she can make you out to be a &#039;problem&#039; buyer.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is a flaw in the system and I&#039;m not sure how it can be remedied.&nbsp; I remember there was a similar problem on ebay where buyers were reluctant to leave honest but bad reviews because the vendor in question could retaliate by leaving a bad review of the buyer.&nbsp; I think this was ultimately remedied though I cannot remember the details.&nbsp; In any case, you&#039;ve articulated the problem very well.&nbsp;
