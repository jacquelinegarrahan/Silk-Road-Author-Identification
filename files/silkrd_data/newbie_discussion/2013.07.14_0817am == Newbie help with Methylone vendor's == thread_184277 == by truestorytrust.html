				I am trying to make my first transaction on SR for methylone, I have been researching through the forums and feedback for two days now and everyone seems to claim to have the best from the crystals all the way through powder form.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for a 10g-14g order for a decent price of the top quality I can get that will make me comeback quickly if its top notch.&nbsp; Not trying to get ripped off as money is tight and I am trying to pull a double up, so any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.......

				just a piece of advice, dont bother with methylone.&nbsp; &nbsp;if you want to roll, just get real MDMA... for a beginner only 100 or 125 mg and then some 5htp to go to sleep

				I have personally gone thru countless times of rolling off M1....its all good and dandy til your person that has it quits messing with it himself, and then gets a weak weak weak batch that tastes straight toxic.&nbsp; &nbsp;Id personally rather just get MDMA powder or pills off SR.<br /><br />Also M1 is now being cut with butylone.&nbsp; I know nothing about this chemical, therefore another reason why Id rather stick with MDMA.&nbsp; Now as far as MDMA goes, ive read where people are washing their MDMA with acetone to get purity of bliss....Does anyone know about this?

				Yea I took a bad batch myself of M1 myself felt like shit for like two weeks so I do know the risks of dealing with M1.&nbsp; But I my budget is low and I figure the best flip would be M1 then next time grab some MDMA but my only problem with that is I&#039;m not to sure of ordering International yet and ordering MDMA in the states is pretty high so there is not much room for profit.&nbsp; I research the shit out of the forums and feedback sections before I did any ordering so I think im pretty safe with the Vendor I went through to order the M1 he has a 100percent approval rating with over 300 transactions.

				ive been buying methylone for about 7 months now and never have had a bad batch and i buy large amounts, just do your hw on vendors read their page look at their feedback, and rating<br />currently if your looking for an order about that size id definitely go with tigerrush their M1 wont disappoint, and as far as having a bad batch i havent seen it... i like it just fine, idk why people bitch about it, its like molly but a better head high but to me a less body high, still overall good and you cant beat the price and profit margin 8)

				Let me correct that I haven&#039;t had a bad batch from SR I took some locally before and it must have been from a bad batch.&nbsp; All that goes around is crap in my area.&nbsp; I placed my first order today actually with Tigerrush from doing all the research on the forums and checking out the feedback Tigerrush def seems the most legit and liked Vendor for M1 and he was pretty cool in responding back to me with inquiries so just waiting for first order to come thru to check it out.&nbsp; And most def going to get my stats up just as in the street the more rep and loyalty you show the better options and respect you get for sure i&#039;m all about that.
