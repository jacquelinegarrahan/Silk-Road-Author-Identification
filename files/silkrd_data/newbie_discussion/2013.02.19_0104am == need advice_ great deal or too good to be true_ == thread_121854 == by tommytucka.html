				I&#039;d post this elsewhere, but my post count is low so newbies, please help me out?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been pm&#039;ing with someone I connected with through a normal interwebs forum and she says she just got a huge benzo script and doesn&#039;t need them all and wants to work something out. In addition, a friend straight up gave her 90 valiums because for reasons unknown...though the context suggests an opiate for benzo trade. She says she&#039;s in the hospital now for a chronic pain condition, and implied that when she gets out she&#039;d be down to send some of her back stock my way. No money has been discussed yet, and it&#039;s all very vague at this point.<br /><br />I do feel like there is at least some tiiiny level of trust because we started talking to compare etizolam vendors and look for online benzo vendors, and agreed to hook each other up if someone came across a good deal or extra pills. In other words, the original correspondence was not to make any exchanges, but to compare notes, essentially.<br /><br />If she were to offer to send me free pills, is that a GET OUT NOW IT&#039;S A TRAP scenario, or just a friendly person fulfilling a prior agreement? Second of all, is it even illegal to accept a controlled substance w/o any money changing hands? (I&#039;ma google this soon, just wondering if someone knows off the top of their head).<br /><br />If she does want money, then a) how can I get her to prove she&#039;s not a cop?; and b) how can we trust each other to provide the product and the cash? I&#039;m not fronting cash, and she&#039;d be crazy to front the product, but I&#039;d absolutely keep my end of the bargain if she did (assuming I go through with it)<br /><br />Any advice?

				update: just received a message asking for my address and offering free samples. So obviously she&#039;ll want money evenually. She gave me her phone number too, which I&#039;m gonna call soon. <br /><br />Do I give her my address for some free samples? Am I setting myself up here? damn, shit&#039;s complicated off the Road. My brain says no but my...other brain craving a benzo says yes.

				best answer i can think of is if you feel something is too good&nbsp; to be true it is and if you have a gut feeling against go with that feeling bet you will feel better in the end that nothing went wrong on or off the road you dont know who your talking to why not play it as safe as you can and if you are going to go through&nbsp; with it get pills before you give money atleast you wont get screwed out of money unless you give them cash first ,but if they are le they will know you were intending to accept drugs thus be in poss. once you give em the address make your judgement based on how you feel on the inside so you have no regrets

				@sayword<br /><br />word. That&#039;s some great input, man, and echoing my own thoughts. Just talked to the dude on the phone (not a she after all) and he&#039;s offering free samples for starters. I don&#039;t know where things will go from there, but in this case my gut is actually tellin me to go with it. I talked to his twin brother who passed the phone over, and dude&#039;s on some dillys and sooooouuuunded liiiikkkeee it, ya know?<br /><br />He respected my skepticism and paranoia, so I&#039;m thinkin I might go for it. I&#039;ma sit on it for like an hour though first.<br /><br />Thanks<br />-TT

				@leonard washingtoan aka chappell<br /><br />That&#039;s my experience too. I&#039;m just tryin to figure out how he could screw me over if he&#039;s sending free samples first. I&#039;m lookin for a catch, but I aint finding one yet<br /><br />Also, a small free sample set doesn&#039;t seem too good to be true anymore. that&#039;s fairly common, right?

				Sounds sketchy as hell, to be honest.&nbsp; A small free sample isn&#039;t always &quot;too good to be true&quot; but it&#039;s worrisome that you&#039;re making these deals over the phone AND it is somehow connected to SR?<br /><br />I dunno, sounds pretty messy and risky.

				I hear ya scout. Fortunately this is in no way connected to SR, he doesn&#039;t even use SR. I only talked to him over the phone to get a feel for the guy -- no incriminating words, just a &quot;how&#039;s it goin, are you the guy from &#91;]? sorry you&#039;re in the hospital man. hope you feel better.&quot; then further pm&#039;s for the business talk.<br />Like I said before, I&#039;m gonna sit on this for an hour, maybe a day now, and make a decision. I have no reason to trust or distrust this guy, but I&#039;m still gonna err on the side of caution. I asked him for any sort of proof that he is legit, and he said he&#039;s workin on it. So until then, I&#039;m just sittin waitin for my last SR order...by the way, fuck president&#039;s day and national holidays. That&#039;s one more day of waiting lol

				No. Don&#039;t ring the number and whatever you do don&#039;t give your address. Only deal with trustworthy vendors and stick to SilkRoad&#039;s escrow system, if your giving your address to a someone through pm on a forum (clearweb, darkweb, any online forum, it doesn&#039;t matter), they could be &#039;anyone or &#039;anything&#039;. Dealing through pm is a gamble, a big gamble, you may compromise your identity as a result from it, my best advice is don&#039;t do it tommytucker, the risks are more than the deal is worth, always apply commonsense and stay safe :)

				after you get the last order from sr clean out your house and that way if anything goes wrong you can still say you didnt ask for it for all anyone knows and the guy couldve put the wrong address and you got it instead of the actual receiver it will be ok as long as you dont use your real name

You just wish your gut was telling you to go with it. Don&#039;t do it. I have no idea whether this person is legitimate or not, but if they&#039;re not, you will explode your own spleen from kicking yourself so hard.<br /><br />You said yourself you think they will expect money later. You&#039;re sacrificing all the protections of SR for a couple free samples just to then buy it later anyway, still without SR protections. <br /><br />Live your own life of course, but from the information you&#039;ve provided, I can&#039;t think of any scenario to justify the risk, even if you believe that risk to be relatively small. <br /><br />It sounds to be me like biking without a helmet. Could you ride for hundreds of miles without a helmet and be totally fine? Most likely. But one misplaced pebble in the road and you crack your skull open. Are a few free samples really worth it? I&#039;d say pass.<br /><br />Terrible analogies aside, best of luck. Stay safe.<br /><br />edit: A little slow. Oops. <br /><br />

				@ Highprincess<br />@scout<br />I did give him a call -- not from my own phone, but from google voice, so he should think I&#039;m from Escondido, CA. we didn&#039;t mention anything sketchy -- no more than a friend checking up on someone in the hospital. Am I at risk there? And I def didn&#039;t give my address and don&#039;t plan on it. He knows nothing about me aside from my forum avatar. Anything else I can do to protect myself? I mean, there have been no info exchanges so far (aside from his real, my dummy phone #), no agreements to move drugs, nothing except a few pm&#039;s that happen to mention drugs.<br /><br />@sayword<br />my house is spotless, the package should be here by Fri., I&#039;m fully ready to deny. Thanks for the advice.

				Sounds very risky to me.&nbsp; I was very nervous to use SR but after doing a lot of research and finding a good vendor I developed trust in the system.&nbsp; I would stick to SR and listen to the senior members around here (not saying that you don&#039;t already), they have a lot of good advice.

				Had me worried there Tommy. I&#039;m glad you didn&#039;t go for it. Sounded sketchy. Sounds like a slam-dunk case if it was fishy, could have recorded the phone call, got your IP address (if you weren&#039;t using TOR), had your name on the envelope. Glad to hear you bailed. Like many others said, if you even suspect it MIGHT be too good to be true, my experience has shown me 100% of the time that I shouldn&#039;t have done it, and now I find that I get ripped off WAY less!
