				&nbsp;:)tried some of subs 160ug blotters took 1 and a half tabs very nice warm melty feelings not much in the way of visuals except for a bit of classic wavyness i was hoping for something a bit deeper but i had been drinking and i took them when we got back from seeing trailer park boys live in ldn.i think also my tolerance for acid is quite high i think two of these tabs would had been better but had to share with my mates all in all a wicked funny night.we dragged a matress downstairs and me and my missis and my mate and his missis rolled about on it pissing ourselves (felt so good we all nearly ended up fucking) not sure if group sex is my thing though! deff recommend this guy good coms great stealth good product<br /><br />His mdma is also banging!! ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;
