				I&#039;m just curious. I&#039;m 31ish (plus or minus 3 years) I&#039;m not dumb enough to state my age here.<br /><br />There are only 4 common street drugs that I&#039;ve never tried:<br />1. Molly (not even X pills) (sold it; never tried)<br />2. K (not sure how I feel about K holes)<br />3. Heroin (no desire)<br />4. Mescalin<br /><br />And then there are those I&#039;ve tried a few times but not often:<br />4. Shrooms<br />5. LSD<br /><br />Molly and LSD are the one&#039;s I&#039;m asking about. Am I told old to try Molly?<br /><br />AS for LSD, Jesus Christ I love that shit; I&#039;m just afraid it&#039;s too much. That shit never wears off and I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll have a fucked up trip.<br /><br />Bonus:<br />My favorite drugs are:<br />Aderall<br />Weed<br />Alcohlol<br />Xanax (in that order)<br /><br />In that order. Whatcha y&#039;all think? too old?<br /><br /><br />PS Put this in the noob section cause I couldn&#039;t figure out where to post it and most of you need posts anyway&nbsp; :)

				Well if adderall is your favourite drug, and you take it recreationally (30mg+ IR w/o tolerance) Then MDMA should be nothing to worry about. I would be equally as concerned with MDMA as amphetamines as they both strain the heart. For someone that is relatively healthy, and in their early 30s, this is still quite young and most stmulants are generally considered safe to take so long as you don&#039;t abuse them. Have your xanax on hand in case you feel side effects, and have fuN!

				I think 30 is plenty young enough for your brain to still be able to interact with chemicals. There are elderly people still smoking marijuana so it must be doing something for them, I&#039;d say you still have plenty of time to experiment.

				Thank you very much for your answers. Molly I probably could handle (MA in MDMA does stand for methamphetamine). That people tell e it&#039;s like no other drug.<br /><br />As for trippin, I&#039;d love to trip face, but I&#039;m just afraid I&#039;m gonna have a bad trip (which usually means you will.

				I&#039;m 57 and still experimenting. I also love doing LSD. It&#039;s all about the setting you put yourself into and the open mind you have when doing it. Try doing it on a really nice sunny Fall day. Take a couple hour walk through the woods or just hang out in a hammock and marvel at the world we live in. I&#039;ve been tripping since 1969 and can honestly say I have never had a &quot;Bad Trip&quot;. There have been times I was taught stuff I didn&#039;t want to know but all was good in the end.<br />Just kick on back and enjoy

				I only rolled once before I was 30, and then got a taste for it again in my early 30s, and now roll quite often (too often probably) in my mid 30s. I recommend moderation and sensible safety precautions, but you should be fine. Get some good stuff thru the main site and enjoy. Get real MDMA instead of pressed pills of who-knows-what.<br /><br />Stay safe and be smart, you can still enjoy yourself at your age.

I was afraid it might be too intense and that I&#039;d freak out now that I&#039;m old LOL (No, I&#039;m not old --- I&#039;m old to the teenager I used to be though). It&#039;s such a strong head trip. My buddy bet me I couldn&#039;t do it, which is why I asked about that. I&#039;ve already proved him wrong with &#039;shrooms (which I&#039;m not crazy about).<br /><br />I got some awesome replies on this thread. Thanks!<br /><br />

				Here&#039;s a tip- keep a good xanax bar or so for when you eat acid. Try it out taking maybe only a hit, or a hit point five.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep the xanax/two valium blues/ big clonazepam/etc.etc.etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;for when you are tired of tripping, and want to come down.&nbsp; Works like a fucking charm.&nbsp; Benzos seem to directly counteract whatever the classical 5ht2 hallucinogens do (acid, mushrooms) and brings you down so you can sleep very quickly.&nbsp; Also very useful for bringing down a bad trip.

				In my opinion I&#039;d say go for the MDMA get it from a reliable vendor off of here if you would like a few vendors you can message me. When I first tried MDMA I felt like the whole world should try it since that point in time I&#039;ve been using it and distributing it (Yeah yeah I know I just admitted to a Felony on a public . Hopefully one day a movement for MDMA non-criminalization will grow as the amount of people that have tried it grows just as the cannabis movement is currently progressing in the United States. MDMA is a life changing experience for the better just make sure you stay hydrated and do some research before you jump into anything be it MDMA or any other chemical you put into your body.

				Man as a 46 year old-hearing a 31ish person ask if they are too old to try a new drug made me lol at first, then i just kinda wanted to smack you-and i mean that in the nicest possible way lol. But shit dude im with you on the acid thing-ever since i became an adult with kids and real responsibilities-I just couldn&#039;t trip anymore. Coming back to reality was hard enough when i was a teenager, the thought of coming down to my world now? Scares the shit out of me hehe. Anyway, I have a friend that is in his 70&#039;s and still does meth every day-he is a trip. But barring any medical issues-I say you are never too old, just do your research, talk to some smart and helpful peeps in the know-and have a kick ass time!

				Around the same age as OP. I was a straightedge since last year.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m probably a &quot;junkie&quot; by normal people&#039;s standards.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you guys, but I don&#039;t feel any fucking different than say 5 or 10 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;My body has aged but my mind stayed the same.&nbsp; So the only times age should be a concern is for health issues.

But shit dude im with you on the acid thing-ever since i became an adult with kids and real responsibilities-I just couldn&#039;t trip anymore. Coming back to reality was hard enough when i was a teenager, the thought of coming down to my world now? Scares the shit out of me hehe. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah I meant state of mind when I said too old, not physical age. LOL I&#039;m still young and strong as an ox! I say I&#039;m old, because I&#039;m around a lot of teenagers who, in fact, think I&#039;m old and call me sir!<br /><br />I meant like &quot;Am I told old to be all cracked out the day after an acid trip? And the jury&#039;s still out. As for tripping itself, not worried about being too old for that.<br /><br />And meth is a different animal. I regularly use moderate doses of Adderall. You stay clear headed for the most part (Well, OK I do at least).

I have a habit of erring on the side of too much.<br /><br />I took 60 mg of Adderall the first time I tried it LOL! I kept taking more and more and more because I thought I couldn&#039;t feel anything. The problem was, sice I&#039;d never tried it, I had no idea what to expect. I ended up high as a fucking kite! Christ!<br /><br />Same thing with acid: 3 tabs the very first trip. My friends and I kept taking more because we didn&#039;t think we took enough (took a long time to kick in).<br /><br />So I&#039;m cautious with new things, but I appreciate that tip!

				I&#039;m over 40 and have done everything except for PCP and Crack. No desire to try those either :P<br />I&#039;m with you on the bad trip thing, though... I had a couple bad ones on shrooms when I was younger. The thing is, once you&#039;ve had one bad trip, the same bad trip can come back the next time you trip! So, if you&#039;re toying with the idea of acid, but aren&#039;t sure, make sure you have a &#039;tour guide&#039; to help keep things chill. One time my roommate was freaking out, taking like 3 showers in a row, and i finally talked him into riding bikes with me around the block.. That did the trick! Changes of environment are very powerful ways to calm someone (or yourself for that matter) if the trip gets to be too much.<br />Just my .002 btc ;)<br />

				Honestly if you&#039;ve got good health, no blood pressure problems or heart problems you should be good trying any drug.<br />Theyre like rollercoasters so so long as you follow the guidelines and warnings you should be fine.<br /><br /><br />althouuuughhh<br /><br />you must be &#039;THIS&quot; tall to ride<br />mwahahahaha

				You&#039;re never too old for anything in my book.<br /><br />Well, except or pony rides or those spinning rides in front of 99 cent stores and cheap supermarkets....<br /><br />Then that&#039;s just creepy.<br /><br />Especially at 31. I&#039;d recommend trying Molly at a good rock and roll concert (if you like rock), or anything revolving around music. You&#039;ll get really talkative and the atmosphere and music will blow your mind.<br /><br />And if you try heroin, don&#039;t IV it (risk of OD is way higher). And you&#039;d probably be surprised by how heroin feels. I never thought I&#039;d try it either, until I realized it&#039;s the one drug that basically changes your emotions/thoughts, and makes your body feel like it&#039;s floating (however, no euphoria. It&#039;s very dreamlike). <br /><br />So if you&#039;re ever sad, try heroin then. It makes you not care anymore hahaha.
