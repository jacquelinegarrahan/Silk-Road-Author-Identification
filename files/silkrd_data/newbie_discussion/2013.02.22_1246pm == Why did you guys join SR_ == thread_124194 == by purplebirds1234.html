				I like my durgs...<br /><br />Had been using the same dealer IRL for years, almost a decade.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reliable, honest, discreet, consistent, good variety &amp; quality of products, rarely out of stock, and was&nbsp; a short drive away, back streets all the way :) Then over a period of about 6 months that all changed and then they got busted.<br /><br />They managed to avoid a custodial sentence by a whisker, but they&#039;re gonna be busy for a few years to come&nbsp; &#039;working for free in the community performing various services&#039;.&nbsp; They&#039;ll still &#039;help out&#039; a few of us that they&#039;ve known for a long time and can trust, but I dont feel comfortable with it (yeah yeah we&#039;re all adults and we all are responsible for our actions etc, but still, they&#039;re gonna go to jail if they are caught dealing again, or probably if its just a possession quantity, and i dont feel right helping enable that possibility).<br /><br />Was&nbsp; still usually able to arrange something through other people via friends of friends type deal&nbsp; (which as an occasional thing is ok but is generally a hassle for all involved and would wear thin quickly otherwise).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also spent some time getting out and about, meeting new people, making new contacts, who mostly were either only drifters / part timers / unreliable / just plain dodgy, or getting busted and getting out of the business. So fucking time consuming, just to get my high on.<br /><br />Joined SR ~a year ago and havent looked back since.

				I joined because of the variety of options.<br /><br />I have had reliable dealers but not the the extent that I could trust them like I can trust the road. I feel like I can always rely on the road :)<br /><br />Also people from my area&nbsp; may not deal with things such as DMT and real acid is such a rarity now that I wouldn&#039;t trust anybody except vendors here.<br /><br />-Mel

I&#039;ve dealt with the same IRL dealer for a long time without issues but, in the last year, he has gone from being reliable and friendly to shady and difficult. After losing all of the money I&#039;d given him to score for me a SECOND time I was lucky enough to find out about SR. Placing my first order today and, hopefully, will be moving all of my business here from now on. <br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to see why dealers moved to SR and if, after becoming sellers here, they still deal IRL or if SR generates enough business to sustain their operations totally.<br /><br />

				I seen it in an article one day (good thing it was gone the next)researched and here I am. I enjoy partaking. I like similar stories have had the same dealer. However this is actually cheaper as far as quality goes for I am interested in. <br /><br />That being said I have not made a buy yet or anything. Not sure how the coins work. I guess I am to use my external and put something on there and boot my pc from it. then get my receipt from bitinstant go to whoremart where I am at and get my coins. I just do not get the whole moving them from mtgox to sr, and moving it 20 times in a wallet prior. If any of you read this and were or are in a situation as I am please assist.<br /><br />I have only been here 3 days. Drooling uncontrolably. lol. I wanna do it right though. I have the guide that&#039;s posted just waiting on that flash drive. Pointers help.<br />

				I&#039;ve been around the RC vending community for years.&nbsp; As soon as I heard about SR I made it my mission to get a sellers around there as soon as I could.&nbsp; It would be the best market for me and I wouldn&#039;t be so limited I had been selling band rcs to many long term customers for a long time.&nbsp; Silk road I knew I could expand in more direction.&nbsp; I saw it a place a smart guy who&#039;s thought about things and has a solid plan could make a career here were he could retire at 50.&nbsp; As I looked into tor and dark net these where the places that could be done.&nbsp; I started building my empire with 200$ and a good connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got the product and started selling it on various open forums.&nbsp; &nbsp; At first new and dumb, but learning quickly.&nbsp; As an IRC hangaround with large players in the scene for years I was able to start off with a huge helper.&nbsp; I was turned onto a very good lab by another guy. Anyway it took awhile and mistakes where made I continued to get better and smarter.&nbsp; The change in my shipping over time is crazy using click and print in the early days to my ninja like post off dealings today.&nbsp; In, out your at the post office more then most people but I limit my interaction with them as little as possible.&nbsp; Buy all my postage with an card that doesn&#039;t track back to me.&nbsp; I always arrive at the post office with all things 100%, stamped and ready to go.&nbsp; This include express.&nbsp; I don&#039;t print my express or I don&#039;t stand in line but mail them all the time.&nbsp; I remember the days I mailed from my home address, then using a po box that could be traced back to me, to where today we always use the real return address of some small local generic sounding company and change it all the time.&nbsp; For awhile I got real good at false backed envelopes and that wasn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; Then one day I realized its far better to hide in plain site.&nbsp; My packing/Stealth is always rated high. I got busy as a vendor and am now trying to get needed posts to be active on boards.

				There are a few drugs I&#039;d like to try at least once in my life but I have no safe way of getting them. I&#039;ve ordered from international online pharmacies before, so this isn&#039;t so different. Biggest difference is codeine isn&#039;t the strongest drug here.

				i live in Romania, which as many of you may know, is the asshole of Europe. Drugs here are hard to get and ridiculously expensive. Weed dealers are on basically every corner here, but they are mostly greedy shitheads so it&#039;s difficult to find anyone reliable. Today you might get some quality shit for $20 a gram, but next week he might sell you crap for the same price and even give you less than what you paid for. Getting anything other than weed and shitty ecstasy pills is usually out of the question, it is hard and will leave you broke (I tried to buy LSD the guy offered me one blotter, supposedly 100 micg for $50). So yeah, SR is heaven for me, especially as it does not seem to be popular here, it&#039;s a good chance cops know little about it, or they don&#039;t give a shit.

You can do your drugs, and I am not here to preach but things are so extremely easily accessible don&#039;t mess up your life again. I buy so much molly now its unreal, but I have slowed down.

I&#039;m not worried about becoming an addict, I&#039;ve always been able to control myself that way. The out of control part was friends in gangs, having guns pulled on me, that was what I wanted to get rid of, and now thise elements are out of my life. The drugs I can handle. I order small, gram or couple pills at a time.

				The one thing that I dislike about the SilkROad is if I am sitting around and decide &quot;damn I want to do some acid tommorrow&quot; its to late you get it. But I&#039;m still not going to call up a street dealer anymore because I have already experienced high quality drugs. <br />A friend of mine told me he hated molly because it makes him angry, tired and violent. I said &quot;motherfucker you were&#039;t on molly&quot; and he swears he was and there is no talking him out of it, but I love the quality control of the SilkRoad.

				It&#039;s the best way for anybody who is smart enough to get whatever they want for one set price. Not only would it keep quality drugs in the area but it also works to sort of stabilize the street prices to some extent.

				I joined sr as I need anonymity in my job and community and I would never be able to find the high grade products I find on sr here locally. As by the time I get it off some street punk it has been stepped on so much I see footprints, whereas even the shitty stuff on sr is still 10x better than anything I could get myself. sr cuts out all those little middlemen who all take their turns of adding cut. So for me sr quality and anonymity are why I keep coming back but I only deal domestically to reduce customs heat.

				I joined to sell shrooms, but they raised the price to 500 bucks and can&#039;t afford that, so I had to go to another site. I don&#039;t grow shrooms, I hunt, and the best ones you gotta hunt and you can&#039;t grow so it&#039;s not a large enough scale to pay that much. Anyway, that&#039;s rather specialized i admit, since most of the drugs out there can be grown or made in a lab..But not this, see sig
