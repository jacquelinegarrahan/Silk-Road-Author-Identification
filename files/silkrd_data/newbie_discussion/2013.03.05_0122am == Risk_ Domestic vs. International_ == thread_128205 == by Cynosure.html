				I&#039;m somewhere in the United States.<br /><br />There is a seller (seller#1) who has a product of 10g for $323 in Germany.&nbsp; There is a seller (seller#2), in the United States, who is selling seller#1&#039;s product; you can get 5g for $323.&nbsp; Essentially, you&#039;re getting half the product for the same price by ordering in-country.&nbsp; <br /><br />How large is the risk of a package overseas not making it here?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d, obviously, rather get 10g for the same price.. but, I&#039;d also rather have something to show for my cash in the end rather than a &quot;lost package&quot;.<br /><br />What would you more experienced folks do?

				I rarely order domestic packages and would rather take risk from international to save money. Just avoid high risk countries like Netherlands and buy from Canada, UK, and Germany. Lastly, NEVER FE :)

				To consider:<br /><br />- on interception, would you be burning your real name, real address? (if yes, strong factor in favour of domestic)<br />- country of origin - Germany - not bad AFAIK - could be worse (eg: the Netherlands)<br />- country of destination - U.S.. a generally suspicious lot, but could be worse (eg: Australia)<br />- type of product. I&#039;d be content to order tabs from overseas if reports of stealth were good. Powder and pills, less so depending on vendor feedback. Weed, no. <br /><br />I&#039;m not you, so I can&#039;t weigh these for you, but these are the factors I&#039;d consider.<br /><br />

				I have had several transactions go well here in US with US sellers, only one standout being Chembros. I have yet to have a good transaction with an overseas buyer, though technically I am still within the window (or so I am told) of delivery times from EU. I would say to stay in the US and play it safe....get your product in a couple of days instead of weeks/never. I hope these guys prove me wrong and if so I will update.

				I would say stay within the US. I&#039;ve done both. The shipping time is murder. In my experience it&#039;s been nearly a month each time - which is nerve racking. Then there&#039;s the issue of customs burning your home address and name. The chances of getting burned domestically are very slim and usually only happens with weed or with a terrible vendor (you can rule that out with feedback - specifically comments about stealth).<br /><br />But, in my opinion, the biggest factor is the spirit of this issue: we need to support domestic vendors where possible so that prices/products/services will improve domestically. If we support international vendors, we will keep having the same issues. But the more domestic items we buy, the better the supply will become domestically. <br /><br />
