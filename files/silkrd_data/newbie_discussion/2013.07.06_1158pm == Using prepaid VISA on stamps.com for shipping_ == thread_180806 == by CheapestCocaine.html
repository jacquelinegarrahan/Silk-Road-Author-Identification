				Getting a prepaid gift card and signing up for stamps.com on tor.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this regarding safety/security/risk?<br /><br /><br />Also, any tips on how to carry out bulk shipments(to multiple people, not large orders)?? I was thinking putting a bunch of packages in one of the blue drop off USPS boxes, but would that raise any flags having many identical packages in one bluebox??

				I don&#039;t know about the stamps thing but as for the blue boxes:<br /><br />1. Drop them off at various blue boxes<br />2. Drop in the same box but perhaps package them differently<br />3. Package them the same and drop in the same box but use business return address. It is completely normal for a business that ships things out to drop off several packages at once.

				Is it possible to sign up for Stamps.com on TOR? Many sites are not TOR friendly &amp; even if you manage to sign up I imagine that account could be flagged. If you&#039;re using an anonymous laptop just take that to a place w/ free wifi, boot it up normally, and sign up there. (Hard to argue w/ the a free digital scale they hand out&nbsp; ;D ). <br /><br />Treadlight has the right idea. It depends on your shipping strategy &amp; what your parcels look like &amp; how many you&#039;re sending etc. Be careful about dropping identical packages in different blue boxes, tho - the same postie might be picking them up &amp; you don&#039;t want him to start wondering why someone would bother driving around the city to drop off their mail when they could just as easily use one box. If a blue box rarely gets parcels but then all of a sudden there&#039;s a dozen from apparently different people that might look weird too. Ironically when it comes to shipping it&#039;s often the stuff people do to disguise themselves that gets packages flagged. :)<br /><br />Tip: Be careful but don&#039;t overthink it - if you pretend you&#039;re a legitimate business or someone selling mail order products out of their home you&#039;ll blend in better. Do a little eBay &amp; (used) Amazon shopping to see what&#039;s normal, or start buying stamps at the post office so you can see the sort of packages that other people drop off. imo the shipping strategy you end up w/ should be customized to your sales volume &amp; location &amp; the size of your orders &amp; any number of other details that you might not want others knowing, so tho the forums can help with some questions the details need to be up to you.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
