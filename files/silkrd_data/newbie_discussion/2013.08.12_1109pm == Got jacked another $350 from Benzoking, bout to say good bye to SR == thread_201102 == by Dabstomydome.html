				Hey everyone,<br />Having a really shitty day. I usually get my coins through Bankobits but i couldnt get a hold of him yesterday so i saw Benzoking had an ad for bitcoins. He had perfect reviews and feedback so i thought id give him a chance. He was super quick to answer all my messages and everything seemed fine. I sent him the moneypak with $350 on it and then all of a sudden i hear nothing from him. I ask him whats up lsat night and he says can i give you a refund. I asked him why and he hasnt replied since. Hasnt replied to my other questions and now his vendor page is just gone. This is the second time i randomly chose a reputable vendor and they just ran off with my money. 450 with thetopshelf and now 350 with Benzoking. Its like what are the chances that these people are decent vendors to everyone else and then the one time i order i get jacked. Besides that, both orders i put in the last two weeks for herb and wax went 7 days without being put into transit so i had to cancel them both. Is it that much to ask that you cant send a package out in a week? Thurgood and Marthastewart both did that to me(although thurgood claims he is sending me my 1/8 still). Anyways i love silk road and i thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread but after the last few weeks, i think im about to say fuck it. I cant take getting jacked hundreds of dollars all the time, i didnt even FE this time and i got jacked. I guess it is stupid to send some random guy a moneypak with that much money, but when you see hundreds of other people do it, it is hard not to.

				Just use virwox (wirvox?)x. It eliminates the chance of a scam. Plus they take credit cards. They take shitty fees, something like 5-8% in total.

				i only know of bitinstant(which is down) and coinbase to get coins from other than from vendors on SR. coinbase is straight but i dont like how my bank account is linked to buying bitcoins and that they put a four day hold on it before you can get your coins. i know coins are legal but it is just another reason to get yourself fucked if there was ever any investigation to you and SR if you have them tied to your bank account. it seems the more annonymous you are(moneypak, reloadit cards, sending money in the mail) the riskier, but if you choose a website(coinbase,virwox,bitinstant) you cant be as annoymous although it is much more secure.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey mate, sorry to hear you got ripped off by that vendor, and that your experience in general on the Road hasn&#039;t been so great that sucks&nbsp; :( This really is an awesome place, but it&#039;s increasingly becoming difficult for new users to settle in without being targeted by shit heels.<br /><br />&nbsp; You should definitely take any scammy orders to resolution, or at the least message SR Support with your concerns. They will act on vendors who are damaging the Road&#039;s reputation as the safest place to buy high quality drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I suggest looking into localbitcoins.com. I don&#039;t know what country you&#039;re from, guessing the States, but they have a number of options for buying coin pretty much anonymously for people all around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Good luck! Hope you stick with it. Like you said, it&#039;s a fucking cool phenomenon to be a part of, Hitch

				You&#039;ve had some bad luck. But the SR management doesn&#039;t recommend buying btc from vendors. They give this advice as a friendly warning. <br /><br />I used localbitcoins.com. It has an escrow feature and there is a choice of sellers and methods available.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let the bastards grind you down..<br /><br />

				^Like he said, Ive never had a single issue at localbitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp; just look for ppl online if you want fast communication, then look for ppl with only 100% and you will get your coins. at least in my case. If you need em fast alot of ppl accept westernunion.com if you can be patient, money in the mail got me the best deal~

				thanks everyone, i have met some really awesome people on here. it just sucks that a couple d-bags have to ruin everything. part of me wants to say fuck it to this site and just only deal with herb in real life, and part of me wants to pick up a ounce of wax and hustle that shit to get my money back. it is so hard to not want to reup when people around here pay 100g for wax and i can get it on here for 30-40. if only getting bitcoins wasnt such a pain in the ass.
