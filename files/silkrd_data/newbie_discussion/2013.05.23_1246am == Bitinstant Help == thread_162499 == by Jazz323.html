				Has this happened to anyone. Trying to buy bitcoins with them and I keep getting this message..<br /><br />There was an identity error in generating your payment slip. Please contact support@zipzapinc.com to resolve.<br /><br />I emailed their support and they keep asking me for an account number. I dont have an account number, because bitinstant never printed or generated a slip for me. Been going back and forth with cusomer support, and they are absolutely no help..

				Have you tried using a different name and email?<br /><br />Which bitinstant service are you using?&nbsp; -- BTC to email? BTC to BTC address? BTC to bitstamp?

				Thanks for the tutorial, Ill take a look, but I honestly dont need it. Ive used bitinstant before, without any issues. I dont understand why its not working. I even tried from a different computer. I did get to the last page to generate my slip, but the page keeps refreshing now for some reason..This is just silly now, Im not an idiot when it comes to following directions. <br /><br />Thanks for the replies..

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
