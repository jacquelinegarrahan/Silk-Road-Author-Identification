				There are a number of ways (it all depends on what country you are in, US seems to be the hardest to obtain them at the moment):<br /><br />Go to &quot;Services&quot; on the main SR page and there are several listed there.&nbsp; Ask some vendors there and you can probably find one that will help.&nbsp; Good luck!<br />

				I&#039;ve just started my sr journey as well. I found a really professional,courteous guy on ebay. Started with a small purchase as was a bit nervous about getting turned over. The whole process took about two hours. He helped me with getting a wallet, what to do etc. Have a search for bitcoin btc. Look for paul. His listings were massively helpful and was a very secure transaction. Hope this helps

				Depends a bit how busy you are getting your coins and where you are located. <br />The cheapest option is usually to get an account at one of the exchanges (Bitstamp, Mt. Gox or similar), provide the proper validation they need to keep their back free from money-laundering charges (like proof of identity and proof of residence), wait out the whole tedious process, send money there by wire-transfer or SEPA, buy the coins at current market price and transfer them to the wallet you prefer. <br />Often, you can find a local vendor selling coins from day to day at a significant markup (often 8-10%), but it&#039;s easy and convenient. You can also try to see if https://localbitcoins.com/ works out for you.
