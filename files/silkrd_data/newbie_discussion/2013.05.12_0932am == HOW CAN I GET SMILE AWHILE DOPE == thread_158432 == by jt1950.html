				Anyone have any info on this? Is he still around in stealth or did the choads chase him off completely? Will he be unstealthing at any point for folks that would love to try his gear but didn&#039;t have the scratch while he was active?

				I did my research also and Smile Awhile seemed to be the man with the best dope.&nbsp; I wrote him and he replied.&nbsp; He told me that he was no longer a vendor and won&#039;t be vending.&nbsp; Why I don&#039;t know.
