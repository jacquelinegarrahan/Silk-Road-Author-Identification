				This is a perfect example of what not to do.<br /><br />Sorry Quicksort but first of all, you were not fooled into FE. TabMonster states that FE is required. Secondly, this is why there are a billion warnings about FE. FE can be risky and you accept the dangers.<br /><br />Third, this emphasizes the importance of searching the forums for reviews before making purchases. For example, the LSD Avengers have TabMonster under the bad vendor list found here -&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />There are posts claiming, non-delivery or random cancellation.<br /><br />Do your research and understand the risks.<br /><br />I will gladly accept Bitcoins for absolutely no reason - 12ENeAv92wquhrK8kERicC9gW4QqnU7AuM

				I would think of this site like any online store. Would you buy from someone on ebay if their post looked sketchy or if they asked to deviate from the norm of the site? Escrow is the backbone that makes any kind of online &quot;black&quot; market purchases seem even remotley a good idea. I would also say to never play with money you are not comfortable setting on fire , because in essence that is what your doing when you FE. I would say patience is your friend. If you dont see what you want , wait a week or two. Or send a pm to a few sellers with high ratings that have other products. Chances are you can find what you are looking for if you just use some common sense and dont jump the gun.

				I wanted to thank Tabmonster for being a scammer...I placed my first ever order on SR with him for his Czech Needlepoint. Luckily I did not have to FE. He canceled my order after two days without even PM&#039;ng me why. Thats why I want to thank them, cause I was able to take the returned bitcoins and get real LSD Blotters from Tessellated that were the Bomb!!!&nbsp; It sucks they(Tabmonster) are ripping people off...looks like a good vendor gone bad...maybe using to much of their own product!!

				Ok guys that ask for btcs to a btc address rather than a SR user name more than likely have multiple forum usernames and one sr user account and just just the same marketplace account to generate new addresses to double and triple the chances of getting free btcs from random kind hearted members. If someone wont post their username for the instant transaction of btcs then they more than likely don&#039;t actually need the btc and are trying to scrape together btcs for next weeks drugs.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				I ordered from TabMonster in early January... it was marked in transit the next morning, but it&#039;s been almost 3 weeks and I never received it. I FE&#039;d because he had good ratings and the early reviews (before he required FE) were great. Very disappointed... I&#039;d wanted to take it with a friend over winter break... we&#039;ll have to wait until spring now! It was my first ever order, so I was upset, but I&#039;ve ordered a couple more things from other sellers since then and they got to me fine. There&#039;s always a risk.

				That sucks but it&#039;s pretty easy to do your research and never FE. Hopefully it won&#039;t happen again, there are plenty of great vendors on the road so don&#039;t be too discouraged.

				Never, ever FE man. Its just not worth it. If they have a &quot;limit&quot; for noobs, find guys who are open to new buyers (there are lots out there) and build up your transactions. FEing is just not worth the risk.

				TabMonster&#039;s feedback was obviously faked.&nbsp; I called him a potential scammer in many threads around here before people even started getting scammed.<br /><br />Bottom line - don&#039;t FE unless you are convinced the vendor is legit.&nbsp; Pages and pages of nothing but FE doesn&#039;t add up.

				Never FE if you haven&#039;t ordered at least 5 times with the vendor and you have absolute trust in him.<br />Also always check the forums before you ship that&#039;s what i always do.
