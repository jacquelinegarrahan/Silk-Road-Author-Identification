				Nice! A vendor who actually cares about his new/old clients enough to post this in the newbies section.That,tells a lot about MERC.(GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!)I have been dealing with him for sometime now..and i only have good things to say about this vendor.After reading about the reviews in his main thread about products not showing up and all.I confidently can say this guy IS 100% LEGIT! Sure,he is slow in his shipping,but he delivers within the stated timeframe! <br /><br />Sometimes we have to take the demographics in action.eg..holidays,summer vacations,slow postal service.especially the heatwave in europe thats going on right now,everyones taking a break man!Of course,ordering drugs of the internet makes us paranoid as fuck! Especially,when its from nederlands or wherever hes shipping from.He does answers everyones paranoid questions,including mine =)<br /><br />So,to sum it up,be patient fellow roaders.mercury31 is the man for high quality products.Especially his coke!..mamamia!The best in SR!<br /><br />Stay Safe<br />bp

				Thx for opening this Thread!Great Service!Ordered on 16.07 today is 24.7 still nothing arrived. This are 8 days DOMESTIC now.Mercury ansered my messages yesterday and told me my order was shipped on friday.this i read also in the forum,that orders of last week are were delayed,but now shipped. I hope to receive my package soon,but if you really would have shipped it on friday it would be here it think.all my domestic orders take 24-48h normaly but not 8 days.what about u others? did u receive your orders of last week?sorry for my bad english...

				Thanks Mercury. This seems like a nice move of you. <br /><br />I am in the same situation as frankymachine and some more in this thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41848.480 .<br /><br />whats the problem. If you are too busy/holiday/out of stock/whatever to send out it would be ok for me and probably others, if you just said so instead of saying you sent it and having us wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				hey guys, i&#039;m in the same boat. ordered some weed and hash on the 17th and still waiting. knowing that i&#039;m not all alone with this took most of my worries away. the only thing that bugs me is that i ran out of weed and i have been smoking on a daily basis for a long time...<br />i already communicated with mercury, and i&#039;m quite satisfied, he always answered quickly and is very friendly. this is definitely a big plus. many other vendors on sr don&#039;t even read messages. i feel that he cares about his customers and it&#039;s nice of him to open a thread everyone can post in.<br />according to him, every order from last week was shipped on friday. he didn&#039;t respond to this but there seems to be a problem with insufficient postage on some packages, and i think that&#039;s why our orders are delayed. we probably have to get it from the post office and pay the rest of the postage. i know that sucks quite a lot, but you have to keep in mind that most of AH&#039;s and PF&#039;s customers switched to mercury after the bust, and that he as a single person is just not capable of dealing with &gt;100 orders and several 100 messages per day. he is just running behind schedule a bit, and some things got confused...<br />i&#039;m sure our orders are on their way, and if nothing arrives mercury will make up for it in a satisfying way. i don&#039;t think he&#039;s a scammer, just too busy at the moment.<br />let&#039;s hope for tomorrow, cheers everyone :)

				i received nothing today as well... <br /><br />i have a new theory but i don&#039;t know if i&#039;m right with this. does mercury use return addresses? if so, it is possible that the post sent the packages with insufficient postage &quot;back&quot; to the return address. this could lead to some big trouble for us customers... :o<br /><br />update: there seems to be no return address on it

				Hi Mercury31, Hi other posters.<br /><br />I have a similar case but with the only difference that I received an envelope that was empty. Just the address was on a page. That&#039;s it.<br />I ordered on the 20th two products. The first one was marked on 20th as &quot;in transit&quot;. The second one on 21st. On 24th I received a letter with nothing in, as stated. Nothing more today, no shipping.<br /><br />Mercury, I wrote to you immediately yesterday and so far I didn&#039;t get a reply. My message is marked &quot;unread&quot;. From your user page I can obtain that you were online today. So you must have seen your new messages! Why didn&#039;t you read it?<br /><br />So, what&#039;s going on? Why shipping an empty envelope? And if the 2 orders have been shipped individually, where is the second shipping?? The envelope was closed, no damage at all. So, nobody could have taken the content. Also I know exactly that this envelope must come from you, Mercury.<br /><br />So please be so kind and get in contact with me to clarify. I know I have no ratings by now since this is my first transaction. But I am not scamming you. So, please reply to my message.

				@bujlsfi:<br /><br /><br />I somehow didn&#039;t read your post before. On my empty shipping there was no return address. <br /><br />If Mercury is superbusy it can be the explanation for the empty envelope. Maybe in the confusion you forgot to put something inside, Mercury?<br /><br />But anyway, please reply to this matter.<br /><br />Thanks

				I placed my order last week and was told by Mercury that my order would be shipped on Monday (domestic). Its highly unlikely that domestic mail really takes this long, there is definitely a delay on the vendors side.

				I guess I should take this opportunity to mine some messages on the board.<br /><br />It seems that Mercury is showing somewhat uneven and unpredictable service at this time.<br /><br />But to get an overall picture you also have to consider the quality of the product, the stealth, the vibes from his emails. <br /><br />All other things being equal, if service continues to be sketchy, he will start to lose regular business to other vendors. Unless he intends to market to the newbies such as myself and not worry about keeping repeat customers.<br /><br />Personally, if I was a vendor, and started a thread like this, I would be monitoring the chatter and being more responsive to my customers. <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;... 8)<br /><br />

				Hey, guys.<br /><br />I told you about the empty shipping. <br /><br />Today, I received everything. Man, that&#039;s the weirdest thing with this empty envelope! Anyway, he offered me yesterday. It&#039;s true that mercury has good communications.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the stamp the mark was from yesterday, so it definitely took quite long (5 work days). But that was not in his power. <br /><br />So, just wait for your orders. I guess everything is hectic at the moment.<br /><br /><br />greetz<br /><br />

				Well, these posts have definitely got me bummed...<br /><br />I&#039;m brand new to SR (only one completed transaction so far with GreenOvenDoor, who&#039;s awesome btw, got my order in less than 72hrs) -- read some awesome reviews about Mercury&#039;s Party Pack, so I ordered on July 12th. I was prepared for it to take awhile since it&#039;s an international shipment (I&#039;m in the southern United States) but I&#039;ve never had any problems getting my packages from international orders before through other websites, so I went ahead and ordered anyway especially because his vendor page states his U.S. packages normally arrive between 5-12 business days. <br /><br />Got a message from him after he marked it in transit on the 14th saying it would be shipped out within the next 3 days. I thought, cool, no big deal. Then I saw on his other review forum (the non-newbie one) that all orders from last week got sent out on the 19th. Asked him what&#039;s up because my order was already close to hitting auto-finalization cut-off AND I&#039;m now currently moving away from the address I&#039;m getting the package sent to -- I&#039;ll be gone by the 5th, so I definitely needed to know when it actually shipped out. He said he indeed shipped on Friday. Still no big deal, I thought, if that&#039;s the case - should definitely receive it by the 5th if his vendor page is correct about the 5-12 days to the U.S. Order is already in SR Resolution to get an extended due date since I definitely didn&#039;t want an auto-finalize on my new account.. all seems well.<br /><br />Until I start reading about all these domestic orders being super, super late.&nbsp; :-\ Now I&#039;m a bit worried. Mercury seems awesome to me; he&#039;s stayed in contact with me and always been prompt with his responses. He&#039;s reassured me that if it doesn&#039;t arrive before the extended due date passes to let him know and he&#039;ll do a reship to my new address. If it was actually sent out on the 19th, that&#039;s definitely cutting it close for me. The 5th will be 14 business days later after the actual ship date... 24 days after I clicked &quot;order&quot; and 22 days after it being marked &quot;in transit&quot;.. crossing my fingers it arrives before then and that the new tenants don&#039;t end up being the ones to receive my party pack&nbsp; ;) but you guys have got me all paranoid.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Damn. This ended up being stupid long. Sorry, guys - I hope everybody gets their shipments ASAP and is enjoying Mercury&#039;s product soon. <br /><br />-lauren<br /><br />

				Hi I´d like to chime in here<br />I ordered on the 17th of July and a second order on the 22nd&nbsp; DOMESTIC<br />Both have not arrived. I also got the message from Merc that all orders have been send out.<br />Im a bit relieved that i am not alone with waiting, but it seems weird. I presume having multiple<br />people involved in the process there is a delay in some instance. That would explain that one person would mark it as shipped but<br />not really sent out while the following process is delayed somehow nut marked in transit.<br />Is there only domestic orders affected??<br />@ whereismyorder - please let us know when you have received anything

				@engineered -- International orders are definitely affected by whatever is going on with Mercury too... I ordered on July 12th and still haven&#039;t received anything. Merc&#039;s vendor page says U.S. orders normally arrive within 5-12 business days.&nbsp; :-\ My order is in SR Resolution - they just extended my auto-finalization due date to August 8th. I ordered the 12th, marked in transit the 14th.. Merc says he shipped it the 19th.. guess we&#039;ll see. These domestic orders taking 2wks+ is showing me that my international order is probably not going to arrive at all. Got my fingers crossed though. <br />I will say that Merc has been awesome as far as responding to my messages. So, let&#039;s hope he just had some shipping delays and we&#039;ll all be hugging our mailmen soon enough.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />-lauren

				Hey Guys, hey Mercury ! <br /><br />I still have the same Problem like the lot of other customers here.<br />But first i have to say that i know Mercury as a loyal Guy and professional Vendor.<br />I know him from the old time as he shipped from Netherlands,every Order needs<br />exactly 3 days to arrive in Germany. In the past my Orders was EVER overweight.<br /><br />BUT i ordered on Friday 26.7.2013 for first time as he shipped from Germany.<br />I was so fucking happy to read that he ship now from domestic and placed directly<br />3 Orders after that. 1g ROCK of MDMA, 2g ROCK of Mercurys Famous Uncut Flake,<br />and to the last 5g of his very nice Amnesia Haze (as i can read from other customers).<br /><br />On Friday he said it will be shipped on Monday (29.7.2013). Today we have Wednesday<br />the 31.7 and still nothing arrived in domestic... Dont have the time for resolution so i <br />send a PM to him and hope that i will get an answer. If he cant ship some products its<br />okay but then i will have my FULL money without some few weeks in resolution center...<br /><br />I HAD A FUCKING PROBLEM IF ITS NOT ARRIVE BECAUSE I GO INTO HOLIDAYS ON 8.8.2013 -.-<br /><br />Mercury whats goin on now. Please tell us ! Good Luck for all Customers from Mercury :)

				Hi all,<br /><br />my order still did not show today. Was sent out supposedly on Monday. I went to resolution center to get more days until auto finalize. This is really frustrating. At least other Vendors were reliable and i received plan b orders in 1 to 2 days.<br /><br />Whats the deal!? Hope everything arrives soon. <br /><br />BTW i am also whereismyorder.

				Looks like the shipping delays are more widespread than I thought...&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Just some background/update on mine: Ordered on the 12th, &quot;in transit&quot; on the 14th (he sent a msg saying he would ship within 3 days), supposedly shipped out on the 19th... Order is already in SR resolution to avoid auto-finalization.. SR extended my due date until the 8th. I&#039;m in the U.S. and have received other international orders placed AFTER the 12th with zero problems, so I&#039;m definitely becoming concerned here - especially since I&#039;m in the process of moving away from the address I&#039;m getting it shipped to (gone on the 5th.)<br /><br />Just sent him a msg asking him to confirm that he indeed shipped on the 19th - I&#039;ll let you guys know if he responds. <br /><br />I&#039;m really hoping we all get our orders sooner rather than later... This is becoming one huge bummer.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />-lauren

				Hey Guys,<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />what u think about my Theory ? Mercury shipped from Netherlands before !<br />I ordered a few times from him in the past. This explain why he still delivers<br />the Dutch Quality, - THE AMNESIA HAZE IS THE BEST EXAMPLE (Dutch Coffeeshop Quality)<br />or the very well Produced MDMA...<br /><br /><br />---&gt; In his Profile u can read NOW that its possible to ship from Germany or Belgium !<br /><br /><br />If he ship from Germany, how he can ship from Belgium too ?!<br />And i am sure actually he just drives to Germany for shipping-<br />or has anybody received from Belgium ? NO ? Thats right - <br />he cant drive to 2 Country´s at the same time :D<br /><br />Actually i think that he does like other Vendors ( Pfandleiher Reloaded for example)<br />and drive the Packages/Orders over the Border from Netherlands to ship it from <br />Germany. Because he cant drive all 30minutes he wait for enough orders and the<br />process needs longer... just a theory.. but fuck it, what should i do if i dont get informations...<br /><br />But this Method with the Border is the biggest Bullshit ... this can explain why he dont tell us<br />the truth about the shipping. I am fucking sure that this is the Problem !!!<br />Because its a high risk (police can catch the driver including our Orders and Adresses) !!!!<br /><br />I think we all know that NETHERLANDS are a Red Flagged Country - this is why he ship from<br />Germany or Belgium now - and remember on my Words if you look on a WORLD/EUROPE MAP.<br />Germany and Belgium are directly near Netherlands. If he drive Packages over the Boarder<br />and ship from there it can be needs 2 days in domestic too because its far away like NL.<br /><br /><br />And if you Ordered from Domestic (GERMANY) and you take those 2 days + round about 3 days<br />as a shipping period (i think he wait for enough orders and drive maybe all 3 days over the Boarder)-<br />sometimes it needs maybe 5 days if he drives again... this is the delay !<br />i get as result those 5-10 days that domestic orders has needed at the most Customers&nbsp; !<br /><br />A Statement from Mercury would be nice, but i think he dont give it because he is scared to<br />lost a lot of customers if they hear this ! ...&nbsp; But i still have Hope for my Order till Friday ...<br /><br />I am sure Mercury never will give a STATEMENT to the words i have said ! <br /><br />GUYS WHAT U ARE THINK ABOUT IT ??? <br />

				@WeedDeluxxe. Thats an interesting theory which sounds lika damn plausible explanation for the shipping delays, But the IMHO I dont care if he does that as long as my order isnt shipped from netherlands(red flag) then its irrelevant to me HOW he ships from germany as long as he does indeed ship from there and I ACTUALLY get my order.<br /><br />Iv been waiting for some time myself now almost two weeks (marked in transit 07/18) <br />He has been pretty quick to reply and friendly, said he&#039;d reship if it doesnt come soon but Im unsure about this whole situation now<br />Havent put it in the resolution center yet (4 dys left) Whens should I put it in there?

				@WeedDeluxxe - I think your theory is dead on as far as him waiting for enough orders to make the drive worth it. When he messaged me on the 14th after he marked mine &quot;in transit&quot; saying it would ship in 3 days, I ended up checking his other review forum a few days later, and he told everyone that he hadn&#039;t got any orders made that week shipped out until Fri the 19th. Pretty sure he did just what you said -- waited until he had enough orders to make it worth his while to make the drive. Still, I couldn&#039;t give a shit as long as he actually ships... it would be nice to have known in advance that shipping may be seriously delayed, though.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />@metabolicman I would go ahead and put it in resolution. I took mine to resolution pretty early on once it was clear there was no way my package was going to arrive before the auto-finalize date. As of right now, all I asked for was an extension on the auto-finalization due date. Mercury accepted my request and SR made the new due date August 8th. Since I placed the order on July 12th, it&#039;d sure be nice to get it waaay before the 8th, though.&nbsp; ::) I would go ahead and make a request in the resolution center for either an extension or a refund/reship, whichever you&#039;d prefer. Then Mercury has to either accept/deny and if he denies, SR will step in to make the final decision. Better to go ahead and make your situation and all the details known to SR asap. <br /><br />Hope we all get something awesome in our mailboxes soon... this waiting game is never fun.&nbsp; :-\<br />-lauren

From my 5 experiences: 1. order was successfully delivered (from Mercury), 2. and 3. (from other top vendors) didn&#039;t arrive, 4. order (Sukey) and 5. (JendaBenda) were perfect.<br /><br />Nevertheless I know some people, who had it oppositely. It&#039;s much more difficult to sell on SR, where You try not to keep tracks, than in usual eshop, where You have perfect control and documentation of everything. Vendors could lost the address, they could forget or get confused (in that number of offers), they could get scared to send it and start suspect buyer, etc. etc.

I have to say after his statement i am<br />sure that MY Boarder Theory are right as i said it :) 100% !!! ...<br /><br />EDIT: The Postman can ? No, he cant because i am sure till now my order was not sipped-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hope that i can trust Mercury that he ship it tomorrow...<br /><br />Cheers !

				Got a reply from Mercury. Also sent a resolution in early just because of how long its taking everyone&#039;s to arrive. He has good communication and i hope to see a product come in. Really trying to give this guy a chance.

				hey everyone,<br />i&#039;ve got basically the same problem as you all.<br />i ordered (domestic germany-&gt;germany) from mercury on july 18th and it was marked as &quot;in transit&quot; on july 20th. after ten days (30.06) without getting anything i wrote mercury to ask about my order.<br />he told me that it was shipped on july 26th,but till today nothing has ever arrived. when i asked him about my missing order, he suggested reshipping.<br />i&#039;m giving him till 06.08. (because i don&#039;t want my order to get &quot;auto-finalized&quot;) if nothing arrives till then,i am expecting a 100% refund.<br />don&#039;t get me wrong, but i&#039;ve ordered over 40 times on silkroad (all domestic orders) and they all took between 1 and 4 days to arrive.<br />sorry but i don&#039;t buy the &quot;blame the german post-BullS*** for the ultra long time&quot;. either it was never sent and we are all getting scammed or our orders where not delivered because he did not put enough postage <br />on the letters. both ways a bit unprofessional and my first bad experience on &quot;the road&quot;.<br />keeping my fingers crossed for not getting scammed :(

				Guys i change my ways. I give a fuck on this reship because nobody can<br />assure me that it will arrive next week. I getting sick of waiting...<br /><br />Asked for my 100% money back as it is my right. Awaiting answer.<br />If he want give me under 100% i get scammed because he never shipped<br />my Order, otherwise he would not accept a reship for every customer !<br /><br />I have enough of waiting. I getting sick of this shit here. No more day, i will<br />try it with another Order from another Vendor... <br /><br />Will update if i have the money back. i am so fucking sure that he wont <br />release the 100% as my right... this is the way to make money...<br /><br />But if he does i will stay fair !<br /><br />Cheers !

				Why do you expect 100% refund, when he has clear rule &quot;I will do a 50% Refund worth in dollars&quot;. How can you expect it after you agreed with half of the risk on your side? 100% guaranteed delivery would have to be more expensive, logically.

				Merc just sent me a message offering a reship too.. I&#039;m the one who placed my order on July 12th, &quot;in transit&quot; on the 14th. I&#039;m in the U.S. though, so I&#039;m seriously concerned. If all these domestic orders aren&#039;t arriving, then the international ones definitely aren&#039;t looking good. I certainly never expected to place my order on the 12th and still have nothing on the 1st - especially when his vendor page states U,S. orders normally arrive within 5-12 business days and his reviews were great at the time I ordered.. no signs of shipping delays then.&nbsp; :( <br /><br />I will say he has been awesome as far as communicating with me. I appreciate the reship offer too, but it is seriously going to suck if I have to wait another month for the reship to arrive as well... My order has already been extended in the resolution center, but it only has 8 days left until I&#039;ll have to ask for ANOTHER extension so I don&#039;t auto-finalize. I was looking for a solid MDMA vendor because I&#039;m definitely planning on becoming a solid buyer, but this wait is kind of ridiculous.&nbsp; :-\ <br /><br />Once again, I hope everybody gets some good news from the mailman soon... <br />-lauren

				From my Side is sure: <br /><br />- He drive our Orders over the Boarder to ship it out ( he still delivers from NL but ships from DE or BELGIUM) !<br /><br />- All purchased Orders that have &quot;delays&quot; was never shipped !!! <br /><br />- People that have ordered and just get the 50% refund get scammed !!!<br /><br />For all other Customers who speaks for him: Fuck you ;) We are Loyal Customers and we have<br />the RIGHT on our side. Normaly i accept the Refund Policys - BUT he use it to make money for <br />sure because he know which orders are been shipped an which not. Do you really think he says<br />to every customer: no problem. i ship you all your orders twice. He said because he know its his<br />own fucking mistake.For all other who will not believe it: Fuck you.

Don&#039;t You think it&#039;s JUST for this cases? Can You imagine, that maybe he sent it correctly, and he will also get (back) only 50%? You think it&#039;s impossible? Maybe he suspects You are lying, in similar way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if he sent it or not, like i didn&#039;t know, when it happened to me.

				@chicagomix-Thanks for the advice.<br /><br />I put my order in the resolution center today and requested a week extension. 2 weeks and nothing=( usually only takes 6 days to receive (from other vendors in Germany). Really want to see his gear. Love to see merc pull through<br /><br />@StevenMcTowelie- 50% refund is fair ONLY under normal circumstances but seeing so many no shows I dont think its right. also his vendor rules are more of a guide line seeing how he clearly states on his page &quot;98% of orders arrive, I do not offer reships (if it didnt make it the first time why would it the second time)&quot;. Its hard to believe that so many of us fall in the 2% minority of not receiving orders... and him offering all these reships after the statement on his page just strikes me ass a little odd. Im not trying to get screwed/scammed, Im trying to find a steady source for trusted quality. I hope this all works as of now its quite an unpleasant scenario.<br /><br />As I said before Im not sure how I feel about a reship, Maybe if i could throw the extra btc for tracking on it=)<br />Mercury has been pretty prompt with his responses to me which I appreciate, but talk doesnt amount to a whole lot if theres no shows=(<br /><br />Best wishes to all

				hi guys,<br /><br />i am new to the forum. was only reading this and other threads before but mercury got me to actually register in order to write something here. i am now waiting for my order for like 10 days. first i was thinking, well, it might take a while to arrive according to other reviews but he is a trusted vendor, so lets do it. <br />now, after reading all of this, i kinda lost my hope to get my package. i just cant really believe he forgot so many packages due to the stress of his business or that all these packages got lost.<br />well, i will wait some more...fortunately there are a few really good weed vendors out there, so i am glad i ordered somewhere else in the meantime.<br />and if weeddeluxxe is really serious about what he said earlier, this is gonna be some fun i guess. way to go man! ;)<br />

I&#039;m not an asshole, but I can be one if you try to fuck with me. I am an honest customer of nothing more than the product expected. Delays are to be proudly accept, but to this extent as is currently the case, we have shown enough patience and this motherfucker given enough opportunities, for example through a direct refund or Reship. This seller tries to tactically deceive. He also destroy our good statistics just because he try to SCAM US ! <br /><br />He gives discounts on its products and make attractive Discount Packages to get so much customers as<br />possible. Than he delivered maybe a quarter or a half Part from all Customers who has ordered from him.<br />And he will do this because he can hold trough the delivered customers his Statistic and if someone said<br />the truth that he has get nothing he TELL YOU AS A LIAR AND A SCAMMER - Would you accept this if you<br />just made a Order and get nothing, and you are not the only one ?! We are so much that everybody can<br />see its a Scam from HIS side. I think we all want get High and not get stressed because we have to <br />wait for WEEKS for the purchased Orders that NEVER BEEN SHIPPED from him. Its not funny to chilling<br />in the resolution center, to get maybe just 50% as 100% back. And there is the Money. He scam you minimum over the 50%. This Man is here to make money, and i dont know why but now he try to be A tactical boy...<br /><br />Maybe this Guy read to much Micky Mouse Magazines or Yps! or whatever haha - but he dont know nothing<br />about Hacker Tactics and the possible ways to FUCK HIS ASS FOREVER ;) I think he should do it before he<br />scam his own customers and regular customers... <br /><br />I wait till tomorrow if the promised reship arrives and if this is not the case, we will chop his account, change his passwords, transactions solve, remove bitcoins , locate his activities and much much more. I could not believe when I saw from a friend of mine (he is a hacker/its his professional Business) what is possible there. I&#039;m going this hard way because I have exactly the same steps as the other 100% right. It is evil ends -I can only hope that it complies with its deadline or, if necessary, learn from it ... This bum is still crying like a baby! Mercury31 will definitive lost this Game, i can promise :) Look on his profile after 21 o´ clock if its not fixed !<br /><br /><br />AND IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A FEW SITES BEFORE - ITS VERY INTERSTING FOR ALL OF YOU:<br /><br />Mercury31 STILL shipped from Netherlands. He shipped from Netherlands in the past and change it<br />now as to read into SHIPPING FROM BELGIUM OR GERMANY POSSIBLE. But he still sit in Netherlands<br />and get to drive OUR ORDERS OVER THE BOARDER TO SHIP IT FROM GERMANY OR BELGIUM !!!<br /><br />To the last i will say that we will just overtaken his Account if its not resolved till tomorrow.<br />We dont want to Scam him with the Attack, just take back what we have to get from him:<br /><br />Our Money! He know that he made an Mistake, and if he cant take his Chances or be loyal <br />and fair to us he will feel that he fucked with the wrong. Because i not know where he lives<br />i will attack him digital. He feel save behind his computer and think he can go every way to <br />get money. No way ... Not with me :) I am in right, this will explain my fight !<br /><br />

				VERY HAPPY UPDATE FOR ME AND MERCURY ;) Saturday 03.08.2013 !<br /><br />Beautiful that I can say that of Postman finally had good news for me and my friends today! <br /><br />It arrived today everything. We now have no reason to attack him. Nice that he has taken his chance before <br />it was too late because we say with complete certainty that he wanted to try to cheat us and some even managed has. It was a warning to him and we would have kept our word. Each vendor is actually trying to fuck us not go unpunished, but now let&#039;s not talk about this no more - just chill :) <br /><br />Have fun all of you and have a nice weekend!<br />

				Ordered on 7/21 in USA... Said shipped on 7/22. So far nothing. He did mention it was delayed and not shipped out till 7/26.. So still time for him to make it in the deadline.. Really frustrating to see all these negative reviews and how long it is taking.. Still hoping he will come through.. Asked for an extension on my shipping but if it doesn&#039;t come in the 10 day extension i will ask for a full refund.. Still high hopes.

				Hey guys... awesome to hear that @metabolicman and @WeedDeluxxe ended up getting their orders.&nbsp; :) Unfortunately, mine is still a no show... I normally would just write it off as a post error and give the vendor the benefit of the doubt, but I placed my order with Mercury on July 12th. So far, I&#039;ve received packages from Germany, India, and China (all placed AFTER the 12th, btw) perfectly fine. So. This is definitely getting frustrating. Mercury offered me a reship late last week. I messaged him my new address - he messaged me today saying that my reship would be sent out within 3 days. :/ I&#039;ve already gotten an extension in SR resolution for this order to not auto-finalize and that extension is up in 4 days... guessing I&#039;m going to have to ask for another 10 day extension because there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m going to just go ahead and finalize and hope for the best. GRRRR. Was REALLY hoping I&#039;d have the MDMA as a housewarming gift to myself this week (considering I ordered the shit almost a month ago), but clearly that isn&#039;t happening. :(<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep you guys updated... at least I can vent here a little. ;) wish me luck!<br /><br />-Lauren

				Hi,<br /><br />i am also still waiting for my order. Again today NO SHOW.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />- Ordered on 16.07.2013 (Domestic, 4 different products) <br />- In Transit on 18.07.2013<br />- 1st time asked on 18.07.2013 when it was shipped out, answer: 18.07.2013<br />- 2nd time asked on 25.07.2013 when it was shipped out, answer: 19.07.2013 but all C order went out on 25.07.2013 what it was i ordered.&nbsp; :-\<br />- sent him my complete order again with encrypted address. <br />- Answer was he remembers it and it was sent out and should arrive next day 26.07.2013 if not he will reship everything again<br />- 26.07.2013 again no show. informed mercury with complete order and encrypted address...again.<br />- He said he will send everything out on Monday 29.07.2013<br />- 30.07.2013 still no show. Asked if he was able to send out on 29.07.2013<br />- He said yes, all went out on 29.07.2013<br />- 31.07.2013 still no show. Asked what the problem is. <br />- He said i should be patient he is experiencing big delays in post office. <br />- 01.08.2013 still no show. After reading in forum that he asks everyone to send him message for Domestic reship i sent him this.&nbsp; <br />- He thanks me for understanding and will reship in the next 3 days<br />- 06.08.2013 still no show and no reply to my messages anymore. <br /><br />In short: According to mercury31 my order has been shipped out 3 times and still no show. Which makes it clear to me that it never has been sent out. What Vendor would send out 3 times. ::)<br /><br />Whats going on Mercury? Please answer my message in SR. Thanks.

				As a vendo he is great, in my first order i ordered a gram of K, i forgot to put the correct shipping way, though he sent it to me anyways, it was really stealthy and communication great. but for some reason that K didn&#039;t affect me at all, i even IM 100mg of it and i felt a super slight buzz but nearly nothing, idk if it&#039;s my own condition or what, though quality seemed great and my arm didn&#039;t hurt after the IM which i think if the K was cut it would have hurt.

				this was originally posted on the Mercury31 Review Thread. Just wanted to let you know:<br /><br />hey everyone,<br />i ordered from mercury on july 18th and it was checked as &quot;in transit&quot; two days later.<br />after ten days without receiving anything, i thought &#039;well, okay maybe you should ask whats the problem&#039;. he quickly replied to my messages and assured me everything was fine and he was experiencing some<br />problems with his shipping, but would send it out asap. a few days and a lot of checking-the-postbox later,my order was still missing.<br />so again...asking &#039;where is my order bla bla&#039; and his response was &#039;i already shipped it, so it must have went missing at the post-office.&#039;<br />(this story is hardly to believe since it is my first time in almost 80 transactions on the &quot;road&quot; that something went missing. and those were all domestic/ germany to germany, just like the one from mercury)<br />he offered to reship on monday 05.08 and my order still hasn&#039;t turned up.<br />i know, i know, an order can get lost on the way (post-office, postman etc.) BUT...reading the Mercury Newbee Forum (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=189645.120), showed me that i am not the only one.<br />people like weeedman, frankymachine, yeahahaa, chicagomix and apollo9876 are also having the exactly same problem with this seller.<br />my assumption, is that 1 in every 10 or 20 customers will experience the same as i mentioned. this way, his statistics and rating won&#039;t get all too messed up.<br />i will gladly update this message and say a big sorry to mercury if i was wrong and my order (in some kind of way) will finally show up, but keeping hope alive is getting harder with each passing day... ::)<br />see this post as some kind of &#039;warning&#039; if you don&#039;t want to see yourself in my position/or the users mentioned above.<br />sorry for the long text :)<br />regards pill poppin animal<br />(@ mercury:if you want my SR name, so we can solve this issue, write me/reply me/)

(which doesn&#039;t mean, i am not going to think about it, if the situation for me/ us,<br />can be dealt with properly)<br /><br />@iknowyouknow666:<br />i am,in no way discrediting this vendor but simply stating my situation (and the situation of a lot of people). have you ever ordered something domestic (from somewhere in your country, to your home)?<br />well i/ and the other guys have and this is the first time something disappears (almost 80 transactions). i hope you can understand my suspicion. <br />and believe me, i wouldn&#039;t even post a single word or said something if i was the only one (which makes it easier to believe,that something got lost during shipping)<br />one final question...when did you order ? i bet, not 3 weeks ago just like me and the other dudes ;)<br />(3 weeks of shipping domestic would be acceptable maybe in siberia, but in the middle of europe...)

				@iknowyouknow666<br /><br />lets talk again after mercury has told you over and over again that he sent it out. First it was Thursday, No then it was Friday, a week later it was Monday,&nbsp; but evidently it has never been sent out. What Vendor would send out 4 times?! then it was the posts fault then it was the fault of getting to many orders at once, then he forgets what you ordered. and then lets see you lose 200€ or more of your money after waiting for 20+ days for something which other vendors take 2 days max to arrive. <br /><br />And good luck with receiving your order. you may get lucky or not, it&#039;S like lottery these days with mercury. <br /><br />I am glad that people complain here in the forums. If&nbsp; this would have happened before my order with mercury, i would have never ordered.... <br /><br />I do not approve with what WeeDeluxxe is doing. This is business. You don&#039;t talk like that or threaten people. You&#039;ll never have success this way. Plus now trying to get people to pay you so you can hack mercury in tor network!? come on how old are you? if this was that easy don&#039;t you think the feds would be hacking all Vendors accounts already!? <br /><br />My current situation is I have asked for a 100% refund from mercury. since i just can not wait any more. i hope you all have success in either getting your order or your money back. And please keep informing whats going on. this is the only way to be safe on SR. Even if people like iknowyouknow666 don&#039;t understand.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				you are right. should have been here by today the absolute ultimum latest if he shipped on monday. in his reply to my message he just told me to be patient, i would get my package. well, as i said, my hope is kinda lost. i will give it an extension to my auto finalize date once and after that i will ask for my money.<br />as i said, i respect people that fight for their rights like weeddeluxxe, but i will not pay btc for a hacker just for a transaction over some 50 € or something. not really worth it and also not the way i wanna do business.

				Yeah, i ordered same day as Apollo, marked shipped 18th but i am international far away so it is only a touch late, few days, for me. From what I can see though he is still doing business though yes?, he may have got snowed under as his business would seem to have exploded very rapidly. I was very impressed with my first order so I have faith for this second (have a third in transit also but it is not due yet). There is probably little point inquiring with him on my end&nbsp; until it is very late. (more emails for him to read when he could be mailing orders :) ).<br />Please keep us all updated.<br />Are there many like us waiting? It would seem they are slowly getting filled?<br /><br />(threats on this guy would seem not just premature but inappropriate, he is probably just having problems managing such rapid expansion.<br /><br />A blanket statement from the vendor would be great at this point.

				Well, here&#039;s my shitty update, guys.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Today marks exactly one month from when I placed an order with Mercury31. Absolutely not shit has arrived from him as of today. My order has been in SR resolution for weeks - Mercury has been accepting my extension requests so this order does not auto-finalize. He&#039;s supposedly shipped out my reship. I&#039;m in the US and his vendor page states that his orders normally arrive to the US within 5-12 business days... yeah, not so much. It has literally been an entire fucking month since I clicked order and I&#039;m REALLY wishing I would&#039;ve gone with someone else... I just placed an order on Coinbase for 5BTC and let&#039;s just say not a single bit of that is going to Mercury31. This entire experience has been almost hilariously bad.<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you guys know if my order ever arrives, but I&#039;m seriously doubting it at this point. Awesome to hear the rest of you are slowly but surely getting yours, though. Hope everybody has a great week!<br /><br />-lauren

				Yes I have two orders, still waiting to arrive one very overdue and one slightly. I do hope something can be worked out. Important to remain positive and as previously mentioned it is encouraging to see some orders coming in albeit late. <br />edit: the late order arrived. Still one in transit (it is also late but he has been very up front about the fact things are late).<br />I have now reordered with M31

				Hi,<br />I also received mine today (Aus). Actually I had laid off messaging him because I just thought wait and give it as much time as is reasonable. It got so late though (marked in transit on 18th July) I finally messaged him. He seemed genuinely concerned for my order. I did not respond to his message (that asked for more details of order). I am glad as I collected it from our box today! Hooray for M31!! I am glad as I really had high hopes for him.<br />I think it says great things about a vendor: He admitted he had a delay, he is doing reships for his local people in EU, and has maintained good coms. <br />Thank you M31 for doing the right (wish all vendors had this type of good ethics).<br />I have another in transit still but it is only a little late. <br />Great, I will order again now. Cheers.

				guys he is not a scammer!!! i just got my stuff in today my first order with him, it took 3 days before he marked in transit and 9-10 days to arrive to USA, people who are not receiving are probably being confiscated the stealth isnt all that but good enough for the millions of pieces of letter mail that is mailed daily. Dont give up on him he is for real, selectively scamming for a few bucks here and there?? why to keep 50% of a $100 order or less??? I dont think so, he makes way more by doing straight business. This guy does mad volume, just kick back and wait it will show up. If not he reships or refund most of your money he wouldnt do that too much headache for not enough reward.

				My first order from M31 took over 2 weeks to arrive (I&#039;m in the UK and other German suppliers can ship to me in 3 days).&nbsp; Although it took a while, it was very good quality and overweight, so I made a bigger 2nd order.&nbsp; Then I noticed he was getting lots of negative feedback, to show him some support, I finalized early &amp; left positive feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />He&#039;s now had my $440 since 16 August and I&#039;ve still received nothing.&nbsp; When I message him, he replies &quot;I&#039;ll reship tomorrow / in 3 days / this weekend&quot; but nothing&#039;s arrived.<br /><br />Obviously, I&#039;ll update here to confirm whenever it finally arrives, but it&#039;s not looking hopeful.
