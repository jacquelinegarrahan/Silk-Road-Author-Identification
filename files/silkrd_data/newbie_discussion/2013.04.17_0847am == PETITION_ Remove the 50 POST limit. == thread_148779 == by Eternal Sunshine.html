				Reason 1: it&#039;s plain stupid because even the most experienced SR users are forced to spam.<br /><br />Reason 2: this is already the biggest forum with and on the long term will be costing the admin a lot of money (bandwidth).

				I agree, Eternal Sunshine, that the 50 post limit is ridiculous. I also have issues with certain sellers, but this forum is not the best place to raise that sort of issue.<br /><br />I hope that SR Admin will reconsider the policy, or at least provide a mechanism that would permit waivers of the limit for good cause.<br /><br />JeanRob

				I can understand to some degree but not 50 posts.<br /><br />I have spent thousands on SR over the last 5 months and I am having issues with a vendor who wont answer my questions.<br />I would like to post on his review thread. Not to slate him but ask other people who have dealt with him if this is the norm and is there any need to worry?<br /><br />Maybe posts should be lower than 50 or go on other things aswell such as money spent, time registered to name a few.

				If i remember correctly one of the main reasons for this 50 posts rule was shit loads of spam threads, generated by some spam bots. I can understand that but honestly it doesn`t work properly because there is still many spam threads. Admins MUST find another solution for this problem.&nbsp; ???

				Yes, the decision to require 50 posts was probably well thought out and yes, there are likely some good reasons.<br /><br />But, as Razorspyne points out, the actual reason for the policy is a closely guarded secret. So, what the hell, we &quot;Newbies&quot; may as well speculate to our hearts content. [i.e., &quot;we need to let Newbies be randomly exposed to the frauds and unscrupulous vendors on SR to increase the commissions SR admin makes off of all sales,&quot; or &quot;we can&#039;t let the Newbies make more posts than Sr. Members or SR Vendors, otherwise we will have to invent more and more honorary titles like &#039;Senior Grand Wizard _____&#039; or&nbsp; &#039;Grand Pubah of the Road ____&#039; &quot;]<br /><br />I agree with discodave, that besides 50 posts, the privilege to post in the other forums could also be based on number of transactions, money spent, or length of time since first registering.<br /><br />I suppose, in defense of the limitation, I have seen some damned moronic, illiterate, and just plain stupid posts (a whole lot like the rest of the internet). But doesn&#039;t the 50 post limit just encourage more of the same? But, I guess I can live with it. <br /><br />After spending thousands and being registered longer than many of the SR administrators, I only recently had any use for the forums. Generally, when I&#039;ve had problems on the road, the SR admins have resolved my disputes fairly without any need to publicly bitch about it. Hell, if I keep this up, I&#039;ll be at 50 in no time.<br /><br />JeanRob

				It can&#039;t be any less than 50 guys, it&#039;s either 50 or 0 (like we had before mid January). 50 is the minimum admin have specified for Junior Member. It is set on the member level, not the post count. But b/c 50 is the minimum set in Silk Road forum&#039;s SMF Global Settings then you assume it;s 50 posts, but that;s not really the issue though.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116905.msg794510#msg794510<br /><br />.... b/c there&#039;s only so many times you can write this.

				Yes, i&#039;ve seen spam issues. But having a post limit only delays that problem. There should be a better solution for this. Now i&#039;m forced to post crap just to be able to create a topic in the rumor mill that i&#039;m sure will help some people. People who are losing money or are being scammed right now! Yeah I could post it on this forum but topics are being pushed down on a very fast pace, so it would be missed and anyway, the newbie forum shouldn&#039;t be a newbie rumor mill. <br /><br />Can&#039;t you implement a system (i guess the module will already exist) that allow users to mark topics as spam and after a few &quot;spam&quot; markings, the topic gets automatically removed. A few moderators won&#039;t solve the spam problem, but the community members who are here to contribute will.

I spoke to someone on this forum and he said it would be too computationally demanding to implement, therefore many forums do not do this, but that it would be possible to make a code for identical key words and limit them to a single post, which would be the same thing here, except more effective.)

				I think there has to be a better way to do it. Maybe verification to an account on the silk road.

				Even if you&#039;re forced to post crap, it gives you time to think about replying quickly and badly to a particular post or giving incorrect reviews. Admin can also make a judgement based on your 50 posts in case of an issue that crops up. If you make 50 quick spam posts and then go on to either heavily praise or heavily hammer another poster or merchant, admin can look at your history and decide if they think you&#039;re being unfair. If you&#039;ve built up a score of 50 over a number of weeks and added to the community, your word is more likely to be trusted. <br /><br />Lastly it actually gives you time to get in touch with the community, to get a feel for what it&#039;s all about. So yeah it&#039;s a pain in the butt but hey, in the long run it build a more responsible user. My advice, do some spam and some posts that either help or contribute

				Yeah 50 posts considering how slow TOR is to begin with plus the verification is overkill for filtering out spammers. It also holds a slight bit of irony as most people will spam there way through the system that is supposed to weed out spammers.
