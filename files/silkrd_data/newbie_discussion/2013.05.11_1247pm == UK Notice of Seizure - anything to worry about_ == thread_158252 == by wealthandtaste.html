				Hey, got a notice of seizure of controlled drugs today for a moderate amount of cannabis (over 100g - mods please remove the amount if you think it wise) and was wondering if I have anything further to worry about e.g. am I going to get seriously looked into, is my address now on watch (gonna give ordering a break) or is it just as it says - if I challenge the forfeiture it will go through court? Is it essentially scare tactics and losing my smoke or anything more?<br /><br />Help put my mind at ease.<br /><br />Thanks<br />

				Nothing will happen unless you follow up and contest the seizure. <br /><br />You have just received your first &quot;love letter&quot; from UK boarder force. <br /><br />The best thing you can do is to not order internationally for a good long while. At least not to the same address.<br />Domestic orders should still be fine, as customs don&#039;t have any contact with that.<br />But yeah, consider that address burned. Better safe than sorry.

				Do not let them get away with that! DO NOT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THAT!<br /><br />They are violating the constitution with these illegal searches and seizures! I&#039;ll tell you how I handle these situations. Go down to the local court house and tell the clerk that you want to file a small claim. If you file it yourself it doesn&#039;t cost much. Here in Canada it costs about $100. Don&#039;t let these couriers and the customs bully you.

				Personally I have never been caught smuggling through UK customs, but US Customs has grabbed me coming into the country with hash. Customs considers a border crossing, a Constitutionally exempt area. In other words you have no rights and National Security&nbsp; is put ahead of any rights you may have while within border.<br />&nbsp;Drug Transshipment areas-&nbsp; in US Customs and US Postal service terms are areas that frequent drug traffic. Such as traffic from Holland, or Columbia, etc.<br />&nbsp;Drug transshipment weight requirements for mandatory inspection are any package who&#039;s combined total weight is 1/2 lb or more (over 252 grams). Any package weighing more than 1/2 lb is subject to warrantless search and seizure.<br />&nbsp;If you pay attention to the arrests that are being made, you will notice that the weight of the product being intercepted is always over 100 grams, and in the US, that almost always results in an arrest

				Are some of you guys being serious? As in you really wanna fight it with them as to why they opened the mail? It seems a lot of people are oblivious to the fact that, if there&#039;s any indication or be it dog indication they will open your mail. In my honest opinion you should be grateful customs were kind enough to let you know they seized it rather then doing a controlled delivery and so on. And yes your address is a gonner and I&#039;m pretty sure everything you could ever want can be found domestically in UK. Anyway pal, you know best what to do...

				I&#039;ve yet to see or hear about controlled delivery in the UK, most of the time when they have reasonable suspicion they just bust your door down. <br /><br />PRO TIP - Some of the most difficult doors to take down using a battering ram are PVC doors, they abosrb the shock and it tires the crap out of the dude trying to smash it down. Tough, strong doors are good in stopping potential burglars kicking your door down but are some of the easiest to smash with the ram. <br /><br />PRO TIP 2 - Have a metal gate in front of your, securely and tight against the wall and door, it buys you at least 5-10mins. However depending where you live, you can pick up bad attention and that can raise eyebrows, however there&#039;s doors with steel plates in between but they will cost on average around 3-4k USD.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
