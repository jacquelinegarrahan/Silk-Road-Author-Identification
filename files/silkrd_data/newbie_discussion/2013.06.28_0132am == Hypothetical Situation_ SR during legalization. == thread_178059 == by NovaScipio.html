				In the interest of getting my first fifty posts in style, I wanted to discuss with you guys what your opinions on whether or not marketplaces like SR would survive should drug prohibition end.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Lets say all common illegal drugs (weed, meth, coke, opiates, ect.) have been taken off all of the world&#039;s shit-list. Would SR be able to compete with already established sites like eBay and amazon? Would its reputation as a former black market keep it from changing its website and infrastructure and business model?<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll post my opinion after a while.

				Yes. Silk road is the ultimate example of a free and anonymous(for the vendor not the buyer) market and the free market always has places to fill. There will be people who can afford greenhouses and they will eventually discover the customer-base on silk road and take the reigns from the current vendors.<br /><br />We certainly will not have the same vendors unless they themselves could afford to upgrade. Cannabis costs barely anything to grow so they, being able to grow and sell legally, would need to price this accordingly. At the moment we are not paying for the production but the illegality itself.

				In this hypothetical world there would still be judgement against people who use. The existence of underground markets like Silkroad would be all the more important, especially for people who want to keep their hobbies private.&nbsp;

I would consider consider druggies getting the same judgement as alcoholics already receive.<br /><br />&nbsp;Considering discretion, most legal products such as sex toys, tools, medication, and valuable investments are already shipped discreetly without BTC or PGP. For the most part, it involves the selling company using a billing department with a different name.

				Maybe it will become a tax-free amazon of all sorts of goods.&nbsp; No longer having the blackmarket angle driving it.
