				A friend of mine ordered some of his K and it never came. Terrible communication and seemed annoyed that we wouldn&#039;t FE. After waiting over a month and a half or so he finally gave 50% refund. Obviously I can&#039;t say anything for sure but I got the feeling he didn&#039;t actually ship. I know he is a respected vendor so maybe I just had a bad experience but that&#039;s the only order I&#039;ve ever placed that had problems.

				I&#039;ve ordered from MIMM many times and his quality has always been excellent (I can&#039;t comment on his MDMA crystals). He&#039;s always been very professional and communication for the most part has been good. I do have some grievances though - my second order (domestic, regular shipping) &quot;got lost&quot; in the mail and I had to wait over 6 weeks for a 25% refund which I have yet to claim. Other than that things have been great.

				I have ordered from MIMM both with and without tracking. They all came through no problem. They also send tracking # if you go that way and have great stealth. I ordered c, not weed or mdma but the quality of their C was good. They have been here 1 yr plus already and are still at 96% positive. If you are outside Canada customs adds to the chance of not arriving but they are a top vendor.

				i ordered from MIMM last wednsday and paid the extra for tracking. i got the g of mdma cuz he sounds so professional and has been here a long time and has some respect from the community. He is probably a pro but i don&#039;t really like his system. He says he takes three days just to process, then 4 days after he puts it in transit he sends the package. i messaged him about this and all he said is, i have three days to put you in transit before sr says i am late and then he took four days to send package after it was in transit, got my tracking number and today it just barely registered as leaving canada. I have ordered from three other vendors since this order and have recieved all three before MIMM. i sure hop his product is worth the wait becuase if it is not MIMM&nbsp; is just a poor choice for me, better to gowith&nbsp; quicker domestic service or at least better quality from international. my advise to MIMM is to hire some help to get orders out faster and i can&#039;t speak to the quality yet but i will be back to do that.

				I ordered from him recently. He took a couple of days to mark in transit but it didnt seem excessive. Order was tracked and came faster than expected. He gets a ton of orders a day so it is not hard to fathom that it takes a few days to safely get all of the orders out, i would rather wait a few&nbsp; days than lose an order because the vendor just dropped 30 packages in the same post box.

				I´v bought Meth from MIMM about 5 times I think. The first batch I got was fire and I had high hopes for the next one to say the least.<br />But it all turned to shit&nbsp; :&#039;( <br />The following batches where bad to say the least, smoked 1gram in 2 days just to stay awake, tasted bad, yeah it was very disappointing compared to the first one.<br />I´d ordered one a couple of weeks ago and I have to say it was better then but no cigar.<br />One thing I´v never experienced with MIMM is the no-shows many of you mention, I´v never had an order take more than 7 days from the time put in transit. <br />If it´s not put in transit the same or next day it does not bother me, they have 4 days, allowed by SR, to take care of the order, more than that and you are allowed to cancel... but that bothers me allot, Why the fuck should we pay a fee to SR for canceling? They don´t do it for us, they don´t waste any time on it so why the fuck should they get payed for it?!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Bought his meth about 5 times and got great quality product everytime. When he was a newer vendor the shards were a bit moist. but the product was still good. Following that, all the shards came clear, clean and felt nice. I should add that I&#039;m an occasional user and used it without a tolerance and my experience with crystalline meth is quite limited. He&#039;s a very busy vendor, so you can expect your order to ship in 1-3 days and be discreetly packaged. It&#039;s been a few months now so I can&#039;t vouch for any current criticism or praise.

Obviously if you do not need to then do not FE for any vendor, escrow is there for a reason.<br /><br />In my experience MiMM has been nothing but professional, they took care of an intercept that happened due to them being profiled late last year affecting many people and the reship made it without any problems.<br /><br />Personally I tend to steer clear of the really big vendors now as I prefer the level of service I get with vendors not as slammed with orders, I do not like waiting 4 days for a reply to my messages for a start. I know a few people who have been nothing but happy with MiMM and others who never got their orders... make of that what you will.<br /><br />ssbd<br /><br />

				We are selling crystal meth out of Canada (the only other seller really next to MIMM), and we have cheaper prices - and are constantly messaged back with nice things to say about our quality.<br />We&#039;ve also heard from people who have had both mine and MIMM&#039;s gear and they said our quality beats his tenfold.<br />Not trying to slam him - I&#039;m sure he&#039;s a great vendor - but we&#039;d love you to try some of ours and get a comparison!

				@samesame, his FAQ actually states that he ships a few business days after your order is marked as in transit, which alone takes at least a day to happen. For a vendor with that many orders though, this is understandable.

But it did take 2 days for me for my order to move into transit, and I imagine another two days for shipping is only the best case scenario. I&#039;ll see within the next two weeks though.

				I&#039;ve been waiting on a gram of hi-heat blow since my order screen told me it was shipped on Feb. 12th. Granted, I do live in Asia, but all of the other Canadian stuff makes it here in 10-14 days via snail mail. Just sent him a message about it all, will let you know how it turns out when I hear back from him. I don&#039;t want to jump the gun and start making accusations because it doesn&#039;t really do anybody any good and I tend to look for the good in people anyway. If it&#039;s lost, it&#039;s lost, that&#039;s all. Now we just have to go on from here and work something out.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; My first SR purchase was from MiMM. I purchased a gram of MDMA. His communication was good considering he sends out tons of packages a month. It took about 8 or 9 days after I placed my order to arrive to the Midwest. He claims his MDMA is pure and reagent tested. I assure you the gram of MDMA I received was not pure. I did roll but it felt pretty dirty. The peak was super short and it was the only time MDMA made me vomit (20 minutes after I took it, and then again the next morning). It was white powder and smelled like it had been cut with something like Comet Bathroom Cleaner lol. But I have read some good reviews about his product. I am not making an accusation but it seems to me like he could possibly be practicing the ol&#039; bait and switch method. I will not order from him again.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The last time I ordered MDMA I bought from a vendor named, &quot;4sale&quot;. Unfortunately, he has disappeared. His product was BALLLLIN! And I rarely use the term &quot;ballin&quot;<br />

				I gotta give some love to MiMM for his product selection. MDMA with a bit of meth =&nbsp; heavenly.. a bit of H on the comedown, and a buit of meth and H for the next few days (I don&#039;t get much of a comedown from meth and H like I do with MDMA; benzos compeltely negate sketchiness from stim comedowns for me). I&#039;ve only bought his crystakl and it was good quality so I can&#039;t rate anything else. I&#039;m overwhelmed by who to choose for the MDMA I&#039;ve been planning to buy for a year now lol. Lucky Lucciano I hear is great so I might just grab an oz of it (I think thats his minimum).

				I recently had a good experience with CanadianForger for domestic MDMA. I found an initial dosage of 125 mgs, topped up with another 75 over the course of the evening gave me a lovely roll with great euphoria, blurred vision, etc. If you look at CFs review thread, he seems to have consistently good reviews regarding this MDMA.

				I might as well come out and say it.&nbsp; &nbsp;MIMM touched me there too.&nbsp; (Sniff)<br /><br />Seriously, I ordered tan MDMA and got an inert white powder.&nbsp; Did the whole 1/2 g in a few lines and nothing at all.&nbsp; Not a thing.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it was icing sugar or dextrose.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had one bad batch of meth from him, but all the&nbsp; others were great.&nbsp; His ketamine was unbelievable.&nbsp; So potent.<br /><br />Anyway , I MSG h about the fake MDMA he sent .&nbsp; He said all his reviews are excellent and it&#039;s just me complaining so no refund.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never ordered again since.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I read a post where MIMM said to a buyer who complained of getting fake coke from him,&nbsp; that MIMM s worker was to blame .&nbsp; Probably stealing. <br /><br />I think MIMM has a lot of workers working for him and when they get the chance , they switch a Baggie or steal a pack that &quot;fell off the back of the truck&quot; sort of thing.<br /><br />He don&#039;t care.&nbsp; He&#039;s got it all automated basically.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pay attention to his messages.&nbsp; They seem like they are copy and paste responses to people .&nbsp; Also it seems like there are different personalities in their reviews.<br /><br />I&#039;m Betting the real MIMM left the road about 5 months ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a fine tuned business machine that remains.&nbsp; They got a condo in west coast set up like a factory assembly line.&nbsp; Different people in different shifts are manning the computer terminal to respond to messages. <br /><br />I say this because I tried messaging a few times and either nothing in return , or just a few words in an incomplete sentence.&nbsp; So vague.&nbsp; So hollow.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s all monkeys running the operation for bannanas.

				I initially avoided MIMM, despite the impressive product lineup, due to his stance and attitude toward FE. There were also rumours of selective scamming - connected to FE or not, I could only guess. I eventually did order some red armanis - they arrived, no problem, though I have yet to try them. I did not attempt communication so no idea about responsiveness there.

				Hey guys, first post here.&nbsp; I just wanted to say that although the stealth and quality of MiMM&#039;s coke, it seemed a lot of his packages were being intercepted at my countrys customs, so I ended up ordering off thestore...
