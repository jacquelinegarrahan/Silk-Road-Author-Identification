				Check out MarloStanfield for some good #4, he&#039;s an up &amp; coming vendor with supposedly great gear and prices.<br /><br />Or try out Nod4Less if you want some expensive BTH but just like a .25 taste for $60.

				oh dear. buldog has put a customers name and address on the forums after some sort of disagreement.. make sure to stay on his good side. he&#039;s had at least 3 vendor accounts because he keeps getting banned and i think the consensus is italy is another one of his new ones so you&#039;ve essentially ordered from the same person :-\ good luck
