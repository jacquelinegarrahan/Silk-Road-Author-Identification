				Alright chaps...<br />I need a bit of advice... I&#039;m going to a festival (3 days) and me and a friend of mine are taking some pills, MDMA and some coke. About 10 years ago I used to do a lot of pills and speed but never done coke. Do you reckon I should get some of the good stuff (for example from &#039;Dispater&#039;) or some of the really good stuff (for example from Symbosis)? I was gonna get 3.5g from dispater and 1g from Symbosis but now I&#039;m wondering if I should just get 4 or 5 gram all from Symbosis.<br />I know it sounds like a crazy question, I mean why wouldn&#039;t I just get the better stuff. I&#039;m just worried it might be a little too strong for me.<br />Should I just do small lines or should I get it from both and just have a small amount of the stronger stuff. I don&#039;t want to ruin the festival by having stuff that&#039;s too strong...<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Sounds like fun man. I would say get the best you can afford and with the best reviews. Coke isn&#039;t something that will &quot;ruin&quot; anything for you (except maybe the comedown, ha). The higher quality stuff will just feel better overall. The best coke I&#039;ve ever done felt amazing but also was pretty mellow. I&#039;ve done a lot, and the dirty street stuff actually tweaks you out WAY worse than the good stuff does. So just go for it, get the good quality, start off small so you know what it&#039;s like, and have a blast&nbsp; ;D nothing like rolling on some good molly and then realizing that you have some blow in your pocket too, weeeoooo. Cheers!

				Awesome, thanks liquidcrystalvision that&#039;s just the advice I was looking for. A few grams of the good stuff it is then!! :-)<br />When it comes I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s gonna be in a rock, how easy is it to crush into powder? I&#039;d like to keep it in the vacuum pack it comes in to help me get by the sniffers at the festival.<br />Will I be able to crush it with a credit card or something? Other than that do you think it&#039;d be better to crush beforehand?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Well over the past few weeks i&#039;ve spent a small fortune on trying all the UK vendors &amp; I can honestly say that although Symbiosis&#039;s coke is very good indeed, Dispater&#039;s comes a very close second and when you factor in the price difference, it&#039;s a no brainer, Dispater is definitely the best vendor on here &amp; is the only person i will buy from now.<br /><br />As far as delivery time is concerned, wow, its like buying from ebay only faster.&nbsp; This guy really does care about his reputation &amp; does everything he can to maintain it.<br /><br />For those who complain about SR prices v street prices, get real.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not had quality like this for years from local idiots.&nbsp; You get what you pay for afterall.<br /><br />
