				I used spendbitcoins here in oz &#039;(cause I can deposit otc in four banks anonomously) last week &amp; it was in my wallet in 3 hours, awesome!. This week I go to their site and I am redirected to bitcoins now. They only have 1 bank I can deposit at and it has been 2 1/2 fucken days and I still havent received it! They said if its not deposited within 4 hours send them a scan of the deposit slip and they&#039;ll chase it up, so I did that as well as ask a couple of questions, no reply. Well 2 mins before the 48 hour limit where they say the money will be deposited I get a brief email stating they&#039;ve &quot;run out&quot; of bitcoin, they are sourcing new suppliers so this wont happen again and they are very sorry.<br />I was most pissed off that they ignored my questions. Is this a regular problem with an unstable new currency? as I have seen a few posts about bitcoin buying problems only in the last day or so. <br />I guess this is just a pissed off rant because 2+ days to get BC into your account is frustrating when u have your eye on particular goodies.<br />I would like to think this is just a temporary hiccup, I fuckin hope so. Otherwise I&#039;ll need to plan at least several days ahead on my buys which can be a problem when U live day-to-day like me...
