				Maybe someone can help me understand something. I would say out of all the forum reviews for vendors, most reviews usually come from new people with little forum posts. I&#039;ve seen people with like 3 posts, registered for 2 weeks give great sounding reviews. I would think that if a vendor really is great there would be much more established people working with him and putting up reviews. I just can&#039;t help but feel a little weary when new people are mostly responsible for raving reviews of vendors. Opinions?

				What reviews are you reading, and what exactly are you trying to get? Only ask that because from everything that I&#039;ve been paying attention to there&#039;s plenty of trustworthy vendors that have been doing this and getting reviews for quite a bit of time. You&#039;re just going to have to take that leap, do thorough research before making a purchase or selecting a vendor and then order with no fear&nbsp; :D

				That is what I plan on doing. If I ever decided to make a purchase, I don&#039;t care how good the offer looks, how reliable the vendor reviews are, at the very least, if any vendor wants me to FE early, I just don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that. I&#039;ve seen way too many people get scammed, and I don&#039;t really use the internet and sites like this too often.

				A lot of reviews are written in exchange for freebies/samples, special deals etc..&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t mean that the actual reviews are bogus though, regardless of the author&#039;s forum status.<br /><br />The best method to apply, is to research the vendor themselves. How long have they been trading? how many transactions? etc..&nbsp; It also depends on what you&#039;re looking to buy. <br /><br />There are well established vendors on SR who either won&#039;t ask for FE, or will ask but with whom you can safely do so.<br /><br />Product reviews are subjective, purchasing experiences are more important imo.<br /><br />

				Considering that on here once people receive what they are buying they don&#039;t waste their time with a review.&nbsp; I will say as a Newbie I didn&#039;t even know about the forums at first and spent no time here.&nbsp; Once I was burned by a vendor I looked for ways to spread the word and that&#039;s when I found the forum.<br /><br />I felt like you did so I made a point of writing a review after some experiences here on SR.&nbsp; I will continue to do so in an effort to help other new people on here.&nbsp; Here is the review I wrote:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135701.0<br /><br />People want to just get what they buy and not be troubled with anything else.&nbsp; It&#039;s drugs so most people want to stay anonymous as possible and spend as little time using the TOR browser as possible.<br /><br />Researching vendors doesn&#039;t mean they will not take advantage of a newbie but I have nothing to lose or gain by being honest so I am.&nbsp; I&#039;ve paid for my orders so I have not been persuaded by freebies which sounds wonderful but keeps my opinions unbiased :)<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Blessings!

				Safety, I believe is in sticking with Vendors whether newbies or not who have the best feedback and ratings from customers. for instance I just ordered from a new vendor( Jimmy Neuchron98)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/806f4aa491&nbsp; &nbsp;this vendor has only been on the Road for 4 months but has a 98.3% positive feedback from 95 transactions. then from the rating his customers gave him were mostly all 5/5s I had a lot of confidence in trying him. So I did and got my order in 2 days! with absolutely flawless stealth and double vacum sealed product. I&#039;ve yet to test the quality, but from the ratings I&#039;m sure it&#039;s gonna be insanely good product.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />so imo who has the best feedback and ratings regardless of how new or long they have been of SR is the key to a good and safe transaction:)

				I for one have been ripped off from FE.&nbsp; This was a vendor with great feedback and has been on SR for almost a year and tons of transactions.&nbsp; He/she claimed to have sent me out another package but I did not receive either one and yet when I ordered from someone else package arrived in 4 days.&nbsp; I think it is a Newbie scam because you have no previous buying power to back up what you are saying.&nbsp; There&#039;s no way both packages this vendor AlbertHoffman1943 sent me was lost.&nbsp; I have since ordered from a 3rd vendor as MidnightBlue was out of what I wanted and I bet I won&#039;t have trouble with him/her either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Point is...You never know.&nbsp; So stay away from those vendors that require FE!!!!!

				It definitely takes research to make informed choices. I think a lot of the reviews are motivated by fear, on both sides. The buyers either don&#039;t want piss off a potential source or tries to blackmail the vendor in favor of a&nbsp; good rating and then some vendors start talking about anything less than a 5/5 will get ya put on the ban list, etc. etc. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a perfect system but looking at the feedback on SR and then finding any threads over here to review, plus vendor join date, rating and amount of transactions will steer you in the right direction.

				This is in response to AlbertHoffman1943 who rips off NEWBIES!!&nbsp; I have nothing to hide but newbies have everything to lose if you buy from this vendor!!!<br /><br />Here is his recent email to me:<br />AlbertHoffman1943(99)&nbsp; &nbsp; i see that you gave me 1/5 rating and i wanted to write you to ask you to revise it to a 5/5. i&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t know how the system works here so i&#039;ll explain it - a 1/5 rating is for when you were ripped off and treated like shit by the vendor.<br />i assume you didnt get your orders since i never heard back from you but if one thing is for sure, i bent over backwards trying to make it work for you. i spend so much time writing you and communicating with you beyond having sent the orders, that i think it&#039;s only fair that you do me better than a 1/5. if you look, the one other customer (out of nearly 140) who didnt get his package, still gave me a 5/5 because of the customer service i gave him. for what i did for you, i would hope you would do the same and explain your disappointment in the comments. thx<br /><br />and here is my response to him:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t been on here for awhile so I am just reading this today, 4/18.<br /><br />You were the first vendor I purchased from and yet the only one where the package did not show up...TWICE!!!<br /><br />Your customer service may be good but it wasn&#039;t your customer service I was purchasing. If I wanted to go back-and-forth and email someone I would write my mother.<br /><br />You seem to forget that I had to spend quite a bit of time writing to you...Are you going to pay me $100 in Bitcoins? I&#039;m not spending anymore time as I have spent more than enough in complaining/corresponding/emailing with you.<br /><br />Let me say this one last time. I had NO problems with various other vendors except for you. One time is believable but TWICE! Be grateful for the one person who still gave you a 5/5 just because of your emails but I am not lonely or looking for an email partner.<br /><br />Take care.<br /><br />SO...as you can see unless you want to give a vendor over $100 because he/she will write you stall tactic emails and have NOTHING show up, I can assure you better karma if you simply send me your hard earned money.&nbsp; Needless to say, my 1/5 will remain as I am unable to give him/her what is really deserved... 0.<br /><br />Why risk it when there are others that have ZERO negative reviews. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135654.msg965941#msg965941">Quote from: AlbertHoffman1943 on April 02, 2013, 02:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To DWinchester: you really are something else.

				If it is a popular vendor. There are normally threads out there discussing the quality of each vendors product. Some vendors even start a little &quot;competition&quot; about who can describe the product most precisely. Granted, this is for the high quality ones mainly. And by precisely I don&#039;t mean an abnormally positive review. But an accurate one.<br /><br />But if the vendor you have in question is a smaller or fairly new one... You are shit out of luck with regards to reviews on the forums mostly.

Customers fear vendors and I think thats why alot of ratings have no information. its a way to say something wasnt right. Not in every case but im sure in some. I love to write up ratings with my true feelings. I can still give them a 5/5.<br /><br />Newbies do need to watch out for selective scamming being new some vendors can have more experience than you and know how to scam you without you being able to do much. If you dont have a forum account you cant even post in their reviews topics on the forum until you make 50 posts. By then they have buried your rating and dont care what you say in a forum. They will back it up with their large number of shipments that have made it.<br />The thing is this I have been dealing with the UPS USPS and everyone else in between extensively for years. I cant say much but I have gone to post office workers retirement parties. In all the time I have dealt with shipping I have seen my fair share of damaged packages and that happens from time to time. Usually due to being prepared poorly for shipping. As far as truly lost and not delivered to the wrong address but truly sent correctly and gone forever I have seen 2 packages. Both were nothing of any value to anyone other than the person who needed it and both were not worth very much and didnt look like they were either.<br />The point im trying to make is many expensive things have been shipped and never stolen by anyone in between. Most losses can be tracked down or explained. The various shipping companies are huge. They are professional and most of them do their job. Like one person told me this is their trade not just an hourly wage. With all that ships through Ebay and every other online store these companies have to be professional.<br />Now if a SR vendor ships something that is so obvious would someone (postal employee) in between take it for themselves thinking no claim will ever be made for it? Doubtful. That is just my opinion more likely they will want to exercise their authority and bring it to LEs attention. If something gets confiscated I think a customer would know. So all these &quot;lost&quot; packages that were definitely sent? <br />Someones lying.&nbsp;

				I have seen it done over at BMR and it could be done here. Vendor creates a few accounts to be his customers. Might have to pay the SR fees for the &quot;sales&quot; but its like buying ratings and a reputation thus leading more people to trust you. <br />Also vendors can use these accounts to bury bad ratings with &quot;good&quot; ones. A lot of customers dont go through all the pages of ratings and dont know how to look for this pattern. Its not always obvious and takes some time to research. Some just want to click order and be done.

				You guys are absolutely right about doing research before buying. Another thing to do is checking the profile of the vendor to see when they joined relative to the members writing them good reviews. If a good reviewer has been a member for a year and the vendor only a few months, then it is probably unlikely that there is scam afoot - but you never know for sure.<br /><br />But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that DWinchester (or MommaDJobs or whatever her name is) is a complete loonie with a vindictive and somewhat psychotic streak in her. She is the lone customer calling me a scammer after over 150 successful sales - and for the monster amount of $100, nearly two months ago!!<br /><br />Follow this link (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/008ce4c43c) to visit my profile so you can read the hundreds of positive feedback comments and 5/5 ratings.<br /><br />Follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94316.0) to visit the trip reports thread on my products, which my customers started, not me.<br /><br />Follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0) to read the LSD Avengers vendor review of me (they are the consumer report group on LSD here btw and very good at what they do)<br /><br />And follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=56814) to read DWinchester&#039;s posts here in this community. They are very informative about her personality. <br /><br />And type my name into the search box at the top of this page to see all mentions of me in these forums - there are literally hundreds of them and she is the only one saying bad things about me<br /><br />And finally, bear in mind that DWinchester (MommaDJobs) is on the vendor blacklist due to her complete fucked-upedness. <br /><br />Listen to her at your peril!<br /><br />Nuff said!<br /><br />Happy trails y&#039;all.<br /><br />

				I had ordered from a well know Vendor an was happy with the knowledge as I had read great reviews about the stealth they use, <br /><br />fick me when I opened it I got a hell ov a shock, product still in their blisters and ficking rattling away and boy did they rattle. Gowd it really put shits up me and I am so careful now, of course I included this in feedback i left, <br /><br />maybe a bad day at office for vendor but it should never happen from a trusted seller, as a buyer we only get 1 change, maybe 2 if lucky and that&#039;s it, by by address and the pain of having to find another<br />&nbsp;:&#039;(
