				OK. <br /><br />I discovered SR a week ago and couldn&#039;t resist just ordering coke like a mad man, I am now sitting more than i need anytime soon. <br /><br />My question is how long will it will keep if i just stash some of it somewhere? <br /><br />I don&#039;t live in a humid climate, but I want to open each from their vacuum to sample and add honest reviews somewhere for the various vendors and any potential new customers. <br /><br />If its longevity is an issue, anyone have recommendations on the best way to store it? <br /><br />p.s some of the stealth these guys use is amazing, newbies buy with confidence!<br /><br />

				just keep it dry at room temperature.&nbsp; little glass vials would probably serve you better than plastic baggies for that purpose<br />it should easily last you a year, probably far longer than that - the cocain hydrochloride itself is pretty stable, <br />i would be more concerned about the stuff it might be cut down with, like f.e. sugars of any kind<br />chances are though you&#039;ll finish it, before it goes bad <br />

				Storing coke in dry uncooked rice will keep it fresh and dry because rice absorbs moisture. If your coke is slightly wet or gummy in consistency chop it up, spread it, and leave it under a lamp or warm plate to dry out. High purity cocaine hcl is pretty much inert chemically, providing you store it in a cool dry place, it can last for years. However, as nearly all coke is cut and is frequently cut with other things such as sugars that are not so inert your coke might not keep for as long as it&#039;s meant to. The only way to accurately predict your coke&#039;s &#039;best before date&#039; is to send it off to a lab for analysis so you know what&#039;s exactly in it. Hope this helps you :)

				I&#039;ve never had any for longer than a few days. I have read that it lasts a long time though, like the others were saying. The problem with keeping coke is that I can never find the self control I thought I had to go along with it...<br /><br /><br />JJ

				One of my guys keeps his in a glass vial then puts them in a air tight mason jars and stick em in a dark cool place in his closet. The longest he&#039;s kept it in there was a month if I remember correctly. I also heard some dealers keeps them in the fridge but, I think that&#039;s silly. But, the worst that I seen can happen is it&#039;ll dry up, it won&#039;t grow mold or fungus lol The potency will be the same if not loose just a little and will feel a tad rough going up.

				I went away for 4 months once. I had a stash of coke in a ceiling tile (dry dark place). It was fine when I served it. Put me back on my feet too.

				Lol, blow wont go bad dude. I found a OZ in my wall stash recently and estimated it to have been in there for over 7 years now, and it was great. You can keep it in the freezer if you like. Also like Princess says, uncooked rice, to keep from humidity.
