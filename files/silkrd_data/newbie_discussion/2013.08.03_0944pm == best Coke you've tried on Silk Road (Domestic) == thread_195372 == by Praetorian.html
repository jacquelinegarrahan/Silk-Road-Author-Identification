				I&#039;ve only ordered blow once.. recently actually.&nbsp; PureOrganx. It was definitely the best coke I&#039;ve had in like 10 years.&nbsp; But there&#039;s been nothing but shitty coke going around my area for a while lol.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t as mind blowing as I&#039;d expected.. having never tried fishscale.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m just really not that into blow.&nbsp; Was hoping the quality was why I&#039;ve never really thought it was that great.&nbsp; But I&#039;m back to my theory that coke was the shit in the 70s.&nbsp; We have so many better, cheaper drugs now ha.&nbsp; Anyway, it was worth the money for what we got.. and the bag lasted a lot longer than shitty coke would have so it made up for the premium price.&nbsp; he was one of the cheaper ones I found on here.. tho not as good as the deal you just posted.&nbsp; He used 3 smell proof bags too which was key cause that shit smelled so strong when I opened the bag lol.

				Studio54&#039;s is the best I&#039;ve gotten on the road.<br /><br />I got a ball of Mario&#039;s first batch that was quite good, especially for the price. <br /><br />Nod&#039;s got some good stuff too, at least the batch I tried, however, the price is steep. I think you&#039;re really paying a premium for his customer service. If you need something in a hurry, he can deliver.<br /><br />

				Studio54 has the best cola I have ever tasted in my life. <br /><br />If you want amazing cocaine, then Studio54 has it. Straight up. I am waiting on my second order of the Pure Disco Shit and I simply can not wait! <br /><br />It is some of the purest drug of any kind I have ever had. And dude has top notch professional service.<br /><br />You must be on top of your shit though as he sells out literally in hours as soon as the listings are posted...

				I got a ball from MariosGramShoppe 2 weeks ago for $248.<br /><br />It tested negative for known active cuts, and had no insoluble cuts and melted @ 194 degrees C. <br /><br />Imo that was pure.&nbsp; Perhaps he&#039;s hit or miss?&nbsp; I would never pay $450 for a ball though.&nbsp; <br />

				MariosGramShoppe seems to provide one of the best coke deals on here. The ball I received got didn&#039;t have any active cuts and provided a nice euphoric high.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t absolute fire, like Studio54&#039;s stuff, but it was pretty damn good.

				i definitely can see why one would think $450 is expensive; because it certainly is a lot of money for 3.5g of anything.<br /><br />but there has been nothing that compares (that i&#039;ve had) to the straight fire, pure bliss, utter magnificence that is the PDS. if you like the high cocaine produces then i highly recommend studio54&#039;s PDS 87%......maybe message him and ask for a 1 gram listing or something. <br /><br />it&#039;s cool, really. people should try this stuff b/c it&#039;s amazingly pure and potent.....beautiful. it is beautiful. i have respect for that cola, as one must if planning on doing it. it certainly is absolute fire, no doubt.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s all perspective . Lets say you can get a ball locally for $120 , but , whats the %age? I&#039;d gladly pay triple the price for triple the purity. To me it&#039;s a no brainer. I&#039;ve got a 2.5G package coming from Bungee sometime this coming week, hopefully. There is just no comparing stomped on local crap C to real pure product. It&#039;s apples and ceiling fans.
