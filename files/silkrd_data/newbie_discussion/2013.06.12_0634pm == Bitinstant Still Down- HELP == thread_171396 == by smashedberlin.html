				been trying with bitinstant for 3 days and i keep getting an error message that they&#039;re having trouble with one of their partners. <br /><br />are there any other similar services i can use that do this just as fast? I&#039;m in a time crunch and need to get this thru asap

				Same situation here, then noticed in the threads there are vendors who will take moneypak and reloadit and transfer you BTC right on SR. That has got to be the fastest way to get started. Wish I&#039;d have known it the first day. Glad I avoided bitinstant during that time, lots of people able to make the deposit but then not getting their transfer in a timely manener. I believe the issue is actually with ZipZap not processing the things properly.

				If you into SR, then look in &#039;services&#039;, you&#039;ll find various vendors who&#039;ll take MoneyPak, Reloadit, etc. Just find someone who has good recent reviews, and make sure to follow their instructions _exactly_. Last thing you want to do is buy the wrong thing and then not be able to use it. Usually they&#039;re fast because they just send you the BTC right to your SR account.

				Be careful, I&#039;ve read a bunch of people are getting it to &#039;go through&#039;, then deposit the money and don&#039;t get any btc.&nbsp; Look into localbitcoins.&nbsp; They&#039;re getting great reviews.&nbsp; just be careful, sometimes the most obvious choice is a bad one that&#039;s made to look good by LE.

				It isn&#039;t illegal to buy, own or distribute BTC; why should one be concerned about potentially purchasing from LE on localbitcoins?

Everyone here always freaks the fuck out about buying bitcoins. They all think they need to do some sort of james bond fake name/address/super top secret bullshit method. Bitcoins aren&#039;t illegal. Then you send those bitcoins to a tumbler and a variety of wallets and you&#039;re all set to go.

				There&#039;s a tumbler built into the SR payment system.&nbsp; You honestly don&#039;t need to pay to have your coins tumbled, but have at it if you wish.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing that links your SR wallet btc address to SR.&nbsp; Nobody can look at it and magically know.
