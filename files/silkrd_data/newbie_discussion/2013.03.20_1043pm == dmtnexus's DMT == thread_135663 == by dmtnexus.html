				Ordered 50gms of dmt that came in a glass pipe. As I&#039;ve been wanting to try dmt for over a year, I was pretty excited to finally get to try it. I knew DMT hits hard and fast but it was still quite shocking to see how quickly it affects you. I got really strong visuals for the first few seconds which subsided as time passed.<br /><br />I was hoping to breakthrough but I didn&#039;t really mind. It didn&#039;t really seem to alter my thinking in any way either which I thought was strange. I did enjoy the experience. I felt very calm and refreshed 15-20 mins later. My mind felt at ease. Nothing was bothering me. Will definitely be getting some more.

				First time DMT for me. I have been a psychonaut for ~2 years now with multiple high doses shroom (5-8g cubensis) trips with ego dissolving experiences. Also multiple trips with LSD.<br />Anyway, first I tried a small dose 20mg DMT just to see how it was. I have been researching a lot about it before but what I knew was that the experience was kinda unexplainable. So 20mg, wow, the body feeling and how fast it onsets, holy shit! It was a strange feeling that you could start tripping in so short time.<br /><br />I wanted more, so I waited til everything was &quot;normal&quot; again and tried a higher dose, after a few tries I had a breakthrough experience. And again, it was very strange to lose your ego in so short time. Also it amazes me how similar DMT is to shrooms. Loosing your ego felt a lot like when on shrooms, and also the visuals almost the same but a little clearer, like more HD and more brighter colors. I actually saw the same &quot;beings&quot; on DMT that I had already met on shrooms. But somehow it felt like a could get deeper with DMT and really in to the hyperspace and totally away from my body. Maybe the DMT experience will make my future shroom trips different also. With the breakthrough experience it really felt like I was dying, from the third hit I started to hear these beep sounds like in the hospital for heart-rate, and that beeped faster and faster and my heart pumped faster and faster and everything started to fade away and the room kinda shifted into big pixels and I was afraid, as usual with ego death. And then the beeping just went to one beeeeeeeeeep as it does when you&#039;re dead and the only thing I remember before I was gone was that I saw my feet and I wondered what was happening.<br /><br />It&#039;s so cool to be able to smoke(vapor) a few hits and then lose your ego, go into hyperspace and all that within 60-90 seconds. And you&#039;re back in 10min. And then you are like, WTF just happened. Oh, I love what psychedelics can show you. How aware of everything you get, with your life and what you want to change and so on.<br /><br />Anyway, very quick delivery and though this is the only DMT I have tried so far, it took me to hyperspace so I&#039;d say it is good quality. I&#039;m looking forward to try ayahuasca in the future, and see what a lengthier DMT trip is like.<br /><br />Thank you dmtnexus for your awesome service and awesome DMT :)

				Hi evrybody. I am new to the forum part of silkroad so bear with me...<br />Ordered 250mg last week. Have been trying to smoke it for the first time in a 1.5l PET bottle with the bottom part cut off and replaced with tin foil as recommended in a youtube video. I used a cheap storm lighter with such a small flame it just didn&#039;t perform very well. Just got myself mild mushroomy visuals on top of all layers surrounding me in my room.<br />Realised the bottle was too big anyway and the taste was terrible most probably because the chemical got burnt.<br /><br />So I looked after some small serving alcohol bottle or such, and the smallest one I could find was a 10cl one, but a great leap from the 1.5l bottle. So I tried it using the same shitty lighter as before. Which also had a metal lid that folds 90 degrees straight up almost parallell with the flame so it was damn tricky to see where you pointed the flame when held the bottle against my mouth inhaling. Well I got a little better reaction on this trial and whats surprising was that the vapor didn&#039;t really taste anything before I exhaled it.<br /><br />So I ordered a better jet torch lighter with the flame coming out not straight up but in a 45 degree angel which was better for aiming the hot air in the bottle. So I tried a 5cl bottle yesterday when I got my lighter and a 0.001g scale. So yesterday I tried to load the bottle from the hole underneath and placing it inside the bottle on the steel mesh, that was terrible and half the dose is still in the bottle between the bottle neck and the steel mesh and never got vaporized. So the first thing I did today when I awakened a got up placing just 25mg on top of the bottle, preheated it to try to melt it as best I could, but there was a little smoke so I stopped just melted 75% of it. Set the lighter ablaze and inhaled what felt lika an eternity and when my lungs was almost filled I tried to get cold air inside my lungs and I immedietly start coughing big clouds of smoke... then I thought I would try to get the rest that was left in the bottle , but I just turned on the lighter and was going to put it to my mouth but then suddenly felt I wasn&#039;t going to be able to finish it. So it put down the pipe and relaxed with closed eyes as there was more intense visuals now and the feeling that I just forgot to breath all the time. So I had to force myself to breath all the time... Very nice feeling to it all, but definitly no breakthrough or ego loss... but that&#039;s fine. I strongly belive I have to explore the dmt in my own pace little by little to learn to master the art. At least I&#039;m getting satisfied results now, but the dmt starts to run out for me now, maybe have 60-80mg left. But I will probably do another order soon if I can manage to reorganize funds in some way.<br /><br />Many thanks to dmtnexus for kind support and fast shipping.... you&#039;ll be hearing from me again soon!!!<br /><br />Peace out!

				Had an excellent chat with the Nexus before buying. He/She answered all the questions I put to him/her and tried to accompany me as best as possible. I ended up with 150mg of the DMT as this is all he had left from the new batch so I was just happy to be able to get some. Nexus also went out of his way to explain to me how to make my own pipe as they had sold out of the ones they had on offer.<br /><br />The stealth was excellent. I will not go into any details but there is no way I could tell if my product had arrived without opening all my mail. I tried 2 different 20mg hits using different methods. The pipe failed for me so i opted for the 2 litre bottle with tin foil wrapped around the bottom. This seems to work best and I can get all the DMT in one hit. Last night i tried a 50mg hit and I was on the verge of breaking through but I resisted being overcome by it. Tonight I&nbsp; am going to try 70ish mg (all I have left) to see if I can breakthrough. I have less fear towards it now.<br /><br />Overall I would say vendor gets 5/5 on Customer Server. 5/5 on Stealth and 5/5 on product quality (although i suspect there is stronger DMT out there. I am fine with this product)<br /><br />Will definitely order again when Vendor gets another batch!

				I ordered 250mg of DMT from dmtnexus. I have had one earlier experience with DMT half a year ago and I felt ready to try it again.<br /><br />Without saying too much, the packaging easily flies under the radar, maybe even your radar. <br /><br />Fully aware that I&#039;m being wasteful, I decide to smoke some by myself in a bong. I lie down on my bed, supported by a pile of pillows as I take deep hits and hold them in. After the first one my hands start shaking. When I&#039;ve had enough I take one more hit and put the bong down.<br /><br />I feel heavy. My head rolls back on the pillows and I grin. I&#039;m melting into the bed and I realize I&#039;m back in the place I was six months ago. It has that same underlying feeling that is beyond words. It&#039;s DMT.<br /><br />Am I breathing? Yes I am, and it seems I can inhale all the air in the room before I breathe it out again and repeat the cycle. I feel like I am filling not only my lungs, but my bed&#039;s lungs. I think the rythm of my breathing is indescribably beautiful. I look around myself and there are colorful patterns on everything. They&#039;re mesmerizing. I look at my hands. I wave my fingers and it is the most satisfying thing to do! I laugh.<br /><br />I remember thinking that while I know I&#039;m very, very high, I would still fully understand a sober person. When I picture a sober person I picture my best friend trip sitting me and my pillows become my friend&#039;s lap. I snuggle there for a while, enjoying the strong closed eye visuals, and after a while of bliss I can feel the high wearing off. I put on calm music as I lie and enjoy the ride back to reality.<br /><br />For an hour after the experience I feel completely relieved from the stress of my everyday life.<br /><br /><br />The rest of the DMT I shared with my friends and their experiences are theirs to share, but I can say that they found dmtnexus&#039;s DMT absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Dmtnexus gets 5/5 and my repeat business the next time I&#039;m ready for DMT.

				Ordered &quot;Glass pipe preloaded with a 50mg hit of DMT&quot; from dmtnexus for simplicities sake and very happy I did.<br />Arrived next day and was stealthy and well packed. <br />Vaped well and would have launched had my lighter not failed me (school boy error) , was right there too. Would have no issues ordering again and will do so soon.<br />Recommended.

				I ordered the DMT Machine preloaded with 50mg of DMT and tested it yesterday. I have to say that I got so surprised at how easy it was to vaporize the DMT without burning it that I didn&#039;t inhale the whole thing and abandoned like half of it in the pipe, vanishing in the air (being my first experience after a really frustrating one with the plastic bottle method). So I didn&#039;t breakthrough but the small journey was still beautiful. The peace it brought inside me was definitely something new and refreshing, the visuals were otherworldly and when I closed my eyes a real party of fractal patterns and colors begun. It seemed like it was leading me to something organic and beautiful, but the dose fell short and I got back within a couple of minutes. I carried a great mood trough the rest of the day, really relaxed and peaceful.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m truly happy with the product. With the DMT itself, that was undoubtedly the real thing, and with the machine, that allowed me to use the substance without any troubles. I&#039;m eager to explore this mighty spice in all its dimensions, for now I&#039;m exhilarated by having found a drug that goes straight to the top of my preferences!<br /><br />Thank you, dmtnexus!

				Two friends and myself ordered 300mg DMT between us, intending to try this drug for the first time on Friday night. The delivery arrived by domestic post just a day after we ordered, and was well concealed. This delivery coincided with some LSD tabs bought from another vendor which we spent the day enjoying. When everything calmed down somewhat, I was greeted on SR by a friendly message from Nexus thanking me for my order and wishing me the best. Seeing this, my companions and myself decided to get a taste for the DMT and try a small 15-20mg amount each in preparation for our planned journey on Friday. Using a gravity bong I was privileged enough to board the first shuttle into this new world. <br /><br />Regardless of our experience with Lucy earlier in the day, nothing could quite prepare us for the sheer power and wonderment that DMT provided us; after our first sample we all had a new contender for the favorite psychedelic experience, and the desire to once more take a dip into the rainbow realm. Each of us dosed up to a common dose and were even more blown away by the worlds and visions revealed to us. Deciding to save the rest for our planned Friday night (and maybe resupply ourselves) we left this as the cherry on our psychedelic cake, and a euphoric lid on the night. <br /><br />Nexus has become my first port of call for this product, and has provided myself with excellent product and service promptly and professionally, and I will hopefully be enjoying it again soon.

				Hi everyone just want to share my experience with dmtnexus DMT so here it go&#039;s<br /><br />So i ordered 500mg between me and a friend from nexus and it arrive within 24 hours with great stealth, i didn&#039;t even know what it was until i opened it,<br />we tried it that night, neither of us had tried it before so we where very.... how can i say &quot;novices&quot; so i went first we had a pipe with a mesh on the bowl, we had 50mg split into two for two hits after i hit them i laid back on the sofa and closed my eyes i could see geometric shapes but that was it &amp; same gos for my friend it was just like a lite shroom trip but looking back now we had very poor technique smoking it as it was our first time and we where nervous about it,<br /><br />anyway now to the exciting bit<br /><br />the next night we done it at my place i have a dimmer light so we had the room at a perfect lighting condition &quot;very dim&quot; i went first again and this time in told him to load abit more as yesterday i felt i could of done more, we where very confident for some reason maybe because we both only had a mild trip the night before, this time we used a torch lighter which i would recommend and definitely had better technique smoking it this time,<br />so i started to inhale the vapor, halfway through my 3rd hit there was this noise i can only explain like a buzzing noise which was very intense &amp; i could see the geometric shapes like a boarded around my vision as i still had my eyes open i handed the pipe to my friend closed my eyes and laid back by the time my head hit the cushion the noise had gone but i could see the patterns but they where like stripes moving in a direction very weird,<br />then after about a minute i could feel something telling me to open my eye which i would because i didnt want to open my eyes and ruin the trip but i could feel it telling me it will be ok so i started to open my eyes but to my surprise i wasn&#039;t in my front room, i could see this being above me it was stoking my face telling me to calm down and let it breath for me (as i was struggling to breath) i relaxed and just looked around this dimension (i actually cant find words to describe this place) as i was looking around this entity/being got very mad with me as i wasn&#039;t paying attention to what he was doing or trying to show me but i was just blown away with where i was, then he just melted back into the walls (weird as he was made out of the same stuff as the environment we where in) then everything just fade away and i opened my eyes to be in my front room i tried to get up and walk about and talk as i was very excited to tell my mate what had happened but just fell over and was very clumsy for a minute, it fely like the film avatar when the first go into the avatar and cant really control the arms and legs properly lol <br /><br />very hard to explain my trip as i feel i keep forgetting stuff as time goes by but i hope you can all make sense out of what i wrote<br /><br />i would like to thank dmtnexus personally for that experience<br /><br />cheers&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)<br />

				<br />well good day, 8)<br />i bought 350 mg of DMT, oredered to japan and received it in 5 day, on a Saturday, of all day :o<br />tried a small amount and was so happy, saw my first real patterns and felt at peace after the comedown, decided to let my friend, girl try it.. she has never tried any thing like this in her life..she had a good reaction also...then comes the big one for me..let me explain..i packed my glass pipe and relaxed on the floor with some mattes, it was late at night&quot;which is the best time to do DMT which it think&quot;<br /><br />i smoke three big tokes , hold my breath, led down and was canon shot in to the meaning of life, i was shown why creation is what it is, in short, creation is it self, because it want to be, it is love and it is light...doing so effortlessly, i can only try to say it in words, but would never be able to...this trip lasted more then 14 minutes, after word, i thought i was stuck in this trip, i got a little freaked out, but i returned..this was the most life changing trip i have ever taken...EVER<br /><br />note to get where i got make sure u vapor the dmt in a glass pipe hold the flame half inch under the pipe and watch the stuff boil, when u see some white smoke wait a few seconed,&nbsp; vapor time should be half a minute..or a little more, inhale slow but fill ur lungs, take some more in and if u can some more.. , the lights off and relax...<br /><br />u will see im sure<br /><br />and this gusy product is perfect for what ur looking for...<br /><br />i have smoked about 6 times after and it has been wonderful so amazing..i recommend u dont use any other drugs before, for a week before u smoke DMT..be fully rested and use the bathroom, meditation and stretch, is a big plus also a good prayer is a good luck thing, also ask the dmt to show u what u r looking for... ;)<br /><br />u will get it, dont expect and dont control, just watch..<br /><br />ENJOY<br /><br />Saturn<br />

				Thanks DMTNexus, good to be onboard&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Always glad to make suggestions, sometimes they float....other times....lol ;)<br /><br />Your reasons are fair, if the listing was posted and described in an unclear manner. <br /><br />We personally think that people don&#039;t assume anything on SR, other than what is actually described in the listings and besides it&#039;s easy enough to ping a PM customer if you feel that they are in some way confused or &quot;an assuming type&quot;.<br /><br />The price increase itself would have been relative to the &quot;new product&quot;, so no actual increase (as such) to worry about, in fact you would almost expect a discount to be involved!(existing product + 50mg refill).<br /><br />But we DO completely get where you are coming from. <br /><br />Why fix something that isn&#039;t broke eh?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />We would make a a guess that anyone buying the pre-loaded machine + additional DMT orders would get a discounted deal anyway - at least for those who plan ahead&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />PS - The actual suggestion came after reading through some of your feedback with people commenting that &quot;they did it wrong&quot; (easy to do) and we just thought that it might have been a nice addition to your range to allow those sorts of people a &quot;2nd attempt&quot;, without the need to go through the re-ordering process and the wait...&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Good to see your getting the pre-loads back up - as we said before, great idea!!&nbsp; 8) 8)<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				I highly recommend dmtnexus! <br /><br />Very friendly and helpful vendor! Gave me many good tips and recommendations when I asked for help, and is very easy to communicate with. Usually responds within hours. <br /><br />His DMT is top quality, and combined with his pipe, &quot;the machine&quot;, I reached my first breakthrough experience with DMT at first attempt. His stealth is also A+, and packages always arrive in short time.<br /><br />Dmtnexus is one of the best vendors I&#039;ve bought from so far. 5/5<br /><br />Would also like to add a short trip rapport from the DMT I bought from dmtnexus.<br /><br />Received &quot;the machine&quot; and 300mg DMT in separate orders. Didn&#039;t risk having the machine preloaded because I live in a high-risk country with though customs. <br /><br />First out trying was my friend. I loaded 50mg in the pipe, letting the DMT melt slowly into the cobber wool. I then evaporated it, and told my friend the hit was ready. This was my first time using the machine, and after many other failed attempts earlier with different smoking techniques and a different product from another vendor, I was a little skeptical if it would work.<br /><br />My friend inhaled slowly, and I was prepared to load another hit, as I&#039;ve read that it usually takes 2-3 hits to reach breakthrough. This was no necessary as my friend almost dropped the pipe in his lap half way trough the first hit. I had to catch it so he wouldn&#039;t burn himself. He was completely gone 5-10 seconds after inhaling. He had an amazing time. <br /><br />Then it was my turn. My friend loaded another hit, and gave it to me. I started inhaling, and I remember thinking &quot;it doesn&#039;t taste anything, feels like breathing in hot air, I don&#039;t think I will feel anythobrfimngkbljldk.....swoooooop------&gt;BOOM&quot;. I can&#039;t even remember breathing out. I was gone within seconds. The first thing I can remember is a mysterious entity, which looked very like mix between a &quot;flare dancer&quot; from zelda: ocarina of time, and a flame atronach from skyrim. It was blue instead of red, and it felt like a male. It was like a harsh and strict father figure. It showed me things, dragged me around, throwing things at me, spinning me around. It was crazy and a little rough. I remember being a little uncomfortable, but I soon tried to relax which made everything much better.<br /><br />The strict male entity was changed with a playful and happy female, which looked the same but were red and looked exactly like a mix between a flare dancer and flame atronach. The female did the same things to me as the male, but this time it was awesome and very funny. It was extremely intense, and I was showed an unlimited amount of things. My friend later told me that I was laughing loud, which I cannot remember, but I remember being very happy. <br /><br />DMT is awesome, and I highly recommend it! One of my best and most significant trips I&#039;ve ever had! <br /><br />
