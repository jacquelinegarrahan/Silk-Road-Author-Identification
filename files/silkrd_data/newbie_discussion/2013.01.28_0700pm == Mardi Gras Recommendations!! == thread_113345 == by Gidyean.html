				I&#039;m heading to a Mardi Gras festival in a couple of weeks (unfortunately, not in New Orleans) and as a new SR customer, I&#039;m wondering what you would recommending I bring with me!&nbsp; I&#039;m generally a pot smoker, I did (to much?) acid years ago but was thinking of either bringing the lower dose of ecstasy or maybe shrooms.<br /><br />Which would you recommend?&nbsp; Does ecstasy and/or shrooms mix well with pot?&nbsp; Is there something else out there that I might want to think of bringing along?<br />

				Shrooms + Pot = unforgettable good time.&nbsp; I wonder if having some xanax handy would be a good idea too?&nbsp; I used to use it to enhance / mellow out certain strains of pot

				I&#039;d consider bringing some opiates or xanax along, in case things get too intense.&nbsp; Mardis Gras seems like a fun time, but it&#039;s gonna get weird at some point if you&#039;re tripping, no way around it.&nbsp; Might be good for your nerves if you&#039;re able to pop a bar or do a line of oxy if you feel yourself losing control.<br /><br />Also, if you feel the trip veering towards somewhere you don&#039;t want to go and start to panic, just say to yourself when you took the drugs (&quot;I took mushrooms at 7 p.m.&quot;), note what time it is now, and remind yourself that you took a drug and this experience will not last forever.&nbsp; It will be over around 5-9 hours after you dosed.&nbsp; This really does help.

				If it&#039;s like a techno festival kind of thing, I say go with MDMA and 2C-B. Both are great for festivals alone or even used together. 2C-B doesn&#039;t fuck with your head as bad as LSD or shrooms, but is still definitely trippy as hell and feels great too. Never had the chance to combine the two but I hear it&#039;s one of the best combos ever.

				On the subject of 2C-B, I&#039;ve heard it is literally the most painful drug you can snort.&nbsp; In a weird way, that kinda makes me want to try it.

Actually I&#039;d say 2C-E is much worse, for some reason.<br /><br />I snorted MDAI once and that was pretty bad too. Don&#039;t know what it was for sure though, that was way back when it first came onto the market.
