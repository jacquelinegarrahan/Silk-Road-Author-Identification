				Well i dont know if you have ever heard about how the Bush&#039;s are a big part of the evil alien takeover of our planet, but for their part the USA,(as puppets, as you must note they are nowhere near the problem), but you could find all the crazy conspiracy info on it you want including the youtube videos of Bush Senior, but anyways I have been a skeptic of this Reptilian Humanoid Conspiracy, but from a little random search I am completely covinced the is something very wrong with our society. If you find George W. Bush Jr. on Wikipedia, The picture that I hope is still up, that is a portrait of him, is in full HD, and is very large. Note this, which is extremely important (for me), The picture is officially sourced from The United States Defense Department&#039;s official .gov website!!! You can find the pic on Wikipedia or go to the defense departmnts link here: http://www.defense.gov/photos/newsphoto.aspx?newsphotoid=4269&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you blow it up to full, and zoom in on the eyes so you can see the pupils very clearly, you will notice they are not round, in fact the right one mostly is fucking completerly flat edged on the bottom, ending in a point, a fucking point!!! HIS PUPIL IS SHAPED LIKE A FUCKING UPSIDE DOWN TRIANGLE. THIS IS NOT FUCKING HUMAN AND IF YOU TRY TO RATIONALIZE IT SOME SORT OF SCIENTIFIC WAY YOU ARE A SHEEP. AND! THIS IS BROUGHT STRAIGHT TO YOU, CURTESY OF THE US DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. PEOPLE, MAY LOVE SAVE US ALL.<br /><br />P.S. I really dont know what to do about the horrible truths I am learning everyday but spread this message, and hey what better than to do it anonymously, but if you want to know more than just about stupid old bush PM me please

				It ain&#039;t the Muslims. It ain&#039;t the Big Bad Jews. And it definitely ain&#039;t the reptilian race from the Sirius star system. I don&#039;t know why people don&#039;t point to the obvious: the US government and its New World Order masters. These bombings will create a total surveillance police state, which is what the aim of them was all along. TOTAL CONTROL. That&#039;s what these fuckers want. Funnily enough, we&#039;re sitting right at ground zero for the type of technology that has a chance of saving society. Yes, right here in these forums, SR, Tormail and Tor in general.<br /><br />Getting back to the Boston Bombings, very little of the official conspiracy theory makes any sense. None of the mainstream media ABCCNNBCBS asked any obvious questions about the bombings, or tried to put 2 and 2 together. Big fucking surprise there. Take a look at it objectively and you&#039;ll see what I mean. Don&#039;t believe anything that you hear and only half of what you see. That&#039;s all, folks.

				To Baraka:<br /><br />I am not talking about literal reptilians, but I do believe there is a non-human presence controlling the United States Government, The chemtrails and fibers I am finding in my skin cells is rediculous dude, and I am strictly believing only what I can see, and not the fake shit the government trys to mirror and smoke all over us, the shit that makes sense, there are rules in this world<br /><br />Oh yes but I also am pretty sure what the conspirists consider as reptilians are the ones I am seing, Even though the problem is the US Governemnt, it is essentially much larger, but human beings are much much stronger than they would have us to believe. In fact I believe they have &quot;trained&quot; us into forgetting our unbelievable wealth of power and will. If only everyone could be aware of what is actually happening in the world would anything ever change, the problem is the mind control of the American population. People are to worried about the next episode of their favorite show, Or having enough money for gas to make it to work, Or pretty much just anything that has to do with themself and the betterment of their self. I believe If people could wake up and see the world for what it is, we have the power to change what is happening, unfortunately we are in a vice grip, and from the things I have seen It is only getting worse... But Stay Positive!!!! Forreal
