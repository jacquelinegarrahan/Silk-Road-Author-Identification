				<br />Has anyone ever used a ATM to deposit money into someone else&#039;s account for BTC&#039;s? I am looking to pick up some bitcoins from localbitcoins.com and they request Bank of America deposits. The only thing I have around me are BOA ATM&#039;s. So I thought I could make a cash deposit into there acct through the ATM. I think this can be done. Has anyone ever done it?

				I don&#039;t think this would be possible. First you would need a debit card to insert into the ATM and you would need the PIN. I believe you have to actually go in and fill out a deposit slip.

				<br />I checked around online and it does not look possible. I would need the card and pin. Sure would be nice if the vendor would give me that!<br /><br />Yeah, No BOA&#039;s within about 40 Minutes from the house. Tons of PNC banks and credit unions. Such is life. I will have to make the trip and make a larger first purchase than I had planned.
