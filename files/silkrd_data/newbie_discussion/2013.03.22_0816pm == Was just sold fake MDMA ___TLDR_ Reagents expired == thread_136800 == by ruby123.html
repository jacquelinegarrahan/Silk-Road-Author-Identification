				considering this was my first purchase on the road. I figured I would gamble with 100$. The pils I ordered from the UK turned out to be 2CI or B (Green Marquis reaction) Pills mostly full of white powder few crystals.. This is exactly what I didn&#039;t want. If i wanted to roll the dice and take &quot;molly&quot; I would go buy some on the street. What is my next step to resolve this issue? Any recommendations would be appreciated. Really pissed off because I specifically told the vendor I have test kits and that I do not want any research chemicals. I am not an idiot, I have a science degree affording my competency in chemistry etc..<br /><br />Update: my second &quot;MDMA&quot; order also tested positive for AMT(Brown Marquis reaction) NO MDMA....is there really pure MDMA on the road? or is it all just bunk..Looks like I am going to have to play chemist with some safrole... I just flushed 2 grams of bk-MDMA I purchased which was&nbsp; obviously fake the other day too<br /><br /><br />***TLDR: Reagents expired I made a mistake, MDUK and Aidoneus&#039;s product is top shelf....rave on!

				This should be a word of caution to anyone.....MDMA tests kits are cheap. Your body is a test tube, don&#039;t fuck around with it.

				Hold up.<br /><br />You get two MDMA orders from two different vendors who have both had their product tested by numerous different people with universally positive results.<br />You then test them with the same reagent (I assume) and they both come up negative, despite being the same product that many other people have reviewed positively.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m very confused indeed over what&#039;s going on here, I have never bought or even handled 2CB/2CI, and the capsules I shipped to you were the same ones that I&#039;ve been sending to everybody else, at least two or three of which have marquis tested them and had the classic straight-to-black reaction that I saw when I put them together.<br /><br />Something is very clearly wrong here, it&#039;s not possible that, from a batch containing literally only MDMA, Caffeine and Microcrystalline Cellulose you get a 2CB/2CI indication, when everyone else who&#039;s tested capsules from the same batch gets an MDMA indication.<br /><br />By the by, the pills contain off-white powder because I have to grind the MDMA to get the dosing right, and due to the caffeine and Microcrystalline cellulose which are also in there to keep the dose at ~110-115mg per capsule.<br /><br />I&#039;ve messaged Aidoneus to get his thoughts on this.

				Yes, I purchased from 2 different vendors because I am curious to see what is out there. I can verify everything photographically. Real pure MDMA is a challenge to come by; I just want pure MDMA for an event coming up. Why would I try to burn someone over 100$? I have a full time job which pays very well. The Marquis reagent is &lt;12 months old, it reacted with both orders and came up with different results.

This only gives ammunition to politicians and the media, to rant about &quot;drug are bad&quot;.

				Just obtaining a feeling from &quot;molly&quot; or &quot;MDMA&quot; doesn&#039;t&nbsp; necessarily indicate the ingestion of pure MDMA. A lot of the research chemicals have similar effects. Pure MDMA has a feeling like no other, a certain region of your brain is tapped into. Everyone should 100% test their drug 100% of the time.

				This is what I am worried about. As a new guy here, I&#039;m sure they are legit vendors here, but I&#039;m sure there are also vendors who fake reviews, or might do selective scamming. Not really sure what&#039;s really in it for them to do that though. Especially with MDMA. In certain places it is so hard to come by now, that anyone who really can get a hold of it stands to make a fortune from repeat customers.

				I don&#039;t think the test kit was dodgy. Either the OP is lying about his results, or his test kit was telling the truth. I&#039;ve had test kits work well over two years. The Maquis kept in a cool dry place is very stable, and I highly doubt it was made wrong .

				I am glad people are questioning me; this is how a free market works.I have receipts form when I purchased the original test kit last year and have photos of the recent results.Both molly capsules reacted and provided different results.Logic would seem to indicate that if the reagent was bad, no reaction would occur. My new test kit will be in next week. It is not about the money for me. I was sold some very weird chemical last year down in Miami during WMC/Ultra week. This chemical was sold to me as MDMA/&quot;Molly&quot;, it&nbsp; put me in a very weird state, where I felt my heart about to beat out of my chest.I seriously felt like my conscious was going to escape from my pineal gland. If I hadn&#039;t been experienced with psychedelics and how to control my mental state, I probably would have ended up in the ER. My only wish is that people actually push really MDMA; many of the research chemicals are very dangerous and&nbsp; can lead to serious harm if you are unaware what drug you&#039;ve taken. This harms the entire scene.Even this marvelous resource the Silk Road potentially could be negatively effected if someone bugs out. People should know what they are consuming. Test kits are very cheap and can be found on DanceSafe.org

At this point we&#039;ve heard that they can go bad in as little as six months, though some people have had them stay useful for years when they are stored cold and air-tight. Keeping the testing kit reagent in a well-sealing dark glass bottle, cool or refrigerated may help extend its life.<br /><br />From what I gather the tests can go bad after 6 months. I haven&#039;t seen anything definitive pertaining to a time frame even on the home scientist youtube video. I will admit that I haven&#039;t kept the reagent in the fridge, but it was stored in a cool dark place. The reagent was also sealed. I have used it once before this test where I found out I was sold bk-MDMA. I really hope I made the mistake of accepting erroneous results. I use reagents kits a lot in hobby of mine; they&#039;re famously imprecise but reliable to see ranges.&nbsp; Usually the reagents have an expiration date of a year. If I truly am wrong, my bad, I wasn&#039;t trying to discredit any vendor intentionally. I tested my current reagent batch with sugar...it turned brown instantly, this appears to mean that kit is borderline expired from the bluelight.ru( would like to see references) .I will pick up some aspirin later today.

I was hoping that with the scrutiny and clear experience of many users on the SR things would be somewhat different than the street.I received kind of a dick message from Aidoneus upon questioning his purity.We will see what that batch tests out as. One thing which concerns me is the response, when you question someone directly, generally them taking offense is a sign of alarm. Especially when the reagent test reacts positively to 5-MeO-AMT...A very similar experience to MDMA, but way more toxic/dangerous.

				I know, I feel like a complete asshole now. I just wanted to put things out into the open. When buying chemicals in person or&nbsp; from an acquaintance there is a degree of accountability. For instance, if I ever run into the guy who sold me the RC down in Miami, which is quite possible considering he &quot;promotes&quot; for a popular club within a very large city, I will beat the living shit out of him..I honestly had no idea that the Marquis reagent would spoil so quickly. From now on, I will be buying new kits every few months. I do not consumer MDMA frequently, but it is never a bad idea to double check. Hopefully both MDUK and Aidoneus will forgive me&nbsp; ???

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Really pissed off because I specifically told the vendor I have test kits and that I do not want any research chemicals. I am not an idiot, I have a science degree affording my competency in chemistry etc..<br /><br />Update: my second &quot;MDMA&quot; order also tested positive for AMT(Brown Marquis reaction) NO MDMA....is there really pure MDMA on the road? or is it all just bunk..Looks like I am going to have to play chemist with some safrole...

				All chemicals have their inherent dangers. My use of the improper nomenclature was used to describe the substances other than MDMA. My point was the danger in the unknown substance is typically from a person&#039;s mental reaction or place of consumption( set and setting) not necessarily in the neurological or biological toxicity.I wouldn&#039;t want to consume a strong hallucinogen within a nightclub or outdoor festival. Maybe at home, when I know for sure the expected effects. When I knowingly consume MDMA, I can practice the proper harm reduction strategies to minimize the deleterious effects.

				I would also like to add an apology. I contributed to the thread stating that I have had marquis work for well over 2 years, so I figured the stuff sent was something else, as for my experience with testing. I guess some test kits last longer than others. Glad to hear that the new test kit stated positive results.

				I loved the civility on this board. And I&#039;m also glad that the MDUK and Adoneius (both of which I looked at) ended up to be good vendors. Overall, glad I read the thread.

				Damn I didn&#039;t realize that many people were still reading this thread.....Updated the main page...Remember kids: your MDMA testing reagents will expire within 3-6 months. Order way, both of the vendors&#039; products are legit. FYI in the states we purchase the reagent in batches not the sealed EZ tests.Now that I cared to look up the actual contents of the reagents, I will be making my own as needed&nbsp; ;)

				can&#039;t wait to try legit molly on here, it will probably be better than the first time I ever rolled! I&#039;m wanting to buy a live peyote cactus too, but doing so would be rather pointless other than to repopulate the species, or for the pure novelty of it, considering you can get highly pure mescaline here.

				How many of you would test a molly that comes from a reputable seller like perhaps a frankmatthews or subtickle?
