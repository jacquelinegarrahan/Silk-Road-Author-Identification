				Right, I gobbled down some shrooms a while ago and questions about the universe kept spiraling into my head about why are humans on earth, like whats our purpose? And another was what are we building towards, I mean every day we come up with better and better technology. I may of just been fucked up, but I still cant think of any answers haha. Input please!
