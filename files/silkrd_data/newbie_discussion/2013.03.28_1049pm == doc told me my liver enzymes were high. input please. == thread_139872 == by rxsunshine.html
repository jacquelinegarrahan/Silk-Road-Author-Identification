				i just came home from the doc and he said my enzyme levels were very high. one was 150 and the other 350. he drew blood to be checked for hep c. now im freaking out bc i asked him if it was life threatening and he was like, &quot;ehh, we&#039;re gonna run a few tests....&quot;, but he didnt asnwer me. i looked online and saw some incidents where ppl levels were in the thousands. like 5k+.

				This can be due to alcohol and medicine and other drugs ofcourse.<br /><br />Don&#039;t freak out yet. Try to search for the cause. Which ones are elevated? ALAT? ASAT? GAMMA-GT?<br /><br />Stay off (some) drugs and alcohol for a month. To see what is the cause.<br />And eat &quot;maria distel&quot;. It&#039;s homeopathic but it made this monkey amaze doctors. They were like.. huh ... 0_o!<br />300 is a lot though, so eat less poisonous bananas and do not freak out!<br />Checking for hep c is standard procedure but you probably don&#039;t have it. Or do you share needles and stuff?<br /><br />Just stay off one or more shit for about 1-2 months and let the doctor re-check.<br />If you drink daily then stop doing that. If you take meds then discuss that with your doc.<br /><br />Good luck!

				thanks for the info friends. i use to be a needle user and have safely shared needles before but this was ten years ago. by safely, i mean bleaching them. i know that was stupid and may have caused me damage and i havent done that in ten years. but ab 7 years ago, a doc told me that i had been exposed to hep c but didnt tell me whether i had it or not. hopefully i dont have it, fingers crossed. i use drugs on occasion like twice a month maybe three times. these drugs being, adderall ab once a month. you know, for a long speedy night with the wifey, i drink ab twice a week and trip ab once a month. i did however roll on pure mdma ab 3 days before my blood work. this may have elevated them some.<br />i was doing some research and saw where some ppl with liver failure levels were like 7500 and 12500. those numbers made me feel a little better. as far as which enzymes, i think they were alat and gamma gt but not sure. seems like i remember him saying that though

				Drink plenty of water, eat high fiber complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables. Avoid refined carbohydrates such as white bread, sugar, chips potatoes. Reduce the consumption of meat and dairy products. Eat more often vegetables, beans, whole wheats, fruits, vegetables. This will reduce wear on your liver. Enzymes should improve within two to three months, which will also contribute to heart and kidney function.

				The reason for this is refined carbohydrates cause an increase in blood sugar, which means more work for your liver to process. The less work your liver has to do the most can work on cleaning itself. Be careful and take care of your body.
