				Ok so I understand how to obtain bitcoins, but I&#039;m confused as to where to go from there. Everyone is saying you need to transfer them into your SR wallet with the address next to your account, but I see now address next to mine. How exactly is that done? I have a blockchain wallet with an address, but what do I do with that address? I&#039;m sorry if this has been asked already, but I thought I had this down but now I feel like I just confused myself more.

				I&#039;m not sure exactly what information you&#039;re missing. When you buy your bitcoins they will have to be sent to a wallet (which can just be on a website, or can be on your computer) which has an address where they can stay. Your SR account has its own wallet with its own address, which can be found at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account or by clicking &quot;account&quot; at the top of the screen. If your BTC is in another wallet after you buy them, you&#039;ll have to hit withdraw on whatever site they&#039;re on and put in that bolded number on SR. When you&#039;re sending them, you don&#039;t have to worry about the address of the wallet they&#039;re already in, but only the number you&#039;re sending them to.
