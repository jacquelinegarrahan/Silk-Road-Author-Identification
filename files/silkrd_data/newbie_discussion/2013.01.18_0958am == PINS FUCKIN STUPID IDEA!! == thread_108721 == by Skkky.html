				So I&#039;ve read every review I could get my hands on before adding my BC and trying to make a purchase and NON OF THEM mention this stupid PIN..&nbsp; Why can&#039;t it just be your log in password or something simple like that? I don&#039;t even remember the site asking me to create or give me one.&nbsp; Well I used up my attempts to make a purchase and have to to wait about another week before I can spend MY BC!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Something so important should be in big red letters starting with IMPORTANT INFO, PINS.&nbsp; or something like that.

				The PIN is there for your protection - it adds an extra layer of security, so if someone got into your account, they couldn&#039;t spend your bitcoin without the PIN. When you are signing up, it states clearly in italics not to forget your PIN. Maybe you should have been more observant when you were signing up. Everyone is responsible for their own actions...just saying ;)

Online banking now usually requires you to enter your customer code, type a pin on a virtual keypad, and confirm whatever transaction you want to do by typing a confirmation code sent on your email or on mobile phone.

				The security of a pin comes in handy when dealing with phishing websites. A phishing website would be set up to mimic the login page of SR so it would be very easy for them to collect unknowing user&#039;s username and password. The security comes in when they try to withdraw your bitcoins to their address they wont be able to without knowing your pin.<br /><br />Phishers know this is the case which is why they ask for your pin on their fake login page.<br /><br />If SR ever asks you to for a pin at login, check the URL to make sure you&#039;re on the real SR.<br /><br />remember... silkroad<br />vb5<br />piz3r<br />.onion...if you can remember that you are in good shape to not get scammed.

It&#039;s called two-factor security. A password (something you know) and a PIN (something else you know) isn&#039;t two-factor security so that&#039;s where the difference lies.<br /><br />If someone can hack the db to get your password, they can hack it to get your pin. Hell, with only 10000 possible combinations, a modern CPU could work out a PIN in a fraction of a second, if it&#039;s even been hashed in the first place.<br />If they can beat you until you tell them your password, they can beat you until you also tell them your PIN.<br />If they can sneak up on your machine once you&#039;re logged in and try to make an order, but not knowing your PIN would have stopped them, then requiring your password to make an order/transfer and them not knowing your password would also have stopped them.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you re-used the same login and password on these forums as you did your SR account (you didn&#039;t, did you?) then it at least stops a malicious forum operator or forum security breach from stealing all your bitcoins. Unless you used 1234 for your pin (you didn&#039;t, did you?).

				There is a plethora of threads like this in the rest of the forum.&nbsp; The pin was created FOR YOU so your btc aren&#039;t stolen and nobody else makes a purchase with your account.&nbsp; It kinda sucks when you don&#039;t remember it because it can be super inconvenient, but it&#039;s what we have and it actually works very well for it&#039;s purpose.

				Bottom line is having the PIN has protected at least some users against having their funds stolen and this thread is not likely to change the policy.<br /><br />When you set your PIN there was a message along the lines of &quot;Do not forget this.&quot;&nbsp; If you can&#039;t manage to remember or securely store your PIN then you need a wait a few days.<br /><br />The next challenge some users have after the PIN is getting their address right.&nbsp; It amazes me how often users get that wrong.

				There have been increasing reports of people NOT being prompted to make a pin when they create their account.&nbsp; Honestly, it doesn&#039;t surprise me.&nbsp; Yeah, it IS super inconvenient. Yes, I&#039;ve forgotten my pin once.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly though, you&#039;ve gone your whole life without using the SR.&nbsp; Waiting another week for your pin isn&#039;t going to kill you.

				Suavee.. Just stumbled upon your thread here.<br /><br />We feel for you bro.<br /><br />Just remind us on your order, and we will honor the promotion. Maybe even throw a goodie in ur pack for ya bro.<br /><br />We understand how frustrating that might be and to start a new account a lose your stats would be a pain in the ass.<br /><br />They should come up with three questions and answers to comfirm for lost pin IMO (like many clearnet sites do) is there any problem with security issues on that?<br /><br />There should be a fairly painless way to prove your (anonymous) identity on here AKA verifying that you are the rightful owner of that acct etc.<br /><br />Also if an account such as our (knock on wood) got hacked we should be able to prove that it is ours (via forums etc.) via a few security questions to take back control and lock all BTC in acct and escrow.<br /><br />Y&#039;all following me?<br /><br />NWD

				Just a reminder when you create an account<br /><br />It asks for a username<br /><br />it asks for a pass phrase<br />it ask you to retype to confirm<br /><br />it asks for a pin<br />It ask you to retype to confirm<br /><br />it then says<br />DO NOT forget your PIN!<br /><br />You then select locating <br />type captcha<br />and your done<br /><br /><br /><br />For people forgetting the pin don&#039;t blame anyone but the person in the mirror.<br /><br />I have read many posts in the past about getting hacked and losing access to there account for a period of time but not to there losing the BTC as the PIN stops hackers from accessing this part of your account.

				First of all i dont think anyone is trying to blame someone for their pin not working, They just want a solution on how to fix it asap as they have btc&#039;s in the account and dont want to lose them obviously. Well that&#039;s my situation anyway. <br />I have emailed SR support but no reply yet, Will just have to wait till tomorrow i think. <br />Can anyone get me a password reset link or do they send you it?&nbsp; <br />What do i do now?<br /><br />This is my situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114140.msg775131#msg775131<br />Cheers all
