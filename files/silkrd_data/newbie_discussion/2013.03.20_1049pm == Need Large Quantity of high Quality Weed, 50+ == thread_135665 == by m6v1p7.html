				If you have the means to move 50 things, and are looking for a new, i imagine, more cost efficient connect, than it would only make sense to assume that you either have at any given time, or can find the means to produce enough money to get this kind of connect the proper way. Which would be taking 10 grand, flying out to cali for a week or 2, hit the local bars and start small. Develop a re pour with some local growers or dealers. Get a few z&#039;s, then a qp, then a whole one..so on and so forth. All the while sending it back to your self.<br /><br />&nbsp;With in no more than 10 days time, if your real with it, you will have your 50 pack connect, and soon there after..w.e your network can demand.

				That is a very ideal approach that I would love to take. But right now life is a bit too busy whether it be personal or business. I am not quite comfortable leaving a business behind for a week or two in hopes that a friend can be trusted enough to keep it moving as I would like. So instead of spending that 10 grand you can&#039;t blame me for posting on here in hopes that someone like yourself can point me in the right direction, but i know trust works both ways so I can&#039;t blame you if you don&#039;t. Anyways I&#039;m not quite Boston George yet, but I&#039;m not hesitant to take it there ;-)

				I can contract out work, but at the cost of anonymity. We need to do some really good drugs together before I can begin production. Apalachian Trail? Rockies? Cali Redwoods? Camping trip to get to know each other, or maybe sailing.<br /><br />Before I contract out big jobs, I like to spend time in a survival-testing environment to make sure we are on the same level. Sailing for 10+ days to the middle of an ocean is a great way to get to know each other and how reliable one can be under stress, in addition to verifying intelligence and patience.
