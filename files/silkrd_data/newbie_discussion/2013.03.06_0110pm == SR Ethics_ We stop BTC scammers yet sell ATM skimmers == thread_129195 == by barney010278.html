				I noticed that SR Digital section is selling ATM Skimmers<br /><br />quote from sellers site<br />&quot;works if they leave the master password set to default, but if u find one sucker u can exploit the shit out of it&quot;.<br /><br />Not only is it wrong, would it encourage big banks with all their money to come after sites like SR?

				These are a sham, unless you got the rest of the gear to make it work.&nbsp; <br />They&#039;ve been around for years.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;How about the potassium cyanide ?&nbsp; It&#039;s lists under &#039; other&#039;<br />Putting that Into an envelope and mailing it through the system is bound to get somebody scared.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Holy fuck the anthrax scare a while back was probably just some bloke sending a sample to someone in an envelope in the mail.&nbsp; It ripped open and they tested the white powder inside and the world freaked out. <br /><br />Card skimmers don&#039;t work BTW with any card with a chip in it .&nbsp; So, most ATM cards are chipped and the bank has it all taken care of already .&nbsp; This is why they are selling these skimmers here. -&gt; Drug induced retard teenage-wanna-be-hackers are going to buy these thinking they will be easy.&nbsp; Maybe in some 3rd world country where there are no chipped cards. Hahaha&nbsp; &nbsp;These skimmers are no more good. Hey are unloading them here .&nbsp; To suckers.<br /><br />They used to be for sale o. The clear net .&nbsp; They are NOT illegal.&nbsp; They are just card readers.&nbsp; Tiny card readers that store data on a little memory.&nbsp; There are other legit applications for this device such as hotel room doors and warehouses .&nbsp; Look into it .&nbsp; They are still on the clear net and perfectly legal to buy.&nbsp; Yo can also buy the card making machines too.&nbsp; Most hotels have one to make new room keys and membership cards.&nbsp; It&#039;s no big deal to have one and print up a few thousand credit cards .&nbsp; &nbsp; BUT!!! No chips, or holograms . <br /><br />Take care.<br /><br /><br />
