				http://sealswithclubs.eu - paying 10 bitcoins to someone who teaches me how to use multiple accounts at the same table.<br />I don&#039;t have any knowledge with this and if someone can teach me how to do it I&#039;ll instantly send them 10 bitcoins.<br />Let me know - don&#039;t waste your time scamming me, I won&#039;t send first.. But if you figure it out and I verify it works I&#039;ll send ya the coins!

				You don&#039;t need to pay me for this, but if you mean logging into SR or SR Forums multiple times, the easiest and most straightforward method to do this should be to copy and paste the folder the Tor Browser Bundle resides in, and rename those folders, then launch each copy of the Tor Browser Bundle individually. Now that you have X numbers of TBB open, you can log in to different SR accounts on each copy.<br /><br />I have not tested this, but it should work.

Maybe different cookies, but that&#039;s about it... and it would seem rather silly if SWC doesn&#039;t also check for multiple sessions from a single IP.
