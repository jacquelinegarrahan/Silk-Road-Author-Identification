				Hello SR! Long time lurker, first time poster here. We&#039;re stuck in the n00b forum until we get 50 posts, so please do leave a comment, ask questions, or let&#039;s just talk about what&#039;s on your mind :) For now, here&#039;s the description from our vendor page (found at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e1702e68e2)<br /><br />We&#039;re a small operation that loves crypto and quality cannabis, and decided to merge these passions into a secure, professional business here on the Silk Road.<br /><br />Products For Sale<br /><br />We carry Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid cannabis products including:<br /><br />- Flowers<br />- Concentrates<br />- Trim<br />- Pre-rolled joints<br />- Seeds **coming soon**<br /><br />As well as accessories such as:<br /><br />- Functional Glass Art (dry and wet pieces)<br />- Grinders<br />- Containers<br /><br />And if you want anything cannabis-related that we don&#039;t offer, send a PM and we&#039;ll create a private listing for you after we find the item within our network of merchants.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Right now we&#039;re trying to liquidate a stash of 25-C + 25-I psychedelics we have, and then we&#039;ll be listing all of our cannabis products next week (the plan was to have them listed before 4/20, but life doesn&#039;t always work out as planned. Still need to take dank pictures and let the flowers cure a bit longer). We will be offering competitive pricing, top-notch shipping techniques, and lots of love for the Silk Road, which we will be vending through exclusively because DPR is just that awesome!

As we gain confidence in our shipping methods with a few dozen successful deliveries, we may open this up as an option. We just want to make sure our customers stay safe and will not ship international until 100% confident it will make it over the border undetected. Any info on how to do this safely could help expedite this tho :) To answer your second question, we will be offering bubble hash concentrates to start and will eventually be adding dry kief and wax.

				SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT<br />We now have an ongoing promo special to encourage buyers to leave feedback. After placing your order, you will receive a private message with two codes: one to leave in the Silk Road market vendor feedback, and one to leave in a review on the Silk Road forum in our thread located right here until we get 50 posts and can leave the newbie forum. Each code will earn you 5% off your next order, so if you leave feedback both in the marketplace and on the forum and use each code you can earn up to 10% off your next order. You have to use the codes to get the discount! After receiving your items and redeeming your codes, when you place your next order just type in the address box when you&#039;re checking out that you are redeeming your discount and link to where you left the codes if possible (ie link to a forum post or item feedback in the marketplace where it shows your code). We don&#039;t require positive feedback when you&#039;re redeeming your codes, just honest feedback to help out any future buyers who are interested in trying our products. We look forward to doing business, thanks for stopping by!
