				Okay so i&#039;m new to vending on SR, but not new to SR at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; If everyone that vending was made to be a buyer for at least 60 days this would be a better place,&nbsp; but that is unrealistic.&nbsp; &nbsp;So as a new vendor I guess you are a target for some types of scamming.&nbsp; Really though, this one was so funny...&nbsp; and is ongoing so I thoght I would post or thread thus far.&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in mind I have a listing for methylone caps.&nbsp; They are 5 bucks each.&nbsp; Mainly because I want people to try them and build some feedback, but also to attract some bulk inquiries.&nbsp; But in the end, they are 5 fucking dollars.&nbsp; So I get this PM today....<br />______________________________________________<br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I want to order 20 of the 250mg.BK-MDMA Capsules you have because the price can&#039;t be beat!! I CAN NOT WAIT to try this BK-MDMA the way it is described in your feedback I will be only getting my Methylone from you now most likely. I would like to order ASAP though!! I just, and I know u don&#039;t want to hear this as a vendor cuz I know that everyone is trying to scam you and then not order, am almost exactly $8 or $9 shy from ordering right now and that IS THE TRUTH!!! It is just the btc dropping like $30+ per coin in the last 2-3days. Sorry man, and if you can&#039;t help me I will try my hardest to find the small amount of BTC, [but I really doubt I can], so I can order the Methylone before btc drops anymore. Thanks and I CAN NOT WAIT TO TRY THIS BK-MDMA the way ur customers desribed it!!!!!! Please PM me back man as soon as you can. Thank You so much if you can PLEASE help so I can do a lot of this BK-MDMA!!!<br /><br /><br />his royal highness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />cool. sounds good to me.<br />yeah, i&#039;m hedged so luckily whatever you pay it will be locked in at that rate until you finalize. which is good for me, because man it is going down quickly.<br />ready to go when you are, so we&#039;ll talk to you soon.<br />HRH<br /><br /><br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />waiting for you to send the btc then I will order ASAP<br /><br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />ok if it sounds good then just send the $6 to me in btc, which is like 0.1btc. Thaks.<br /><br />his royal highness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />easier, if you just buy 19 and then i&#039;ll include 20 anyway :)<br /><br />nbeaupre<br />Please just send the btc so i can order 20 plus the free 4caps. I want to order all 20 so it shows on my order history cuz a lot of people before this 2 months ago didn&#039;t receive but lately they have. Please send the $6 in btc which is like 0.09btc or like 0.1btc, then I can order ASAP<br /><br /><br />his royal highness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />your order/purchase history will still show you bought 95USD worth of product, instead of $100 worth of product. i guess i don&#039;t see the difference. but is a personal policy not to send out btc of this account for any reason. i would instead do a custom listing, but in this case that isn&#039;t even necessary. just put in an order for 19, and i&#039;ll make sure you get 24.<br /><br /><br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />OK I can see you do not trust me. hopefully in the future sometime I will want to order again. I have perfect stats.

				with the payoff for him only being 6 dollars, you&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be worth the time.&nbsp; maybe it is just a personal satisfaction of getting that two bit shit to work.&nbsp; or people paying him 6 dollars to go away.
