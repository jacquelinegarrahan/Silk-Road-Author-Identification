				hey,<br />i havent placed an order yet, though would be thankful if you could help me out with this question.<br />here where i live (ger via dhl), it is common to sign when you get a package. So i dont understand your warnings concerning NEVER signing something.<br />How can i get the package then? Or do i heavily misunderstand something?<br />merci

				It is more of an issue in the US when the postal service is used, not as much the private companies like DHL and FedEx...signing for a package is a method used by law enforcement to get the person to prove acceptance of an illegal substance...vendors almost always send via methods that do not require signatures, so usually everyone is informed to NOT answer the door if a package has arrived.&nbsp; Just let them leave it at the door.&nbsp; If you are unsure, you should ask the vendor if they sent it requiring a signature.&nbsp; Most vendors are happy to help you out and they know all about how things get delivered in many countries.<br /><br />Best of luck to you!

				&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Think of it this way you are putting your trust into a vendor to send you X in the post by discreet methods, did you request signed for postage when ordering?, you never know it might of been included, my self i would sign for it or go pick it up, and if ever questioned i would say must of been a address error and then say fuck all else, it will have to be the LE or who ever to prove it, not you! <br />so the less you say the less they would have to work on. <br /><br />People get stuff in the post every day they did not order its a common issue, I seen a program other day on how the bastards treat your mail and packages, half of them should Olympians&nbsp; the distance that they can throw stuff.

				^^ what he said.<br /><br />My mother-in-law was a postmaster for USPS for a long time. I asked her advice about the things I&#039;m ordering. Basically she said ignorance is bliss. <br /><br />A package arriving at your door is essentially hearsay, until you sign for it. Once you sign for it, you are taking responsibility for its packaging. Usually, a package is simply confiscated, but once in a while, they will contact the appropriate authorities (2nd, 3rd questionable package heading to that address), and continue shipping. And then when you sign for it, they pounce, because it shows intent and knowledge.<br /><br />Neither the post office nor authorities can reasonably assume that the recipient is aware that a package is in transit, nor can they assume the recipient is aware of its contents.

				I think it is also most for the us <br />Over here if you ordered something under your name and address if you didn&#039;t sign for it would seem completely odd and different to the postman therefore more suspicious that&#039;s just me tho if your going to get raided I think it will happen regardless if you sign for that package or not just make sure your house is always clean and there is no other evidence anywhere I always go on the assumption that the package is going to be found

				maybe some european folk can help out?<br /><br />Over here they won&#039;t give you the package, besides you sign. <br />The other case is, they drop it at a neighbours place, a packstation (where most vendors dont send anymore) or the next postal shop.<br /><br />Is this the way i should handle it? just pick it up there and ignore the man, when i am at home?

				well from where I&#039;m from if a package is sent with Tracking then you have to sign for it to claim it,thats how it works e.g. DHL,etc..<br />if not then don&#039;t sign for it,it should be delivered in your mail-box<br />
