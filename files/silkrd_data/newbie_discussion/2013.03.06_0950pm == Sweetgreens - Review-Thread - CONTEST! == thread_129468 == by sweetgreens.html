				I am very pleased with this seller for giving me the chance to try this lovely green!<br />The package came safe and fast like 3 days to the UK!<br />The weed had a lovely color well dry and cured with good taste and pleasant smell.<br />Got me with a nice stoned buzz :)<br />Not in a very big bud cause it was only a sample, but nice little small buds;) i think it may be white widow or similar strain.<br />Being a a smoker for more then 20 years this small sample only made me droll for more :)<br />I m already a Sweetgreens fan and once i get a chance will get me some more of this sweetness:) <br /><br />Thank You Sweetgreens

				I&#039;ve got a 0.5g&nbsp; sample of weed from sweetgreens<br />Okay so let&#039;s start:<br /><br />Communication: Just excelent, fast reply everytime and friendly comunication. 6/5<br /><br />Shipping: Under 24h, basically shipped next day and fast delivery (2days)!<br /><br />Package: Double vacuum 1x see-thought and 1x black one. Didn&#039;t notice any smell. Not going into more details. 5/5.<br /><br />Product: Few small buds and mostly really crushed but you could see that it&#039;s crushed bud with crystals of some nice indoor. Packed a bong, smoke wasn&#039;t so hard on lungs and made me cought a bit but not that harsh cought, it was just like i wanted to cought.<br /><br />High was sativa at 1st but only like first 5-10 minutes then it went into fine indica.<br />Otherwise i rate this whole deal as good one, just thought that it will not be crushed, but well again it was only SAMPLE and also small one.<br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br />//EDIT: Wanted to add BB code but well..

				So I am doing my review, as I was asked by sweetgreens to do so :)<br />I ordered a free sample of .5g<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Product: 3,5/5 (The weed was a very small bud and the rest was leaves and stems. Did not look <br />very delicious. Tried the weed first with my (of course cleaned) bong. Smoke was a bit harsh, <br />but not too much. Taste was sweet with a little note of bitter. The high was definately indica-dominant, <br />but did not last longer than 2 hours.&nbsp; The rest of the bud went in a spliff, mixed 50/50 with tobacco. The <br />smoke in the joint was similar harsh like in the bong, the taste was more sweet. All in All I would say <br />this is average quality weed, gets you high, no doubt but nothing special, no A+++, but this is my opinion, <br />I am looking on SR for top notch stuff, medical grade.)<br /><br />Package: 4/5 (I was one of the first who received stuff from sweetgreens. I heard it got already improved. <br />Was a legit letter, but it was easy to feel structure of bud from outside. Did not smell. Did not leak, prefect <br />sealed)<br /><br />Service: 5/5 (does free samples and contests, had good communication, communication stopped <br />when I dropped my opinion about the quality, it was very fast in transit, and 1 or 2 days after <br />delivered to a neighbouring country )<br /><br />sweetgreens is a legit vendor, 100% trustworthy, communicates clear and is supportive and active<br />in the forums (as you can see :D ). Only the current batch of weed is not for my liking.<br />So guys and gals of SR feel free to try out the products and services of sweetgreens!!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />edit: &quot;Only the current batch of weed is not for my liking.&quot; -&gt; sweetgreens told me that there is a new batch available now.&nbsp; I have not tested the new one, but maybe another one will review it here :)<br /><br />one love<br />

				Hello all together,<br />i was asked by Sweetgreens to write something on this forum because of the contest.<br />First, I want to say that I am not smoking weed very much, so I have no tolerance and I only enjoy it one or two times per month.<br />Because of some trouble in my job I decided to order some weed for feeling better and to relax. I ordered 1g of the very high quality Indoor Weed.<br />The weed arrived within one day after it was marked in transit( and it was marked in transit within 24 hours). This is very very fast, I never had such a fast experience. This was a domestic order. But my other experiences with other drug deliverys that were domestic, were not so good as this one. This is the only seller where the product arrived so fast. So, this would be the first positive reason to do business with Sweetgreens again.<br />The product was packed in two vacuum-sealed bags, very professional. When the letter was not opened, I didn`t smell anything of the weed, so it is very secure to order from this seller.<br />Then I tested it and I must say. great! My troubles were far away and the feeling was nearly like flying and feeling very well. I lay on the bed, and the bad thoughts that I had before were far far away. I really enjoyed this feeling and it was making my day, the problems I had seemed to be subsidiary, only the postive feelings came through. I heard music and relaxed. Later I got hungry and everything tasted very good. In the evening I was sleeping like a baby and had enjoyable dreams. Even at the next morning I was feeling good and happy. So I smoked the next day again, and the same happened at the day before. I am really grateful about this weed and will definitely order again! When you want to escape from bad feelings and from the daily routine I only can recommend this weed. <br />The price is also very good!<br />All in all I am very satisfied with Sweetgreens and I hope to do business with them again in the future. I hope they will stay a long time on silkroad.<br />Because of this positive experience I got a fan of this really nice guys!<br />Thanx Sweetgreens<br />Greetings<br />miesling
