				I looked around and couldnt find a newbie thread for this guy so I decided to start one.<br />I ordered from this fella on a friday.&nbsp; It showed on that monday... Mail doesnt even run on sundays, that goes to show you how dedicated this guy is to getting his shit to his customers. Here&#039;s the break down:<br />1. shipping- Fastest I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; I was pleasantly suprised, I almost shit my pants at the speed. he gets an 5 out of 5<br />2. stealth-Good shit. Mailman is not going to fuck with your shit.&nbsp; It blends right in. Wont go into too much detail but its enough for domestic. 5 out of 5<br />3. communication.&nbsp; I messaged Clearance before making my order, and he replied within a few hours(and it wasnt during peak hours), so that goes to show he checks his shit often.&nbsp; He was extremely pleasing to speak with, and he did not have a problem with me starting a review thread for him. I&#039;m sure if I messaged him now he&#039;d still be cool. 5 out of 5<br />4.product. I just got it, wont be able to test until the weekend, but it smells and looks beautiful.&nbsp; Its a little like an off white sand with some crystals in it. On par with some Supertrips shit.&nbsp; As they say if it walks and talks like a duck...must be a duck.&nbsp; Anyway, I will update quality after the weekend.&nbsp; Also, weighed a little over what I ordered. So just know you are in good hands. _ out of 5(will fill in blank soon).<br /><br />Be sure to post your reviews here if you cannot post in the big-boy boards yet. <br />Thanks again Clearance.

				I would like to add to this, Clearance is the first domestic mdma vendor i&#039;ve used and i have been so happy with his service.<br />Great prices, fast shipping, good communication, great stealth (shipped overnight), and amazing mdma<br />marquis test went straight to black with the littlest sample, been making 150mg caps and feeling amazing<br />can&#039;t recommend this guy enough
