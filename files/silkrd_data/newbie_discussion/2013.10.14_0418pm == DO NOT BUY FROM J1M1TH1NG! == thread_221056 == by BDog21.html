				I got ripped off by j1m1th1ing about 2-3 weeks before sr shut down, i came to him asking him to EXPRESS me some apvp and he said he would express it that day if i got him a working tracking number showing i sent him some of my etizolam, sent him the tracking number that day and didnt hear anything back...few days went by with no response to multiple messages...then he responds with how he has &quot;17.4 million orders per day and 875 billion messages&quot; or whatever, BULLSHIT j1m1th1ng get over your fucking self i know damn well, as well as everybody else, that you are not NEARLY as busy as you make it seem. i understand you are busy, but come on, your exaggerating is way too excessive. now its been like a month and a half or 2 hell i dont even know anymore and ive sent multiple messages here on sr forums as well as tried everything else i can to get ahold of him with no response.....DO NOT BUY FROM J1M1 HE IS TURNING INTO A SCAMMER AND WILL TAKE YOU FOR YOUR MONEY!!1

				To BDog21:<br /><br />Dude, are you clueless? Have you noticed that SR has been shut down for two weeks and that no one is buying anything from anyone!?!?<br /><br />Your rant about j1m1th1ing is BS. Your whole story is fishy. I found that j1m1th1ing was an outstanding vendor. His worst fault was in being slow to respond to some orders. I think that your story is unbelievable.

				No, im not clueless. Yes, duh, sr has been shut down, that does not mean that people are not buying things from him through other means..Apparently you dont realize that he used to sell publicly on research chem forums, im sure some people still have his contact info from that, SR is not the ONLY place to buy stuff online....<br /><br />and how is my story fishy? what about it seems fishy? i am also a vendor, and was trading him some etizolam for a-pvp because i was out...and your correct he WAS a good vendor, up untill recently he DID rip me off, if i could get to my messages on sr i would prove it but i obviously cant. Which is why im making this post, beause he USED to be a great vendor, but has turned scammer apparently

				You are entitled to your view. I myself have had only good outcomes from doing business with j1m1th1ing.<br /><br />I guess what seems fishy is his otherwise good track record. You yourself were apparently pleased with him until recently. It&#039;s too bad you could not have cleared this up before SR went down, but I suppose you feel the same way. Again, you are entitled to your opinion.
