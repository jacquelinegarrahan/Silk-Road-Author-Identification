				Well, I&#039;m a 25 year old organic chemist. I graduated with my PhD last year and I&#039;m having trouble finding good work. I&#039;ve worked at this dead-end job for almost a year now, and the pay is miniscule. It&#039;s nothing.<br /><br />But really, I&#039;ve been straight edge my entire life. I desperately want to build a lab, but I don&#039;t have very much by the way of funds. I also have no idea where a good location would be. I&#039;d likely need to get a cheap house with a nice basement. <br /><br />I&#039;m very efficient and good at what I do, I just am not a &quot;criminal mastermind&quot;. I don&#039;t know how to work the underground marketplace. Does anyone have any advice on how I should start out? I want to start a huge LSD lab, yet I likely won&#039;t start with that, but DMT. I need to build funds to actually buy a more professional lab for LSD production. Purification is never a problem as I do have access to a professional lab, however, not that I can synthesize illict drugs in, just chromatography and other sterilization methods (autoclave, etc).<br /><br />Any ideas? I figure this is the best place to begin. I have no partners, yet I could involve a family member once I have my lab built.

				I need something a lot less obvious than that. I don&#039;t want to drive out into the middle of nowhere to synthesize my chemicals. I can do it from home with proper filtraton.

				Do the proper reading. No one is going to spoon-feed you. I know this is a typical forum-goer response to a lot of things, but I think this type of response is important because it weeds out those who truly are not dedicated to the trade (and therefore should not waste their time with a half-assed pursuit that could potentially prove disastrous). You&#039;ve already shot yourself in the foot posting on an online forum for the world to see. No one here is going to help you; there are maybe a two-three people here who have done synths (or so they say), and they have no reason to post sensitive info on a public board. Definitely do not involve any other human beings in your activities, if you value your freedom. Other than that, read, read, read. You would be surprised how many things an uneducated person could do when setting up even a small clandestine lab that could land her in the Club.

				this might give you an idea - look for an old chicken farm. Back in the 70s i bought a small 15 acre farm with a shit house (siding was roof shingles made to look like brick) but it had a huge chicken barn - about 150 ft long X 25 ft wide, with full electric svc (there were huge electric radiant ceiling heaters, so the place was already wired with decent svc.<br /><br />I ended up moving up to canada for a few years and gave it to a realtor to rent for me - found out when i got back, some kids had rented it, and boarded up the huge chicken coop - chicken coop from about 4 ft off the ground up to about 8&#039; ft mark was just chicken wire for ventilation. Anyway they were growing maryjane, industrial scale. The problem, and their stupidty, they might as well have put up a sign saying look at me - they put a huge gate on the driveway with &quot;NO TRESPASSING&quot; signs on it, and had german shepherds patrolling the property&nbsp; - they got bustef. Point of story is blend in, neighbors notice odd activity.<br /><br />Reason you&#039;ll stand a good chance to find one - i had looked into raising chickens&nbsp; commercially- everything is done under contract with one of the big chicken processors, like perdue - and they fuck you in the ass bad - you agree to buy the feed from them, price on feed will fluctuate, and agree to sell them the meat on a pre-agreed on price. If feed price, utility costs go up you&#039;re screwed - if chickens get infected with whatever bird flu strain, they have to be destroyed. Long and short of it, there are a lot of small chicken farms that go under<br /><br />if it helps

				First off, just because someone is a PhD doesn&#039;t mean they understand the criminal underworld. YOU guys do.<br /><br />Do I need synthesis tips?

And yes, the domestic LSD market is dying. It&#039;s a sad thing, truly. I could do mescaline, but I wouldn&#039;t be able to get nearly as much of it. My best bet is either DMT, GBL -&gt; GHB, or MDMA. DMT will be the easiest for me, as the supply of GBL on Silk Road seems to be pretty scarce. MDMA will be next as I have ready access to the precursors, but it&#039;s still a harder synthesis to do without a proper lab. Can be done, obviously, as it&#039;s an easy synthesis in general, but I&#039;m sure you know where I&#039;m coming from.

				no man, you need to get a firm of fumigators. while they have the house tented and are fumigating the place, you set up a smaller tent inside the tent and cook your shit up in there. to be really badass, take one of the younger fumigators on a robbery to get some chemical precursor that you need and get him to shoot some innocent kid while you&#039;re at it.

				Start small dude. Don&#039;t even start with your plan. Learn with small scale first and lower grade drugs. You WILL make mistakes. Have you ever done anything and not made a mistake? It rarely happens. So get busted on little things first...once you&#039;ve wised up....then maybe...

				This sort of question always poses a bit of a dilemma for me. I mean,&nbsp; from the Harm Reduction perspective, which is how I tend to judge these things now, not in terms of morals and all that crap, should one give a truthful answer or just avoid the issue and shut up.<br />Anyway, who cares what I think? If people are going to do this sort of thing, they need to know what they are getting themselves into and the very &quot;heavy&quot; things that can go wrong. I think it better to be informed than misinformed.<br /><br />Have you read any of the excellent books available on SR books?&nbsp; This is a good one:<br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1663f3806a<br /><br />and so is this: Building a Drug Lab &amp; Essential Chemistry<br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/825732f9a2<br /><br />Hope this helps - one way or another.

				First consideration is location. You DON&#039;T want nosy neighbors that you have to explain things to. The more distance between you and the next guy will guarantee your success. I&#039;d choose a sparsly populated state where being a loner is considered normal. Like New Mexico, the Dakotas, Wyoming. I WOULDN&#039;T do it in a house, in a neighborhood, in a populated city. Someone WILL get nosy and that&#039;s when the shit&#039;ll hit the fan. Not even a rural neighborhood would work. They&#039;re always getting busted around where I live, so take if from me, a farm setting is where it&#039;s at. Everyone&#039;s on this &quot;look out for your neighbor&quot; kick that&#039;s gotten downright sickening. I&#039;d get chem&#039;s delivered several hundred miles away, to another anonymous location. Maybe even handed off from someone else that has them delivered. This puts another buffer between you and your final product. Well, that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got for now. If I were you and just starting out, I&#039;d &quot;map&quot; it ALL out on paper. You&#039;re a college educated professional, use those skills you&#039;ve learned for good use. Make a business plan, detailing even the smallest of points. And then look at everything that might get in the way, and make a backup plan. Good luck.
