				joolz, here&#039;s some friendly advice: if you want people to take you seriously, then you need to take this place seriously as well.&nbsp; stop with the threats, the spammy threads, the rehashing of old things.&nbsp; at this point, you&#039;re just stirring up shit for the sake of being a troll and it makes people not want to take you seriously (and in turn, not want to help explain things because they have to do so a hundred times without you actually listening). <br /><br />if you have a problem, ask one of the admins privately.&nbsp; show some respect and you&#039;ll be given respect in return.

				If you feel so fiery about it, joolz, you should make a thread for vendors that abuse vendor powers/are asses/lazy/whatever.&nbsp; There is a thread for scamming vendors (who scam in bulk), but not a centralized one for shitty transaction vendors. Probably because nobody beleives newer buyers and put so much trust into vendors. The complaints seem to be scattered everywhere without naming vendors, also.&nbsp; It would be a nice counter to blacklisting threats.<br /><br />Maybe put some thought into it. I&#039;d certainly use any information that helps me tread more lightly. ;) <br />Anyway, sorry for your loss.&nbsp; Although, everyone who uses SR should be prepared to lose their money either way.&nbsp; It&#039;s a basic risk :)

				My first post...<br /><br />Joolz, a few years ago I got sued and lost a court case. EVERYONE I talked to including my lawyer said I should have won but I didn&#039;t and almost lost my house as well as almost having to declare bankruptcy. Shit happens. Now you can continue to complain about this for years and years and be all stressed and angry about it or you can move on. You lost $500 and that sucks, but you wouldn&#039;t have good days unless you had bad days.<br /><br />The questions to be answering are what did I learn and how can I behave differently to make this less likely next time.

You lost $500 and that sucks, but you wouldn&#039;t have good days unless you had bad days.<br /><br />The questions to be answering are what did I learn and how can I behave differently to make this less likely next time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^If I could, then +1.

				Whew. Think youre handling this wrong bro, but its your money. <br />I&#039;m actually interested in this. Never really thought of how resolutions are handled. I&#039;ve never had the need, or even come close. <br />So, I&#039;m reading, asking myself questions. First was obviously, what are both parties stats? Those were answered, but thats about it. <br />Next is this: Joolz, even though you have pretty good stats, theyre not perfect. What happened in the other cases? <br />Then, didnt you just say something about being here &quot;for years?&quot; I thought you were a noob? <br />Tessellated makes a good point, too. Joolz, take a deep breath then simply and to the point explain what happened. <br />Although, and dont blow off track here, this is just an observation, dealing with shitty vendors and having new accts every few months sounds like a scam. Honestly, Im not really sure if this is a bad thing when vendors who couldnt sell big macs at mcdonalds are the ones gettin it! People who can&#039;t properly function on the road are the ones who put us all in danger. A little push to get em movin might not be such a bad thing. (Wow, I cant believe i said that...gonna need some time to think on this one!)<br />...If these details were posted in one of the other threads, srry. Dont have time right now to sift through them all, and the search function never works right for me. It would be good to get everything compiled into one thread though.

				I&#039;ve had similar situations in the past, it&#039;s easy for people to forget that vendors aren&#039;t the only ones who are scam targets. However as has been said in here there is also plenty of hassle on the vendors&#039; end to worry about and they have to exercise caution. From what I&#039;m seeing it looks like you bought from someone who was just starting to turn scam or dropping a ball somewhere and who had enough positive feedback to keep it from being an afterthought decision. But when you make a thread like this you piss everyone off, because you&#039;re essentially saying the SR staff does shit at their jobs and instilling baseless fear in the community. You lost out and there are people here that get scammed but by ringing the bells and shouting from the hills about it you may have brought unwanted attention and may impact other peoples&#039; business who are legit. Don&#039;t feel too bad, I&#039;ve made a similar mistake before it&#039;s easy to make when you&#039;ve lost alot of money and have limited means of getting it back. It&#039;s better to calmly go about things and I&#039;m sure it&#039;d be hard to stay calm after losing the resolution but there are other ways to do it than this. Hell if you had garnered enough community support you may have had some sympathizers trying to be kind to you, perhaps this is too optimistic to think but hey you never know.

				joolz - i want to sympathize with you but you do not represent yourself well, in fact, your posts are counterproductive. Sorry for your loss dude, but push back and view your posts like you were a fly on the wall, how would they appear to you?<br /><br /><br />HawkeyeSteve said:<br /><br />&quot;Joolz, a few years ago I got sued and lost a court case. EVERYONE I talked to including my lawyer said I should have won but I didn&#039;t and almost lost my house as well as almost having to declare bankruptcy. Shit happens. Now you can continue to complain about this for years and years and be all stressed and angry about it or you can move on. You lost $500 and that sucks, but you wouldn&#039;t have good days unless you had bad days.<br /><br />The questions to be answering are what did I learn and how can I behave differently to make this less likely next time.&quot;<br /><br />I had the exact same experience, totally bogus trademark lawsuit, that cost me $330,000 and did force me into bankruptcy - and in the bankruptcy the guy that sued me LOST HIS TRADEMARK because we finally got to the facts of the matter.<br /><br />But back to point, another poster offered this next pc of advice in different language - i&#039;ll make it simple: an old timer, when i first went into business advised me to &quot;not make dumb&quot; mistakes. I responded that i&#039;d be dead in the water, as i made them all the time. He corrected me by saying that we all make stupid mistakes, but making the same stupid mistake again and again was dumb. <br /><br />It looks like the best you can do at this point is at least look at what you did wrong - it looks like you didn&#039;t vet the seller very well - had i seen his stats I would not have purchased. I&#039;m a newbie here, but i learned a long time ago, if i see smoke, i assume there&#039;s fire <br /><br />all you&#039;re doing now is keeping this boiling in your stomach - put it behind you and just don&#039;t make the same mistake again - take a stiff drink and forget it<br /><br />FWIW<br /><br /><br />hell, all i did was post a question and with only 10 posts already have a -1 karma - guess i asked the wrong question

				Joolz, i will give you the $500 you lost back, under one condition, you have to stop posting for 6 months.

				Order never arrived, doesn&#039;t come up with tracking number.. Makes false allegations, outright unpleasant, unprofessional and unreasonable! He recommends himself with the following message:&nbsp; &quot;Hey SR! I am CannabisArbiter. I grew up in Southern California, and am now finishing my Chemistry degree in Northern CA. I think I could bring some really great concentrates and flowers to the menu here.&quot; This webpage is all about trust and goodwill.. well this boy &quot; CannabisArbiter &quot; or CannabisArbiter(97) as he calls himself is to my opinion the total contrary of everything this webpage ( SR ) stands for.I FEEL CHEATED, MISTRUSTED AND OUTRIGHT OFFENDED BY THIS VENDOR, ACCUSING ME OF THE FOLLOWING: &quot;Especially considering your high refund rate, it appears to me that you purposly delayed this resolution so that it would be particularly difficlut for me to find your tracking number and prove that your order was indeed sent ... and I do recall asking for your address after you requested an extention and did not receive it until just 4 days ago.&quot; ALL THIS IS UNTRUE AND RIDICULOUS. And what really offended me the most was his &quot; gipsy &quot; kind of proposal to come to a resolution by offering to resend part of the order!! I DON&#039;T CARE ABOUT MONEY, I CARE ABOUT HONESTY AND MY REPUTATION. No matter how long this man has been selling here and how positive some of his clients seem to be: SOMEONE WITH THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SR AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED!

				Joolz your communication skills suck, you make very little sense with what you write, do you speak english properly, cause you certainly can not write properly, its nearly impossible to understand what you are trying to saying!<br /><br />That said, i looked at the vendor (we got some for you) who you have this problem with and if the resolution process is based on a comparison of stats and previous history etc., then i think you really should have got your money back! He seems like a bit of a joke!<br /><br />Peace!

				Silk Road is a relatively new concept.<br /><br />There are alternatives to Silk Road, such as Black Market Reloaded (BMR) and the newer Altlantis, which accepts litecoins in addition to bitcoins.<br /><br />However, all three of these are still very new, and invite-only trading forums (if you are familiar with Research Chemicals, then think of EK, RCBay, YBR, etc) except over Tor.<br /><br />Such forum-based market communities are pretty rudimentary, usually using the same software Silkroad Forums uses, Simple Machines, though others are sometimes used. A new forum platform, called Discourse, may be an interesting alternative to the older forum server software packages, but its security or practicality over Tor has not been rigorously battle-tested.<br /><br />These forum-based black markets have been around even before Tor existed, the best and more exclusive ones run over secret OpenVPN networks operated on an invite-only basis, same as the forums run within it.<br /><br />For us, however, such forums would be undesirable unless the invite-only VPNs were operated over Tor.<br /><br />There are alternatives to centralized forum software, such as Retroshare and private usenet servers (binary newsgroup servers) and more obscure and esoteric platforms, but most people are unfamiliar with these, and their security and reliability are relatively untested, so it may not necessarily be wise to rely on them for something serious like drug and contraband vending.

				at the beginning i got scammed a lot. i tried to order cheap lsd from nl and nothing ever showes up so i know the feeling of loosing a lot of money.<br />for 2 month i had orderd lsd from a trusted vendor so i know him a long time on the road and everything arrived fast and as expected.then my last order lsd (300euro)where never sent and the vendor had gone.last seen&nbsp; 2 month ago....<br />i did fe to make it easier for him to get new stuff but this time i wish i didnt fe.i lost the money and i had to live with it.i lost also nearly 600 euro from the nl lsd orders.so when you buy drugs there is always a risk of been scammed or robbed.<br />now im a waiting a new lsd order from nl for 230 euro and really hope i get these goods.otherwise next month i give it a new try.but the money is gone.<br />hope you have more luck the next time.<br />greets mushie

				I feel for you bro, this vendor is clearly a unorganized lying unprofessional piece of shit, they most definitely should of sided with you. You appear to buy alot of shit and are more of an asset than that shit lick vendor. It sucks bro, but the SR mods clearly aren&#039;t going to do anything about it. Its a lost cause at this point but I would be pissed too. Wondering what did you base this decision off of? I think it slightly funny that you got under they&#039;re skin tho near the beginning of the thread and they were too puss to go into real details. Charge it to the game buddy.

				Even if I feel with you (and your loss) - it´s amazing how much stupidity sb can &quot;evaporate&quot;!<br /><br />Explain in detail what happened or STOP WRITING SUCH BULLSHIT!!! (your mother tongue is english?)<br /><br />You´re a grown up person (I hope), act like one...

Thinking, maybe English is not your first language, and maybe you&#039;ve been misunderstood because you don&#039;t communicate effectively. But now, mr joolz or whistleblower, or whatever, I see this post with a butchered quote, insinuating a cause, with a righteous fight against some oppressive evil empire, and suddenly I realize....you&#039;re talking about SR, the one entity in my life that has allowed me to anonymously circumvent the real evil that truly defines injustice against so many millions of people in this country. And ultimately, the epiphany is, that you sir have wasted my time, and I shall now go back to the real issues in the world, and leave you to the self serving battle against some ill defined injustice that usurped your....$500? What happened to you may, or may not, have been the just decision, but it happened in a place where many decisions are made every day, and the chance of errors are inevitable. And the ONLY reason that your plight has reached so many, is due to your relentless pursuit of....justice? freedom for the masses? the plight of the underdog? NO! It is the pursuit of the self-centered desire to recover your $500, and nothing more. With that said, I&#039;m outta here, never to return to any thread bearing any connection to the moniker joolz...&nbsp; I have no apprehensions concerning the remaining pages of this thread, the contents of which I have no interest in.
