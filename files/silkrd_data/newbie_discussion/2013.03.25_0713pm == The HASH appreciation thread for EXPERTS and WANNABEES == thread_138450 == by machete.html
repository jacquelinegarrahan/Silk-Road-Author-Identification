				Im creating this as a more pleasant way to spam away my 50 postings and I hope it works&nbsp; :D<br /><br />We could post here what hash products we bought and how we liked them and maybe how they compare to others.<br /><br />Ill start:<br />I bought some Pakistani Hash from Spanish Fly and I think its very good and definately worth the price since I need only very little of it to get high<br /><br />Id like to know how it compares to Emeralds Pakistani or other types of hash, how is the new Charras from subtickle from the UK in contrast to the hash from Spain?

				I too am a bit of a noob with hash, I&#039;ve had some in my time but couldn&#039;t tell you the ins and outs of it.<br />One thing I&#039;ve noticed is it tends to be slightly cheaper than weed on SR, weight-for-weight.<br />I love the taste &amp; smell, but all the hash I&#039;ve ever had is much less strong - otherwise I&#039;d be a convert.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I got an 8th of squidgy brown/black hash from UK GROW TEK .<br />It arrived within a couple of days and solid stealth. Was on-weight, maybe ever-so-slightly over.<br />The hash warmed quickly between the fingers and softened up nicely.<br />It was a lovely smooth, spicy smoke and very relaxing high - though again you&#039;d have to really hit it to get more than moderately stoned.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear if anybody else has found good, strong, domestic hash on SR? I hear UK sellers are a bit pants ATM :<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298.msg1172044#msg1172044

				From my experience bubble hash made in the USA is much better than all the imports I have had.<br /><br />I think with hash, the fresher the better. When you import morrocan hash that was smuggled in someones arse you have no idea when it was actually harvested!<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I have had bad bubble, and only a few import hashes, but from my experience American made is the best bang for my bucks.

				Not speaking for all UK vendors but i generally find better hash price/quality from overseas. Countries closer to morocco and Pakistan often are the best bet. I order mostly from Spanish vendors as its only a stone throws away from morocco so better odds of getting a good deal. Also directly from an Indian vendor
