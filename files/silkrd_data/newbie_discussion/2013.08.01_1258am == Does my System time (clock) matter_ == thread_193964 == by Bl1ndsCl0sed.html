				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I *know* I saw somewhere that the system time needs to be correct to successfully order on the SR.<br /><br />What&#039;s werid is that, running Tails, my clock always syncs to 4 hours ahead of my actual time.&nbsp; I can go into the preferences and click down 4 hours until its the correct time, but I&#039;m confused as to why Tails is syncing to the wrong time, even when I specify the proper time zone.<br /><br />It has the right minute value, just four hours in the future.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; 8)

				Hmmm let me guess, you&#039;re in the USA, east coast, Im going to go with somewhere around the New England area... <br /><br />Tails syncs to GMT always, it can never really know where you are (pssst, thats the idea) and so will default to GMT. Because the whole idea of tails is to rout you through a IP that is not your own, if it were to set the time itself, it would set it as wherever &#039;the internet&#039; thought you were... which would be wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;Change it if you like... or just learn your 4 +/- sums&nbsp; ;D

				Nope, doesn&#039;t matter- it is kinda the whole point to not know- unless you need it to tell time! Then again, you can just look at your watch :)<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t affect anything if that is what you are asking.

				yeah the only reason time matters to determine when your order got in transit. On the technical level the marketplace and your computer time is a non issue...you tracking your package is different. 1 hour is the difference in 3 days and 4 in some situations.

				Thanks for the answers guys, makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Annex, what makes you think I&#039;m up in New England, versus down south?&nbsp; <br /><br />Just Curious ;D

				It&#039;s truly a matter of convenience. <br /><br />Me -I&#039;m a stickler for my computer displaying the correct time. I simply like it like that.

				What you wrote made sense to me, so I figured you&#039;d be up north. To be honest I&#039;m not really sure, just kind of had a feeling I guess... Was I correct? <br /><br /><br />(Disclaimer: not american, totally going off stereo-types, probably made myself out like a real douchebag now...)

				Some Hidden Services become unreachable if your system clock is incorrect.
