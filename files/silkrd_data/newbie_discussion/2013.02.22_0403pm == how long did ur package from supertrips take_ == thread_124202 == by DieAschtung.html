				I had a few packages sent from him to East USA and they took a little over 3 weeks.<br /><br />I know recently he has been very overwhelmed and his support has been unreliable.<br /><br />However, he is very good with refunds and reships should anything at all go wrong. Hold your faith in him.<br /><br />-Mel

				Stay on his ass about it and have faith.<br /><br />But for the future I recommend using someone who doesn&#039;t require a FE especially if you&#039;re low on funds so they aren&#039;t tied.<br /><br />-Mel

				supertrips is a good vendor in my opinion....you must remember he is a vendor and not the european postal service.......<br />of late i have read on his vendor page that he has now upgraded his shipping methods so his sucess rate should improve greatly....
