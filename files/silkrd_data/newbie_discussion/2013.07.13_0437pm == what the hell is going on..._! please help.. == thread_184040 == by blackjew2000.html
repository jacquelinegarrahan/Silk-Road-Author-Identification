				hey,<br />I&#039;ve had 3 successful transactions at SR before, they all got through just fine, and received all of them 1 week after shipping..<br /><br />and now I got 3 new packages from 3 different sellers on the way.. they are all &quot;In Transit&quot; and still didn&#039;t received none of them..<br />:-((<br />one has shipped 23 days ago, the other one has shipped 18 days ago, and the last one was shipped 11 days ago <br />I know that the last one was not shipped very long ago but the problem is that I already purchased from this vendor before and got his package after just 1 week<br /><br />could someone please tell me what the hell is the problem..?? is it just a coincidence or something is wrong.. because i really start to freak out here..<br />

				Hmm that is a really really odd thing to happen. Are you sure you used a real name and address? did you double check? right now i&#039;d go and make sure i was in contact with each of those vendors. hope it works out dude.

				It really depends on how much you ordered and whether or not the shipments are international. Get in touch with each of the vendors and explain the situation to them. It&#039;s possibly that your address may be flagged since three packages aren&#039;t showing up at the same time, but there&#039;s no way to be sure. Good luck

				I personally have had international packages arrive in about 8 days.....I have also waited 17 days from the same vendor before. But if its 3 packages I dont mean to scare you but it would scare me....

				How often would you guys say it&#039;s safe to have a package delivered to home address?<br /><br />And am I just better off getting a P.O. box under my name?

				If they are international that isn&#039;t particularly concerning. International packages can take several weeks to arrive.

				Ya, that&#039;s what I was thinking Ninja...&nbsp; switch sending to&nbsp; P.O. box and home randomly. I hear a lot of stuff about not using your shit at the address it&#039;s sent too... <br /><br />Is that really as big of an issue?

				Thats why &quot;drops&quot; are used. addresses used strictly for packages, not for dealing, or using. if you dont mind, what are you trying to get and how much of?

				Just a little H for personal. Would you consider the P.O box to be a drop site?

				Drops have absolutely no ties to you at all. nothing that can be proven to be linked to you, so thats where you have to be smarter than the next guy. So unless the Box was in someone else&#039;s name I&#039;d say no, but if its H for personal, under a quarter i assume, id just have it sent to the house or PO box. id also go ahead and buy something random off of amazon or some big dick pills. gives you an excuse of why you opened a po box and if you were to be questioned then you could play the &#039;wtf is that sand&#039; card
