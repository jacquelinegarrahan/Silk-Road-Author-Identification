				&nbsp;Hello every one, for those of you that know me, and for those that are new around here. I am DirtyBiscuitz, and aside from my personal transactions on SR, my purpose here is to help keep this thing of ours running as smoothly and as safely possible, to the best of my limited ability. <br /><br />Every day there are dozens of threads started here, asking questions that have not only been asked countless times before, but answered as well.<br /><br />The idea of this thread, is for new members to be able to find the info they seek, in here, before running up thread space. <br /><br />Any and all inquiries one might have can be sought after here, and is encouraged.<br /><br />&nbsp;If I myself am not, for some reason, able to give a confident solid answer to a question, I will do my best to direct you to some one who can be of more specific help.<br />I also am calling upon all the &#039;OG&#039; members of the forums to contribute when and where possible, in an effort to better inform the new comers, whilst cutting down on thread space.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;So, fire away newbsters..I&#039;ll be awake and attentive all AM long. How may I be of assistance?<br /><br />Much love every one 8)<br />&nbsp;

				from what I&#039;ve gathered there are 3 points we noobs have to remember:<br /><br />- always read a vendor&#039;s review thread before buying<br />- never FE<br />- always use PGP<br /><br />oh, and it&#039;s also a bonus if you&#039;re active and nice in the community :)<br />anything else we should keep in mind?

				A lot of noob questions can be answered ten times over by just using the search function. <br /><br />How do I buy bitcoins?<br />Is it safe to use my home address?<br />Who has the best *insert drug here* on SR? <br />How do I use PGP?<br /><br />These questions pop up all the time.<br />I do think that not everyone uses the SR wiki. It&#039;d be really useful to put everything in a thread here in the forum.

				I&#039;d just like to add one little gem for those starting out on the Road.. yeah i am still in Newb status,&nbsp; but have been active on the road for almost a year now and have some pretty reasonable stats. I just cant be arsed posting BS posts to get my status &quot;upgraded&quot;.. i am not that concerned about it..<br /><br />ANYWAY... I know how awesome it is to receive your first few successful orders and the subsequent urge to want to tell everyone about it, but when you post Vendor feedback after Finalizing, please DONT put your country of origin in it. EG : &quot; really great service, product excellent and only took xx days to (country) &quot; <br /><br />Its hard enough with LE scrutinizing our methods, without giving them an indication of which source countries may be &quot;hot&quot; . I have seen LE profile a source country which i used to purchase from with no issues, then crack down on that particular country&#039;s mail to the point where its no longer viable to order from there. I know you may think you are doing other buyers from your country a favor by quoting where you are in the feedback, but trust me its just tipping off the feds. In addition, dont mention anything about Vendor packaging, aside from the quality of it. I recently read in one of the threads someone painstakingly detailing a Vendors stealth method.... i dont think he is going to be too happy about that. <br /><br />As has been noted multiple times across all the threads for Newbs... READ up and study before you make that purchase. Understand and accept the risks that we take here. <br /><br />Enjoy and be safe.
