				So I am going to a closed GOA party. Info where the party takes place I will receive next week. At least so says the internet page where I found it.<br />I have been in email contact with one of the organisers of the party and he seems to be a nice person and answered every time my emails.<br /><br />But I am a new in the town I live now and have no party-friends at the moment<br />Anyway I thought I would visit the party taking before some acid and molly )))<br /><br />so have you guys ever visited those kind of closed GOA parties? how safe would it be for me alone with no friends to hang around there while being high on acid and molly? or is it better to stay away?

				Been to a few similar parties, mainly psytrance, I don&#039;t think you would have anything to worry about, most are really friendly, if you are worried though I would leave the Acid out till your comfortable there!<br />Have Fun.

				People at such GOA parties are usually very friendly, I wouldn&#039;t be worried. Though I probably wouldn&#039;t take both mdma and lsd the first time, not knowing anyone, in an unknown environment
