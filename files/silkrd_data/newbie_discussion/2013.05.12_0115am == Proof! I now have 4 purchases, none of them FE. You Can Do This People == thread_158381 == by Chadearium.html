				That makes 2 of us! I placed 5 orders a couple weeks ago as a newbie and no FE was required for any of them. I&#039;m waiting for the last one but just placed 3 more orders from different vendors, none of which require FE. I did not get ripped off and made some mushroom tea last night that was an incredible experience for my girlfriend and I. Start small and find reliable vendors and you&#039;ll be good!

				i think theres enough vendors on here that if you do your research and find the stable and reputable ones<br />you wont have to unless you want to help them out. (ive done it a few times w/o problems)<br />only once did i get caught with my pants down. from that POS lucydrop! if you notice that a reputable<br />vendor that previously&nbsp; never asked for FE is now asking everyone to do it, should throw up a red flag!<br />got me once. it was a lesson.

				Well, I suspect...not sure, but I suspect...that I have fallen victim to a phishing site or my account was in some other way compromised and that cost me .45BTC, (If that is indeed what happened. I&#039;ll find out for sure when I hear back from support)<br /><br />So you can bet your sweet ass that once I DO get funded, I will NEVER. EVER. FE.&nbsp; Not once. Not if I&#039;ve dealt with they guy and had good results, not ever. And if you&#039;re one of those vendors who requires it. I&#039;m not even looking at your shit.

				damn mrmiller.. its always a good idea to stay in escrow for sure. but i have one vendor that <br />i communicate with all the time and have no problem with it. have done it several times with no<br />problems at all. actually once they sent the wrong product. and they fixed it right away with NO<br />questions asked. just depends on how much faith you have in their word
