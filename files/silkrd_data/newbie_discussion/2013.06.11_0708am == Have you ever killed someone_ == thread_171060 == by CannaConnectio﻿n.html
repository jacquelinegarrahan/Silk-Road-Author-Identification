				There was a period in my life when I did it, a lot of times (also if not in the conventional way 99% of people do it; I did it in a way many people don&#039;t think possible but it&#039;s actually much worse than dying from a pistol or knife or similar things - after a while you pray to die) for whatever fancy motive it did came into my mind if someone crossed my path too much.

				No. LOL.<br /><br />You raise a particular dead (or more than one, depending on what you want to do) in a cemetery that&#039;s died from less than an year and you send it to the victim to destroy his/her life. Depending on the type of spirit you raised the more gruesome the life of the man/girl becomes, till death. The best sort of these spirits are those of serial killers or similar.

				Necrophilia has NOTHING to do with Necromancy. They are not the same word, do you know?<br /><br />Straight from Wikipedia (since I couldn&#039;t bore now to explain it in my own words totally):<br />&quot;Necromancy: /ˈnɛkrɵˌmænsi/ is a claimed form of magic involving communication with the deceased – either by summoning their spirit as an apparition or raising them bodily – for the purpose of divination, imparting the means to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge [ED: or do services for the caller]. The term may sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft.

Not because I care for secrecy - I don&#039;t care about it at all - it is just that you cannot really explain these things in a forum, it&#039;s impossible. Necromancy is one of the most dangerous things to try in the occult; without a solid background on certain topics it would, in the best cases, not work and in the worst... better if you don&#039;t know.<br /><br />If you are really interested in the argument there are some books around you can research before you can learn what it takes (as the Goetia or Heptameron) and then it will not difficult to discover specifically about Necromancy itself (btw you can do the same thing also with certain demons of the Goetia, it is only that Necromancy is even more powerful if more dangerous).<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Btw this is how the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; in the 80s started. A Palo Mayombe priest used to skin alive young Mexican teenagers to feed the spirit that was kept inside the typical cauldron (nganga or prenda, as they call it). He had a very vast clientele, ranging from drugs cartels, to very powerful businessman, to politics etc. all of whom paid the priest exorbitant amounts of money for his services since his spells had fame to work wonders. The priest, however, one day got the very bad idea to skin alive an American teenager and the world broke lose. You can read about this story in detail in &quot;Buried Secrets&quot; by Edward Humes.

				If the police wanted to find you, they could. even on TOR, and i&#039;m guessing most buyers only use TOR as there proxy, no VPN. no Virtual machines or Linux. (Would cost a lot of there resources probably, but for murder I&#039;m sure money wouldn&#039;t be an issue) <br /><br />So if you post a full confession of murder on here, and the FBI, are observing the thread, waiting for someone to confess. expect your door to be knocked down within the next month.

				not proud of it once before i started muay thai i went to far but where i grew up in aus there is allot of violence i witnessed one person beaten to death and another throat cut by the time i was 18 id fight every weekend out of town gangs and football teams would bring a guy down and my friends would put up money for me to fight them at the botanical gardens , i never did stomp a man while he was down and rarely used weapons unless the other person did first iv been beaten twice and only knocked out once when i was 16 i copped a knee capping and baseball bat to the face which broke most of my facial bones by the time i was 18 id been stabbed shot at had guns down my throat and witnessed a violent murder by beating infront of me i used to drink allot and was small only 70kg so i never fought anyone smaller or the same size as me the other time i was beaten it was middle of the day sunny day and 8 big aboriginals jumped out of 2 cars and started beating a 14 year old kid everyone else was standing around watching to scared to do anything so i went in to help got the kid out but only landed one punch before i was on my back from there i was kicked stomped and jumped on for 3.47 minutes it was recorded. i was never at any stage knocked unconsiouse the baseball bat dislocated my jaw so i dont get knocked out that way i decided against the surgery for that reason, after the beating i stood up laughing i had also been cut and stabbed a few times with a bottle and laughed lit up a smoke and wobbly said you still couldnt knock me out lol next thing i know im in a neck brace in a ambulance with a fractured neck and bootprint bruising on my face lol but 2 weeks later i was walking i went to the pub with a mate where they all hanged out and i filled my sock with a pool ball and continued beating them one didnt make it.<br />i also witnessed a mate who had drug psychosis stab a man 60+ times in the face and body and didnt know why he did it afterwards google it his name was callum smith hes out now he got 6 years but we have both moved towns.<br />to different places<br />i did grow up and lived almost my whole life in the statisticly most violent town in australia and it only had 40,000 people in it.<br />now days i stopped drinking 4 years ago i fight muay thai inside the ring only there is no animosity and i am a trained security gaurd and bodygaurd and am looking to get into youth work to make sure kids dont go down the path i did in small towns. as a result of numerouse violent encounters i now suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome which isnt fun.
