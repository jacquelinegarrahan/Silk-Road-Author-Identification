				Most of the people on this site strike me as a civilised and educated bunch, not what the daily mail would have you believe about the silk road.<br /><br />I work as a technician in the research of concrete and reinforcement of nuclear storage bunkers and have many years experience in my field. this is probably not the type of job that non drug users would think of a druggy holding down and actually excelling at. I earn way above the average UK wage and am working on a daily basis with people who are as straight as can be and they would never suspect me of being a habitual user.<br /><br />what do you do for a crust?

				I do film and art. Just graduated undergrad and I&#039;m looking for a job in video production right now. It&#039;s interesting I think to learn what kind of people are here on SR. Not to delve too deep and endanger anyone of course.&nbsp; I think one thing SR demonstrates is that druggies aren&#039;t all sketchy dudes who constantly avoid real work. A lot of times, I think they&#039;re actually really entrepreneurial types, real driven types. I&#039;ve read a couple of great stories on erowid about some of the science and chemist types that have gotten involved with psychonaut ventures, and it&#039;s pretty entertaining stuff.

I mean what are the famous films with drugs. They&#039;re either something like Scarface, hyper violient gangsters, or they&#039;re slacker hippie stuff like Dazed and Confused. There&#039;s also &quot;weird ass trippy shit&quot; like Enter the Void, which I love, hahaha. <br /><br />It&#039;s also a dangerous combination of money and lack of social acceptability I think. Because drugs make a lot of money. Because they&#039;re illegal they have huge margins. Makes it hard to get close to it, and not get sucked in. I know when I first started using SR, I would buy bulk because it was cheaper and then sell off the rest to friends. But that quickly puts a strain on relationships. Between the allure of money and fear of getting caught, there&#039;s not a lot of room for a healthy relationship with drugs sometimes. Now that I&#039;m older I&#039;ve found a balance there, but I can see why for a lot of people, the anti-social stereotypes become true. I&#039;ve heard it from an alcoholic that the hardest thing about quitting was that once he quit, he lost all his friends, because all his friends were drinking buddies. I think it&#039;s a similar thing with drugs (well alcohol is a drug but I mean illegal drugs). Because it&#039;s illegal, it&#039;s hard to be casual about it around people who don&#039;t do it, so it becomes a defining aspect of people&#039;s lives instead of just another hobby or preferred aspect of lifestyle. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just to be fair...<br /><br />There is a huge correlation between using drugs and being a loser.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There&#039;s also a correlation between drugs and IQ level.

Then my SR work, which I started just to see if I could started to take more and more of my time up, I set up a UK ltd company as a front and took to the read 24/7, now I work a hell of a lot more hours but the work is more fulfilling. and I earn a fuckload more + I get to chill with you crazy peeps all day every day. wohooooooooo&nbsp; :o<br />ACE

You&#039;re honest about buying weed solely and only? Good for you. You don&#039;t use your real name and address, do you? &#039;Cos if you do, with your above description, you just gave away a mean to narrow it down to a max of 50 peeps. Did you ever buy other drugs than weed on SR and got them delivered at home? Do you buy your drugs (weed, it is) domestically only? You don&#039;t import them from other countries, by any chance do you? If you did, you might want to make sure you won&#039;t from now on, you wouldn&#039;t get the same sentence at all. And nobody needs to suspect you of using now. You gave it all away, LE knows it. Who amongst 50 other persons max, is a &quot;habitual user&quot; + buyer/importer of personal amounts pot, that&#039;s their question right now. I hope your colleagues smoke pot too, use Tor and SR, just like you. Else you might stand out a little. 50 mailboxes to put under surveillance is all it takes. And being paranoid helps, correct, just as much as being self sufficient and blatantly reckless hinders.<br />I&#039;ll get back to you below, as there might be more to it.<br /><br />@hopesalive: you shouldn&#039;t give that kind of info away. How much other &quot;teachers being also professor, tutor and salespersons of female sex having one or several children&quot; are there out there? I&#039;ll guess: one or two others, maybe? <br />Than on top that holding&nbsp; &quot;a B.S. and an M.A. and being a pain patient (as in medical pot treated patient?) and being 45-55 years old or more?&quot; Lemme guess? US? I&#039;d say no other on SR. And in the US? Well that widens the spectrum, but still, not that many. You don&#039;t import neither, I assume? You&#039;re smart (well sort of), so you catch the drift here and read the paragraph above .<br /><br />I&#039;m focusing on the first and last post here for the sake of argument, and because these are the most detailed replies on this thread, also. The ones in between aren&#039;t really any smarter, to divulge, in my opinion. Why on earth would you guys want to give away that much info/intel? You like the heat? You don&#039;t care getting identified? What are you on the Road for? Making friends and bragging how well you did, or buying/selling drugs anonymously? You think you&#039;d get away with it? It is still illegal to buy and use drugs, if I recall correctly. Even more to import them. Or to resell or share them. Surely you have the moneys to hire yourself a lawyer. And as you guys are &quot;civilized and educated&quot;, you won&#039;t be investigated, or get your parcels snagged ever, you&#039;re immune to that. Getting busted is for &quot;the minorities&quot;, isn&#039;t it? What are you gonna do if you, if the prosecutor goes all out? Waive your diplomas? And surely nothing on your computers would be able to link you to this accounts? Everything&#039;s encrypted, safe and sound, ready to be deleted in a whim. <br /><br />Yes? Congrats! No? That&#039;s where I&#039;d start to worry...<br /><br />A few things we can learn:<br />- you can be educated and still clueless<br />- if you want to take advantage of anonymity, your required to STFU.&nbsp; <br />that is not bragging about how well you&#039;re off in life or disclosing where you poop, NOR what you do for a living.<br /><br />&nbsp;Please hit the modify button and cut all that info/intel out if you think I&#039;m right.<br /><br />Another thing: if I was LE, I&#039;d start a thread exactly like this, asking people to willingly disclose personal information. I&#039;ll start with &quot;Most of the people on this site strike me as a civilised and educated bunch, not what the daily mail would have you believe about the silk road&quot; so to encourage them to point out their education and singularities, be proud of it and disclose it so to make a point of your difference to the lowlife mainstream criminal depicted in the news. <br /><br />Honestly I&#039;d favor you&#039;re LE over self sufficient and arrogant.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would know. <br />I am agent working for the US govt., more specifically I&#039;m involved in Blackbriar.<br /><br />Peace out.<br />Jason
