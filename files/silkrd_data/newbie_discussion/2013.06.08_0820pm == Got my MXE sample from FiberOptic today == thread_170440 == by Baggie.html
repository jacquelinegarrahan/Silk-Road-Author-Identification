				5/5 on shipping took like 4 days First Class.<br /><br />10/5 Stealth! OMG It was genius as fuck, Not going into details on it but rest assured that he has your back!<br /><br />10/5 on quality of his product! I received the order and immediately ingested 50mgs... I am very experienced with MXE and used to purchse from CosmicWholesale.com before the closed up shop and thought that their shit was amazing... I was wrong... This shit is clean as fuck, I have a clear head and feel quite out of body right now. Energy, Dissociation, Euphoria.. I AM GOD! PLEASE ORDER SOME OF THIS SHIT PEOPLE!!!! BEST I&quot;VE EVER HAD PERIOOOOODDDD!!!!!!!<br /><br />You guys MUST get some of this shit!!! If you are looking for MXE then please go no further! FiberOptic is your man and boy is his shit potent!<br />Goddamn dude hahahaha yea FO you have a new customer here ;D<br /><br />I also received a sample of 5F-Ur-144 From FiberOptic that I&#039;ve yet to test. I will post back with a report on that as soon as I find out how safe it is to ingest with MXE.

				MMMMmmmmm, I love the MXE.&nbsp; I wish I had found the road a couple backs before I ordered a fresh batch.&nbsp; Are they still doing samples?<br /><br />There is nothing like a little MXE and a touch of cannabis to melt away depression and stress on a Saturday afternoon

				I&#039;m not 100% certain if he is still doing the samples on 5f-Ur-144 but to my knowledge he is all out of samples for MXE. It is very clean and potent stuff man hahahaha I am feeling right as fuck right now! I know that I will order from FiberOptic when I need MXE for as long as he is on the road ;D
