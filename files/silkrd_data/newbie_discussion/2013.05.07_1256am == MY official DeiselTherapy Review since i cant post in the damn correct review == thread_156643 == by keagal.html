				I know this thread is in the incorrect place but I made a promise to a vendor....<br />&nbsp;I ordered from dieseltherapy right before the site had its DOS attack. I am gonna start with this... DT was so cool about everything!<br />I was not able to get online to finalize the order until i believe the 5th and the order arrived on the 27th of April.<br />I asked if he could have it here before my birthday and he made my birthday when i received my order on my bday! My order was a stamp of coke and H btw.<br />thank you so very much for making my birthday manageable :)<br />now for product review...<br />&nbsp;PRODUCT---&nbsp; the gear was great. i have been ordering from DeluxeDelivery since my time in SR. but i had some extra change so i figured i would check DT out.<br />I am a moderate user and the stamp of H gave me 3 solid hits. I don&#039;t like the nodding feeling. i just IV enough to add a smile to my day and he definitely made that happen.<br />The coke was AWESOME. The coke around here sucks but i loaded half the stamp on the spoon with my second IV of H and i took off! <br />SHIPPING--- Shipping was stealth. came in little zip bags. Not much to say about this because i got it.<br />CUSTOMER SERVICE--- he was great. the bags arrived on my birthday just as i requested! plus he responded to all the questions i had as well as being understanding to the SR site being down and having to wait for my release of funds.<br /><br />All in all I will order again and will FE without hesitation<br />thank you for being a great vendor in the SR community! <br />see you soon-<br />keagal

				And missramona182 is a shill. I received DT&#039;s package today after waiting more than anybody should for a domestic order and it was garbage. Not sure if it had any actual dope in it all. Stay away people, something&#039;s off about this guy.

				Update: I posted too soon and for that I apologize, I received 2 small bags, the first one was all cut. It burned and gave me a terrible migraine. I was about to throw the other one in the garbage but reluctantly decided to try it first. Glad I did, it turned out to be pretty decent. I wish he would of just sent the good one though, thats all I paid for anyhow.
