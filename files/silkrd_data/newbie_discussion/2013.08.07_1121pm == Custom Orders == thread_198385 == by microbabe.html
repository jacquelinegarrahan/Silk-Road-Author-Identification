				Title: <strong>Custom Orders</strong><br />

				Hey so a potential buyer PM&#039;ed me saying he was a few bucks short to purchase one of my products ($10 to be exact), so I agreed to work with him.&nbsp; The gift code feature is unavailable, so I made him a custom order.&nbsp; He says he doesn&#039;t want to do a custom order because &#039;he has never had to before&#039; and if i could just send the .10 btc to his account so he could buy from my normal listing.&nbsp; Is there something bad about custom orders that I&#039;m not getting? Or does it sound fishy?<br /><br /><br />Stay safe out there<br />-Microbabe

				that sounds way to fishy, like you will be heading to a dispute down the road or he will try to cancel, there is nothing wrong at all with custom listings they are there for a reason and are the same as a normal listing i would be careful doing anything outside of the escrow system of SR i wouldnt send anything but thats your call

				Hey thanks! I like to think I&#039;m pretty nice, long as someone doesn&#039;t try to scam me lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;I sell MDMA. Capsules or raw powder/crystals.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to toot my own horn here, but these are very quality MDMA.&nbsp; I only sell what I actually use, and this MDMA has been so clean, I had to get an account on SR and share these with the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have access to other drugs, but at the moment I&#039;ve tapped into this pool of MDMA and plan on sucking it til it&#039;s dry first :)<br /><br />Visit my vendor page in my sig! PM if you have any question!<br /><br /><br />-Microbabe

				He&#039;s just trying to scam you for a few bucks.&nbsp; That&#039;s the only reason he won&#039;t take the custom listing.&nbsp; There are a few of these tools around, and I have been messaged by them more then once.&nbsp; Never send them anything, it&#039;ll just cause you grief.

				I just did a custom order, and it was ok. But a bit rushed, i didnt get what i was trying to get. But it is just a communication issue, other than that, I dont see any problems.
