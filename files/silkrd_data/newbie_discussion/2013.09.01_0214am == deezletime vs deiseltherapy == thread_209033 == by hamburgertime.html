				wondering if anyones tried both venders to compare quality, quantity, freebees, speed, and stealth. <br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered with deezletime and his product was GREAT for the price, real good shit. me and my friend did 3 stamps at once and we were throwing up all over the place.. good times. His stealth was unreal.. unfuckingreal. i ordered 50 bags from him and he gave me 4 free stamps. i ordered priority and he upgraded it to express for free and it showed up the next day after i ordered it. how does this compare to deiseltherapy?

				Deezletime is very generous with giving out freebies.&nbsp; People bitch about his bags being light, and it is very true...they are light.&nbsp; However, in my opinion, the quality makes up for the lightness of the bags.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered from him many of times, and he helped me out one time when I was super sick and I ordered 2 bags from him and he gave me 12.&nbsp; He upgraded me from Priority to Express for free,etc.&nbsp; He has been as close to a &quot;friend&quot; as you can get on Silk Road. <br /><br />I have ordered from DieselTherapy ONCE.&nbsp; The only time I did, I had a great experience with him as well. Fast shipping, quick communication, etc. I ordered 2 mints, and he sends 8.&nbsp; So, they both seem to be very generous people.&nbsp; DieselTherapy has fatter bags, w/less quality though.&nbsp; Yet again, all opinion based on quality...my tolerance is sky high thanks to Methadone Treatment...so I have to use 9-10 bags on DeezleTime to get off... so I wouldn&#039;t know quality if it hit me in the face.
