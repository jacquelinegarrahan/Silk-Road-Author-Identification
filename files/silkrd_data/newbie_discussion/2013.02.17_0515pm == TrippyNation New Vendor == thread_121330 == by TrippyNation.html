				hello,<br />although as brand new forum account my credibility is low but forgot password to original account, member for one year 198 transactions, anyway, fairly irrelevant.<br /><br />I purchased a sample that contained somewhere in the region of .2 grams of ketamine. I didnt weigh out but thought, hey why look a gift-horse in the mouth. It looked a lil short but it was free so watev.<br /><br />I put on some Move D vinyl at my mate&#039;s apartment after a day at work, and, having brought the letter which it arrived in with me, I decanted the contents of the baggie onto a mirror, crushed and went at it. These crystals resemble the pure racemic ketamine I was getting in Canada a few years ago. Small, granule and even crystals that crush down to dust with extraordinary ease. Sometimes K that&#039;s smuggled from India will have a jagged, uneven appearance when uncooked and MUCH tougher to break down. Well anyway, It went up very smooth, so no need to cook it like you would with Indian K. <br /><br />Taste: Sour, bitter, then numb, minty pharmaceutical tingling. Tastes like ketamine, basically.<br /><br /><br />I spaced out with my eyes closed on a leather sofa with a beautiful sound system purring to me. White, neutral, pulsing light&nbsp; A familiar experience. <br /><br />Packaging was quite average, but completely adequate, and vendor assured that improvement with vac-sealing/printed labels would be in action within a couple days. <br /><br />Good service, great k, would be good to see some bulk deals too, perhaps,<br /><br /><br />will order some when my coins come thru,<br /><br />they&#039;re a bugger to get. <br /><br />Thanks A++

				Hello, first of all sorry if my english is bad.<br /><br />Well, i ordered today from TrippyNation some Ket and 2c-i. The order will arrive in + - 10 days so i&#039;ll do a full review of the Ketamine when it arrives!<br /><br />All i can say now is that TrippyNation was very friendly and he helped with my first order to him.<br /><br />Cheers and i&#039;ll be here again in some days.

				I purchased 50x Mortal Kombats from TrippyNation a couple of weeks ago and was very pleased with the transaction. <br /><br />Communication 5/5: TN contacted me shortly after I placed an order reminding me to finalize early if I wanted to carry through with the order (I was already aware of this, it was stated on their vendor page).<br /><br />Shipping 5/5: Arrived to USA in 7 days total--amazing, considering where I live. I was very impressed.<br /><br />Stealth 2.5/5...not so good. Sealing was done poorly and there was a hole where, if you had opened the package, you could easily see the pills inside. It seems that the packaging was done in a rush.<br /><br />Product 5/5: Ran Marquis, Mandelin and Simon tests, everything tested as expected. Good, hardpressed Dutch pills.<br /><br />For my first FE, I was very happy with how quickly the package came. TrippyNation handled everything very professionally. The lack of stealth was the only issue; other than that, everything went perfectly.
