				Let me say that I had a whole lot of successful transactions with him at first.&nbsp; He did take between a week and a month to mail&nbsp; things out but he would just ask me to FE and I did.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t happy about the slow delivery, but I was getting my stuff and I could live with.&nbsp; Now check this out:<br /><br />Liston stated that he would and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...
