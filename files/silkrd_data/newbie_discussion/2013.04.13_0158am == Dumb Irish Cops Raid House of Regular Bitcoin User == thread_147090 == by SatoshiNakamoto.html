				Just posted on Bitcointalk:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.msg1820363#msg1820363<br /><br />So, as a few of you guys know, I&#039;m moving to another country soon enough. When I get over there I won&#039;t have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.<br /><br />So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.<br /><br />On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn&#039;t have all my paperwork on my car in order,&nbsp; so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.<br /><br />So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.<br /><br />Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should&#039;ve been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn&#039;t come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.<br /><br />They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn&#039;t) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn&#039;t selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn&#039;t valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn&#039;t prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).<br /><br />They then told me that if I didn&#039;t give them all the messages &amp; phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them &quot;analyzed&quot;. I was about to move country in the next few days and didn&#039;t want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I&#039;m obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.<br /><br />So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we&#039;re not breaking the law it doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get unwanted attention from the police.
