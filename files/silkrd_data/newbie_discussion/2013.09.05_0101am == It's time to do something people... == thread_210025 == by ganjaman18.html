				Hi everyone.<br /><br />Over the last few days the TOR network has seen a 5x increase in traffic. Without us doing something about it TOR will get slower and slower.<br /><br />Now is the time to set up your own Relay&#039;s and Exit Nodes people!<br /><br />I have set up 1 relay and 1 Exit Node running on a VPS in the last few hours. Funds permitting I will add more to the network.<br /><br />If you are running TOR on your PC then go to Vidalia and click &#039;Set up Relaying&#039;, choose your options (a relay will help SR, BMR &amp; ATL just fine) I have posted some information below for the more advanced users to set up a Linux VPS running Vidalia headless.<br /><br />We need to employ the Marc Emery strategy here and grow it faster than they can tear it down and there is only one way to do that.<br /><br />If you do not feel comfortable running a VPS of your own or even using your home PC as a connection, please consider donating some BTC to the address below. 0.025BTC is enough to set up a relay with 250GB/month of bandwidth with my host. That is 770KB/s you will add to TOR. You do not have to donate more than once, but the network could really use some spare bandwidth right now and I am more than willing to help out getting some relays online.<br /><br />My Donation Address - 16iu54S7x6RXhuRn51ywr8ergoicTHa3b9 (each 0.025BTC means 770KB/s extra on TOR for a month)<br /><br />Link to Relay Set-up guide (Home PC) - https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en<br /><br />Link to Relay Set-up guide (VPS/Linux Server) - http://www.darkcoding.net/society/running-a-tor-relay-node-server-on-ubuntu/<br /><br />I will be answering any questions below as and when I can and if you donate you can name the Relay! Let&#039;s save TOR together!

				OK... Since last night my Exit Node has been suspended with my VPS provider. Good thing I didn&#039;t put it on my web server. I am going to go on the hunt for another one ASAP and should have the nodes online before dinner. The good news is that .onions are running faster today so people must have got the message =P<br /><br />Will update this thread when we are online =]

				Okay... we are up to 3 Tor Nodes, I would like to thank our 2 Donators as well. Another one will be coming online over the next couple of hours too. And one more when the refund is processed by my VPS provider for the one they cancelled. For anyone interested in setting up Nodes of there own, Digital Ocean (digitalocean.com *CLEARNET WARNING*) offer well priced VPS&#039;s for PayPal. They also provide 1TB/month of Bandwidth so each node is contributing around 3MB/s to the network.<br /><br />I will copy down the config file for anyone that would like it and if you want I can give you the simple commands to set up your own. Thanks again for the donations, keep setting up those relays!

				Thanks to the Bitcoin from PefectStamps, when I get paid on Monday Tor will say hello to a brand new 4 Core, 8GB RAM, 5TB transfer/month relay. The traffic is now starting to seep onto the new relays. We can beat this BotNet.<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone who has donated today, I understand that certain people may not wish to expose themselves by running a Relay/Exit Node (e.g. Vendors, SR Staff, cautious buyers etc.) but if people who rely on Tor so much could at least find someone to run a relay for them we could make the network more resilient and faster than ever.<br /><br />Donations are still accepted and if we reach a large enough amount we can keep the massive relay mentioned above going for at least a few months, maybe even longer. =]<br /><br />Massive thanks to the SR community for the donations so far, TOR wouldn&#039;t exist without people like you guys. And also congratulations to everyone else who set up a relay of there own today. xD

				I have a secure rig that I only use for SR. I don&#039;t run Tor or anything related to the dark net on my main machine. My question is can I set up my phone with Tor as a relay. Is it safe for the network?
