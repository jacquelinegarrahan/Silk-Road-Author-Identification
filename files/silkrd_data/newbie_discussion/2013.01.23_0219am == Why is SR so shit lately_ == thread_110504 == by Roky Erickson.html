				You can start by being less disrespectful, you posting offensives language for no reason is at heart what&#039;s wrong with the community.<br />You personally arent the reason but like minded people with nothing of worth to contribute are the problem.<br />If you cant contribute positively don&#039;t post, not every thought has to be documented on the forum.<br />Your opinion of the moderators in no way is a honest perspective but a skewed one because you think in some way you are better than any other member.<br />Honestly you need to be less brutal in general, noboby wants to read the crap posts you&#039;ve been posting.<br />X)<br />nomad<br />

				In my opinion if everyone has such a horrible time on this site then they can use the power of technology to create a competitor to silk road and see how that works out?<br /><br />In the mean time those of us who respect this place for what it is are going to try to grow the community and support what decisions can be made to improve it.<br /><br />Probably don&#039;t realize it because you are so used to it, but there was a time when you couldn&#039;t just log on the internet and get whatever chemical you wanted to put up your nose (or in&nbsp; your body) at any point of any given day.<br /><br />Living in the future right now.

I had another account on here for over a year and it only had about 20 posts on it, so I&#039;m excluded from the forums UNLESS I post nonsensical shit, which I will gladly continue to do until you cunts stop taking my post count under 50.
