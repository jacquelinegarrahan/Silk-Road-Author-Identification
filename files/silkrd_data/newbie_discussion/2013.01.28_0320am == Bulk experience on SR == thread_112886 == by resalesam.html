				I&#039;m looking for lbs delivered but I&#039;m a little nervous about the weight. How have your experiences been? Do sellers send straight out in one package? I go through about 1lb every two-three weeks but tired of the limited strains I have around here to choose from. Anyone get lb prices if you work with a seller and have a consistent stream of smaller QP orders going through? I&#039;m not new to the game but definitely new to SR and the mail thing with such large amounts.

				I have no experience ordering things that can be picked up by dogs, but all of the best vendors on silk road specialize not only in obtaining some of the highest quality products in the world, but also in stealth shipping and making sure no detectable odors escape the package. Ordering cannabis domestically is the best idea, especially if you live in the USA since the quality is amazing and prices are equally so. As long as the package doesn&#039;t smell and it isn&#039;t obvious that there&#039;s something illegal inside just by looking at it, ordering domestically is almost a sure thing.<br /><br />There&#039;s a few things you should know about ordering weight for your own safety though. First of all, wherever you have it sent to, make sure there&#039;s nothing else illegal in that house, especially other drugs or paraphernalia . That way if the cops do show up before you open it it&#039;s easier for a judge to believe it when you say you had no idea what was in the package. And obviously, when it does arrive wait a few hours before opening, maybe even 24 hours.<br /><br />Also, make sure you know if it has to be signed for or not. Usually it won&#039;t have to be, and if the mail man asks you to sign for it when the vendor says you won&#039;t have to then you know something is up. Rule of thumb here is to say you weren&#039;t expecting anything and don&#039;t sign for it. Losing a couple grand is probably going to end up being less expensive than paying a lawyer to get you out of trouble, not to mention a tarnished record.<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of threads with more information on ordering bulk, but there&#039;s one thing you should always remember; NEVER TALK TO THE COPS!!! The dumbest thing you can do if you do end up getting arrested is to incriminate yourself. And for everyone else on Silk Road, don&#039;t tell them about where you got it&nbsp; ;D. We don&#039;t need any more attention than we already have.

				Yeah you really dont have much to worry about.<br />Most of the venders triple vacuum seal it and label it rather well. <br />Do business with good venders and you are safe.

				Thanks for the advice. I guess one package would be safer limiting your chances to get detected but I would like the drop to go into the mailbox versus being left at the door. It&#039;s a larger than average box there but not big enough for large packages. Yeah the people there won&#039;t sign for anything at this drop location and it will be a clean spot. Been there before, I know about cops and not talking. It&#039;s amazing how many people talk themselves into a hole as the cops act like they are doing some favor at the time. Nothing you say will help you in any regard and they are only trying to strengthen the evidence against you.

				What if you told the post man, &quot; I wasn&#039;t expecting anything but I&#039;ll take it anyway.&quot; Thats what I&#039;d say if i had to sign for a package I really wasn&#039;t expecting anyway. &gt;.&lt; I know, bad Idea...but i never get mail :[

				Thanks for my first good karma, modziw! The quote in your signature is actually the most important part of what I took from the thread that came from, coming straight from a former prosecutor if I&#039;m correct. Great advice, even if he&#039;s not who he says he is.<br /><br />resalesam, it seems like you know enough to keep yourself out of trouble. The only reason I posted that much obvious (in my opinion) info is because there&#039;s so many people who don&#039;t know the basics about what to do if the police show up. You would be surprised at how many people are smart enough to figure out tor and PGP but still have no idea how to deal with the law.<br /><br />But yea if you order domestic and buy from a reputable vendor, I&#039;d say your chances of something bad happening are approximately 1 in 1,000,000. Which in a domestic situation usually is just a lost or stolen package&nbsp; :P it sucks but it does happen once in a while. Other than that follow what you already seem to know and you&#039;re all good brother!&nbsp; 8)

				Yea man no problem. Obviously that 1 in 1,000,000 thing isn&#039;t based on research gathered and evidence. More realistically I should say slim to none, but either way chances are extremely low. As long as the vendor never screws up on packaging you will probably be able to order your pound every couple weeks for years and have nothing worse happen than a lost package or two. I used to know of a guy who ordered kilos of shit like methylone/mephedrone/2c&#039;s from China for YEARS and never got busted (didn&#039;t really know him, just knew some of the people he supplied). For the most part everything he got was legal (technically) at the time he bought them, but let&#039;s just say he was the kind of guy the feds wanted to catch so they could make those kind of things illegal. If people like this can exist you should have no problem staying safe.&nbsp; ;)
