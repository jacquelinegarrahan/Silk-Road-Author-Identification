				If you don&#039;t fulfill the fifty post requirement you will now be unable to post responses to vendor threads.As a result, this will negatively impact vendor reviews on the forum. To make matters worse, what about vendors who lack the fifty post minimum? Do they get a reprieve? I sure hope so otherwise, vendors won&#039;t even be able to interact with their clientele until they fulfill the fifty post minimum.

				Even if vendors get a reprieve it will still dramatically reduce the overall quality of the vendor review threads. A lot of vendors request that you follow up with a review in their thread and yet now that isn&#039;t any option for many people who don&#039;t wish to waste time making fifty worthless posts.

				Yeah, it&#039;s true they won&#039;t be able to leave follow ups, but then you could actually take more merit from people who bothered to get 50 posts to actually post a review. Unless they spammed their way, I guess.... but anyways...

				Its good because there will be a little bit more truth getting posted on here about vendor reviews though if people have to go through making 50 post makes them think more about what they should say! There are plenty people im guessing that already have 50 posts, just new users, or people creating new accounts are they ones that are going to have to go through it. Its only 50 post truely is not bad!

At least 50% of the reviews lack the fifty post requirement. Do vendors really want at least a 50% reduction in vendor review posts?

				Can the vendors maybe premote their product while they try to achieve these 50 posts? so once they do then their numbers will skyrocket in a couple days!... just a thought time will tell and everything has a way of working its self out, I know money and everything else is important and stuff, but there is so much more to it than that! Once I get my stuff up and running smoothly I would love to post great reviews on the vendors and be able to work with them and the people that are going through the same things I have to. or Have already done!

You will reach 50 in the blink of an eye, I really don&#039;t think it will be as much of a problem as it first appears. If you can&#039;t review you can&#039;t review, no one&#039;s gonna fie over it. <br /><br />And galacticnomad, I think it may have a little kinks to iron out for the first month, but overall I think it&#039;s a great improvement..... I think you generally reach 50 posts in about 2 weeks.

				Hey, midwestmedical, I&#039;m planning on becoming a vendor too, but since I can&#039;t post on the normal discussion forums, maybe you can help..<br /><br />What happens with your bond money if it turns out your business is not going good and you can&#039;t collect the 1500$/30 transactions? Can you denounce your vendor status and get the bond back? (assuming you really tried a legit business and not just wanted to scam people).

				You can always make a new thread here because obviously there are experienced users trying to make new accounts on the forums. Maybe help out some of the newer people, maybe they will end up purchasing something from you if you do fall under the vendor cataglory. It is only 50 posts, max it would take is 3 days.
