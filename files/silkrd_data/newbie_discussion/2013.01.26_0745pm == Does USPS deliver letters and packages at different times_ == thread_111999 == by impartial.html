				Do two different people from USPS deliver letters and packages?&nbsp; For example, one mailman drops off letters in the morning and a different mailman drops off packages in the afternoon.&nbsp; Is this rare/common?

				There are cases of this. I&#039;m not sure what the exact circumstances are though. I know during the holiday season my priority and express packages came from a post man who was different from my regular guy.

				I was expecting a package or 2 today, and the typical letters and spam came, but no packages.&nbsp; There is time left in the day still, was just curious.

				When I lived in apartments, we often had packages come in in the morning/ early afternoon from USPS followed by regular mail delivered by USPS in the late afternoon. Where I work, Priority and Express overnight packages are generally delivered by 10AM and we get general mail by 3PM.

				I wonder if this has something to do with how big your city is or something because where I&#039;m at, everything&#039;s done at the same time, which sucks because I typically don&#039;t get letter mail until afternoon.
