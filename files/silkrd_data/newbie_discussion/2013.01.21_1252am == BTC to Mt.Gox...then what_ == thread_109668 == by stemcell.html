				ok i cant figure this out. How do you get your money back after a transcation? i understand you can transfer it back to your Glox account but then how do you cash out? its not like you can walk into a bank and ask for $10k cash, that would be suspicious. Is there any options?

				Yes don&#039;t do it all in one transaction.<br /><br />Be aware there is nothing inherently suspicious with bitcoins or money transactions. That said, if you are serious about this and talking of 10k+ amounts, you should talk to someone who knows what they are doing. (i.e. limitless)<br /><br />I have my own idea for how to do it, but I&#039;m not a vendor so don&#039;t have any actual reason to use it.

				You lot smoke too much weed. Are the narcs really on to you?<br />Or perhaps you don&#039;t live the land of the free anymore.<br />You know, that feeling of guilty until proven innocent ?<br />I&#039;d look the teller straight in the eye and justly withdraw every penny of Â£10,000 from sales of any kind, and expect a complimentary briefcase to carry it in. Then I&#039;d demand a security guard to escort me to my car!<br /><br />Sorry it&#039;s the Valium, I think it killed my anxiety, what a relief.

				TI-83 Drug Wars. Remember that? Sometimes Officer Hardass got you, sometimes he didn&#039;t....<br /><br />Anyway, and first off, Happy Easter.<br /><br />Second way, cashing out? Hmmm... if you want your money back, you should buy a reasonably priced ounce of weed. Make some new friends. Unload said zip. Cash+Interest.<br /><br />Remember to account for the time investment when cashing out. How much time did it take you to learn how to use TOR? SR? Mt Gox? Bit laundry? and so on and so on... Also include the amount of time you spent watching the mailbox, checking your rear view, the new routine of grooming yourself, and preventative maintenance. Was it a WOFTAM? I hope not, because if it was, then you just drained the economy of productivity. Think about that... if you&#039;re not benefiting from SR, both socially and financially, then it truly is a drain and the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is justified, even if it is only ever so slightly, an infinitesimally small increment toward Rightness.So when you get stoned out of your mind this Easter (or with your Matzoh during Passover or abstinence during Lint or your prayer during Ramadan), don&#039;t forget to inspect your life. <br /><br />The unobserved life is not worth living, and the life that drains society is a life wasted. Reach for your maximum human potential, and happiness will reach back.
