				I know there are a lot of us accessing SR through TOR <br />I also know that a lot of newbies find it hard to get there head around TOR as it is slightly more involved than say getting to google or facebook <br />Im just wondering now that google are indexing the SR , is there anybody using the onion.to address which is being indexed by google .<br />This is obviously dangerous practice and i will not be doing it , Im just curious <br />

				I don&#039;t know how many do, I don&#039;t though. That absolutely has to do with the fact that I know how to and have no issue on any of my devices. Though, reading tutorials I don&#039;t think they pose that much of a true difficulty, and the tor browser bundle makes at least the initial steps pretty simple. If you want to go all the way, it gets harder, but the first steps are hardly tough.

				The Tor Browser Bundle isn&#039;t any harder to understand or use than downloading Firefox or Chrome.&nbsp; I&#039;d say that if someone can&#039;t figure that out, they probably can&#039;t order on here safely anyway, and should do a lot of forum reading before they get started.

				If you use onion.to you should be bodyslammed through a cactus. Stupid noobs who want to buy drugs online and yet won&#039;t take a second to protect their anonymity. It&#039;s not that hard..

				I agree its not that hard to use the TOR browser bundle, but having said that speaking to some of the people on here makes you think how they managed to bundle the small amount of intellect together to get here .<br />maybe they used the .to gateway ?? who knows&nbsp; <br />It would be good not to have .to access

				You can&#039;t block onion.to access, onion.to uses TOR and just basically retransmits it to you, so you can&#039;t be accessed through TBB but not through onion.to.<br />I agree with Drug Ape that there&#039;s seemingly a lot of people using onion.to... Even a vendor had onion.to links on his profile so..
