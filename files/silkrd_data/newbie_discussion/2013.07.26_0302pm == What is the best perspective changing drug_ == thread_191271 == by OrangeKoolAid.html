				Actually, Lexapro (not even contraband!) did me well, but it definately didn&#039;t get you high, and if tahes at least 2 years to gdet a noticablr change. But that is not what we&#039;re talking about,is it? Salvia D. has gaused me to do an instant 180 on my behavior (in a very goos wahy; I&#039;m learning the DMY ropes now, so to speak, and it could be another life-changer, but I&#039;m going slow.<br /><br />Some folks mentined mushruooms - Pcylosibin (sp) id just an atom or two differnt drom DMT,and both have been frported ar &quot;life changing&quot;, &quot;religious&quot; in nature (spirityal awakening&quot;, and bot have caused the &quot;there&#039;s someone behind me&quot; feeling onuder lab conditions.<br /><br />LSD was exactly what I thought it wuold be - no less,but no more. But mostly I&#039;ve toked copious amounts of weed for&nbsp; 27+ years, daily or weeklym&nbsp; &nbsp;|D<br />

				The first drug that did it for me was cannabis. I smoked way to much and it really opened me up and let me see the world from a different point of view.<br /><br />Then there was shrooms. It showed me the beauty of the world we live in and how we as humans take it for granted.<br /><br />Next was LSD. A completely life changing experience which has had me questioning reality ever since.<br /><br />Next on my list is DMT which I will be receiving from my postman shortly ;)<br /><br />

				From extensive experience I would nominate LSD and MDMA as the best to make changes.<br /><br />Some variables include how you ingest it and when during the trip to start reprogramming.<br /><br />Has anyone ever dropped windowpane in their eyeball? I&#039;ve done it several times.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; &nbsp; Not for the faint of heart or mentally weak individual.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Didn&#039;t read the thread (sorry), but I&#039;m sure everyone has already said L.&nbsp; Low doses are good just to stimulate thinking.&nbsp; Don&#039;t have the reference but I think people are generally more productive up to two weeks after dosing.&nbsp; Some one look it up for me... cause I gotta go!<br /><br />Also DMT and mushrooms... just hallucinogens in general I think.

				Like everyone else, I have to agree that LSD and/or shrooms are the best for changing perspective. But it all comes down to set and setting. Pretty much any drug mixed with the right people and location can really help to change your perspective.
