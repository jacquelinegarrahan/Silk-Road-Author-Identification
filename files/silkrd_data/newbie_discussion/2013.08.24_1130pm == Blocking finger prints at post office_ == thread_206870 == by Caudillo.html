				Anyone have any suggestions? I mean you can&#039;t wear gloves all year round, I was thinking band aids on each finger tip but that could luck funny if they keep noticing too. As always would love to hear your suggestions.<br /><br />

				If you are that concerned you can burn them off with acid or brush supper glue over your fingertips.

				Try wearing those plastic &#039;witch&#039; fingers you can buy for hallowe&#039;en - pretend you&#039;re a hag ;-) if you wanted to go the whole hog, you could wear a hooded cloak over your hunched figure and occasionally offer a poisoned apple?

That way no finger prints on the package, I think this is what your worried about right?

				1morestranger - genius solution.<br /><br />I agree that I doubt the post office would fingerprint your packages. But I assume that it pays to be paranoid in this game, and what you suggest is the ideal workaround. Take note, OP!<br />

There was another thread where people were wondering if LE would order stuff to figure out vendors&#039; stealth, etc. I think they would be dumb not to and this would be one good reason. Maybe run it through their database and try to get a lucky &quot;hit&quot;. How much you wanna bet a most of these sellers have a criminal record and have been fingerprinted? In most countries those prints are all cataloged going way back and are easily searchable. If i were a vendor I would wipe everything spotless. For them I should think paranoia would be a virtue.

				Don&#039;t use post office - easiest solution. Too risky anyway.<br /><br />Also, may not realize it but they don&#039;t need just the tip of your finger they can identify you with prints anywhere on your hand.
