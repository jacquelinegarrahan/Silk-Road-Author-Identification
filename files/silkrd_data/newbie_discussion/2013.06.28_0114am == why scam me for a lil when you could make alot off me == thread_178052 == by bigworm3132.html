				I made two small purchases and haven&#039;t gotten either of them. Maybe they will show up some day but it&#039;s been a while. I FE&#039;d one as required since I am new and it wasn&#039;t any amount of money I would lose sleep over. They must need it a lot more than me if they will burn me over 50 bucks.&nbsp; Deposited some money with BitInstant to get some more coins to try with better vendors and BI screwed me over too. Starting to think this just wasn&#039;t meant to be. I must have the worst luck in the world or there must be a lot of scammers to filter through. If I don&#039;t get my BI deposit I guess I am done with this little venture. Which is sad because I am here to buy and be as easy to deal with as possible.
