				Easy.&nbsp; In 1986 they changed the law and the severity of your charge when caught with LSD was calculated by the weight of the LSD.&nbsp; A dose of LSD is small and blotter paper is lightweight so it is the safest and easiest way to possess and distribute LSD.&nbsp; Gellies weigh a lot more. ;)<br /><br />No one wants charged for trafficking LSD. ;D
