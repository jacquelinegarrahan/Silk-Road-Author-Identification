				Day 16 not blazing. Paranoia got the best of me and thought i&#039;d take a much needed break. Now I find myself sitting here with a gram of K, thinking WDF am I doing posting shit on the SR forum trying to get my post count up? JESUS CHRIST. <br />Anyone who sees this looking to also get their post count up or just equally bored? give me some banter or maybe its k hole time..<br /><br />

				Unfortunately I had a pretty serious neck, shoulder operation and have only just gained 30% mobility in my arm. Execise always helped in the past but now im pretty unactive sitting around on the computer not going out too much. When I have mates round to chill they all blaze ( I dont want to just hide from it or I learn nothing) but the timing of this break couldnt of been worse. <br /><br />What do you mean nitrogen? <br /><br />I gave in an smoked a one skin, last night. Feel a little guilty about it cuz i was way past the two week point but I guess continueing to stop again from this point is part of the long term challenge. <br /><br />Any other tips for quitting weed? its mainly have time to unwind without the use of blazing that is a major problem, its very hard to stop working until im tired enough to sleep so stress levels are high. <br /><br />The main thing is I dont want to replace it with alcohol, increased cigarette smoking or any other drugs.. without being able to exercise it is getting pretty damn boring. I have vivid dreams every night about weed haha its actually quite difficult but im in a good mentality to quit for once. I have never managed more than a week in the past and usually need to go on holiday to achieve any real break. <br /><br />Thanks for all the support and input!

				I gave up for three months recently and it did me a lot of good. Now I only smoke a vape at night and never/rarely have any in the day. Do exercise , keep busy , chat to friends. Do all those things that are difficult when you are stoned , read , learn something new etc. good luck

				Sorry I just say the bit about your neck , can you still walk ?. Personally I don&#039;t like hanging around the house. Getting out is always a good idea.

				Yes I can walk, but exercise other than basic physio is out of the question.. no sport, running, swimming etc. and sleeping without weed is hard enough let alone pain from the surgery! I have tramadol on pescription for it but after a while of taking that it isnt doing me any favours and have decided to stop any pain killers.. after a while you just cant eat or think properly its not worth it.. <br /><br />but yeah reading has helped sleeping a lot, after two weeks it got a bit easier and im sure after 30 days it will be better, but I am looking at 3-6months for full recovery then jogging, swimming or whatever will be come an option. <br /><br />As you guys must know, if you have a group of friends who socialize by smoking weed it makes it quite hard. Anti-drug campaigns recommend switching friend groups but fuck that! I value my friendships more than anything so I guess its just adapting to new thought patterns. <br /><br />Im going to write a new list today of all possible distractions to keep my mind active, but as I said the hardest thing is once it gets to 10pm at night after a hard days working on websites and various things I really need to unwind.. I am yet to find a true way of relaxing before bed other than reading but this can go on for hours so really affects the sleeping pattern. <br /><br />Maybe I need a natural sleep remedy for the time being, just very worried about creating a new routine with another substance as this would completely defeat the point. <br /><br />Any more advice much appreciated and again cheers to everyone who&#039;s added to this post.

				2CBEATS are you a cigarette, or nicotine user? im hoping quitting fags will be my next challenge as I think I need to kill off the whole smoking experience really, that is half the addiction. <br /><br />Let me know any pointers you got, cheers.

				Vicious circle really isnt it.. I am the same with diazapam makes quitting anything much easier but I unfortunately fell in love with the combination of weed and valium so now taking that makes me wana blaze a lot.. guess only time will tell.. <br /><br />Good luck with the opiates though.. they can be an evil bitch!

				I guess if your a person prone to the worlds vices, whether its drugs, gambling, or whatever else you will always find it easy to fall into these patterns. <br /><br />I suppose with weed it is just one of the easiest to form habits around as daily smoking doesnt have to much of affect on your daily life... thats until the paranoia catches up with you. Many people never get negative affects from paranoia but after dealing for a couple years I have more than enough reasons to be paranoid.. hence the break. <br /><br />Well im signing off now, Ill check the forum tonight. Take it easy everybody have a sick weekend!
