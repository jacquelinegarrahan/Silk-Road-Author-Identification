				BitInstant (Cash&gt;Walmart&gt;Moneygram) &gt; CoinCleaner &gt; SR<br /><br />Bitinstant was exactly that - instant. Not hearing anything about CC receiving or passing on to SR. Been ~hour since BitInstant says it sent.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Seems to be pretty easy. Follow directions on BitInstant site. I think I probably should have sent them into a wallet first before laundering...

				I have been using cash payment/walmart to bitinstant to SR wallet. If you go to walmart grab the blue moneygram slips and put the info. from the zipzap payment slip you got from bitinstant right onto the blue form. Bring it to customer service at walmart and they put your personal info. off of the blue moneygram slip into there computer. Upon future visits you give them the tel. number and your info. comes right up. They don&#039;t ask for ID and since you aren&#039;t doing anything but buying bitcoin it&#039;s all perfectly legal. Your choice whether or not to use you&#039;re real name or not. Seems pretty easy to me. Good luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

Since MoneyGram doesn&#039;t ask for ID, it is highly unlikely that the employees will take it upon themselves to ask. Unless MoneyGram policy changes, I would simply confront the employee with &quot;It never asked for my ID when I have done this before...&quot; or &quot;I did not bring my ID with me. I have never needed it.&quot;

				I just use the smaller money gram locations, but, it is super easy to use a fake name most of the time. You are not receiving money, so, no need for an ID.

				Check out the site zipzap. Thats who you actually end up paying. Anywhere listed on there site as payment options will work for you. I think CVS is on the list. Walmart too.....which is everywhere at least where I live! No ID required.
