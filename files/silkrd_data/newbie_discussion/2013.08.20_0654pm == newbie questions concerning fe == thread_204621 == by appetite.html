				HI er hello,<br />&nbsp;I have a couple of questions concerning fe.<br />have made my first purchase&nbsp; today and am currently waiting for my deliveries&#039; status to change, its currently processing.<br />in the sellers policy they state that new users will be requested to fe. feedback is very positive with 300+ transactions in the last year. some feedbacks state that they have fe&#039;d too. <br /><br />am assuming that the rep of the seller is good and that they will require me to fe as its first purchase. infact i looked around and most sellers of my specific product in my country stated in their policy that fe was required for under 5 transactions.<br /><br />YET i keep reading that fe-ing is not a good idea. am currently balancing this up in my head and waiting for my order to change status in the mean time.&nbsp; i must say that i am eager to receive my purchase too.<br /><br /><br />please can someone advise me, not sure what to do if all the sellers are stating fe necessary for first purchase.

				FE is almost never a good option. Never do it. You&#039;re fucked if you never get your shit.

				If you have no transaction history, you may be required to FE by many vendors.&nbsp; This can be circumvented however by purchasing low price listings like movies or lotteries in order to boost your number of transactions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a lottery going right now.&nbsp; Check me out.

				It&#039;s simply not true that most vendors will ask newbs to FE. Find another vendor. I did. I&#039;ve made 5 orders with no FE.

				The risk in FE is if the vendor scams/selective scams/you never get the product then you will not be able to get a refund through the resolution center. Not all FE requests are a scam, and FE is not the only type of scam you can become a victim of.

Also stay away from thurgood jenkins greasy ass.

				If you&#039;re worried about FE find another vendor that will ship out small quantities to new members with no FE requirement
