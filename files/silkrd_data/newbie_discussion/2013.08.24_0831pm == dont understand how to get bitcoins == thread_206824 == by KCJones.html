				Well you can&#039;t get the cheapest way with all that but you can use virwox and you make an account then deposit funds. You can use your card for that. Fill out the information correctly or it won&#039;t work. Next there&#039;s a link on the left hand side tht says usd/ssl transfer all your usd to ssl (linden$) then click on BTC/sll and transfer all your sll to BTC. This is by far the easiest cause you can do it all in a matter of 10 minutes or less. There&#039;s just fees and stuff though. Like I put $75 worth of funds in and got $70 worth of bitcoins out of it all but hey. It&#039;s still easy and works :) good luck. Just message me if you have more questions

				How save is it, if you buy bitcoins normally over sepa or any other way. Then send it over 2 e-wallets in the mixer (bitcoin fog) and finally in the SR account. Its untrackable?

				To keep your name out of it you can use bitcoin brokers and deposit cash into other peoples bank accounts and have the BTC sent to any # you want without ever giving your real name.

				I heard news that they were rolling out BitCoin ATMs in certain parts of the world... street machines where you can deposit cash and have your wallet credited. Anyone know about these and where they might be placed (if they&#039;re still going ahead)?

				I use localbitcoins.com, over the counter bank deposit with no ID needed. Not sure I&#039;d want to buy with a credit card and send to my SR wallet. Yeah they get tumbled but why take an extra risk? YMMV!

				My broker doesnt like a account to account deposit even though he knows me , hell he fronts me 1000 at a time, but doesnt like me to do account to account transfer, think it was along the lines of someone depositing and then can dispute it and locks the account up.&nbsp; Some people do it though you jus have to find one... easiest way is to buy a Vanilla reload, or reloadits at walgreens........ MoneyPaks are getting harder and harder to mess with

				localbitcoins.com is a very good site, i&#039;ve used it over 10 times and I trust it a lot. Never has any problems at all, it also uses full escrow and rating systems so it&#039;s hardly likely you will get scammed!<br /><br />Bank transfer is the most preferred method on it.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />MILKY

				In case that i buy from localbitcoins.com and buy something with that coins. Someone maybe could track the coins to the localbitcoin seller and he knows my name and bank account because i bought that coins from him. Is that possible or should I use bitcoin Fog before i sent that money to SR?

				Of course, the other method is to earn them in the first place. Never have to buy. Course, doing that on SR is impossible, as there&#039;s a $500 bond to stump up first xD (still saving up... shouldn&#039;t be long now &#039;til I&#039;m rocking the writing scene)
