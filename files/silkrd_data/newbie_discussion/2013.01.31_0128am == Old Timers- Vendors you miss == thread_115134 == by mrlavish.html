				For those of you like me, who are long time SR users just not very active on the forum. Who are some vendors you miss?<br /><br />1- Pharmville- those guys were awesome, the had everything, awesome OC OXY pills, great prices, and killer shipping and customer service. It&#039;s a shame they took a break and never came back. I just finally deleted them from my &quot;fan&quot; page.<br /><br />2. Nucleo- Now I know he&#039;s still around, but only for those in the know, unfortunately I never purchased from him, but now I wish I had as he sells a product I now do.

				I know this is a newbie thread, but like me there has to be some longtime SR users who just really never posted in the forum. No one else?

Pharmville crushed that #1 slot month after month like a boss. He WAS silk road for a bit there in the early days. He had a cult-like following too, I gotta hand it to him.

Actually I&#039;ve got a large amount so I won&#039;t have any problem supplying all you guys domestically well into the future. My prices for 5g are still the cheapest domestic option you can find, and I take a lot of time to ensure your product is delivered safely, using vac-sealing, MBBs, and incredibly detailed stealth that will not reveal the product to any prying eyes.<br /><br />Happy rolling!

				Iwong2961 always came through for me with his cocaine. It was priced just right. None of the ridiculous $120 dollar grams like there are tons of. It was $74 a gram and an eight ball for $216! Don&#039;t know why he left the road but he will be missed!!<br /><br />
