				No vendors that I have seen have had adderall 30mg or even 20mg at a fair price. Fair for me is $5 (street price). There are not even vendors with it being $8 a pill. Why is this? It makes no sense compared to all the other drugs.

				Because i&#039;m not a kid whos parents got him a adderall script, and he managed to sneak a few away. This is a business. Every little thing costs money. I would make NOTHING after I paid my expenses. You think we just sneak these off the back of the truck?

				I&#039;m torn here!<br /><br />I love the straw man fallacy rebuttal, I have been using it a lot on here!<br /><br />However<br /><br />Coachella is right,&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you can grow those lovely addys in your backyard!&nbsp; The prices on SR are what the market dictates.&nbsp; Trust me I have been searching high and low.&nbsp; Even when I buy it on the street it rarely goes for $5 a pill, even when friends are hooking me up!&nbsp; Eventually that $5 a pill hook up will run out, actually it runs out fast, as soon as your friend realizes they can sell it for much more!

				My 20s cost nearly $170 a bottle without insurance. Why would they be cheaper for someone buying them illegally?

				i think it comes down to&nbsp; &nbsp;d e m a n d.&nbsp; &nbsp;you arent competing with other broke-ish students/friend groups on sr, you are competing with a lot of wealthy individuals with stressful jobs that dont mind paying up to 15$ per 20 mg, at all, who are turning to SR as a last resort. and with the risk vendors take doing what they do, I can&#039;t blame them for wanting to cash in on this rare opportunity.
