				Hospital Grade Liquid LSD<br /><br />I&#039;ve had my fair share of drug induced Psychosis but nothing compares to those potent little serotonin invaders.<br /><br />Over 10 years ago now went to some 60&#039;s dress up party had plenty to drink along with half a G of meth <br /><br />Someone&nbsp; pulled out of the woodwork potion bottle Liquid LSD soaked&nbsp; paper towel twice&nbsp; put that in my mouth the rest is history,<br /><br />Apparently I was convulsing out the&nbsp; front of the house rolling around mates put me in a car I refused to breath until Fred&nbsp; wound the window down&nbsp; I took a deep breath.<br /><br />Got put on a drip in hospital I think my heart rate was high.... blood pressure low or the other way round.<br /><br />Needed to go to the toilet couldn&#039;t be bothered moving so just pissed the bed. The nurse asked if I was aware of wetting myself. I said No which was a lie then she put me in adult nappies.<br /><br />Early morning was asked&nbsp; what my name was, address e.t.c. answered all these my good mates picked me up all good.<br /><br />On the way home was thinking I just been to hospital but weirdly didn&#039;t give a second thought as to Why?<br /><br />For the next month really scattered light sleeping pattern.....I love and adorn&nbsp; mushrooms very well but LSD is one drug that can definitely make you live the life of the mad hatter&nbsp; in One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#039;s nest

				Although this technically does not count, I think it&#039;s worth sharing. I recently had a close call with 1,4B and GHB combined. It was so stupid and I&#039;m embarrassed that I got so cocky with dosing. There is absolutely no excuse for my utter STUPIDITY and arrogance. <br /><br />I took 3.5 ml 1,4B and 4.5 g GHB. Usually I take an anti nausea, but for some reason I didn&#039;t. One moment I was completely fine and alert and the next minute I&#039;m literally nearly choking on my vomit. If someone wasn&#039;t with me there is no doubt in my mind I would&#039;ve aspirated. That morning when I kept redosing I just kept think that I could smoke a bit of meth to prevent me from &quot;G-ing&quot; out. My thought was that I would be able to feel the heavy sedation creeping up on me. I was wrong.<br /><br />I was cuddling one morning with my SO who didn&#039;t know I took anything. I feel asleep while cuddling in the middle of a movie (at home). When he went to get up at the end of the movie I was wasn&#039;t responding at all. He kept slapping and shaking me with little to no response. I started vomiting and convulsing so he called the paramedics. When I heard that the paramedics had arrived I managed to pull together a sliver of coherence. I kept blacking in and out of consciousness/coherence, gave the wrong birth date and kept insisting that I was fine. I told them that I was on a new &quot;supplement.&quot;&nbsp; ::) Ultimately, I refused to go to the hospital because I knew that the effects would wear off soon enough and I was terrified of being drug tested at the hospital. I would&#039;ve literally tested positive for just about every major category of drugs. I don&#039;t appear to be your typically druggie and I don&#039;t want to be outed.<br /><br />The whole experience scared the shit out of my SO. He thought I was dying. That day, to date, will go down as the most embarrassing experience of my whole life. Not only did I vomit all over the front of myself, I also extended that pleasure to me SO. Sexy, no?&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />I&#039;m a researcher by heart so I never thought that something like this could happen to me. I thought that my natural tolerance to most drugs/knowledge would prevent something like this from happening, but I quickly found out that I am not the exception to the rule.

				You bad bad girl MsMETHTeMETHics.. survival of the fittest hey?&nbsp; that&#039;s a hefty dose of GHB what is 1,4B may I ask?<br />I&#039;m kinda scared to try GHB cause there is a fine line between bliss and ignorance. GHB in my hands would be in the wrong hands..Cat&#039;s have nine lives this little duck has&nbsp; crossed the road one too many times already.<br />My doctor put me on Baclofen which is supposed to stop one drinking it acts on the GABBA chemical messengers ...works as a muscle relaxant Anyhow the first time I tried them got a bit of a buzz was supposed to start on a quarter of a tablet 3 times a day and build up 2 tablets 3times a day. Well I dropped about 12 tablet in 6 hours straight off the bat. Convulsing badly spewing everywhere my sister just kept knocking on my door asking if I was overdosing should she&nbsp; call an ambulance whilst at the same time I was trying to get some speed delivered to my house. Luckily I was that out of it I couldn&#039;t even move just kept making weird noises to try and null the pain ..thankfully incapable of answering&nbsp; my cell and walk outside and pick up my order for white goods. <br />The truth is prescription meds cause a huge amount of overdoses even when used properly.. a good example is opiates.<br /><br />The Vendor BlueGiraffe sells moxy GHB would love to try some

				Holy spit bank sounds like we had very similar experiences. I too made weird noises I could not control. It&#039;s a really humbling experience when you go through something like that. It clarifies just how &quot;in control&quot; you really are. Hope you&#039;ve fully recovered from your experience. I was pretty much fully functional aside from some stomach upset about 4 hours after the paramedics left.<br /><br />More experienced GHB users feel free to correct. 1,4b is an analogue to GHB. In my experience, it produces a stronger drunk feeling than GHB. GHB has a slower onset and does not last as long as 1,4b. Personally I experience more nausea with 1,4. In the US 1,4 is still legal, but it&#039;s considered a watched substance. In the future I know that if I want to take 1,4b then I have to take an anti nausea med.<br /><br />Despite my less than pleasant experience I do not plan from abstaining from G in the future. I believe all drugs have their own sets of pros and cons. The key is not being an idiot like I was&nbsp; ::). The aphrodisiac, tingling erotic body high is incredible. I&#039;m not sure why it doesn&#039;t receive more attention.

				You got me sold on the idea .. Coal powered steaming G train all the way Ms McMETH chooo chooo chooo choooo choooo<br />Indeed a weathered&nbsp; humble pie close encounters,&nbsp; visions of&nbsp; light at the end of the tunnel<br />The only thing I got out of drug counselling was the question &quot; Do you take drugs because you feel down? Why would you do that? I asked.. that don&#039;t make sense to me ...the more zest I have for living the more&nbsp; invincible.. more likely to&nbsp; stumble....&nbsp; fall back into that dark, dark matter I keep ploughing with that tractor. I eventually climb out feet planted square on&nbsp; terra firma unknowingly still&nbsp; sowing the seeds of destruction&quot; picture the ending&nbsp; of a scanner darkly there&#039;s some groovy tunes right there!<br /><br />&quot;Imagination is more important than Knowledge&quot; Einstein<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s not that drugs make you more creative just that people who take drugs tend to more creative&quot;<br /><br /><br />Might as well make these 50 posts count for thirty&nbsp; something

				I&#039;ve only once come close, thank god. I decided to try taking some supplements before dosing on LSD. My bad. Turns out the supplements kicked the LSD up a couple of notches and I had to walk home through town on a Sunday afternoon. I kept imagining losing my shit in public and being arrested and my family finding out, etc. You know, all the stuff you really don&#039;t want to worry about during a trip. Anyways, somehow held my shit together and made it home. I spent the rest of the afternoon babbling like a madman and getting a much better idea what psychotic breaks must feel like. I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t nearly as bad as bankofgt&#039;s experience, but it nonetheless reminded me how respectful you should be with these chemicals.<br /><br />Keep safe travellers, and give some thought to having a sober sitter around when you try new shit.

				MDPV. Panic attack. I was convinced I was in cardiac arrest.<br /><br />MDPV is a strange drug, and not a terribly useful one. Smoked, the first couple of times are like magic. Beautiful, clear-headed euphoria, aphrodiasis. But it burns out something in your brain, rapidly downregulates some receptor, or something, and all the good stuff goes away after a few days of use. If you try to get the nice effects back by going up on the dose, all you get is anxiety, and if you push it to far, you get a weird panic experience like mine. Some people have had visual hallucinations.<br /><br />Recreationally, MDPV is a useless and somewhat hazardous drug. A shame, because the first time you use it, you think you&#039;ve found the holy grail. Nope.

				I haven&#039;t had to go to the hospital myself although one time I did have a weird reaction to weed + other meds I was on at the time where I was in a state of sheer, unavoidable terror for 8 hours. I walked it off, mostly. <br /><br />One time I had to accompany my young relative to the ER as they had somehow gotten a hold of a number of benzos that, in the average adult, would be the equivalent of taking 15 moderate-dose pills. mg/kg, it gets pretty high when the person is a toddler and they don&#039;t weigh much.&nbsp;
