				I was wondering if anyone has had the 150ug blotters from 4sale?<br /><br />If you have please could you let me know what you thought to the quality of the product and if you think the dose stated to be correct.<br /><br />A trip report would be amazing! I have had a look through the avengers thread and there doesn&#039;t seem to be any mention of this vendor and they are not in the vendor list neither.

				^Same here- I just took a chance on him. I placed an order from 4Sale on Jan 16, but still haven&#039;t received it a full week later. Also, I said I would test it for him if he could spare tab, and he didn&#039;t reply...

Especially if its international. If you are wanting good quality LSD I would recommend EnterTheMatrix; I&#039;ve received some of his 250ug tabs, and they were probably the best trips I&#039;ve ever had.

				I know, I&#039;m still keeping my hopes up for 4Sale, especially considering that part of the wait has been over the weekend, but the signs don&#039;t look too great so far. I&#039;ve heard good reviews about his product which is the only thing keeping me hopeful. I&#039;ll definitely be posting a trip report on 4Sale&#039;s review thread after I try his. But honestly guys, we should stick with OK+ vendors (from The Avenger&#039;s thread).

				Honestly I&#039;d just try to stick to the LSDA recommendations. It can certainly limit your choices, but in my book that&#039;s a lot better than getting scammed or worse, getting NBOMe-x or some other RC instead of good ol&#039; LSD.

				I ordered a single 150ug tab from 4sale a little over a week ago. It was my first purchase on SR. I dropped it last Wednesday.<br /><br />I saw and thought wonderful aciddy things. Dimming/brightening colours in waves and wavy visual distortions. Didn&#039;t get any tracers this time. But got quite an unpleasant and tense body load during all this, which put a damper on the experience. For the most part it was positive, but at times very uncomfortable.<br /><br />The psychedelic style anticipation started about 30 or 45 minutes in. I peaked at around T+1:45 to T+3:45. At about T+5:30 I could still swear that some JPEGs were GIFs. By T+8:00 I mostly felt normal and spent time with my mates who had no idea I&#039;d had a session!<br /><br />4sale&#039;s communication was great though, they reply quickly and professionally. We traded under full escrow. The product arrived quickly (domestic) in discreet packaging.<br /><br />I&#039;m not an experienced tripper so didn&#039;t know if my body load experience was because of bad acid or not enough acid. Or what. I&#039;d be interested to hear other experiences of 4sale&#039;s LSD.

				Also I get pretty manic about writing stuff down when I&#039;m on acid. The ink looked like it was slipping off the page. I take that as a good sign!<br /><br />And I couldn&#039;t tell if people on BBC Big Questions looked and sounded trippy or were genuinely fucked up.

				I took 2 of these tabs. After an hour i started to feel the affects. Me and my friends went through about 2 hours of laughing at almost anything but then everything went strange and it was like every1 in the room was on different wave lengths and all the conversation came to a compete stop and it was like we wasn&#039;t even friends anymore lol we all just sat there thinking about deep stuff and it wasn&#039;t very enjoyable. I had no visuals at all but neither did any of my mates. There was a guy doing it for the first time and he said that the 25i he took a couple of weeks before was a lot stronger. I used to do a lot of acid and i cant compare these trips to any i have took in the past. <br /><br />I did watch a film near the end of the trip and got completely immersed which was good as it made the film feel a lot more exciting.

				I took half of 4Sale&#039;s 150ug hit this past Tuesday for the first time. I was chasing an “ego death” as a cure to my long battle with social anxiety. After two long hours, I had hardly felt anything, and thought that I had only talked myself into feeling anything up until that point. So I took the other half. Right when I did, I felt it hit me all of a sudden. I was in awe.<br /><br />Throughout the experience, I kept coming back to a certain feeling that felt so second-nature to me. It was pure joy/happiness/fun. I felt that I had lost touch with this natural feeling for too long from years of conforming to a rigid pattern. The re-realization of this feeling still hasn’t left me after about four days. Although I don’t feel it as strongly now as during the trip, I now know what to look for in life. I’m much more sensitive to this feeling in my everyday life. This is the beauty in it. Maybe it is the goal of the cosmic game of consciousness- to experience this feeling of fun. <br /><br />I started to make much more loose word associations. At this point, I also started seeing the simplicity in the things the mind goes crazy over, which caused me to laugh from a very deep place. It also hit me that this substance helps to distance you from your thoughts, while smoking pot just makes the mind overactive.<br /><br />The days following the trip, I was living life mostly free from identification with any self-made identity. I would see the identities come and go, or quickly snap out of it if I did happen to fall for it. For the first time, I felt facial muscles relax after years of tension, and it felt so relieving- my eyes, cheeks, forehead.&nbsp; I noticed muscles in the scalp area especially that were now relaxed on a regular basis, and it made me feel happy. Hopefully a few more doses will lessen the weakly resurfacing patterns of old behavior, and help completely relinquish identification with the mind.
