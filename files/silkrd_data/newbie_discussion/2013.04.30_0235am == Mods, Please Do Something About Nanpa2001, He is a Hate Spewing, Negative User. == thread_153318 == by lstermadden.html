				Hey guys and girls, I just had to make a post regarding this guy because I couldn&#039;t stand his crap anymore.<br /><br />Is it just me or is nanpa2001 one of the bigger trolls on these forums...<br /><br />By troll, I simply mean that he starts fights, and bashes others for either simply casting their opinions, or being &quot;stupid&quot; <br />in his eyes.<br /><br />He consistantly uses nasty language, racial slurs, anti-semetic remarks, and contanstly states phrases of Neo-Nazi&#039;ism.<br /><br />Half the bologna I have seen regarding Atlantis comes from this guy, and he doesn&#039;t stop.. he is there cheerleader all the way.<br />But I could care less if he uses Atlantis... But what bothers me is that he calls other users names and slurs just because they <br />don&#039;t feel comfortable using the site. It scares me to know that there are people as ignorant as he in this workd.<br /><br />One example that I can think off the top of my head is reply #7 on this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153153.0<br /><br />And I wish I had enough time now to look for a post I was reading today where he is calling someone a jew and saying heal hitler and shit..<br /><br />He is really discusting and if the mods can please do somthing about this guy, I think the entire forum will benefit from the negativity that <br />will no longer be spewing from nanpa2001&#039;s mouth.<br /><br />Thank you for hearing me out, and if anyone wishes to share more incidents that I didn&#039;t have time to list, please do so the mods<br />can see exactly how far this guy goes.<br />

				I would encourage you to check out this post and add him to your ignore list, if you&#039;d like to stop seeing his posts:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142898.0<br /><br />Otherwise, there&#039;s no rule here against being a &quot;hate spewing, negative user&quot; -- the only posts we delete are posts that are scams, bitcoin spam, or endanger someone.

				One of the beautiful things about Silk Road I&#039;ve found is that I&#039;m anonymous, and I can say whatever deranged and inflammatory shit that I&#039;d like. <br /><br />For example.<br /><br />1. The holocaust makes me horny. I would like to get some of those jew ashes and mix them with vaseline and I&#039;m sure it would make a fine sexual lubricant. <br /><br />Now, I find the prospect of this scenario deplorable, and by all means do I agree that Nazism is a warped philosophy, but just suck up the butthurt and don&#039;t feed the trolls. <br /><br />Anne Frankly, I think jew could lighten up a bit.
