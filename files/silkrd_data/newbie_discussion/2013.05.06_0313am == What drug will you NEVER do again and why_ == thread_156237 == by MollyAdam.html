				MDPV is the drug i will NEVER EVER lay hands on AGAIN. i had only 1 good experience with it and all my other times with it was complete shit...woke up paranoid all the time or went on 3-7 day binges on this shit with little to no sleep at all. worst times of my life...i would have fucking psycosis every fucking day. seeing shit during class and hearing shit during class. i remember one experience during my biology class where i had been up for 4 days on MDPV and began to see my teacher turn into different animals and talk to me and saw my class mates fall over in their chairs and die for no reason at all...<br />and the other reason...had a friend sent to the hospital just recently because of MDPV...had a near death experience...never again will i touch this shit.

				Shrooms. Because I have a phobia of vomiting and the only time I have ever done shrooms, there was a lot of vomiting. Totally turned me off ever trying it again.

				2c-e. i&#039;ve used it maybe 3 times and every single time it took me to a dark, terrifying and anxiety-ridden very weird place. the last time i used it i ended up having multiple seizures on my bedroom floor, convinced i was going to die. never again.

				MDMA because I took too way much and also it&#039;s not as great as people make it out to be. Even tried some 2c stuff. Whatever, no interest, maybe if there&#039;s a really weird analogue going about i&#039;ll do it.<br /><br />I had a bad time with PCP, but I&#039;d probably do that again, just watch my dose.<br /><br />Opiates, even the really nice ones are lame, but if I&#039;m gonna be perscribed it, I&#039;ma get drunk and take some. Or if I do do opiates again I&#039;m gonna take like, overdose levels. That&#039;s what it takes for me. Though i did quite enjoy fentanyl when I was in the hospital.<br /><br />Pot, might do again, but I lost interest in it.<br /><br />Nicotine, never again.
