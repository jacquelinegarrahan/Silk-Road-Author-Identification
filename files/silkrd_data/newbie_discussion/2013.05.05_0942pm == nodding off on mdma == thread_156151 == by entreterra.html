				I read in another post someone shouting troll at someone else who claimed they had fallen asleep after taking mdma. Well, that&#039;s not that farfetched of a notion. Has anyone else ever nodded off after taking mdma?<br />For me, mdma can be very, very sedating/relaxing, though not in an opiate/benzo sort of way. It has only happened to me once, but one time I took 170mg of very potent mdma and about 1.5 hours later took a little more orally and nasally. My total by that point was about 300mg and within 30 minutes, while lounging back in a chair and listening to music, i dosed off and woke up like 2 hours later.<br /><br />It was quite surprising that I fell asleep; and kind of disappointing because the peak was fading by the time I woke up. Interestingly it has only happened that one time. Other times falling asleep is IMPOSSIBLE.

				It is physically impossible for me to sleep on MDMA. Sounds like your shit was bunk.

				definitely not bunk, some of the most pleasant stuff I had had actually. Was the first time I had actually rolled in a long time. Some friends who took it said it felt like their first time and they took 120-130mg. It was an extremely mellow roll. <br /><br />With stuff I&#039;ve had recently, mostly off the road, I agree with you, it&#039;s tough to sleep even 10-12 hours after I take it. Like I said it was just the one time I nodded off, and was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.

				I&#039;ve been using MDMA 25+ years. I also find it to be somewhat sedating. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever fallen asleep immediately after the first dose but have definitely had this happen after re-upping after night of binging. The only time I have trouble sleeping after an mdma trip is if it&#039;s been cut with something.

				The most I take in one go will be about 300mg. After that I&#039;m so out of it that slipping into la-la land can *feel* like nodding off. ie. Eyes rolling back and yawning a lot etc..&nbsp; never actually fallen asleep though.

				The feeling I had was like what android describes: eyes rolling back, lala land. For a little bit before I actually fell asleep I would emerge from lala land to realize that I kept nodding into lala land. It was when the clock went from 12:30am to 2:30am that I realized I had totally fallen asleep for a little while. <br /><br />Actually come to think of it, my most recent time rolling I fell asleep too. This last time however, I had come down from an initial dose and about 7 hours later I took about .2g. In this case, before the .2g came on, I fell asleep. I woke up a couple hours later in a floaty, dreamy state. This is not quite the same thing as falling asleep during a roll, though it&#039;s interesting that I stayed asleep as the +7 hour .2g dose came on.

				Many times while rolling hard I&#039;ve felt like I was struggling to stay awake.&nbsp; A few times I stopped fighting to stay awake.&nbsp; I kind of going into limbo between wake and sleep but don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever actually fallen asleep.

				I nod off heavily on MDMA. Paticularly on Fred Lint/LL&#039;s brown sand. It&#039;s beautiful.<br />I typically lack motivation to move around. I usually find myself seated/laying and melted into wherever I&#039;m at. The world around me sort of disapears and I may or may not be deeply engaged in conversation/interest in those around me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had more stimulating rolls from suspect molly. Those experiences weren&#039;t necessarily all that enjoyable.<br /><br />I find methylone to be more stimulating but less introspective and empathogenic. More social imo, I&#039;m more liable to dance and chat with everyone, the world around me doesn&#039;t fade.<br /><br />Mephedrone, on the other hand, produces both a stimulating and deeply empathetic roll. There&#039;s a touch of nod but it&#039;s outweighed by excitement and stimulation. To be honest, oral mephedrone tends to produce the most enjoyable, well rounded social roll I&#039;ve experienced, and the ability to redose is a plus.

				like ketamine there are two different isomers of MDMA.&nbsp; I cant recall with accuracy which one does which, but one has a speedier feel, and another a trippier feeling.&nbsp; Ive had a couple people tell me about 150 mg doses made them so relaxed they could fall asleep.&nbsp; It depends on environment i feel.&nbsp; if you at a club the stimulation is everywhere, but if your just hanging out, i could see the sleepy effect.

				I go into a nod-like state, but not a nod in the opiates sense.&nbsp; Last night was the first time I got some pretty uncontrollable eye rolling action for an hour or 2.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure my general state and demeanor would look to someone else as if I was heavily drugged on a sedative.&nbsp; Just feels good to relax and sit back and not focus on anything for a few minutes.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think I would fall asleep but after the roll I don&#039;t feel ready for sleep...thats where the benzos and some beers come in handy&nbsp; ;D
