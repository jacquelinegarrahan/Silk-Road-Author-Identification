				I hate coinbase. Last week I made my first transaction on coinbase worth like $20 and apparently had to wait a week, and was supposed to get my BTC at 415 today. So I&#039;ve been checking impatiently to see if it maybe came early, but guess what? Its not coming! They fucking cancelled my transaction 10 minutes before I was supposed to get my coin. 10 fucking minutes.&nbsp; Could&#039;ve cancelled it earlier but they fuckin waited till the last possible minute for me to find a new source for bitcoins. I dont want to verify my shit anymore fuck all that, and localbitcoins doesn&#039;t have any local coin sellers that deal with anything under 1 bitcoin. <br /><br />What the fuck man....To everyone at coinbase you can all suck my fat cock and choke on it motherfuckin laggers. Fuck coinbase. Faggot bitches. Coinbase sucks.<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that Ive been waiting for my coin so I could order my shit and get high as fuck. Fuckers ruined my day/weekend.

				Im so pissed...they better be able to manually complete the transaction if they ever reply. What a great way to celebrate my 50th post...no bitcoins. Yay. Fuck my life and everything in it I just wanna go diving into the deep ocean until my lungs and ears rupture and blame it all on coinbase because they ruin lives.&nbsp; :(

				I didnt have any problems with coinbase other than having to wait a while. Did they give you a reason why they canceled your transaction? It seems like if your money is in the bank it shouldnt be a problem.

				Yea no they didn&#039;t scam me at all...Im pretty sure they are legit. They refunded me fully, its not even that that I was worried about(only 20$), Its the fact that I had to wait a week to get a tiny amount of bitcoin, and they couldnt even process it! That really pissed me off! Is there another service I can use guys that would maybe get me btc by tonight so I could order shit Tonight? Thanks in advance ppl.

				Coinbase worked fine for me and my first transaction was for over $600. Just don&#039;t use it with tor or you&#039;ll be flagged as suspicious and your order will be cancelled.

				Yep coinbase is whoring out their data to the fed.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they require verification on all customers if they don&#039;t use a debit card.

				Buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal. Just launder them a bit through blockchain or whatever before sending them to your SR address.
