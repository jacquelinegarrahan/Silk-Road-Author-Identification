				I just rec&#039;d my first order from SR vendor benzosource, he&#039;s an eastern europe vendor, but the prices are great, especially the deal he was able to give me (180 2mg kpins for $160 shipped) and the order arrived within 11 days of me making the order, a week from when they shipped it. that part is all great.<br /><br />However, the pills arrived outside of the blister paks as i had been promised, and while the stealth was okay for now, in the future i would not feel good about ordering at the same stealth level on a long period of time. <br /><br />He also shorted me a pill, which is not a big deal because of the deal I got, but the biggest problem I had is the pills were packaged horribly, even if the stealth method used WAS good (don&#039;t want to go into too many details) there needed to be a lot more work done as far as that goes to make me want to continue this on a long term basis. <br /><br />Because of the pkging, many pills were broken and even more had little chips of pill missing, which makes me frustrated because as they are not exactly well known benzos over here, it makes it even harder when there&#039;s not even a box or a bottle or ANYTHING that proves beyond doubt that they are what they said they were. again, not a gigantic deal, but i would have appreciated a heads up before shipping, and ESPECIALLY because they are generics, and random serbian generics at that. <br /><br />Overall I still gave a 5 because they arrived in good time and they look real and the price was by no means overly high (it was average or just above avg), and after taking 6mg i&#039;m not entirely sure they&#039;re as potent as they should be, but maybe that&#039;s the chips causing product to be lost-- a couple pills were almost a quarter gone, and then there were the ones with a couple little slivers gone, even if it&#039;s only 0.3mg from the pill, that adds up. Will comment further after I have a chance to use them some more when necessary.<br /><br />Personally i use benzos 90% for anxiety reduction, and 10% recreationally, generally when going out to big shows or anywhere with large crowds so i can relax and still enjoy myself even around tens of thousands of people.<br /><br />Anyway just a heads up for anyone thinking of ordering through him, i hope he tightens his ship up, he has a good opportunity to be a great source for people willing to go overseas for benzos. if he can match indian prices then the sky is the limit as far as i&#039;m concerned ;D<br /><br />well thanks for reading. and BS, if you want to get ahold to me to chat, if you have torchat send me your info and we can chat on there for sure.<br /><br />cheers, lucky<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just a thought but if you didn&#039;t mention this in your review BS may never know and nothing will change. Most of the reviews for BS are + so you probably should have mentioned the problems there as well. Leaving a 5 star rating with no comment will not help.<br /><br />Just trying to give some sage advice.

				I had a lot of problems with this vendor. Locked my money up in escrow for three weeks and wouldn&#039;t answer PM&#039;s and wouldn&#039;t update me with a tracker. Refunded in resolution and he told me it never shipped and his shipper robbed him. Had to get staff involved to fix my refund rate. <br /><br />I can honestly say I made a bad choice and should have bought elsewhere. Kob sells from Serbia I heard, but these Serbian vendors are fucking shady as hell.<br /><br />
