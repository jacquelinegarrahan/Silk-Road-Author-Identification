				First idea: you should mix it up...send it threw diffrent coin networks....to get it more anonymous....<br /><br />and untraceble....(its better as use it directly)<br /><br />after that you can transfer it right back to SM or BMR and buy stuff with it.<br /><br />Second idea: you get some fake ID&#039;s open up somewhere a Bank Accound and get payed out<br /><br />Third idea: keep calm ,....wait a little and just do what you want with your bitcoins...<br /><br />:) <br /><br />i would be really happy if you could send me 2 BTC for detailed information :)

				This actually happened to another buyer recently. Though i think that instance was a bit different, where as it was a vendors mistake, and it was like 30k in coin.<br /><br />Try your best to get it back to where it belongs, if nothing, then youve stepped in a huge pile of shit you lucky bastard.

				I dont have an answer for the source of the funds for you DUC but I do have an anon method of withdrawal. For the right price I would be willing to use my method to withdraw the funds but cannot think of a way to achieve the mutual trust I would need to use my assets and I can imagine you would need to part with the BTC as the method can take up to 5 business days. I would consider any ideas. I can envisage scenarios where no offense is committed in aus in the withdrawal of these funds.<br />PM me any questions if you would like to discuss further

				Like i said, this happens more often than one would think, with these fairly large sums of coin. Again, if no one claims it, or attempts to dispute it with you.. then youve made out like a bandit and it would only be right to put a good bit of that, id personally donate half of the total sum at the very least, back into the community.<br /><br />Shit youd still have what, like almost 8 grand to spoil your self with? Even if it was $100 youd be left with, it is free money that a higher power of some sort clearly wanted you to have. I suppose this shall show just how honest you are. If no one claims it, id be willing to bet my bottom dollar that just how selfless you are with that coin can possibly change the out come of your future. heh. <br /><br />Best of luck with all that. I really wish i was in your shoes right now, LOL. Much love

				Oh yeah good point about the wallet address! <br />If you share anything with me I will cash some out and use it for rent as I&#039;m struggling a bit lately. Also might get a bit of MDMA and then share the love with my friends. Might also send some back into this community as it&#039;s given me so much especially to the venders who lost money. Who knows! I&#039;m just thinking off the top of my head. <br />But seriously if you decide to share a few, absolute legend! :)<br /><br />Oh yeah and I lost nearly 400£ when SR went down! But I guess thats what I get for using the blackmarket. It may not seem a lot to you guys but for me that&#039;s a huge amount. :( Ah well. It could&#039;ve been a lot worse though!

Or you could literally make my entire life by sending me 5btc ;) , it&#039;s up to you haha. I will let you know what I spend it on if you decide that. <br />I just wish I didn&#039;t wipe my account that my back up address on it. Imagine if I got sent something to.. damn. Still can&#039;t believe you got like £9k just randomly, so lucky haha.

				I LOVE how at the first mention of anything free or donated, and every one and their grandmothers emerge from the wood works with their hands out, it really makes me LOL.<br /><br />TBH OP, you should share the blessing with those who did NOT ask for it and tease those who came in with their mits out to prosper off your good fortune... and just to show no bias on my part I DEMAND you give me FREE MONEY, NOW! LOL Much love man.

				Type your address into blockchain.info to see where your coins came from. If you want to send me some coins PM me and I&#039;ll send you my bitcoin address.

				Congrats to you I say Bud!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before feeling too guilty about it remember all the times you&#039;ve been ripped off and f$$$$d over by low c##ts with no job and no morals. If you cant find the owner then KEEP THE LOT for yourself and enjoy it, every now and then good people deserve a win. Good luck

				Just take it as a blessing. I doubt anyone will be hunting you down. Have fun buying things or cashing them in! Or like other people said, maybe donate to another black market. Either way, have fun with your new found capital!

				So doubting this is true, but hey, if it is, awesomesauce for you!&nbsp; Maybe consider giving back to some of the community that lost coin in the shutdown. Personally, I lost 6.25BTC, feel free to send them to 1BaVxjBA1mLyQQpcaizgHco59ZKp1vXcjN&nbsp; &nbsp;;)
