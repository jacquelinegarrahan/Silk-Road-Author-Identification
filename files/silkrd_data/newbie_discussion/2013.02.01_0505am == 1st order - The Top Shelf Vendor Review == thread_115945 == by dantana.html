				Just received my first SR purchase to test the variety of product around here. I had always wanted to try Super Lemon Haze and found a vendor named The Top Shelf who offered a sample size. Having no transactions I thought TTS might demand FE but no message after ordering. Very cool! <br /><br />I jumped right in after receiving and proceeded to have one of the best highs ever. We even made the mistake of smoking like my everyday, soon we in worthless condition. It&#039;s hilarious as I was suspect of the quality on SR - it can&#039;t be much different than what I score, wrong!<br /><br />Here is my review: <br /><br />Appearance: 6/5 Fat node, frosted coated in THC triches and golden hairs! Fluffy bud compared to my local but looked really really great! Weight about what I paid for but I didn&#039;t put such a sample on a scale, I&#039;m satisfied.<br /><br />Smell:&nbsp; 7/5 As soon as the pack was open a very strong lemon sort of aroma. Really nice smell, incredible really.<br /><br />Taste: 7/5 Very nice and smooth with a slight lemon taste. Enjoyed the velvety and straight citrus taste very much. <br /><br />Effects: 10/5 Warning this bud is not for beginners! My sweetie was couch locked from over medicating with 3 hits haha. I was in about the same shape as I continued to finish the small bowl.&nbsp; This 2 hr soaring upper body head chest eye fuckâ€¦high lasted almost 4hrs total. This should be a 1-2 hit sort of strain for avg mid users who smoke a regular basis. After over doing it, we were in a state of losing time and some functionality. I found myself fumbling through Youtube music and not commenting with my typing difficulties. What a blast LOL! This medicine does give one the munchies and I forced myself to put down the Keebler fudge stripes package after eating 10 in a row. We both needed to take a nap on the down but are already looking forward to the wake and bake... I think we will only take 1-2 hits this time and chill :)<br /><br />Potency: 10/5<br /><br />Packaging: 4/5 Nicely done, No smell, double packaged, looked pro - Needed some extra packing to stop product movement noise in package<br /><br />Shipping: 1/5 Marked in transit before sent. 11 days for a few states away domestic. Shit happens I understand and I bet I just hit a busy time.<br /><br />Communications: 3/5 No messages until I sent one out due to delay after 7 days or so. Pleasant but short message back saying sorry it was late and not to worry. I&#039;m sure I just got worried first order was in trouble but it was really late.<br /><br />BUY THIS PRODUCT!l I want to thank this TTS and I will definitely buy his product again.... especially if I can get some real weight at a reflective price. Treat yourself to a sample of this until he gets some larger listings. You won&#039;t be disappointed with the quality of the product from The Top Shelf - 5/5 stars!<br />

				Top Shelf is fucking amazing.&nbsp; The shipping speed was just two days and the weed quality... well... the Avidekel strain is something else.&nbsp; Top Shelf has a lifetime customer right here.
