				Hey everyone! I was just wondering about how to buy bitcoins. I really didn&#039;t see too much on it, although I am sure I missed it.<br /><br />Now, when you buy anything, isn&#039;t there going to be some sort of paper trail that could lead to your home? Even if it is shipped elsewhere?<br /><br /><br />Thanks! I look forward to being a part of this community!

				I would not worry about buying the BTC its not just SR that uses them gaming site&#039;s do also google it.<br /><br />mtgox is prolly ur best bet to go buy them, then transfer to bitcoin wallet then transfer to SR. if im wrong someone will update this post shortly.

				Post taken from Photonsounds from a similar thread I had made, I found it nice.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The easiest way I have found is<br />1) create a throwaway email (hushmail is a good one.)<br />2) order a BTC --&gt; email with Bitinstant and pay with moneygram with fake information.<br />3) put your coin in a throwaway wallet(such as blockchain.info)<br />4) ANONYMOUSLY send it to SR (blockchain.info has a built in fogger. but SR does also.)<br /><br />Steps 1 and 2 are NOT ACCESSED THROUGH TOR. Feel free to use a[n in country] proxy of some sort, good on you. But accessing this with tor, from what I have read, CAN draw attention to you...attention that you don&#039;t want in your life.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				depends what youre going to use them for, if you want to buy stuff off SR i would tumble them with bitcoin fog, if you are just using the coin to pay for the SR bond, then I wouldnt worry, just dont buy anything with your vendor account

				Thanks so much for the input guys! I still have yet to get the balls to order, but I will, and soon. Does everyone have bad feelings about having things sent to your home, or is a PO box safer? I mean, I do not plan on ordering tons of stuff, so I doubt the fuzz would go crazy over less than on oz of green.<br /><br /><br />Thanks again!
