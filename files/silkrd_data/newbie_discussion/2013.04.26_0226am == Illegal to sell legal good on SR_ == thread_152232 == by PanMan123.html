				This has been discussed many times. I always side with the fact that you are aiding a criminal organization because when you sell an item they get a percentage, which helps to support the organization.<br /><br />Chaos

				There is illegal stuff sold on eBay and kijiji sites too.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s an easy Defense to argue with a reasonable doubt that its beyond your control as a consumer at the site. It&#039;s proving the intent.&nbsp; The intent that you had, to buy drugs, conspire about drugs, etc.&nbsp; they can&#039;t prove that unless they witness the transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />The transaction that takes place is encrypted. Or should be. So the only evidence is encrypted.&nbsp; Unless you hang onto messages and shit. <br /><br />It&#039;s an easy defense to suggest you had no idea about the illegal stuff because you don&#039;t do that. You were looking at the other stuff.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s why that other stuff is here. Does anyone actually buy that stuff ?&nbsp; Clothes and shit?&nbsp; I guess.&nbsp; I like the electronics gadgets.

				Man, it&#039;s a market. Sell what you want. If you&#039;re a benefit to the road, you&#039;ll stick around. Remember: what&#039;s legal in your country might not be somewhere else…

				For example: on any given day (and if you know what you&#039;re talking about and not all shitty looking) can walk into a pharmacy in about 30 or so of the 50 US states and buy sharps without a script. You could even buy insulin if you needed, but usually just the points are what I need. <br /><br />Anyways, that also means about 20 states have junkies without access to cleans. Not to mention places where such things would certainly be just paraphernalia.
