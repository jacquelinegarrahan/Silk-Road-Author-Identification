				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Obviously I am a newb. I am hoping to make my first transaction on SR but obviously I need bitcoins. I was following the guide at the bellow adress (http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1br9ga/a_beginners_tutorial_to_ordering_on_the_silk_road/) and came to the point where I would need an email to open an account with mtgox.com and dwolla.com<br /><br />My questions are as follows:<br /><br />1. Can I use a throwaway email for registering on these sites? Something like this - https://mail.yandex.com/<br />2. Is this a good place to register an email account for use on SR - http://365u4txyqfy72nul.onion/mail/<br />3. What is the best place to buy bitcoins with Australian Dollars/Bank account?<br />4. Does anyone know of any mdma/ecstasy vendors in Latin America?<br /><br />Even if you are a n00b with minimal experience, any help would be appreciate. I really want something other than cocaine and alcohol on my weekends.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Anon.

				Ok if you are in australia stay away from gox etc try spendbitcoin pretty quick and just need to deposit cash at a bank do not transfer funds electronically they wont accept <br /><br />i use coinjar.io they were a lot better then some fuckwit used fake bank accounts to buy BTC now you need to verify yourself before EFT but well worth it and fast <br /><br />Any more questions pm or ask here

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m with Cryngie, Coinjar.io is the way to go. By far the lowest fees in Aus and they are super easy to use. Granted, as cryngie said it used to be a lot easier but it&#039;s still not that bad. You need to use your real details to get it all set up properly. If this freaks you out (it shouldn&#039;t, but if it does) then you will have to go and pay the exorbitant fees at spendbitcoins.com.<br /><br />As long as buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal in Aus, you should be sweet. you can even transfer straight to SR if you want, I know of plenty people that do. Just make sure to get yourself a new bitcoin address before and after every deposit. If you think you&#039;d like to take a little extra caution you can uses services such as bitcoinfog. This will enduce extra fees and SR does something analogous to it anyway. It&#039;s up to you<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Annex<br /><br />P.s. What is this &#039;something other&#039; that you&#039;re looking for?
