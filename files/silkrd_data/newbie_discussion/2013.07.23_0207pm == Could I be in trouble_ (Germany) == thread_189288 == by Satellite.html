				Hey everyone,<br /><br />so I placed my first order ever on SR (10 xtc pills) and the vendor (domestic, good rank) told me it shipped a week ago.<br />Usually, domestic deliveries take 1-2 days in Germany. Now it&#039;s been a week and still nothing. In their feedbacks, many people say that their orders arrived after only 10 days in the US or in Australia, so I&#039;m getting a little nervous here. The vendor told me that it is strange indeed for a domestic order to take this long.<br /><br />Could it be that my package got intercepted? Did anyone make similar experiences (especially in Germany)? Guess I&#039;ll clean my room a bit, just in case.<br /><br />Thanks for your answers.<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t think the Gestapo have either the time or resources to go after someone for buying 10 E&#039;s.<br />1000, maybe they would be interested however. Stuff gets lost in the post from time to time, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				It is very likely it got lost or stolen by the postmen. I have had 2 packets from ebay domestic not coming in. It happens. Quite a lot (2 from 10 packets)

Sometimes the big fishes are not in their focus. They are hunting specifically the recreational drug user who carries 2g weed in his pocket. Maybe to be in their boss&#039; good books and get promoted - dunno.<br /><br /><br />But back to the topic:<br />I tested my own maildrop by sending a empty envelope (from Germany to Germany). It took 1,5 moth to be delivered!! I was pretty surprised about this delivery time. And I still dont know why this took so long. But finally I got my empty envelope delivered. Sometimes the Deutsche Post / DHL is strange.<br />I have had also normal ebay packages which took 1,5-2 weeks - domestic.<br /><br />Greetings abob0803

				Thanks for your answers (more experiences are welcome, of course).<br />I just extended 7 days in the resolution center and hope it&#039;s just the postal service being slow. The longest I ever had to wait was 7 days, but that was years ago... And I never experienced anything getting lost in the mail, so I still think that&#039;s kind of strange. However, these things obviously seem to happen I guess.

				Domestically, I wouldn&#039;t worry, unless the vendor sent you a package rattling to high Hell of tablets, packed in a fractal-coloured envelope. I doubt that German domestic post is scrutinized for drugs at all. Mailman might have long fingers, though.

				Also, even if your packages been intercepted by LE, they can&#039;t fuck you over for it. You should just deny (or better not say a word at all) if LE comes knockin&#039; on your door. (In that case you usually don&#039;t even need a lawyer, if you ain&#039;t got know probation or something else goin on.)<br /><br />After all the letter with the E could have been sent by anybody, just to fuck you over ;-)<br /><br /><br />Keep it positive,<br /><br />MrJohnson1
