				So I ordered a modest order of MDMA from the vendor Goldust.&nbsp; First off let me say it was my first purchase of any sorts on SR and he was readily available to answer any question/concern I had.&nbsp; This lasted about 2-3 days of messaging back and forth (mostly due to the time difference) and finally I decided to pull the trigger.<br /><br />He had warned me that because of my new account he would require FE and explained his refund/reship policies regarding that.&nbsp; I had done my research and felt comfortable doing so, making the purchase official.<br /><br />Well 3 business days later and my prize awaited me when I came home from work.&nbsp; Looks incredible, small crystals (from sand grain to size of a nerd candy), beige/tan color, and that wonderful MDMA smell.&nbsp; Also tastes just like MDMA should.&nbsp; Weight was actually slightly over (nothing crazy but he did throw a bit extra in).<br /><br />I will update this discussion when I try it but I could not be more satisfied with my first SR purchase, thanks Goldust!
