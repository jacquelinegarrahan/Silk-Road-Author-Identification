				Hey Chemcat, <br /><br />Good advice. I just struggled through all this shit a few weeks ago so I didn&#039;t forget, as well as the hundreds of pages of FAQ printouts as reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been busy uninstalling&nbsp; from C:\ and installing new new TBB via new bridges on ironkey usb along with wiping traces of old apps securely with CC cleaner.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a few hours of work but almost finished. Even better than before. <br />&nbsp;

				Great post! Thanks, ChemCat - safety is key. <br />I know a lot of people are unconcerned because they&#039;re buyers not vendors or staff - fact is: If they can&#039;t get staff or vendors, they&#039;d happily nab a buyer to make a point.

				Hi,<br />That&#039;s the way I did it because it said it needed an unsafe application or something to that effect. I shut tor down, opened my other browser, went to torproject and downloaded it that way. I had heard never to open a download in tor. I wish someone with knowledge would answer this question. I&#039;d like to know also, and If I did it correctly<br />Tiger

				Greetings,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as I understand, the dude (his network) that hosts tormail was busted for child porn (good). Unfortunately, that compromised all of tormail. As I understand it, there is now reason to believe that everything in tormail is able to be read by the feds. Anything that was not encrypted is now basically public info for them.&nbsp; Having the latest version of the browser bundle has nothing to do with it. Tormail is a separate entity. That&#039;s the way I understand it. Do not use tormail at all, no logins or anything. If anyone can verify or correct any of this information, please jump in and do so, but I think I am correct.<br />Tiger

				As I&#039;ve learned recently Bitmessage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmessage is a good alternative to tormail. The biggest advantage is that it&#039;s decentralized. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, however.

A good example is PDFs with embedded links. The PDF reader will connect to those links over clearnet. That will happen whenever you open unsafe files, whether you download them over Tor or clearnet. It&#039;s perfectly safe to download the browser bundle over Tor and extract the archive.

				I think it may also be good to under embeddings, Forbid microsoft silverlight, audio/visual, FRAME, and @font-faced.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what these are but I forbid everything just in case. <br /><br />Also under noscript options on the advanced tab and then under the HTTPS tab, I changed it to Always Forbid active web content unless it comes from a secure HTTPS connection instead of Never, this is a good idea right?<br /><br />Also on the Untrusted tab under Advanced noscript options I clicked all the boxes to forbid everything, anybody think this is a good idea or know more about this stuff??<br /><br />Also under options and content I unclicked enable javascript, and also unclicked Load images automatically, and only click load images automatically if i need to see a captcha or something.&nbsp; It seems more secure, although u could re-click the box when wanting to view some SR product images.<br /><br />Any thoughts??

				What if we downloaded a plug in before reading this? Is it possible to go back in and delete it? I haven&#039;t &quot;done&quot; anything so I&#039;m not worried about that, but I&#039;m wondering if I have messed myself up here. Should I throw my laptop in the bonfire and start over? ;)

				Thanks for the heads up. I have been saving my tor bundle to a locked usb, then delete the old bundle and restore it with a new version every time there is a new version, that way there&#039;s nothing on my hard drive. Does that make any sense at all. I&#039;m open to any information to keep myself and the rest of the road safe. Can I make any of these changes to the bundle once it is installed? I&#039;m not a programmer and I never went to M.I.T but I sure like to stay informed.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just as an FYI, the latest version of Firefox (23) no longer offers the option to turn of javascript from the preferences menu. <br /><br />From what I understand, Firefox doesn&#039;t feel it&#039;s necessary to include an option that less than 2% of users find useful, so they removed the functionality... well, that&#039;s not completely true because you can still turn off javascript from the advanced configurations:<br /><br />type about:config in your address bar. Search for javascript.enable and double click that settings so it reads &quot;false&quot;. Now javascript should be disabled. All of you should do this if you installed the latest version of firefox, becuase if you had javascript disabled, downloading the new version enabled it.<br /><br />Peace!

				Checking for updates is crucial, almost as crucial as making sure you have Javascript turned off at every point you can, JS is how they just took down Tormail and the like form what I understand.

MY QUESTION IS THIS. i have been surfing the dark web prior to this. havent bought anything tho. have made a safe net email on here tho. so do i need to start ALLL OVER. making a new email and new SR NAME and NEW SR FORUMS NAME and all of that? Can someone please let me know. I want to be safe as possible here and not put any of the other Tor uses at risk by my mistakes also. Also a side question. i found stolen porn passes but cany watch the videos because flash is blcoked. is it safe to use them on my home ISP??? i mean will they kcik my door for using fake porn passes. They worked to get me into the members area while using TOR. but i was gonna get off tor and log on on SAFARI and watch some porn :) wat do u guys think??? whats the safest way to enjoy my stolen passes???

				Ill sweeten the pot. 1st person to answer how i can browse porn on stolen passes safely can have a BANG BROS PASS. i think thats pretty fair. just dont chnage the password as it will make the account holder suspicious. and he will cancel the account.

				Thanks for the info. I had heard you needed to install in a new folder and when I had tried to update the version did not seem to change. I have also left all configuration as default since there is quite a bit of config you can do. I know Java can been embedded with things so makes sense to disable.

				Thanks ChemCat for the pointers. I was wonder if you (or anyone) could comment on the level of security I am using?<br /><br />Currently I am using an anonymous VPN connecting with OpenVPN, this allows for tunneling through the VPN but also OpenVPN uses AES 256bit keys encrypting the data inside the tunnel. After the VPN is connected then I load the Tor browser which gives me my 2nd hop. I do not have any DNS leaks at all. And of course any communications is mainly done using PGP. <br /><br />Any thoughts? Have I missed anything or could I do something better? Really appreciate any feedback.&nbsp;

				Hello to all,<br />I read this post just now, first of all thanks for the advices ...<br /><br />I have a question, I installed TOR from more or less a month, but only now I took the precautions previously written ..<br /><br />Should I uninstall and reinstall the browser for security? start all over again?

				Thanks ChemCat. Your simple instruction might have just saved hundreds of us from a life behind bars.<br /><br />I read a few pages of responses and did see other people explaining about &quot;the S&quot;, but I figured that I would add another answer to that question.<br /><br />The &quot;S&quot; is the button directly to the left of the URL bar. Alternatively, one can access the options through the Orange TorBrowser button &gt; <br />&gt;click &quot;Add-ons&quot; with the blue puzzle piece<br />&gt;in the new tab that opens click the tab on the left side bar.<br />&gt;No Script is one of the extensions that comes with the bundle (in this case 2.6.7.1), click &quot;options&quot;<br />&gt;This produces the pop-up that ChemCat refers to. click the &quot;embeddings&quot; tab and check the boxes that he told you to.<br /><br /><br />once again great post.

Also...create a new folder to install it in..**DO NOT INSTALL TO THE SAME FOLDER, DO NOT OVERWRITE THE FILES!**&quot;<br /><br />Just wondering what happens if you install a newer version over an old version?

				Thanks so much for the valuable info. I am totally new to all this and am trying to learn how to play it as safe as possible. I guess it probably also wouldn&#039;t hurt to use a different avatar. Curious if anyone knows whether it matters or not using icons that aren&#039;t profile pics? Seems like an unnecessary risk, I plan to change it now.<br /><br />**edit** Just changed my pic to something more generic. But I am still wondering about the risks of using profile pics. Don&#039;t they have software that can recognize images, say, from your Facebook page or something if you use it on a site like this?

				hey gnOssos&nbsp; they can read the metadata on photos taken with phones etc UNLESS you remove it ... there are threads in the security section to help with things like this<br /><br /><br />As for &quot;allowing&quot; scripts ... basically you DONT WANT JAVASCRIPT happening at all ... that said, you wont have access to the emoticons or quick replies if you disable it<br /><br />I tend to &#039;allow&#039; pages as necessary ... and then I &quot;revoke all temporary permissions&quot; to reset everything back to default JS blocking ... NS is possibly one of THE BEST security apps around .... together with Avast AV and I do an Anti-malwarebytes scan once a week, or as required<br /><br />those check boxes designate what functions you can initiate from the NoScript &#039;S&#039; .... if you leave a box unchecked you wont have access to that function from the page&#039;s &quot;S&quot;,&nbsp; you would have to go to options to chang <br />good luck everyone, just be careful and dont rush into anything as it&#039;s worth knowing as much as you can about keeping yourself safe ..

				I ran into some problems updating my browser. I did not delete the previous installation and it gave me issues. It wouldn&#039;t connect to tor then when I got it connected it would not connect to SR, kept saying my proxy settings were messed up.<br /><br />So anyway I deleted everything tor related, which I had to open task manager(in windows ctrl-shift esc) and had to kill a couple of processes in there, vadalia and tor.exe i believe before I could delete it all. Once I had it all deleted I redownloaded it and was able to run it just fine.<br /><br />Just a heads up for anyone who runs into this issue, though if you have the issue you won&#039;t be able to get on here to find out how to find it :-D

				this is definitely a noob question so bare with me here please. the directions on how to set up your torbrowser do not seem to apply to a mac device. so far i have got tor up and running and have disabled java and shockwave flash. is there anything else i can do to make this a little more secure for myself and my device?

				Heya I just wanted to say thanks SR (oh and thanks ChemCat for the info) Ive had some of the best times and the best drugs since I was introduced to the SR community, and I must say I took to it like a duck to water, LOL.<br /><br />I&#039;m finally posting after all this time cause yes all the techie stuff is vital but dont forget to keep an eye on those around you.<br /><br />It was supposed friends, those that I had helped that dobbed me into the cops and actively worked with them to bring me down. <br /><br />Be careful friends.<br /><br />The betrayal of those I let into my life and whose petty issues and nastiness lead the LE to my door and supplied them with the info on where to look.<br /><br />Dirty Narc Dogs, I hope Karma kicks your fucktard teeth in!&nbsp; Oh yeah funny that they stole my information and started up their own little business, cheap artificial crap for top dollar, while making sure I was gonna be away a long time and couldn&#039;t show them up!

				so...there&#039;s a HTTPS Everywhere button on the top left of the window, Can&#039;t you just block all that you listed from there? has a search bar and all apps mentioned except Iframe. Java and Adobe have both been disabled but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s the right way?
