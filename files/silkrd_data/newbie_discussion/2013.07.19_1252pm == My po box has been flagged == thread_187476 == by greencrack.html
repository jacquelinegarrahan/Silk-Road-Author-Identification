				I&#039;m pretty sure my address/po box has been flagged. Don&#039;t ask why, I just know and I&#039;m not going to divulge the reasons. Anyway, that leaves my po box out of the question. And I&#039;m pretty certain my home mailbox is gonna be flagged too simply because of my name. So, any ideas? I don&#039;t know anyone in this town to ask for help getting my mail. I sure wish SR had a courier service. Need some brave young soul to set up courier services all over the US and then we can eliminate the usps. And no, I&#039;m not brave enough nor young any more.

				I believe the ups box would require 2 valid forms of ID. And I still might be recognized unless I drove to another town. Some good ideas though.<br /><br />Courier service could be handled by escrow as well. Nobody gets paid until delivery.

				If your big time, you would get a cheap local apt or house for rent, where packages can be dropped off, in a completely diff name.&nbsp; po box fake id seems to be your best bet in this situation, you may want to pick a shitty post office. Don&#039;t ship too many LB&#039;s too often, small post offices notice too much

				Can poor ppl be trusted not to open my shit?<br /><br />It IS 2 forms of ID. Been there, done that.<br /><br />Can&#039;t afford to move.<br /><br />Should I just chance it?<br /><br />I believe the vendors are using the same, identical &quot;stealth&quot; methods that I won&#039;t go in to detail here. At any rate, it&#039;s a red flag because the PO is photographing everything, and so they&#039;ve intercepted enough to know when you ordered something illicit.

				Perhaps I should become a consultant. I&#039;ve sold legal online before and I can think of 1000&#039;s of ways to ship stealth, at slightly higher cost, but not much. Example, route out a book and place inside. Always ship with an actual product, only hollow. Never use the same return address. Oh well. We&#039;re dealing with drug dealers, not brain surgeons!
