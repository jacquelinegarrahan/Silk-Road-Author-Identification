				Received a package of pills from these guys today. They were nicely vacuum packed, but no other stealth. Not that any was needed, obviously. Pills were unbroken, exactly as described, and genuine. I was a little concerned about the sketchy feedback rating (96%) when I made the order. I usually don&#039;t order that low. None of the complaints were about pills, though, so I bit. No problems at all with this vendor. <br /><br />The length of time from order to arrival was a little long, but I had seen that they were overwhelmed with orders and were doing their best so I gave them my patience and didn&#039;t annoy them with questions about where&#039;s my loot?<br /><br />On my trusted listed.<br /><br />
