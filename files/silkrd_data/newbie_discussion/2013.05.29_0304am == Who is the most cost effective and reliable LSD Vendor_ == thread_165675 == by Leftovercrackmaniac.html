				Yeah, I hear you. I used to get sheets for $100 of killer LSD, but nothing in years. The cost is high but worth it when it&#039;s all you can get.

				I wish I was alive in the 60&#039;s n shit man, sunshine acid for a dollar a hit. This homeless dude I met in jail once told me how he used to get a hit of the sunshine acid back in the day for a buck and then cut it into fourths wit a razor blade and him and 3 friends would trip balls all day off just that. Man nothing like that exists anymore =( 25I is almost that cheap, but it tastes like asshole&#039;s and is nowhere near the good Lucy, no matter what the fuck people say

				I agree bro, Everything on the street went from like 5 a hit to fuckin 15 and it blows. Ever since that bust in Kansas a while back the lsd just went to absolute shit all over the US. Plus kids gettin acid on the street are tellin me shit like &quot;yea man this guy I know has great shit dude, It&#039;s like 15 a hit and makes you see badass trails&quot;. I&#039;m like dude, That&#039;s either really shitty acid or you&#039;re getting gipped yo! I&#039;m trying to tell these kids that the shit I used to drop would allow me to hold a fuckin conversation with a roll of toilet paper for hours hahahahaha. Or this one time dude I dropped some lucy and there was this clock in my room that was a lizard playin a banjo and I shit you not yo, This think melted into a million tiny lizards with banjos and they all came crawling towards me hahahaha. Wtf happened to that shit!?!?!

				Leftovercrackmaniac, when you find shit like that again PLEASE let me know! lol last time i took 4 hits of some ok shit, I couldnt form sentences at all, and felt like a damn retard but I didnt have no visuals like that, just tracers and crazy colors and everythin spinning around alot. I do know where your coming from but I have not had an experience like that before and I really want too, guess I really do need to take like a whole ten strip or more next time I get some shit, I thought it sounded crazy but maybe its necessary to get the FULL experience =p

				Woah, that sounds crazy awesome. Here I am paying $10 for some stuff that only makes me feel a little silly and maybe slight visuals haha. At least NBOMe is hella cheap. That Kansas bust you&#039;re talking about, was it the one Krystle Cole aka the Nero Soup girl was involved in? I don&#039;t really believe what that homeless man supposedly said but its not like I have any proof, obviously. Finally, can somebody please accurately define &quot;sunshine&quot; in context of acid for me?

				Dude he knew what he was talkin bout for sure man, and from my understanding Sunshine acid had a certain print on it(dont remember what I have heard) and was the bomb back in the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s, How can you not believe that? were you alive back then? I am pretty sure you can fit enough LSD material on one little square of paper to make 10 people trip if you wanted soo...

				I ordered 12 hits last week from Clearance and I did not think it was a waste of money. But it was not as strong as the last time I remember tripping. Great visuals, but at no point did I lose control of my mind. Back in the day I sold gel tabs to this guy who ended up going to the ER because he thought he lost his legs...no shit!&nbsp; I want to feel like that again and I don&#039;t mind paying for it.

I&#039;ve been using SR and reading the forums for a long time so I know a lot of the ins and outs but have never really posted here until recently. I suppose it&#039;s not too bad being stuck in the newbies section because I&#039; don&#039;t mind helping out the new people. <br /><br />If we all get good products from the good sellers it helps everyone as the honest sellers make more money, customers are happier and if a seller is making a lot of money honestly then there is no point in them trying to scam people. If that&#039;s not a good reason to be helping people then I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />I&#039;ll +1 you right back after my 100th post.

				Lol, not &quot;just a print&quot; but from what I heard they were known by their print. I was not alive back then either, but I have heard more than one story about the famous sunshine shit from some old heads. And if someone decided to just puts some other random shit on the same print you dont think people would notice? Idk maybe its cause motherfuckers half the time have no clue what the fuck their taking nowadays, but If you know your shit, you know your shit brah. Idk, I am just surprised you have never even heard of it, let alone skeptical about it, lol I wish an old head would hop on here and tell us what the fuck is up.

No, I&#039;m saying once it was established that this Sunshine was the best of the best, people could have started putting random shit on blotters with the same print and saying it was the real Sunshine. Of course, after consumption, the experienced users would know it wasn&#039;t. I haven&#039;t been in the acid scene for long enough, obviously&nbsp; ;) haha. I was mostly saying I&#039;m skeptical about the guy who got a tab for $1, divided it into 4 and tripped with three other friends all day.

				Yes I see, I am not skeptical as you could probably still order LSD out of the backs of magazines and shit back then, It is not hard to believe 1 hit could make 4 people trip, but I guess since in the 2000&#039;s people even skimp to almost near thresh-hold doses on their tabs, it would be hard for someone to imagine.

				Believe the stories about the 60&#039;s and early 70&#039;s. Having grown up in the era I gotta tell you we got some of the best ever. The funny thing is that there wasn&#039;t that much blotter. Most everything came in a pill&nbsp; Orange Barrels, White and Purple Microdots and occasionally windowpane gelatin.&nbsp; The stuff was cheap, like getting Orange Barrels for $100-$125 per hundred. You would give them away because you knew at the next party someone would turn you on if you wanted. It was strong also. We didn&#039;t talk mic&#039;s back then it was a hit or a 4 way hit. I would imagine most was 250 mic and up.&nbsp; Remember going to see King Crimson and a guy was selling LSD on the street. A friend and I each bought one, as I popped mine in my mouth the guy said to my friend &quot;only eat a quarter&quot;. One of the best rides ever&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Peace
