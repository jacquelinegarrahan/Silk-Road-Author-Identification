				I actually wanted to post a reply to this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159840.0<br /><br />... but couldn&#039;t do that because I&#039;m just a lowly noob.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I just recently became aware of those new prepaid envelopes being offerred by USPS, and they seem like a great innovation.&nbsp; I expect that a resale market in them will spring up soon, with people offering to sell bundles of them on Craigslist for cash, and some of the people who buy them on Craigslist might even offer them for sale on SR, much like you can already purchase flat-rate postage stamps.&nbsp; Since they are traceable however, it would probably be a good idea if parties selling them on SR were not also involved in any illegal commerce, unless they are very confident in the anonymity of the RL transaction in which the envelopes were obtained.

				Those are free. All you have to do is walk into a post office and grab as many as you want. No resale market.

				ooo. Ya those might be different. If you are really interested in sending packages you can make a usps account anonymously and print out the postage. Making it look more legit as well. Then you can drop it into the blue boxes without worrying about being over the 13oz weight limit if you just throw regular stamps on.&nbsp; But, that is going to take some intensive search and money. I know how to do it, but, I paid for that info.
