				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Since I am new, I cannot post in the other areas that are dedicated to this kind of question, so any assistance from the community would be great! <br /><br />I am seriously considering becoming a seller here, but I want to be thoughtful and informed before I move forward. I am hesitant to lay out the $500 bond before getting a feel as to whether or not what I have will sell well enough to make it worth it (and over a couple of months, not years).<br /><br />I have a steady supply of Oxycontin 10mg (OP) by Purdue Pharm. as well as Morphine Sulfate 30mg ER tabs. I am in the US. <br />I may be able to get hold of another opiate as well if I ask for it.&nbsp; If so, what sells well?<br /><br />Do 10mg tabs even sell? Is there something that people want more than that?<br /><br />Thank you for your comments and thoughts on this.<br /><br />Peace

				If you sell your OPs at a good price, that is $3-$5 a pill, you could sell well because all the oxy on here is really overpriced. What would be best would be fair priced roxis, like $8-$15 for a 30mg. If your prices are the same as the other vendors it wouldn&#039;t bring you a lot of sales..

				Only you can decide the &quot;worth&quot;. Would you be able to sell products? Sure, if you price them right. How much money you will make all depends on your margins and inventory availability. Thinking your going to make huge amounts of money with 2 products is probably not realistic. OP&#039;s are not very popular. MS-Contin is not very popular either. They are both time released tabs. You would probably have much more success with instant release tabs.
