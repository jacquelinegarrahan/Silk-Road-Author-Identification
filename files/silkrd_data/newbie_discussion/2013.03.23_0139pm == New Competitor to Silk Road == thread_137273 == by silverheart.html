				Hi all,<br /><br />Come and join us on Atlantis, the latest free marketplace.<br /><br />We are offering 3 months of free commission and free vendor accounts to members of either Silk Road or Black Market Reloaded if you have a vendor account with feedback indicating that you&#039;re a legitimate high quality seller.<br /><br />There&#039;s a slight difference to this market, we deal exclusively in Litecoin. Litecoins are just as easy to obtain as Bitcoin, you can read more about them in our guides, on our website, or your trusty Google search engine. A very popular Litecoin exchange is https://btc-e.com -- they deal in Litecoin, Bitcoin, and a few others. Litecoin has shown EXTREMELY promising stability and growth over the past two years. Adopting it now will be similar to the Bitcoin boom as far as returns are concerned.<br /><br />Take up the opportunity now to get your free vendor account as this offer won&#039;t last and is only available whilst we&#039;re still growing. We&#039;ve been live for 1 week and already have over 1000 new users. If you wish to claim the vendor account message support on the website, or drop in on the Atlantis forum and ask there.<br /><br />[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion

				heh...<br /><br />was wondering when some new blood was going to step up for a shot at the title...<br /><br />If I&#039;m honest though the litecoin thing is annoying... seems to be a gimmick or worse an attempt to wind back time and jump on the wagon but before it got so far along.. I mean I get there must be a financial advantage toy whoever is running that show but unless its as easy as BTC and , for me anyway, doesn&#039;t run the risk of undermining BTC I will not be using your market . It worries me that these wanna be coins could be the undoing of the system by over complicating things and turning people off from coming on board..<br /><br />Competition is a good thing and innovation is key to advancing but simply making a new, but almoist identical, coin is not either of these things.<br /><br />SR will always be my first and the one that shiwed me the way so I will always give support to Pirate and the crew but I look forward to seeing what impact you will have on everything.. The media having another market to report on has to be a good thing though so maybe the masses will drift over that way and take the issues with them! <br /><br />;-D

				I bought some LTC on https://btc-e.com - $40 worth, and I got about $200 out of that when the price increased over a period of one month. Wanted to buy more but cash flow was bad, and I was heavily invested in my orders.<br /><br />Personally I think that LTC has a long way to go before it reaches a stable maximum price.

Not only will sellers be earning their regular USD amounts, but they have the potential to sit on it and multiply their earnings tenfold. <br /><br />We take feedback very seriously and we have an entire team dedicated to development. All of the great ideas that we have been presented with will be implemented. We just launched a few new options in the Atlantis Accounts section earlier today as an example!<br /><br />We&#039;ve noticed there is a tendency for other markets to take a back seat to user requests however we believe our sellers are very important and wish to keep them happy. The feature suggestion was great, and we&#039;re excited to get it deployed to see how efficiently it changes the dynamic of successful transactions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137273.msg930857#msg930857">Quote from: Taklamak4n on March 23, 2013, 03:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since Litecoin is a copy of Bitcoin, it is every bit as prone to high volatility as Bitcoin. I hope somebody comes up with a stable cryptocurrency. It could be achieved by pegging the currency to EUR or USD. Another alternative would be to increase the number of coins in circulation e.g. 2% annually. Anyway, Bitcoin with its boom/bust stuff is not good for commerce.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We hedge the price to the USD. This means that market volatility does not affect the sellers, and they are always paid the same amount regardless. This makes it safe to deal with any potential volatility in the currency market.<br />

				Thanks for this folks!<br />I don&#039;t see SR and Atlantis as head to head competitors, they are complementary, more choice is better for consumers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve poked around the site, and it is nicely responsive, looks great, and I like the features. I wish you success.<br /><br />I do have a questions though:<br />Does Atlantis use a tumbler to obfuscate transactions the same way that SR does?

				Why not use Bitcoins? Having two separate markets using the same currency could help the currency stabilize. Switching to LTC seems a bit petty, but I am very interested in hearing the reasoning behind this.

What I like about litecoin over bitcoin is that the transactions happen so fast. Virtually instant.<br /><br />Otherwise, I don&#039;t know, product differentiation? There are plenty of markets that use bitcoin. Using litecoin makes them different to the others.

				I&#039;m going to become a vendor here but it would be interesting to also try other sites as well. I would agree with the above posters, things like built in tumblers would be nice (but not necessary), though without a &#039;litecoin mixer&#039; like bitcoinfog i see this as incredibly risky situation.

Having two parallel currencies would divide the user base, and could be quite risky. As long as people keep using the bitcoin to buy and sell goods to the extent they are now, then it shouldn&#039;t crash to apocalyptic lows, LTC could disrupt this.<br /><br />But then again, I am open to new ideas :) I just need sound reasoning and a personal incentive to adopt them. As it stands I am going to be cautious. It is important to not invest to much power into any single entity, since power always corrupts. DPR is like anon, he could be anybody, or many. For all I know half of the users of Silk Road could be DPR, or maybe he is an AI. I am going way off-topic. I&#039;ll just stop.<br /><br />What I mean to say is that it is important to challenge power :)

				&gt;Is litecoin&nbsp; pretty much just printing more money like the governments do?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t looked into it too much yet, but it looks like the same model as bitcoin. The gold standard is a better analogy than fiat currency (&#039;printing more money&#039;). Hence the &#039;mining&#039; analogy used to represent the work done to create the coins. The money supply is constrained by some sort of physical limits, and until there&#039;s bitcoin/litecoin banks, you won&#039;t get the sort of organic credit creation that happens with fiat currencies.<br /><br />That said: that&#039;s mostly based on my understanding of bitcoin.

				How is litecoin a competitor to Silk Road? It is not even a competitor to Bitcoin at the moment, Litecoin is only really open for early investors at the moment. If something were to happen to Bitcoin such as a massive down spike would Litecoin become a little more prevelant.

				Well, and obviously I&#039;m rambling because I&#039;d like to hit 50 posts at some point, it&#039;d seem to me that the real value of litecoin would have to come from a working market. <br /><br />To me, bitcoin was a novelty until I got my shit together to find SR and I needed some to score some gear.&nbsp; Even now I don&#039;t plan to hold bitcoins - I use govt-issued currency to get bitcoins, to get the various SR offerings. Over the last few weeks, obviously, I&#039;ve scored some nice discounts on gear because of value fluctuations, but I&#039;m still not buying BTC as an investment.<br /><br />&nbsp;A decade or two ago, USD was the pre-eminent currency in the world - today I use it like bitcoin: buy it if I need to pass it on, but never hold.<br /><br />So, basically I dunno. Litecoin might be flash-in-the-pan, but simply dismissing it is the same as going short, isn&#039;t it?&nbsp; Its value, just like BTC or USD, will be based on its use. So does anyone have the address of this other market? Did I miss it in this thread?<br /><br />If you can&#039;t eat it, then I reckon everything is a market, and it all comes down to the greed:fear ratio. We all make an assessment, even if we think we don&#039;t.<br /><br />Ramble over - I need to mix another drink. So in summary: if someone will send me weed for these litecoin things, then that&#039;s when I&#039;ll be interested in having some.&nbsp; 8)<br />

				It&#039;s always good to see competition, but my initial reaction to Atlantis is negative.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; First, your PIN is only a 4 digit number.&nbsp; Relatively easy to brute-force.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; There is no email associated with your account and the only way to reset your password is using that trivial to hack PIN.&nbsp; So your password might as well be a four digit number too. (I know this because of their pathetic registration form: it allows you to input a password longer than 20 characters but will only record the first 20 characters without telling you)&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t keep more than $20 in here for more than a day.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The categories are copied from SR.&nbsp; That&#039;s totally retarded, because if there is one place that needs improvement on SR, it&#039;s in categorization.&nbsp; Come on you Atlantis fucks, innovate.&nbsp; Do some fucking work.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The site is fast.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; It looks nice.<br /><br />I would love competition, but this isn&#039;t it–at least not today.&nbsp; This is just a carbon-copy of SR.&nbsp; If a little work is put into the project it could be successful.&nbsp; It has potential.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				Competition (i.e. another seller site) is good for the market, but I can&#039;t see the point of creating another currency. It&#039;s just reinventing the wheel. The idea of investing in them early before they rise in value isn&#039;t a sustainable source of income. It&#039;s not a good enough reason to move away from the tried and tested currency. From what I can see it doesn&#039;t offer anything to make it better than BTC in the long term after they&#039;ve risen in value too.
