				Hey guys. I finally overcame my paranoia and bought some bitcoins, which im still waiting on to be transferred from seller.<br /><br />And Ive decided to stop drooling over the very nice looking stuff with awesome reviews and buy something already (domestic for now)<br /><br />My question is: Have you guys ever been cheated in some way even from good vendors? Like what happens usually with street dealers?<br /><br /><br />Im glad to finally be officially part of this growing anonymous family and I hope I will see you guys around here forever!

				Hi there,<br /><br />Welcome to SR, and yes drooling over all the shiny stuff makes you want to jump right in and buy&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I would start small, you don&#039;t say what you want to buy but advice is the same regardless.&nbsp; So no need to say.<br /><br />Find a vendor with good feedback.&nbsp; You should especially look at the most recent feedback, so click the vendors name and go to his main page.&nbsp; Look out for lot&#039;s of ppl saying &quot;FE&quot; or even worse feedback saying it took too long to arrive etc...<br />when you find one, with a product you want, check out the feedback for it.&nbsp; Some vendors have too many listings and don&#039;t have everything in stock...&nbsp; so your order could be delayed :(<br /><br />Check that the vendor does not want you to FE (finalize early).&nbsp; if they do then find another one.&nbsp; If you FE then you are on your own, and you don&#039;t need that for your first buy.<br /><br />never spend more than you can afford to lose. EVER :) <br />Start small and see how it works.<br /><br />As long as you never spend anything you cannot afford to lose, and use vendors with a high rep and feedback that makes you comfortable, then you will be fine.&nbsp; Also staying domestic is the way to go.&nbsp; <br /><br />take the plunge dude...

I waited 11 days before my package came, and his estimated time was between 3-10 days.

				While every seller has the potential to do this, the good sellers are the ones that make it right.
