				Hello, I&#039;m brand new to using SR. I&#039;m simply making this post hoping that another member can reassure a noob like me that I&#039;m doing things right.<br />My first purchase I was looking to make was buying two hits of LSD off a vendor on here. (Tessellated i believe) <br />Since I&#039;ve never done this, I messaged him on the main SR website using a message encrypted in PGP. The message was basically to inquire about the purchase, and what I should do when ordering it to be safe. I also included my public key. Is that the correct thing to do?<br />My final thing is to ask if anyone has any tips for me. For example, the best way to order off here and not have the feds come knocking on my front door. How to not get scammed, etc.<br />Thank you for your time.<br />-wzrd

				I have a lot of the same questions, as I am also new to the road. Particularly regarding the procedure involved in making a purchase. Is there an faq someone can point me to besides the one on the sr main site?

				Welcome to The Road!<br /><br />I have been lurking down here for the better part of a year, and have made many successful transactions. I was scammed once, but it was my own fault for not doing my research. <br /><br />devinwzrd:<br />Yes, that was very well done. It is a good procedure to include your PGP key when engaging in sensitive discussions with a vendor. <br /><br />Making a purchase is quite similar to making a purchase on a clearnet site like Amazon. Add the product to your cart, select your shipping method, and click update cart to make sure everything is properly accounted for. Then, encrypt your address and paste it into the address field. Enter your pin and you are good to go!<br /><br />Some general tips:<br /><br />NEVER FINALIZE EARLY (FE).<br />This is perhaps the most important. There are some exceptions to this, such as vendors who require buyers with certain stats or locations to FE, but you can boost your stats with some easy digital goods purchases. Shroomeister has a very interesting compiliation of infographics, and PurpleLotus has his INCREDIBLE coupon packs to name a few. <br /><br />ALWAYS DO RESEARCH ON THE VENDOR.<br />Do not just rely on feedback to inform you about a vendor, search them on the forums and look for solid reviews by full members of the community. The only time I was ever scammed was the time I did not do my research. I only lost 70 dollars, but that is 70 dollars I could have used somewhere else. <br /><br />There are several great resources for vendor research. I would have to say that perhaps the most well constructed would the LSD Avengers, found here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br />Most of the drugs available on SR have their own vendor review threads, just do a search. Most vendors will also have review threads, but there are a few that do not, mostly new ones that are just recently starting out. Generally though, as long as you stay in escrow you are protected from scams, as you will usually be able to recover most if not all of your money if things go bad. <br /><br />RECEIVING ORDERS.<br />I do NOT recommend starting out with a massive order. Ideally, you want the address the items are being received at to be different from the address you store them at. Really though, the top vendors on here have little to no problems with their stealth shipping. It also depends a lot on your comfort level. Personally, I find that receiving an oz of weed to be a lot less nerve wracking than the idea of getting a full pound. But if you are trying to avoid getting caught as much as possible and just going for personal use, keep it small and you will be fine. Also, depending on how things are done where you live there will be variations. What works in my area might not necessarily work for you. For example, if we both live in apartment complexes, mine might just toss it at me while yours might invite the cops to use their mail room as an exercise room for their dogs. Know the policies of your area!<br /><br />If anyone has any specific questions, feel free to PM me and I will do my best to answer them or direct you to someone who can. Unless you plan on discussing potentially compromising info, there is not really much of a need to encrypt everything, but if you want to simply message me your public key and I will send you mine. <br /><br />Good luck to all of you, and welcome once again to The Road!
