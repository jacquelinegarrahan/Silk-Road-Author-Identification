				so im on sheep and i can help but think this site looks like an exact replica of Silk Road <br />only with better graphics almost like a dubbed down upgrade or something<br /><br />do you think its just a giant sting operation<br />or does this thing have the potential to become bigger than sr was <br />with all the given press and stuff<br />curious on what you guys think

				I personally think its got great Potential.. I would much rather use SHEEPS than BMR just cause of how user friendly it is.. BMR is good enough but how fucking hard is it to write a code and do everything needed to make it look like sheeps//<br /><br />Iv already met 2 vendors on sheeps. one is from here under a diff name, another is a ORIGINAL OC80MG VENDOR.. AND THE DUDE IS soo fucking cool, just to&nbsp; show me he has good original oc just made by a diff brand, he has sent me one... fully free.. so if indeed it is, i will be buying from him off and on<br /><br />then the BTH AND CHYNA WHITE vendor that was on here has been able to LOWER his prices almost half , he was a top rated reliable vendor..<br /><br /><br />So PGP IS A MUST AND IM ONLY WILLING TO WORK WITHVENDORS I DID ON SR,, WHICH I BOUGHT FROM EVERY VENDOR ON HERE THAT SOLD H, OR THEY HEARD OF ME AND I HEARD OF THEM.. SO NON OF THAT FE BS , NEVER DID IT HEAR WONT DO IT THERE,,FUCK IT ALLIF IT COMES TO THAT<br /><br /><br />SORRYFOR THE CAPS EVERYONE MY CAPS BUTTON GETS STUCK, SORRY
