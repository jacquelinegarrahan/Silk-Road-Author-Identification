				hi there<br /><br />top newbie here.<br /><br />i ordered a small amount&nbsp; of something from a top vendor in NL, shipped to UK<br />i FE as requested coz of my noob stats<br />hasnt arrived after 2 weeks, (long time, right?)<br />afetr a bit of com between me and vendor, he suggested a refund. <br />a bit dissapointed, i agreed, not wanting the risk of a reship if my 1st shipment got intecrcepted.<br /><br />now what are the odds of the 1st shipment is caught between those 2 countries?&nbsp; it looks like the vendor ships abroad very easily , so thought it d b quite safe.<br />the refund was 50 %, i should have asked first i guess, thinking it was 100%, since i didnt ask for a reship.<br />feel slightly cheated. no big deal, but kinda annoying.<br />should i consider buying domesctically until i get my stats above the 10 transactions mark?<br />what are the odds a noob buyer getting screwed for his first buy by a top seller(not pointing finger, just thinking its a possibility)<br /><br />thanx for your time.<br /><br /><br />

				definitely a mixup, no way a top seller would want to risk a 1/5 feedback in order to rip off a n00b for a small amount. it may well arrive sometime in the next week or two, genuine postal delays happen quite often!<br /><br />just hope they&#039;ve stealthed it sufficiently to stay safe in the post that long!

				I can only say from my experiences with DGC (a formerly good mail order provider)<br /><br />The dutch post can be pretty hit and miss, sometimes I had packages within 2 days of dispatch, sometimes up to 2-3 weeks later. Twice, I got the letter, stripped of contents (could have been dutch post or royal mail that did that).<br /><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t sound like you got scammed, especially if the seller is talking refunds. <br /><br /><br />I am aiming to only get stuff within my own country, most checking on stuff is based on stuff coming into the country.
