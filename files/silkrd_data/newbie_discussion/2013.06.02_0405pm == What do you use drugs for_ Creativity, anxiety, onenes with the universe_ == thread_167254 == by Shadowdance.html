				Hey, some of us are american&#039;s and can&#039;t afford health care&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Just wondering what is used for what? I ask because it&#039;s very hard to get the results you are looking for through search engines, all you get is blahblah abuse blah blah.<br /><br />I just read that shrooms have been shown to treat/cure depression and I thought that was pretty awesome. Of course all studies to research this have been blocked by the uk government. <br /><br />

				There are trials running in Manchester at the moment seeing if ketamine, administered before electroshock therapy, could help bipolar sufferers. I was considering applying but I&#039;m out of the catchment zone. Not sure I have the balls for ect anyway. Although having an electrically induced seizure whilst in the k hole would certainly be something to tell your grand kids about.

				^^ I tried to do a case study but was rejected because of my anxiety with needles (to do blood work) coupled with my (apparently) incredibly tiny veins. It would take multiple sticks to get any blood and since it&#039;s a study they&#039;d want to take blood frequently.<br /><br />

				I take my rX pain meds for chronic pain, and dabble in other stuff mostly for fun. Valium or weed to help me unwind and get some sleep. MDMA once in a while for some memorable intimate times with my lady. Shrooms when I&#039;m out camping to become one with nature. Occasionally a session on the hard pipe for some real excitement and paranoia ;)

				in all honesty, its pretty much just sheer entertainment/recreational value.&nbsp; typically i&#039;m already going to have a fantastic time and there is no better way to kick it up a notch like weed, alcohol, xtc, lsd, adderalls lol, whatever it is in in moderation.&nbsp; For as many types of drugs i do I very seldomnly go harder than weed/alcohol.&nbsp; All the others happen like twice a year, but with SR that might change lol.&nbsp; Any life changing experiences from lsd or whatever came just by accident, i was in a good spot in my life, learning about zen buddhism whatever, and it just further enhanced my understanding.

				I use psychedelics because I believe it teaches me about myself and how I can be a better person. Yeah I like to see some cool shit visual wise, but there is always something to learn when taking psychedelics. Since I started using them I have had family members tell me I seem happier. They have helped me overcome depression due to death in the family. <br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke weed anymore because I get drug tested at work, but I smoked weed because I enjoyed it. Not much else I can say about it. It made everything more fun and more entertaining to me. <br /><br />I use alcohol because it is a big part of where I live and I usually have a great time when I use alcohol in moderation, just like any other drug.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				I use xanax to help with panic attacks or to forget about traumatizing memory and to comedown from the coke.<br />I use the coke because it picks me up when l feel depressed and makes me more confident/ sociable; basically it makes me feel good.<br />I use opiates and such because they make me mellow and heavy and helps me feel like everything&#039;s going to be alright.<br />Sometimes I&#039;ll take a shroom before watching a mindfuck movie, but last time I watched Mullholland dr and looper and my head exploded in an unpleasant, scary way.<br />Basically I just self medicate for depression because I would rather spend money on drugs than put my parents through a suicide or pain them with of my problems. It would break their hearts and mine to see them so upset.

				Self-medicating ... main reason for my usage.<br /><br />Secondary, I use drugs because life has become a beast of burden and unnatural. I think if I lived a different time, I would be better off (even if I die at 30 or 40) because a shorter life span with less pressure to be a cog in the machine is a better experience than living to 100.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

				Alcohol to feel good and have a good time.<br />My first high on weed taught me some amazing things, but I strongly dislike smoking now...it just makes me paranoid and hyperaware of everything.<br />Experimenting with psychedelics to explore my mind and to get a change of perspective. The euphoria is fun too ^_^

				Coffee to get out of bed.<br />Cannabis to enjoy myself occasionally when i&#039;m alone (watching movies, playing videogames, etc.)<br />Cocaine to be able to enjoy social interactions when i go out.<br />Ketamine to go along with my cocaine when i do some with friends or when i have sex. (Apparently it has antidepressant virtues even if you just take it once in a while)<br />Very rarely, some Speed to play videogames for hours with a friend of mine.<br />Xanax to take the edge off after a night of doing cocaine/speed.<br />Psychedelics when i want to go out in the wild and trip with friends or stay alone and meditate.<br />

				I know they are trialing Ketamine for treating major depression. Apparently sufferers are cured instantly for weeks after one dose.<br />I take drugs for all the reasons you mention but most of all just because I can and enjoy it. Live once experience what you can.
