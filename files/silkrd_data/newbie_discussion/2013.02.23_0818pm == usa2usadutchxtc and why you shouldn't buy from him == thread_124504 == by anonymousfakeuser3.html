				Wanted to place this in the rumor mill but apparently I can&#039;t. (It&#039;s ok to make purchases but you can&#039;t leave feedback appropriately until you waste 50 posts on the forum...)<br /><br />I placed an order on 2/11 through usa2usadutchxtc. Waited for 4 days until I received a message &quot;we don&#039;t have what we placed for sale but we can send something else that is similar?&quot; I responded saying &#039;I want what I ordered and paid for but if all you have is the replacement, that&#039;s fine&quot; 3 days later it finally changed to &#039;in transit&#039;. Two days after the order supposedly being in transit, my order was cancelled without any explanation. I e-mailed asking why the long wait and why the cancellation, after three days they still haven&#039;t responded to my messages. This is unprofessional, wasted my time and who knows how many other customers have been put through this BS.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like to leave bad reviews. All of my other purchases have gone through without any issues and I&#039;m slowly gaining positive purchases but this vendor is acting shady and I wouldn&#039;t want anyone else waiting for weeks at a time just to be cancelled without any explanation.<br /><br />

				Oh now, don&#039;t you say such a thing.&nbsp; Leaving the truth about any vendor here and what they do is the only way we can ascertain whom to trust.<br /><br />SPILL THE BEANS, people, if you get screwed around by any single vendor here.&nbsp; Make no mistake: if we do not stand up and support the good ones and destroy the bad, we all lose.

				oh my good lord that i dont believe in anyways.....we did not scam you. we have never scammed anyone. every siingle person who has ever claimed not getting packs was fully refunded or their order canclled. one guy was refunded extra cause we felt bad, one person got a free re ship with 2 xtc tablets for free even though tracking showed it was delivered because he said someone stole 10g mdma from his drop so we felt bad. no1 here has ever scammed. the last week or so our shipping times were slowed and put on hold, packs took about 1 week business days really 5-7 business days to arrive but they did arrive and in a safe manner. the facts remian we have great stealth and prices and product is fantastic. we answer almost all pm&#039;s quickly and we are fair to everyone in a financial sense. <br /><br />so buy some newly listed dilaudid that are some of the cheapest on the road and see for yourself.

For either of these reasons I will never be ordering from you again. Refund?! YEAH I&#039;ll take one! I lost so much money waiting for my order and that doesn&#039;t include the stress of a domestic order going missing for 12 days! I could have gone with a competitor I personally messaged you beforehand addressed exactly my concerns and arranged with you to have my product delivered by a set day (easter) and you FAILED. If you would have ATLEAST taken the time to answer my concerns maybe I wouldn&#039;t think you were a self serving douchebag. I can&#039;t believe that you act like it has nothing to do with you and brush all of this off as no big deal. Accept that you fucked up its really not that hard people respect it much more than making up excuses and offering bullshit refunds.&nbsp; &nbsp;
