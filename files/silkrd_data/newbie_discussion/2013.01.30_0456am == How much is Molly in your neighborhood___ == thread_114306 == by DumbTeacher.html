				In Chicago a user quantity of MDMA is 0.12g or 120mg, whichever you prefer. The going rate is $10-15 bucks. What is the price in your neck of the woods?

				Do people actually cut mdma and if so how and, more importantly, WHY???<br /><br />I know that it can be cut with a number of things, inositol, caffeine, speed, etc, etc, etc.... But just because you can doesn&#039;t mean you should.

				£30 for 0.7 of crystal, Quality varies<br /><br />if its crystal it cant be cut but the process of making the MDMA can be done better and only a skilled chemist can create MDMA of respectful purity. If it it a color such as purple then it usually means it has imperfections from when it was created<br /><br />if its powder then ye it can be cud and most probably has!

				Hahahahahahaaaa!!!! I love you Connoiseur!!!<br /><br />But I am only paying $45 (currently. Although I am just starting to get into the mdma market) for a gram of GOOD MOLLY. I sell them for $60. Hell of a turn around. If a person is selling 120mg for $15-$20 then they make DOUBLE what they pay easily without any cut whatsoever. Hell, if they charge $20 for the 120 mg they make $160 off of one gram. In the competitive market that I am in that is a damned good return for $60. That&#039;s a damned good return on $100 also. <br />If they cut it, of course it increases the profit for that one gram but it slows down the turnover. Thus slowing down the profit. That is why I ask the question of why cut it. But everyone is entitled to their opinion.

				Two yearss ago near northern PA, good crystal MDMA was available to me (I am older with few connections) for $80 per gram.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never had anything as good yet, but I wonder if it was because I was a virgin to really good pure MDMA, and I&#039;m chasing the dragon in respect to novelty and the powerful nature of the &quot;first 5 or 10 times&quot; with MDMA....I had done the drug probably ten times before over the previous ten years in weak pills orally, but boy was it ever a special summer for us that rolled out on that great crystal, it was clear and crystalline, very few colored impurities.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping I can someday again come close to finding that experience again on the Road here, but some say it will never happen.
