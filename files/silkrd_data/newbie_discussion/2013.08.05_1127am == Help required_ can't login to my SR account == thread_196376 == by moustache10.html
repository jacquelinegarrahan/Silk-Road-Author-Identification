				Hi all. First time poster but been using SR for 6 months or so. For the last couple of days I haven&#039;t been able to log in to the site. The Login screen appears as normal but when I click go it just refreshes as if I&#039;ve entered my details wrong. Any advice as to why this might be? It crossed my mind that the site could be on something of a lock down after the current security scare? Or is this just something that happens occasionally and I&#039;ll be able to get back on in another few days?<br />Thanks.

				A few things you should try. Close TOR and reopen it. See if you can log in. <br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work restart you computer and try again.<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work try to create a new account and check if that works.. <br /><br />If even that doesn&#039;t get you at least logged in, just wait a while and try again in a few hours..<br /><br />If the new account does work, contact customer support and ask what is wrong with your original account.

				Thanks very much for the advice. Restarted my computer and Tor but still can&#039;t seem to log on OR create a new account, just keeps on refreshing back to the login screen. I&#039;ll try again this evening and see if it&#039;s just a temporary blip.

				Hi- thanks very much for taking the time to give me a bit of help! If anyone is in the same situation: I ended up sorting out the problem by downloading the new Tor Browser bundle. Suddenly I could log in again no problem. Thanks again!
