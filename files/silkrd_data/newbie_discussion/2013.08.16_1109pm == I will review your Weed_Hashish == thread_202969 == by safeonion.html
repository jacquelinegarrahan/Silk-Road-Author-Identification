				Greetings SR.<br /><br />I have 10 years of cannabis experience, and that&#039;s why if you want an review of your weed, from a different perspective i will do that.<br />I will give a full &quot;report&quot; of my personal view of the specific string/weed/hashish.<br />The review will look probably look like this.<br /><br />Silver Haze Review<br /><br />Reviewed By: safeonion<br />Reviewd On: 17-08-2013<br />Got it by: You xxxx<br /><br />Name: Silver Haze<br />Grade: A-<br />Type: Sativa<br /><br />Great strain for morning and daytime smoke. Did not cause me to suffocate on my couch. Awesome high with a great look, taste, and smell to match. This is definitely a strain that I smoke again.<br /><br />Looks:<br />Great looking bud. On the lighter side of green covered with red hairs and nice trycomes that come off on your fingers when handling. Nugs are nice and dense and have a nice little lump sounds when letting it drop from a little distance.<br /><br />Smell:<br />Due to the indica it is a little on piney side. However, the predominate smell is a sweet fruity flavor. Almost reminded me of a fruity pebbles or fruit loops. The smoke also has a nice little smell after burnt.<br /><br />Taste:<br />The taste is great as it matches the fruity smell. Kinda made my tongue tingle a little on the exhale.<br /><br />Buzz Type/Length:<br />I could tell instantly when i got the product that this would be one of my favorites based on view alone. The buzz/high matched the expectations the looks created. Gave me a nice stoney high, where I was still able to function and get a little homework done. As I mentioned early, it also induced a nice little cough. The intense high it provided lasted for about thirty minutes, and the overall buzz prolonged for about two hours. At this point I was starving and began to eat my high away!

				I&#039;m happy to receive free samples as well and I&#039;ve been at it for 40 years, not none stop of course, there was the great drought of &#039;99 and the time I spent working my passage on the southern seas :)
