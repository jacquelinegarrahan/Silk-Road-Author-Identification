				Yes. If it&#039;s not mentioned on their vendor page, you&#039;re best to PM them first prior to placing your order. However, if the vendor posted on his vendor&#039;s page that FE is NOT required and then changes his mind,&nbsp; requesting you do so, you have every right to request that the vendor cancels the order.

I received my two recent orders from MiMM without any issues. If he asks you to FE via PM, just request that he cancel the order. How hard is that. Sounds like you FE and nothing arrived. That&#039;s no ones fault but your own. You do realize that there will always be packages that won&#039;t make it through. There is a risk! Learn from your mistake and move on mate.

More packages means an increased risk that some will be intercepted when compared to an average vendor shipping out 20 - 50+&nbsp; packages each week. This thread was solely created because a new buyer FE and their package didn&#039;t arrive, something which has happened to most of us at one stage or another (just the package not arriving that is).

Just because a package doesn&#039;t arrive doesn&#039;t mean the vendor is a scammer! What about all the packages that have arrived safely world wide, including mine on many occasions?

Just because a package doesn&#039;t arrive doesn&#039;t mean the vendor is a scammer! What about all the packages that have arrived safely world wide, including mine on many occasions?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you have been here for a couple years it&#039;s pretty easy to see. compare him to good vendors and proven scammers. Is this your personal forum account,&nbsp; MarijuanaIsMyMuse? Seems like you are very happy to waste your time defending him.

				I always wondered what would happen to a reputable vendor if one day their shit got messed up or they decided enough is enough... How long could they get away with taking peoples money before disappearing forever.<br /><br />I have learnt a lesson or two along the way, over time you see cracks in vendors profiles and to me its a sign to steer clear. <br /><br />In regards to MarijuanaIsMyMuse i cant comment. 2nd post on the forums tho calling someone out? Meh.

				I&#039;ve heard several stories about this, but I&#039;ve never personally been affected. If he is a scammer, he is a selective one at that. I&#039;m currently on some of the MDMA that was sent from him. <br /><br />

In this case though, what youve heard is actually true. According to many people whos word i will take to the bank. <br /><br />I posted in another thread just a few min ago, elaborating on this a bit.

				PepperidgeFarms and The Cali Connect are selling counterfeit addys. They are described as orange but come light pink and they have no effects, or bad effects (nausea, headache, lightheaded). They refuse to send what was paid for. There are many different kinds of generic, but these definitely don&#039;t contain the real ingredients and you can&#039;t find them anywhere on the net except on sites warning you about them. There is a warning out from FDA about these fake ones. Pepperidge was legit on first order, then took me on the larger second one. If anyone else has this problem speak up. I don&#039;t want anyone else to throw out a bunch of coin for worthless fakes. I suspect some are selling fakes because they got scammed and don&#039;t want to be left holding the bag.
