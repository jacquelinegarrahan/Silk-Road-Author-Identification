				guys, Im new to silk road, Ive made about 3 succesful order&#039;s, All domestic and only just learning PGP. But im having a hard time dealing with the fact i feel like ALOT of australian&#039;s are ordering internatially and recieving the goods. I HATE the idea of FE&#039;ing on anything over $200. But EVERY good vendor pretty much says on the vendor profile that AUS/NZ has to FE. Can someone shed some light on my situation? Perhaps an aussy thats paying $90 - $200 per gram of coke, Instead of $500 (me)....... If i FE what stop&#039;s them from just not sending it? It can&#039;t be just your feedback? It would be so easy for them to say &quot;Custom&#039;s Must Have Got it&quot; or whatever. I dunno, Any help would be greatly appreciated

				Very good question mate. I&#039;m in AU and I have suspicion that some overseas vendors maybe doing this. if the order turns up in australia and is picked up by customs is going to get a love letter sent in return right down to a 5mw laser pointer upto 30 of the highest strength opioid narcotic tablets. if you didn&#039;t get a letter from customs in NSW within 2 weeks of it due to be landing here then it disapeared before reaching AU or it was never sent. for all 100% legal items from USA/UK/China/Germany in envolope or small parcel has out of over 400 ordered only 1 has not turned up and that may have been a legit missin/misslabeled delivery so for the amount I have ordered that I havn&#039;t heared anything about by customs is to many to not be atleast 90% lies. <br /><br />dont let this turn you off but some are a hell of a lot better at stealth than others and there is one that sells cola that I can think of that yes does require FE that if I have ever had any trouble has helped me out and then some. even tho you have FE&#039;d if your a buyer with good stats and/or a returning customer will go above and beyond the call of duty to please you. cola quality compaired to some other overseas is classed as good not great or excellent but atleast you feel secure purchasing. all these ones with slightly better rated quality are from my belief there domestic customers.<br /><br />much safer stealth right down to concealments to slip through to even flagged addresses.<br /><br />contact me and I will ask them if they are happy with your custom. there picky now as look after mainly established customers.<br /><br />$120-$125AU a gram for cola but at times have fishscale and crack as well all slight different price. crack is not an AU common form right?<br /><br />PM in the road same user is best please just search drugexperam and click on found user

				Only order from OS if you are poor. Not worth the risk otherwise.
