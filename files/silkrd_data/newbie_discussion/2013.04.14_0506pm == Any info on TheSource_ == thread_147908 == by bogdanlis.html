				Has anyone done any business with The Source? They have been a vendor for 8 months but only have 7 transactions, none ranked, but 100% positive feedback. Nothing on their page, though.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />BL<br />

				I&#039;m not sure about their history as I&#039;m fairly new too, but I ordered from the source on Wed night and I&#039;ve not heard or seen anything from them. The order is still processing after 4 days, no shipment. I ordered from another vendor the same night and only ordered from the source because the other guy had a limited supply (better price though). That ordered arrived yesterday. I&#039;ve put in 4 orders so far and everyone of them has been shipped the next day until now. The site shows that the source was last seen online 2 days ago, so I would assume they saw the order before maybe going away for the weekend, I don&#039;t know. Hopefully nothing happened to them, but I have a fairly large order in and I cannot just leave my money sit there, so I&#039;ll be canceling the order as soon as the site lets me.

				I had the exact same problem. But when I was able to propose a resolution I accidentally sent the funds despite not having received the order.<br /><br />Lesson learned - never order again from this a-hole. <br /><br />Hope nothing happened to the source, I&#039;m just pissed that I lost out here, the source clearly never sent out the order via 2 day USPS, that was almost 2 weeks. So I paid for an order I never received.
