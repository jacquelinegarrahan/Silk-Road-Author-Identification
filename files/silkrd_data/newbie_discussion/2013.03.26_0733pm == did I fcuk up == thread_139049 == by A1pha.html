				I am old skool, old time smoker and was totally unaware of sr existence until Sunday just gone. I have in recent years had more and more hassle sourcing good quality weed locally and my employer introduced random piss tests so have reduced my toking down to almost nothing, but I love a smoke and miss it terribly.<br /><br />I was reading the paper in bed sunday morning when I read an article about the eBay of drugs and thought it was a load of bollox but it mentioned the site by name so I took to investigating and within a couple of hours had made 2 orders for weed. I had gone from never hearing of the site or btc to having 10 btc and spent 2 btc on weed which I am hoping will arrive tomorrow. <br /><br />only after the initial buzz of finding the site and browsing the wares do I consider the implications. ...<br /><br />firstly I am using a shared (family) android tablet running ics. I downloaded orbot from the play store and am connecting to tor using firefox, I have no other security, I am infact posting here from that very setup. I am, to say the least technophobic and have not a clue how or why it all connects but I am worried I have left a trail for the police.<br /><br />have I fcuked up.? is there any retrospective steps I can take or should I expect to get my door kicked in etc.<br /><br />like I said I am old skool and apart from smoking the herb I dont commit any crime, I work 50 hours a week and support my family I am not interested in becoming a vendor so dont want mega security hut would just like to sleep easier knowing the babylon are not going to cuff me.<br /><br />I do have access to a shared laptop running windows, should I connect there in future or is that now futile. if I diid start using the laptop with my current buyer name then surely the two would be connected anyway, a change of username might help.? <br /><br />I have also been reading about pgp. I sent my name and address in plain text so am worried about that too...<br /><br />anyway enough for now...peace brothers and sisters.<br /><br />

				Specifically there are things you could do better - in particular PGP is important since it protects you if SR ever gets busted. If you&#039;re really paranoid you&#039;ll stick with the desktop browser not the tablet version since that&#039;s more proven. However in the big scheme of things these are minor points.<br /><br />Nothing is ever completely risk free, but you should be fine.
