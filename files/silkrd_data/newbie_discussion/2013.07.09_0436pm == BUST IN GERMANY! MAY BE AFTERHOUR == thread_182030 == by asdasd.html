				I would have liked to post in the real thread, but it is too exhausting to get 50 messages for me.<br /><br />Anyway, there has been another bust in Germany (connected with Bitcoin and most probably silk road): <br /><br />http://www.presseportal.de/polizeipresse/pm/11562/2511405/pol-e-essen-hagen-hagener-polizei-fuehrt-schlag-gegen-internethandel-mit-ecstasy-tabletten<br /><br />Does anyone have an idea which vendor they busted in NRW?

				I used google translator and understood in general the main idea.<br /><br />I could have 2 explainations why this happen: <br />&nbsp;- somebody who may know those vendors, went to police and told everything they do in darknet<br />&nbsp;- may be the vendors used often same post offices and like this police could catch them<br /><br />any other idea?<br /><br />but it sucks that things like this happen and it also sucks that some government decides what I am allowed and what I am not allowed to consume. <br />I drink alcohol which is legal but still dangerous<br />&nbsp;but I love cocaine, marihuana and lsd. <br />anyway it does not interest my government what I love. I should be like the other 99% of population. <br /><br />Its not democracy, its a slavery we live in&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />

They are going to have to arrest everyone to be able to stop the illegal drug trade. New generations are born everyday and living in this society is bound to lead to drug use. So they are F*kd.

				So this is the &quot;real&quot; discussion about the bust: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182012.30<br /><br />I agree that SR has to act quickly to protect customers. Many are not aware of the situation (cf. AH&#039;s reviews &quot;Just received it. Everythings just perfect. But i never received the track and trace number.&quot;,....). I wouldn&#039;t like to be in their shoes.

				I can&#039;t post in the other forums, so I&#039;ll post it here. Someone who claims to have (limited) inside information claims they busted them by observing the postal office where the courier sent the packages. The busted courier led them to the seller. Now bavarian police thinks they are the kings of the interwebs because they busted the Silk Road.

				It&#039;s like ripping off one tiny, little tree branch amongst thousands of other tiny, little tree branches. You have the branch but the trunk, the source of all branches, remains, and in time, another branch will grow in it&#039;s place.

				One can spew pseudo-philosophical fooey even when one is completely sober (which I am). Not a real fan of cannabis anyways.. it dims the mind when used too often.
