				I&#039;m trying to figure out what dose I&#039;d need to take (considering I do about a 1/2g of BTH a day) and what the regiment would be like. I&#039;d like to set this up so that when I am mentally prepared to go off the dope I can take the easy route out.

				Subs are a miracle drug for kicking, but be careful, they are addictive too, and, I think, have even worse WDs, you can work yourslf down to the tiniest lil crumbs of sub, and still feel like shit when all&#039;s said and done.. There is a regiment of things I use to help kick, one thing, that not a lot of people seem to know about is something called&nbsp; CalMag, you can get it at health food stores, it relaxes your muscles, the stuff works, and fast.

				Hey, I am on vivitrol now because suboxone really wasnt helping me. Vivitrol blocks the opiate/alcohol receptor for an extended release period of 28-30 days. Suboxone is really only good short term in my opionion, with serious canidates for wanting to get off opiates &#039;COMPLETLEY&#039;. I still like to fk around so vivitrol prevents me from even thinkin about it cuz i know I cant get high for x amount of days after each shot. <br /><br />Be careful and read up on suboxone, main dangers are mixing with other narcotics esp benzos, and addiction to it of course. I never thought i would withdrawal from suboxone after I took it because I hadnt before. To dose suboxone you will need to be off heroin for 12-24 hours , oxy and all rapid acting opiates 24/48 hours , methadone 36+ hours. And to use vivitrol extended release you need 7-10 days off all opiates, all this is due to the precipiated withdrawal<br /><br />After being on it for a year almost my doc cut me off and I had to kick. Took two weeks of being cold and unstable mentally but im good. I relapsed in Janurary cuz my medicine has been having issues getting sent out. I would make sure to plan on not being on it long , or keep using or get the vivitrol injections. GL<br /><br />by the way even after 3 full months off suboxone and when i relapsed due to no shot being in my docs office, didnt take but one go around to feel the WD&#039;s again. This time only took a week to feel normal
