				People selling 10mg percocets for $15<br />.. selling 30mg Roxys for 35-40 bucks.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Seriously?<br /><br />I have been frequenting SR occasionally to feel out the prices and the last time Roxys were being sold for under $25 was a year and a half ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost as though the vendors all got together and agreed not to undercut each other to keep the prices universally high&nbsp; (e.g. cable companies).&nbsp; Prices are better locally and that should never be the case, considering the number of people selling these meds on SR at any given time.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re selling for these kinds of prices, go fuck yourself.

				Here we go with this shit again. Every month. Without fail. If you think the prices here are too expensive, why not buy them elsewhere on the street? <br />(Never mind you run the risk of getting robbed, ripped off, sold bunk pills, arrested, pulled over driving home and searched, having a IRL source run dry.. etc).<br />Ever think about it the other way? You press a few buttons on your computer, and 2 days later you have your goodies waiting for you at your doorstep. You&#039;re paying a premium for the convenience, anonymity, reliability and quality.

				Or hold off taking OC until the price comes down, what a novel idea. If you really &quot;needed&quot; it you would have a prescription and not be abusing them.<br /><br />It&#039;s just simple economics, if there is no listings would you rather it stay dry completely.. Or someone in your position who can only buy street price to begin with offers some for a small price increase in order for there to be product available for those willing.

				Uh oh.. Don Modzi is back in action.<br /><br />To the OP - as someone who enjoys the occasional, yummy blue pill from time to time.. I have no issue with any of the prices any of the roxi vendors here vend for. And NO, I&#039;m not a vendor. I&#039;m a buyer, I&#039;m a buyer in good standing, and I&#039;m on good terms with most of the top rx vendors and you are not simply paying for a fucking pill. You&#039;re paying for a SERVICE, you&#039;re paying for ANONYMITY, you&#039;re paying for NEAR 0% RISK, you&#039;re paying for GAURANTEED PRODUCT (with escrow/resolution etc), you&#039;re PAYING FOR CONVENIENCE.<br /><br />Now, the fact that I can afford the prices here.. makes me think.. either they&#039;re fair, or hell.. even cheaper then they probably could go for. If the roxy vendors here raised their prices, it will take me all of 2 minutes to think about it and conclude &quot;fuck it, time to order!&quot;. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not happy with the prices, perhaps you can partake in another DOC?

				people sell the pills at those prices because people keep buying them. if no one bought the damn things dealers would be forced to cut prices in order to move the product.&nbsp; oxy is also a more socially acceptable drug then lets say: heroin.&nbsp; seems pretty simple to me as it takes an upwards of four oxy30s a day to keep me good and that is alot of money!!!!&nbsp; :&#039;(

				You know how hard they are to acquire these days? This isn&#039;t 10 years ago, 5 years ago, or even 1 year ago. Doctor&#039;s are fucking mortified to prescribe them. <br />They are so hard to get. Harder then coke, weed, HEROIN, etc. The vendors getting them, are literally jumping through hoops to acquire them (in my opinion).. and there are associated costs with those hoops. I&#039;m not sure what kind of profit margin you think the Rx vendors make.. and I frankly don&#039;t know or care. But I can tell you they are not getting the pills at $3 dollars a Roxi and then marking them up to $33 just cuz they can. <br /><br />Anyways, this whole topic is just weird. It all boils down to people wanting to get high who can&#039;t afford to.<br /><br />There are two solutions to this problem.<br />A) Stop getting high<br />B) Afford to<br /><br />

				If there&#039;s one category of drugs I&#039;ll never buy from SR, it&#039;s prescription opiates. The prices here are absolutely ridiculous... your money&#039;s better spent on other drugs. I&#039;ve always found prescription drugs to be the easiest to find connects for.

				Ladies and Gents, I will be doing the Oxycodone vendors and clients a service on Silk Road. The prices for Opiates on Silk Road are too high. As expressed in this thread, they are more then street and more then even other smaller vendors on Silk Road. And the main issue is Silk Road has not implemented a &quot;Sort by Price&quot; feature in their Main Site Search Function. I am sure this works to the benefit of the gentleman vendors who are charging a high markup for these pills, but not for the buyers. So I am going to even the playing field.<br /><br />I will, every day, post a list of the Opiate for sale on Silk Road BY PRICE and post that information here in order of lowest to highest. :)<br />I know that the higher prices vendors will be annoyed, but there is no reason to be. It is just a service I am providing. There are some vendors charging $21 dollars a pill for a 30mg Oxydone (less then $1 per 1mg), and there are Vendors charging DOUBLE that price. And buyers, due to sheer laziness, niavete, or foolishness.. do not see this.<br /><br />So, every day I am going to post an updated list to help our opiate community with the followin information:<br /><br />Vendor John Doe - Roxicodone 30mg $22.50 per pill (Vendor Listing URL)<br />Vendor Mary Jane - Roxycodone 30mg $26 per pill (with free shiping) (Vendor Listing URL)<br />Vendor Joe Blow - Roxycodone 30mg $ 30 per pill&nbsp; (Vendor Listing URL)<br />Vendor Greedy McGreedster - Roxycodone 30mg $35 per pill (Vendor Listing URL)<br />Vendor Gordon Geckko - Roxycodone 30mg $42.50 per pill (Vendor Listing URL) <br /><br />Will this be well received my friends? Methinks so :) I will also be PMing the vendors our of respect to inform them that I will be providing this free &quot;advertising&quot; if you will to enlighten the community of all the various options out there, instead of having to pay more then the next guy is charging.<br /><br />I am positive this is the best alternative to &quot;Sort by Price&quot;, that will finally enable customers to understand that paying $53 dollars for a pill that another vendor (with great feedback) is selling for half price! <br /><br />I will be doing this every day starting tomorrow. If it is well received, which it will, I will take it upon myself to start a similar list of &quot;price sorted - lowest to highest&quot; list and post it every day with the Kocaine Vendors and THEIR listings as well. Again, same problem.. lack of awareness.<br /><br />I&#039;ve reached out to a few of the vendors already about my plan to help the community. Several were VERY responsive and thankful that this is being done. <br />Perhaps this will foster more competitive pricing and businesses practices amongst the Rx, Cocaine, and (eventually) the Marijuana Vendors.<br />I&#039;m sorry higher priced vendors, if you feel this is not helpful.. but, it is morally acceptable and I am not breaking any rules. Hell, it&#039;s free advertising for you!<br /><br />I look forward to being the Human Sort By Price of the Silk Road Forums. It&#039;s time for a change. Change has come.<br /><br />Kowboy!

				Totally agree with KoCaineKowboy...Something got to be done about these prices...Around me hydrocodone go for $5 a pill...Some dealers do 6 and people talk hella shit...So being a person that gets rid of hydrocodone 10/325 (WATSON or Vz)I would love to come on here and find a vendor thats getting rid of hes for 2-3 bucks a pill. I would love to do bussiness with that person for a long time and im sure other people would aswell... <br /><br />And just to be clear..Im talking about buying 300+ pills at a time...I dont mean 2-3 dollors for someone buying like 10 pills or something...<br /><br />So if there is any vendor willing to do that for me, I am a repeat customer (every week) and will be for quite some time as im sure other people also that come accross this will be aswell.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />New to the community///New to everything including pgp/// So hopefully i did this write...If i didnt just post a reply on here for me.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQENBFGICKgBCADJ6rs7XEUfjOPleg413zR7O77Mqye/ZbRqUrdPouA25+tBEOmk<br />kNtEV3v5hmfk2pVCdu0qrPxRrlQHu3MagodhkdgSnlIZHVNbunm41kGO+UxlpdUs<br />IvcK/Ra8IVAVMSPLyCdq+clwQp/ybOgw0Uh/iuJXhwpgGRWD+A6mD/hxdJgtVNWa<br />a7DuUxJlrrGxITpeqkEoNdl2NHWZHTLm6a5Uz61I+l/7+lcsDt1v0MUiqEq61OoI<br />r9A/YpIZdH5jbgpODMC0mcEVYTKLx2RnYOTfifNwUVgDAhNnJxhSEh9dcsho8ZyC<br />Hp07IKE0qkUrJ8s4KxC3PPIg1Ya/IeqMem/dABEBAAG0C0pvc2ggVGFuZGVyiQE3<br />BBMBCgAhBQJRiAioAhsDBQsJCAcDBRUKCQgLBRYCAwEAAh4BAheAAAoJEBXfxHJx<br />lVYf3J0H/1PZSTYHaDQcxojt4PKLcrvEfWqdexXHE5Li4ymSEdktwvBGSXcJBNIs<br />9xWvEkhCc+WgwMTapXDLzB9eDSjn8SqQ9j8n2pNCu4uO8LEzjURYPPU4/eqiwW3K<br />w7hiqdmMZu1WN2A7LfiCs83Vf1wT8v88kAp7/FB5gIopQzbGmGxfzha9dmrasaiL<br />+bHutz9Ad834i+LDdQ8UDiPk5sAMVkvZWz7s+5g7TlGIoU7/9Se+4g7tPkPboYDE<br />LhKq3LBy4JtqehO6QZzuFxPmsskWDedlRgm2nYOuNOehE2D38uyp0ii7qznaBX92<br />FHRefKadcE2Q5bcrpPlSGjzmtWAOND25AQ0EUYgIqAEIAMSuLsSC/mB6u9DKTVgC<br />gMefK/cLKx02tg6mTc3tQNzrH9AWuZUSZ1pQmZkog4fWlXhfR3u3Rz8oMU9MBCVt<br />7w7NTMMqrvPPEVMaxWeuDUcwkCHmSRQjl/6hHM6KJDWrQ/5JGiFr1+6r9f08JN0G<br />JF/DNNC5ca4k1cMPKwvbsJD3W84lpqhYWERFS5K9dj+i04u7bbPvV0cSP9pZ62Ik<br />r9faU10n/pOCLkWpeuSeK1Lm2tB1TxxYukvpuUAufXoyGceoIs1rLW/d4TsaaCkp<br />htPGospAOLQ+WLSO7QIUomAxMLHQB9JJC+YO7m4lHfs4lke0KpDajbrF1KPQleu4<br />tjcAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQoACQUCUYgIqAIbDAAKCRAV38RycZVWH5zyCADAxeG1Fcmd<br />0VBBcN1/8VLDfWZqY4aPIfSJTUF6gaQoIFNOdQHTg/CfhRR9Q2yRjYzc1elqsL5D<br />gi7APlkh6etwoS4SwPDTZa9/885qd5YS8BGMUNQB7tqKimQ6/AHETmjNXFb7IBRU<br />EnKb2UL67G73ASymrI5a8qA5UdRL3uDbZf1Fu2i7XYSeXaZN9eXguzJ+fvAllbGi<br />qCD6EJWpFQxdvthTasIxBIMtsdO/EwZH3A6gssxe6o8wuG2bZvIBB8TUlI/x4D9W<br />5pAZuRdr1D4C8lx9GlfNvPCi3ImWrx8E6bMpPtj9skufqc5G+HfBYwDUpMBJ7ZxY<br />TRq/GJWjt61c<br />=UiVv<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
