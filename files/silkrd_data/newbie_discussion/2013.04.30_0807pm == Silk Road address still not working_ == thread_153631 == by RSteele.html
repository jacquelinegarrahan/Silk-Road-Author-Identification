				I have checked out both Atlantis and BMR. They just do not feel right to me. Maybe down the road. Much better to wait for SR. They will find a solution. Only issue is how much time. Nothing wrong with a little patience. Might be an opportunity to clean up a bit, and get a little smarter about preserving one&#039;s anonymity.<br />PS - Fuck the douche-scum hackers.
