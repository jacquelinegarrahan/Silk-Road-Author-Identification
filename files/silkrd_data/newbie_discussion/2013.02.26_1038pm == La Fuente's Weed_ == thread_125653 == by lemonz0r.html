				I noticed this listing the other day, and I could barely believe my eyes! Â£40 for an ounce! And even better, his reviews seem to check out for the most part. <br /><br />Has anyone bought from him before?&nbsp; How&#039;s the quality?

				I should be getting an oz from his very shortly now. The shipping time is something to be desired but you can&#039;t beat that price. I&#039;ll let you know in a few days how it is. Hopefully tomorrow...

				La Fuente&#039;s 1 oz listing was the first thing I purchased on the Road over two months ago. It took about three weeks to arrive, but it got here. The price cant be beat, and for being Mexican weed its actually pretty decent quality.<br /><br />The only downside is that you are pretty much rolling the dice, its not easy to get an oz of weed through US customs coming from Mexico.<br />

				That listing caught my eye too but being my first order I decided to us domestic vendors. Seemed risky to me especially from Mexico. Also I don&#039;t mind a 1-10g package being found but no that amount.

				Hi,<br />I received 10g of weed from LaFuente, it took about a month to reach my mailbox. Stealth was ok, not amazing but good enough, the weed was very compressed and vacuumsealed, no smell at all when I opened the package.<br /><br />Quality was very good, it really impressed me to get this kind of weed for this cheap price, it was well dried and trimmed, nice aroma and very good high. I ordered an once a few days ago,&nbsp; hope the quality will be same and that the package will easily cross borders, but at this price I just can&#039;t resist to order more !<br /><br />WL

				UPDATE: just got in the mail today. Took about 18 days altogether. Talk about compression lol but its a surprisingly nice smoke. I&#039;ll leave a more detailed review in his actual thread once i reach the almighty 50. Almost there..... very annoying....

				hi,<br />smoke sound alright for the price, and i think it would be good to use as filler for joints etc or for when times are hard. Any UK experience with him? Only thing that puts me off is the fact that it has to come from Mexico and it will be an amount which have people asking questions if itis caught out.Would Mexico raise any flags... anymore than normal?

Only reason I mentioned it earlier was I was curious if anyone really knew.
