				I know the best H was with KingDavid as of yesterday, not sure if he has any left. Rumored to be the BEST china white #4 any one here has ever had or seen. <br /><br />Sadly once those listings are gone he will no longer be vending H. Not sure about blow, i dont buy that here.

				Smilea While&#039;s #4 although he has stopped now.&nbsp; Incredibly strong (nearly fell out).&nbsp; #3 is C63amg (Dutch no USA).&nbsp; I honestly enjoyed the sedating effects more than SAW&#039;s #4 at times so really rate his stuff.&nbsp; Coke?&nbsp; Not had too much luck but the first ever batch of SpanishFly at his original prices was incredible.&nbsp; His 2nd batch (I havn&#039;t tried) got some mixed reviews.&nbsp; Anyone try GoldenHorse?&nbsp; He supposed to be shipping source from safer country.&nbsp;

				Cant speak for H haven&#039;t tried (am curious though but also reluctant)<br /><br />For C on the other hand I have great experience (actually kinda proud of that - possibly insane...)<br />In Europe I have tried quite some vendors and I have to say the two best ones in my humble experience (SR 40 something transactions - all C)<br /><br />FrankMatthews, very good gear - I mean VERY good, quality almost the same over time - very little variation - reasonable prices and fast service <br /><br />C63AMG, fast as fucking hell in delivery, a bit more variation in quality but still in the very high end
