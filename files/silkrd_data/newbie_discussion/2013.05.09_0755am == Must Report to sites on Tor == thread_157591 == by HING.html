				As much as I hate to do this, I have to inform everybody on the Tor network that is 90 percent done.<br />I hate sites like these, trust as much as I have inform clients of the TOR network, that the final steps taken of TOR, is going to be 100 find proof I have to say that.&nbsp; I know some people might happy some not, trust me I really don&#039;t approve, But what can do. <br /><br />Thank you

				It&#039;s unclear what we&#039;re supposed to be unhappy about. I take it that English is a second language for you.<br /><br />You mean to say that the anonymity of Tor is compromised? I find that unlikely, though I suppose anything is possible.<br /><br />You might want to try running your intended message from whatever your original language is into English through Google translate. As it stands, your warning (threat? intel?) is basically incomprehensible.

				This seems like an awful lot of effort to go to.<br /><br />It&#039;s easier to induce paranoia if you actually speak the language of the potentially paranoid.
