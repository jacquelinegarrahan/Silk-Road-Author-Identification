				Looking for how to get bitcoins from a trustworthy place. They seem cool, but it&#039;s so easy to get scammed so I just need to get others opinions before I send the cash.

It is basically a site where people can sell or buy bitcoins. There is a rep system and reviews for the different vendors. There are also different ways to pay. If you live in a large area you can pay in person in cash, or there are people who take email money transfers, western union, direct bank deposits, and others. Even though you have to pay the vendor first the site does hold the coins in escrow. I think if something were to go wrong then you could simply provide proof that you gave the guy money. For instance I bought mine by putting money directly into this seller&#039;s bank account. At the bank I got a receipt with all his banking information. If he would have said I never gave him the money then I could give a copy of this to the web site and they would have released the coins to me. I used the site a couple of times and had no issues and they are super fast and low transaction fees. As an added bonus I bought bitcoins at a lower price than what SR said they were worth so the extra few dollars covered the transaction fee.

				Yep, localbitcoins= you buying them from other people.<br /><br />These bitcoratio people, if they really had bitcoins that cheap, would sell them on localbitcoins for profit.

				Anyway, OP, check out LibertyCoin. Got the link to him in my signature below. He doesn&#039;t have any feedback on SR because he doesn&#039;t have any listings, but I and others here in the forums have done business with him through email and other services and he&#039;s been excellent. If you search his name here in the forums you&#039;ll find his review thread. I doubt you&#039;ll find anyone selling BTC at a lower rate (I think he&#039;s only charging 6% now), and he accepts cash deposits and MoneyPaks. I was skeptical at first cause he&#039;s a new vendor with no feedback but a friend here vouched for him and I took a chance, glad I did.

First time i bought coins I used cavirtex (in canada) and I had to deposit through a bank account, then it took like 8 hours to get the coins after that. It&#039;s so much quicker with localbitcoins.com
