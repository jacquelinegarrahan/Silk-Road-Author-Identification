				I understand without 50 post this is the only area of the board we can use. But all there is are threads promoting spamming to 50. Now in my mind this completely defeats the purpose of having to have 50 post to reply on other boards. So my question is, does anyone really care if people are just spamming their way out of here? Its seemed to ruin the newb board since I cant hardly track my posts with the constant spamming and bumping those threads up.<br />The whole point is to prove you can be a contributing member and the first 50 are the trial. Maybe im fucked up. Oh well..

				50 is a lot, I think it&#039;s too high. you can be a contributing member with less posts. but people need their 50 to post elsewhere so it&#039;s better we have dedicated spam posts than everyone spaming other posts.

				Well atleast with the btc post their at least making a attempt. I rather reply to that then &quot;wtfomgbbqhaxorz82ie8ririrjfncncndksksoo&quot;. It looks ignorant and like people dont take it seriously. Ive only been a member of the forums for an hour and have over 10 post. They might not be sticky worthy or anything but at least im going to earn my post legitly. I know it doesnt matter and by the looks of it the mods or whatever dont give a shit if they spam. Its just a shame, I have been on other forums amd the minimum post count for full access was moderated very well and it meant something when you got promoted. Just my personal opinion.

I rarely socialise outside of real life anymore due to the lack of maturity and the over abundance of ignornce. People dont care how they treat anyone anymore.. atleast online. If you can hide behind a computer screen your a know it all muscle man who engages in coitus with our mothers. However my interactions on Sr and on the forums with others have been very mature and kind natured. Atleast so far. So heres to a hopefully enriching experience!

To me shrooms have been a much be heady trip while acid allows me to connect with others. Every time I have tripped acid has been the some of the most enjoyable and memorable times of my life. Acid is just wonderful when tripping with a small group of really tight knit friends...really nothing like. Shrooms have always made me very reflective and introverted while I have always been incredibly extroverted on acid(I&#039;m normally somewhere between both, leaning towards introvert) However shrooms have been great to me because they always seem to cut through the bullshit in my life and get me face to face with my problems.

				The difference between Mushrooms (Psilocybin+Psilocin+Baeyocystin) and LSD is enormous from a pharmacological standpoint.<br /><br />Mushrooms are solely a 5HT2A agonist where as LSDs pharmacology has agonist activity at several 5-HT subtypes and during the second half of its duration has notable dopaminergenic activity.<br /><br />Everything else regarding the difference in experience is all subjective.<br /><br />Must hit 50!
