				Well do you already take amphetamines recreationally, ie. adderall? If so yeah these are about twice as strong as adderal per mg. So you can imagine eating/blowing 15mg-25mg of these will get you speeding something fierce (you know, talkin up a storm, ideas and concepts flowin smoothly, pupils all big, completely forgetting the concept of food...lol). Just don&#039;t forget to quit a binge eventually or you might find yourself not having slept in several days and your heart feeling like it is going to explode and your vision blurred to fuck. Depending on the type of pill they are easy or a pain in the ass to blow.

				Dextroamphetamine is the king of amphetamines, excluding dextromethamphetamine. I was prescribed dexedrine at a very young age and have a lot of experience with it. I once took 110 mg and it made cocaine look like pussy powder (I would strongly advise not doing this, it&#039;s way above a safe dosage). It&#039;s way more cerebral and smoother compared to levoamphetamine, which has a lot more peripheral stimulation and vascular effects. I really feel that the reason Adderall is so prevalent as opposed to Dexedrine has a lot more to do with the cost of resolving the enantiomers than its efficacy at treating ADHD. Well, that and the fact that they don&#039;t want kids getting the &quot;rush&quot; of pure dextroamphetamine tablets. So basically they package this shitty amphetamine racemate with sulphate and saccharate salts all mixed in so that they all metabolize and break down at slightly different rates giving an allegedly &quot;smoother&quot; effect. *cough*bullshit!*cough* Feels like shit to me.<br /><br />In short, yeah dextroamphetamine is way better IMO. I&#039;d say 1.5x-2x as strong as adderall in terms of how you feel.

				Do you think if I bought 3x5 mg Tablets it would be enough if I dont use these types of drugs often? Also i love stimulants like coke so would snorting it be a good option?

				since you have low tolerance, 15mg insufflated over a couple hours would definitely keep you relatively high for awhile. Or you could blow it all in one sesh and get a huge rush. You&#039;d def feel it.

				I don&#039;t usually snort any of the tablets because they bioavailability is pretty high already and they will also hit you pretty fast. Plus its only 5mg of active ingredient mixed in with like 300 mg of chalk and filler, you&#039;ll probably just end up swallowing most of it anyway. Although, if you have a pension for snorting stuff then there&#039;s really no reason not to other than the unnecessary strain on your nose.<br /><br />Best thing to do is to dissolve them in a glass of water and let it sit a minute and&nbsp; then drink it down. It will hit you very fast. Some people also like to eat tums 20 mins beforehand to raise their stomach pH some, which will prolong the effects. <br /><br />15mg of IR should be a pretty good dose for a person with little tolerance.
