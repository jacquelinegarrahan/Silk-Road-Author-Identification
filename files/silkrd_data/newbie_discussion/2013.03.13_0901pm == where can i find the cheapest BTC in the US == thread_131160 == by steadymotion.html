				I use CampBX to trade my BTC. Right now they&#039;re going for 45-50 USD. Such is the name of the game, as SR becomes more popular BTC become more valuable. The good news is that most vendors link their prices to the exchange rate, so prices drop (in BTC) to match the rising exchange rate.

				The street value is way less, this made me laugh. Of course the street value is less. SR gets a cut and you are paying full retail price. <br /><br />Not a good place to shop if you are totally strung out as the turn around time is too long and the prices are high. But are they really high? Not for me. Convenience and selection. Fuck yeah.<br /><br />Go buy dilaudid on the street and try and be picky about the manufacturer. <br /><br />Here I can be picky about the individual brand if I like. Reminds me of buying Heroin in New York in the late 90&#039;s. <br /><br />Yo I got magneto, kangaroo, blah blah blah. Shit brand was everything. Heroin in El Paso was how far into Segundo Barrio was I willing to go before cashing out. A couple times I was too picky and was relieved of my cash.<br /><br />Coping dope in Cuidad Chihuahua was wild. 20 pesos for a flap, kind of like a bag in New York, but they didn&#039;t sell by the bundle. Took about 5 flaps to get well or about $10. The dope was good, just sold in such small amounts.

				BTC is at market price, you can&#039;t get it cheaper.<br /><br />If someone is telling you they&#039;ll give it to you cheaper, then its a scam.<br /><br />The best you can do is find a exchange that has a low fee.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be so cheap, people like you are ruining SR.
