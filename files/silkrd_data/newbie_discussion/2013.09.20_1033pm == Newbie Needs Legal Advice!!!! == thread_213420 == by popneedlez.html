				A friend had a package intercepted (200g sched 1) and is completely freaking out lol. Rather than receiving a love letter or getting a CD, the package was brought to him by the postal inspector, an fbi agent, and about 6 other local police officers. He said they claimed they had record of him tracking the package from his ip address. Off the bat they told him he wasn&#039;t going to jail, that they just wanted to know where he got the stuff from. He told them BMR. They then asked him to sign a search form and they searched his house and car, he consented as he didn&#039;t have anything to hide. The cops found some old methandrostenolone (dbol) he&#039;s had for a while but the cops took it bc they had no way of testing it then and there. He said they found no drug paraphernalia because he didn&#039;t have any. They also found a roach in his roommates room and wrote him a ticket for disordly misconduct: marijuana....and gave him a courtdate. Wtf??<br /><br />The way the whole thing played out didn&#039;t sound right but bc he&#039;s my bot I told this fool that he&#039;s ok because if they wanted to lock his white ass up then they would have by now. They didn&#039;t allow the drugs to get into his possession, then take him down afterwards. It just seems like they were fishing for information. <br /><br />Anybody have anything similar happen? Probably would fare better in the legal section, but hey, I&#039;m a noob. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Probably why most vendors don&#039;t give out tracking info, do not track that sort of thing.&nbsp; And obviously they knew they did not have enough evidence of him ordering it, or he would have been arrested.

				Dude I hate to sound abrasive but your friend is a moron. In those situations, never talk to police and never consent to searches. All my scuffles with the law (non-SR related) I&#039;ve always been able to get out of jams scott free or have them knock down to fines and community service. Trust me, cops will always lie to get info out of you and anything you say to them will never help out your situation. Always keep your mouth shut, it&#039;s in the constitution and you never have to incriminate yourself.<br />&nbsp;I hope all works out well for your friend and just tell him to stay quiet from then on out and to chip in some money for a lawyer. Even if they let him off on a recog, still lawyer up. I hope this helps and stay safe.

				I have to agree with Yoda. Especially because they found other drugs on the premises then thats more than sufficient evidence to put your friend away for a LONG time. And to just walk away from a major bust? A deepweb blackmarket bust that would probably get them all major promotions and advance their careers? This sounds really fishy to me and I would stay clear of him. At the very least he&#039;s probably under surveillance.

He said they didn&#039;t check any computers, cellphones, or anything like that. He recently sold his camaro and literally had $14k in cash in a shoebox that was still there after the search. Shit baffles me. Id be pissed if my first online purchase went this way! I know people who have gotten love letters before but not a CD. Hell I don&#039;t even think of this as a CD because the never allowed him to obtain the package...they brought it to his ass lol

Now that does not mean that your friend is going to just get a slap on the wrist. Even people charged with felonies may only be issued a court date as long as they are determined non-violent and will not cause any harm to society. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the best way to access how much trouble your friend is in. If the summons is for municipal court, then he is in little trouble and may only get a misdemeanor charge or a city violation. These generally result in fines and community service. Also, with the help of a lawyer they can get these charges sealed or expunged.<br /><br />Now if the summons is for magistrate court, Then your friend is in bigger trouble. This court deals with felonies and jail time may be a possibility. Hopefully this isn&#039;t the case.<br /><br />The lawyer is a good idea for many reasons. The main one being that they know the law, procedures, and how courts work better than you. Also, the best part that lawyers (especially good ones) have connections to politicians, law enforcement, judges, and prosecutors. They work with these people on a regular basis and may have befriended them. The benefit to this is that your lawyer will be able to put &quot;feelers&quot; out and direct you to take the right steps while suffering the least amount of consequences. Never get a public defender, they are usually fresh law school grads and are overworked and under appreciated. They may work up to 50 case at one time which tells you they aren&#039;t going to put in a lot of effort for you. Poor bastards, I hope they make it out of there one day but I digress.<br /><br />Anywho, sorry for the late respond and I hope this info helps you and your friend. Stay safe :)<br /><br />&nbsp;
