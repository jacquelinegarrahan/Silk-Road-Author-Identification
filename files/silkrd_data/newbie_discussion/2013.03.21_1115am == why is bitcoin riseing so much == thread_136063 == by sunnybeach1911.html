				Because people are losing faith in &#039;regular&#039; money and resort to real money (uninfluenced by a middle man) instead. <br /><br />When will it stop? No one knows for sure.. it might rise to $10.000 for 1Btc, or higher.

				^^^^I believe this guy is right. the vendor picks a dollar amount and that stays constant. My question is ok I am a vendor and my product is 60$. The bitcoin goes up and down through out the day, so how often does the SR refresh the bitcoin rate and where do they get that rate from.<br /><br />As far as why it keeps going up so fats we money always attracts money and the more the coin becomes worth the more attention it will bring (for better or worse).

				The currency ($, Lb, Euro, whatever) to Bitcoin is almost completely irrelevant here.&nbsp; Most of the vendors set their prices in $US and then SR converts it to bitcoin.&nbsp; You can see everything in SR in $US if you click account (top of the page) and then settings (right side)<br /><br />So you take $100 cash and get $100 worth of bitcoins, you then use those bitcoins to buy $100 worth of weed.&nbsp; The $/bitcoin exchange rate didn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; The only time it will affect you is if you HOLD bitcoins for an extended time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Capiche? <br /><br />

				The most probable reason for bitcoin skyrocketing during the past two months is Cyprus. Russians stand to lose money there, so they are in a hurry to find another laundering place for their less-than-legal funds. On a short term, it may be very difficult, hence even Bitcoin will do. Bitcoin&#039;s liquidity is poor, so just a 100 000 EUR may push the price up by 1-2%. And since deposits are not safe in Cyprus, they aren&#039;t safe in Spain etc. I read somewhere that bitcoin software downloads have skyrocketed in Spain during recent days.<br /><br />IMO people are jumping from the frying pan into the fire. <br />

				Well I do not know what the cause is but I have definitely enjoyed it! I jumped in on the 19th with most all I have in liquid cash around 3 grand and am up 25% , almost 800 dollars right now. keeping 400 in to play with and cashing out the rest. Free shit is the best shit! I have done this in the stock market before but the first time with coin. Still hard to know when to cut and run, hate to leave money on the table.<br />&nbsp;As far as SR update I see it change every 5 min or less but I cant tell where they get their info cause its always off compared to all major exchanges a whole percent or two low right now. I would love to know how they calculate this. probably just need to ask properly.&nbsp; I would also like to know what happens to all the residual coin that seems to vanish like&nbsp; the .00739 of a&nbsp; bitcoin I added to my account but cant see and then when I pay I see the charge goes to the 4th decimal but again&nbsp; my off SR wallet shows this before deposit but then not on SR till I pay someone. This would add up to tons of coin if it was siphoned as they say. Bitcoin will have to go to like a metric system if it goes much higher like millacoin, centacoin, ect. I think this would work with the current system. Anyway so there is that.

				A lot of people claim that silver is due to rise too. A couple of years ago it was up to $44/oz. Now I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s $28. They say it usually stabilizes at a fixed percentage compared to gold, like 16 to 1 (don&#039;t remember the real figure) and it&#039;s therefore too low.

It is important for traders that the currency is stable. As the past months have shown, Bitcoin is very volatile. For the time being, many vendors make more money from holding Bitcoin than selling stuff. But how about when they have sold something, mailed the stuff and wait for the escrow to be released? If Bitcoin crashes meanwhile, they could selling at a loss. If I want to gamble, I go to a Casino. If I want to trade, I don&#039;t want Bitcoin.<br /><br />Hopefully someone invents a stable cryptocoin. It would be OK if it was pegged to the USD or EUR.

				Well I think it&#039;s obvious the tax returns in the US have a big part to do with it... If you look at a lot of the charts BTC only really shot up in price within the last 30days...

				I always get nervous when it&#039;s fluctuates so much like it&#039;s done over the past 1-2 weeks.<br />If you&#039;ve got a lot of BTC, I personally think it&#039;s always best to cash out early to play it safe and not push the friend ship hoping for a bigger increase.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-20/jittery-spaniards-seek-safe-haven-in-bitcoins<br />I think it is pretty much settled, that the recent days&#039; mindless activity came from Europe. Downloads of Bitcoin client software has increased wildly in Spain. What is happening in Cyprus has proved that bank accounts in euroland are not safe. If it can happen in Cyprus, it can happen in Spain, Portugal, Ireland... I doubt many of those first-time Bitcoin users who bough this week, know what they&#039;re doing. What goes up, must come down (sometime): http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-21/us-begins-regulating-bitcoin-will-consider-virtual-transactions-money-laundering

				The main exchange moved operations over to the US via coinbase, so its seen as being more secure now. And alot of mainstream businesses are adopting it.

				yeah, if you can sit on your bitcoins for even just a week or so the payoff is huge!&nbsp; it&#039;s the only upside to having a vendor jerk your farcking leash and tie up your bitcoin in escrow

				I can&#039;t say why it rises so much, and then falls. But I can tell you that, to just a buyer on SR, it shouldn&#039;t make a difference. The prices for products change as the BC prices change, so we pay the same amount. unless of course you already have the BT in your wallet, but I try to avoid that as much as possible!
