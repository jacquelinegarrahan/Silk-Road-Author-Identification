				I can&#039;t post this on drug safety on account of my posts, but I guess it&#039;s more relevant to new users anyway. Please, please think long and hard about the doses you are taking with the drugs available. <br /><br />Two nights ago, me and 4 other friends each had 2 tabs of Tyl3r&#039;s 1.2mg NBOMe blotters each. 4 of us were fairly use to the effects, one had never done it before and insisted that he had the same amount. This guy is incredibly healthy and sensible most of the time, everything was going well when he started repeating, &quot;I need to jump! I need to jump!&quot; He started running down the street (he was a representative track runner, had no chance of catching him but tried). <br /><br />He started jumping people&#039;s fences, on one of them he miscalculated the jump and hit his head on the side of the pool. We&#039;re burying him in a few days. The tabs themselves are chemically safe, but I&#039;ll say again, think very long and hard about the doses you are using. I lost a friend of 13 years because of a stupid mistake that could have easily been avoided, and even though I&#039;ll never know any of you as well, I care about you all the same. Please stay safe.

				I&#039;ve noticed psych and benzo users often have a false sense of security when it comes to the safety of their drugs because the LD50 is so high. However, people need to keep in mind that the risks associated with drugs are not limited to their immediate health effects, but also include psychological effects that could destroy any semblance of discretion or rational thinking.

				I&#039;ve never had problems with benzos. I&#039;ve taken up to 1g of diazepam at once and I&#039;m tiny.<br /><br />I&#039;m so sorry to hear about your friend, though. Good grief.... :(

				My heart goes out to you :(<br /><br />I seem to be reading lots of stories lately about people freaking out on the NBOMe series. It seems to simply be too powerful for even some experienced psych users to handle, and the fact that it&#039;s frequently being sold as LSD isn&#039;t helping anything either.
