				let me qualify that concept...<br />Piezo is a transducer with the ability to turn pressure into electricity and vice versa so pressure exerted on the crystals at the perimeter of the cluster produce an electrical charge which causes the nearest crystal to exert a pressure on the next producing an electrical charge and so on in a cascade...

				now it strikes me that the interface is type matched to the external stimulus i.e. a photon emitted hologram<br />perhaps the Matrix has us all in it&#039;s clutches, perhaps nn-dmt has the ability to de-calcify your pinneal gland<br />allowing you to perceive a more realistic perception of this reality...?

				Is it a more realistic perception to understand your soul in this vessel is connected to your super soul which like God has the ability to expand itself but unlike God it does it in a limited way, hence your super-soul is running a program like a server daemon serving the needs of it&#039;s expansions or souls trapped in the material universe...

				something else that I perceive about dmt, that people that have written about is the machine elves...it&#039;s a simple fact that loading yourself into &gt;=50mg dmt hit is a lot like being fired into hyperspace. Whilst it&#039;s inevitable you will resist the flight mechanism, at the same time understanding you cannot, this can produce for some people visual humanized externalizations of themselves as they seek to control the uncontrollable which provide the necessary diversions whilst time inevitably passes and the production of mono amino oxidase - the chemical responsible for the destruction of excess neurotransmitter&#039;s - stabilizes the subject
