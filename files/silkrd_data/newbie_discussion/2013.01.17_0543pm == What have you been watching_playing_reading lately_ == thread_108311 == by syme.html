				Never really got into 24, but I&#039;ve managed to get through The Wire, Breaking Bad and Farscape over the last few months. Starting on the X Files and Battle Star Galactica now. BSG is slow going though, it&#039;s even more depressing than The Wire and Breaking Bad, I keep having to break off and go look at gifs of kitten or something for an hour.

				Good idea to make something (slightly :) ) more usefull out of this! <br /><br />I can recommend the movie Limitless (2011). Sort of an advertisement for using drugs in my opinion, but apart from that also just a good movie. <br />More movie tips anyone?
