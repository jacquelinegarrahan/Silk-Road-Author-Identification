				I know its late and&nbsp; I really don&#039;t have time to be here like I would like to.&nbsp; Some people think its kool some people think its not.&nbsp; But sorry if somebody offended somedody on these forums, by just talkng, and essure who evers on these forums, we as SR care about this community and the people on it. So please if you don&#039;t like whats going on, like some people talking something, please report it to SR support and we will look at every case by case.&nbsp; SR is a new SR now. Thank you and to all be safe.&nbsp; I know people think this could be fake, maybe SR wants you to think this fake and is fake,but could be true an is true.&nbsp; I have to say that because thats what I&#039;ve been told to say. Could this all be a myth. You decide, I decided along time ago.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do drugs because I choose not because not that I disapprove, just because I have health issues.&nbsp; So I&#039;m always working with a clear mind.&nbsp; Just thought to share with the SR community that thought.&nbsp; But if you do drugs thats fine too enjoy, wish I can enjoy but as I said before.&nbsp; I&#039;m making these speech now because I will not be making speeches any more, Mods are to take care off the forums.&nbsp; So Last thing youj will ever here from me is SR is a myth.&nbsp; I&#039;m a myth.
