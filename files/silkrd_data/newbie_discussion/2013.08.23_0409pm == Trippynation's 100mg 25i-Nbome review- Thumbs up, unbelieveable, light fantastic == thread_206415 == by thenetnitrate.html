				&nbsp;;D&nbsp; &nbsp;100mg 25i-Nbome - FEEDBACK&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D<br /><br />WOOOOW!!!<br /><br />This sample was excellent indeed. Ill be honest this made me trip and my mates trip our gonads off and this was both on small and high doses (tolerance dependent). I loved it and was the best 25i batch Ive had powder or blotter wise. i would advise investing in this vendors product it&#039;s good shit oh and&nbsp; If you are doing this for the first time a scale that can measure 1Mg is a good idea. i was doing this by eye which is stupid. But I&#039;m a professional idiot and been doing this type of stuff for years. it does dry your body out so keep hydrated. My mate came round last night not an experienced tripper and i tell you this guy was tripping like fuck,Loving it he ws in a happy place&nbsp; he kept saying he had wisp of hair on his face it was raining on him colours and trails distortions he was loving it but was also a little bit out of control but did have a good amount for a first timer lol. so was quite amusing to maintain while tripping myself ha ha. so be careful who you give it too and how much you need to be accurate. I loved it and would buy again this is something i will have on hand. oh if you keep using it you will gain a tolerance to it so once a week should be fine if you want your moneys worth. obviously its not acid but i would say it&#039;s a good starting place for chemical trippers who are not sure of acid. but remember always scene and setting is a must and frame of mind.its a beautiful day with the right things in place If the quality is like this people YOUR IN FOR A REAL TREAT!!<br /><br />Love it Like it ....&nbsp; &nbsp;...taste the rainbow Ha Ha!!!<br /><br />NN <br /><br />;D
