				Hello fellow noobs, buyers, and sellers.&nbsp; Been browsing the forums for a few weeks now.&nbsp; Have done a ton of reading on these forums about all the safety precautions to take and these forums have really helped answer most of my questions already.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m getting more confident in knowing the operations around here with how stuff works.&nbsp; Nightcrawler answered my last few questions on GPG http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96799.msg686510#msg686510 and I am getting close to making a few purchases.<br /><br />I could use a few suggestions on buying bitcoins.&nbsp; Bitinstant seemed the easiest cause I&#039;m looking for cash deposits.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen Bitfloor but I&#039;m 100 miles away from the nearest BoA branch.&nbsp; If there are any other domestic US choices for cash deposits or any other alternatives, I&#039;d like to hear them.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m mostly looking for small trial run purchases.&nbsp; &nbsp;1g cannabis and 1g BHO sellers might see me making purchases soon.&nbsp; Is there much resistance for first time buyers?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a few people mention needing a few purchases under their belt.&nbsp; Anyway, I thought I&#039;d introduce myself here before making a purchase.&nbsp; I hope to learn from my purchases over the next several months to gain knowledge to try to become a seller of Cannabis.

				Bitinstant, Bitcopia, and some of the sellers here on SR are all reliable methods to obtain your coins.<br /><br />To answer your question, newbie buyer resistance is generally done in a case by case basis. Some won&#039;t deal with new buyers, some will send you bulk products. All depends on your attitude with a vendor really. Start small, work your way up if you intend on purchasing in bulk. Always use the escrow system in the future, it&#039;s only there to protect you. Aside from that, build a good reputation and buyer stats. finalize promptly, leave quality reviews, and understand how SR works and everything along with it.<br /><br />Welcome to the road.

				How does one find a vendor who sells coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d rather get from the community rather than the industry but reliability is key.&nbsp; Is anybody reputable and consistent adverting around here?

				@Sauce<br /><br />Yeah, thought about that too the past few weeks. There exist some threads about decent and trustworthy sellers...but the paradoxon is, that everything related to buying bitcoins in here...is outside of the escrow system. Most people in exchange want WesternUnion, OkayPay and stuff like that...with none of the given methods( including SEPA transfers in Europe or else on the other side of the hemisphere) there is any security. Since even here there are some black sheeps, it is a hard decision to either TRUST somebody, like you would trust yourself...or run over giving money to the corps...which would from my point of view definitely be against the philosophy of bitcoin...what a dilemma :) Have you already found someone you would recommend?

I really like the bank deposit system tho these SR coin vendors think they are the tax man on my drugs... ugh

				My first order was an ounce from a trusted seller.&nbsp; I had no other transactions and he didn&#039;t require me to finalize early (I did it anyways).<br /><br />I would say that means there are definitely people who don&#039;t care if you&#039;re new.<br /><br />His name was &quot;supercanna&quot;.

				Start with a few small orders and go there.<br /><br />You&#039;d be silly to purchase a shit ton of drugs on your order.<br /><br />Get comfortable with SR and vendors before you start going all the way.<br /><br />As I say, spend what you are willing to lose.

				I just recently made a purchase of some MJ from NorCalKing, it was my first purchase on SR and NCK was a good vendor to deal with. The package got here in about 4 days (coast to coast) and the weed was under about 5 layers of packaging, absolutely no smell when it was received in the mail, but as soon as I opened it the glorious scent was released. NCK is a little pricey compared to other vendors but you pay extra for better service and product which is fine by me.<br /><br />As for getting Bitcoins, I just wire money from a bank account I set up to Coinbase. It does take a week from the time you order the BTC to the time they are able to be transferred to SR but i always plan ahead so waiting a week is no problem for me.
