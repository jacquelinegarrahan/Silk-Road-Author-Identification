				In the middle of what has been my worst experience on SR thus far with a vendor who beyond all logic is ranked in the 3% of sellers.&nbsp; :o <br />Been waiting for 20+ days for a LOCAL fucking order, and have been lied to every step of the way, originally being quoted 4-7 days and then after 10 being told it would be on my doorstep in no more than 2 and now we&#039;re in resolve, and I actually don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening. Truth is, I want the package far more than a refund of the nearly 2k I spent. Does merely being in resolve affect my stats poorly? What about reships? Will my stats go down because this asshole is unprofessional and doesn&#039;t give a shit about my time or his fucking job??? Have kept it civil on m,y end thus far, but will HAPPILY update post with a name depending on the outcome (whenever THAT MAY BE), because seriously, fuck this dude. Take it seriously or get off the fuckin&#039; road, man.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				No, simply taking an order to the resolution center will NOT negatively affect your stats.&nbsp; Stats would be affected only if it autofinalizes on you, or if you receive a refund through the resolution center.

				So if I ultimately need to get a refund (at this point it seems more and more like that will be the only option) will that automatically go against my stats, or if I get it a certain way, can that be avoided? It seems unfair that I should have a mark on my (granted, new) currently spotless history because this vendor is extremely unprofessional and bad at what he does. Is this just an unavoidable system flaw in an otherwise well thought out design?

				well i think if you win and get a refund it increases your refund rate which doesnt look too good but it shouldnt really effect your ability to purchase from other vendors.

				WHACK. Live and learn I guess&nbsp; :(. Got nine more days to wait, but not holding my breath. Would&#039;ve died trying long ago. If I wind up needing a refund, I will be posting this dudes name all over this forum. I already look VERY foolish and flaky IRL&nbsp; :-[ :-[ :-[

				No it already is in resolve since 2 days ago, and I requested six day extension for one last chance. The resolve center though says it due in 9 days(???) but I&#039;m waiting no more than six and getting a refund.
