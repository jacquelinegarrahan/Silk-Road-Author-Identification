				Adderall is way overpriced on the silk road. I can buy it locally for 3 dollars for 20mg and 4 for 30mg. I know the answer is people are willing to buy it for that much, but not sure why. It&#039;s not worth the prices that are being charged.

				Have you considered selling those $3-$4 20&#039;s and 30&#039;s on silk road?

				I&#039;ve considered it but I don&#039;t have a good enough hookup as far as quantity is concerned. <br />Considered going and getting a prescription and setting up a vendor account though..

				I feel you, I tried it a few times and saw gains in ambition and focus but since I don&#039;t have the symptoms to legitimately get it I thought I&#039;d try to get them bulk through SR but the prices are outrageous.

				I have a feeling that many vendors are simply too far down in the supply chain to sell for low prices. Think of it this way - the vendor has to earn a fair profit while also paying for his source&#039;s profit, a profit for his source&#039;s source and, possibly, a profit for his source&#039;s source&#039;s source.<br /><br />In other words, some of the vendors here are pretty much at the level of people who buy drugs on the street. Maybe they bought 20mg for $3 but sell for $5 to allow themselves to turn a profit. Plus, you&#039;re paying for the risk the vendor is taking by sending drugs through the mail.<br /><br />As a buyer, you have to consider whether the higher price is worth the (arguably) lesser risk of buying on the street.

				Getting Adderall from a doc is a huge pain in the ass. Multiple tests, prolly start you off with shitty medication till you complain it doesn&#039;t work and move you up gradually and if you&#039;re lucky you get Adderall in the end. It sucks I had a connect that sold them to me at $3 per that is until he flaked off. Regardless the Adderall vendors here just gouge so I had to turn to meth. Come on, big difference between $3 and $20 fing dollars for a 20mg Adderall. Insane I tell you...
