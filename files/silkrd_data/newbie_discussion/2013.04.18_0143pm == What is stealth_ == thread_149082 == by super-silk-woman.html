				What is your opinion of stealth? Vendors all claim to ship with stealth but for security reasons they cant reveal how. I have seen some good work and I have been disappointed (scared) as well. In my opinion we pay a high price for what we get to ensure our safety. That is one of the reasons vendors give for their higher prices. So I expect that the stealth will justify the increased prices when I order. <br />Though I have had some vendors tell me that they arent going to put anything in there to hide it like a book or DVD case. I dont expect them to go out and buy something but for real stealth grab something thats laying around the house things that arent going to cost anything and will fit in the same box and be covered under the same shipping cost. <br /><br />Some of the bad stealth I have seen is: <br />5 sheets of newspaper folded up with the item inside in a plastic bag=$11 shipping.&nbsp; <br />2 Pieces of printer paper folded up and the item inside=$9 shipping. <br />One of the worst I have seen is a SMALL Priority mail box with the item filled almost to bursting with a paper towel around it=$14 shipping. <br />I have heard of worse like sending pill capsules with stuff in them in a envelope=free shipping for a new vendor. <br />I have seen free shipping if you FE and when you do you find out afterwards the free shipping option isnt Priority Mail like all the other options and there is no tracking number (not that I want the tracking number but it protects me too) and its sent snail mail so what did you save by FE? The vendor can now selective scam you or if something does happen there is no recourse at all. <br /><br />Im just tired of the cutting corners and the bad attitude of some NOT ALL of the vendors. Its like im not giving you anything extra because im at my limit here on what im going to make in profits. BS we pay more for shipping and the product. We expect good stealth. Stealth means it looks like something else upon inspection. Not its in a box with tissue on it or in an envelope with paper wrapped around it.<br />Bottom line ASK a vendor about their stealth before you order. Confirm how they are going to ship and look out for free shipping deals and FE deals that might not ship out the way you ASSUME they do.<br />What do YOU think?<br />What has been your experiences in stealth?<br />What do you feel should be adequate stealth for domestic and international shipping?<br />Professional vendors: What IS adequate stealth when shipping domestic and international?

				So far I the worst I have seen in one that you listed.. the two sheets of printer paper with a small zip baggie in the middle.. and actually.. the product was not even inside that paper anymore it had traveled to the far corner of the priority envelope .. I think shipping was around $10 for that.. The product it self was EPIC so I could only complain so much.. but I did say something about it.. <br /><br />I&#039;ll update this thread later as I have some stuff coming in..

				the worst I have seen was one with postcard inside (hard) and ziplock bag inside just moving around the letter and making noise like a saltshaker....<br /><br />but it did got here so no complaints,&nbsp; i dot believe that even the best stealth will not help anyone if the letter will actually be opened by LE.

				Microdotter I agree if LE wants in they get in and they find it but shouldnt stealth make it as hard as possible for LE to find/notice it in the first place? For what we pay couldnt they do SOMETHING that takes a little more effort? Like the one you mention. I agree that &quot;at least it got here&quot; works when you GET AWAY WITH IT but what if you didnt? What if LE let this one go by to get you on something bigger? Point is stealth should mean you dont know whats in there when you hold the package at the VERY least. With what we pay I think a package should be something that looks like something else or is hidden in a better fashion if you did open it.

				You are correct in your point of view of &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; , and i completely agree with that.<br /><br />but what im saying is&nbsp; -&nbsp; that its not the stealth of the inside package that causes LE to decide and open the package, usually some other stuff concerning the OUTSIDE of the pack - / smell / technology / intelligence / random check / something suspicious or whatever... and once opened game over,<br /><br />unless stealth is VERY creative,&nbsp; unfortunately i have yet to see something like that here...<br />but yeah, i agree in general. just wanted to point that out.

A folded piece of paper around the item still looks exactly like a letter, the times when postal workers will flag something is if the package specifically possesses qualities they&#039;ve been trained to spot. This thread is the best source of information on US LE drug detection even though it is quite outdated: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18904.0<br /><br />I have had items sent with very similar packaging and even my anti-drug housemates couldn&#039;t tell what it was (and if they had I would not have been happy).

I think some sort of disclaimer could be added to their ads saying if you want a higher level of stealth that it either costs more or is not available. Something. Customers should know if it is coming with the minimum (which I dont think is enough) which is just a sheet or two of paper wrapped around it or if it is truly stealth which is hidden in something or made to look like something other than what it is and &quot;looking like a letter&quot; is still a minimum.<br /><br />The price we pay for shipping should be close to what we get. If they want a handling charge which you know most do (if some of them could charge you a fee for looking at their ads and breathing they would charge it) thats is ok but paying $11+ bucks to get a letter wrapped in paper with a stamp?<br /><br />So it comes down to communication. Customers dont want to ask to much and vendors dont want to reveal too in messages much but if we could come up with maybe levels of stealth so that a vendor can say I offer level 2 of stealth which might be hidden in a book or something and level 1 could just be the letter deal.<br /><br />Customers need to be more specific and honest in their feedback in regards to stealth. Too many customers are afraid to leave less than a 5/5 for vendors for fear of being blacklisted or maybe its because they dont want to upset the vendor-after all the vendor does have their address (unless they deleted it like they SHOULD have after shipping). <br />Not just that but many vendors DEMAND 5/5 and if the customer is not happy about the stealth rather than leave less than a 5/5 the vendor may promise to send a bonus now or in a later order. Either way the truth doesnt get put down. <br /><br />You can still rate the vendor 5/5 but be honest about the stealth &quot;it could be improved&quot;&nbsp; thats not too bad. Then if a future customer sees that they can inquire as to if shipping methods have been improved thus making sure the vendor has changed their process and not just pacified the one customer.<br />Just to reiterate as ive said before this is not the case with every vendor. Many vendors are the opposite of everything I have said. Their stealth is impeccable and their shipping charges are fair and the communication is there giving you faith in your vendor and in SR.<br />These tend to be your top rated vendors. The ones listed under bestselling in categories. <br />Still never just assume anything. Like Benny Hill once said: &quot;To ASSUME makes and ASS out of U and ME&quot;<br />

				Here is what we are using for shipping.&nbsp; Its the NEW recommendation:<br /><br />ANTI-STATIC MBB bags:<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING:<br />http://www.extrapackaging.com/anti-static/barrier/<br /><br />They have six layers of materials, including a layer of metal to prevent static charges and punctures.&nbsp; It cannot rip, tear either.&nbsp; Its industrial and designed for electronics and sharp objects like screws and parts.&nbsp; Its great if your package ever opens up, - its totally tear proof.<br /><br />Its the best.&nbsp; Nothing gets through it AND its mirrored so you can&#039;t see inside without destroying it first.&nbsp; You need to use a knife or scisors to open it too.&nbsp; It can&#039;t opened with bare hands at all.&nbsp; Put an industrial sticky label on it and disguise it as a product.&nbsp; I won&#039;t say any more detail in public.&nbsp; But after this, it goes inside something else and appears like any other shipped product.<br /><br />There are currently over 600,000. products currently shipping through the postal system using this exact same packaging material.&nbsp; It blends in nicely.&nbsp; Its not food grade, or home made looking - its industrial ISO certified shit.&nbsp; Looks like it left a factory shrink wrap machine.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not invented by us.&nbsp; We simply followed the forum suggestions from the pros.&nbsp; Its been tested.<br /><br />I hope this inspires others to take the time to package properly.

				If it is US domestic then what matters is that it can&#039;t be smelled by a dog, that it won&#039;t come open and that it has the correct address/postage.&nbsp; They need a warrant to open domestic USPS shipments.&nbsp; From a practical perspective they only x-ray US mail if the already suspect something.<br /><br />Now, some people don&#039;t have secure drops and somebody else (eg family member) might open their packages.&nbsp; In those cases it might be important to those people that there is stealth where those people won&#039;t find the item.<br /><br />I agree with the OP.&nbsp; Ask the vendor beforehand.

				NICE!<br />Spoken like a professional. If a vendor just told me what you said I would feel GOOD about their stealth! You care about my safety and that is my number one concern. Before I am even worried about the item being of any quality I worry about stealth. Even more than I worry about getting ripped off. <br />If it gets caught I could get caught. Even if I dont get caught what good was getting a better quality product if it doesnt get to where its going? Stealth matters more to me than anything. The product could be the best but if it has poor stealth in shipping I will never order again. That vendor risked my freedom and I wont take that chance with them again.<br /><br />Remember if a vendor sends one customer bad stealth and it gets picked up and &quot;they&quot; have the ability to trace it back to its place of origin and upon reviewing those records &quot;they&quot; see that there was a few other shipments sent out by the same person or at the same time/place and then &quot;they&quot; get those shipments going to those other customers now and start working from there. <br />Maybe &quot;they&quot; catch your package because of bad stealth and see that other packages are set to ship to you at the same time (from other vendors) now &quot;they&quot; get those packages that had good stealth and maybe &quot;they&quot; trace those packages back.<br />It can be like a domino effect. So even though iI choose vendors with good stealth-a vendor who sent someone something with bad stealth could be traced back to me.<br />Something to consider.<br />Every package everytime needs to be at its best or they are all at risk

				I&#039;m not gonna describe the worst packaging I&#039;ve received (just because I don&#039;t think we should describe any packaging). What does concern me is when it isn&#039;t smell proofed or vacuum packed. This gives more risk regardless of the stealth and if it&#039;s just some powder in a zip lock bag then that could come open.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some truly excellent stealth too. Stuff where I open it and think &quot;huh...&quot; and then try to think back on what I&#039;ve ordered recently. The ones where it takes me a few minutes to find the goods. I&#039;ve had some that have made me smile too. The best stealths are the ones where the vendor actually buys something and sends you that, with the drugs as a hidden extra. Yes it costs money for the vendor to do it, but this should be factored into their shipping costs and it doesn&#039;t have to be something costly. The occasional lost package could cost you more than spending an extra 30 cents on every package.

				Well.. Got two more orders yesterday and today.. <br /><br />One, that really did not travel far , LOL, still funny to me.. Well it was in a MMB bag with a baggie in it.. and DAMN if I could not get that thing open..&nbsp; then it was just the mailing packaging.. I did email the seller as I noticed something that might make our local mail people think.. The package was mail in one city but the return addy on it was about 30miles away in another city.. Funny thing is.. that it traveled to that other city then back down to me.. I&#039;m about 4 miles if that from where it was posted.. Go figure.. <br /><br />The.. taped to a 3&quot;X5&quot; index card and just stuck in there and shipped.. I&#039;m thankful it was not crushed to death (pills in a blister) but at least you could not tell what it was.. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you a few things.. <br />It&#039;s the little things that stand out for the postal system ...<br /><br />Like for example, you Dont want to be in Atlanta (not where I am btw) posting a package that you have put a return address in Duluth on It&#039;s going to stand out.. I understand if you, being a seller , does not wish to have an address near or at where they are.. But have common sense.. If you live in Atlanta , drive your butt over to PeachTree or stone mountain and mail it from there with an address in that area as the return addy.. The post office sends mail through a machine that encodes the Zip codes and the offices of where mail is sent from.. That is how I know mine came from just down the road.. Postal people look at Zip codes all the time and when they start seeing something like that, a lot ,they are going to notice.. Most people are going to mail work related package near their work.. Personal package near their home.. Most of the time the return zip code is going to be the same if not right next to where it is being mailed from.. If you send out stuff from a zip code and have a return address that is far away Guess What ??? Some mail person is going to start to wonder and start looking for more like it.. it&#039;s a red flag.. I know postal workers.. I&#039;ve talked to them about what sort of stuff stands out.. <br /><br />Too much tape also is a bad thing.. They look for that.. <br /><br />Things that smell funny .... You car better off using some sort of MMB bag then trying to mask a smell.. <br /><br />Funny and off names of people and companies that just don&#039;t sound right.. or belong to movies or people in the public eye<br /><br />It in the venders best interests to ship things well.. If the buyers get busted then they loose sales.. If it happens too much a lot of people will leave the road and stop buying here.. <br /><br />***Sellers.. If you can&#039;t or wont take the time to package something properly then Don&#039;t sell that kind of item.. <br />&nbsp;Limit sounds, No SMELLS and you are great! <br /><br />Just ensure follow that and make sure the outer packaging draws no attention and you are golden <br /><br /><br />And I&#039;m sorry no amount of stealth in the word is going to hide something 100% if a LEO has already found interests in a package they are going to find what they are looking for.. Just saying. <br /><br />

If you can&#039;t or wont take the time to package something properly then Don&#039;t sell that kind of item.. <br />&nbsp;Limit sounds, No SMELLS and you are great! <br /><br />Just ensure follow that and make sure the outer packaging draws no attention and you are golden <br /><br /><br />And I&#039;m sorry no amount of stealth in the word is going to hide something 100% if a LEO has already found interests in a package they are going to find what they are looking for.. Just saying.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And they say girls cant do this. I agree with everything said. Maybe a section in the forums could be created called suggestions to vendors because a lot of good information is here. Well said.

Obviously it&#039;s good enough for delivery.<br /><br />But then again one might want stealthy packages because you share mailbox with familymembers etc or get things sent to your friends or workplace. Some domestic vendors (Sweden) have sent me packages looking 100% like the drug delivery it is. In theses cases you should of course discus this issue with your seller.

				Do you think it has to be hidden from YOU? As long as it clears customs,or gets there without being recognized as drugs, it&#039;s successful stealth. Some people complain too much, and seem to like making a game out of finding their drugs in the box. If you&#039;re trying to make it stealthy from someone you live with, Get&nbsp; a PO box, or turn 18 and move out.
