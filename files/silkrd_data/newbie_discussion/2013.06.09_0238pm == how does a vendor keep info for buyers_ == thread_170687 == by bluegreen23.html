				I don&#039;t mean addresses.&nbsp; 100% unequivocally NOT ADDRESSES<br /><br />By this I mean, as a vendor I would prefer to keep tracking #s to myself. I feel that it is a tool that is used as proof of mailing, proof of receiving and possible looking into delays IF AND WHEN there are delays. <br />I am not fond of the idea of simply handing it over without any need. I feel that a person who is tweaking might decide he/she needs to check every 5 minutes. This was brought up in another thread and it seemed the consensus was that providing a tracking # was not required, and could be giving if the vendor wished but also that the vendor better have one to avoid any &quot;it didn&#039;t arrive&quot; BS. <br /><br />So you send it off, you have your tracking #. all is well in the world. day 3 arrives and the package hasn&#039;t. but it should have. the buyer gets antsy and starts msging. You reply as soon as possible to assure the buyer you&#039;re here and available and want to make everything right in this persons world. you will be in touch shortly yadda yadda yadda. So... you think, &quot;well maybe it&#039;s a slight delay, maybe it&#039;s lost, maybe it&#039;s been delivered, maybe a lot of things. time to find out by punching in the good old tracking #&quot; oh but wait you pump out 10-50 orders a day and with not keeping any records you&#039;re really not sure which order belongs to this buyer.<br /><br />so how do you solve this problem?

				it would be if you had 1 order at a time.<br /><br />so I&#039;ll try to throw this at you another way. <br />you are selling xyz. you have 50 orders of xyz today. you have all orders ready to go. the proper amounts, the proper shipping, the stealth yadda yadda. you start going through the addresses. copy paste copy paste copy paste yadda yadda print. ship them all out. <br /><br />day 2, 25 people are happy yay. day 3, 15 people are happy yay. day 4, 5 are happy. day 5.. 3 more people give a sigh of relief and are 2 thumbs up. but theres still 2 packages out there. 2 sellers that are msging you asking &quot;yo what up with my shit it&#039;s been 5 days! this is bullshit!.&quot; you go &quot;damn, sorry for the delay I have no idea what happened, let me look into. Rest assured I am here and I&#039;m not disappearing.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />So you head down to starbucks and pop your laptop to start checking the tracking info. except wait. you&#039;ve been a good little seller and made sure that your place, and your computer are clean of anything that a buyer has ever sent you. so shit... how do you with your 50 tracking numbers try to find the 2 tracking numbers that correspond to the two late packages?

				I suggest keeping a usb, then having a word doc on it with the buyers S/R name tracking number and what they ordered. the usb drive can be easily snapped if needed to be and could keep them dated i guess
