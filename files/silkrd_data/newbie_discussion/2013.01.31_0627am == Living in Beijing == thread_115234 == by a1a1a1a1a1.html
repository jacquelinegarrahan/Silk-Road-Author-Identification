				Hi anons.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently living in Beijing, China. Yes, I know Tor is blocked here. I&#039;m using a VPN to connect to the Tor network.<br /><br />I&#039;m new to Slik Road, Tor and all of this shit and had some questions.<br /><br />1. Is there a way to meet up with a possible dealer here instead of having shit sent through mail? I don&#039;t want to deal with any sort of mail or Bitcoin.<br /><br />2. Are there vendors in China? Is there a way to just buy shit with a supplier? Or does anyone know anyone I can contact. I really don&#039;t want to purchase this shit online. I would much rather prefer a face-to-face transaction.

				Just take a trip to Thailand. I would not feel safe at all doing drugs in many asian nations, especially China and Japan. They will have no qualms about executing you, if they deem you a drug dealer and a danger to stability.

				please remember that meeting in person to do drugs trafficking in China can get you the death penalty, most likely getting shot by a firing squad.&nbsp; At least with mail, you have some plausible deniability.&nbsp; Also remember that the PRC executes over 5000 people every year (that we know about, because the exact number of people executed every year is a state secret), far more than all other people executed in all other countries of the world, combined.

This shit may sound scary, but drug trafficking here is more common than you guys think. Most dealers here are niggers and they sell in a place equivalent to fucking Times Square in New York City, a place called San Li Tun.<br /><br />Thing is, I really don&#039;t want to meet up with some fucking ass stranger, I would much rather plan it out.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived here long enough to know that to a foreigner, it seems like China is fucking 1984 and Big Brother is fucking watching. But let me tell you, no fucking laws or rules are reinforced. I could run over 10 people in my car in some random ass village and nothing will come to me.

				I was in Shanghai a couple years ago and if you need drugs you just go to the clubs and look for African Americans.&nbsp; They always have stuff, but it&#039;s horribly over-priced and not great quality...Well, at least for the C that I was trying to get..

				Thailand I found too be safer than expected on the subject of drug use, if you know what you are doing.<br />The islands, Tao especially, have a very relaxed vibe when it comes too drugs, Samui not as much.<br />If you visit Tao the easiest way too get a hold on weed, opium, yaba (ice) etc is too do a SSI or PADI course (scuba), look for a &quot;inhabitant&quot; (non-Thai) with &quot;I Like Weed&quot; written on his/her forehead, aka instructors, and get friendly with him/her. After a few days of bonding and diving, maybe in one of the bars at night after a few beers, pop the question and 9 out of 10 they will hook you up. If you have a bungalow that´s the perfect place too do you thing or scout the island with your rented moped too find a nice laid back place. There are also a couple of bars, not down by the &quot;main beach&quot; tho, that if you get their confidence the will turn into a Thai K-Mart of drugs. Spent a couple of weeks (I think) on Tao last year and it was wonderful&nbsp; :)<br /><br />But if you don´t want too spend time and money (SSI/PADI) and have no problem what so ever whit an overwhelming amount of filth, a constant smell of dead, decaying EVERYTHING, such extreme poverty it will make your stomach turn, begging children from the age of 3 which wont leave you alone (and actually can get pretty mean if you turn them down too hard, but don´t in any way give them anything, you will regret it)..... well this and much more.<br />If you can handle that, then Cambodia is the place for you! ;)<br /><br />Take a flight too Phnom Penh from Bangkok, Thailand (I found too be easiest), get a cab and head for Sihanoukville, around 3 hour drive and if you pay more than $60 you´v been f*cked!<br />Get a nice room, they are all &quot;cheap&quot; so it all depends on how &quot;cheap&quot; you can handle the room to be.<br />Well that´s the hard part....<br />Head down to the beach, Serendipity, and then just walk, the &quot;road&quot; along the bars, located along the entire beach, and you will have to walk about 50 yards before your first deal is in motion.<br />The bar staff will embed your ears with one sweet proposition after another, it´s up too you too decide where to shop.<br />It goes something like: <br />Staff: Do you want anything to eat? (menu: bla bla bla.... have in mind that they also have the &quot;Happy&quot; choice too accommodate every dish)<br />You: No thanks!<br />Staff: Drink? (drink list: bla bla bla.... a beer ranges from $0,50-2, a drink $1-3, a bucket (2-4 pints) $3-15.... if you spend $50 on booze your in the morgue)<br />You: No thanks!<br />Staff: Smoke?<br />You: What do you got?<br /><br />And this is not just one bar, it´s every bar along the beach, and some &quot;in town&quot;, especially the straight up &quot;drug bars&quot; (get on a scooter cab, $1, and ask for it).<br />You will get, depending on season and &quot;the right guy&quot;, 1g of ice between $50-150, they get it at $20-50 so negotiating a price should not be a problem.<br />#4, horse, sets you back $80-200 for 1gram, it´s f*cking strong so be careful.<br />Weed I only used as seasoning on my pizza, but the pizza cost $5-15 depending on how &quot;Happy&quot; I wanted it too be. <br /><br />So if you don´t wanna get executed in China (do they kill people for drug use?), cheated by the NAACP in Roppongi, Japan, with their shit gear, low weight and expensive (they also like too squeal on you and the penalties are harsh) then South East Asia is the place for you!<br />If you get the chance go to Myanmar (Burma), the borders are now open and well... do you need a better reason too visit the motherland of the whitest horse known to man, the &quot;we export over 1 billion yaba pills / year&quot;, the most golden country in the Golden Triangle? ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The one cop on the island is really friendly (once gave 50g weed as a birthday gift to a friend of mine) and will, if he does not know you, look away or you pay him a reasonable, not going to Thai jail reasonable, amount, from what I heard around 10-50 000 bath depending on what you got on you and/or what you have done. <br /><br />Phangan: The island sucks anyway but people go there for the infamous Full/Half/Black-Moon party&#039;s and needles to say: There´s allot of drugs on those occasions. <br />But there´s also a shit load of cops, both Thai and from abroad, and they are ruthless. Your &quot;bail&quot; will be in the +100K bath class, if you get caught by a &quot;nice&quot; Thai cop, but will get astronomic in size really fast if it´s a &quot;bad&quot; one and reaches impossible if it´s an &quot;intern&quot; from abroad.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Bangkok: Well it´s a big city, with allot of people and allot of cops. Of course you can get what ever you like but there you really have to be sure of what you are doing. <br />And the cops are not cheap either...<br /><br />Cambodia:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sihanoukville (it´s the same everywhere in Cambodia from my experience): Well you really don´t have to think about the &quot;getting caught with drugs&quot;-bit because the guy you buy, or the bar (obviously there can be occasions where you are being tricked but if your on your guards that wont occur) all of them either pay the cops to stay the fuck out, or the bar is owned by a cop´, or the one you by from is a cop / get his stuff from them. <br />As long as you don´t go around like a superhero showing of your stash the cops (if you find them) wont bother you, and even if they do the &quot;fine&quot; is something like $50-100 and it seldom reaches above $500 (that´s when you´v been up to no good for to long or to much).<br />It´s more important to keep pickpockets and thieves away, if you´r in a bar the staff helps out, and always keep away from the kids, the small ones.<br />The will steal shit and if you´r really unlucky/stupid you get one in your lap (if you let them play with your phone or what ever) a &quot;parent&quot; will see you &quot;touching and grabbing the child inappropriate&quot; and call the cops and you will have to pay your way out, it´s all a scam... always pay your way out, always!<br /><br /><br />Well be smart, if it´s to good to be true it always is, always check thing twice, if it does not look right walk away, don´t buy from &quot;pushers&quot; etc etc etc...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
