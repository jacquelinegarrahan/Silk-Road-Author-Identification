				I know the site is going through a hard time right now so I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a temporary glitch. But just to make sure, as I searched and found no other threads with this problem...<br /><br />I managed to get on just before and my account showed 0.00 BTC. I&#039;m positive I had at least 1 BTC as I made a large purchase last night and that is what remained.<br /><br />Is anyone else experiencing this problem or is it just me? Could simply be a minor server error but I can&#039;t seem to get back on to investigate.<br /><br />-Thanks

				I&#039;m only guessing since I can&#039;t sign on to verify but...<br /><br />Can you not look at your transaction history and see how much you originally transferred to your SR account and also see what you&#039;ve bought?

				The only thing you can do is look over your bitcoin wallet transactions and add them all up.If then you think you should still have funds in your SR account then contact support.If I were you I would change your wallet address too,just in case someones got hold of it.keep it somewhere secure too,like on a usb stick so no one can access it.

				I think I just figured it out. <br /><br />Today as I was trying to login using my android phone, I searched for the SR address via google. When I got to the login page it also had a PIN field. I figured it was a new thing, with all the hacking etc, so without even thinking I entered it.<br /><br />I totally just got scammed, lol. I think I had like 1.9BTC or something. <br /><br />Bye bye money :(

				Yeah there&#039;s a few scam sites going on lately. Just make sure you use the right SR URL and never give out your PIN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

				hell, if DPR himself started saying &quot;everyone has to use their pin every time to login&quot; i&#039;d walk away from the site. that&#039;s the ONLY way to protect your $ with randoms on the internet the way they are. $200 is not a lot of money to some people but to me that&#039;s like my phone bill for two people for a whole month or my electric bill for three months! i would love to have that kind of money gifted to me, it would make a HUGE difference in my life right now. it saddens me that there are so many scammers out there just trying to rip people off all day long. i had my fun with check fraud as a stupid kid, would NEVER even THINK about doing anything like that again. I&#039;ll stick to my one fake identity, thank you very much lol&nbsp; ::)
