				So basically my questions are:<br />1) Can I transfer BTC that I already have from my blockchain wallet to my SR wallet without being caught?<br />2) What is the best website to buy BTC from?<br />3) Is it safe to buy straight from an exchange site to my SR wallet?<br />4) Should I use tor or is clearnet just fine for either transaction?<br /><br />Sorry for the noob questions, just want to minimize my chances of being caught.<br /><br />

				Yes, there is a chance to get caught like that: in case SR is compromised and if you access blockchain.info through your regular IP address.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;d first route them through another wallet not 100% linked to your identity and/or IP address. That gives you atleast some plausible deniability. I suggest the regular bitcoin-QT client routed through TOR.<br /><br />You can use additional wallets (while switching TOR identities when sending between those), but that&#039;s probably overkill for a small time buyer.

				Keep in mind that SR has a built-in bitcoin tumbler to help increase anonymity.

				there is no ip trace in the bitcoin network.<br /><br />sr tumble the coin on differents wallet.<br /><br />wallet are anonymouse.<br /><br />if it&#039;s possible, it&#039;s really difficult, nearly impossible, to track down a btc from sr to a real person.

				So,&nbsp; since I have been on my blockchain wallet through clearnet, is it too late to send the BTC&#039;s ive accumulated in there to my SR wallet?<br /><br />Could I do this? Go on blockchain on a browser using tor, send my coins over to SR?<br /><br />Also, if I use an exchange site to buy coins, should I be using a tor browser?

				Sorry, I feel like I&#039;m being confusing,<br /><br />I have some coins in my blockchain wallet already. Is it safe to send those coins to my SR wallet? Should I use clearnet or tor for this?<br /><br />and<br /><br />is the following the proper way to get bitcoins?<br />1. Using a Tor-configurated browser, go on a site (like mtgox for example) and buy bitcoins<br />2. For the receiving wallet address, use the SR wallet<br /><br />

				you can get caught if somebody will stand behind your back and watch what are you doing. otherwise such probability is minimal

				Well if you already logged in the blockchain.info with your regular IP I would just do it on the clearweb. No need to &#039;incriminate&#039; yourself by logging in with a TOR IP that is already linked to your real account.<br /><br />If you want to do it again in the future I&#039;d advise a bitcoin-QT client (in an encrypted volume) routed through TOR.<br /><br />It&#039;s all very logical when you think of it. Best to keep the two completely separated (clear vs dark).

				I would think if their was an easy way to catch you doing this - I dont believe you would be the first they would go after, just my thoughts. <br /><br />Theirs a lot of bigger fish on this long road.<br /><br />Im very sure they have took&#039;in many precautions in this.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t get to worried unless your moving 100 bitcoins a day\<br /><br /><br />Just my opinion, Kursed
