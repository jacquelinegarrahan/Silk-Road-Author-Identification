				I&#039;d like a 2C-B sample, but my Silk Road account is negative four bucks because of what happened last night, so I can&#039;t order the sample even if it is free.<br /><br />Let me go see if someone can hook me up in the spare btc thread. Hopefully a sample will still be available.

				I was fortunate enough to be able to make an order for TFT&#039;s 2c-b before it disappeared.<br />I was more interested in trying 2c-i since it&#039;s new to me but the listing was gone when I checked.

				I cannot compare it to any other vendors on silk road, but I have had 2cb from a couple of sources prior to sr and HOLY FUCK YES this is some good stuff! 20mg rocked my world with love and sensual joy, and had me equally ready to fuck or cuddle or shoot the shit. Very gentle comedown after about 4-5 hours, and was able to sleep pretty restfully at about 6 hours.<br /><br />VERY courteous service, crazy fast shipping (7 days from EU &gt; midwest USA), EXCELLENT STEALTH (are you sure this is it?? Lol) product is 200mg overweight on a 10g order, and seems to be the purest 2cb I&#039;ve ever had. Cannot rave about this guy or his gear enough...<br /><br />I dub thee, &quot;TheMoreThanFairTrader!&quot; :D Do not hesitate guys, this is the real motherfuckin&#039; deal!!!!!

				Fucking incredible 2cb, and the package was very innocuous for international, with very good stealth. And super fast! I implore anyone on the fence to give TFT a try, I am pretty sure you won&#039;t be disappointed. Cannot say enough about my experience from beginning to end. And now I have a bunch of the best 2cb! Solid gold win. :)
