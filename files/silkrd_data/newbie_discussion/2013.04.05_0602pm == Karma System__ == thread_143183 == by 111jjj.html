				I&#039;m new so I&#039;m not sure, sometimes the search doesn&#039;t work for some reason so its hard to know if I&#039;ve searched thoroughly.&nbsp; From what I understand once you reach 100 posts you can start giving karma to people, good or bad, you just +1 or -1 them after they say something you agree with or disagree with respectively.&nbsp; For example you post something, someone else reply with something awful you reply back with something awful, then you get a ton of bad karma from the replyer and his friends, who are usually moderators.&nbsp; Basically if you don&#039;t want bad karma dont say anything that anyone might feel one way or another about...

				I dunno, I doubt I will take it seriously, seems like just a fun little thing to have in the forums.&nbsp; OO i dun like what you said, -1 for you! haha <br /><br />But I guess with vendors and stuff it can be good, if you have a vendor with a ton of bad karma, theres one warning flag right there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not that some bad karma is gunna stop taking a risk on a vendor with -20 karma...

				Yeah I can see it being useful for assessing reviews/vendor complaints and all that. And those people who like to make &#039;cops are at my door&#039; kinda posts. Though it should be quite easy to work out who the respectable posters are around here pretty quickly anyway. <br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine this works for everyone but I tend to take criticism a little too seriously (even over the internet) so I&#039;ll be trying extra hard to make sure all my posts are friendly and helpful :)
