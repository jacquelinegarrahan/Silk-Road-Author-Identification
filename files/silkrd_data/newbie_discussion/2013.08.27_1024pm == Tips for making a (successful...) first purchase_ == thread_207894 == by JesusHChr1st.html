				Try PMing the vendor to get a general feel for them,&nbsp; it&#039;s nice to get to know each other first.&nbsp; Ask as many questions as you want about the product, stealth etc and you&#039;ll get a feel for the vendor.&nbsp; I would recommend not FEing as it takes away your rights to dispute if things go wrong.&nbsp; Also research on the forums and go through all their reviews

				Look at the vendors posts on forums see how they conduct themselves , do they have fans who have&nbsp; a good few posts on their review threads , always a good sign and of course you got to go through their vendor profile works most of the time.<br />Look at the new discussion section on the road it is still new but it will come in handy to look at complainers.<br /><br />I had a vendor not read a message but I noticed he had not been online for 8 days ,I thought he had probably gone to get some summer sun so I never moaned at him he said his Dad had died so I took him at his word and as soon as he came back i got the package next day.I have been waiting 12 days for a new vendors product took a chance as it wasn&#039;t much money So I messaged him and was polite told him I would give him until end of the week to get it or would have to go into resolution as time was running out , but I always remained polite , lone behold it turns up today and his gear is the best of the three vendors I bought it from before , I was so high of it that i did not give a fuck and gave him 5/5 but put needs to sort delivery out , don&#039;t want to upset him I want more 2 weeks wait or not&nbsp; :D Don&#039;t know if they can just delete it without reading the message by the way still a noob hence I&#039;m locked in here.Done in $1200 though on here in 6 weeks though&nbsp; ;D

				I would also say do your research. Anytime I&#039;m considering purchasing from a vendor, I always come here first and do a search for their name. It&#039;s saved me a couple of times from buying from somebody who looked good but was called out here as being a scammer. It&#039;s not foolproof, of course, but it can save you a lot of headaches.

				Remember, news vendors are like new buyers - they get discriminated against. Good communication is the key to establishing trust, be prompt to reply to messages and finalising, let them know you&#039;re legit.

				I just went through my first purchase and i was lucky enough to have a couple vendors give me some surprising advise. If you&#039;re only ordering a small amount for personal use, its actually probably better to use yer real name. This whole thing is a dice roll, and NOTHING is 100% but the chances of a reputable vendor shipping you something domestically (yes right to your name) are pretty safe. Im sure theres a larger chance of getting drunk and peeing in public (i heard somewhere thats grounds for getting registered as a sex offender, why i bring it up, im not even sure). Using a fake name could cause your friendly neighborhood delivery man to become concerned that your package is simply heading to the wrong place. Think about it, logically they&#039;re more concerned about an incorrect shipment then whether or not you wanna get high. <br /><br />With that said, my first sentence was &quot;went through my first purchase&quot; so Ive also learned from these forums that makes me a qualified idiot (ok there that absolves me from any wrong doing) I just wish someone would have told me that before i freaked out about sending my real name. Oh, learn encryption when sending personal info as well, i know TOR&#039;s spose to protect you but it dont take much to screw that up for yourself if you get lazy with updates or internet add ons.&nbsp; Finally, it sounds like their a lot of paranoid buyers on here, and there&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but some of us like to get stoned and window shop so quit scarin us into thinking the FBI is outside! The far sadder truth is no one really gives a shit if you wanna get a little high, im not saying there is no risk because we are BUYING DRUGS FROM A WEBSITE, im just saying when you put it in perspective you&#039;ll probably be just fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;Ive done my research, and SR is the safest way to buy drugs, and pretending to be friends with your dealer is fucking hell.&nbsp; im assuming the first few buys are gonna be a little uneasy.....but remember yer first weed dealer??? I was convinced i was gonna get shot over a dime bag. So relax, and DO YOUR VENDOR research, ive figured out that stealth is key and vendor information is everywhere on these forums.

Learn to read the reviews.&nbsp; Lots of recent activity = good.&nbsp; Lots of recent FE&#039;s = bad.&nbsp; <br />2.) The better vendors will state their policies on their profile pages.&nbsp; Read them.&nbsp; Now read them again.<br />3.) Lots of fish in the sea - if something seems off, then go elsewhere.<br />4.) Small quantities a few times makes everyone more comfortable and most vendors seem to love getting return customers.<br />5.) Read the forums to keep up with who is doing well (and who isn&#039;t) - and be sure to post your own impressions.<br />6.) Keep SR and SR-forum ID&#039;s separate (...as I am doing)<br />7.) If the vendor can&#039;t be bothered to use PGP then be wary - particularly as the substances involved move up the, umm, sensitivity scale.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had very good luck so far.&nbsp; Establish yourself with the established names and your odds of happiness increase substantially.

				I have packages shipped to my house because the orders aren&#039;t large and if anyone says anything I can just say, &quot;I had no idea that drugs were being sent to me through mail.&quot; Then they can&#039;t say anything about it. Now, if they know there are drugs in the mail and they wait for you to receive it and then say they have a warrant to search or something like that and notice you opened the box, you&#039;re screwed. So wait about 2-3 before you open the box. <br /><br />Next, you shouldn&#039;t have any cancellations when you&#039;re ordering from anyone. Personally, my first order was about 3 grams of hash for like 30$ and that was from Spain. Worked great. My 2nd order was a 480$ order for 1.5oz of some really good weed and that wasn&#039;t cancelled and I got the package within a week. So as long as you don&#039;t do anything sketchy, as long as you dont try to go for refunds after you got the package, as long as you finalize when you get the package to release the funds to the vendors, then you should be pretty good to go.

				ok... if you control the mail at your address it is better to use your own name in this game unless you are going the &#039;friends safe house&#039; route<br /><br />#1 thing to look for a vendor is STEALTH<br /><br />i dont care if he is selling you rabbit turds as bunk, if it is smooth stealth there are no issues<br /><br />even if he triple charges some other rabbit turd seller, but has the best stealth, stick with the stealthy rabbit turds<br /><br />got it?&nbsp; that&#039;s how you stay on the road, you can just buy from someone else if you get tired of his rabbit turds<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
