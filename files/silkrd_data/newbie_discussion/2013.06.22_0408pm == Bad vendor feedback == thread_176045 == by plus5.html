				Title: <strong>Bad vendor feedback</strong><br />

				Hi - Just getting to grips with all the info here. Something I&#039;ve seen mentioned a few times is about the feedback system, and when someone needs to give bad feedback about a vendor. It seems if you get some bad product and want to give bad feedback, then the vendor can give you bad buyer feedback, which can stop you being able to buy from other vendors.<br />Can someone explain how this works please ? Doesn&#039;t this defeat the whole purpose of the feedback system.<br />TIA

				I&#039;m new here too. From what I understand, if a buyer get a bad product, they&#039;d give the vendor bad feedback, which will bring his reputation down. By doing so, the vendor would never sell to that buyer again, and probably would rant about it in the forum about this buyer leaving bad feedback. It would scare other vendors, and they would avoid selling to this buyer. It&#039;s a bad circle.

				The vendors allegedly maintain a buyer blacklist in the vendor forum, but how well-used it is or whether it&#039;s officially supported by the site admins is questionable. We buyers don&#039;t know much about it really but I suspect it isn&#039;t as big a deal as it&#039;s made out to be.<br /><br />If you are unsatisfied with the quality of service, it&#039;d be best to contact the seller first before leaving bad feedback. If you can&#039;t come to an agreement, take it to resolution. But avoid getting into that situation in the first place by only buying from good sellers.<br /><br />For any popular item, you can easily avoid being sent bad stuff. Just read feedback on these here forums. I have been here for a very long time and have never, not even once, done a deal that was not perfect.

				Vendors can&#039;t leave you any feedback currently, good or bad. Some vendors do say if you give less than 5 they will not sell to you again. I&#039;m sure some vendors do share a &#039;do not deal with list&#039; but I doubt all vendors participate.<br /><br />I think it is wrong to leave bad feedback for a vendor without contacting the vendor first to explain the situation. Yes they may not do anything about it and then the bad feedback would be warranted. If you&#039;re using your real name and address I would be hesitant to get into too much of a heated argument with a vendor; nothing good can come of it.

Avoid that situation by only using excellent vendors. And always remember you are buying drugs here kids. Doing this comes with a risk of being ripped off.

				Don&#039;t get yourself on the buyer blacklist.&nbsp; If you need to leave negative feedback, make sure it&#039;s legit.&nbsp;
