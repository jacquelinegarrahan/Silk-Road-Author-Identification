				So... apparently it&#039;s not standard procedure, but I&#039;m new to SR so a day after I placed my first order I sent the (HIGHLY, HIGHLY rated) vendor a message saying I had never ordered before... ignore this message if I did everything right but let me know if I did anything wrong... that was it. He waited two more days and cancelled my order for sending him a message. For God&#039;s sake, I said ignore the damn thing if I did everything right. Fucking lame.

				Lol&nbsp; :) some people r funny! Make sure u read the vendors page it tells u everything u need to know about them, some don,t take new buyers and state on their page that if ur new and u order they will not refund!! So i,d just make sure u read the full page it,ll save you time and maybe money&nbsp; :)

				It didn&#039;t have anything to do with being new... I guess he just didn&#039;t want messages. I encrypted it and made it clear I didn&#039;t need a response if I did everything right. Damn, though... what an asshole. If I didn&#039;t do anything wrong all he had to do was not respond and we were cool.

				Hah, you caught me. No, I didn&#039;t encrypt my address when I first ordered. That&#039;s why I sent the message asking if there was anything I should change or if everything was okay... but I didn&#039;t mention that detail specifically... and when I sent the message I DID encrypt it. I just didn&#039;t know and I was trying to do it the right way. The response was a diatribe about how he didn&#039;t have time to receive messages and it had only been two days when I sent it, that was nothing and my order was cancelled. I was fuming. I wanna get high, dammit!

				Personally I don&#039;t think you did anything wrong by sending a message but from the vendors point of view, getting an unencrypted address and then an encrypted message, it&#039;s the opposite of what it should have been.<br /><br />Always encrypt things with sensitive info like names address etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if your places and order, if your puting a name or address encrypt it.&nbsp; Messages that are just like &quot;hey my order&quot; or &quot;could you tell me this&quot;, normally they don&#039;t want that encrypted.<br />

				Hey gang!<br /><br />I wanted to quickly ask for some general feedback on a recent purchase:<br /><br />Through another vendor&#039;s endorsement, I placed an order on SR with a vendor.&nbsp; It was my second time.&nbsp; The first order went considerably well and sort of set the bar nice and high (lol).&nbsp; However, this second order is awful by comparison.&nbsp; Envelope had a huge bump in the middle, no reply on emails for 2 days, and now product is dry and surrounded by shake.&nbsp; Although there are some nice smells the majority of it smells like hay.&nbsp; Other than chalking it up to a learning experience, which I will, should I approach the vendor about the situation?&nbsp; If anything, I feel he may be putting others at risk by drawing attention.&nbsp; Also, because of the quality received should I ask (politely) for any portion of BTC back?&nbsp; Should I just finalize, leave honest feedback and score, and then walk off into the sunset?&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re curious to hear your thoughts&nbsp; <br /><br />Call us on the hotline&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				I completely agree with you about being constructive.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only way someone can improve.&nbsp; I myself performed a great deal of research before making any orders.&nbsp; With this vendor&#039;s profile, he mentions things like &quot;luxury&quot; and &quot;top shelf&quot; along with &quot;professional customer service.&quot;&nbsp; So while it is in hand, I think this only accounts for a small portion of the overall transaction and therefore the overall rating.<br /><br />When I leave feedback I do so in a way that that helps other potential buyers with similar tastes gather appropriate information; the same information I would look for when researching vendors. <br /><br />While researching vendors, I personally never spent much time reading the 5/5 rankings.&nbsp; With the exception of the lengthier ones, the 5/5 generally seem to be lack detail and are very homogenous.&nbsp; Instead I look for the lower ranked reviews.&nbsp; To me, this paints a much better idea of what I might be getting into or what someone can expect on a bad day.&nbsp; It also helps give perspective to that particular vendor. <br /><br />With that said, I want to give a feedback ranking that will help&nbsp; other potential buyers make their best decision.&nbsp; This should include the how the item appeared when it was shipped, the level of communication, and of course the quality of the product itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />My rational is this-- if I finalize promptly, give a ranking of under 5/5 and explain why; wouldn&#039;t that be fair?&nbsp; And at the same time it would make room for better OVERALL vendors to thrive on the SRd who actually deserve the 5/5 (we know who they are :P)<br /><br />I&#039;m curious on your thoughts<br /><br />Pardon all typos****

				@Sasscroch leave feedback you would have wanted to read before you ordered i don,t think its bad too be honest but fair i don,t think a vendor deserves a 5/5 if you were not happy with the product its not fair to other buyers reading the feedback i always think if its 5/5 it must have been ok. I,m in the same boat with a vendor just now and i,m not going to FE untill they sort something out i,ve ordered weed i ordered last week and its completely different (as in shit) only ordered a g last week, nice stuff, ordered 3.5g this week and its shit, FUCK THAT&nbsp; &gt;:(
