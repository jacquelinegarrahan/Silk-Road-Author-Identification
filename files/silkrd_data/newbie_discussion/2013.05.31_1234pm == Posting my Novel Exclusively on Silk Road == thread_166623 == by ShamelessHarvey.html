				Greetings fellow Silk Roaders,<br /><br />So I recently just made the decision to release my new novel exclusively on Silk Road. It&#039;s called &quot;Dabbling in Suicide&quot; you can find it on SR. My vendor name is the same as my forum name.<br /><br />As most of you were tired of the established markets, I&#039;m tired of the established publishing industry. No matter how much they wanted me to be apart of it. Benefiting from a broken system doesn&#039;t make the system less fucked.<br /><br />So I&#039;m releasing my book on SR. <br /><br />For free. I&#039;m adding a few chapters at a time, periodically. So keep checking back.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the prologue...<br /><br />DABBLING IN SUICIDE<br /><br />-Seamus Harvey<br /><br />DECEMBER<br /><br />PROLOGUE<br /><br />People pay good money to hallucinate.<br /><br />Suckers, all of them.<br /><br />There is no greater hallucinatory experience you can unleash upon yourself then simply staying awake for four days straight. You find people who commonly claim to have been up for days upon end without sleeping. They&#039;re called liars. What they mean is they were working on a project or paper of some weight, and have been getting ALMOST no sleep.<br /><br />That won&#039;t do for these purposes.<br /><br />No nodding off, no power napping under the desk, no quick winks while standing in the shower.<br /><br />Awake, absorbing glorious input, longer than 96 hours.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot harder to accomplish than it sounds. Your body will want to shut off.<br /><br />Fuck your body. It&#039;s a coward.<br /><br />When willpower is failing, pharmacology will be your savior.<br /><br />I find that methamphetamine is the best hack for bypassing this silly self preservation routine the body tries to pull on you. Preferably smoked from a glass pipe. And don&#039;t be trashy. Don&#039;t smoke from some carbon encrusted glass dick that they find on dead tweekers after the warehouse rave got raided. Be classy. Take care of your pipe.<br /><br />Love your pipe.<br /><br />Never let the flame touch the glass. Thats where that black charcoal bowl crust comes from. Keep the tip of the flame a good inch away from the bowl. Patience. You are baking a souffle not caramelizing creme brulee. The goal is to slowly let the crystal melt in the glass. You actually want to inhale pure, beautiful vapors not smoke. If your shit is smoking you are doing it wrong, dirtying your pretty bowl an wasting drugs.<br /><br />Your mom taught you better.<br /><br />Practice until you get it perfect. You will feel the difference.<br /><br />Now once you&#039;ve mastered your new found superpower you can use it to fight off any amount of sleep craving your body can throw at you. And now, well armed, you can take the governor off your waking hours and zoom down the road to the sacred world beyond the 96th hour.<br /><br />There&#039;s a different planet past that point. I&#039;m a regular vacationer there. I&#039;ve even lingered into my 5th and 6th day. Like music to the deaf, I&#039;m not going to attempt to explain it. But I encourage everyone to try it, at least once. Turn your world on its side. If you find you like it there a bit, stay awhile and play. At the very least it will expand your perception.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t encourage is packing up your hooker girlfriend and BEGINNING a 21 hour road trip to New Orleans when you haven&#039;t slept a blink in 5 days.<br /><br /><br /><br />
