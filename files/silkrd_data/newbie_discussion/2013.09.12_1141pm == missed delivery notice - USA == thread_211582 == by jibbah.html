				I&#039;ve only made a few orders from SR so I don&#039;t know how out of the norm this is.

In fact, my postman knocks once then starts writing the card out while he&#039;s waiting. He&#039;s usually posting it through the letterbox by the time I&#039;ve got to the door.<br /><br />I&#039;d say go collect it - it&#039;s not like the delivery guy asking you to sign, it sounds (to me) like just standard post office procedure. It would be a shame to have your goods sat in some PO depot going stale, wouldn&#039;t it?<br /><br />On the other hand, I can&#039;t speak from a specifically drug/sr perspective, so perhaps wait until somebody who HAS experienced this replies.

				90% of me thinks its ok, no big deal. Especially since it didn&#039;t say I have to be the one proving my identity and picking it up. <br /><br />However, never have I received a &quot;sorry we missed you notice&quot; when I&#039;ve ordered express or priority. Only time I&#039;ve received such a thing is if the sender requested something like that. However, I&#039;ve previously dealt with this vendor and have not had that experience.<br /><br />It could be a new mail guy covering this day and he&#039;s just being cautious? I dunno. My apt mailbox is decently sized (like a 1 qt jug of milk size) so it should hold it. However, maybe the vendor made the packing a little puffy or beefier than usual. <br /><br />If it were a CD, I&#039;d think that it would not happen at the PO. Nor would I think theyd have a cop waiting around all day everyday until I decided to come in and pick up my package. Seems a waste of LEO resources.<br />

				I&#039;ve had this happen to me. It was a new vendor and he didn&#039;t realize that he had to waive the signature requirement, otherwise the postman would have just left the package. I was kinda worried about it and after about 5 days I finally worked up the balls to just march in there and get it. I didn&#039;t want to lose the $400+ and I really wanted my product. Turned out I was nervous for nothing, I went in and picked up my package like nothing.&nbsp; I&#039;d just go right in and get it if I were you.
