In most major US cities, you can re-sell that for $75-$100/gram. Go for the PMK / White stuff, advertized as &quot;84%&quot; ... it will shit on anything locally. I recommend Old Amsterdam.<br /><br />Weed:<br /><br />Did you know that you can buy Lbs of the very best weed money can buy for $3,000 - $3,500 ? Takes 2-3 days coast-to-coast, and most places you will find your competition is lacking.&nbsp; People are paying $325-$350 for an ounce of shitty outdoor, and the &#039;competition&#039; who are selling the good stuff seem to be &#039;firm&#039; on their $400/ounce+ prices.<br /><br />@ just $300 an ounce, you&#039;re making $1200-$1800 profit on 1 Lb!&nbsp; You could sell that in a day, couldn&#039;t you?! <br /><br />There&#039;s just so much money to be made, and now that you&#039;re here.... I want to welcome you to the best connect you ever had. The Silk Road!&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t stop there... once you save up enough money, you can move to Amsterdam, or Cali and become a vendor yourself!! THINK ABOUT IT MAN!<br /><br />One day... perhaps even YOU could become, The Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anything is possible.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />+1 to all those with good drug-related stories, or deal-gone-bad type stories! :D

				but what happens when you get you&#039;re 100grams of MD, you can&#039;t sell it.

I usually make more than that cause I do have a lot of close friends who will buy zips for $300. <br /><br />With MDMA, your profit margins are 500%.&nbsp; That&#039;s hard to argue against, when those prices are in plain site.&nbsp; Old Amsterdam charges $9600 for 500 grams of PMK White.&nbsp; It shits on everyone else&#039;s molly around 2 major cities in the NE United States where I distribute it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even whole sale, we don&#039;t see less than $75 per gram.&nbsp; Which if you cannot add, is $37,500.&nbsp; Not bad for an investment of less than $10k. This is a bi-weekly affair, OldA&#039;s Express ship takes about 5-9 days on average; it&#039;s a quick turn around.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sorry friend, but the only thing the &quot;Mexican Mafia&quot; might be upset about when it comes to my friends and I, is losing all those sales when we all graduated the 8th grade and stopped smoking dirt! LOL<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has anyone watched &quot;How To Make Money Selling Drugs?&quot;, it&#039;s pretty funny, and somewhat informative. But it&#039;s also not why I posted this, lol Bruce I just saw your comment.<br /><br />Anyway, I suppose I am making this sound easier than it is because it&#039;s second nature to me, as I have been selling Cannabis and Shard for a decade.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m trying to get some newbies pumped!&nbsp; Think about all the Forbes readers who are going to flock to these forums like half the people posting in this thread did when Gawker discovered SR last year!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THEYRE GONNA WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET DA LOOTZ!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				My point was that it is not as easy as just selling drugs, and it also takes a ton of time to build up a business along with the constant risk if you are moving so much per week.&nbsp; Of course the numbers will crunch out, but they make up about 1/5 of what actual drug dealing is.&nbsp; 1/10 if you really want to run a business :/&nbsp; <br /><br />It is all possible, but i&#039;m sure that people would be better off starting with a smaller denomination to experiment selling with.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking cannabis here though.<br /><br />Btw selling MDMA sounds very nice,&nbsp; I should look into getting some ^.^

				Yeah, I may or may not plan to go into selling weed and phenethylamine derivatives on a larger scale than I have tried before, at some point. It&#039;s just getting the start up cash stashed and acquiring an alternate delivery address that are slowing me down at the moment.

				Of course there are always opportunities to make the middleman activity into a profitable career as OP says.&nbsp; <br /><br />But -- There are costs and risks commensurate with the reality of your making 10 grand a week, such as a safe location that won&#039;t get jacked by the gangs, laundering your profits and having a cover story for the tax man, having to get others involved who can fuck you up (especially if you have no control over a &quot;friend of a friend&quot;), dealing with poor product quality, scamming and lying customers, etc. You will start small and learn the ropes, before you get to 10 grand. Make a business plan in writing how you get from point A to point B,&nbsp; and realistically assess the risk of whether you can resist falling too deeply into your own products, as many weak-willed vendors get hooked or messed up on their own dope.<br /><br />This is where I would say there&#039;s an even better and safer way to be an empire-builder in drug vending. What do I mean?<br /><br />What I&#039;m talking about is that you have something that YOU originate and source yourself, such as you grow your own cannabis or shrooms. Here&#039;s a few benefits of this supply chain simplification, namely: you reduce the sourcing risks; you know and/or control the quality of the product; which makes it easier to adjust the retail price as needed; and you reduce the legal risks.<br /><br />This method of commerce can be run with less risk of discovery than receiving large amounts of hard chemical meds from up the food chain. That step is eliminated when you grow your own THC medicine or therapeutic psychedelics, both items basically harmless organic matter incapable of killing anyone by overdose. <br /><br />Selling small amounts to many customers is much better than the other way around from both a price and a legal standpoint. Do you want to get popped selling ozs of powder/pills and lbs of weed? It&#039;s easy to do it by mail in small amounts at highest retail markup. <br /><br />The world will always need those major players. Only thing is, these majors are run through cartels and gang/clan alliances. Their advantage is the connections they have in their far flung networks. They are run just like a major corporation, it&#039;s all about the bottom line. They buy off the cops to avoid supply chain interruptions. They scare off their competitors. It&#039;s a dog eat dog world, not for dummies or the risk adverse. Only a small percentage will make it to 10K per week and maintain it for a year. Lazy vendors who would rather get high than get rich are in the majority.<br /><br />There are ways to win a big number of regular and loyal customers, by using the best marketing ideas, coupled with technological innovations.&nbsp; The same formula as Apple uses to sell iphones and ipads, by manipulating your reality, implanting images. I have no doubt there are innovations in drug vending,&nbsp; technologically feasible right now, that would make a savvy SR vendor look like Steve Jobs or Richard Branson caliber, far beyond the rest of the crowd. Who is going to be the successful innovator?<br /><br />The OP made a catchy subject line for this thread. Here&#039;s what it really means. There is nothing that is too good to be true. 10 thousand a week is only a number. If you want 30 thousand a week, or whatever, it&#039;s possible, too. It&#039;s all relative. Many people would not be satisfied with &quot;only&quot; 10K a week, such as subscribers to Forbes magazine.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s much easier to make your money legally, then you can spend it getting as wasted as you want to, without worries.<br /><br />OK. Any questions? Class dismissed.&nbsp; ;- )--~<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Make sure you research vendors well enough to obtain (to the best of your ability) a pretty good knowledge about their stealths (i.e. going through pages of feedback and reading comments regarding stealth, not necessarily quality of product). Most of the bulk RC vendors get their products dropshipped and all have about the same quality. Stealth that&#039;s like night and day between some vendors. It is basically in the hands Chinese underground labs. I&#039;ve been to a few, and to be frank, I don&#039;t see how it makes it though anyone&#039;s customs.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Judge<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

What do I mean?<br /><br />What I&#039;m talking about is that you have something that YOU originate and source yourself, such as you grow your own cannabis or shrooms. Here&#039;s a few benefits of this supply chain simplification, namely: you reduce the sourcing risks; you know and/or control the quality of the product; which makes it easier to adjust the retail price as needed; and you reduce the legal risks.<br /><br />This method of commerce can be run with less risk of discovery than receiving large amounts of hard chemical meds from up the food chain. That step is eliminated when you grow your own THC medicine or therapeutic psychedelics, both items basically harmless organic matter incapable of killing anyone by overdose. <br /><br />Selling small amounts to many customers is much better than the other way around from both a price and a legal standpoint. Do you want to get popped selling ozs of powder/pills and lbs of weed? It&#039;s easy to do it by mail in small amounts at highest retail markup. <br /><br />The world will always need those major players. Only thing is, these majors are run through cartels and gang/clan alliances. Their advantage is the connections they have in their far flung networks. They are run just like a major corporation, it&#039;s all about the bottom line. They buy off the cops to avoid supply chain interruptions. They scare off their competitors. It&#039;s a dog eat dog world, not for dummies or the risk adverse. Only a small percentage will make it to 10K per week and maintain it for a year. Lazy vendors who would rather get high than get rich are in the majority.<br /><br />There are ways to win a big number of regular and loyal customers, by using the best marketing ideas, coupled with technological innovations.&nbsp; The same formula as Apple uses to sell iphones and ipads, by manipulating your reality, implanting images. I have no doubt there are innovations in drug vending,&nbsp; technologically feasible right now, that would make a savvy SR vendor look like Steve Jobs or Richard Branson caliber, far beyond the rest of the crowd. Who is going to be the successful innovator?<br /><br />The OP made a catchy subject line for this thread. Here&#039;s what it really means. There is nothing that is too good to be true. 10 thousand a week is only a number. If you want 30 thousand a week, or whatever, it&#039;s possible, too. It&#039;s all relative. Many people would not be satisfied with &quot;only&quot; 10K a week, such as subscribers to Forbes magazine.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s much easier to make your money legally, then you can spend it getting as wasted as you want to, without worries.<br /><br />OK. Any questions? Class dismissed.&nbsp; ;- )--~<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wish every newbie that is &quot;considering&quot; selling on a medium-large scale would read, dissect, and study this post starting with, &quot;...having to get others involved who can fuck you up&quot;. I don&#039;t know anyone who can make $10K/week without trusting SOMEBODY. And that person MUST have the same vision as you, no if, ands, or buts. This is very rare though (nowadays) because more people tell than not. I see it everyday and I really do believe the statistic that states, &quot;...at least 70% of drug cases involve informants.&quot;<br /><br />In a lot of cases, it really is &quot;easier to make your money legally&quot;, but more importantly it is &quot;safer to make money legally&quot; <br /><br />-Judge

Make sure you research vendors well enough to obtain (to the best of your ability) a pretty good knowledge about their stealths (i.e. going through pages of feedback and reading comments regarding stealth, not necessarily quality of product). Most of the bulk RC vendors get their products dropshipped and all have about the same quality. Stealth that&#039;s like night and day between some vendors. It is basically in the hands Chinese underground labs. I&#039;ve been to a few, and to be frank, I don&#039;t see how it makes it though anyone&#039;s customs.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Judge<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sound, cheers for the info.

Like Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad for example. A good dealer needs self control and should not be getting high on their own supply. That&#039;s a longstanding rule to success in the drug market.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t follow this rule then you will not succeed in dealing drugs. <br /><br />That aside, OP made a good point. Huge profits can be made from the road, especially in places with high to moderate demand with almost zero supply.
