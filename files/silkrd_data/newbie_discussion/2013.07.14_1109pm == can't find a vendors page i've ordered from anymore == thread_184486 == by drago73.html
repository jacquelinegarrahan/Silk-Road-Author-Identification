				Made purchase yesterday, and it still says processing. However, the listing that i bought is no longer listed, and worse; the vendor&#039;s page is no longer on record. WTF! Should i be alarmed? What other explanation could there be for a vendor&#039;s page vanishing all of a sudden. Please help.

				ok no longer visible could mean the vendor has RAN OUT, and or discontinued it (PULLED IT).<br /><br />Not sure what you mean by Vendor is no longer on Record. ?<br /><br />If you mean no longer visible, you might have a wrong url, if a vendor gets there, vending privilege&#039;s stopped, it does not mean they wont be there it just means all you can do is send a message to them.<br /><br />I think i got it right maybe someone else can clarify

				Sometimes vendors go into stealth mode, in that case you can&#039;t see them unless you have joined their fan list. Sometimes they go on vacation mode, I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called, and disappear for a while. ^Tell us who the vendor is and maybe someone here can put your mind at ease. Whats it gonna hurt??

Apparently i&#039;m not the only one after looking her name up in theses forums. Sr support was kind enough though to transfer the btc back into account. Whew! I try to give everybody the benefit of the doubt, when it comes to my hard earned money I wasn&#039;t gonna just sit and wait 3 weeks for resolution. Thanks for the feedback.
