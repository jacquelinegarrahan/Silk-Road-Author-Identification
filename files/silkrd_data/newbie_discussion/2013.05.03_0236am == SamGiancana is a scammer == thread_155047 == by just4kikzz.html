Sorry to hear about your misfortune; the only thing you can do is report the vendor to SR Support and never FE for any vendor in the future, even if you have made successful purchases from them before. SR Support cannot do anything about orders that are not kept in escrow. As far as they are concerned, &#039;finalised&#039; means that the order was received and everything was satisfactory. If there&#039;s a problem, that is what the Resolution Center is for.<br /><br />99% of the time you will be able to find a vendor offering the product you desire that does not require FE. Sometimes it may be a little pricier but personally speaking I would rather pay $10 or so more for an order that will remain in escrow. As I said to just4kikzz though, it&#039;s a hard way to learn never to FE. :(<br /><br />Sorry that we can&#039;t be of more help in this instance.<br /><br />Libertas

				Just in the past month we&#039;ve seen several of these, and it&#039;s starting to become a trend. Disgruntled vendors going rogue.. Get that one last big cash out before leaving. <br /><br />Sad truth is, even with tons of buyer history I get asked to FE quite often, and some vendors only do FE sales, so it&#039;s hard to separate who&#039;s legit and who&#039;s running off with your coins.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to say &quot;never FE&quot; when all you want is some weed, but for more exotic products, or vendors from farflung locales lots of vendors don&#039;t extend the escrow olive branch and just accept the loss in sales as part of the business.

				Lets hope he comes through! Ordered 3 days ago. First buy, although friends have ordered and been successful.<br /><br />He was very quick in messaging after the order had been placed. FE&#039;d due to the whole 20% thing.<br /><br />Fingers crossed, hopefully he posts on this thread!<br />

It is your right to stay within escrow, remember that! :)<br /><br />I hope you enjoy your next purchase on the Road, and hope you have a great weekend to make up for losing out this time.

				I also have doubts about samgiancana. Placed a 1g order to him about 10 days ago and he claimed to have packed it and shipped it within 6 minutes of me placing the order. No show as of so far.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m skeptical but his demeanor screams scammer to me.<br /><br />Hope I&#039;m wrong

I&#039;ve personally seen three long-time vendors who filled hundreds of orders &quot;break bad&quot; and walk off with tens of thousands just in the past week; StatofEuphoria, DreamDimension, SamGiancana--all broke bad just in the past WEEK alone!<br /><br />SR support simply says don&#039;t FE and we can&#039;t help you, this is not our problem but yours. Their answer is to simply never FE, but if you&#039;ve been here long enough you&#039;ll find that this model only really works when you&#039;re buying common items like weed or trivial amounts. If you want precursors or just about any bulk listing, more times than not you are required to FE. There is a legitimate reason vendors require FE with certain products, so I wish management would take a more nuanced look at the problem. <br /><br />

I don&#039;t even like thinking about that shit!<br />Thanks for the business brother! 3 days read<br />delete<br />clpicard Hi Sam. I have read your posts and other peoples feedback in the forums. You seem like a very stand up and professional person. I .. like u .. was ripped off by teflon don.. THE BASTARD.. sorry u lost so much...and in another transaction the product was terrible.. so I am a bit gun shy with Fe. I think I will take a chance with you though and FE. I have a question for US tracking for .35 bc is that the same as express mail? How fast will it take to get to san jose california? If i do regular shipping with Fe how long will that take to get to san jose , ca. finally if i do Fe early how do u know so that I get 20% more??? do i put in feedack Fe early for 20% extra??<br />.<br />Thanks for your time,<br />.<br />clpicard 3 days read<br />delete<br />&lt; 1 2<br />.<br />Regards&nbsp; &nbsp;clpicard<br /><br />##########<br /><br />What the hell clpicard1?!
