				If you don&#039;t like what they do, you don&#039;t have to be here.&nbsp; They have offered this service and so far they&#039;ve done a great job maintaining it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a free market, that means you&#039;re free to use it and free to decline to use it.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t bash on them or call them names, it&#039;s not constructive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Deal with it, because honestly you have lost much, or contact a mod or admin and let them know your feelings in a mature respectful manner.&nbsp; I guarantee 95%+ of the questions you guys wanna ask have been answered before in the forums so if you use the search function and don&#039;t pointlessly clog up the forums, it&#039;d be better and easier to find the information you want.

				They do what they can for the benefit of all. Yes, we all have setbacks to deal with. Spam on a thread in this section dedicated to reaching the 50 post mark like the rest of us. You could have accomplished this in one day if you just sat down and took the time out to do so like many others did. There is nobody to blame but yourself for not reaching Jr. Member status to escape the Noob Hell you are currently confined to. I speak from experience. I have been lazy as tits with re-establishing my post count since I have been more inclined to read other peoples&#039; contributions since the reset, rather than contribute...until meow. And I am taking the moral high road by posting relevant, educational/advisory comments here in the Noob section. Rather than spam like fuck. I did a few spams though, but pretty much exclusively on BTC scam copy/pasta whores.

				Tor was designed by us military in case of attack from nuclear emp, homeland attacks, to enable them to keep connected.<br />They soon realized they made a big mistake when they discovered it could not be disabled and pulled the funding plug.<br /><br />&nbsp;It still runs they made something that cant be stopped. <br /><br />If Tor was government/military run operation it would of been shut down long ago. <br /><br />Newbiz at least do some research, i might have a few facts wrong here but most of it is right.<br /><br />Long live the tor project.!<br />

				I don&#039;t know what the big deal about the 50 post thing is. I&#039;m almost there and I&#039;ve only been a member for a day. I haven&#039;t even been spamming, just actually posting in the newbie thread like they say you should.
