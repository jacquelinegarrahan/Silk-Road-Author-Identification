				I&#039;m by no means a heavy user and so very unfamiliar with the wide and wonderful world of strains. I enjoy walking around and hanging out with people when high instead of turning into a silent potato, so what kind should I look for? I&#039;m not going to use much and therefore can afford to pay for really high quality.<br /><br />So let&#039;s hear it fellas, what&#039;s the best weed you&#039;ve ever had? Not interested in the lethargic high!

				by the sounds of it you want a sativa or sativa leaning hybrid . I suggest Ny city diesel , sour diesel . Durbin poison , The purps (my fave ) to name a few . what strains have you looked at in your price range ? perhaps I can help make a choice .

				PrivateReserve offers some of the best quality on here, other than that most people offer decently high quality, you just have to find a strain you want. But hands down best bud I&#039;ve had was from privatereserve, it was grown and cured perfectly. Other people I&#039;ve had recently I can think of off the top of my head: <br />weedgirls *top quality weed but its never grown perfectly, so I consider it A quality out of AAA*<br />muskabuzz *top quality, I still think privatereserve has better quality - AAA*<br />purefiremeds *medium quality - I&#039;d say between B and A-, it&#039;s outdoor, low amount of crystals on it but its still great bud, grown well, and cheap.<br />xinhai *decent, not amazing.. His caviar, although best seller, is pretty much bud covered in black oil with a TINY bit of kief on it, it doesn&#039;t even compare to the other caviar I&#039;ve had on here, which sadly, is no longer being sold. - it was bud covered in HONEY OIL that was bathed in kief.. a huge difference.*<br />buttonwood *AAA quality, nice strains, grown by the vendor, good bud*<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame I can&#039;t remember the other people.

				Weed isnt equal weed for everyone.<br /><br />You have to find your own taste. Indica, Sativa, Hybrid. Its all not the same.<br /><br />My tip to you: Buy a 5x1g sample pack from dutchmagic. Good quality and quantity for a low price and you get to try a variety of weed before you make your decision on which is your favorite type.

				My favorite weed has to be &quot;Ak-47&quot; damn that stuff is potent. I&#039;ve been smoking for a decent amount of years now and that stuff still blows my brain.

				Although I would love to shamelessly self-promote and tell you to buy what I&#039;m selling now (which are Indica dominant CA strains), it does sound like you&#039;d be best served by a Sativa-based strain.&nbsp; CannabisCup&#039;s listing looks like a good choice.<br /><br />However, rather than fully going by what everyone says, you should try both, i.e., Sativa and Indica and do a little experiment.&nbsp; Smoke each on separate occasions, both by yourself and with other people, and assess your experiences.&nbsp; Only then will you know what you really like.&nbsp; I say this because each person reacts to weed differently and Indica can be a very good choice even when you want to remain active, as long as you control the dosage.<br /><br />Try several and build your own empirical evidence.<br /><br />Either way, hope you find something to your liking and report back once you do!
