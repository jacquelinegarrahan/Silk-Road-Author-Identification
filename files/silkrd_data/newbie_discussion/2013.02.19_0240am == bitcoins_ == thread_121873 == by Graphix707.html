				Graphix, <br /><br />I used to be in your position. We&#039;re just making it seem more confusing than it actually is. <br /><br />First, I suggest you create an online wallet for your coins while connected on TOR. You don&#039;t want authorities making <br />a connection with you and a wallet you created while on clearnet. From there you can send the coins to a tumbler <br />(really hides where your coins from) or just straight to your SR wallet. I think SR tumbles the coins too.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are several ways you can purchase your coins; moneypaks, bitinstant, mtgox, etc. It&#039;s not illegal to buy coins<br />so don&#039;t let that bother you. However; being anonymous while purchasing coins should be a priority. And honestly, <br />the easier and the more anonymous you can get your coins the better. Personally, I suggest using Blue Sky Traders. <br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm These guys are amazing. <br /><br />Get familiar with their site and how they operate. Basically, you send them an email stating how many coins you want to <br />trade and the wallet address you want the coins sent to. Once they get your email, they send you a order confirmation <br />email stating how much money you would need to deposit. Once you deposit the cash, it takes about an hour to get your<br />coins. <br /><br />That&#039;s about it, dude. Good luck.<br /><br />

				there are lots of exchanges that will accept a bank transfer.&nbsp; some sites let you use chase or pnc (proly others) for cash deposit.&nbsp; gotta search around for the best fees.<br /><br />bitinstant really rapes on the fees.

				Bitinstant is not so bad.... Its been a while since I&#039;ve actually purchased a bitcoin with bitinstant but if you want to save yourself money here is what I used to do.<br /><br />Go create an account at www.btc-e.com.<br />Start your bitinstant transfer just as you would have before....<br />Choose to deposit to BTC-E.... you just enter your BTC-e Username<br />You will receive USD into your BTC-e account.<br />You do NOT receive bitcoin.<br />You now go and make an offer on the board.... even for lower than market price and some seller might accept it.<br />Or you can buy right away at market price if you dont want to wait.<br />Either way. BTC-E was charging .1 percent vs MtGox&#039;s .3 percent fees last time i checked.<br />That alone can save you 10-20 dollars sometimes....<br />If you buy in bulk... bitcoin dealers on BTC-e are more likely to sell to you lower than market price.<br />BTC-e market prices are also generally 10percent or more lower that the MtGox market!<br />So right now Mt.Gox is 30.5 per coin?<br />Btc-e is 28.99 per coin.<br />No bullshit.<br />not a scam.<br />Get your coins and then send them to your SR wallet.<br />

				Hey guys. I&#039;ve been using my blockchain wallet for cash deposit, moneygram, zipzap, to wallet, then to SR. I love how easy it is, but if I deposit $500, it costs me about $30 to do so. Currently, Bitinstant is down and my wallet only has an option for moneypaks. Now, I&#039;m fairly new, and I did alot of research before jumping in and buying BTC for the first time. Would someone mind explaining the moneypak process in a way that may allow me to use it today, since I have no idea how long bitinstant is down for. Also, how do the fees compare? I realize I could spend hours searching the site here for answers, but fuck man, the search function on this site is pretty shitty compared to other sites I&#039;m used to. Not that I&#039;m bitching. This site is amazing. Anyway, thanks for any help folks. Peace.
