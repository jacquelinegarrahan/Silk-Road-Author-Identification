				Hello there!<br /><br />I&#039;m a new vendor here on Silk Road, not so new IRL.&nbsp; It is time to expand markets!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been growing for eight years, the last five of which have been mentored by someone who has been growing for three decades.&nbsp; I focus on small batches and high quality, I do not have a warehouse with 100 lights going.&nbsp; I have been growing plants for most of my life so this was a natural extension.&nbsp; Every batch is hand watered daily, grown to maturity (never pulled early), trimmed as soon as it&#039;s off the main stalk and properly cured before bagging so that the best of the plant&#039;s characteristics can come out.&nbsp; I never use any sort of chemical, fungicide or insecticide.&nbsp; <br /><br />Currently I have Blue Dream Haze for sale.&nbsp; I&#039;m offering ten 1g samples where all you pay is shipping (and apparently part of the commission?), as a get-to-know-you deal: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2555add56f<br /><br />I am initially offering ounces ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d9b8fbe880 ) and QPs ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/10ca19fb30 ), with enough demand I may offer half-ounces as well.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, there was no demand but I decided half-ounces are going up as well: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/49aa740c69<br /><br />ALSO: I am not exactly sure how shipping works yet and if you can consolidate orders via the system, but if you&#039;d like two or three ounces, message me and I can create a private listing so shipping doesn&#039;t get multiplied.<br /><br />Questions/comments/suggestions are welcome!

				inthefade,<br /><br />Depending on how this goes, I may stick my toes into the water of international shipping in the future.&nbsp; I would love nothing more than to have my products getting people high all over the globe!!&nbsp; Not only for the expanded market, that would just be a badass feeling.&nbsp; Gotta walk before you can run though.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to announce if/when it happens&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Princess,<br /><br />Thank you!!!

				Thanks again!&nbsp; I actually pored over most of the shipping threads before I made my account.&nbsp; I now have a rather large box of heat seal mylar bags in my garage.&nbsp; I did some testing of my own too, no PE vac seal bags (previous standard), just a single layer of the heat seal mylar.&nbsp; I left it on the seat of my enclosed car in direct sunlight from about 10am-6pm.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t smell a single thing, even right under my nose, and actual packaging is a bit more robust than that.&nbsp; Silk Road has already helped me step up my game!<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m not exactly comfortable with customs at the moment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t doubt it&#039;ll happen sometime, just not at the moment :)

				I&#039;m already getting a strong vibe that international shipping for high quality weed is desired. <br /><br />Y&#039;all have spoken!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be doing some research.&nbsp; Expect international shipping within a month.

				All samples are out the door, that was quick!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to put another strain up in a couple days, with another sample sale.&nbsp; This one is a nice strong indica and unless my searching abilities have failed me, isn&#039;t currently offered on Silk Road so stay tuned!

				I was lucky enough to have not just been able to buy one but TWO of these 1G samples. These buds are beautiful and easy to break up without a grinder.<br /><br />I&#039;m only smoking a bowlful right now and I&#039;m very high. <br /><br />The smoke wasn&#039;t very harsh which was also welcome.<br /><br />The packaging was also very discrete, it was way more than what I expected compared to other orders I&#039;ve done for 1/8ths of weed.
