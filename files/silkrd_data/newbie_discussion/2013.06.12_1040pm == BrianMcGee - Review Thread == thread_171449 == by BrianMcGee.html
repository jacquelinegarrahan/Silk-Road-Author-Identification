				Scam, canceled order immediately after taking $400 MoneyPak funds, was vague and elusive and has not been responding to messages since.

				His listings screamed scam but you never know these days.<br /><br />I feel like SR is slipping away and everyone is watching it go to hell......<br /><br />A lot of scamming going on these days on SR.... Do they know something I don&#039;t?

				More users. Harder to keep track of everything. <br /><br /><br />I think SR should ban the sale of bitcoins through the site. Unless they accept bitcoin sales and reconfigure the escrow system to support the sale of coins. <br /><br />Meaning the seller has to hold the coins in escrow prior to engaging in the sale. Taking someones money and then cancelling the order seems to be the norm for these goofs.

				I do know of 2, probably more, active legit coin vendors here on SR, coinxchange and jumbomonkeybiscuit. CXC has a lot of orders and is looking at about 24 - 48 hour turn around time. JMB has a lot of orders and is looking at about 3 - 20 hours turn around time. Difference in fees and turn around time say a lot for these vendors. However their customers them love them. Mostly because they get coin I&#039;m sure&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m honestly confused why a moderator/administrator has not taken action against this scammer. At the very least, suspend his account until some type of review can be done.<br /><br />I&#039;m really confused how something like this can be allowed to happen more than once, when the people getting scammed come forward and make complaint.

				Also scammed me, wrote me long messages saying moneypak has frozen his accounts and blah blah... saying he was not trying to scam me and what not and then cashed my $500 moneypak and not my $30 one and never replied to any messages after that. fucking doucher<br /><br /><br />Any way i can get it back since i have the receipt and physical card? SR needs to suspend his account or something before others lose money

				Well I just lost a 150$ with this guy, all things considered it&#039;s one of the cheaper lessen I&#039;ve had to learn.<br />He did seem fishy from the start but he was the only vender I saw that would go under 200$ why I ended up using him.<br />The funny thing is if he had paid out I would have sent him 500$ two weeks from now, so it could have been worse. <br /><br />Now if the newbie forum could get a sticky on this sort of thing that would be awesome, another reason&nbsp; I chose him<br />was because there seemed to not be any moneypak scam threads up.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Scouts post kinda goes over it be seems to be more focused on the bitcoin side of things)<br /><br />I hope threads like this end up saving others time and money. <br /><br />-Monkkey
