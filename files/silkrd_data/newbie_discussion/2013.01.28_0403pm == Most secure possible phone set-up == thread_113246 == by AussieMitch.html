				I&#039;ve been thinking alot about this lately and reviewing the way I do business, and I believe i&#039;ve come up with the most secure way possible for me to communicate with my guys in real life to organize deals. Keep in mind that I don&#039;t have access to affordable SMS to Email services and I have to keep my methods simple enough that anyone I might deal with can follow them:<br /><br />1. Buy a burner phone with no connection to my real identity and register a pre-paid SIM with it in a fake name. Everytime the SIM runs out of credit buy a new phone and SIM.<br />2. Choose a burner phone without any GPS or Internet capability like the Nokia 101 and disable the microphone so it can only be used for texting.<br />3. Explain to all of my contacts that they are to save this number in their phones under a plausible-sounding fake name (Like &#039;James Harding&#039; or something) and to only send non-suss text messages.<br />4. Give locations that I meet people at fake names and give everyone nicknames when texting. Also make no mention of the names of drugs and use a coded method of communicating prices if necessary.<br />5. Always end my messages with a symbol that is not a full-stop (like / , \ -&nbsp; etc) and have all my contacts do the same, in-case LE takes control of a phone and tries to organize a setup.<br />6. Always lie about exactly where I am, who i&#039;m with or what i&#039;m doing if asked via text message, and don&#039;t communicate any non-essential information.<br />7. Make sure I never do ANYTHING that is drug-related or even the slightest bit illegal on my personal phone. Use Tormail for any really suss communication that I need to have with my runners and with my business partner or just meet up in real life and have a conversation away from any houses or cars or anywhere a bug could be placed.<br /><br />Is this the safest way I can organize my deals in real life, that isn&#039;t massively time-consuming and inconvenient? I can&#039;t see any real holes in this setup.

				Seems like you got it all down packed. <br />Only issue that is more or less unavoidable is :<br />If one of your clients or business partner is not as smart as you and gets caught, <br />will they cut a deal in giving you up to avoid the long prison sentence?<br /><br />You can be as strong as you want but if one of the beams in your support structure is weak, then<br />you will come falling down with the rest of your business.

				Don&#039;t turn your burner phone on and off in the same place all the time, don&#039;t have it on for longer than you need it, and never carry it with your personal phone on at the same time, don&#039;t turn one off and the other immediately on, and vice versa.<br /><br />Might be being overly paranoid, but if someone had the cell-connection records for every phone in an area, it would be pretty easy to establish a link between two phones given an hour or so of movement with them both on the same person. So I&#039;d say to be safe, try to break any link in cell-connection records between your burner and your personal phone, and the easiest way to do that is never carry them both at the same time.
