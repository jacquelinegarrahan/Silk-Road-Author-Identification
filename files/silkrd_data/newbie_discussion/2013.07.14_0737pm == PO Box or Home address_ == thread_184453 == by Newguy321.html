				i would have thought PO box would be more risky. LE could easily wait for you to pick it up and then you have to explain why you picked it up. you will have willingly gone there to pick up the drugs, that&#039;s hard to explain. <br /><br />if its sent to your house you can use different name, or you can argue that anyone could have sent it to you. even the cops could post it to you then bust thru your door 5 minutes after the postman.

				I&#039;ve had lots of orders sent to my house and my real name. A few times I&#039;ve got more than 1 package in a day, both in express envelopes, and, it&#039;s not uncommon for me to get packages 3-4 days out of the 6 mail days a week. Remember, good vendors make their shipments look like 1 piece of mail outa the millions they deal with every day. I just counted and in the last 3 months I&#039;ve had 57 orders delivered to my mailbox and my real name. Granted, no big weight on anything , but still , lots of orders and no issues. Mailmen just wanna get thru their route, their job isn&#039;t to be a mail cop. As long as your vendor has his stealth shit together and your orders make it thru the main mail hubs where the inspectors are, you should be set.

				Have it sent to your home, in your name.&nbsp; They&#039;re not after the buyers (who have no info on the sellers).&nbsp; They&#039;re after the sellers.&nbsp; And it will take them decades to figure out this pandora box that the government is responsible for opening.&nbsp; All hail DPR for putting the great technology to use!

				I have used my PO Box for approximately 30 transactions with no problems. But then my SR packages just blend into my normal mail. I live in a relatively small community (10,000 residents) and I rented a PO Box when relocating last year. I kept the PO Box even after I found a permanent residence. So all my mail goes to the PO Box, even a number of Amazon.com and other on-line purchases shipped via the USPS. So my small SR orders just loom like business as usual.

				I run an arcade equipment (the internal electronics) repair operation out of my house so it&#039;s not uncommon at all for me to get multiple packages a day so I don&#039;t worry about having stuff shipped to my house. The mail lady is used to me getting strange packages from all over the US and EU so she doesn&#039;t blink twice.

				My real name to my house. Heard PO boxes could potentially be more risky as you may have less plausible deniability when you&#039;re picking up drug mail in a specific PO box whereas stuff sent to your house you can argue you never ordered the contraband mail. Idk tho

				I live with a few people and we all order a lot of things off the internet including small electronic components that get shipped in sketchy looking packages from all over the world, so any SR orders just blend in.

				Its not a big deal if you have stuff sent there, just sign up for some junk mail online and have magazines sent there regularly.<br />Most important thing is to always use real name of real person. Some vendors explicitly tell you &quot;no fake BS&quot; .<br /><br />

				Although I&#039;m new to this I would think that as long as the vendor does his/her job right and someone isn&#039;t purchasing extremely large amounts, there should be little issue with shipping to home addresses.<br />In the US - the __ is so stretched thin, the larger organizations are more the target... personal use shouldn&#039;t be worth their time unless people are careless and stupid.<br /><br />Because of my profession i am always looking for little pieces of electronics on the internet.&nbsp; Some of the way the companies ship is not to be believed. <br />Makes you wonder.
