				So a few months back I had ordered 2 packages that should have arrived at the same time.&nbsp; At the expected time of delivery both were a no-show.&nbsp; One was a half oz of bud and another was a gram of oil.&nbsp; Eventually the oil arrived, the bud never did.&nbsp; I assume the vendor shipped it out and it was taken somewhere along the way.&nbsp; I say this because after a couple of packages arriving (not just illegal things) at the address I was using I started noticing there were small holes, about the size of what would be created by a key being pressed sideways against the package from the tip down from the key.&nbsp; After a couple of questions at the local post office they verified that their machines wouldn&#039;t create such a hole and that it must be the mailman himself, whom we&#039;ve previously seen stop before our mailbox and apparently take an extra peak at the mail. <br /><br />I have a couple of different options on where to have things sent.&nbsp; There is a Mom &amp; Pop mailbox place in town but the price is pretty ridiculous plus a $15 fee for any packages and with the $285 I&#039;m paying per oz I can&#039;t exactly afford that.&nbsp; I have friends that work at various stores and they actually receive orders of their own from clothings websites every so often.<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;ll be having to ship to one of the alternate addresses and ditching this one.<br /><br />My question<br />What would you do in this situation?<br />Legal ideas of retaliation?<br />Illegal ideas?<br />Thoughts on my alternate addresses?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a vengeful person and although I prefer peace I&#039;ve been known to go to some extremes just over my glass pieces that have been stolen.

				Send yourself a dummy mail stinking of weed , make it next day delivery to be sure you know when&nbsp; it&#039;s coming. See what happens ?<br />If you have plenty of spare time and money, mail yourself a box with a camera connected to a live feed and watch it 24/7.

				Guessing the camera would have to be 3G or GPRS in order to stream 24/7?&nbsp; I love this idea and have been thinking about something like this but with GPS tracking.
