				So I had everything in place to buy some btc from bitinstant. I set everything up on the site using a fake name, fake email I set up etc. I printed out the payment slip, and took it down to winco to make the payment via moneygram. I had to use the red phone, as they don&#039;t do the blue sheet thing. I entered the information, and then it transferred me to a representative. Everything was good, I used the same fake name and said I didn&#039;t have a phone number. Then she asked for my address. I was unprepared for this question, and because I didn&#039;t want to give ANY of my real information, I quickly told her that I was currently without an address. At this point she told me that she could not process my request without an address. Not knowing what to do I told her I just needed to pay this bill and I don&#039;t have an address to give her. she repeated herself. So I just told her I would have to figure something out, and ended the call. What should I do?? I thought I should probably wait for the 5 days to pass so the transaction is cancelled, and then try again with a fake address in mind. Will bitinstant not want to do a transaction with my btc address because of this?? Anyone have any Experience with this, or just some advice?? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!!!

				My advice: don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get a new SR BTC wallet address in the account section of your profile, then start over, new fake name, number etc and come armed with an address this time!<br /><br />If you wanna wait 5 days, wait 5 days but personally I don&#039;t think it thats much of big deal as long as you are pretty likely to get a different person doing the transaction for you.<br /><br />Its easy to get paranoid about this stuff, but the likelyhood of the feds being interested in your&nbsp; over a few or even couple dozen bitcoin is miniscule.

				So I tried to change my silkroad wallet address, and could not find a way on my account page. It says in the buyers guide wiki that after you make your first deposit an option to change your wallet address will appear on your account page. I have not made my first deposit. Anyone know a way around this???

				Exactly... if you&#039;re uncomfortable with this phase (in order to maintain anonymity) just use a fake address... I doubt they&#039;re going to ask to see your ID over the phone, so what is there to worry about? Just use a fake address up until the time that you place the order.
