				Hi,<br />I am new to this and I followed the instructions in changing my pass and pin before depositing bitcoins from my mtgox account. I used the address in my silk road account page.<br />It has been 8 hours and still no funds have arrived. I checked Blockchain and it shows the transaction going through to my address and also another transaction of it going on to another address.<br />Could I please have some assistance with this, thank you.

				No worries man. It has been known for over 24 hours now and threads like this keep popping up every other minute - there really should be a message on the main site by now or at least a sticky thread.

				I deposited 2 bitcoins to my sr account last night from MultiBit and it just came thru an hour ago (almost 14 hrs), I was scared that it might now have worked, but it did. I just tried sending some directly to SR from bitinstant an hour or so ago and it is usally in there by now, but still is not showing up. I think SR is having problems, I cant get on now (since 15 mins ago 4:53 eastern)

Try hitting &#039;Get a new identity&#039; in the Vidalia Control Panel, and if that doesn&#039;t work exit and relaunch Tor Browser.<br /><br />Regarding the transfer, please read the following excerpt from the Silk Road Wiki:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_isn.27t_my_deposit_showing_up_in_my_account.3F<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why isn&#039;t my deposit showing up in my account?<br /><br />It can take up to 6 hours for a deposit to be confirmed on the blockchain, processed, and credited to your Silk Road account. If your deposit still hasn&#039;t shown up, first check that it is showing up on the blockchain by searching for your deposit address on a site like blockchain.info. If your transfer doesn&#039;t appear here, then it was never sent and you need to find out why from the person or organization who initiated the transfer.
