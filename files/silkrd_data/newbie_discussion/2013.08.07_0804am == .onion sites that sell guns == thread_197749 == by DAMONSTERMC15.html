				Hi I&#039;m new to the silk road and I hope this isn&#039;t against the rules or anything, but are there any other .onion sites that sell guns like The Armory did? Also does anyone know if the Armory will be back up? I apologize if I&#039;m breaking any rules

				To be honest you&#039;ll probably have a better chance of buying a gun if you visit your local hood. BMR is FILLED with people looking to scam you. Last time I heard people talking about buying guns on BMR was a few months ago and there only like 2 reliable vendors out of the 100 listings. Unfortunately I don&#039;t remember their names, though :( sorry. But I wouldn&#039;t order guns through the mail, just my two bitcoins.

There are plenty non lethal semi-automatic pistols available widely for self defense purposes.<br /><br />People in Russia prefer to have those rather steel bullets.&nbsp; Anyway they are lethal if you shot in a head 15-20 meters far.<br /><br />Peace
