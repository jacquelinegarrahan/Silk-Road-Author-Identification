				My absolute favorite strain is this premium stuff I get from Seattle, my dealer simply calls it &quot;Seattle&quot;. Not sure if it&#039;s the same strain, but I also bought an O of stuff from Seattle (same dealer) still in the medical bag which was labeled &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, it was completely purple, unlike the usual Seattle stuff I get, and I didn&#039;t smoke any of it so I don&#039;t know. But this shit is seriously the craziest stuff on earth. Literally covered in trichomes, it&#039;s a fresh, healthy looking green and it doesn&#039;t even feel like regular bud, it feels slightly damp and almost like a &quot;real&quot; plant. The high is extremely psychedelic; OEVs all over, puts you into a deep thinking state, as well as being euphoric as fuck. Only downside is extreme dry mouth, but not too bad on red eye and munchies (which some may consider a good thing anyway).<br /><br />My favorite commercial strain is Jack The Ripper; along the same vein as my Seattle but less potent and a ton more red eye and munchies.

				The best weed I ever smoked was from vendor CoffeeShopUK. It was the first batch of Grand Daddy Purple they had in, and it was absolutely flawless. The high was deeper and more comprehensive than anything I&#039;ve smoked before, it came as beautifully round and purple nuggets, the smell was like rich berries and wine with no chemical taste at all, it was extremely potent, and after a week of smoking it daily every joint still got me just as stoned as the first. I suffer from anxiety and I felt it all just melt away with that weed too. <br /><br />Really couldn&#039;t be faulted at all. I just hope I can get hold of some more one day.

				I was visiting New York City one night and we were drinking. My friend invited someone over from Brooklyn to bring some pot over. He said the strain was called &quot;9/11.&quot; Shit fucking destroyed me. I don&#039;t remember anything. My friend said I wound up beating the shit out of everybody and pissing the bed among other things. They were fine though. I guess I just drank too much. But shit was strong. Put me on another planet. And you gotta love the name and city it comes from. Guarantee you now Texan potheads are gonna accept a strain of weed called 9/11.

				I&#039;m going to have to go with Soul Shine.&nbsp; First of all, the name is beautiful and makes everyone want to buy it.&nbsp; Just having it makes them happy.&nbsp; But looking past it&#039;s pretty package, it&#039;s a wonderfully euphoric (even erotic) strain that you can&#039;t help but crack a smile on.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see some sellers on here get a hold of some.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are the first few reviews from leafely:<br /><br />&quot;Though it&#039;s heavy on the indica aspect, it&#039;s also energizing and gives a psychedelic experience. Great for unwinding and some fun. It was a dream.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Soulshine, a really suprising strain u slowly try to discover it and u get soooo euphoric u cant get enough of this little unique taste tht i describe as bubblehash ,thick dense nug trichromy and smelly,yum!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A lovely high. Made me very stoned, slightly psychadelic. Puts a smile on your face from the first toke. Gave me a serious case of the munchies.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Simply amazing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Love this strain to bits. Very fruity and musty smell/taste and it really gives you this nice glowing feeling in the center of your body. The name does really suit as was said by another reviewer here. Perfect for active smokers who need pain relief and really just a fun strain to smoke. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;gave me a nice couch/bed lock. sort of euphoric. would smoke again. evening recommended&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bought some Soul Shine from One Love Beach Club in Long Beach, and boy does the name reflect the bud. Although it&#039;s a hybrid, Soul Shine had very powerful sativa effects, and honestly has been one of the most uplifting buds I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of smoking. Absolutely no couch lock from this one. Rather, it&#039;s extremely energetic, light, airy, and makes you want to do something creative/take a walk/have a stimulating conversation. I highly recommend it.&quot;
