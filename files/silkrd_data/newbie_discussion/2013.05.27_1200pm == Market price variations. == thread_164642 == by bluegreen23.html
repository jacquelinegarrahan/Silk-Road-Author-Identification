				So, how does a person take into account the differences in price and quality based on location?<br /><br />some examples to illustrate. <br />weed in California/BC vs New York.<br />Cocaine in New Mexico/Miami vs Alaska/Australia<br />Heroin in Asia vs North America.<br /><br />etc etc

				Well you may have to pay more for high quality domestically but that&#039;s the price you pay for skipping customs, always check out feedback to see what people are saying about the product you want to buy. <br />

				I was more thinking from a seller point of view. For instance I know that cocaine in my area is often heavily cut, difficult to come by, and fairly expensive. However Weed is top quality, a world leader even, and is cheap/plentiful. <br /><br />How does a seller account for this? I know if I was ever to sell I know that cocaine would be of a lesser quality and even at break even price would most likely cost more than someone from Miami or So Cal. However apart from a few sellers here I believe that weed I could offer a top grade product at minimal cost. But as a seller I would be losing out on income on selling weed at my market value, and would most likely receive horrible reviews for cocaine and not be able to sell it.

				People will pay whatever they are willing to pay, location other than intl/domestic becomes a rather moot point on a site like this.&nbsp; But thats one of the great things about the road, you can get stuff not normally available in your area

				Ideally the market will adapt to this, with the best value goods earning the most money for vendors as they&#039;ll get the most sales. The use of forums &amp; reviews means that you can research the goods you are buying and bad quality products will result in less sales for vendors, so they should be more inclined to provide good products at a good price.<br /><br />Of course, this is somewhat subverted by monopolies due to domestic vs overseas security and the lack of individual testing. Plus good &amp; cheap drugs may be harder to get through customs, so in exchange for security people will go for a lesser quality product, but I&#039;d argue that the better product is the one with less long-term bad effects (possibility of prison due to package interception)<br /><br />In the end, if you&#039;re getting a product that you like, that&#039;s all that matters. If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy from that person again, simple as that.

I oversimplified it a bit in my original post by assuming that everyone could get a good quality product regardless of location, so I get what you mean now. Before I go on I should say that I&#039;m nowhere near knowing a lot about economics, so someone could easily come in here and have a proper answer for a question and I could be missing something really obvious.<br /><br />I suppose that there&#039;s no real way to account for the weaker quality orange, and it comes down to a bit of a cost-benefit analysis by the vendor. If you sell the crappy orange at a tiny profit, it&#039;s still better than no profit, no? It&#039;s unavoidable that some people are going to be able to offer better products at lower costs, and it&#039;s up to the vendor to decide if it&#039;s worth selling at a little profit, or if their time and money is better invested in what they can do best. If you can spend $10 on oranges and make $1 profit or spend $10 on apples and make $10 profit, surely it&#039;s better for you to focus on selling apples? Who cares if you&#039;re no longer selling oranges, you&#039;re making far more money with your apples.<br /><br />As for the consumer, this could lead to it being more difficult to get certain products if they can only order what they want from an international source, but then a vendor can justify a higher price if they can supply the same product domestically, as it&#039;s more secure for the customer and that security adds to the value of the product.<br /><br />On a somewhat side note, I&#039;m not sure if a cartel structure is in the best interest of anyone except for vendors, and I&#039;m gonna plant myself on the side of customers in advocating against cartels.

				Just wanted to say thank you for walking through this with me. I figured the options were limited much the same way a mom and pop shop might have trouble competing with walmart or an exotic specialty boutique. I&#039;ll have to try and figure this out but as you said perhaps it&#039;s better to sell apples.&nbsp; ;D
