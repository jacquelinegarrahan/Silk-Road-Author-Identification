				I don&#039;t know how germany&#039;s laws are, but here in the land of the free, it&#039;s scarry what kind of laws we have. In my state, mandatory felony for 1 little itty bitty pill even. I believe in felonies for child molesters and rapists and what not, but the prison systems over here are getting more and more privatized.

				Nope. My own person. I piggybacked a couple of his posts the other night, because i had money tied up with the same vendor and was worried i was going to get scammed. I thought he was the vendor, just under a different name trying to lure more victims. Turned out i was wrong, thank god. No scam. I could be way out in left field with this jack n hoff, it&#039;s i remember seeing you posting on one of those threads. If i am, please excuse my crazy ass then!

				Maybe i&#039;m not just a dumbass afterall, because i got suspicious of it too. Was only wrong in thinking he was the vendor. I can&#039;t explain it, but them posts, and even a few pm&#039;s from him kicked in my spidey-senses. Oh well.
