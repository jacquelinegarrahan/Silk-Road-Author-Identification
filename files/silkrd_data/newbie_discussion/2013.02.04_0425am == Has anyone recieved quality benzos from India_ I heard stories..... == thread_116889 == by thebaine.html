				<br />I would like to hear if people have had any experience ordering bulk benzos from india.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard horror stories of ppl getting fake pills, pills that had drug on one half of the pill and not the other, getting pills with nothing scored on them to identify....and on and on.&nbsp; I want to order because of the price but if its 25percent in quality i might just order domestic.

				Honestly unless you can find a really reliable vendor who has never had any issues with weak poor quality home style pressed pills, or even fake ones, I would just order domestically. It&#039;s not worth the cheaper price getting pills that risk only having 50% of the active drug in them, not to mention the issue with smuggling them threw customs. Smuggling them threw customs is going to put eyes on your drop address for future deliveries, also having your order seized sucks to. Also if something ever did go sideways and you did get charged, getting charged with the importation of narcotics threw smuggling is a much worse crime.<br /><br />In my opinion the rewards don&#039;t out weigh the risks involved. Hope this helped. Again I&#039;m just giving you advice on what I would do if it were me.<br /><br />PS Be careful with building a benzo tolerance, benzo withdrawal is way worse then for example opiate withdrawal, and there isn&#039;t any drugs like Subuxone or Methadone for benzo withdrawal like exists for opiates, not to mention unlike withdrawing from something like opiates, benzo withdrawal can actually be fatal. I speak from experience so be careful with long-term use. Just a fellow traveller looking out for my neighbor so be safe!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />-LokeToke

				[LokeToke: Actually benzos like diazepam (Valium) and phenazepam work much the same a suboxone for benzo withdrawal, as these substances have multi-day half-lives. Otherwise you&#039;re right in a nutshell that you&#039;ll see I cracked open below&nbsp; :P]<br /><br /><br />Etilaam brand etizolam tablets are made in India by Intas Pharmaceuticals. Intas makes an excellent, dose-accurate product, and advertises exactly what they sell, much like any other regulated western pharmaceutical market. <br /><br />Having said that, I would recommend Intas&#039;s etiz tablets, as they are touted by many people (myself included) to be excellent in quality, professional and sterile.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve noticed you have to watch out for is some of the counterfeit medicines that are largely produced in lax-regulated nations like Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Out of 5 stamped pills originating from India, Sri Lanka or Pakistan, only 1 imprint could be verified as either the real thing, or a great knock off. The 2 sides were printed identical to the brand in question, with accurate product ID stamps and little if any colour variation.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t want to make you feel that India is a safe haven for easy to get, affordable, good quality drugs (well Canada gets a lot of ketamine from there, and that&#039;s always been good). If you can get confirmation that Intas made the product (Blister packs, full print boxes), you can be fairly confident in what your getting. No problem here.<br /><br /><br />Problem #1: India shares EXTENSIVE borders with their neighboring, poorly regulated nations. I have received a sample from an Indian supplier once from a supplier who claimed to produce 2000+ 2mg Xanax Bars/month, as well as 1000 Roche Valium 10mg pills/month if required &quot;The real ones&quot;, he said, so sure of himself. I know my shit, and I recieved my package from the city of Bangalore in India (I think it&#039;s close to Sri Lanka). Google maps revealed the first red flag before I opened the package with an address search. Upon opening the product, the smell of the pills was unlike any pharmaceutical I had ever smelt (I smell a lot of things, and probably suffer brain damamge from it&nbsp; :P But it keeps me safe). <br /><br /><br /><br />Counterfeit XANAX<br /><br /><br />The Xanax bar was the main culprit of unsanitary (although not particularly unpleasant on the outside, it was a bit more disgusting than neutral by the time I chewed it). Again, I wasn&#039;t new to benzos, I knew what alprazolam tasted like in various forms. After hours of online research on both products, they most certainly were not genuine, but from that same imprint and colour shade I got a range of reports from different sources that were documented within the last 3 months. Some said that it may have had &#039;some&#039; alprazolam in what should&#039;ve been exactly 2mg and would produce greater than threshold effects with some of the intolerant users reporting this. Others reported getting a good batch that was more like 3-4mg. This is not a game I was feeling to great about after divulging that info. <br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/655496-Fake-Xanax-Lab-report<br /><br />^That link looks exactly like the ones I got. and posted around the same time.<br /><br />So it was my turn to try it. I understood it was counterfeit, but I also realized it had potential to be dosed quite accurately (quite accurate shouldn&#039;t be a dose interval with chemicals active at 0.5mg). I chewed half the off-white &quot;XANAX&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;2&quot; bar in my mouth for about 2 minutes, all the while grimacing (most bitter chemicals cause me to grimace followed by an adaptation to the taste that remained the same throughout the product. Once that was down I observed the remaining half that I had broken along the score in a typical way. It seemed to be various sizes of solids, some with slight colour differences. From my observation, A heated mixture of alprazolam shit that I&#039;d lock away from my dog (was it a waste/by-product of better quality Xanax that was being sold elsewhere? Was it an poorly educated asshole who thinks he&#039;s a chemist with the best &quot;XANAX 2mg&quot; around?&nbsp; ::) Or did some bored teenagers find an old, fallable and distorted pill press, fill it with some alprazo-slime they acquired in a way I will never know (nor want to), clamp the press into place and pull out their homemade. clandestine and skewed of balanced pressure while forming. <br /><br />The end results were 2/3 hard as rock pill with a crumbly remaining portion, I received a total of 5 and they all had similar qualities of a poor press. My guess is a defective commercial press was used, or a manual press was used improperly and with improper binders. The pills did seem to have a glidant on the surface, clearly a residue from the press to prevent sticking. [Note: most of our pharma companies in civilized countries use dirt-cheap magnesium stearate to &quot;glaze&quot; their pills for easier swallowing, and to prevent press sticking/caking; known as a glidant in pharma production. This, along with the precise amount of binders and fillers/excipients evenly mixed together to form a homogenous tablet base, would be a very easy, smooth process if the press was in good shape and had a trained operator performing the process.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: These Xanax bars are not to be trusted, and although I felt like I could have been on 1mg of Xanax afterward, with all the similar benzos out there at low doses, I will never know if this product was &quot;as advertised&quot; beyond its copyright infringement.<br /><br /><br />Counterfeit&nbsp; ROCHE (Brand) 10mg Valium (diazepam)<br /><br />These ones were funnier than the Xanax bars at first look, because the emboss on the pills had: <br /><br />ROCHE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br /><br />On one side; and a maligned (in contrast to the opposite side) score on the back that seemed to deviate a little in its position from the 3 pills I had.<br /><br />I took one supposed dose of 10mg diazepam 2 days after the dirty alpraz experiment. This time I didn&#039;t chew it, I held it on my tongue like I have so many times before with the real Roche 10mgs and the generics (the pharmacy was always switch supplies, but I didn&#039;t notice any differences in quality, as they all came from regulated Canadian pharmacies. These fakes tasted slightly more bitter than their legit cousins. Presumably it was the added lye they used when producing the cheap knock-offs (jking :D... Or not&nbsp; :(&nbsp; ).<br /><br />So Valium always had a tendency in all brand/generic form to kick in after about 30mins on an empty stomach. Whether I took a 5mg tab, a 10mg tab or 5+ 10mg tabs. These felt much the same as the 10mg, but they took longer to kick in (50-60mins) on an empty stomach. Either it was a close cousin to diazepam, one of it&#039;s metabolites or a poor mixture/bad choice of inert ingredients. Once again I was left to speculate sketchy counterfeit pills, which shouldn&#039;t be taken lightly considering the problems benzo addiction can cause. I snapped one of the remaining 2 pills in half and noticed unusually hard &amp; thin, parallel layers, only visible upon desecration. The scaling reminded me of calcium carbonate. This wasn&#039;t an issue to me as I am familiar with calcium&#039;s abundance and wide-spread use in the supplement industry. I dropped my last whole one in a shot glass with 50ml of municipal tap water that was run thru a carbon filter. upon dropping it in u could see the tablet hesitate to break away and dissolve. Since I was comparing these to the regulated, Canadian ones, I did the exact same step for the pharmacy-sourced 10mg tablet made by APO. The starchy APO-made tablet began to dissolve in a calculated, but blurry starburst-like fashion. APO’s tablet was well formulated for its release mechanism of action, apparent in its spherical form which seemed to dissolve quickly and give creation to a distorted sphere with a small blue tablet in the center, which disappeared quite quickly.<br /><br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Solution Test Results:<br /><br /><br />APO Canadian made, pharmacy distributed 10mg diazepam (round, medium-blue colour, approx. 1.25mm thick with a tapered edge on either side at about 35degrees (the important fact is tha the edges were in fact tapered:<br /><br />Quick, evenly-distributed solubility is clearly apparent in this particular tablet/formulation. I believed they were legit before and after the test..<br /><br /><br />Pakistan-Made Roche Valium 10mg:<br /><br />Very slow to dissolve (1.5 hours with reamining particulate in the solution that weighed more than water). Calcium carbonate-like substance was noticeable in thin layers which seems to make the pills dissolve very slowly. Perhaps this is a Pakistani lab&#039;s way of making &quot;enteric-coated-like&quot; tablets ::)<br />I did feel the familiar effets of valium come on in about an hour. Although it seemed weak, it was probably the calcium or other hard inerts that made the pill a cheap and unreliable slower-onset time release.<br /><br />These pills were likely real, but what&#039;s legal in Pakistan should be treated like SARS elsewhere.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please research well before buying from countries like India, and NEVER buy from it&#039;s surrounding countries. India has some of the most stringent regulations in South-Asia for pharmaceuticals, but is an easy target for illegal smuggling. What you need to do first and foremost is build a relationship with the OWNER, OPERATOR, PRESIDENT, or otherwise accountable leaders of the chemical company you purchase from. Do research on this accountable figure, and familiarize yourself with Indian law, esp. in medicine, acceptable ingredients, processes, etc, and consequences for failure to comply. If you get a genuine Indian Supplier, chances are he&#039;ll operate in or around Mumbai. This is where the competition is and also a crossover of many supply chains and logistic channels. Know what you are supposed to receive, and press your supplier hard for answers if description were far deviated from your expectations. Communicate in email for record, and call him a few times to gauge his personality. Sometimes you can hear the BS in their voice.<br /><br /><br />Why Mumbai?<br /><br />Competition. And lots of it. As I mentioned, you want to make sure that your primary contact is a large stakeholder in the business and can be held accountable by Indian Law and sent to jail, as such offenses are penalized in that way in Democratic India, as they should be! If he appears genuinely busy, don&#039;t take on any financial, logistical or otherwise important business decision without the stakeholders written permission (I would go so far as to call and verify his email is legit). <br /><br />Be polite and firm, and expect them to be polite and relatively flexible. Competitive markets are great! Use them properly. If your contact is rude and forceful, tell him nicely to fuck himself.<br /><br /><br />For more information, please buy my book on Feb 6, 2013 titled, <br /><br />&quot;From Mumbai to USA.
