				Ok so I ordered a few stamp bags of dope from a domestic vendor and it was marked in transit early Tuesday and today on Saturday it still hasn&#039;t arrived! Two things to mention:2st ordered from vendor before and they are xtremly stealthy and discreet, there known for it! 2nd I notified them and they gave me the tracking number and everything and said they would get ahold of usps and figure out what is going on! With that said, I&#039;m still nervous! I haven&#039;t heard anything from the post office or anything! What should I do and does this ever happen where priority takes longer than 2-3 days?

				Lol. Just calm right down dude. Mail is not an exact science, and while domestic express will usually take about 5 days this is not any kind of guarantee. For you to be freaking out because your package hasn&#039;t arrived three and half days after it was sent is really quite ridiculous, so just take a load off, relax, chill out .. it&#039;s the weekend. Enjoy it. You should have your stuff by Tuesday.<br /><br />P.S., we don&#039;t usually &#039;hear from&#039; the post office. Typically, we just receive packages in the mail ;)

				Maybe I should have ordered Valium? But seriously it&#039;s not so much cuz I want my package at this point it&#039;s cuz I&#039;m afraid it being intercepted into the wrongs hands and me getting in trouble! I figure if I hear&nbsp; from the post office that my package is ready for pickup or they need me to sign something I will just decline! It&#039;s weird tho cuz his vendor who I ordered from is super stealthy! And I e had around 30 orders all with priority and none have taken this long so that why I&#039;m freakin out a bit!

				when i have something in-transit, that last thing i want to do is bring any attention to it. i don&#039;t check trakcing numbers and would never contact the post office. if its priority or express shipping and says 1-3 days, i would wait like 7-8 business days and then start to investigate. assuming your vendor is legit, 99.999% of the time its just a delay with the post office and everything is cool.

				USPS is the most unreliable and unpredictable service out there. They try to pretend that they have real tracking service (to give the illusion of competitiveness with UPS and FedEx) but that is just a front. Case in point, I sent a package to a state 1700 miles away and it was delivered within 3 days. I paid for express/priority/whatever it&#039;s called from within my state (less than 45 miles away from my house) and it took them 3 days to deliver it. Shit happens and sometimes things never even arrive (have had this happen to me several times ordering legit items off ebay) so don&#039;t stress, relax and enjoy the weekend, if your package still doesn&#039;t arrive after 7-10 days message the vendor and work out a resolution.

				Priority packages can sometimes take a week or more to arrive; if you don&#039;t receive it within 10 days from the date of ordering, take the order to resolution:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#My_order_hasn.27t_arrived_or_it.27s_not_what_I_expected.<br /><br />Libertas

				lol...&nbsp; The same exact thing is happening to me but my first order WAS for kpins, haha. It&#039;s been three days in my case, but it&#039;s all good. Package should be here Monday or Tuesday. Don&#039;t trip too hard... if it&#039;s an order that small I REALLY, REALLY doubt it got intercepted.
