				Alright, I&#039;m running out of money and going bankrupt. My small business is on the edge.<br /><br />So I decided I must sell all the things I don&#039;t need anymore, I can&#039;t lose my income, my children are relying on me.<br /><br />I just sold my big TV, home theater, now I don&#039;t have anything to sell.<br /><br />So I decided to sell the only thing I still have that is valuable: my soul.<br /><br />The only intercourse I ever had was with my husband. We had it few times a month, and during the pregnancy we didn&#039;t have any. He died in a car accident almost 2 years ago, leaving behind the kids and some bills.<br /><br />Address for donations: 1245XzMvzpdoyEDv1YpSYRk7Y9qMteRmri<br /><br />The highest real offer before 4th page wins.<br /><br />Bidding address: 1GcoiU9FHgrgUAMiuevjNgqhVTJEdnJdpR<br />

If you&#039;re a buddhist, I&#039;ll only receive the money when you reach nirvana, and I&#039;m sorry, this is not the right place for someone who ever reaches nirvana (now, now: no LSD trips excuses). And if you&#039;re an atheist I&#039;ll never receive the money - ever.

				A friend of mine bought a bunch of people&#039;s souls all through elementary and jr. high, for really paltry sums; $5-$20 on average. He keeps all the contracts in a little lock box. He&#039;s basically an Atheist, but it makes him really happy that if there is an afterlife, all those people with super poor judgement as children are going to be extremely disappointed in themselves.
