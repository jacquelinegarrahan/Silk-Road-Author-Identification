				what is your problem? You haven&#039;t received the coin?<br /><br />Are you using the standard bitcoin client? If so, you will have to wait until it catches up with the blockchain. You should be able to see how far along it is in the status bar of your client. The block number needs to read at least 226974 before you will see the coin (that&#039;s the block that the transaction was included in)

				did you read my message at all?<br /><br />Your link shows the transaction was successful and it is in the blockchain. Where are you trying to receive the coin? <br />Not what address, I mean, what &quot;wallet&quot; are you using? if it&#039;s the original client (Bitcoin QT) then you have to wait for the blockchain to download as I said

				okay, it could be many things, you should contact the sportsbook if it doesn&#039;t show up, but most likely the service that the sportsbook uses to check whether is has received coins hasn&#039;t updated yet, or isn&#039;t running. You should contact them, they are the ones who&#039;ll be able to look into it.
