				I am contemplating becoming a seller on silk road. I was wondering, are explosives illegal (as far as SR rules) to sell? Some of the fireworks in the fireworks section are technically classified as explosives in the US, and thus are banned. So, if I sold &#039;fireworks&#039;, would I lose my bond? Or, failing that, I noticed that chemicals are freely traded on SR. I could make a do it yourself kit, with a video tutorial included, and all the material you would need. But it wouldn&#039;t be an explosive until you put it all together. Or does SR just not want to get into anything that far illegal at all? Because I believe I could make a fair amount of money selling explosives that are either pre-made or come with everything that you need to mix together.

And what are you considering selling?

				I know there is tons of manuals, but I would offer a complete system that is ready to go as soon as you pull it out of its packaging. I would even have cell phone detonation systems for sale, either with explosives or stand-alone.

As far as the type of explosives, it would be my own formula. Well not entirely mine, somebody else invented it and I added a few ingredients to make it better. It has a shelf life of about 5 years, if stored in a water tight container.

Ask them they will know exactly. <br />I would also let people know your credentials to handle all these explosives etc.

				SynthesisWizard<br />Thanks for the help! I will contact vendor support for sure.<br /><br />a845631<br />Yes, it is very tricky. Not as far as it going off prematurely, but getting detected. When I have shipped it in the past I go through extreme precautions so that it does not get detected.
