				I was on SR for almost two years before I made any buys lol I knew nothing about computers. I heard about SR from a friend who did not know much about it or how to get on. I meet a good friend who was good with computers who showed me the link to SR and the forms. He told me to look at the forms before I tried to buy anything. I thank SR for my computer knowledge I have now.

				I had read about it 3-4 years ago by accident in a magazine article about bitcoin.&nbsp; I thought &quot;this can&#039;t actually work, give it a year and it will go away&quot;&nbsp; nope.&nbsp; over the next few years, I would hear more and more about it in news articles, hearing that the DEA knew about it, yet it was a website they were incapable of shutting down?&nbsp; WHAT!?!?&nbsp; I even went so far as to create an account at some point last year, only to pussy out / lazy out and never get any bitcoins or place any orders.&nbsp; I was smoking a lot of weed at the time, which doesn&#039;t make me the most goal oriented or motivated person, really.&nbsp; Although I love it!&nbsp; I&#039;m just a lot more likely to get rich/get laid sober than I am stoned.<br /><br />Then, about one year later (this year), I spent at least two or three months working my ass off at a legitimate job, and went without smoking weed for at least 2-3 months, so my head was pretty clear, and I was more curious and energetic than normal.&nbsp; Then, when having a conversation with a friend, I brought up the topic of ecstasy.&nbsp; I mentioned silk road, and he said a friend of a friend was getting his shit off of it.&nbsp; I told him you could find any drug you wanted at the highest potency, and that it was anonymous, but that I &quot;hadn&#039;t figured it out yet&quot;.&nbsp; He said he was going to do it for sure, claiming that people were always asking him to find rolls, and that he could sell one pill for $30 at least.&nbsp; He never took the initiative to figure it out for himself, I even offered to set up an account for him so he could do it himself.&nbsp; So I finally realized that even though I didn&#039;t understand the basics of PGP, I didn&#039;t need to use it, because SR encrypted all communications anyways.&nbsp; The next hurdle was getting bitcoins, which was easy as pie once I allowed myself to see that.&nbsp; Within the week, my buddy had a package in his mailbox with ten little pills in it.&nbsp; He was really pushing me to test it with marquis, and I told him I no longer had a test kit, but that the press had been tested as MDMA only on Edata.&nbsp; He wanted to know where to get a test kit, and I said, &quot;online dude, is the only place I have ever bought one.&quot;&nbsp; Theres not a single head shop here that sells them, and there&#039;s a head shop every 500 feet in every direction.&nbsp; It&#039;s ok to sell crack pipes and whippets, though!&nbsp; :P&nbsp; In the end, he never ended up paying me for the pills, his crack whore eated them all, and never paid a dime for them.&nbsp; Total loss.&nbsp; Seemed to be a safe haven for smoking meth at his place, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if that had anything and everything to do with why I am not getting paid (yes, n00b mistake, don&#039;t be frontin&#039;).&nbsp; And so I ain&#039;t mad, just a little disappointed., and a little more broke than I was before.&nbsp; I thought I had all the reason in the world to trust him, friend of a very very very very close friend whom I trust a lot (did I mention very close?)&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t matter how close of friends you may be with somebody, if they are a poor judge of character, then you cannot trust their associates.&nbsp; You just can&#039;t.&nbsp; Some people may be honest as hell, but that doesn&#039;t mean that their friends are too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, his loss!&nbsp; He will never see partyflocks, nintendos, skulls, bombs, speakers, question marks, mortal combats, ever.&nbsp; At least not from me, and I doubt he will get them from anybody else, or even figure SR out for himself.&nbsp; He&#039;s gonna need to pay me back in full, and then give me a really big loan for a really long time, without interest, if he wants to even be able to buy through me ever again.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll make him front $ to ME if he wants to make a purchase, and it will be shipped to his name and his household too!&nbsp; Financially, this dude is SO much better off than I am.&nbsp; He will never get fronted to again, and he will never get to hang onto product ever again, he will have to pay in full before he even SEES the shit, and he WILL be paying more than everybody else, including strangers who are only buying one pill total and try to haggle with me.&nbsp; WHEW!&nbsp; Had to get that out!<br /><br />The positive is, now I&#039;m on SR and have made several successful purchases.&nbsp; Except for the one with marthastewart, cut her molly with SUGAR, give me a refund, now.
