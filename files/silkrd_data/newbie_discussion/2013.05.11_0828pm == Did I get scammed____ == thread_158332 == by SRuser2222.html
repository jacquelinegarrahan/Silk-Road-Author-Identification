				<br />I bought the MoneyPak to BTC listing from Ramo400 and sent the MoneyPak number yesterday. Now his listings are all gone and so is his profile (when I click on his name, it goes to the send message page, not his profile. I encrypted the MP number and he sent me a msg asking me to send again because he cannot decrypt it. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anyway to check the balance on MP...&nbsp; The vendor has 100% positive fb from 40 transactions.<br /><br />Please help!<br /><br />

				It sounds like the vendor has been banned ... sadly, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be receiving anything from him.

				This is how you check the balance. Call the number on the back of the MP card, as you normally would, apply funds to your debit card. Before it is applied they will say something along the lines of &quot;To make sure, we are loading xxx amount into card ending in, xxxx-xxxx-xxxx&quot; That&#039;ll tell you if he used it or not. Also I believe if you try to activate it and he already did then they flag the card and its useless.

				If he&#039;s banned, does it mean he cannot access orders? Is it why he asked me to send the MP number again? <br /><br />I don&#039;t have a prepaid card, I&#039;ll try to go to a store to see if they can check the balance, or pick up a prepaid card. Thanks.

				Yes!&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to hear that your money is in tact!!!!&nbsp; If the vendor has been banned and all you have access to when you visit their vendor profile is a message box, then I would assume there&#039;s no way to report them.
