				Greetings everyone. I wanted to introduce myself and my product so I can start establishing a reputation. I am currently offering samples to users on this forum, with the condition that they write an honest review of my services. I will only send samples to users with high post count. Please message me for the stealth sample listing.

I&#039;ve bought a lot of coke off of SR so I&#039;d be interested in trying out your gear if you&#039;d send me a sample. I&#039;ll PM you with more information to see if I fit the profile :)

				I am a newb here also (saw your other post). Just placed my first SR order for some purple haze. <br />I don&#039;t have the qualifications that you&#039;re asking, but hey, if you decide maybe to deal with a newb, I&#039;d be down. <br />Glad I found these forums as well.

				I think one thing that can really help, especially for new vendors, is high quality pictures, with a date or something similar. As we are fairly visual based, I think you might find people will be willing to take a chance on a new vendor if there is some verification of your product, and the only way to do that aside from waiting for reviews to start rolling in is with pictures. They do say a picture is worth a thousand words. Untill you snort it all up.<br /><br />I got your pm btw. I&#039;ll be confirming for the sample once I get home. I just wish I had some coins to snatch up your deal. Your current communication leads me to believe you&#039;re in this for the long haul, so I have a good feeling about you.

				Thanks for the update snow patrol. I think some people were worried because you marked orders from processing to in transit a week ago, so they assumed their sample was never coming. What happened with the DEA? This is the first I&#039;ve heard of samplers being LE, it doesn&#039;t make sense considering no one uses real return addresses.<br /><br />Oh yeah and I&#039;m curious around how much is in each sample? Thanks and best of luck to you.

				So this guy doesnt respond or anything.. On here or SR.. Got on one day, made his announcement, hasnt come back.. No feedback on page, wont reply to me sr or here..<br /><br /><br />Im nervous with this, since hes DEA claim... and NO communication.. No feedback.. Says he has 1 transaction, but it seems its hiddin on his vendor page.. <br /><br />DONT GET ME WRNG SP, u seemed like a nice guy when u MSG me, But its not a good start to let a bunch ppl order samples, HAVE 0 communication, then show up with a MSG about the DEA..<br /><br />Little worried.. I guess the DEA would not come here and announce that though if they wanted ppls addresses etc to look into, knowing the alphabet boys will make pppl scatter in 1 sec or less. lol

				Chill out, anyone can order something off here, and the main thing is that if EVER questioned about some mail, always deny ordering it, and for samples, I think the DEA have bigger stuff going on such as South Americans with planes, boats, maybe subs carrying tons of coke to the west. They have more armoury than the Taliban and would not think twice anout killing LEA.<br /><br />Snow Patrol should send out his samples - and the claim of getting a request for a sample of coke off LEA obviously has others worried over his motives for having an account here. <br /><br />If you gave you home address in - and are that worried - just search for any paraphanalia and stash it. <br /><br />Maybe he just snorted it all&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Some must buy a vendors account, get an ounce of cocaine and end up chasing chicks in the bar or watching Les porn for two days running.<br /><br />I once fell victim to a similar thing when a Canadian with a vendor address gave out maybe a couple of hundred samples. Only afterwards, we realised that hundreds had given out addresses to someone who just vanished, never got seen again.<br /><br />Thats why its always best to have a drop address.

				So, does that mean no samples were ever sent out? Or is it as you said a page back and samples were sent out to all who were confirmed on Tues?

				i&#039;m interested to see how this all pans out now as i have been following the thread since its opening lol<br />so you said in your message that all samples were sent the day before the 12th? i&#039;m looking forward to the reviews!<br />you can set up your pc to use at home without risk. you still shouldnt store your product where you use your computer imo<br />if you set it up so you boot your o/s from a usb and keep all your software like tor, browser, encryption, gpg4usb, etc.. on your usb as well, your pc will be completely safe incase of a seizure. just have to make sure you hide your usb stick. personally i like to keep all my passwords on a hardcopy piece of paper stashed in another area away from the usb. its kind of like storing your guns and ammo separately. never store them on your pc. if you do this there will be no trace that your computer was ever used to do anything with SR from my understanding.

				Well, at least he&#039;s replying, that&#039;s good.&nbsp; And he has been on SR recently; also good.&nbsp; And for first class, it is not really late yet; also good.&nbsp; So let&#039;s&nbsp; hope for the best and keep everyone informed here as orders - hopefully - start to arrive.

				Hi Silvr,&nbsp; That was simple enough.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do the same and report back the results.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind losing something on the purchase, I just want the outcome to be fair and reasonable.&nbsp; I want &#039;the system&#039; to work.&nbsp; So if I paid 40 dollars, didn&#039;t get anything and then got back most of my money I would be satisfied.&nbsp; This is one of those &#039;learning experiences&#039; on SR.&nbsp; I was brought in by the good prices and sample-sized ordering portions, but I hadn&#039;t done research on the fellow.&nbsp; There were some enthusiastic &#039;reviews&#039; by people who allegedly bought from him but they sounded like shills in retrospect.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should have exchanged several messages with him in advance to get a feeling for the fellow before purchasing given the limited number of sales he had made.&nbsp; I think what someone else said, i.e., that he &quot;got in over his head&quot; is probably what happened.&nbsp; &nbsp;If everyone who bought his &#039;coke&#039; and didn&#039;t receive anything got back most of their money - that would be a happy ending.&nbsp;

				Instead of giving away samples I would suggest selling samples (1/4 gram) for a very low price (perhaps at your cost), limited to one sample per person.&nbsp; That way more people will be able to sample at a reasonable price and it won&#039;t cost you anything.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get plenty of reviews and boost your credibility.&nbsp; You can also state what the cost will be after the discounted samples are sold.&nbsp; I know from experience that I can&#039;t trust reviewers very much.&nbsp; I have very high standards and I am almost always disappointed by the quality.&nbsp; But if I can sample at a very low price, if I am disappointed at least I will not have lost much money.&nbsp; Do you care to share with us in this thread what you have, what price you&#039;d ultimately like to sell at and what you think of the coke you have for sale.&nbsp;

				5 to 10. Small enough sample size to be enjoyed once or twice. <br /><br />Also pick at least 50% of the people on the reliable reviewer&#039;s list. Otherwise you may not get reviews in return. <br /><br />Reliable reviewers: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=117957.0<br /><br />And be sure to only do it via SR and make listings for it. You can charge for shipping or a nominal cost like .01BTC. But totally free is best. Because what you are getting is a 5/5 for the transaction on your account and you&#039;re also getting a review in the forum. So think of it as an advertising expense.

				Hi weok83r8fd,&nbsp; I suspect that the well established vendors who sell decent product do a lot of business.&nbsp; You could certainly write to a few and see what they have to say.&nbsp; My experience buying coke on SR is that practically no one carries decent coke.&nbsp; If your coke is really good, and if you are getting it direct I presume it would be, you could fill a niche for outstanding cocaine which I don&#039;t think anyone really fills currently.<br />You could also initially offer your coke at a discount just to get purchasers and as these people review your coke and you become established by having a decent number of purchasers you will develop a reputation.&nbsp; <br />You can raise your prices once you are established.&nbsp; You can even include this information in your listings.

				My order just went to resolution.&nbsp; I will update here as to what happens.&nbsp; I am copying below what I wrote in the message section of the resolution request.<br /><br />Never received product. Sent 2 messages but never received a response. If you look at the thread on the forums devoted to Snow Patrol, you will see that this has been the experience of many who ordered from Snow Patrol. <br /><br />The forum thread is here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166943.90;topicseen<br /><br />Did not receive anything and no communication.<br /><br />I was considering cancelling my order but Snow Patrol put it &#039;in transit&#039; before he had sent it (or much more likely, he never got around to sending it)<br />I asked Snow Patrol about this and he said when he put it &#039;in transit&#039; he was only &#039;confirming&#039; the order. However, this is improper. &quot;In transit&quot; means<br />that the product has already been brought to the post office and mailed.<br /><br />In short, I don&#039;t think Snow Patrol knows what he is doing. I see that he has finally taken down his listings.

Giving that selling coke brings in a good bit of pocket money, I know for a fact that some vendors are simply too tempeted by that white powder! In real life, the dealers are almost always users and its the use of certain drugs that lead to a sloppy job.<br /><br />In my work (legal, 8 - 5 shit) we banned coke! We could not rely on people coked up and due to certain aspects of the work being potentially dangerous, we made sure that nobody turns up bouncing up and down with enthusiasm. Also, if your snorting coke in the morning you got a problem. Coke is treat not a daily medicine! Using too much always turns people into a mess. So, some vendors here. I&#039;ll lay my last btc on it, will simply be doing what real life coke dealers do! Use too much and mess up the business. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying Snow Patrol is sitting behind closes curtains snorting his way into a heart attack or psychosis, in fact, if the guy says he is in hopsital, maybe he actually is! And if most customers are in escrow, then the only worry is that your unable to get at that btc until the 17 days passes. Been there, frustrating but fair system and 17 days is about right.<br /><br />So if you are in hospital, hope you get well soon.<br /><br />Also, some vendors will go through things that they cannot publicise. Deaths in the family, family crisis, even a dead pet would make me take a week off work. <br /><br />And when ratings go down, it does not mean the vendor is dishonest. It can mean a lot of things. But, if your a customer who has ordered and not got then maybe you don&#039;t give much thought to the vendor and expect everything to be sent out as if they vendor was Walmart or Amazon!<br /><br />I always allow that 17 days, will message at 15 if its not there and extend the time. <br /><br />There are things that happen to all of us which would mean we would be out of action for a few weeks. A family death for instance, for a while at least, I&#039;d not be thinking too much of work. And if in hospital, you might not be in a fit state to send a text message let alone get onto the hospital network (if there is one) and message SR.<br /><br />I think every vendor needs a partner to cover for them really. Some of the big vendors are obviously teams, others, like I say its a one man band. In that case, you might see rating plummet. However, I&#039;ve seen some hit 70 and below and bounce back again. Hope snow patrol does that - for him/her and for the customer of course. <br /><br />And, for now I&#039;d take them at their word. But I&#039;d not FE and I guess anyone who has is pretty pissed off. Juist bear in mind, the guy/girl might be ok soon and back on track. Happens all the time. Like football players who go through a bad patch. <br /><br />So, get well soon!<br /><br />Or if your snorting too much yayo - remember the old rule and don&#039;t get too high on your own supply!<br /><br />I think getting high on your own supply is a bonus IF you use recreationally. Bash it every so many weekends, not daily.<br /><br />Whatever is up - hope it levels out soon. You can take a 70 and rise up again to high 90s.<br /><br />Only coke dealer with 100 is bungee54, but he is out at the moment.<br /><br />Bloody coke! I&#039;m glad I&#039;m a bud/hash guy myself. Not worth doing coke and smoking the UKs finest bud and Atlas2012 hash! Cannabis will level out that cocaine high - wipe it out with a few joints actually. So don&#039;t smoke before or during any use of coke. More value for money that way! And leave out alcohol. It creates a poison when mixed with cocaine. 90% of UK&#039;ers will continue to buy coke and head to the pub/club and drink like a fish. Waste of money. Enjoy cocaine for what it is. <br /><br />Hope all you guys and girls owed something either get a refund or a resend.<br /><br />Hope Snow Patrol can throw up a quick coms also. But, he/she might not be reading this.<br /><br />In real life, complaints to coke dealers are usually not as polite and civil as here on SR.<br /><br />A complaint to some guy on a corner ius likely to provoke them to answering the complaint with a baseball bat and obscenities relating to your mother. Accusations you may be father to your own brother. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad that on SR at least, even if you get ripped off, at least your in one piece!
