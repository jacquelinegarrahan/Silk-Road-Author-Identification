				Hi all!<br />I need help, I transferred 3.21 bitcoins from Bitstamp to my Silk Road address 13ru8fuwYT6PB4LC23pTpZiHxqwt6tv7rK.<br /><br />According to https://blockchain.info/address/13ru8fuwYT6PB4LC23pTpZiHxqwt6tv7rK, the bitcoins I sent to 13ru8fuwYT6PB4LC23pTpZiHxqwt6tv7rK should have arrived at the destined address. when I check my Silk Road account it still says they haven&#039;t been received!<br /><br />Where could they have gone? What should I do?<br />Thanks in advance.

				There&#039;s some kinda fuck-up on SR&#039;s side with transferring bitcoins right now.&nbsp; They told me it should be sorted &#039;soon&#039;. They also recommend generating a new bitcoin address for each purchase to stop this happening in future.&nbsp; Transferred my coins yesterday at noon and still nada. If I miss my 3pmEST cut off for my regular dope guy today I&#039;m gonna be a hurting motherfucker by tomorrow so I&#039;m hoping they figure it out asap....

				Hey dude, not too much experience with this, but the first time I transferred it took about 8 hours. I could have swore I&#039;d put in the wrong address lol.<br /><br />How long has it been since you transferred? Maybe sit tight and not worry too much if it&#039;s not been that long since you did the transfer.

				yeah, from the SR support guys:<br /><br />We&#039;re working on a small issue with archived addresses at the moment; to avoid this in future, please always use a new address for each deposit.<br /><br />Apologies for the delay - it&#039;ll be fixed as soon as possible!<br /><br />~SR Support<br />
