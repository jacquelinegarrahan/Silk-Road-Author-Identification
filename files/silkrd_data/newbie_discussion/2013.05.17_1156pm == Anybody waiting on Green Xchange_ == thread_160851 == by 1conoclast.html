Your order has been processed and should arrive within a couple of days. Let us know what you think when it arrives.&quot;<br />5/13/13<br />&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to thank all of our customers that have been so patient with us as we dealt with our technical and shipping issues.

Should you decide to order through us again, we will be adding a good bit extra to your order free of charge. Now that things have been handled we can assure you that your future orders will be delivered with the same speed as before.<br /><br />We are truly very sorry for all the delays.

				I also have been waiting. Ordered the 4th marked in transit on the 5th. Have not received yet, it&#039;s the 18th today. He did respond to 1 email I sent him asking when did he get it in the mail around the 10th. After he sent the mass email to all his customers. He responded to my email&nbsp; apologizing and said I would receive it early this week which would have been the 13, 14 or 15th. I emailed him again on the 16th letting him know that I still have not received and asking again when did he actually ship? No response but I can see that he read it. I emailed again last night, the 17th letting him know its in resolution ( I did not FE) no response and no view on the resolution page. <br />Thank you for starting this thread!!!

				It&#039;s possible that he has a ton of email from all customers who have not received. He should send out another mass email if he is unable to respond to all of us.

				Still nothing in the mail. I don&#039;t know what to think??? ??? He&#039;s still checking in and hasn&#039;t totally disappeared. I don&#039;t know why some people think they sell cocaine to the masses with anything less than a Kilo. They probably ran out of product. (This is pure speculation) . Why would you lie and say it&#039;s in transit and you don&#039;t have the product??.BTW-Lexq(Canadian Vendor) is a legit&nbsp; and a pro. Gonna go back to him as soon as this fiasco is dealt with&nbsp; &nbsp;

				TheGreenXchange is also on the forums. Active too. Why he still has customers feeling screwed I have no idea. If he is active on forums he should have time/sense to email his customers with $ in escrow. Link to his posts on forums: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=55282

				Thanks Jasmine13. I bought a gm from Lexq about 3 weeks ago and still have it. I don&#039;t binge. 2 lines and I am good for hours. Funny thing is I only want to sniff when I want to chill out. That&#039;s how good it is,very mellow very smooth. I was going to compare products, but I guess that aint happening now. I&#039;ll keep up with this post and keep everyone informed

				Anyone get a successful 100% refund resolution out of TGX yet? Just curious... as I just entered into resolution too.<br /><br />TheGreenXchange has come up in the official scammer call-out thread, so just a caution to anyone thinking about ordering.

				&quot;TheGreenXchange has come up in the official scammer call-out thread, so just a caution to anyone thinking about ordering.&quot;<br />Damn! Thanks for the heads up Jenso! So glad I didn&#039;t FE!!. I&#039;m in resolution now. Day 4 and I don&#039;t even think he has viewed it!! So will this resolution reflect bad on my buyer stats?! NOT COOL if so bc it has nothing to do with me!!!! &gt;:(<br /><br />Growdan, I wanted to try bungees but the listing was down. Marco, I would be comfortable with an order from lexq but im US and he&#039;s Canada. Would prefer to stay w/in US. <br /><br />So I went with an 8 from PureO. I&#039;ll update on my experience and quality here. <br /><br />Im glad im not the only one going through this BS w/ TGX. I&#039;ll keep you all posted on that too. Good luck to you guys and cheers!!&nbsp; :)

				IMHO buying from Canada is like buying from the USA, almost. It will tickle you BLUE when you see his stealth if you do decide to go with Lexq. I&#039;ve had no issues from the Canadian vendors I&#039;ve used thus far(MIMM,Lexq). I wouldn&#039;t advise anything overseas,though. I contacted Festivalia from The Official Scammer Call out thread via PM since I didn&#039;t have enough post to do it myself to let these guys know whats going on. I&#039;ve tried 2 USA vendors with coke and both times it was a swing and a miss. I&#039;m here in the USA as well
