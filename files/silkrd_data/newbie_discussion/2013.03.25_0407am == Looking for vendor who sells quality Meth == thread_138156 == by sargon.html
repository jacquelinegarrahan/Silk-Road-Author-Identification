				It can be very batch dependent on what the actual make up of the gear is which in turn will effect the pharmacology of it...<br /><br />from memory 80/20 d-meth/l-meth is good horndog juice but trying to get accurate info on the batch held by the dealer is often a wasted venture. By the time you get any info that is verifiable the batch is done and the next is different.<br /><br />the meth vendors thread here on the boards can help narrow the field but again it can be a luck thing that you get the same gear that anyone else does..<br /><br />Beyond that what country are you in as it will dictate any recommendations I or anyone else will make.<br /><br />Oh and I actually use SR as my exclusive source for all thing drug like.. Still have the RL contacts and keep them happy with a random customer here or there but have found this place to be exactly what I want/need and easily as reliable and consistent as elsewhere. More so in many ways as a matter of fact so I think the generic question about where to get xx drug is more to do with the group mentality and the safety in numbers primal survival mindset and l4ess about having tried all the ones available and not being happy.&nbsp; Peoples lazy desire to be walked through every aspect of the daily grind by those more capable and competent is also a factor behind them perhaps. Hey may even be LE casting a net to see who the best targets are this week... :-P

				I kinda of figured that about the chemistry, both the composition and the lack of info a supplier will have. I have found the vendor conversation on the rumor mill section to be a little disjointed and difficult to digest. Thank you for the 411. Also I am not LE (not that it matters if I say so but still I aint)

				yeah man I was just trying to point out to the derp asking about why people ask these questions the silliness of the question asked and the assuption they made from the questions being asked..<br /><br />lol that&#039;s a twister right there but yeah.. pulled the LE thing to break it down to same level of idiocy so they could understand it.. Lol they didn&#039;t have anything to say that would go to an answer to you question and still thought it appropiate to ask a question all of their own ..<br /><br />anywho...<br /><br />honestly can say I&#039;ve had a good hard on from most of the gear I&#039;ve gotten here but, assumed from the 411 comment, as you are in USA I would suggest ;<br /><br />Kush411 <br />Hammertime<br />Topgear<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />SamGarcia (think that&#039;s the right name?)&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&lt;---- if he comes back, IF, don&#039;t use him.<br /><br />^^ hit the end of his road in a spectacular way making off with substantial financial benefit from what I can gather.... dodged that bullet by millimeters waiting for coins to confirm and then opportunity to get on the site and order. Luckily was offline a couple days and when I returned the deed had been done. sympathies to anyone who lost coins and apologies to anyone that was led to him by this post. The lesson to be learned is that FE should be reserved for the coins you can afford to loose and the squeaky clean, never, not even once had a issue with extended delays/personal issues etc.<br /><br />Replace him with <br /><br />DubG&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;-------- not a great communicator, not the fastest shipping times but the absolute best meth I have ever had.. I have had my fair share over the years... and about 20 other peoples fair shares and this is markedly different, better looking/tasting/burning and cleaner in the high that anything I can recall. Legs that go all the way up and make a cunt out YOU too.. if your not careful that is! very easy to go for days on end without realizing it and missing too many meals to be able work it out.<br /><br />and not in that order necessarily... they are the top vendors from anecdotal evidence and with them you will at least get top quality gear even if its not the horn inducing goodness you seek.<br /><br />lol@ the Meth thread being as it is.. who would have thought we tweakers would produce such a random and disjointed creature.. <br /><br />;-P

				Check under the &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; section of these forums, there is a different thread discussing good vendors for almost every drug on the road.
