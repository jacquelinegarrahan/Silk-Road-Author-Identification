				Yeah this looks like a scam. From what I understand (I may be wrong) Silk Road take a cut of the price of an item, so that feedback costs nothing to create. Also there&#039;s no way to use escrow there.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d use one of the clearnet services rather than this place, find someone on #bitcoin-otc&#039;s web of trust and deal with them directly.

				Thanks for the advice. I am not actually a complete newbie, but I never heard of #bitcoin-otc before. Good stuff!

I have done multiple deals with a vendor who charges 3%-5%. The only problem is they can&#039;t always do the deal if they don&#039;t have someone lined up to get a reload card. Just now I PM&#039;d them about a $500 Vanilla but they don&#039;t have a buyer until Monday. They are completely legit.

				What&#039;s the reason a vendor would be offering the coins 1$:1$ via western union? for instance.. it would cost 5025$ to put 5000$ on your account via western union but, To put 5000$ on there at 5.9% fee through a bitcoin agent equals 278.56 FEE. So that&#039;s saving a good 250$. <br /><br />I thought maybe thos was to avoid cash paper trails, also get cash faster to avoid the fee&#039;s of withdrawing via a middle agent(2% to sell).<br /><br />Does SR charge vendors to withdraw? Or only the 15% per sale? <br /><br />I have a vendor who i think i trust but i&#039;d like to think he made something out of this making it worthwhile, having to go to western union all for a bit of quick cash and no trail? kind of seems worth it.<br />
