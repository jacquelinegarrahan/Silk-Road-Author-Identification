				...does anyone else find people who only smoke weed to have a superiority complex over other users? I&#039;m not saying all of them are like this, but the amount of people I see spreading bullshit misinformation about other drugs is shocking. These are the same people that throw a hissy fit every time a retard says marijuana kills brain cells, and here they are saying E puts holes in your brain.<br /><br />If you partake in the use of an illegal drug, who are you to judge?<br /><br />Actually, no matter who you are or what you do, you still have no room to judge.<br /><br />Tl;dr hardcore stoners who don&#039;t do other things are judgmental assholes more often than you would expect.

				I&#039;ve got to say, I have seen this a fair bit. Mostly its just pot-heads saying its &#039;all-natural&#039; so better than &#039;chemical drugs&#039;, but some people I&#039;ve met absolutely hate any drugs other than weed, along with anyone who uses them. IMO, what you put into your own body is your choice, and nobody else should judge you for it.

				We should all be free to do what we will.&nbsp; Somebody trying to explain the health reasons why something shouldn&#039;t be done is a very weak argument since who are they to dismiss what another humans finds to be enjoying or therapeutic.&nbsp; One person&#039;s main objective in life may be the experiences they have as opposed to living until they are 100 years old and have 20 grand kids.&nbsp; Although I love weed, I wouldn&#039;t think it to be wise to compare it to water.&nbsp; Although I smoke weed all day/every day, it is still a mixture of chemicals which most of us then heat and inhale.&nbsp; Just because it grows in the ground doesn&#039;t mean that it is being used/abused in a manner that different from most other drugs.&nbsp; Maybe a little less science involved but hell, I think most of us smoke much higher potency weed due to other scientific knowledge and processes.&nbsp;

				Ever notice how weed smoking seems to attract the younger players? Older dudes still do it, but from my observation not to the same extent. I guess that applies to sex too.&nbsp; ;D

				What I noticed in my area is there&#039;s a new generation of smokers that are all into the medical shit now that it has become widely accepted. I also notice a lot of these medical users will look down on your regular ole pothead which annoys the shit out of me because I deal with these people a lot and they piss me off but at least they&#039;re willing to pay for quality and not bitch about how weed used to be $30 a ounce. <br /><br />

				Nothing but free time when you are young which is great for both.&nbsp; A little easier to go to class looking/smelling like you just smoked 10 bowls and still get better grades than your peers than it is to do same and go to a real job.&nbsp; Even if you are a high functioning smoker, most employment situations would still not be cool with that image unfortunately.

				Yeah, although the medical community has done a lot for those with illness and in helping end some misconceptions or falsehood about the drug, I have noticed that it has flooded the streets with weed hipsters which are the worst.&nbsp; You can normally find them explaining to you how great their &quot;medical hydro&quot; is the best bud on earth and how they could probably hook you up sometime.&nbsp; I love asking them about the price they paid.&nbsp; They always have a reason why it is totally worth spending $350 an oz to buy.&nbsp; They always crack me up since they are normally the same people that bring over a single bowl when smoking&nbsp; because their bud is so good that you don&#039;t need more than one bowl; well that is, until you start loading more bowls because these suckers are too stupid to realize they are smoking the same bud that you have at -$100 less.&nbsp;

				this is a funny debate, however where i&#039;m from there&#039;s another factor that has been totally left out here so far; alcohol.<br /><br />So the song goes something like this:<br />&quot;alright, so i drink every weekend but at least i don&#039;t smoke weed&quot;<br />&quot;yeah, i smoke weed once in a while, but at least i don&#039;t drink my brains out or do crack&quot;<br />&quot;i&#039;m not an addict, i just like drugs.. so what if i drop a pill once in a while?&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;ve probably heard someone use at least one of these sentences, or maybe even used some yourself... So let&#039;s play the blaming game, shall we? :)<br /><br />Alcohol fucks with your liver and can make you agressive ... and some has experienced these &#039;black outs&#039; where you wake up the day after with a guilty concience of some kind.<br />Weed makes you dumb, just straight up slow, yes, that might sound exaggerated, but the longer you keep smoking the dumber you get, and the smarter you&#039;ll feel when you&#039;re high. (i&#039;ve been down that road)<br />mdma/xtc is a hell of a ride, but if you&#039;re doing it too often you suddenly can&#039;t produce any serotonin naturally, for those who dunno what this is, it basically means you can&#039;t achieve this mental state many would refer to as being happy.<br />Speed, coke, heroin etc.. never tried it, and honestly don&#039;t know anything about it, but there&#039;s plenty of side effects up in this level as well when the high has worn off...<br /><br />lets see.. nicotine, yaaay.. makes you look cool, gives your lungs a nice dark tint and it&#039;s probably the most socially acceptable drug for others to mock people with. :D ..i have no excuse for smoking cigarettes, and i would quit if it wasn&#039;t so damn hard, hehe..<br /><br />ok, ok.. so everyone likes to think they&#039;re better than others, yes, infact you all suck for not sharing my opinion!! (that was a joke, i&#039;m very open-minded) ..and people naturally use the defence &quot;but at least i&#039;m not doing.....&quot; to make them feel better about their own nasty habits ...what do you usually tell yourself/your friends?<br /><br />but in the end everything we enjoy will kill us, whether it&#039;s nicotine, cocaine, sugar, pineapples, because no human has enough self control to be able to resist those spontanous actions.. and if you actually can resist ALL temptations i believe you&#039;re missing out.. What&#039;s the fun part about living all those extra years that healthy people claim they will if you can&#039;t just let go and enjoy yourself once in a while?<br /><br />tl;dr ... fuck you! scroll back up and read it, now! :D
