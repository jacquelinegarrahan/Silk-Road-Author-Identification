				Its called coinmama.com<br /><br />It makes me nervous for several reasons, and I was curious if anybody has ever used it or knows any additional details as to its legitimacy and security.<br /><br />As a newb, I am currently playing the waiting game with MtGox and was hoping for a way to expedite things.

				If it makes you nervous, then why not avoid any possible issues and use a legitimate, well-established bitcoin business like Bitinstant or Blue Sky Traders?

				&quot;expedite things?&quot;<br /><br />1) Go to Bitinstant and follow directions.<br />2) Drive to Walmart, CVS or whatever closest location is (stop by ATM first)<br />3) Fill out blue form (or use red phone which I&#039;ve never seen)<br />4) Profit<br /><br />I&#039;ve only done this twice so far, but the coins were in my SR wallet waiting for me when I got home. I&#039;m not sure if it always works this smoothly, but it did for me. I think I paid about 10% in total fees. I just think of it like paying sales tax on my droogs. YMMV<br />

				BitInstant - best way to go, though I have heard some good things about coinbase.com&nbsp; if you wanna give out your bank acct info.&nbsp; If your just making a cash deposit to BUY BTC then i&#039;d use bitinstant.&nbsp; If you wanna w/d into a bank acct, check out coinbase

				Bitinstant is the way to go. It&#039;s simple, reliable and fast. My deposits have only been taking a few minutes before they are available in my wallet.

				Just wanted to update, but coinmama did come through for me. <br /><br />However, I did want to thank everyone for the recommendation of bit-instant. After looking over their site, it does appear to be the best option. <br /><br />
