				Hey <br /><br />So, a member here recommended I use bitfloor to buy bitcoins anonymously, but unfortunately, it seems they are shutting down! <br /><br />If I understand correctly, on bitfloor I would have deposited money in person into my bitfloor account (associated with a tormail account) at a Bank of America or something, then I would have bought bitcoins with my newly deposited money, after which I would transfer them through 1 or 2 throwaway bitcoin wallets before finally transferring them into my SR account. Is this correct?<br /><br />Question is, what&#039;s another trustworthy website like bitfloor where I can buy bitcoins anonymously?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Why do you need to buy them anonymously and have throw-away wallets?

				You&#039;re making it too hard.&nbsp; If you want some coins in your SR account, do what I did.&nbsp; I went and bought a moneypak card at walmart and then went on SR and bought coins through coinXchange.&nbsp; I had my coins in less than an hour, and he only charged 4%.<br />

				I&#039;m just cautious like that. I&#039;m only on here to buy personal quantities of stuff, but I want to ensure that I&#039;m being discrete and anonymous regardless. Perhaps I&#039;m exaggerating the risk (probably am), but I still want to be as safe as possible. <br /><br />As for the wallet transfer, I head that just makes it harder to be traced. I could be wrong about that.

				safety is the best way but being over cautious can also take away from the experience.&nbsp; I would say what is the safest way is by being educated. Read, read, and read some more.&nbsp; Knowledge is power here and that will be the safest thing for you to do.&nbsp; Cover your tracks and get your bitcoins from a reputable source and if you&#039;re super paranoid pay some extra change to use a bitcoin laundry service.&nbsp; They can be pricey though.&nbsp; Also get several (at least 2-3) wallets and transfer different increments around before you transfer to SR and vice versa going out.&nbsp; I think the best TOR is pretty good at keeping you anonymous but it&#039;s still possible to leak your data.&nbsp; Like I said just start reading and don&#039;t stop, you can never know too much!

				Yea, I just impulsively wanted to buy some stuff for personal use, didn&#039;t feel like spending days setting up multiple accounts etc etc... but sometimes i&#039;m not very patient.<br /><br />If there is any way to trace anything back to me, I don&#039;t see how.. but im not an expert.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t see why any law enforcement would bother with a national investigation to catch someone who spent a couple hundred bucks when there are people shipping kilo&#039;s all over the place.&nbsp; Im pretty sure they&#039;re more concerned about the suppliers.

				I&#039;m having trouble with PGP as well. coinXchange has a tutorial posted. I just check it out - it seemed to clarify things a bit. <br /><br />Are any of you familiar with BlueSkyTrading?<br /><br />Problem with coinXchange is that they won&#039;t accept anything below $200. I&#039;m not even trying to spend that much, not right now anyways.

				I didn&#039;t want to spend 200 bucks either... but once I got on and saw the prices, 200 doesn&#039;t go all that far.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I think if you want to use coinxchange, and want to stretch your money, its a good idea to wait for the price of coins to drop a little and then when you have your coins... wait for them to increase a bit before you spend them.&nbsp; That way you get the most bang for your buck.
