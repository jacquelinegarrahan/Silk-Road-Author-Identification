				Pure MDMA is white, but even a few percent impurities can turn it tan to brown, which doesn&#039;t make it weak. I&#039;ve had strong tan MDMA.<br /><br />Read the reviews, since they will be more informative than the color.

				What MDUK said.<br />But marquis test only tests if MDMA is present. Its doesn&#039;t accurately represent purity numbers. But others may believe reaction time and how violent it is suggests higher quality.

				I&#039;ve found the tan to be more intense, speedy, and long lasting, while the white is more &quot;lovey&quot; and not as long lasting. For concerts, the tan is the way to go, for home rolls, I&#039;d go for white. At this point though, we&#039;re just being picky, as long as it tests great you&#039;ll have a good time.

				I am biased towards white MDMA, simply because i have a high quality vendor that supplies me with it.<br />My friends don&#039;t seem to like tan or brown stuff because of bad experiences, but as said above, color is no guarantee of purity.<br /><br />If you are really intrepid you can clean brown/tan mdma yourself to make sure you have the purest product possible. out of my league though.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45508.0<br />

Arrives as big chunks that look like crystals, but when you cut it, it kinda crumbles like rock-salt.

				No scientific knowledge for me..<br /><br />But from reading around, white is washed better. With that being said, I&#039;ve had both white and tan. Tan was definitely on par with the white..<br /><br />It&#039;s retarded but I like the white better strictly off looks..&nbsp; :D

				MDMA in its purest and best synthesized form is nothing but crystalline white in appearance.&nbsp; Any other color is garbage left over from the synthesis that can range from virtually anything as those other chemicals get oxidized.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any other color is dirtier but not a direct indicator of quality per se without a GMSC.
