You can send me a pm to cut down on the traffic that your brain receives while one scrolls through so much wisdom. <br /><br />Clearnet warning. I am really stoned! reader beware!<br /><br />I do take this very seriously, as I do all aspects of my life, however. I cannot be without the presence of humor, even if it does seem simple and crude. =)

				am new to this and just desperate to get things going, just seems to be so much hoops to jump through until you get there, i guess it just to keep everyone safe but gets a little off putting for someone like myself who not totally upto date with this kinds of technologies....anyway cant wait to finally get everything figured out and receive my first order :)

				This place is awesome isn&#039;t it. Just please, for the sake of all of us. Be as careful as you can. SR is unprecedented in human history. We can buy any drug, at super high quality, safely, without fear of being robbed or shot. Just remember that it&#039;s up to all of us to be honest, consistent, and to NOT GET CAUGHT, and if we do to NOT RAT PEOPLE OUT, and this fantastic experience that is SR will last. And when we&#039;re 80, we&#039;ll be able to sit naked by our computer and order the best drugs. <br /><br />Happy shopping.

				Congrats &amp; enjoy! One suggestion I have is Bitfloor for BTC&#039;s. Very straightforward &amp; no ID&#039;s required, but you need to be near a Bank of America to deposit cash as the easiest option for small fee. I just got an account today - you just need an email. Another is Ziggap (sp?) which if I recall correctly uses Chase banks.

				Congrats and welcome to SR :) I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be sticking around for a long time. It is pretty awesome don&#039;t you think? <br /><br />I&#039;ve not made that many orders here in total, 5 if I remember right, but each of them was either a spectacularly good deal or I got extra, or astonishing shipment times, or great vendor service, or in most cases all of those.. Beats street dealers for sure :D
