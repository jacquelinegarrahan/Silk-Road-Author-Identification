				Looking at all the cola on SR and lots of really pure stuff makes me think I may want to give it a try. Trouble is I know nothing about it. It won&#039;t be a common thing cause it&#039;s expensive but wondering if anyone can offer advice. Just curious if one buys a gram of fishscale, how do you prepare it for insufflation and how do you know how much to do? How long would a gram last or should I buy 5? Want to have a good time and not end up in the hospital. Any other tips or advice on what to expect?

				just look at the reviews of said product and buy yourself half a gram or a full one, I find a gram of fairly good stuff lasts me the night. I had a gram from ukdoctor at the weekend good price solid stuff, not rocket fuel blow your head off but a good hit better then a lot of the shit out my way.

				In my very limited experience, I&#039;ve learned that a great majority of the &quot;pure&quot; coke on SR is anything but. Be careful and do your homework before going with a vendor. Order small first to sample. Though I have also run into vendors sending great samples and when you go back for more, they send lower quality stuff even when they say it&#039;s from the same batch.<br /><br />As far as how to goes, I&#039;m far from an expert and will check back for any tips that anyone else leaves, but make sure it&#039;s dry, chop/grind it into as fine a powder as possible, and start out really small. You can always do more, but once it&#039;s in your system, that&#039;s it. The better the coke, the less you&#039;ll need. And with coke in general, you get a better effect with smaller amounts spread out and redosed periodically. A lot at once just gives you a headache. Small, match sized lines. Start with one. Go to two when you know how you&#039;ll react, then another every 30 mins to an hour.<br /><br />Another reason to start slow with EVERY batch is that until you test it with an EZ test, you won&#039;t know the quality or if there are active cuts. Your reaction can differ every time. It pays to play it safe and will make it much more enjoyable.<br /><br />More experienced users feel free to correct me and/or add as you see fit.
