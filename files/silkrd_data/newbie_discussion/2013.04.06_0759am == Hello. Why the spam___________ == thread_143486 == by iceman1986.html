				Sup everyone I&#039;m obviously new to this forum if you couldn&#039;t tell.&nbsp; I&#039;ll get straight to the point why are there so many spam threads? what is the point of having the 50 post rule if everyone is just gonna spam anyways.

				Well people want to talk about certain things on certain boards which get overlooked here, so it&#039;s kind of self explanatory. Get to it ASAP so you can save time. I haven&#039;t found the newbie discussion to be all that amazing so far but there are much better topic to read on the other board.

				As MaestroVendor has stated, it is to prevent spambots from being able to plaster the forums with spam. When they are kept here they are more easily eliminated and the other forums are not affected.<br /><br />We&#039;re currently discussing the possibility of cleaning up the Newbie forum; it has evolved into more than just a place to contain spam, so depending on the direction we receive it may be a more pleasant place to spend time in in future.<br /><br />Libtertas

				I am trying to make an even balance of proper posts and &#039;bump&#039; posts in order to reach 50. I desperately want to post in the Australian forum, which I am unable to do so until I get to 50.... hence the spam post.

				Yeah I think spamming is really stupid. The only people that post in those threads hit 50, make ONE post, and leave forever.

				Yeah I just spent an hour spamming 50 messages so I could go ask for .02 BTC<br /><br /><br />Well atleast now I am at 50 and can post everywhere. However, being a long-term buyer on SR, I have always wanted to post in the forums and finally can. So happy. <br /><br />Now if I can just swing the .02 btc since my last vendor is taking way too long on an order, i need to make a overnight order now so i dont get sick.<br /><br />Woot!
