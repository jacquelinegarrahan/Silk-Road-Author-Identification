				Do you still think of me the same? Would you know my name, if I saw you in Heaven?<br />I know you&#039;re there. Taunting me. Telling me to be a man. You weren&#039;t a good father. But you keep whispering for me to MAN THE FUCK UP SON. MAN UP. That&#039;s all you say to me in bits and pieces.<br /><br />Why are we doing this dance? Do we dance to remember? Do we dance to forget?<br /><br />ON YOUR FEET SOLDIER. PUSSIES DONT MAKE GENERAL. PUSSIES CANT DEFEND THEIR FORT.<br /><br />I am trying. I am wealthy. Don&#039;t hide, don&#039;t hide, DONT FUCKING HIDE. The deadline has passed.<br /><br />I want what is mine. Don&#039;t be foolish. The tears are blood are just Christ reminding us of what he did for me. For us. For you. For thy neighbor.<br /><br />What is going on? Redrum. Redrum. Redrum<br /><br />If I don&#039;t get what was stolen from me, I&#039;m your worst nightmare motherfucker. Now wash out your filthy mouth whore. Little whore.<br /><br />Magic :)

				No, I am His servant. I am His servant, and I see Serpants abound. I see them.. they see me.. and we will do this dance to eternity. But I am hurt, I am sad, I am hurt today. I&#039;ve been slandered. I&#039;ve been put to the fire. But I have training. TACTICAL TRAINING to WITHSTAND THE FIRE, WATER, AND EARTH. My unit was on the ground doing things that would make most people throw up in their mouth. And all I wanted to do was vend in peace.<br />In Peace I shall. But the question remains, Vend? or Rest? <br /><br />Leviticus 20:9<br />For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
