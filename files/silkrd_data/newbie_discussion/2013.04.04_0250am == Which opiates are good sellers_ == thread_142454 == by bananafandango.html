				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Since I am new, I cannot post in the other areas that are dedicated to this kind of question, so any assistance from the community would be great! I&#039;ve been perusing the site for a couple of weeks now, and I read the forums. I am still left with a few questions that I hope you guys can help with.<br /><br />I am considering becoming a seller here, and I have a steady supply of Oxycontin 10mg and 20mg (OP) by Purdue Pharm. as well as Morphine Sulfate 30mg ER tabs. I am hesitant to lay out the $500 bond before getting a feel as to whether or not these will sell well. <br /><br />I may be able to get hold of another opiate as well if I ask for it.&nbsp; If so, what sells well?<br /><br />Do 10mg and 20mg oxy tabs even sell? Is there something that people want more than that?<br /><br />Thank you for your comments and thoughts on this. <br /><br />Peace

				Trying to bring my post back to the top. I wonder why I haven&#039;t gotten any responses yet. <br /><br />I know, we are likely all new on this board, but perhaps someone has some insight somehow into what sells well. <br /><br />Is it likely to be fruitful to become a seller with what I have? What do you guys think?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Yeah, I think the OxyContin will do pretty well, they are always in the highest sellers, MS not so much, but it will still sell a fair few. Opiates do okay on the road, Heroin is by the far most sought after though.

				Thanks for your input--much appreciated. Too bad the doc can&#039;t prescribe the heroin. Interesting. I thought that the MS would sell better because it can be crushed, while it&#039;s more of a process to separate the oxy from it&#039;s time-release function. I do think the oxy is MUCH better taken orally, for sure. <br /><br />Anyone else? What do you think?

Where I&#039;m from, they prescribe OC&#039;s so it&#039;s all good. If you have a steady supply and wanna take the chance then get a vendors account, offer some competitive prices and away you go :)<br /><br />Best of luck to you whatever you decide to do.

				Thanks, Ranchlands. I appreciate your thoughts. <br />Does anyone care how many mg each tab are if the price is adjusted appropriately? I mean, if I sold eight 10mg tabs for less money than one 80mg tab, would that be attractive to buyers? Or is there something &quot;better&quot; in people&#039;s minds about getting a single pill versus several?

				Ohh that&#039;s a tougher one. Hmm, I&#039;d personally rather have the 8x10mg for cheaper as I&#039;m not a huge opiate user. But then again some would rather have 1x80mg due to the decreased chance of getting caught in the post.<br /><br />Tough one that. Sorry, I&#039;m not much help haha.
