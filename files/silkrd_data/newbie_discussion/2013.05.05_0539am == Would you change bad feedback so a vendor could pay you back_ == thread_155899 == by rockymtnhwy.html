				So I haven&#039;t been around SR very long, but I have been around long enough to have a bad experience with a vendor. As a newbie, I expected vendors to ask me to finalize early since I didn&#039;t have a purchasing history. I bought some pills, some blow, some more pills and FE&#039;d with no problem with several vendors. (Thanks to vendors: Vicodin, Dragoncove and Peels4U!)<br /><br />I went to buy some pills from a different vendor and he asked me to FE. Now this vendor had a 98-99 rating at the time, and he seemed to have a long history of being honest, so I didn&#039;t flinch when he asked, since I assumed my transaction would go as smoothly as his previous sales. His vendor page proudly declared that he would send me the tracking number. He told me &#039;the mailing label was printed&#039; and my product was going to the post office as soon as I FE&#039;d. After four days of nothing in the mail I sent a message asking for the tracking number. Two days later I get a cryptic message about &quot;needing to explain the whole situation&quot; to me. I then noticed his vendor page was updated that same day with a tepid apology about overselling on his product, and how he had refunded all the people who had bought product he didn&#039;t have in stock. All the people &#039;cept me.<br /><br />So SR goes up and down and up and down for a week, but I manage to sneak in a make some successful orders with other vendors. I send the &quot;over-sold vendor&quot; messages telling him to refund my BTC, and give him several virgin wallets he can deposit my $200 in to. He can always send it directly to my wallet on SR as well.<br /><br />Mind you, SR was down for about 4-5 days, but this fella has been avoiding me for 10 days. Whenever he does contact me it&#039;s always platitudes about how he wouldn&#039;t screw me over, yada yada yada, but he always ignores the part about refunding my BTC.&nbsp; I finally get fed up and go change my initial 5 rating to a 1, since that seems to be my only recourse after finalizing early. Then another customer of his leaves a 1 rating the next day, telling the same story about FE&#039;ing with this guy.<br /><br />So after another 5 days of nothing, I track the vendor down on this forum. He explains to me that the two bad feedbacks have ruined him, since he&#039;s now in the low 90&#039;s and not the high 90&#039;s. He won&#039;t be able to sell anything now, and that has screwed him up financially. He then asked me to change my feedback so that he can make some sales. He didn&#039;t come right out and say it, but I read between the lines and see that he needs to make some quick sales to pay me back.<br /><br />I have this gut instinct that I&#039;m either going to get screwed again, or even if the vendor does pays me back, it would be with dirty BTC that he basically stole from some other SR customer.<br /><br />So I pose this question: what do I do?<br /><br />Do I stand my ground and insist the vendor pay me back first, and then change my feedback to favorable? Do I cut my losses after 2 weeks and just let my feedback stand and give up hope on my $200 being returned? Or do I cut the guy a break and change the feedback, hoping that I get paid back sooner while just kicking the proverbial can down the road?

				Say you won&#039;t change it back to &quot;5&quot; until he refunds you. Then don&#039;t actually change it.&nbsp; ;)
