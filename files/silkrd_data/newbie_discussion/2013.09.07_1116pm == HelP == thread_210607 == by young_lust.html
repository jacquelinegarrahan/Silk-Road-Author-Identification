				Come on! <br /><br />Why don&#039;t you write something so people know what youre buying and why you need the help?<br /><br /><br />This would be like throwing money on someone who dont even care about letting you know where the money will go. People dont know if they want to support what you plan to do with the money, right?

				thats nice , I kinda believe you to..<br /><br />Im broke tho since slaveprivileges aint for me.<br /><br />if you get $60k then you are probably a very famous one and your owner gives you huge slaveprivileges.<br /><br />with that much money i can&#039;t really figure out how you can be broke tho since anyone you know would probably lend you money if you can pay it back soon.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck with this and I wish you the best!<br /><br />peace

				You wrote 6,0000 tho.. Should I know that youre slaveprivileges are smaller or should I know you placed the &quot;,&quot; in the wrong place.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care man, i think everyone now knows if youre worth donating money to..<br /><br />You seems to have a warm big hart and much love in it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t hate you man, I care to much about myself to hate you.<br /><br />to be honest i think youre a heroine addict and you would have got some money if you was honest about it since people know how hard that is to be without. Shure the drug you wrote is probably also terrible to live without, or maybe not.<br /><br />You wrote that you basicly need drugs to be able to get some pussy and I don&#039;t know who would pay your drugs so you can get some pussy.<br /><br />But you have a warm hart so maybe somone will.<br /><br />Anyway take care man and good luck with your anger and the beggin for pussy and drugs and money.<br /><br />Peace!

				Because any community surrounding drug dealers and bitcoins (let alone both) is rife with assholes and scammers and beggars and junkies.<br />You don&#039;t know anything about me, I don&#039;t know anything about you. <br /><br />I recommend changing the title of your thread to (help with money)<br /><br />That way you won&#039;t get anyone angry when they&#039;re trying to help someone who isn&#039;t just begging.<br />That&#039;s all.<br /><br />(50 posts yay)
