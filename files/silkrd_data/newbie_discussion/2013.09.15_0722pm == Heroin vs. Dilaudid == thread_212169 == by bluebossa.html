				Hey folks...can anyone help me out with some info?&nbsp; I&#039;ve long been an IV dilaudid user, who is going to switch to heroin for a little while (won&#039;t go into the reasons; I know it&#039;s not ideal, and it&#039;ll change my tolerance, but, that&#039;s the way it goes...)&nbsp; An average shot for me is 10-12mg of hydromorphone...can anyone recommend a good starting test dose of H, and a good vendor (in the US) from whom I should get started?&nbsp; (I know, of course, not all H is created anywhere near equal, and I will certainly err on the side of caution with an even smaller dose than what&#039;s recommended...I was just trying to get a sense of ballpark equivalence with regard to specific vendors, from people who&#039;ve experienced their product...also, I know there are much larger threads devoted to heroin dealers, but, if anyone had insight about a dealer that might be good TO START WITH, or good for someone who&#039;s used to dilaudid, that&#039;s more what I&#039;m looking for here...and also I&#039;m still under 50 posts, so I can&#039;t jump into those threads with this question yet anyway...)<br /><br />Thanks!!!

				It depends on how many 10-12mg shots of hydro you do in a day.&nbsp; If you are doing 10 shots a day then your tolerance is fairly high.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done both.&nbsp; To be honest I never felt much from 8-12mg of hydro.<br /><br />If you are going to IV some H, I would start with around 50mg.&nbsp; Dissolve it into 2ml of sterile water, enough for two syringes.&nbsp; Do the first one slowly, stop about halfway for 10 seconds to see how it&#039;s hitting you, then finish off.<br /><br />If after 15 minutes you don&#039;t feel too much from the first syringe, do the second.&nbsp; My guess is you will need a bit more, as hydro is something like 2 times as strong as H.<br /><br />Just go slowly and you should be OK.&nbsp; Don&#039;t pile shot after shot just because you don&#039;t get a rush the first time.&nbsp; Wait 3-4 hours and then try hitting a full 50mg if you don&#039;t get a rush off the first 50 divided in two.

				Thank you, Captain Jojo!&nbsp; Very helpful and considerate response...yeah, on a day off, without much going on, I can comfortably go through 7-8 shots in a day, so, I guess I do have a decent-sized tolerance...again, will always keep doses on the smaller side until I&#039;m comfortable, just to be safe, but, that at least gives me a decent idea...also, I&#039;ll likely be ordering #4 as opposed to BTH (since I&#039;m less sure about measuring and prepping tar), so, with that in mind, if it&#039;s a pure-er product, should I avoid heat altogether (just mix with sterile water/saline and filter)?&nbsp; Or do I want to heat a bit regardless?&nbsp; Thanks again for the response--as far as I&#039;m concerned, the more information, the better.

				That is a answer less question as it depends on the strength of the gear some i can get and iv 250mg other 50mg so the best is to start small and work your way up<br />you know the old saying better 2 holes in the arm then 1 in the ground
