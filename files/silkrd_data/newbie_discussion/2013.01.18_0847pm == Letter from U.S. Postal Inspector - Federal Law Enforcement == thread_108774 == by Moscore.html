				*I made this new forum account to protect my identity* <br /><br />Ok so because I don&#039;t have enough posts or something, I cannot start a new thread in the Security sub-forum for whatever reason so I&#039;m posting it here.<br /><br />About a week ago a package from the vendor Just4u2nv (100) was being sent to my destination. All location information was sent with PGP encryption. I have ordered from this vendor before and the packaging was next to best.&nbsp; But this time, something had to be different. because this is what I got in the mail instead of my package.<br /><br />This is the letter as it reads word for word (replaced some information for identity protection):<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />United States Postal Inspection Service<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Date: 1/15/2013<br /><br />My Name<br />Street Number/Name<br />City, State, ZIP<br /><br />Subject: Detention of First Class Mail (Express or Priority)<br /><br />The Purpose of this letter is to advise you a parcel addressed to to or sent by you is currently withheld from delivery as there are reasonable grounds to believe its contents are non-mailable, and possibly in violation of Federal Law, specifically, the Controlled Substance Act. Our attempts to contact the send or receiver to obtain additional information have been unsuccessful thus far.<br /><br />The parcel is currently being held at my office. If you want to claim the parcel, please call me at (###)###-#### so mutually convenient arrangements can be made for this purpose.<br /><br />If we do not hear from you or the sender within thirty days of your receipt of this letter, the parcel will be deemed to be abandoned, and it will be disposed of in accordance with U.S. Postal Service policy. If you have any questions concerning this matter, or do not understand the reason this letter is being sent to you, please contact me at the above listed number immediately.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><br /><br />Officer&#039;s Name<br />U.S. Postal Inspector<br />Federal Law Enforcement<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />So, now I don&#039;t know what to do. Should I use a different name when I&#039;m ordering? Can I even send anything to the address this was sent to while it being safe?<br /><br />Please Help!<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I would definitely second the get a new address idea.. I just use P.o boxes for most small non-weed orders. And as always make sure you use the REAL NAME of a usps listed receiver at whatever address you do end up using.. they look for things like some guy going by the name of &quot;Shady McBizdrugz&quot; lol<br />

				I mean was the letter you got postmarked from where the vendor ships from? There was a scam elsewhere a while back where the vendor sent out seizure notices instead of product, then offered partial refunds (shared risk of seizure).

Yes, the letter came from where the vendor ships. But, the letter came from an envelope that was first class mail with postage and fees paid for. The return address is the United States Postal Inspection Service (I google maped it). So I don;t think its a scam. He&#039;s sent packages to plenty of others (including me) and stealthiness was not a issue. I have contacted the vendor about this and he says the cause of this is not his lack of stealth packaging but rather because hes sent out too many parcels at one time, therefore, flagging his packages. He said he now knows to&nbsp; break up parcels and do multiple drop points for shipping dates. The vendor is being very kind and offering a 50% bitcoin refund or 100% reshipment. But I dont see how the reshipment is going to be possible unless I find a new address.

				In addition, I&#039;ve looked up the officers name. (which, by the way, she doesn&#039;t sign her full name). Rather she up First initial, last name. Just print. No signature.

				Sounds like he just made a mistake then. BUT since he admits it was HIS mistake and not a random interception, why then is he only offering 50% refund? I know that if I make a mistake that causes my customers to not only miss out on delivery, but also have their address possibly flagged, 100% refund seems the least that could be done.

				Okey dokey, well just in case don&#039;t take the 50% refund.. just have him try to reship if he has figured out his problem.. with proper precaution<br />you wont get prosecuted as the receiver, you&#039;ll just get another letter. Remember, they are watching him, not you so much.. how big was the order?

				It was 7 grams ($350) of BHO wax. Not that big of an order but it was all personal. And damit, I just want to get my smoke on lol. Just4u2nv seems to have the most legit wax on the road.

				Mmmm can speak for the USPS but the Royal Mail in UK sometimes have random sniffer dogs at depot locations.<br /><br />I dont know if you can do this in US, but if I were in your shoes I would hire an annoymous mail PO box and have stuff shipped there.&nbsp; Always change the name on the order, and never use your real name.&nbsp; If questioned then you can just deny knowledge of it, and say it could have been sent to the previous owner of the box.&nbsp; If caught with the mail then just say you have not opened it, you just picked your mail up.&nbsp; Stealth on the part of the vendor is paramount.<br /><br />In UK our drug laws are a little relaxed.&nbsp; If you are caught with a small amount of weed for personal use, you are OK and nothing happens.&nbsp; Get caught with Class A drugs like Charlie, and you could go down the steps, depending on the quantity and quality of the drug

				I am glad I saw this because I couldn&#039;t post and I haven&#039;t got my post count up.<br /><br />My package was intercepted as well from him. I got two letters, one certified and an identical one that was normal. I had to sign for the certified one. I looked into this and it doesn&#039;t matter if you sign for the notice. Just don&#039;t try to claim/accept the package in any way.<br /><br />They were identical and same as yours. Package detained, call xxx-xxx-xxxx to claim it. <br /><br />Here are my thoughts and what I have gotten from research. <br /><br />1. The address is on some list somewhere now. <br />2. Don&#039;t get a re-ship. I got a full refund. <br />3. Your address isn&#039;t fully safe but also not completely condemned. <br /><br />Personally, I am going to stop ordering from said state for at least 6 months, maybe more. Seems like with recent legislature and more freedom, they are cracking down more on exports there. <br /><br />I honestly have no idea how wax could have been intercepted without packaging error. My previous order from him was perfect but it was quite pungent once the vaq seals broke, especially for wax. <br /><br />Honestly this is just more paranoia that we don&#039;t need. According to the letter, if no response is received, they will get rid of the packages in 30 days. So we just have to sit tight and look into an option of getting an alternate drop point. Personally, I don&#039;t have this luxury yet but I am looking into a PO box.<br /><br />They don&#039;t usually go after the receiver, and you can just claim complete ignorance if they ask anything. Hopefully this won&#039;t happen again since he has the best wax selection on here. <br /><br />Quick note: I got another order from another part of the country with no issue. So I don&#039;t think your mail will be personally inspected or anything. They seem to focus more on the source rather than trying to see all your mail. However if another seller slips up and your name comes up again and the same inspector sees it...you may have some unwanted attention coming to you.<br />

I got 2 letters as well. one certified, one normal. saying the exact same thing. If you are saying this as well and then I am not so worried. Now this sounds like the postal service was suspicious of his activity and how many parcels were being sent out from that single address. The vendor is now offering to reship with a different postal service to avoid being flagged by USPS

				Honestly, as long as its a personal order, I would say that with no recourse you could use the same address, although i would certainly order a dummy package up though before anything gets sent to that address again.. I don&#039;t think the govt is going to hunt you down like a dog over some wax... Also though you should get another address if possible (which it is).<br /><br />The vendor is the one who needs to migrate to a new drop location.. If anyone he is the one who will be pursued. If you get a new address or po box but your vendor is still on the same pattern they are gonna keep seizing his goods..

				Honestly, and I&#039;m a pretty cautious sort.. I think you&#039;ll be fine.. USPS is awesome because of their warrant requirements, on the other hand.. 1/4 zip of wax is not worth prosecution, so private carriers would likely be aceptable..

So much tasty goodness down the trash. Plus the seller lost big on this one, he definitely needs a new drop off point. <br /><br />As far as being relieved they don&#039;t come to your door...it&#039;s not a surprise really. We aren&#039;t talking bulk here and these amounts couldn&#039;t be justified in LE time and effort. At least I hope they don&#039;t waste their fucking time like that. <br /><br />I researched and the people getting busted on the road are huge exported and importers, recently in Australia. LE doesn&#039;t want everyone gone, just the big players. So I think we can breathe easy as receivers of small, personal amounts.

				Ok so I&#039;ve been talking to the vendor and he is being very kind and understanding. Now, he is offering to reship the package using UPS and have the package &quot;released by sender&quot; meaning I don&#039;t have to sign for it and the shipper accepts liability for any loss or damage done to the package after it has been delivered. Sounds like a good compromise. I wanna go ahead and give him the OK to do it but I just want thoughts of what other people would do in this situation.

				The guy definitely needs to move. I think one properly packaged order will be very difficult to intercept, even via private couriers. As long as the seller takes good care and caution then there shouldn&#039;t be any problems. <br /><br />My theory is that one batch got pinched from one drop point. Either it was the quantity or a small rip, something made them detain the packages. <br /><br />The sellers doesn&#039;t use a real return address, so no way to know who dropped it unless they have surveillance which is unlikely for the under-13oz drop boxes.<br /><br />Also, a question to all the pros...what&#039;s the best additional address service to use?&nbsp;

				You&#039;re definitely tempting fate.<br /><br />Your address will be flagged by USPS, and I have to imagine they share with other major carriers. Perhaps a private courier service could be employed?<br /><br />If you could get a friend to agree to let you send it to his address (offer to share!), that would be pretty win. If it makes your friend feel better, offer to be the one who comes by and picks it up. Just have him call you when it arrives, he never has to touch it or have it inside his property.<br /><br />

				It is definitely safe to say you will need to use a new address. As they say, better safe than sorry!

				You should ask for the 50% bit-coin refund,take the loss, you should call the postal inspector and deny the fuck out of it. if it was being sent to a Po box then i don&#039;t know what to tell you. Its gonna look weird if you don&#039;t call though. i would get a new address or a Po box using a friend that&#039;s cool with it(let them know whats being shipped that way they know to deny it and not say it was intended for you if it was intercepted again). If you decide to use a po box you or your friend should just recieve regular mail for a few months( sign up for coupons and free catalogs so your box stays full,) also try to get a medium sized one and order some things from the web ( ebay or amazon) then i would send a dummy package or two that was similar to the vendors first packages that made it thru.

				I just received an identical letter, except that my order was for an ounce of weed. I was already refunded for the purchase so I&#039;m not upset about that, but I&#039;m just debating whether or not to call the postal inspector and deny or to just ignore everything and let it go away.

				Thanks for the good insight, guys. I agree with the logic, which is mainly why I didn&#039;t even call in the first place. Thinking about it now, they have one package, thousands of miles away from me, I really don&#039;t need to be involved at all, because the letter explicitly states that after 30 days it will be considered &quot;abandoned&quot; and will be disposed of. <br /><br />The only reason I even entertained the thought of calling was because of the idea that if I explicitly denied the package, they couldn&#039;t prove anything and wouldn&#039;t waste their time with a controlled delivery, though I suppose if they were going to do a controlled delivery they would have never even sent me a letter at all.. However, now that I think about it, I&#039;ll have plenty of opportunity to deny the package on the 1% chance that they do end up attempting something. <br /><br />Either way, my address is definitely in time-out for awhile.
