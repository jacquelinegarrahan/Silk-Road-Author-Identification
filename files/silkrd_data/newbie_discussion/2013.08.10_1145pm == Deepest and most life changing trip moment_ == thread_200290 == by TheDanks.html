				so last night, we were drinking some Jameson Whiskey and trippin...BAWLS...on some good CID. My friend D used to love jameson, he was drinking it they night they crashed and he died not too long ago. So we killed it and I threw the bottle way up in the air and it shattered. And I walked over to it and just stopped for a long time. It was like he was the bottle, and he died by shattering. And the little glass shards left over are the little memories we have left

				My most lilfe changing trip moment was not quite so deep.<br /><br />There were two moments for me, both on mushrooms.<br /><br />The first was when I was trying to stop a mate from climbing up a tower. I don&#039;t think he would have jumped but... Anyway after an argument about it I was suddenly blessed with the realisation that no matter how many friends we have in this world we are utterly alone. This might sound depressing but it wasn&#039;t - it was liberating. I climbed the tower with my mate knowing that if something happened to e it is my fault, if it happened to him it was his. Since then I have taken full responsibility for my own life and let no man stand in my way.<br /><br />The second was not long after this. I played bass in a fairly prominent band in the late 90&#039;s. For the main part our drugs of choice were heroin and weed but one Saturday afternoon we decided to go mushroom hunting and got shitloads (from the garden of the local high school no less!). We cooked them up into cups of milo and drank and drank and drank until the moon looked like the sun and the night became enlightenment.<br /><br />Then we laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed.<br /><br />Our drummer, C, had been in a fight the night before and had a broken cheekbone and jaw. Our guitarist, B, decided that playing Guns n Roses song &quot;sweet child o&#039; mine&quot; would be hilarious. Sadly for C, so did he. If you&#039;ve ever seen someone with a broken jaw laughing it is a funny but sad sight. Poor bastard was crying in pain while laughing his ass off. Our singer, D, somehow controlled the mood in the room with a stick.<br /><br />It was a very good bonding experience for us as a band. The next week we recorded our best selling album which I don&#039;t htink would have been as tight if not for that night.

				Everybody should have a psychedelic experience at least once in life. We are genetically predisposed to it - we&#039;ve been tripping since we came down from the trees of Gondwana and I don&#039;t think you have a REAL understanding of your own self unless you&#039;ve been on the other side of the mirror.

				I cannot attest to anything on actual psychedelics. However, I have had a deep experience on MDMA and marijuana with some of my closest friends and I realized everything in my life would work itself out in the end and stuff and that all of us were really good friends and shit (don&#039;t feel like typing out everything).&nbsp; That summer was the best summer of my life with those friends and it&#039;s sad that almost 3 years later some have become wrapped up in drug addiction, died or just drifted apart but I will always remember those friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />Planning on using some mushrooms soon for introspection to hopefully have a life altering trip.

				I didnt start taking lsd til college and one night I was standing on my balcony and all the stars were sending beams of information back and forth to each other.&nbsp; It gave me a sense of universal communication.

				I&#039;ve had some pretty deep trips.<br />Mostly on shrooms, but everytime it usually involves me being faced with the true nature of my actions and how they affect others. Looking at myself and finding out how truly selfish and self centered of a person I really am. It&#039;s easy to brush that stuff off and forget it ever happened but when you&#039;re tripping and you put yourself in a situation that brings out the worst in you, it&#039;s hard not to look at that and really tear yourself apart over it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some good trips and some bad. but they always end up positive.<br />The one thing that has stuck with me since I&#039;ve tripped is to become more aware of my actions and how they may affect others and to try my best to go to bed each night with a positive attitude and outlook on life. Simply letting go of the past and all the bad things I&#039;ve done is something I have to remind myself of this every day, but it&#039;s as simple as looking out the window and just being grateful for what I have been given.
