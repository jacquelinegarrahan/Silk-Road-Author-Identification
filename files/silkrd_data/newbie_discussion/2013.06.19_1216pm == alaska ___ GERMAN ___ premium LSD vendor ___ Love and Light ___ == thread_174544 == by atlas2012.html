				Alaska, you rock bro. <br /><br />I ordered the promo special 10x tabs from alaska and recieved them quickly - 7 days from Germany to the Northeastern USA. Excellent service, great stealth.<br /><br />I finally got the try out the good this past weekend at a music festival campout. I&#039;m a burly dude and have a pretty high tolerance for most drugs, and I took 2 tabs / about 240 ugs. The body high came on strong and surprisingly fast - I&#039;m usually waiting around about an hour before I start feeling anything, but this hit in about 20 minutes. <br /><br />Not too much longer, and I was having the most fun I&#039;ve had on LSD. I&#039;ve had about 10 trips in my life... I always have a pretty good time, never had a &quot;bad&quot; trip... but often my trips have a more spiritual and introspective nature... this time it was just plain fun and I was laughing my ass off and dancing like a goofball. I got some visuals. I remember the girls with light-up hula hoops looking like they had galaxies around their wastes. I was watching the tree branches overhead dance around and the lichen patterns on the trees move.. but overall the visuals weren&#039;t particularly strong with this trip for whatever reason.. and that didn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />The head space was really awesome. I was talking to a girl the whole time (who is on antipsychotic medications that unfortunately block psychedelic effects for her so she couldn&#039;t join my little journey) but she was getting a kick out of all the ridiculous shit I was saying. I kept having weird funny ideas and she laughed her ass off with me. <br /><br />The peak experience lasted probably 3 or 4 hours, hard to tell because my sense of time was all fucked up. <br /><br />There was a good while after that - maybe another 3 or 4 hours, where I laid down in my tent and closed my eyes and simply listened to the &quot;music&quot; of the crowds around and outside.. and started having really interesting aural hallucinations where I could hear the undertones of people&#039;s voices and campfire guitar playing that was breaking out all around.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ordered again to take advantage of alaska&#039;s great price while it was still lasting. I have another crazy weekend of party time and spiritual journeys coming up soon, and I&#039;m happy to find such a great vendor. 10/10 experience. Thanks a ton alaska!

				This was me and my girlfriends first experience with the silk road. As im sure you can remember, we were very hesitant and skeptical that this would work but we figured it out and began our search. The 10 hit pack with promo price was what caught our attention. After a little research we figured out these guys were real deal and apparently had another vendor account where they are reviewed TOP notch across the board, Atlas2012 crew.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We received our package 6 days after we placed our order!!!! Ordered on Saturday afternoon and received following Friday morning on West Coast, USA. Very small and discreet stealth packing, would have no concerns in the future about my order being seized by customs/authorities. We were also very delighted when we discovered that a free tab had been thrown in our order saying WELCOME!!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having a little experience with LSD when i was a teenager (now a young adult) I didnt know what to expect considering this is supposed to be top quality and for all I knew I was getting complete garbage when I was younger. This was to be my girlfriends first LSD trip :D She is an experienced user when it comes to MDMA though so she went into experience with very little hesitancy and much excitement. After about a half hour after we both dropped 1 tab each we went on a walk to kickstart our trip, body high began to come on pretty strongly but not to intense for the mind to handle. We could not stop laughing as we were walking and listing to music, after about 30 minutes into the walk we both began to have good visuals, street lights were very vibrant and headlights became as bright as the sun. It was at this time that we decided to retreat back to our house and begin the fry! Once we got home we put on some good music and the visuals got INTENSE. My whole wall and tv were being stretched and morphed sideways and up and down, my girlfriend said my short hair kept fluffing into a giant afro and my face would get squished up and down and I just looked ridiculously hilarious! after about 1-1/2 hours of playing with music we turned on the television. The visuals continued to remain very strong but shifted from that wavy morphy style that usually comes with music and over to bright and vibrant visuals and colors, altered and sometimes shifting patterns. Pawn Stars kept us entertained for about an hour, very quirky and funny, at one point they were playing with a hot rod some guy was trying to sell and it looked like a tiny hot wheel! I still don&#039;t know how they were sitting in it.... So we dropped at about 9:00 and at about 12:00 my girlfriend wandered upstairs and I began my favorite part of the trip, the introspective exploration of your brain and space and time :) Keep in mind the body high has been very very pleasant all night long and continued to stay pleasant untill trip was over, without it getting to intense and overwhelming at any point through the night. Anyways exploration time was very clear, had so much fun with my thoughts i can hardly keep a smile off my face now as I think about it. After I wandered for an hour or so up and down the stairs hiding candy and cannabis everywhere along the way to keep myself entertained as the night goes on, self induced easter egg hunts are the best on LSD, I found myself back upstairs with my girlfriend having deep and introspective conversations untill about 3 or 4 in the morning which is when she went to sleep. Her overall first time LSD experience was WONDERFUL, and you guys made sure of it with your top notch quality product! I was awake untill about 7 pm watching my drywall morph and continuing to play with thoughts. VERY clean high, after only a few hours of sleep we awoke refreshed, not sore, and clear headed. We have given some to a few friends and everyone agrees that 1 hit is absolutely amazing. very good stuff you will NOT be disappointed. I took 2 hits the other night as well and spent first few hours watching the back of my eyelids, Rest was spent watching avatar which if you havent done, you really should. Amazing visuals and very easy story to follow with several different scenes invoking thoughts about many different subjects <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall very good experience with this vendor, this is our guy. We wont be going through anyone else what so ever
