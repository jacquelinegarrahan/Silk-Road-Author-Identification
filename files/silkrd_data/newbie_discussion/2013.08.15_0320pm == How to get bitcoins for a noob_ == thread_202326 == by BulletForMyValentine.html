				Hi, I&#039;m 16 and I find all this bitcoins nonsense a bit complicated. Cash in the mail is the easiest option I guess. I can&#039;t do bank transfer simply because I&#039;m not 18. I can pay by visa card, that&#039;s if any websites sell them of course.<br /><br />Please help me x<br /><br />BulletForMyValentine

				If you give your credit card to a website then you&#039;re going to get screwed.<br /><br />Kids buying drugs gives the politicians ammunition to maintain harsh drug laws.&nbsp; If you are living at home you shouldn&#039;t be receiving drugs in the mail or have drugs at home anyway.

				Dude, your brain&#039;s not even fully developed yet. I know that sounds patronising but I didn&#039;t even touch weed til I was nigh on 18 and judging by the fuckups I know who were cutting class at 14 to get baked that was an excellent decision. <br /><br />Also, there&#039;s not a single drug in the world that makes Bullet For My Valentine&#039;s music sound good ;)

				I could get bitcoins for you without taking any fee, just for goodwill, I will need physical cash, cause im planning to buy more bitcoins myself, therefor if you figure out a safe way to do this (for your own safety) then please PM me.

				First of all, you are young, so please consider holding off on drugs for now.&nbsp; At the very least, consider holding off on anything other than MJ.&nbsp; I was at a fest recently, and there were a bunch of girls who were probably no more than 15-16 coming super close to whoring themselves out for drugs, and it was fucking awful/pitiful/disheartening.&nbsp; I know not all you youngsters act like that, but it can be difficult to stop doing something that feels good when you&#039;re an adult, let alone when you are still developing, and that shit can have an effect on how your brain develops.<br /><br />Also, please consider that getting anything illicit sent to your address while you live at home with your parents can have a profound effect on other people.&nbsp; Imagine if your parents opened a package for you and found some drugs.&nbsp; They&#039;d probably be mad, right?&nbsp; Now imagine what would happen if you get a controlled delivery and all of a sudden there is a team of cops in your living room scaring the shit out of your family because you got drugs shipped there.&nbsp; Not only are they gonna be pissed, but you will have caused them significant fear, pain, and anguish.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; And don&#039;t get me started on how you would fuck up someone else&#039;s life by getting something shipped to them...<br /><br />Now that I&#039;m done lecturing you (but trust me, even though I don&#039;t know you it is because I give a shit about you growing up to be a normal, decent person), I&#039;ll give you a real answer:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Edited to delete because clearly you are too immature&gt;&gt;

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone is so hateful to teenagers on this site. This is the best place for them. They&#039;ve got every right to take some drugs if they want to try them out, and better they get quality product stealth shipped anonymously than having some seedy twat rip them off and try to hit on them or their girlfriends. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;All this crap about their brains, are any of you developmental psychologists? I&#039;ve been taking drugs since highschool and there&#039;s nothing wrong with my faculties. Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me the nurse is saying it&#039;s time for my electro-icebath therapy.
