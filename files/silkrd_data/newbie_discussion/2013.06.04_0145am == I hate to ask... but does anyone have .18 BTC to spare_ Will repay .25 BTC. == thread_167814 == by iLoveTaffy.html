				But it&#039;ll be on the 1st of next month. I don&#039;t get paid until then. =/ If I had a way to give you actual USD, I would. But I don&#039;t want to pay gigantic fees for buying such a small amount, and have to go out of my house yet again.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m .18 short. v_v<br /><br />Also, since .18 BTC is worth about $23 right now, and .25 is worth about $31, I will AT LEAST return $31 (if not more) on the 1st of next month, regardless of how many BTC it is.<br /><br />Thank you. PM me for my SR BTC address if you&#039;re willing, and thank you so much...<br /><br /><br />P.S. Totally understand if this isn&#039;t allowed. Just close the thread and warn me and it&#039;ll never happen again. Thank you, guys.

				Money sent. Good luck and I trust you will repay it. It&#039;s nice to build this type of relationship with one or two others so we can help each other out when this happens occasionally.

I will refund (plus interest) on the 1st or sooner. I will send it, PM you, then update this thread.<br /><br />If in the future YOU are hurting for BTC, just send me a PM.

				Sorry to say this user is not trustworthy. Oh well, he&#039;s young and I&#039;m only out about $18-25. He contacted me saying he was about to repay me 2.5 weeks ago and then went dark, no long logging in which is unusual for him. I hope he&#039;s well and everything is ok, just posting so others don&#039;t loan him money at this point. <br /><br />He is 8 days late.
