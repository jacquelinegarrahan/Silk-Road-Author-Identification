				I have checked several guides. The one I had I closed on accident and cannot find it again. I think I screwed up though....I made a Mtgox account after I got torbrowser and what not. I made it on my pc from just firefox. I have not figured out how the getting the bitcoins into that works, then wallets and then to here. I can go to walmart using bitinstant, and give them my mtgox acc#, but. I have read that I do not wanna do that? <br /><br />I have pgp I have truecrpyt installed and a partition set up and what not. I am using pgp too. I am getting hung up on the safest most efficient way to get bitcoins then to get the coins into SR. I think I am going to have to make a new Sr account too. I do not remember ever getting a pin... someone please slap me, then baby step me through this please.

				I guess I was hung up on encrypting. I have the usb set up with liberte and what have you. Now I guess my question is, do I access the silkroad through that, instead of the torbrowser on my man drive? Also, do I want to truecrypt my actual C drive and usb with truecrypt?

You may want to have a truecrypt container on your USB drive to store persistent data (not terribly familiar with liberte). The point of the USB drive is not to use your C drive anymore. So, no, you don&#039;t need to encrypt it, just get rid of what&#039;s already there and don&#039;t use it anymore when doing these activities.

Either way, if you&#039;re going to persistently store keys and such, it should be encrypted one way or another, either by liberte or in a truecrypt container. Not encrypting it kind of defeats the whole purpose because if someone recovers your USB, then they have all the keys right there for them. But yes you will need some way to store your keyring.

				Okay. I have finally figured out this part. I think.....I am running off my flash using liberte. which is linux, I could not find midion on this os as I have used some sort of windows version for 12 years. I did the torcheck and I have the same screen as when I was using the torbrowser download from my regular pc. I have a little yellow onion on the bottom right corner. I have found that have a pga built right in and I love that. It&#039;s all on the flash drive I am using. no trail to my computer other than my fuck ups trying to get here. <br /><br />I thank you for your patience. I just wanna do this properly. There is not a whole lot of room for error.

Take a look, it may help :<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124191.msg851179#msg851179<br /><br />Best of luck to you! See you on the road...<br /><br />-SB
