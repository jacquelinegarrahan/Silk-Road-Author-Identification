				Okay, so I actually got a little worried a while back before I switched my coin deposit method, then I read something about staying under 3k a month, so I am here to explain my story and ask if it seems like cause for concern -<br /><br />I had been doing bitinstant deposits in a total of about 1600-2000/wk<br />I would create 3 deposit slips in one alias, the rest in another.<br />I never had to use I.D. and I would go to multiple locations for this. <br />Well when I went to do this as usual, I want to one of the centers that knew the name and procedure and etc. but this time it was weird. I walked in and said I needed to do a bill payment, she kind of froze for a sec after she stood up, like she didn&#039;t know what to do (this person had done deposits quite a few times before) and she told me I had to fill out some papers for bill payments, which had never been there before, and went into the back. I stared down at these weird, flashcard sized forms, and as I waited about thirty seconds I assumed this woman had gone into the back to make a phone call, and as there are two phones by where she was I decided it best to leave.<br /><br />To test my theory I drove to the same store, across town, where I had done some once before, and used my second alias, one that took the light deposits. No weird forms. No running in the back. No uncomfortable vibe from the worker.<br /><br />Well, when I went to create more slips a week later, I had a form come up saying there was an Identity problem and I needed to contact zipzap immediately to resolve the issue.<br />The hell?<br /><br />Is it possible with these high volume of deposits I aroused some suspicion to what I was doing? Should I be worried about camera footage and information in an investigation, or am I being paranoid? I believe that I am the only person that does this in my town (SR) though I&#039;m not 100%, and every new zipzap deposit at a new place was always confusing because they had never heard of it before.<br />Some insight? <br />All info was false.

				I could be wrong but Just because you use your Id to buy Bitcoins does not mean the Feds can track your Bitcoin purchases.&nbsp; You are under nop obligation to answer anyboby about what you either traded your Bitcoins for.&nbsp; Bitcoin transactions are not taxable so just don&#039;t tell anyone about your private Bitcoin trading.
