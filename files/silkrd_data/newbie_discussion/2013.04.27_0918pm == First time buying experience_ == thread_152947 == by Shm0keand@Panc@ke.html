				Ive never been ripped off on SR, and i think a big part of that is because i have never FEed either.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My first purchase was some of the best MDMA i have ever had, and it felt awesome

				I have yet to be ripped off but I have to admit that my first purchase had me pretty anxious. I wasn&#039;t worried that I would lose money because I trusted the escrow system but the order took much longer than I or the seller had expected. Overall however I think it was a great transaction, the vendor was very courteous and answered all my newbie questions. It has had had me hooked on SR ever since.

				First two went fine (FE&#039;d early).<br /><br />The second two I&#039;m having issues. Neither I FE&#039;d early and neither I have received.

				I am unsure why we have these two conflicting approaches here:<br />- finalizing early<br />- not finalizing early<br /><br />As far as I understand, the escrow system is meant to keep the buyers safe - so why on earth should a buyer finalize early?<br /><br />Of course I understand that this puts more risk on the vendor side, as they can never sure whether there are scamming customers around. That also seems to be a reason for some sellers to only accept purchases from buyers with more than x successful purchases.

				Bought from a domestic vendor just to be on the safe(r) side and within two days my package arrived. That said, i did have some issues with the packaging which i was reticent about bringing up with the vendor. He sent a piece of hash wrapped in an old piece of toilet paper that looked like it was in his pocket for a week inside a tp tube which was inside a professional looking little mailing box. The addy was scrawled on the box. <br />For me, the key thing is how well the vendor packages. <br />My second purchase was&nbsp; better, company envelope sent from EU. I thought the bulge in the envelope a little conspicuous but it made it to me all the same.<br />Still looking for the vendor that can impress me ...

				i just received my first package yesterday. i made 3 orders from 3 different vendors early friday morning and received the first letter in the mail yesterday (he did say he lived somewhat close to me, so it makes sense that it would be quick, but still, that&#039;s better speed than amazon can offer!) <br /><br />haven&#039;t tried the product yet but it looks like good white mdma-- will be trying it as soon as my other orders come in and i have something to offset the comedown with ;)<br /><br />so far, so good! and actually that order was the one i was most concerned about-- he was a new seller with only 2 feedbacks so i was a little nervous, but the price couldn&#039;t be beat, and in the end it worked out beautifully!<br /><br />still can&#039;t quite believe this place exists&nbsp; ::). only wish these fucking attackers would stop with their BS so I could get on and finalize the order-- I feel bad that I have the product and his money is still tied up in escrow. nothing i can really do about it though right now-- i got on for a second just now, but when i went to click on my orders, it went back down again. sigh.
