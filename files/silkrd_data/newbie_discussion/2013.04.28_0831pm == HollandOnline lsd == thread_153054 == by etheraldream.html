				I recently got some LSD from him (Hoffman blotters) but it was unusually bitter (very strongly so)<br /><br />Last few times when I tried hoffman lsd it was not bitter at all (from Jesusofrave)<br /><br />I bought a test kit and will update this topic whether it was lsd or not after all<br /><br />his review thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95571.msg1046043#msg1046043<br /><br />HollandOnline SR<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b27491ec56

				Good day !<br /><br />yes this is strange...Jezusofrave is selling exactly the same print as you must have noticed....<br /><br />by the way.. the correct spelling of the Great Creator is Dr. Albert Hofmann......<br /><br /><br />We hope to have informed you well...<br /><br /><br />Sincerely Yours,<br />HollandOnline

				Well, I didn&#039;t expect you yo to answer here, I&#039;ll update this thread as I said<br /><br />The trip was good and interesting, came-up was not too slow and the trip lasted the right amount of time<br /><br />but a lot of people say that if it&#039;s a bitter it&#039;s a spitter ... but I am not so critical... <br /><br />I&#039;ll test it with elrich eztest ehrlich on Tuesday or Wednesday<br /><br />

				I ordered the hoffmans and tried on friday. Overall i found them very good. Didnt take long to peak and very visual as opposed to a head trip if you get me. I ordered ten and was sent 26. Not sure if mistake or just my lucky day. Thanks guys i will be back :)

				Just cause its the same print doesnt mean its from the same person. I had some Hofmanss from JOR and they we&#039;re really shitty tasting but they were definitely acid.

				acid is taste and odorless, a slight bitterness comes form the ink, the blotters are printed with. very strong bitter blotters are usually DOx or 25x-NBOMe chemicals. i&#039;d stay away from bitter &quot;LSD&quot;.

				FROm my expereince, i find im a coinesseur of sorts when it comes to taste and smell. and i can tell you , i have been dealt a bad hand of the nbom, and the CLEAR and SHEER difference between the 2 is the difference between acidic burning from the acid, and the bitter numbing from the n bom, 5 minutes with an nbom in ur mouth and you should be good for a root canal....jk... but this is how i distinguish between the 2. i have done so much acid, i know and shiver/quiver at the taste of it, like almost licking a 9 volt battery... i get tongue burn under my tongue from acid when i take an excess of 4 or 5 hits. glad to help
