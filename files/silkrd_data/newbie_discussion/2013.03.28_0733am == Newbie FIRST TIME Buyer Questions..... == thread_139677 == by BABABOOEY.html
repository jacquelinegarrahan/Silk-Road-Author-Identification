				Hey folks! Im super new &amp; have pretty much gotten some great tips &amp; info so far but was still a bit confused on how to go about getting my FIRST purchase under my belt with no hassles. I was told to try Bitfloor as my bitcoin exchange. Is there any1 that can tell me Step by Step how and what exactly I need 2 do from depositing my cash up to the actual delivery of my product? Also, in USD the price for the product i wana order lets say is $100....Would I need to only pay $100 to the bitcoin folks or would it depend on the market price how much i&#039;d pay??? So confused LOL....Thanks 4 any advice...Just wanna make this as SAFE &amp; SECURE a transaction as possible!

				I personally used Bitinstant ==&gt; Bitstamp and deposited cash at CVS through Moneygram, then transferred the bitcoins to my wallet.<br /><br />Load up whatever you plan on buying + shipping in your shopping cart, then transfer exact funds over from your wallet. It takes about an hour or so to transfer from your wallet to SR. Then wallah, you&#039;re done.<br /><br />Just make sure you deposit enough money with the fees, it adds up to maybe $5 more total.

				Take the amount you want to have on SR and add $15. Submit this as your deposit request on Bitfloor. Go to BoA and ask for an out-of-state deposit slip (assuming you don&#039;t live in NY). Fill in all the information Bitfloor provided you and deposit the exact amount they tell you. Your money will most likely be in your account by the time you get home. Trade the money in your account for BTC. Send those BTC to your SR account. Done. <br /><br />

				I have heard of people being asked for ID when using the Moneygram method. No ID is required at BoA. As far as a SSN, you shouldn&#039;t be giving that out for any reason.

				The public keys are for PGP encryption. You will need to learn it. It&#039;s not hard. You will use it to encrypt your address when you place an order.<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />And yes, PMs are safe. It&#039;s a good idea to encrypt your messages as well, unless the vendor states that it&#039;s not necessary. Like I said, it&#039;s not hard and it&#039;s better to be safe thatn sorry.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				One last thing....I wanted to get my first order out tomorrow. Is it absolutely necessary to have PGP down BEFORE placing my order with the vendor for a small amount the first time around?? Just double checking...Thanks again

				Not all vendors require PGP but it is highly recommended for your own protection. I would learn it first before rushing to make your first order.
