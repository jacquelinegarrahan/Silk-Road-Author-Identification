				Hi.<br /><br />So, got my first order from the road that I&#039;m unhappy with (MDMA) from a 99 rated seller advertising moonrocks. Comments from previous feedbacks say it was sassy smelling brown shards... I received pure white fluffy powder. Looks exactly like my mephedrone used to look like. <br /><br />Has this happened to any of you, fellow &quot;newbies&quot;? I&#039;m awaiting response from the vendor, and although I asked about big rocks and he said there wasn&#039;t any left and that it&#039;s lightly smelling of sass and small crystals it&#039;s literally pure white powder. <br /><br />Powder is usually always cut.<br /><br />Or Drone. <br /><br />Damnnit.

				Who did you order from? I too am trying to get to fifty posts, but , I am also a new vendor here. I have many listings up. Although I haven&#039;t had any MDMA orders yet, earlier today I was going to send a sample of MDMA out to someone, and I crushed the molly up before vacuum sealing so I could ship it discreetly. <br /><br />If you look at the pictures on my account, you&#039;ll see the huge moon rocks. Light brown yellow...but upon crushing it turned an off white almost. Still very shardy/crystally though<br /><br />I have no idea, maybe you got ripped<br /><br />I know what I have is certainly genuine MDMA. Can&#039;t wait till some people receive and start giving feedback

				I saw yours, looks like almost reddish rocks. I won&#039;t name out the seller until I figure out what&#039;s going on, I can tell the difference between left overs from shards and being pulverized to fluff. Does not taste proper either. I am no newb to MDMA (or phens or tryps of any kind) and know my shit. I can&#039;t afford to roll right now though and my friend has the kit bottles (marquis and mecke). <br /><br />I have never in my time here seen white powder be legit. Up in the great white north we normally get brown/tan crystals or it&#039;s bunk. Off the road there has been some awesome purple stuff which crushes down to pretty much pure white but it has a distinct smell and there&#039;s no doubts it was from shards even looking at it crushed up. <br /><br />It&#039;s also not fluffy. Fluffy is always drone in my experience. I&#039;d rather methylone over drone.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep bitching till I hit 50 or get a reply from the vendor.

				Honestly because of the way the road works, even if it is bunk, I&#039;m gonna end up having to leave my 5/5 and not ask for a refund or I&#039;ll hurt my stats. <br /><br />Lesson learned, use a different vendor. It was my first MDMA order and I only wanted a gram. Looks like I&#039;ll have to buy at least a half oz to get the quality I want though.<br /><br />T-Hip, your stuff looks realllllly red in your pics, is it actually just brown?<br /><br />Being new to the road I want to avoid new vendors, for both my sake and theirs. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to hurt anyone&#039;s ratings, but right off the bat the vendor should change the posting from moonrocks to finely crushed fluffy white powder unless the situation changes IMO. Again, this isn&#039;t just some rocks crushed down to fit in a baggy for transport, this is baking powder in consistency and look.<br /><br />Tastes almost salty from the tiny bit I&#039;m willing to taste.<br /><br />I wager still it&#039;s mephedrone. <br /><br />

				Another shady thing is that a previous buyer from the same ad left feedback that he had wonderful brown shards that smelt like sass. Less than 2 weeks before my order. Again, same posting.<br /><br />I wish it was dirty and brown at this point, I trust that more than this!<br /><br />The test kit will tell all. Just sucks I might have to wait a week to get it done.<br /><br />If it ends up being drone should I change the rating? I feel like I&#039;m hurting myself by getting ripped off because I&#039;m still under 5 transactions.

				T-Hip, if it wasn&#039;t for my being a newb to the myself (less than a month) and being paranoid of new vendors I would definitely give you a shot next.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be crazy if I have to order a half just to get decent product, at that point I could look like a reseller which I will never be. <br /><br />Why must it be so hard to find good MDMA. So many times I get excited only to see Marquis turn yellow or no change at all. <br /><br />

				More rocks normally means better quality but you can&#039;t judge a book by its cover.<br />Off the road I got two types of m a nicelookin half oz, nice clear rocks some as big as 3 grams and the. Other<br />Half o was a tan powder with a weird texture. I assumed the better looking crystals would be far more popular after they were both testes the brown was a stronger product.<br />My point is until you trip test it or use a kit it&#039;s hard to say if you got the bomb or the fucking schmag

				That&#039;s it... Still a chance this could be amazing bomb 100% cleaned up with no smell left... honestly it wouldn&#039;t be going for this cheap if that were the case though. <br /><br />I&#039;m mostly going on and on right now to post to 50 but don&#039;t want to just spam useless crap. I&#039;d rather have a lovely discussion about some of our common interests here.<br /><br />Seriously, has anyone ever got PURE WHITE fluffy mdma powder with no smell that isn&#039;t cut? <br /><br />I will test .125 Friday night. I still have some of my bomb purple moon rock that I got locally but I was hoping to find a new supplier before I run out it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t care if there&#039;s only one rock and the rest is powder, or tiny tiny shards, but when you are told Moonrocks and you get only powder that&#039;s kind of misleading. <br /><br />Won&#039;t buy MD from a Coke dealer anymore. Always disappoints, real life and now the road too.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve ordered MDMA from long-established trusted vendors and a few new ones. I got bad quality product once (from a vendor who was around for about a month). He had 99% positive feedback and was in the top 3% of vendors with lots of 5/5 reviews. But the thing is, in the first month a vendor can get an artificially inflated reputation like that by giving out many samples and from all the FE and people who give 5/5 as soon as the product arrived and haven&#039;t tested it yet.<br /><br />When I checked back a few weeks later his reputation had gone right down and many reviews told of his products being cut, poor quality or not even the product that was ordered. That kind of thing will happen occasionally. You just have to live with occasional losses.<br /><br />The new 50 post policy also means there are far fewer people able to post reviews of products in the Rumour Mill and not many people come back to edit their feedback on SR after they&#039;ve tried the product, so most reviews are people saying that the package arrived or was stealthy.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not rocks it doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t be good, but often you get what you pay for. The best I&#039;ve had has always been when I ordered MDMA that I considered too expensive and the stuff that was bad was very cheap.

				Iv had white cloudy powder mdma that was really pure, but I wouldn&#039;t consider it fluffy puresay. There were some decent size crystals that had smaller ones sticking to it though almost giving it a fluffy texture when light was shone on it

				Yeah, out of all my orders on the road this was the only one I was worried about for the above mentioned reasons. I got it at the same price that one of my close friends passes to me and me only when he gets good stuff, I shouldn&#039;t of expected the same on the road.<br /><br />The shadiest part that bothers me is that comments say they received brown shards and I got something completely different.<br /><br />Honestly the best looking domestic stuff to me is all in bulk and I don&#039;t have the cash nor the balls to order it... even though I&#039;m sure domestically 14g of MDMA isn&#039;t a big deal, but that&#039;s way more than my consumption for a year and I absolutely do not resell, I&#039;m a strict end user.<br /><br />T-Hip, if you&#039;re watching, you&#039;re gonna be my next order if you&#039;re still around and have some feedback.<br /><br />If you are willing to give samples to a domestic and trust me I&#039;ll give a straight up honest review and feedback.<br /><br />PS. There is no feedback for this vendor&#039;s MDMA on the forums, only SR feedback. Lots for his cocaine and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s how he has such an excellent rating.<br /><br />Even if it&#039;s drone it&#039;ll have it&#039;s time. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d be more upset with, pure mephedrone or heavily cut mdma. <br /><br />.125 this Friday will tell all. Although .125 of pure mephedrone could easily get mistaken with cut MDMA as I find the effects at that level to be rather mild. <br /><br />Rant rant rant. Better than spamming nonsense though IMO.<br /><br />Someone resell some damn proper MD in small amounts up here. T-Hip I hope your business takes off well!

				Dude, I feel your pain. The very first time I bought MDMA (not on silk road, from a dealer) it was a very odd looking dry off-white paste. I didn&#039;t test it (literally a schoolboy error) and it didn&#039;t really give me any effects beyond a sore stomach and crusty nostrils&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />That said though, another time upon receiving the goods, found I&#039;d been sold tiny yellowed shards of relatively low grade MDMA (only 0.83g when I paid for a gram, scoundrels! :P). Didn&#039;t fancy bombing it even though there were no active cuts, so I grabbed a rolling pin and crushed the crystals up. Strangely enough, the result was a pure white powder with no smell.<br /><br />It&#039;s entirely possible that your vendor&#039;s sold you alright MDMA. Possibly the crystals weren&#039;t of the best appearance, so they&#039;ve crushed them up to make it look somewhat more feasible.<br /><br />Hope Friday goes well for you, I&#039;ve got some of Pyramid&#039;s MDMA on the way for some point after 4/20. His listing&#039;s picture looks exactly like the product, great looking white crystals (Yet, they also don&#039;t smell ??? ).

				i dont want to excuse anyone, but first thing is always to talk about it with your vendor.<br />it could also just have been a failure by them.<br /><br />i also recieved to less or a different prodcut already from very good vendors i trust.<br />no reason to instantly freak out. test it and then talk back to your vendor.<br /><br />if he isnt replieng, well then i guess u have your answer. change the vendor :)<br /><br />the difference between mdma and mephedrone is way to big to be unsure after a test<br />mmc will get u rushing heavy very fast and the idea of craving is so strong, you will see yourself redosing about every 1-2 hours, to keep the effect. as it wears off you can feel it very heavy. its not that peacfull as when mdma wears off.

				oh yeah man, I&#039;m well versed with drone. It also makes me gurn for a whole day afterwards too (probably because once I start with it I can&#039;t stop until the sun rises) <br /><br />I&#039;ll know right away if I take just .125 or .150 and its a light roll feeling with a huge urge to redose, let alone the lack of empathy and love.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need a test kit to tell the difference between MD like substances at this point in my life, and as much as you can&#039;t tell a book by it&#039;s cover I&#039;ve seen my fair share of meph and this stuff is giving me flashbacks! <br /><br />I have sent messages to the vendor, and he was straight up after I ordered when I asked about ensuring there be some rocks that there were no real large ones. I just didn&#039;t expect NONE (perhaps just a few small shards even)<br /><br />Starting to regret having my 50 posts be a giant whine session without even trying the product hahaha.<br /><br />What just gave me a bit of hope is realizing that CanadianForger&#039;s Ivory MDMA has powder in it that looks similar to this. So perhaps I really did get some bomb super clean stuff. My taste test came up weak though.<br /><br />Thanks everyone for the input. Since it&#039;s a small amount and it was subsidized by bitcoin deflation I&#039;m not too annoyed. I&#039;m sure the product is still active at least and fun times will be had by someone at some point in time!<br /><br />Perhaps I should upload a photo for fun (ex. data removed of course).

				Hahhaha yeah, I&#039;ve had a very long love affair with MDMA. 2 years straight I had nothing but afterglows... at first for a whole week, then just a day or two after. Now I get a glow the next day but I&#039;m definitely going to feel some backend on day 3 or 4. Roll on a Friday, my Tuesday and Wednesday will be filled with fighting off negative thoughts all day.<br /><br />&nbsp;If I roll every week without a break they get intense to the point where I&#039;ll sleep my whole tuesday afternoon after work away! Always feel better by the following Friday. Completely back to normal by the end of the next weekend.<br /><br />Meph never gave me those Tuesday/Wednesdays but the stuff just feels way too wrong in ways I can&#039;t describe. The moreish portion of it is not desirable, I usually end up redosing my MDMA when I shouldn&#039;t... Throw Meph in there and it becomes a messy (yet wonderful) night. Yes, I hate meph but I wouldn&#039;t be saying that if I was on it!<br /><br />I also use Piracetam pretty much every single roll otherwise it&#039;s never good enough it seems and the day after is always worse without it.<br /><br />Well, at least by the time I hit 50 posts people can look and see what my use is like. I&#039;ll go into a bit more detail for fun!<br /><br />I&#039;m awaiting on a good amount of 2C-B, I intend to use it to buffer my MDMA usage as to avoid comedown Tuesdays. I&#039;ve had it many times in pills before but this will be my first time getting access to powder. I&#039;m really looking forward to it. (I almost thought the MDMA I received was the 2C-B, that&#039;s how white and processed it looks. I had to weigh and verify tracking numbers to make sure! haha)<br /><br />I&#039;m also pumped for bicycle day this week but that would mean I can&#039;t test this MD out on myself unless I want to flip with a possibly unknown substance. I&#039;m gonna wait for the marquis results probably. I have 2 WoWs left and some gandalfs, tee hee!<br /><br />Otherwise I enjoy my herbs day in and day out, but those I don&#039;t procure on the road; prices and risk are way too high!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read TIHKAL and PIHKAL front to back and have had the pleasure of trying quite a few 2Cs.<br /><br />I also enjoy a trip to hyperspace once and awhile.
