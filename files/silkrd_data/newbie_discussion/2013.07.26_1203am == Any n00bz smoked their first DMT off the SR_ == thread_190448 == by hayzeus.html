				I smoked one hit of DMT when I was a lot younger and just felt disgusting.&nbsp; Got really anxious and felt like my heart was beating out of my chest, but no hallucinogenic properties.&nbsp; I&#039;m ready to give it a go one more time. So....<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about making my next purchase a bag of DMT.&nbsp; Any first timers out there source their first bag off the SR?

				The DMT on the road is good. But just like most people new to DMT, I wasted a lot of mine. I recommend buying a glass vape pipe (meth pipe). If you&#039;re gonna do it, do it right.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never even seen DMT outside of SR. I wouldn&#039;t trust someone selling DMT around my area, sounds like a good way to die because someone sold you whatever RC they found cheapest online.

				The spirit molecule is the reason I came to Silk Road in the first place. I would HIGHLY suggest you give it another try OP. Make sure you get it from a legit dealer though. Roger Pete always seems to have good reviews. It will change your perception of the world.
