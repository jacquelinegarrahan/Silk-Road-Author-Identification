				Hey there! Mrfingers here, been a member of SR for 2 years. Don&#039;t post much on the forums but there&#039;s a pretty commonly asked question here on SR. <br /><br />How the fuck do I get bitcoins without getting scammed? <br /><br />Only use a bitcoin vendor that&#039;s reputable.<br /><br />How do I determine who&#039;s reputable?<br /><br />Check the forums, look for multiple positive reviews from members (like this one here!), the more reviews and the more experience the members have, the better. Also check around for scam reviews, though if you see one or two, don&#039;t jump the gun too quickly! Often paranoid members freak out and assume the worst way too quickly. Use discretion.<br /><br />Also! Check the vendor&#039;s account history, how&#039;s his feedback? How&#039;s his reviews? How many transactions has he done? Typically a trustworthy and reputable BTC vendor will have a roughly 4.8-5.0 rating with at least 300 transactions.&nbsp; Any less than this, and you&#039;re taking a risk.<br /><br />Gosh! Mrfingers! Most of the BTC vendors on the site don&#039;t match the description of a reputable BTC vendor as you have described them, what the fuck will I do now?!<br /><br />Well you can go ahead and take a risk and give em your money, but chances are they are scammers and you will be S.O.L.<br /><br />But there&#039;s another option, remember that guy I mentioned in the title? What was his name? Oh yeah!<br /><br />JumboMonkeyBiscuit. You must have passed him somehow while searching for BTC vendors, not a problem! Here&#039;s a link to his vendor page here: <br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/75803901ae<br /><br />this guy has had my coins within 24 hours of him receiving the cash every single time. And I&#039;ve gone through him a lot of times. I won&#039;t say how much money, but I will say you can trust him with amounts that level out to thousands of MURICAN dollars.
