				Found 1 Feb 2013:&nbsp; clearnet link:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-silk-road-is-showing-cracks<br /><br />&quot;It always sounded like a hoax, didn&#039;t it? Silk Road: an Internet website where you can buy any drug in the world? Yeah, right. But it&#039;s real. It was almost two years ago that we first heard about the site, which hosts everything from Adderall to Ketamine, LSD to MDMA and tons and tons of weed. After it started to pick up a ton of press and exposure, we all thought that certainly the Silk Road would get shut down. It&#039;s super illegal to sell drugs or even to help people sell drugs. But it didn&#039;t. Silk Road survives to this day. However, with the arrival this week of the first conviction of a Silk Road-related crime, you have to wonder if Silk Road&#039;s days might be numbered after all.&quot;<br /><br />So, are we doomed?&nbsp; Is it good that the masses think that Silk Road is 50% police and 50% sellers about to be busted?

				Did you read the whole article?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Despite the many layers of anonymity and firewalls involved in the Silk Road experience — encrypted transfers of the anonymous currency Bitcoin, for instance — Howard got caught last summer from the simplest mistake. He had a shitload of drugs sent to his house. Though it&#039;s unclear what tipped them off — drug dogs? snitches? some sophisticated cyber crime task force? — police intercepted a number of packages bound for Howard&#039;s home, opened them up, and ended up finding a total of 46.9 grams of pure MDMA and 14.5 grams of cocaine. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />PGP - USE IT.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see where either the Farmer&#039;s Market or this guy were using it.&nbsp; This dude may have been, but something else could have tripped him up.&nbsp; International order maybe?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Don&#039;t freak out yet.

				It doesn&#039;t say if this guy ordered from an International source, but in my opinion that magnifies the risk ten-fold. <br /><br />46.9g of MDMA sent through customs, is a sizeable amount to conceal, no matter how good the stealth packaging is. <br /><br />It also doesn&#039;t say if this chap used PGP.<br /><br />In my view, lazy people who don&#039;t take advantage of the precautions available, are asking for trouble. Especially if you get large amounts sent to your own house.<br /><br />Personally, I only order small amounts from domestic sellers, I filter my bitcoins, and I always encrypt my delivery addresses. Probably the safest way imo.

				I have a hard time getting worried reading this when someone is dealing in RL as well. On the street you know 95% of the people who get busted lower in the chain do anything to save their asses. You also never know if he was just plain stupid and told some of those &quot;trusted&quot; few busted folk by which way he was receiving product. We also don&#039;t know if packages did not arrive prior to the ones they intercepted and he was being sloppy using the same drop.

				46 grams is not that much mdma...its not even 2 zips....if it was vacuum sealed it would have been about as thick as a magazine.<br /><br />that wasnt his issue.<br /><br />he got ratted out<br />has a big mouth<br />or ordered 10 packages to his house in the same week under a different name and it looked really weird

				The cops are grandstanding because of a bust that has little to do with them cracking anything about SR. At least that&#039;s how it looks from here. I guess it buys some politician some thumbs up and good will from constituents who don&#039;t look closely.
