				Alright chaps!!<br />I&#039;ve ordered 7g Cheese from Mr. bud UK. I noticed that he didn&#039;t have any previous transactions but I thought I&#039;d order because everyone has to start somewhere, right?<br />Since I placed my order he hasn&#039;t been seen (for 3 days) and no longer has any active listings.<br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s fine and he&#039;s just been busy for a few days but am starting to worry a little.<br />What do you guys think?

				They don&#039;t even seem to have a vendor account at all anymore(only the option to send a message) unless I&#039;m looking at the wrong account. Did you finalise?

				Yeah everything&#039;s been fine. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, there won&#039;t be a full scale police investigation for some lads buying a bit of weed.<br />I was paranoid at first too but once i&#039;d cancelled i felt better cos even if they do have my address i&#039;ve not done anything wrong! I placed an order and then though against it.<br />Drugs are bad mkay!&nbsp; ;D

				Yeah mate, shouldn&#039;t be this much hassle for ya! Budworx seem like a good vendor as does Mr. Cronk I&#039;d give one of them a try next time! Hope you get things resolved pal!<br /><br />Halfway Crooks are second to none, comms are outstanding and he really beats his self up if you don&#039;t get it next day delivery. Only trouble is he&#039;s very pricey!
