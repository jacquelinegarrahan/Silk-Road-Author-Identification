				Vendor profile is here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0c4e5b2a71/<br /><br />I want some lucky strikes.&nbsp; He/she sells them way cheap.&nbsp; But, one review from a couple weeks ago is a huge long block text about them being a scammer and many of their reviews seem copy-pasted/fake.<br /><br />For the icing on the cake: the ****bird requires FE. <br /><br />I&#039;m not an idiot. I don&#039;t need the next 5 responses to be, &quot;Oh, yeah, NEVER FE&quot;.&nbsp; I won&#039;t purchase from this vendor unless I don&#039;t have to FE.&nbsp; I messaged them telling them so, so we&#039;ll see. But the other guy selling luckies (I think the vendor is &quot;joy&quot;), while also selling them for cheap, has shipping rates of about 0.3 bitcoins PER CARTON.&nbsp; So while it&#039;s a $35 for 200 luckies (which in my state would be hella cheap for any brand) it&#039;s another 35 for shipping PER CARTON.&nbsp; Which is just ... exorbitant.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />T017

				If he still is going to make you FE, then you have to just weight the risk/reward. I know in my state prices for cigs are sometimes half of what they are in other states, so I am not sure about your state, but if the prices are like one third of what they are face value at the local store, I would say go for it.<br /><br />And if you get fucked, you can always tell him to go fuck himself and ruin his perfect feedback (100) - atleast last time i checked.<br /><br />I would go with Only if the price difference compared to your state is worth it.

I like my cowboy boots.&nbsp; 8)

				I have purchased from the user &quot;only&quot; and received my carton (Marlboro Red * 10) successfully without any issues. Personally, I would not be worried of not receiving a product I order from &quot;only&quot; since the user has built quite a big reputation on the Internet (not only Silk Road) and because of the successful order I had. The user has a website (http://www.cigs.eu/) on the clear web as well. If you do not trust something, you better be safe than sorry. Keep in mind, though, that everyone on here cannot (easily) be traced back as a person in life. So it will always have its risks, especially when finalizing early.

I am sure the user posted on several places (including this forum) that (s)he owns the website. If it is true (s)he is denying any association with the ownership of the website, it says enough to raise suspicion since the user&#039;s thread in the Rumor mill section tells something else. In [1] (see below) you can see from the thread title that at the time that the second post was made it contained the website.<br /><br />[1] http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18734.msg188182#msg188182 (Re: Only (Cigs.eu) Official Thread - Reviews and Updates)<br /><br />I would suggest contacting the user [2] again and trying to resolve the issue. By all means, if that does not result to you receiving your product or any reasons for you not to have received it, go ahead and bring it to the public.<br /><br />[2] http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=16743, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/0c4e5b2a71
