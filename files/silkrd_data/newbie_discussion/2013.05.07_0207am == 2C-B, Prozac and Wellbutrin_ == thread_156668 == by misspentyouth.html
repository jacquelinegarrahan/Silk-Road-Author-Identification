				Folks,<br /><br />I&#039;ve done a lot of research on MDMA and 2C-B.&nbsp; <br /><br />My love has taken generic Wellbutrin and Prozac for years.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t expect much from E but gave it a try anyway.&nbsp; There&#039;s LOTS of information on E/MDMA and Wellbutrin and Prozac.<br /><br />We tried Kwikemart&#039;s E ... a first ever (and we&#039;re middle aged).&nbsp; First time 1 pill, I felt some, she felt nothing but a bit speedy.&nbsp; Next time 2 pills each ... at about 2 hours she said, &quot;this is pretty worthless&quot;.&nbsp; So we vaped some nice weed ... and she looked at me, her eyes huge and said, &quot;I FEEL FUCKING AWESOME.&nbsp; TOUCH ME!&quot;<br /><br />What followed was the most amazing 5 hours of sex and touching.&nbsp; I&#039;d touch her, hold her in close, ... well, you get the picture.&nbsp; Constant orgasms from her.<br /><br />So we are now considering 2C-B.&nbsp; But there&#039;s much less info in general and almost nothing on its use with the two pharmas mentioned.<br /><br />Any research you can point us to?<br />

				can&#039;t give you any links or more info atm as i&#039;m kinda totalled but i&#039;ve taken 2c-e/d/p together with wellbutrin (and could be that I was also on cymbalta (SNRI) at the same time but can&#039;t remember really)<br /><br />and I had no problems at all; I was also on abilify (antipsychotic) but i stopped taking it couple weeks in advance cuz that would prevent most of the fun stuff from the 2C-B<br /><br />on bluelight.ru there&#039;s most likely some info about this subject

				Not JUST worried about effects (that too) but first and foremost, SAFETY.

				I&#039;ve heard a lot of things about SSRIs (ex. Prozac) and MDMA. Supposedly it prevents the roll. It&#039;s probably fairly dodgy to take any two drugs which both act on your serotonin without doing a lot of research prior. Helps that SR reviews make it fairly easy to determine the purity of the drugs around here, thus removing some of the guesswork from the equation by reducing the number of variables.
