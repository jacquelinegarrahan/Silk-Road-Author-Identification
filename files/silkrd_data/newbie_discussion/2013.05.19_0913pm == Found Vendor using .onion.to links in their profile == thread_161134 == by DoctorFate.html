				This is horrible and negligent but it really highlights the fact that we need to make this whole thing easier to use, so anyone can get access to a secure computing environment and use it safely.<br /><br />Maybe someone should make a video tutorial course and upload it to YouTube or something, the general population struggle reading stuff and the more people join Silk Road the more the people here are more like the rest of the Internet.

				A site that ends in .onion is actually on the Tor network and is secure. Nobody knows what website you&#039;re visiting, even if they&#039;re recording all your traffic they have no idea what you&#039;re up to.<br /><br />&quot;onion.to&quot; is a website on the public Internet which acts as a bridge between the Tor network and the Internet, it just forwards your requests to the Tor network. A site that ends in onion.to belongs to this website.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know who &quot;Xxor AB&quot; are, but I do know that they can see all of your traffic. They might be working with law enforcement, they might not. When visiting onion.to sites you&#039;re also making DNS requests for the domain names (like silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to), these can be read by anyone between you and onion.to&#039;s DNS server. Unless you&#039;re connected to https://somesite.onion.to/ rather than http://somesite.onion.to/ then everything you do can be seen by everyone between you and onion.to. This could be your ISP, the feds, anyone who has access and is listening/recording.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using onion.to then you&#039;re riding Tor bareback. Don&#039;t do that, it&#039;s just not worth it.

				Yes it&#039;s for accessing hidden services when you don&#039;t have need for security and presumably you&#039;re on a system that doesn&#039;t have TOR installed.&nbsp; If you&#039;re accessing the proxy service using TOR then they shouldn&#039;t have any of your information and the data that they&#039;re forwarding for you should all be encrypted (my understanding anyway).&nbsp; I suppose it could be used to confirm your identity if they&#039;re already watching your data requests via your ISP and see the correlated data requests but that seems pretty far fetched since they would have to already suspect you and get the co-operation of this xxor proxy service.<br /><br /><br />Visit onion.to and it says created by Xxor AB in the top right corner.&nbsp; Click on that and it takes you to their company website xxor.se which says they are a Swedish (Stockholm) based IT company.<br /><br />

That includes passphrase and PIN data through the use of a keylogger. If they are doing that then anybody who has used it - whether they use it through Tor or not - has potentially had their account compromised, both vendor and buyer alike.<br /><br />Libertas
