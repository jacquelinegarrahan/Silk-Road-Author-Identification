				I wanted to post this in the La Fuente review thread but it seems I may only post in this forum for now. Does anyone here know which shipping option he uses for the 1/4lb orders? It just says &quot;Included&quot; on the shipping options.<br /><br />Sorry if this is the wrong place but I need to know.
