				10g&#039;s is not that much, I don&#039;t think you should have to worry about anyone busting down your door to be honest. Really, the only thing that could be problematic is that the name you used and address could be shot, and all other pending mail could be screened from this point on.

				That&#039;s what&#039;s commonly referred to as a &quot;love letter.&quot;&nbsp; Lots of info if you google customs love letter, but I believe the general consensus is not to do anything. Ignore the letter, don&#039;t respond and cut your losses with the shipment. <br /><br />Also way back before I knew about SR I used to order from some of the international pharmacies, etc, but that was pharms, generally not totally illicit stuff like that.&nbsp; But I never got a LL in hundreds of orders.&nbsp; Once in a while you see one on a forum but its pretty much luck of the draw. <br /><br />&nbsp; Personally now that im on SR I always just check the &quot;domestic vendors only&quot; box.&nbsp; Even if it costs a few bucks more or whatever, I think international shipping is just another added risk.&nbsp; A small one, perhaps, but think about it: every incoming package is going to have to go through customs. I just don&#039;t like that. There&#039;s plenty of us sellers.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Clean house at the address, deny everything(as you stated), cut your losses, and learn from the experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s a risk we run on this particular road of life.&nbsp; :(

				Customs started cracking down on MDMA trafficking awhile ago, and I&#039;ve noticed a lot of the seized packages are E. Seems like it&#039;s definitely a bad idea to ship any of the major drugs overseas, but it seems to me that stuff that is either more rare (research chems that have recently been scheduled, dmt, lsd) are probably fine overseas. Anyone had any trouble with packages containing that sort of thing getting flagged?

				DO NOT respond to them, even to deny it.&nbsp; Ignore the letter, destroy any evidence, and definitely don&#039;t order anything illegal through customs for a while.&nbsp; If you&#039;re ever confronted, plead ignorance.&nbsp; You should have plausible deniability unless they can prove that you were the one to request the MDMA.&nbsp; Most the time nothing will happen after a love letter, but 10g of MDMA would be a somewhat serious charge since MDMA penalties are very harsh in the US.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Just do absolutely nothing. Pretend as if you didn&#039;t even order MDMA, or any mail for that matter. Live as if it was just another, and eventually, all will be settled.
