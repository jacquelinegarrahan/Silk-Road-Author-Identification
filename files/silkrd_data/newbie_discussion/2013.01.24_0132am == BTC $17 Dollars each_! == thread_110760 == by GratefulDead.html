				WHAT is up with this!! i was buying them for $13 each and was fine with it, but this is crazy, i don&#039;t want to buy them at this price, i want them to go back down but does anyone see that happening? do the prices fluctuate frequently? i use bit instant and mt gox!

				If you just spend them right after you buy them it won&#039;t be much of an issue. Most of the prices on SR are pegged to the US Dollar, not the Bitcoin.

				I noticed this price change the other day.<br /><br />I had 4 BTC purchased at $13, so they were no worth $17 which made me slightly happy. I also kept in mind that most SR vendors pricing automatically gets adjusted. It&#039;s pretty crazy, however, it makes one think that perhaps you should always be turning fiat in to BTC? I suppose you can get screwed, but why not?

				try $20.00. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m grasping why this is bad. The value of currency should go up. Plus, correct me if I&#039;m wrong- aren&#039;t BTC purposefully delineated into have many dec. points?&nbsp; This would suggest that as we move towards 120,000,000 BTC in circulation, that the currency will continue to gain value, and footing.&nbsp; <br /><br />My personal concern (and, admittedly a moment of panic) was if SR vendors didn&#039;t adjust their pricing accordingly to the BTC rate. I see that they do. Go SR.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				FWIW , My theory on why bitcoin has been rising is that its due to a&nbsp; few recent articles on websites like arstechnica about bitcoin gambling. I think one article claimed that satoshidice was making nearly a million dollars a year. With the US govt thugs cracking down on online gambling sites that do business with Americans (even in other countries) , bitcoin has a huge potential to become the currency of internet gambling. If that happens the shits really going to hit the fan and they are going to try very hard to make bitcoin trading illegal.

				Last price:$20.79000 - this morning 2/1/2013 <br /><br />It is true it doesn&#039;t matter what they cost unless as nkcell and dantana posted. So just purchase what you are going to spend right then - I don&#039;t move the coins till I know what I want and then I send ONLY that amount to SR. <br /><br />If you purchased them for $20 and they dropped an hour later to $5, yeh - you&#039;d be fucked, but that just helps me be super careful and keep up on wtf is goin on with the damn things.<br /><br />Last; if the vendor chooses NOT to peg prices to dollars but bitcoins then their price doesn&#039;t change. Not too many of them do that so they can stay in business. Remember buyers - we control the marked IRL and in here by our spending practices! Don&#039;t be a junkie! If some vendor wants too much for something - no matter what the bitcoin is doing - just go surfing instead! Shrug? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I made about $160 in bitcoin in less than a week because of the price rising after I bought a small bulk of coins. I want to invest a little but I&#039;m worried it will drop again. I guess there&#039;s not a ton of risk in investing though since the prices are pinned to btc and not usd?

				Is there really any risk of investing if the pricing is pinned to the value of the btc? If btc tanks and the values of listings are relevant to the cost of btc, it shouldn&#039;t matter right? I guess there&#039;s always a chance that vendors could raise their prices.

				Yeah, as long as you spend them pretty quickly after you buy them it won&#039;t affect you if they are 10$ or 30$.&nbsp; Most items are pegged to a currency (such as USD) and will automatically go up or down with the BTC value.<br /><br />-AA

				I&#039;ve read some of the people who invest huge in this currency and personally I can&#039;t do it. Maybe some short sales to make a buck or two but long term it&#039;s risky as hell. Brass balls, blind faith, and luck might prove me wrong but it&#039;s too scary of a ride for me.

				As long as you had a way to offload them in a hurry, it doesn&#039;t seem TOO risky.&nbsp; But you would have to be able to sell them the second you see it dropping fast.<br /><br />

				Looks like there was a big sell off this morning. mtgoxUSD Prices went from an overnight high of $21 to hit as low as $18.25 before recovering a bit to $19.5. I&#039;d be wary of holding any BTC today...<br /><br />http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg1ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv

				Haha oh God this thread makes me wish I had bought 100BTC when I had the chance.<br /><br />Invested $350 when the BTC was at 110. Hopefully it will continue to rise. I don&#039;t expect much return but I would like to make a little profit, even just to spend on drugs.
