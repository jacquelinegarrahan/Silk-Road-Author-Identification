				So i realized ive been using a link to access the road that ends with &quot;.onion.to&quot; apparently the &quot;.to&quot; is so you can access the hidden web for users who dont have tor ......is it still secure if i placed orders from silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to if i was using that link in tor, like i have the tor browser installed routing me to another ip adress, but is that still secure if i have to go through the onion.to link?

				Security is not absolute, so there&#039;s never such a thing as &quot;secure&quot; and &quot;not secure&quot;.<br /><br />But I&#039;m sorry to say that accessing SR over onion.to is A LOT LESS SECURE than accessing it over tor.<br /><br />When accessing over onion.to, the operators of every network over which your communication is carried (from your computer to the onion.to server) can see exactly what you&#039;re doing and from exactly what IP address you are connecting (the communication isn&#039;t even over HTTPS, so there is no encryption whatsoever).&nbsp; This includes the operators of the onion.to machine itself, and probably numerous government &quot;listening points&quot; within the Internet infrastructure.<br /><br />However, just because they CAN see it doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re paying attention.&nbsp; That said, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want to risk it.

				Hi,<br />I wanted to make my first post here because I can relate so much to this confusion and want to forewarn you before you make a big mistake.<br /><br />A little while ago my ex-boyf was in the same position. He heard from one of his friends about this drug marketplace and he google&#039;d SR and he used to access it through a .to extension thinking it was always safe.<br /><br />He started making orders from international sellers only worried about price and quality. He started off with personal amounts to be safe but then when a few of those came through, he thought he was untouchable so he upped the anti. 2 months and 5 semi bulk packages missing later there was a full blown raid at his house.<br /><br />They had been building a case up since the very first time that he got drugs ordered. They got his IP, were able to geographically link it to his address and linked all the mail going to the address ordered from SR. With around 10 packages which amounted to drugs way more than in the &quot;personal use&quot; category, he didn&#039;t even get a chance to get a &quot;what the fuck&quot; out, before he was pinned to the ground, his 2 dogs shot and his house turned inside out with 3 laptops of his and 2 belonging to his family members taken (all he would do was change which laptops he used, thinking that was being &quot;safe&quot;)<br /><br />So a warning to the wise. Always take your security as paramount. I try to put myself in the shoes of a paranoid meth tweaker or a high level crime boss. Whatever precautions they take for their safety, I take with mine.<br /><br />I suggest getting tails on a bootable USB (encrypted with truecrypt of course) and to always use security measures like Tor for your browsing, GPG for message encryption etc.<br /><br />When risk can be avoided easily, why do you want to take it unnecessarily and make life harder for&nbsp; yourself. My ex was absolutely stupid. He used his phone call (I assume they get one) on me. I heard his voice, told him to get a lawyer and just hung up. It hurt and I guess people and my ex hate me for it, but personal security is paramount<br /><br />TL;DR Safety is paramount. Use every safety and security feature you possibly can. I have an encrypted USB with Tails which I boot through a VM, spoofing my MAC address and only ever accessing internet off neighbors/public wi-fi with cheap $200-300 laptops that I can replace every month or so.

				miszkay is correct.<br />Do not use the onion.to browser. It is not tor, therefore it is not safe.<br />Please use tor in the future and always make sure you&#039;re accessing the correct websites before you input any sensitive information.<br />Also, read up on using pgp/gpg, and memorizing silkroad&#039;s url.<br />Be safe, good luck.

				I&#039;m new here too. Its easy to stress over something - anything.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you sent some redflags to the wrong people. But if you received the first gram, if I were you, I&#039;d ignore any future package that wasn&#039;t ordered on the TOR browser.<br /><br />I&#039;d also talk to my ISP and ask for a new IP before doing anything else related to TOR, SR, or even Bitcoin.

				staywavy72 you said you were in the tor browser but using the onion.to address? you should be fine if that&#039;s the case as the tor browser would have given you a new fake IP every time you opened it.

				morphjow is right. The TOR browser bundle would have given you a new fake IP each time you logged in. It&#039;s still not a smart move to use the onion.to link - those running the .to service could have access to your login credentials - but you definitely don&#039;t need to worry about a raid on your house. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious about the case involving miszkay&#039;s ex, even though I assume it&#039;s at least partially made up: if it were true, sharing the story publicly would be a far greater threat to her personal security than if she accessed TOR from her home network or something. (Also, I don&#039;t remembering hearing any SR related busts that involved two dogs being shot.) Was the ex - unlike the OP - not even using the TOR browser bundle? Who was the &quot;they&quot; who got his IP address?&nbsp; Local law enforcement? The DEA? Customs? And why assume his IP address had anything to do with it? Wouldn&#039;t it be more reasonable to think that Customs had started intercepting his packages and used them as evidence enough for a raid? I do think it&#039;s worth sorting out whether it was his computer use or the deliveries themselves that brought him down. If internet service providers are be turning over information about those even visiting SR through the .to service it&#039;s something people should know about.

				DO NOT USE ONION.TO SERVICES!<br /><br />They deanonymize you, and your ISP/LE can read everything you do on SR and other hidden services.<br />They also log your id/password, if they have bad intentions, they can log in to your account and withdraw all of your BTC.<br /><br />Again:<br />DO NOT USE ONION.TO SERVICES!<br /><br />Either use the Tor browser bundle or Tails or don&#039;t log in to Tor hidden services AT ALL (especially SR)!<br /><br />Since you already used the onion.to services, download the Tor browser bundle, access SR through that, and change your password and pin. <br />I&#039;d also change my userid by creating a brand new account. Any addresses you used for shipping should be considered compromised.

				I feel like some people didnt even read the part that i was in the tor browser bundle, but THANKS for those who did. answers are very reassuring, talked to the vendor and it just took him an extra day to ship it out and didnt get it out till night time. I am new here so the paranoia comes easy, i will take your advice and do all my btc deposits and orders from a diff IP. Thank you for the help guys!!!

				Anyone who hasn&#039;t heard of UglySurfer, and his Darknet extreme bootable usb stick&#039;s or machine&#039;s needs to make it a matter of urgency to look up this product on SR. <br /><br />The usb comes pre loaded with Ubuntu and has a virtual machine on it as well. The VM is in a truecrypt encrypted container, which is in turn is hidden in an outer container , also truecrypt encrypted.<br /><br />u get 2 passwords for this - the one which gives u access to the vm which you access TOR, and in turn SR from, and the password that opens the outer container, which just has a few files on it&#039;s ubuntu vm, nothing incriminating.<br /><br />It is fucking awesome! I realize there are no absolutes as far as security goes, especially having SR accounts and buying drugs go, however, I&#039;m more than happy to boot my machine from this usb stick, start a VM (which is connected to my home wi fi, but has a totally made up mac address and is also spoofed after that, as well as a made up ip address) get on TOR and SR and order drugs, or come here and talk with people about ordering drugs..<br /><br />Have only been on SR 3 months, but have spent 8500<br />&nbsp;bucks in 16 transactions, but the best transaction I made ( aside from 1/2 an ounce of meth from Kush) was the one where I spent 70 bucks on that usb stick!
