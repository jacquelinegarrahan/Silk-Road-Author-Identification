				Looking for advice on NBOMe from experienced users, like how long does it take to come on, how long does it last and how does it compare to LSD in the &quot;heads gone to mush&quot; type of way ? Any info appreciated, thanks.

				I&#039;d put the blotter in between my top teeth + gum, leave it there for like an hour.<br />It takes around 20 minutes to 2 hours to come up, and another 1-2 hours to peak.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried LSD yet so I can&#039;t really compare, but 25i-NBOMe is currently one of my fav drugs!

				NBOMes arent orally active like LSD is, so you can&#039;t just swallow it. Vladimir is right about putting it on your upper gum, but the most important part is making sure you don&#039;t swallow your saliva. NBOMes work best buccally which means you have to hold that nasty spit for at least 30 minutes to get the full effect.

				I ordered some 25i nbome from goodatbusiness before. Here is a link to his vendor page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/83a46a6a80<br /><br />I leave the tabs between my upper gum and my cheek for about 30 minutes making sure not to swallow your saliva. If you do don&#039;t worry too much about it you&#039;ll still normally trip if you do, but it&#039;s better not to.<br /><br />I took 1000ug for my first time it was perfect

				Have a question about redosing 25i. If I wanted to have a long long trip (like 8 hours or more), would dosing 1 tab, then redosing another tab (1000mg each) at the 4 hour mark result in a long extended trip or just be a waste of a dose?

				Thanks. I&#039;d assume it&#039;d be the same then. Usually works fairly for me with acid, so hopefully this will be the same. This will be my first 25i trip this weekend, can&#039;t wait! I&#039;ll let you guess know if the redose does work out well or not.

Personally, they just don&#039;t compare to LSD and shrooms. Maybe the stuff I had wasn&#039;t very good or clean, but the comedown everytime was pretty awful. The next day I&#039;d feel pretty bad. With LSD and shrooms I always feel very refreshed and energetic the day after a trip. In terms of the come up? It usually took about 20-40 minutes. Definitely peaking at a hour in. Depending on how much you do, the total duration can change. My trips usually lasted about 8-12 hours. In terms of the &quot;heads gone to mush&quot; I definitely think LSD is way safer than research chems but that&#039;s just how I feel.

You def trip your balls off on all subtances but all of them have there pros and cons<br /><br />In my opinion:<br />Festivals/Concerts/parties: 25i<br />group of people at a house chilling: lsd<br />group in the woods/mountains/nature basically: shrooms

				Would agree that there are many people with an inflated ego, but losing it because of acid is not much fun for anyone. <br />I&#039;m not saying LSD doesn&#039;t have its worth. Some scientists reckon it could be a valuable tool for those with certain mental illnesses, but given the absurdity of the whole prohibition thing, they can&#039;t get permission for human trials. Same with other illegals too. Some of them could well be more effective (in medical terms) than a lot of the bunk that gets subscribed, but given their legal status, there are just too many obstacles to overcome.

				For me an essential part of the LSD experience (of psychedelics in general) is getting my ass ready to be kicked. I love the fun and beauty LSD brings but all the things I learn through the trip about myself and the others are what makes the trip valuable. I consider I haven&#039;t had any really tough times on LSD but I think that&#039;s because I embrace it all. I&#039;ve shed some tears deep in the darkness but I&#039;ve always seen that kind of things as something beautiful. Take it as it comes!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried NBOMe yet, there&#039;s still a bunch of substances I have to try before. But I guess I&#039;ll get there eventually.

For me, it lead to chronic mental illness, which I still experience nearly 20 years after. And I had no idea when i took it that I was in any way at risk of mental illness, I just thought that any changes to personality I might experience would be positive. If I could go back i&#039;d never use this drug for recreation, but I know that many people do, and LOVE the effects. I guess it just depends on whether or not you&#039;re the 1 in 10, or whatever, who&#039;s brain chemistry is vulnerable to the drug.

				ok this is just my opinion so please dont pick too much on the details. <br /><br />the ego is just a stupid little invention made up by your mind. nobody gets born with an ego. the mind gets some unknown input and tries to make sense of it - a program developes over time, through interaction with other people. there is someone, that is not you, who tells you &quot;you did good, son!&quot; or &quot;you did bad!&quot;, all this &quot;you&quot; interaction with positive and negative feedback creates an &quot;I&quot;, whos solely purpose it is to try to fit into this society. it loves to be liked, it hates to be disliked and it does accumulate more and more automatic responses which are approiate or to be avoided in order to reach its goal. <br /><br />is this thing you? well, if you watch yourself closely, you often can spot your ego taking over and handling things for you and often not in your favor, in an argument for example. you could have acted differently but &quot;you&quot; didnt. this ego certainly has power over you. americans, nazi-germans, north koreans. they all got their egos shaped according to their society. leaders usually know how to shape peoples egos to fit their needs. the ego isnt all of you, it controls you and is easily manipulated from outside. eventually it can become something like cancer, always growing and turning you more and more into a robotic slave. there are whole science branches about how to shape and control your ego and they are getting pretty good at it. <br /><br />but people are more than that. people can think for themselves and chose how to respond to a situation if their ego doesnt get into their way. phenomena like ego death resets some of that &quot;static programming&quot; and allows you to grow beyond that. for me, life philosophies like buddhism are evidence of extensive wisdom and knowledge because they teach ways not to embrace your ego but to eventually drop it. they really understood how the machinery works, millenia before modern psychology.<br /><br />i think its one of the great discoveries of the new age drug culture that there are ways to change your personality. a somewhat spiritual emancipation where you get to chose who you are, not your surroundings. and this probably was one of the reasons why people like timothy leary were hysterically hunted down and criminalized. because they released a viral menace into society which had the potencial of &quot;killing&quot;, &quot;rewriting&quot; or whatever you call it peoples automated, systematically imprinted responses and could made them think for themselves. <br /><br />of course these days this era is all romantized, oversimplified and misunderstood. most people today think it was about long hair, drugs and getting layed and its no wonder that many came to the conclusion that psychedelica are just a dangerous, madness induced fantasy and nothing substancial. most people taking these drugs today have heard about some vague therapeutic potencial, some fancy artists but mostly just get high in a club, with lots of blinking lights and have no clue what these substances are capable of. which actually could be considered abuse, where the benefits not exactly outweight the risks.<br /><br />i think that many cases of psychedelica related psychosis happened not necessarily because of predisposition but simply because of lack of knowledge, wrong usage and resulting negative changes of the mind. this doesnt mean that some people were not &quot;smart enough&quot;, its just an example of how terribly wrong such a situation can end up. some accidently integrated chain reaction of nonsensical programmings, which makes peoples minds spin in endless circles, getting them more and more detached from reality in an upward spiral. psychology cant do much about it either, except freezing the whole circuit medically and hoping it doesnt get activated somehow again.<br /><br />my ideal would be to actually help this person to break out of this chain reaction by himself. to show him whats delusion and how to get into the right direction to slowly reverse the spiral towards reality until he actually reaches baseline again. along with ways to overwrite parts of this faulty programming, so it isnt a ticking bomb anymore and i bet NO pill is going to do that for you. its a primitive idea to fix a highly complex, self-programming system like that. but it is effective? sure, cant argue with results. electroshocks are also considered an effective therapy and a bang on the head is probably a pretty effective narcotic too. doesnt mean its an elegant way to solve problems though or that we have much of any idea what we are doing. <br /><br />we hopefully will at some point finally start assembling the instruction manuals with thorough research of psychedelic substances, accumulated insights, developement of new therapy methods and cultural rituals to make the next evolutionary step in culture and science in order to develope adequate, modern solutions for mental problems and finally get on our path of true, spiritual emancipation. all that what has been forcefully denied to us since over 50 years by of our beloved leaders.<br />

				So I&#039;m just throwing in my experience on 25i,<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways, about over a week ago I got my 25i NBOMe&#039;s and took them now and then, until 5 days ago I took a blotter and a half, which was approximately 1800ug. I proceeded to smoke a joint (I haven&#039;t smoked weed in 3 weeks, and 3 weeks ago I had only smoked a couple of times, before that, 6 months clean, so it really hit me good).<br /><br />Anyways, after a while, I was just really high, and decided to eat a bag of chips, upon eating, I realized, I could not feel my body. I could not feel my face. But I kept on eating. I finally realized, that my &quot;framerate&quot; was so slow, what I was seeing, and what I had felt, were completely off sync.<br /><br />I began losing my trait of thought and became really confused. I felt sick, I tried rubbing my face to see if I could still control myself, and I felt like I was actually Schizophrenic. My reaction was so slow to things that I thought I was schizophrenic and another persona of myself is controlling myself. I was getting worried because I thought it was not possible since I was still conscious, but it genuinely felt like someone else was controlling me, I was shit scared if I stood up and went around the house doing shit, but thankfully I remained in my room.<br /><br />I have never been this scared, I had never taken NBOMe with weed and it had been so long since I smoked. I layed on my bed, stared at the walls and my vision was typically like a NBOMe trip (25i), there were strange spots around me, warping walls... Tons of colors and tracers, its like &quot;snow vision&quot; with the whole pallet of colours off the rainbow...&nbsp; anyways things began to slow down even more. I began recalling muscle memory, this may sound weird but when I twitched my face, or moved my lips, it felt like someone was out there pulling my face and doing it to me (involuntary movements). Have you seen videos of something played backwards? lets say someone is talking and the video is played backwards and his face movements seem odd and silly, or a ball hitting someones face played backwards, I felt like the ball had hit me and returned to the person who threw it with my face feeling fucking weird. I thought my mom was doing it to me (Moving my lips and face), The movements just felt really involuntary.<br /><br />But really I was just really out of it. I got scared that I was going to be brain damaged, I remember before knocking out (Thank GOD the weed helped me sleep, even on NBOMe.. but it was still the mix of the two that fucked me up) I was staring at the wall blankly, I couldn&#039;t hold a thought, I didn&#039;t know what I was, had visions of the universe, how insignificant I was.. Next I either had a dream while knocked out or right before it, but I felt like &quot;God&quot; or an entity with more power and intelligence that was governing the universe was showing me what I really was. It was like I was some kind of ball of energy, and it was persuading me that this IS reality, this is what you really are; The world and your body is nothing like what is lies beyond. And I layed there trying to accept this reality, this way of thinking, this &quot;new perspective&quot; at the time...<br /><br />While I was going through that I was just scared, really worried, but I told myself, just knock out, sleep, you will be ok later, you&#039;re just really really fucking high.. and eventually I woke up and everything was back to normal...<br /><br />Sorry if this made almost no sense, but this was my weird ass experience with 25i and weed, I think it was really because I&#039;ve never smoked in a while and I&#039;m used to smoking weak brick weed... meh If I were to take 25i alone itself, I can enjoy it a lot more, max I&#039;ve taken was 3000ug in one night and I had a great time. The only think I don&#039;t like about 25i is when you have shit cigarettes or nothing to keep your mouth busy like gum. The taste of 25i just lingers and I keep on swallowing my own saliva to satisfy some kind of &quot;urge&quot;.<br /><br />Although I&#039;ve got some weed coming late this week or monday, I&#039;m going to try mixing the two again, because i&#039;m not convinced it will happen again unless I smoke a fuckload or I take the 25i right after my first joint since my tolerance will be in the toilet again... I regret taking them at night though, Always end up sleeping late as fuck and waking up in the afternoons...

				I was really excited to try nbomes as I&#039;d heard so many great things. My allergy test of 50ug 25B insuf went fine. But my first real trial at 400ug resulted at first in euphoria/spaciness and visual/color enhancement. But i got freaked out because my thumb started twitching totally beyond my body&#039;s control for periods of about 30 seconds every 20 minutes or so.

				My only experience with NBOMes so far has been with 700ug of 25i.&nbsp; I left it between my gum and upper lip for about 30 minutes, until the taste was gone. I think I&#039;ll try my gum and cheek next time.&nbsp; I took around 1-2 hours to come up. I&#039;m not sure exactly how long the come up took since I didn&#039;t start having visuals until I left my house and went outside. I had a pretty good day, I mostly took long walks and enjoyed the visuals. Mentally I felt somewhat sober, like I could act normal around people, but I was also thinking about mathematical concepts/nature/the universe/fractals, and I found I was able to comprehend more than I could normally.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t very introspective however, I didn&#039;t really think about myself and my life, but more about external events. It lasted around 12 hours in total, though the peak lasted around 4-5 hours. Next time I&#039;ll probably try around 1000ug.

				It&#039;s not at all like LSD. That being said, it wrecks your view of reality, and can be incredibly intense, and interesting experience, but not similar to LSD at all. It&#039;s true what people said about not swallowing your spit, just keep everything in your mouth for about 30-60 minutes.

				Hi everybody, I&#039;ve experimented a fair bit with 25i and hope i can provide some interesting observations for you all; the first few tries were at low dosages either side of MDMA usage, and both myself and two others had no real noticeable effects - possibly because the tabs were uncomplexed. No wories though, as they were cheap as chips and we had some more on the way. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The net set of tabs arrived, and we thought we&#039;d sit down and play a board game while we waited for what we expected to be similar to the last time, only at a stronger dose. This was a mistake, as we now had 1500-2000ug each. shortly after taking these tabs we were all feeling overwhelmed and had to relocate outside to the dark, rainy night, where we experienced our first full fledged psychedelic journey. barely able to see more than 5 foot ahead of us, we stumbled up hills, through the woods and around some ponds. The wet, dark conditions were extremely exaggerated by the drug, and I suspect if it hadn&#039;t all been so fun we would have classed this as a bad trip, regardless of the neon grid printed into our retinas, and the perception of the wind as clear, ringing trumpets.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After relocating indoors and calming slightly we noticed the introspective, mental aspects of this drug. we were able to analyse our thoughts almost objectively, and even &#039;climb back&#039; through the ladder of thoughts we were each hurtling down. Listening to music we noticed the tone and energy of the music was very influential to the mood of the group, and that the residual visual effects were very similar to LSD, only that they were more structured and less situational; a personal example is the difference in the way i percieve clouds on the two drugs. LSD takes the clouds and moulds them to look more like your imagination, helping you identify forms and alter them, while 25i rendered the clouds into particular blossoming patterns that stayed uniform across my vision. This is only my personal experience however. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since that very powerful trip, I have only taken 1000ug max, and I find this dose to be very funky; providing excellent colour saturation and neon vibes, as well as a general increase in mood, without the mind-blowing thought typhoon that I previously experienced. One of my friends has again taken the same stronger dose during a sunny day, and found it manageable, while the other has experimented with lower doses, and found it a pleasant augment, similar to low doses of LSD.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />These are my experiences with 25i-Nbome, and the observations i have had, particularly contrasting to LSD, something I consider to be the benchmark of psychedelics, I&#039;ve enjoyed reading about other people&#039;s experiences and hope to see a few more people sharing theirs. Thanks! <br /><br />ps. does anybody else find that a day or two after removing blotters from between the gum and the lip that they get a single layer of dead skin that just peels off? it&#039;s pretty disgusting and i wondered if this is just from rough tab edges or something in the chemical?

				Thanks for the input bud Ive had similar problems with the dead skin and just assumed that it was the chemical as it is a pretty ferocious taste at first when you put then in your mouth.

				I&#039;m a newbie who just placed his first order. I mainly ordered acid, but had some spare coins so I also placed an order for a few tabs of NBOMe. I&#039;ll probably wait a while before trying them, as I&#039;m eager to try the LSD first. But that depends on what shows up first in the mail, I hope at least one of the letters arrive in time for the next weekend (can&#039;t trip weekdays as I&#039;m really busy at work this time of the year). According to the vendor, the tabs are 1500 ug, perhaps a bit too strong for someone who has never tried NBOMes before? Suppose I&#039;ll try half at first.<br /><br />Great reading your experiences. :)

				Yeah, I wasn&#039;t too concerned about the dead skin thing, but it certainly puts my mind at ease knowing it&#039;s not just me. I&#039;ll definitely agree about the ferocious taste, something like battery acid that you can taste running down your front tooth and numbing the tip of your tongue and most of your mouth for a while. <br /><br />Yes, Reely, I&#039;d go for a half first; I think my friends and me kinda jumped in at the deep end, and although we had a fantastically fun and terrifying trip, I think we may have missed out on some of the magic by starting off with a big dose. I think in doses of about 500-750ug it would make for a lovely chilled walkabout in the sun without the rough comeup and chaotic atmosphere we&#039;ve become accustomed to. <br /><br />also worth mentioning is that one of my friends who really cannot stand the taste of the stuff had some success with only keeping it under his tongue until he could barely taste it. he seemed to still get the majority of the dose with complexed blotters, so this may be a bit of a workaround the bad taste. luckily the stuff is so cheap that we can afford to experiment a bit&nbsp; :)
