				my multibit wallet is showing &#039;this transaction is being confirmed&#039;. and there is a little green clock/circle half filled. nothing is showing in my sr account yet tho.<br /><br />what would happen if my wifi cut out for a minute or so? would the funds just go back to multibit wallet and show as transaction couldn&#039;t be completed or something?

				Never used multibit before, but transaction confirmations take place over the blockchain, not on your end. It can actually take up to 24 hours if you&#039;re really unlucky, but usually it will be within 2 hours. I&#039;ve personally seen them appear in my SR account practically instantly, but also waited ~6 hours, so it&#039;s kind of a crap shoot.

				Keep in mind that SR has its own tumbler, so that will add to the normal time a bit. And it varies based on the tumblers algorithims and shit.

				The time it takes is going to range...&nbsp; You have a server with thousands of users, running in tor which isn&#039;t the quickest network,&nbsp; running how many automated processes in CRON based scheduled jobs.&nbsp;
