				They do seem very relaxed about Atlantis being offline though. One announcement in 24 hours, and still their publicity claims they&#039;re &quot;better than the competition&quot; because of &quot;no downtime&quot;.<br /><br />I guess the next competitor to SR will just have to run their site properly. And competition should be good for the market, so it&#039;d be a shame to see Atlantis fold.

				I think Atlantis looks and works great. I think BMR is not as good but it&#039;s better than nothing. Listen up just because you like SR better doesn&#039;t mean you have to insult any and all competition. Silk Road is the grandaddy and will always be so. But new upstarts bring fresh blood and new customers and vendors.

				I used to work in internet security before I was forced into retirement by a disability. I was telling one of my best friends, about a month back, that I was considering using either SR or Atlantis and he insinuated to me that he had evidence that Atlantis was financially backed by the DEA and would soon fold, cash in their BitCoin balance, then turn all their records over to federal prosecutors as state&#039;s evidence in exchange for total immunity.&nbsp; When he told me that, I began to look at Atlantis in a different light.<br /><br />SilkRoad is an established business and has turned out to be a gold mine for our dear friend DPR. There is no way I&#039;m going to risk losing any money or information to Atlantis. While I sincerely hope that those who have done business with them are able to conclude transactions and cash out monies with them, they ARE an unproven establishment and should be dealt with as such. <br /><br />Stick with SilkRoad, friends. Until Atlantis has proven itself, as the infamous Mike Brady would say, &quot;Caveat emptor‎.&quot;

				I find the rumor that atlantis couldve been run by the dea very interesting.But theres a larger point here.I have very good faith in DPR and SR but if it ever should go down,someone else (who is legit)would open up another marketplace just like it.Once the technology exists,theres no going back.Its just a cat and mouse game.The cops are well aware of that,and thats why I think they dont spend much time or effort worrying about SR.Sure they might make some tough statments in public.But think about it.People get pretty large amounts of drugs shipped to there house and if it gets seized,all they do is send a letter.If they really wanted to spend LE time and money to prosecute people do you really think they would have to setup a fake site on tor and spend all that time,when they already have a huge list of people they could prosecute if they wanted to?It just doesn&#039;t make sense to me.Tell me where i&#039;m wrong.

				Atlantis gives you the option of using Litecoin also. I bought a few of them many months ago, and it came in handy to be able to use them on that site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made around 3-4 purchases from there, and not a problem.

				I loved Atlantis.&nbsp; Vendors with slightly lower prices and the time on their hands to ship your order immediately.<br />I hope that adventure_time comes to the road and reveals what he planned as today&#039;s offering on Atlantis. <br />Damn, I miss that dude.
