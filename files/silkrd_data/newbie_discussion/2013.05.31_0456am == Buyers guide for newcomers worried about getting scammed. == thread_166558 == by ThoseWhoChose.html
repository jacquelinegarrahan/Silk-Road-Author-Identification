				Alright, you just got some BTC and just made an account on SR but you run into the fact you have 0 buys and 0 reputation and chances are everyone will ask to finalize the money early so they don&#039;t get scammed, but infact sometimes they could possible scam you. <br /><br />First of all your already taking a risk getting a package through the mail so you shouldn&#039;t be on this website if your way too worried about risk. We all take risk in life no matter what we do. Sticking to the best sellers with the best reputation to get your first few buys so you can have rep is a good start. <br /><br />Also read around and see what other people have to say with the search option on the forum, and looking through pages of feedback helps a lot. Perfect example of a scammer is greendaddy888 selling fake ass pills. Originally he listed them as they were real, and as soon as people caught on he made sure he got enough orders then he created other listings that say fake pills. Fucking stupid if you ask me people still buy from him and he has a 60 rating.<br /><br />&nbsp;Stick to the reputation system as you can obviously tell who is legit and who is not. But there&#039;s always a chance someone who builds up a reputation will turn on everyone and start ripping off people, something really hard to avoid but the chances are pretty low. Like I said, risks you have to take, nothing is 100% certain in life. in the past 4 months I&#039;ve spent over 2000 USD on about 28 transactions and each transaction was successful. <br /><br />If you do things right chances are you won&#039;t have to fuck with the refund system, leaving a percentage for your refunds which some sellers don&#039;t really like dealing with people who possibly scam. So it&#039;s up to you and you have every tool available to make sure the percentage of losing money is much lower then if you just randomly purchase an item without looking at any of the information in front of you. Anyone got anything to add? Please feel free to.

				When I got my first round of BTC in my account, I bought 6 eBooks/audio books. I spent like 5 bucks and got 6 completed transactions out of it. After doing this, vendors can see that I have completed purchases which went smoothly, and were much happier to deal with me.<br /><br />Good way to build up your buyer stats so vendors will take you seriously.

				That is very true, E-books is a way to go. But I can see a scammer just investing little coin to build up rep on samples and then scamming vendors. There&#039;s always a chance for that type of thing.

				Also, i&#039;d like to add something. NEVER EVER GIVE OUT your address to someone claiming to be a vendor on the forum if they do not have a account on SR. Someone named Charlie Sheen tried to extort 1 BTC off me by saying he was going to expose a address I gave him. Luckly it was a fake one I wanted to see if he was actually scamming or not. Turns out he was a failed scammer and for what he did not only did he get his personal information exposed he truly got fucked over. Remember go with people with rep!

You can keep your money in escrow and potentially get it back if the product doesn&#039;t arrive or is bunk. For any future LSD order, I&#039;d pay attention to the Avengers forum - which keeps people up to date of what is good, bad, or indifferent. And sometimes it&#039;s worth paying a little extra for the security. And for getting some acid that will blow your mind :)

				There&#039;s a simple formula for a successful transaction. <br /><br />No FE + Reputable vendor with a rating of 99 to 100% + Consumer reviews that show the product was good and shipped in a safe, timely manner = Successful Transaction.<br /><br />That&#039;s all you need. Study the vendor&#039;s pages and review threads diligently. Compare them with others that sell the drug you want. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />And encrypt your address, using your real name.

See this as an example of the absolute shit that get started in these situations (for buyers and vendors) if you want to read like 6 pages of discussion: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161293.0&nbsp; <br />That being said, certainly finalize in a timely manner. Waiting for auto-finalization will get you sent to at least the 3rd circle of hell.<br /><br />ThoseWhoChose, I guess that post is kind of relevant to you too. I also got scammed with one of my first purchases, naively FE-ed before I&#039;d discovered the forums. The vendor was offering a whole bunch of cheap stimulants and had like a 99 or 100% rating because people were just giving 5/5 as they finalized early. But all I looked at was the high rating number, and the cheap price. So after that unfortunate adventure I learned to read through all the reviews on the vendor page and the forums, and even if they are great I generally don&#039;t FE. <br />

				I&#039;ve found that a little research will find you some fine vendors that do not require FE, ya just gotta put in the time.&nbsp; Granted, there&#039;s only sa few different products I buy, but I don&#039;t know why things would b different with other products. There&#039;s all kinda shit on here that I have no clue even what they are. Especially those drugs that just have letters and numbers for names. I guess I&#039;m oldschool, I started inj the 80&#039;s and settled on some of the golden oldies that I like, weed, blow, opiates....etc.&nbsp; I gtot no clue what that shit that looks like this......2ocmbe?????whatever the fuck,,,,,,is.
