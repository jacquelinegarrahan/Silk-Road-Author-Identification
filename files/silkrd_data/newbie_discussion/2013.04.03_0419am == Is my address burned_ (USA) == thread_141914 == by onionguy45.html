				Hi, so I ordered some bud a few weeks ago. I&#039;m 17 and so I still live with my parents. I thought it would be no big deal and the post man would leave the package in the mailbox - nope. It went straight to my dad from the postman before I could get home. He called the fucking cops on me, and of course I denied everything, and they came to the conclusion that someone else sent it to me. My dad was relieved when I told him it was me, though. I left no hard evidence and it&#039;s been two weeks since the incident and it seems like it blew over. The package was not seized/intercepted at the post office and it got to my house unmolested until my dad started freaking out. It was addressed to my name though. I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s safe for me to order some LSD (domestic). Thanks in advance.

				My thought would be do not order to that address again. Better safe than sorry.

				i would not risk having this happen again. your address has probably not been flagged since this is only one incident that this has happened. i would use a friends house that is okay with receiving packages of illegal drugs in his mail. but this is just my advice as this happened to a friend of mine before and he now uses a friends house to send packages to. nothing bad has happened to any of the packages he has ordered to that address since he started to use that address about 3 months ago.

				Is there any way to find out if your name/address have been flagged? Again, I wanted to order some lucy so you know how stealthy the shipping should be. Does USPS dig through ALL MAIL that flagged persons recieve?

				USPS is controlled by the government and can not open a package without a warrant to the address the package was sent to. they can however, open packages if there is anything suspicious about the package...such as an odor (could have been the reason your bud got caught) or something leaking from the package. and i do not know if there is anyway to find out if your address has been flagged. but again, i would NOT risk sending anything to your address. find a friend that is okay with receiving those kind of packages in the mail...your address might be flagged, it might not. do not take the chance and send anything else to your address....<br /><br />PS. they can also open packages if they go through the xray scanner and they see the substance inside<br />

				Well, the bud got to my address unmolested, and it was my dad who called the police, believing that someone is trying to &quot;frame&quot; me.

				It would be unlikely that the cops would flag the address if they were just regular street patrol, to get flagged I would think that the package would have to get detected while in the hands of the USPS.&nbsp; If your concerned though, do what&#039;s been suggested and ship to a friend who agrees.&nbsp; Also better than ending up in your dads hands again.

				then it is possible that the mailman had smelled the bud through the package and brought it to the door. while the postal service might not have noticed it during shipping or just did not give a fuck about it and just let it pass through. and as stated by nameviolated just now, if they were regular street patrol...your house would not have been flagged. my friends house had been flagged because of an intercepted package of mdma found going through an xray scan..this is why he uses his friends house who is willing to take the risk of his house being flagged by LE

				i would talk to the vendor... some do use some pretty good stealth, and i think even if your parents opened it they wouldn&#039;t know. or order some chocolates with mushies in it, or some other type of edible if you really want to trip. they would never know. <br /><br />don&#039;t forget if you are talking to the vendor about their packaging techniques it might be best to encrypt the message. <br /><br /><br />good luck! ;)

				The LSD would probably have less conspicuous stealth, so even if they were looking at your mail it would just seem like some mail. You run a risk if you do not regularly receive mail though.

				If the mailman delivered the package there was nothing wrong on the seller&#039;s end.<br /><br />If USPS finds the package you either get a love letter or worst case an attempted controlled delivery.&nbsp; But once it gets to the point of being in the truck out for delivery you have passed the screening process.<br /><br />From what I understand your dad saw a package addressed to you and opened it?&nbsp; So it sounds like a minor with noisy parents.<br /><br />A personal amount of weed is not a big deal in many areas of the USA.&nbsp; But being caught with LSD is a felony OP.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD is the easiest drug to ship and is undetectable to drug dogs but if your dad opens your mail I would not risk it.&nbsp; LSD blotters will look like something, your dad just might not know what. <br />

				yea, i agree... you&#039;re 17 and living with parents... why don&#039;t you wait at least till you&#039;re out of the house?!?&nbsp; you can be out on your own at 18, right?&nbsp; then you can do all the stupid shit you want without worrying about your dad fucking it up.&nbsp; you&#039;ll be solely responsible for your actions... and you won&#039;t involve anyone else in them.&nbsp; <br />
