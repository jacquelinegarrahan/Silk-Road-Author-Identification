				Hello all.<br />Iv been looking into ordering from MDMAte but have noticed there is little presence of this vendor on the forums,<br />And it says he was last &#039;&#039;seen&#039;&#039; today though the vendors last update stated on his profile was a yr ago but the vendor is still got listing up,recent feedback<br /><br />I feel a little uneasy about this, Any advice on the situation or recent reviews on this vendor would be helpful in making an informed decision.<br /><br />MDMAte http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/78bc425f36<br /><br />Thank you in advance (I hope)

				looks like he is open for shop based on the feedback. unfortunate if he doesn&#039;t have a thread in the forums. did you try searching his username?<br />sometimes people just get lazy and don&#039;t update there profile. i would ask him questions if your wondering anything or want up to date info.<br />theres lots of other sellers with those products too. i&#039;m not sure where your at but he is all the way in germany

				Thanks Robloblaw <br />I have searched for them in the forums but not much too recent from themand in fact very little from them at all on here.<br /><br />Im in America, Been searching for good XTC pills for awhile but cant seem to find any domestically for a good price.<br />I am a little hesitant about ordering internationally but as I said they have the best prices <br />Iv heard about the orange redbulls id love to get my hands on some<br /><br />I was at first before researching going to order from marijuanaismymuse, xtcexpress, or supertrips but saw that they are all recognized selective scammers. And SP requires FE which im staying away from,<br />Though mdmate says they might require FE. If they do I can just cancel or have them cancel order right?<br /><br />Had to repost this 3 times damnit cause an error had occurred when trying to post that is a bit aggravating.<br />Anyone else had this problem?<br /><br />Thank you again Robloblaw, Its nice to have more than one opinion on the matter<br />All advice/opinion is greatly appreciated. <br /><br />

				Yeah I feel the same way about ordering from the netherlands specially for what Im looking for.<br />Im mainly interested in XTC pills for now as Iv had my fair share of mdma plus I can find that locally. <br />Though I always have to test like 5 different peoples stuff and normally tell 4 out of 5 of them off because people around here have this ignorant conception that what they have is &#039;&#039;fire&#039;&#039; mdma just cause they have rock/crystals.<br />So I&#039;ll definitely be grabbing some off here in the near future, A little piece of mind would be a wonderful thing and fuck driving all around town to turn most people down.<br /><br />WOW I totally retyped that 3 times and forgot some of what I was saying in the frustration of it all.<br />Didnt think thatd work lol damn I need to not instill doubt in any ideas before trying them out<br />Thank you so much for that information

				Chemical Brothers has pretty good stealth for pills.<br />Why not get some pure MDMA and impress your buddies with some good white?&nbsp; I think Googleeyed has some nice stuff.
