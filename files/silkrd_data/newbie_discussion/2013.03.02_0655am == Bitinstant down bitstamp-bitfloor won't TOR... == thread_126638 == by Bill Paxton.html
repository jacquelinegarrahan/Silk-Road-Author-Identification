But in the middle of the night on a Friday I can understand why you&#039;re surprised no one has responded in under 90 minutes.<br /><br />&nbsp;::)<br /><br />Real advice: do a search and you will find approximately 490283094 threads about this. BitInstant has been useless for weeks now. The alternatives are discussed in many threads. If you&#039;re in SE USA, you probably are near a BoA, which is the choice of many other exchanges. You will have plenty of options. If there isn&#039;t a BoA near you, then like me, your options are unfortunately very limited until BitInstant decides to get it together (although at this point I don&#039;t think I will ever use them again).

				I&#039;d recommend Bitcopia, I used it on Friday, it was honestly much easier than using bitinstant, and I feel like it was more anonymous, (everything pretty much done through email never had to give my name or fake name).

You can never be too safe, it is best to cover all trails as I am terrified of spending even one day in prison.

Had to allow quite a few things with noscript. How good does bitcopia work with tor?

				THANK YOU SO MUCH for your responses.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using bitfloor and they&#039;re solid as fuck.&nbsp; Cash shows up in my account before I make it back to my computer from BOA and then I quickly convert/trade to BTC and upload to my SR account.&nbsp; I&#039;m using ALL fake names and they havent asked for ID at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m comfortable sending straight to SR from BitFloor since every name I use is false. <br /><br />Any comments/suggestions on this? Am planning on using a different email/user name for every other transaction or so just to be safe. <br /><br />Bitinstant still has over 400.00 of mine that I transfered to them AFTER the hack... they&#039;ve responded to my emails and also answered the phone once when I called, telling me everytime my money is safe and they&#039;re processing everything by hand... I&#039;m nervous I&#039;ll never see that money again but would feel much worse if they hadn&#039;t been responding at all to me. <br /><br /><br /><br />-BP<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve changed my BTC address a few times now since doing this bitinstant order that STILL hasn&#039;t come through (They are still in contact with me and keep assuring me they&#039;re going to give me my BTC). If I place an order using a BTC address and change that address before the funds come in, they will still get to my account correct? I saw this question posted in a FAQ somewhere but didn&#039;t read the response and I can&#039;t seem to find it. I assumed with the well thought out very detailed order to everything BTC it wouldn&#039;t be a problem at all but wanted to post/ask just to make sure as I can&#039;t find an answer to my question on the internet thingy. <br />
