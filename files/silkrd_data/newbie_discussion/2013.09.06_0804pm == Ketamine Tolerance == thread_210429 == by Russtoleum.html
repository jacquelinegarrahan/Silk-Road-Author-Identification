				Title: <strong>Ketamine Tolerance</strong><br />

				I honestly didn&#039;t do more than a general search for this and didn&#039;t find anything so I hope this isn&#039;t a repost as i know that tends to upset a forum community. Of the research i have done on this i have learned about the quick and persistent nature of the ketamine tolerance. That being said, I am still curious how John Lilly was able to take it constantly for 100 days straight (it was in an interview i read) and still feel the effects without overdosing. I recently purchased 2 grams of the powder myself and quickly realized how much i love ketamine, so i quickly went into a &#039;i need to stretch this out as long as i can&#039; mode. This worked for the first two days, i could keep taking small bumps and the most desirable effects of the drug would continue. The third day and with the same amount (approx 50 to 100mg) the effect wasn&#039;t as intense, more of a background high. After reading about the tolerance and how it is a delicate dance i decided to abstain for a week before i finished off the .5 grams i had left. <br /><br />So I&#039;m just looking for other peoples opinions and experiences with the drug and their tolerance. I&#039;m just curious if i buy 2 more grams will i only get the desired plateau a couple of times instead of the several i got so far this batch or if i wait a month will i be close to normal. Basically my worry is to be forever tolerant of ket or just as bad, it takes a gram to just have a good time, i don&#039;t think i have ever k-holed.

				To overcome tolerance people have to take larger and larger doses which eventually leads to bladders problems or other side effects.&nbsp; Some people are much more prone to those problems than others.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious: what is it that you like about ketamine?&nbsp; I loved it at first but don&#039;t enjoy it anymore unless I&#039;m high off something else.&nbsp; Frankly I&#039;ve had some very scarey experiences.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t worth taking it every day even when it is good...just to much risk.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad that I&#039;ve gotten to enjoy ketamine in the past and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll occasionally enjoy it in the future.<br /><br />Do you have racemic or S+ isomer?

				well I havent tried ketamine but I do think our bodies create a tolerance to many drugs Ive tried MXE which I heard was similar as it is a dissociative and the more bumps I did, I didnt feel it as much kept on doing it and didnt feel more intensity.

				I do a good amount of ketamine and I just recently realized how strong the tolerance can get.&nbsp; I say waiting a week or so usually does it for me.&nbsp; I only snort it though I don&#039;t inject it.

				K tolerance can get stupidly high... watch out with&nbsp; that&nbsp; stuff...<br />there are serious problems emerging in the UK for long term users, serious problems... in moderation though it won&#039;t trouble your cause

				You can reach a stage with ketamine use where you&#039;re able to take pretty large amounts and still function - to a degree. You&#039;re wasted, but you can get out of bed, shower, go to the shops, cook, communicate with others etc. You shouldn&#039;t be driving a car, and don&#039;t expect to hold down a job, but you can be on a gram a day or more and still live a reasonable enough life.<br /><br />It&#039;s a very odd drug in that respect. I spent 6 months on it in my 20&#039;s, then one day whilst on it, I just decided to stop. It was a full on trip in which I re-evaluated myself, my position in life, my goals and so on.<br /><br />I have taken it maybe 10-15 times since then, and haven&#039;t ever felt the urge to get back on it.

My mind was fully detached from my body, and I felt like I was living different lives in different places. It&#039;s like I was a character in a movie, and anything around me could change the scene. Everything from the music (which for some reason I prefer kind of &#039;dark and sombre&#039; house music, with very low pitch and high bass), a smell of a girls hair, a look, a face (if I could recognize one LOL I was with my friend who was dancing right next to me and I could not distinguish who the fuck he was :D ). <br />Every now and then I&#039;d turn to my friend and ask him where the fuck we were lol?! I felt as if I could interpret the thoughts of people around me. Some random guy showed up with a joint, he said he had arrived from Amsterdam and had brought it with him, he offered, what a guy!we happily smoked, unbeknownst to the fact that weed intensifies ket. Some time passes, and my friend turns to me a bit worried and asks if the guy could have had laced the weed.. The thought had crossed my mind, as I was tripping a lot harder than before! But I shook of the idea and kept dancing and swimming in my mind. My friend said we shouldnt take more ket we were both tripping too hard and we knew it.<br />I saw the sun start to rise behind the DJ booth. How long have we been here? I was at a crazy mind state, but I I still decided to bump once more. I knew it was gonna be too much, but still wanted to push it. I ask my friend where the fuck we were, again lol! He says he&#039;s plateauing, more controlled. He asks a bit worried if I had taken another bump? I said yes and he was like why would you do that lol? What felt like a long time later, I knew I&#039;d had enough. I had had my dose of crazy and wanted a reality check. We proceeded to leave. And as I started to walk from the dance floor to the entrance, I could barely walk! I had to hold on to chairs and walls because I felt that every step I took was going be the &#039;wrong one&#039;. It was so strange haha! It was like every step I took, I got that feeling one gets when you miss a step going up some stairs, but I got that feeling for every step! I literally felt like I was crossing a river walking over small stepping stones, with the feeling of freefall on every step. (sorry if this makes no sense lol, i hope some can relate) I was punching back into reality one step at a time. It was like all my muscle memory was gone.<br />We finally leave, walked to the hotel at 0.05km/h, trying to express everything. but cannot even formulate a full sentence. we are lost for words. After we got in, were definitely more sober, in the afterglow stage, and we realized we had been at that party for about 2 hours 30 minutes lol! We were actually shocked. we couldn&#039;t believe it. If i had to quantify the time i felt i was there, i would say at least 8 hours. and i think we did about 0.5-0.7g each.<br /><br />I really hope someone can relate with this. most trip reports are always about k-holes. never been one myself.<br /><br />sorry for the ramble and thanks for those who read it all lol. my intention was merely to ask the first line of my post, but weed wrote everything below it :P .<br /><br />good vibes.<br />LL
