It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium, in 1966, where it was prepared initially in the form of its racemate (called tetramisole).[1]The two stereoisomers of tetramisole were subsequently synthesized,[2] and the levorotatory isomer was given the name levamisole. Levamisole has been used in humans to treat parasitic worm infections, and has been studied in combination with other forms of chemotherapy for colon cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect.[3] The drug was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2000 and 2003, respectively, due to the risk of serious side effects and the availability of more effective replacement medications.[4][5] The key toxic effect of the drug is agranulocytosis, a severe depletion of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to infection.<br />Currently, levamisole remains in veterinary use as a dewormer for livestock. The medication has also been increasingly used as an adulterant in cocaine sold in the US and Canada, resulting in serious side effects.<br /><br />Published on: April 26 2013<br />Tested by: PineappleLove<br />Vendor: 10toes<br />Listed as: &quot;Premium Fishscale Cocaine&quot;<br />Purchasing method: Anonymous<br />Results:<br />48% Cocaine<br />46% Levamisole<br />6% Caffeine

				Everything I&#039;ve read and my own experience would indicate that the lev. is being added well up the food chain, possibly at the source. By the time it get&#039;s to mid-level dealers like the one&#039;s on SR it&#039;s already in the brick. I doubt many of the vendors on here even know whether their stuff is cut with it. Hopefully, more of them will start using EZTest to screen what they buy. Once the&nbsp; cut shit stops moving whoever is responsible for adding it is going realize it&#039;s bad for business.

				This shit...just wow. Fuck, maybe I&#039;m just naive but this is just evil! Nearly half the ingredients in this stuff is this Levamisole then. Do the others that were tested have this much in them?? Why are they cutting it with this instead of something inert, I assume the Levamisole has some effects which maybe mimic cocaine and that&#039;s why? <br />I mean, they shouldn&#039;t cut it at all, but what&#039;s stopping them from using something harmless, maybe a wee bit of speed if they want to fake it...sorry if this is all dead naive, I&#039;m not really that into coke.

				Yes I too would like to know &#039;why&#039; they use levamisole?&nbsp; Does anyone know?<br /><br />Although I think you are overreacting a little mauiguy,&nbsp; and targeting a vendor &#039;specifically&#039; for this cut in their coke is naive at best!&nbsp; Seriously it&#039;s common knowledge cutting often occurs higher up the food chain, so &#039;blaming&#039; a vendor like this iis not going to make folks either &#039;listen&#039; to what you have to say, plus it only makes you appear as an unbalanced hothead!<br /><br />&nbsp; It seems you didn&#039;t think this one through! Coming in here and attacking a vendor is poor form bro, where&#039;s the link to your initial &#039;review&#039; once you got the product eh?<br /><br />You could still make the same statement about &#039;coke being cut with levamisole&#039; in general, without &#039;singling out&#039; a specific vendor! <br /><br />Washing cuts out of dope is good BUT if the&nbsp; coke is 50% cut, it kinda fucks the whole deal up,&nbsp; dont you think?&nbsp; Why buy coke you NEED to clean?<br /><br />IDK but &#039;theXchanges&#039; coke has been REALLY NICE!&nbsp; What &#039;real&#039; coke is like, maybe a little pricey for some but not for here!<br /><br />just our 3 satoshi&#039;s worth;)<br /><br />mixed magic man motek

				An acetone wash will not remove lev. There is no practical way to separate them without a good lab at your disposal. The physical characteristics: melting point, solubility, etc. are too similar. That&#039;s why it&#039;s such an effective cutting agent. It even looks scaly like good coke. <br /><br />

				Where is it coming from? According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, levamisole has become increasingly popular as a &quot;cut,&quot; or diluting agent, in cocaine and possibly some heroin. It is now found in 70% of all cocaine seized in the U.S., up from 30% in 2008. Unlike most cuts — usually inert or relatively harmless substances like the B vitamin inositol, which are added by lower-level dealers looking to stretch supplies — levamisole appears to be added to cocaine from the outset, in the countries of origin. The substance has been found in various concentrations in cocaine analyzed in countries around the world, from Switzerland to Australia. And urine tests of cocaine users attending a drug clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in 2009 — one floor above Graf&#039;s office — found that 90% of samples were positive for levamisole; similar tests in Seattle revealed that 80% of cocaine users there had levamisole in their systems.<br /><br />&quot;If it&#039;s showing up in all those different places, that&#039;s a prima facie indicator that it&#039;s happening at the highest levels of production,&quot; says Craig Reinarman, a sociologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who has long studied cocaine. But since cocaine is illegal, there&#039;s no easy way to remove levamisole from the supply chain. Law enforcement could instead target large purchasers, possibly putting pressure on dealers to switch to other cuts. <br /><br />AND THIS

				AND ONE MORE THING--EFFECTS<br /><br />It was a medical mystery. In the summer of 2008, a man and woman, both in their 20s and both cocaine users, were separately admitted to a Canadian hospital with unremitting fevers, flulike symptoms and dangerously low white-blood-cell counts. Their symptoms were consistent with a life-threatening immune-system disorder called agranulocytosis, which kills 7% to 10% of patients and is rare except in chemotherapy patients and those taking certain antipsychotic medications.<br /><br />Neither of the Canadian patients fit that bill, but they did have one thing in common: illegal drug use, says Dr. Nancy Zhu, who treated the patients during her hematology fellowship at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton. &quot;We were theorizing that maybe it was something in the cocaine,&quot; she says.<br />(See how cocaine scrambles genes in the brain.)<br /><br />The medical literature didn&#039;t contain any studies linking agranulocytosis with cocaine. However, in April of that same year, a New Mexico lab had identified a small number of unexplained cases of the disorder, also in people who had snorted, injected or smoked cocaine. Later, in 2009, a few cocaine addicts in San Francisco — crack smokers, mostly — began displaying even stranger symptoms, like dead, darkened skin. &quot;It looked like people were getting burns all over their body,&quot; says Dr. Jonathan Graf, a rheumatologist at the University of California, San Francisco. &quot;[Their skin was] black, as if you had taken a cigarette butt to it. In some people, it was all over, on their legs and bellies.&quot;<br /><br />By that time, back in Canada, a toxicologist at Alberta Hospital had noticed an unusual chemical in the urine of the two cocaine-using patients: levamisole. Zhu contacted him, and they put the puzzle together. Further research revealed that levamisole, a drug that was once used to treat colon cancer but is now reserved for veterinary use as a medication to get rid of worms, can cause agranulocytosis in humans. The &quot;burns&quot; seen on Californian patients, who also were suffering from agranulocytosis, were the result of skin infections related to patients&#039; compromised immunity. There have now been several dozen cases of cocaine-related agranulocytosis reported in North America — and one known death. &quot;For some reason, this drug called levamisole keeps popping up,&quot; Zhu says. <br />

				thanx marcoraus&nbsp; great reply, thanks SO much for providing such a succint explanation as to why levamisole is used.&nbsp; Very cool +1<br /><br />It seems that this compound is being added to the drug waaay before vendors like 10toes get a chance to do anything...it seems this stuff is here to stay as for as the cartels are concerned<br /><br />what a shit that is!&nbsp; That said, we have had some great coke recently, which we can only compare to stuff we&#039;ve had waaay back when, and it was very good, maybe not &#039;stronger&#039; but definitely &#039;nicer&#039; than a lot of &#039;good&#039; coke we have had. hmmm?<br /><br />When did using this stuff as a cut first come onto the scene?&nbsp; &nbsp;hey marco has just posted a lot more info on this,&nbsp; Thanks very much bro, good to have members like you about ;)<br /><br /><br />cheers all m m m motek x

				This has bothered me for some time, though I only partake of the caine occasionally. I still don&#039;t want one grain of another substance in there that isn&#039;t at least benign, like mannitol, or inositol, or caffeine, as is common.<br /><br />I brought it up once on the Coke Vendors page under another pseudonym, and I was surprised at the amount of ambivalence, and ignorance of some of the regulars on there. It was as though many didn&#039;t want to hear any negative information about their favorite escape from reality. <br /><br />I can relate to that. Having been addicted to it in my younger years (20s). One kind soul pointed me in the direction of a few Vendors who clearly state in their ads or profiles &quot;Levamisole-free&quot;, some even claim to constantly test product as they get it in. There I made my choice for the purchase I needed for a friends birthday. It was a few more $ than I&#039;d planned on spending, but it got rave reviews from the small circle of friends, who hadn&#039;t had good coke or any for some, in many years. <br /><br />One &#039;expert&#039; said it was as close to the pure he tried once. Apparently he once managed to procure a bottle of Mercke Pharmaceutical from someone in the entertainment biz. (makes for a good story at parties anyway ;))<br /><br />So there are conscientious dealers/Vendors are out there, you just have to find them. You can also try PM&#039;g them, and ask if they know or test for it. <br /><br />Like others have said, and I&#039;ve read as well, most if not all of it, comes from the source, or is subsequently stepped on by the 2nd one in line, and most Coke Vendors are just reselling what they bought from some dealer, most likely 12 or 13 contacts away from the actual Cartel from whence it came. <br /><br />The ones who offer it Levamisole free, will be the last ones standing.&nbsp;

				As I mentioned before, I contacted a very Professional vendor about this situation. He stated that at this time most mid level distributors,including himself, don&#039;t have access to&nbsp; the proper testing kits to be able to quantitatively distinguish if this substance is in their product, it is only available to LE,crime labs and forensic units around the world.&nbsp; He did say that he is working on obtaining it through his contact. Some where around the 2nd week of June it should be in place for him. <br />So here I sit with 1.5gms of some&nbsp; really smooth product ,second guessing... :-\. The one good thing for me,is that I don&#039;t binge. 2lines and I&#039;m good for hours.

				&nbsp;It seems strange to say this, but from what we&#039;ve experienced cutting coke (well) is a much more &#039;difficult&#039; task than cutting heroin.<br /><br />&nbsp; Only becoz back in the days during our &#039;coke phase&#039;! (lol! some &#039;phase&#039;!) most buyers, even gm buyers would bust out a test tube full of bleach, chop up 20-30mgs and test the stuff (in the US the called it &quot;chlorox testing&quot;) and anything that wasn&#039;t coke showed up fairly clearly.&nbsp; most people made their own freebase using bicarb, any &#039;active&#039; cuts fucked up the process so dealer needed to keep it neutral.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Down here at the time, Ascorbic acid aka vitamin &#039;c&#039; was used as it fitted this purpose perfectly, it&#039;s very dense, (mildly acidic, doesn&#039;t affect &#039;basing&#039;) ... a rounded tablespoon weighed over 3gms (a heaped tblsp of this coke maybe weighed 1.5g&#039;s, it was very &#039;light and fluffy&#039;) so putting 3g&#039;s into an ounce seemed to change nothing, NO one could tell which was the cut and which wasn&#039;t, even the seasoned base cookers who thought they could easily know, from the cooking and the way it burnt and tasted! IDK I wasn&#039;t a smoker! I liked the rush too much. That train rush of silence and the ringing in the ears! Yo!&nbsp; (maybe when mixing it in a spoon you would notice a few crystals of ascorbic acid, but very little, and the rocks of coke needed to be massaged to dissolve and this would be gone at the same time, it was hard to tell)<br /><br />&nbsp;Back then all the &#039;known cuts&#039;&nbsp; had certain &#039;behaviour&#039; when dropped in bleach, but you couldn&#039;t really tell exactly what it was, although you would get an idea &#039;how much&#039; was there from watching &#039;how much did what?&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s actually a very good way to test coke but I haven&#039;t seen it used in decades!&nbsp; dunno why ...<br /><br />&nbsp; Seems like folks are happy to do a simple qualitative assay and then wait for someone else to tell them they had it tested with a GC/MS! One extreme to the other, whilst bleach testing is probably more effective than any other simple test for any other drug!&nbsp; Or maybe folks just dont know about it ... anyone?<br /><br />Back to smack, usually cuts cant/dont affect the stone so the choices are much greater ... and they dont use things like levamisole becoz they dont &#039;have to&#039;&nbsp; there are much cheaper alternatives and often this &#039;cutting&#039;&nbsp; are already done higher the food chain, far from street level, at least here in oz. And the &#039;cuts&#039; they do use are inert, usually some type of sucrose made bitter with quinine or the like..<br /><br />&nbsp; Re-rockin dope has been the case with all the street heroin I&#039;ve seen in melb the past few years, whereas sydneys dope still seems to be predominately powder ... on the brighter side, one of the few &#039;advantages&#039; to the dope being &#039;re-rocked&#039; before it hits the street levels, where trying to cut it would be futile ... IMO it&#039;s weird how melb and syd have diffrent ideas on what constitutes &#039;ok dope&#039; with sydney happy to see good powder whereas it seems melb has this obsession with dope having to be &#039;rocks&#039; ... it&#039;s dumb! <br /><br />mmmmm motek :o<br />&nbsp;

				I am an infrequent cocaine user, really just the odd line now and again, and the reason was that a good few years ago I had some really excellent cocaine and since then mostly shit!<br /><br />Back then I had a mate who dealt a bit and had some good contacts, one day he asked if I could analyse a sample of his gear (I worked in a lab at the time and had&nbsp; good GC/MS) so I sneaked in a tiny sample and ran it up one evening, result showed it to be almost pure (was converted to freebase for the analysis) there were traces of various bits n bobs but nothing that could be thought of as a cut, probably contaminants from the lab that extracted it.<br /><br />In return for my efforts I got a gram of the best charlie I ever had, pity he ended up 400 miles away and out of the business&nbsp; :( <br /><br />About a year after this I had&nbsp; a guy offer me some &quot;top grade&quot; &quot;pure&quot; coke and I bought a bit.&nbsp; Was dissapointed and ran an analysis on it and as expected it was only 29% cocaine the rest was made up of paracetamol, caffeine, speed and a few unknowns that were not on the machines database!<br /><br />Sadly I no longer work in a lab so I have no facilities to test, and generally dont buy coke and with the increasing use of levamisole I am less tempted than ever.<br /><br />Despite all the claims of vendors coke remains the one drug (I dont do heroin) that I dont trust on the road....and that not knocking the vendors its just I cant imagine finding any pure coke these days as everyone has said its cut way up the line so its a loosing battle to get clean coke.<br /><br />I just wish someone found a way of making proper coke synthetically...possible I believe but not easy.<br />

				unfortunately acetone wont work for levamisole BUT ethanol will!!<br /><br />&quot;Levamisole hydrochloride is only slightly soluble in absolute ethanol. So if you want to use cocaine I suggest you learn a few chemical processing techniques. Cocaine Hydrochloride is freely soluble in ethanol. Simply adding a small amount of ethanol to your sample will dissolve all the cocaine leaving levamisole behind. Filter off the levamisole and then evaporate off the alcohol from the cocaine solution and you will have mostly pure cocaine except for other cuts that may be soluble in ethanol.&quot;<br /><br />voila ... levamisole free cola!<br /><br /><br />m m m motek

				he says that ethanol wont work as it has too much water in it.&nbsp; IHDK?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;You can &quot;dry&quot; ethanol using magnesium salts, (Mg sulfate) you &#039;dry&#039; them in an oven at about 150c for 90mins, then crush it and put it into the ethanol ... voila, &#039;dry&#039; ethanol.<br /><br />You could maybe use di-ethyl ether (engine starter spray) but it has some characteristics (very volatile, not very easy to obtain for the uninitiated)&nbsp; which make using ethanol (methylated spirits in Oz) more viable.<br /><br /><br />Has anyone experience or know about what the effects of levamisole are in smaller doses?&nbsp; Does it have any effects?<br /><br />cutting coke with active cuts is ... is,&nbsp; just ... well<br /><br />it&#039;s such a shitty thing to do!<br /><br /><br />How many of you actually DO wash their coke, or turn it to the freebase?<br /><br /><br />hmmmmm motek :)

				Anyone have the latest statistics on levamisole content in cola in the US and/or worldwide? Many of the articles etc I have read on the clear net is posting data up to 2009. Any data out for 2012-2013? Have the makers, cartels etc realized the dangers and decreased use? I saw this flyer posted in a forum about levamisole as a cutting agent: http://a.imageshack.us/img291/5963/alerty.jpg (clear net). This was a flyer posted publicly in Seattle. Anyone with connects pass it on. Send this flyer to the makers of our product. Damn what a fkn buzz kill to worry if this shit is in my yay. All orders I place from now on will be accomponied with a combo EZ test. Testing for coke content and cutting agents. A box of 10 of these ests is only ~$25. Not bad, if we can afford $100-190 per gram I think we can afford a box of these tests. Get the word back to our dealers and get this shit out of our supply. EZtest.com on clear net supplies the tests. http://www.eztestkits.com/en/

Informed customers don&#039;t need to be fooled with stepped on shit, that tactic is for street dealing where there is no trust.<br /><br />There are suppliers out there that cater to high end buyers who provide the straight dope, that would be the ideal source for the road.<br />

				so I started at the back or end of the Cocaine listings and started with a new vendor,&quot;WhiteDreams, and politely sent him this message:<br /><br />&quot;Hello ,<br />Just wondering since you&#039;re so close to the source, do you know if your bricks are being cut with Levamisole. Are you testing for it? Its a pretty nasty cut in terms of side effects over the long haul. Thanks in advance<br />MarcoRuas&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;ll post the reply if I get one. BTW, I personally don&#039;t want to become a chemist to infrequently sniff a few lines of BLO. I just don&#039;t have the time.<br />WHITEDREAMS has replied:<br />&quot;They havent been in the past however i currently to not have a lab test. Its been probably 6 months since we got a lab test on the product. If u want try a small order for a sample?&quot;<br /><br />And I replied:&quot;The problem is I&#039;m not set up to test for that cut either. I&#039;m sure your product is very good. The thing is, levamisole, doesn&#039;t take away from the effects of the cocaine. If anything, it somewhat enhances it,but at a price. What&#039;s happening now is that as consumers, we are becoming more aware(or paying closer attention to) of the adulterants used in cocaine. Why the people at the top of the food chain would want to add this poison is beyond me and a lot of other people here on SR. Oh wait...GREED!! &quot;Google&quot; it and you&#039;ll understand why some if not most of us are up in arms.<br />Bottom line, if you could provide Levamisole free cocaine,and prove it, I think with out a doubt your sales will be even better.

				Marco - I have no idea about that vendor, but as a reasonably new vendor (1 month here) I do know both the source and content I sell.<br /><br />I regularly test and allow the community here to conduct any tests on my samples they wish - some review others don&#039;t (which I think a little rude to be honest as I am giving away product for the purpose of reviews/feedback and to ensure the community recognise those of us who are professional and respectful of you all)<br /><br />Anyway, I would welcome you all and perhaps give you a more joyful and complete experience!<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc

				using greys shake/bake method to remove levamisole should work<br /><br />do a acetone wash<br />heat a nonstick pan to 170f bake for 10min and sift like panning for gold.&nbsp; levamisole is a finer powder while cocaine clumps together, pull the clumps out repeat a few times<br /><br />

				I think we can all agree that Levamisole is a nasty cut, but as a few have already pointed out, it is not the vendor who mix in the Leva, it is the cartels, so there is really no reason to go on such a temper tantrum!<br /><br />Hmm, just skimmed the thread, so i&#039;m sorry if this have been pointed out already, but i am quite curious as to why OP changed the values in the lab results.<br /><br />In the lab thread PineAppleLove have posted this result:<br /><br />Published on: April 26 2013<br />Tested by: PineappleLove<br />Vendor: 10toes<br />Listed as: &quot;Premium Fishscale Cocaine&quot;<br />Purchasing method: Anonymous<br />Results:<br />58% Cocaine<br />20% Levamisole<br />6% Caffeine<br />(Source: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0)<br /><br /><br />But OP states the result as being:<br /><br />Published on: April 26 2013<br />Tested by: PineappleLove<br />Vendor: 10toes<br />Listed as: &quot;Premium Fishscale Cocaine&quot;<br />Purchasing method: Anonymous<br />Results:<br />48% Cocaine<br />46% Levamisole<br />6% Caffeine<br /><br /><br />Looks like a gross exaggeration, by OP, but i cant figure out if he is doing this to discredit the vendor more than usually, or if it is because he figures he will get more responses with his own made up numbers&nbsp; :o <br /><br />Any thought on this?<br /><br />For those seeking to clean up their coke, you can find some techniques here: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/317605-cocaine-purification-the-absolute-final-thread<br /><br />I havent tried all the techniques, but usually i do one or two acetone washes, and perhaps an ethanol wash.<br /><br />Regarding Magnesium sulphate to dry the Ethanol; Motek is probably right in saying that 90 minutes in the oven is good enough (He seems to be extremely knowledgeable), but usually i let them sit in the oven between 120-150 minutes. This might not be necessary but that is just the way i have always done it...

If you don&#039;t know what is in the substance you are selling then you have no business selling it. If it is stepped on you had better damn well point that out in the listing<br /><br />Buyers deserve to know what they are getting.<br /><br />I have noticed this sort of complacancy in the coke community in the past and the fact that people put up with it is why it keeps getting stepped on.<br /><br />I am sure most people would rather pay the same price and get just the 40% coke without the additives. Informed customers don&#039;t need to be fooled with stepped on shit, that tactic is for street dealing where there is no trust.<br /><br />There are suppliers out there that cater to high end buyers who provide the straight dope, that would be the ideal source for the road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Great Post.. I agree 100% vendors need to be more honest about what their selling. Blaming shitty quality product on a bad batch and similar excuses is total crap.

				Bumping because it&#039;s a great thread!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about 10Toes. From looking at his page, it seems he&#039;s more the victim of a few whiny competitors, or buyers who either <br /><br />(a) Can&#039;t accept the fact that their order might have been intercepted. <br />or<br />(b) Are just dumb.<br /><br />Though the back and forth between everyone made the last hour of my at home detox, that much more bearable.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />soalone<br /><br /><br />

				Had to post this info I found on the uses, contraindications and potential adverse reactions of Levamisole.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s a clearnet link to the page where I found this: http://www.mims.com/USA/drug/info/levamisole/?type=full&amp;mtype=generic.&nbsp; My own brief analysis appears below the quote.<br /><br />&quot;levamisole<br />&gt; Indication &amp; Dosage<br />&gt; Administration<br />&gt; Contraindications<br />&gt; Special Precautions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; Adverse Drug Reactions<br />&gt; Drug Interactions<br />&gt; Pregnancy Category (US FDA)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; Mechanism of Action<br />&gt; MIMS Class<br />&gt; ATC Classification<br /><br />Related Information<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />See related levamisole information Abbreviation Index<br />Indication &amp; Dosage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral<br />Ascariasis<br />Adult: 150 mg as a single dose.<br />Child: 3 mg/kg as a single dose.<br />Oral<br />Mixed ascariasis-hookworm infections<br />Adult: 2.5 mg/kg as a single dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.<br />Child: 2.5 mg/kg as a single dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.<br />Oral<br />Ancylostomiasis<br />Adult: 2.5 mg/kg as a single dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.<br />Child: 2.5 mg/kg as a single dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.<br />Administration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be taken with food.

Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.<br />Mechanism of Action &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levamisole is the active laevo-isomer of tetramisole. It works by paralysing susceptible intestinal worms which are then excreted from the intestines. Levamisole also enhances cellular immune responses in humans.<br />Absorption: Well-absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1.5-2 hr.<br />Metabolism: Occurs extensively in the liver.<br />Excretion: Mainly in the urine (70% as metabolites and 5% as unchanged drug) and small amounts in the faeces.<br />MIMS Class &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthelmintics / Cytotoxic Chemotherapy<br />ATC Classification &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P02CE01 - levamisole ; Belongs to the class of imidazothiazole derivative agents. Used as antinematodal.&quot;<br /><br />What I found most interesting is that Levimasole combined with alcohol causes a disulfiram-like reaction.&nbsp; Disulfiram&#039;s commercial name is Antabuse, and it brings on an acute and unpleasant sensitivity to alcohol.&nbsp; So please be careful when combining coke and booze!!&nbsp; And here&#039;s where it get&#039;s even more interesting:&nbsp; &quot;Disulfiram is also being studied as a treatment for cocaine dependence, as it prevents the breakdown of dopamine (a neurotransmitter whose release is stimulated by cocaine); the excess dopamine results in increased anxiety, higher blood pressure, restlessness and other unpleasant symptoms.&quot;&nbsp; If this is true, there is a delicious irony here, since it would mean cocaine manufacturers are undermining the very source of their profits, i.e., their customer&#039;s dependence on cocaine!&nbsp; Defeated by their own greed.&nbsp; And so it seems that the upsurge in Levimasole-laced cocaine is at least partially responsible for many of the negative symptoms cocaine users have been reporting since the end of the golden age of the 1980&#039;s.<br /><br />Some may be thinking, hey wait a minute, more dopamine should mean more pleasure from the drug, right?&nbsp; Well, maybe, but my guess is that good, clean coke prompts the release of dopamine which is then appropriately broken down in the brain.&nbsp; It is the proper balance of dopamine with other neurotransmitters that provide the euphoria that cocaine produces.&nbsp; Simply flooding the brain with dopamine without properly breaking it down would be like stuffing yourself with way too much food, with no time to digest.&nbsp; In the case of overeating you get an upset stomach and indigestion.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the case of Levimasole preventing breakdown of dopamine, you get a haywire nervous system.&nbsp; Both suck.

				If in fact there was that much cut in the coke, then yeah, thats just wrong at every level. If it were me, I would attempt polite communication with vendor, if unsatisfactory result, then fuck it, don&#039;t deal with them ever again.

				I read that Most of the worlds cocain is now contaminated, i think by this levimisole, the article said it was a livestock dewormer.&nbsp; The article said that cows are made to graze and live in the areas where they grow the coca between crops, theyre manure giving nutrents to the next run of coca.&nbsp; So potentially it is in the coca plant.&nbsp; I believe i read that im time magazine.<br /><br />sry if that has allready been mentioned i didnt read 6 pages<br /><br />+1 motek

				I&#039;d be interested to see how you first approached the vendor. <br />If it was at all like the OP you just made, I don&#039;t blame her/him for the reaction that you got. <br /><br />
