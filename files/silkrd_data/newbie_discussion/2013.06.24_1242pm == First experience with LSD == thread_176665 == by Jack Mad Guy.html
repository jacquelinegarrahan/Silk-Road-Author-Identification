				I&#039;m finally getting around to experimenting with LSD. I&#039;ve ordered 3 blotters from The Flying Dutchman and hopefully they&#039;ll arrive soon enough.<br /><br />So I&#039;m planning to do it with two other friends, although one might not actually take a blotter (could be the sitter). I&#039;ve two questions in mind:<br /><br />- Will I have enough time if I stay for a whole night (evening + night + morning) at my buddy&#039;s place, to trip comfortably?<br />- Any tips as to how I could enhance my first trip? And how to let myself be taken by the trip, rather than to brake up and try to control it.<br /><br />Edit: It&#039;s also my first time with psychedelics.

				You might need a longer time. For first timers, try relaxing music or psychedelic movies (Fantasia for example).<br />If you have music or movies to guide your mind, you will just experience it and go with the flow. If you trip without music,<br />your mind will automatically create something to amuse you. Some people like going inside of their heads, some people don&#039;t.<br />The key is not to control your mind, but to distract your mind when you think of something bad, and if you have mastered this, you will always have great trips!

				Depending on how strong the tab is and your body composition, you&#039;re looking at tripping for ~10-12 hours maybe less. Erowid is always a great source of information on psychoactives. Here&#039;s the link for LSD effects: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_effects.shtml<br /><br />I&#039;m a fairly new user as well; only tripped twice before. I&#039;m a kind of a heavy dude, and my first time I took 2 tabs, approximately 150µg each, 300µg total and I had plenty of fun. At one point I went for a walk around the neighborhood at dusk, and it was probably one of the most memorable experiences in my life. That&#039;s a good idea to combat a bad trip if you feel one coming on.<br /><br />Another tip from one inexperienced user&nbsp; to another: The come up is a lot slower than you might think. You&#039;ll feel it in your extremities first, then you&#039;ll start feeling kinda rosey cheeked like you&#039;ve just had a beer. And then after about 20 - 30 minutes total, you&#039;ll know what&#039;s up. When I popped my first one, I was expecting to have to wait for a half hour and then instantly jump up to cloud nine. It&#039;s a long lasting drug, so just give it some time.<br /><br />ALSO, some people recommend you take 2 hits your first time (hence why I did). This guys talks about just that, and as an added bonus he tells some pretty good stories: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hg1KkeaV1s<br /><br />Let us know how your trip goes!

				They call it tripping because when it&#039;s over you will remember it like a vacation trip..regardless of what you do! Music is great, movies are great. Any situation where you can control the environment...i.e lighting, temperature and number of people around you is good. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it is a lot of fun to trip at a festival but your first time should be about the experience of LSD. It will unlock parts of your brain you didn&#039;t know existed. Long after the trip is over you will see things differently and in a good way. A positive attitude long before you take it is important. You want to be in a good state of mind. After you take it, just relax and don&#039;t expect anything and you will enjoy everything.

				you&#039;ll have fun... some of the most fun i&#039;ve ever had partying was when on lsd/shrooms... great fun just make sure you are around good people and (i would suggest) staying inside, or at least on your own property, i would not suggest driving, or going to public places just in case you cant handle it, getting arrested while tripping balls is not a fun time...&nbsp; heheh

When tripping, your mind works faster than usual, you are able to see how quick your mind is changing direction, and you can tell your mood is lifting up too. Your mind is so open for suggestion, it believes whatever you tell it.

				Wow! Thanks for all your feedback - didn&#039;t expect so many replies ;)<br /><br />Not thinking about a bad trip&#039;s not a problem - I&#039;m not (too? :p) worried anyway. I&#039;m mostly looking forward to discover my inner self and see if it has any answers to give - direct or not - to some questions that are bugging my mind.<br /><br />Some seem to say that getting prepared/excited (in a positive way) for the experience helps with the trip. Is that true?<br /><br />Edit: Should I eat or not before tripping? Or is it better to have an empty belly (couple of hours or so) before ingesting?

One of my best trips was with two friends in Colorado. We hiked straight up the side of a 12,000ft mountain...made it up to timberline, so like 11,200ft, and then went running full on through the forest toward a lake we&#039;d seen out on the horizon. I&#039;ve never felt more like an animal in my life...just a living, sensing, running machine without a care in the world outside of not running into a tree, and finding that lake. And we found it...just popped out of the treeline, and there it was. Then we beelined over two moraines with marshy creeks and beaver ponds between them, to find ourselves 200 yards down the road from where I&#039;d parked. No maps or anything. We later figured out we&#039;d covered a good 20 miles in six hours or so, never once walking on a trail. That was a beautiful day.<br /><br />I say just go where it takes you...within reason, of course. Don&#039;t decide to see if you can drive the car with your mind, and if you want to fly, don&#039;t jump off of anything. Just close your eyes and picture it. :) Have fun!
