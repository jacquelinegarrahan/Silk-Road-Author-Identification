				I&#039;m thinking of making a separate account to sell as a vendor but how do you gain the trust of buyers etc? Or is it best to just offer products at the lowest price possible to get a better rep up and then adjust them accordingly?<br /><br />I&#039;d only be domestic also so I&#039;m not sure if that changes anything. Thanks! :D

				Thanks for the replies! How do PGP keys work? I&#039;ve noticed some buyers have them and some don&#039;t use them anymore. <br /><br />Right now I have my own store on eBay and I sell things on a daily basis so everything is sent out within 24 hours of a buyer paying for their order, same would apply with SR so I&#039;m not new to online retail in that sense however I am new to SR. That being said if a buyer buys something off of me and they never receive it, they could always dispute the payment anyway right? So new or not, if they didn&#039;t have their product they&#039;d be covered.<br /><br />That being said all my packages would be sent with tracking (as I do with ebay) so that all parties can see when a product is delivered and to avoid scammers - even ebay has plenty of those.

				I believe the smiley face dude was spamming to get to 50 posts and was rude about his chosen threads for his spam, imo.<br /><br />As for encryption, read up on it a bit and use the PGP club stickied at the top of the forum for practice and to see any questions you are likely to have answered. You will need it for people to feel safer sending you their addresses if you are a vendor.<br /><br />Thanks to &quot;Dont Ask ME&quot; for mentioning my SR presence fondly :-)

Going that rout, however, is bad for buyer and seller reputations. Some may try to take advantage of buyers and especially new vendors who care about their reputation.<br /><br />Checking tracking can flag a package, especially if done from Tor (rumor). If the package is intercepted and you track it from your own computer, I believe there can be concerns there as well. So tracking good, giving out and using tracking both deserve some further stealth thinking.

				Thanks for the info :D I haven&#039;t heard of packages being intercepted here like that unless its huge quantities - last I think was guns, drugs AND money - so I&#039;ll just say I wouldn&#039;t be involved in such actions. But if it were tracking via the postal company through Tor wouldn&#039;t you still remain anonymous? (Domestic post I mean). That being said I have also seen a lot of legit things being sold on SR also.

				Study the security threads on the forum boards. <br /><br />STUDY THEM. <br /><br />Not like you study for a high school exam. Not like the dollar menu at lunch. Not like a text from your mother... <br /><br />STUDY THE SECURITY BOARDS like the third time you are studying the driver&#039;s license exam booklet after failing the test twice. Like you study the meaning of the lines on an at home pregnancy test. Like you study that new bump that appeared on your privates after a weekend in South Beach Miami.<br /><br />You feel me newb?<br /><br />Then price well, respond fast, be super nice, and ship the same day as ordered. You&#039;ll do fine.<br /><br />What are you selling, champ?<br /><br />Modzi
