				Title: <strong>Finalization Inquiry</strong><br />

				Hello all. I&#039;m having some concerns about the process of payment to vendors. It is my understanding that, you place an order and your bitcoins are transferred to escrow. During this time the vendor is supposed to package and ship your order. During this waiting period, the delivery period, you DO NOT pay the vendor, or &quot;FE.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how you go about finalizing payment to vendors once a package is received via mail service. Could someone guide me through this process. I don&#039;t mean to sound dense, and I&#039;m sure that this process is relatively easy, but this is my first transaction and I would like to not receive negative feedback based solely on misunderstanding. <br /><br />Also, is there a period of time that your coins stay in escrow before the order &quot;Auto Finalizes?&quot; If so, how do I prevent this, in case of delayed shipping, hold ups, etc. <br /><br />Thank you all in advance. Best regards.

				When the vendor marks an order &#039;In transit&#039;, you will notice a link on the page that says &#039;finalize&#039; beside that order. When your order gets to you and you are happy that it is what you paid for, click finalize and the payment will be sent to the vendor. You will then also have the opportunity to leave feedback for your shopping experience with that vendor.<br /><br />You will also notice a link beside the &#039;finalize&#039; one. This one is called &#039;resolve&#039;. If your item doesn&#039;t arrive, click &#039;resolve&#039; and you will be brought through a process called the Resolution Center. Here, you will try and come to a satisfactory resolution for both you and the seller, for the missing item.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				As stated, there are 17 days before the payment held in escrow is released.<br /><br />The resolve button allows you to either give the vendor more time foe the order to arrive (essential with some vendors in distant nations to yours) so you can give 7 more days and then give another 7 and so on. <br /><br />You can also ask for a refund of a % of the cost or for a resend.<br /><br />The resolution cenre is very well organized. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only had to use it when ordering from some far away nation. Some vendors have shipping times of 21 days or more so you will need to give them more than the 17 days. I would always leave it until a couple of days before finalize if its a domestic orders. But do promise to pay IF the package arrives. I&#039;ve had one record of over 40 days. Even got the reship before the original which was sent on the day the vendor stated. Sometimes, very rarely, the post can have issues. <br /><br />Thanks to the SR resolution staff who do a great job IMO.

				If&nbsp; a buyer is unhappy with the product shipped, whether due to weight, quality, etc.&nbsp; what is the procedure?&nbsp; Does the buyer go to resolve initially, or message the seller first?

				Thanks all for the advice. I needed some clarification. <br /><br />Will the road let me know if my package is about to auto finalize due to the 17 day limit?
