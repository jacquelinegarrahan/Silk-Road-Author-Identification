				Hello,<br /><br />Is it save to buy some ecstasy from a Netherlands seller? I live in Germany.<br /><br />I fear that the package gets opened. - I know that the police is controlling/searching for drugs at the Netherlands/Germany border, because of the legality of weed in the Netherlands. Is it likely? Have you heard of such cases?

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested in this as well. I talked to one dutch vendor about this and he told me that sending pills from the Netherlands to Germany is more difficult than even to the USA. He told me that with good stealth, about 10% of all shipments gets intercepted by German customs (small orders as well as bulk).<br /><br />I made a small order to a save shipping address nevertheless, and it got through without problems. Stealth was very good but there was still room for improvement. Anyways, I think 10% is too high to order frequently or in large quantities.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious whether the success rate can be significantly increased if stealth is taken to an extreme level as described in various threads (i.e. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=119458.0 ) and somehow maybe even beyond that.<br /><br />Another issue is how German LE and customs tend to react once a package has been intercepted. What (quantities or other factors?) triggers a love letter, a controlled delivery and / or even a search warrant?<br /><br />Maybe an established&nbsp; vendor or an experienced buyer could comment on this without revealing stealth methods.<br /><br />In regards of the recent arrests in Germany ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182012.0 ), we should all realize that security is the most important issue for everyone (!) and that we should try to minimize risk when and where ever its possible.

				I have now talked about this with several other established dutch xtc vendors and almost all of the assured me that sending pills from Holland to Germany is no problem at all and that as good as every shipment arrives without being intercepted if the stealth is good (small as well as bulk orders). I not really sure if that&#039;s true however...I guess I am going to give it a try using a very safe delivery address.

				Maybe there is someone with experience in this matter who would like to share?<br /><br />It would also be interesting to know how German Customs and LE tend to react once an order is intercepted. Do they simply seize the package or do they also follow through with search warrants and arrest (regarding orders below 100 pills)?<br /><br />Did that happen to someone ordering from the Netherlands?

				It depends highly on the package. I am from East Europe and always affraid to ship form NL. I always try to get the best vendor to get the best stealth, but it doesnt always work out. Haven`t lost a single package though.

				to Fred:<br /><br />do you really think it depends on the state that you live in? I mean, of course drug possession is punished and persecuted much more harshly in the south of Germany. However, if an order from the NL is intercepted it is handled by German customs first, right? Do they then always hand over the hole thing to the local police or do the custom officers decide weather to pursue the recipient or not?<br /><br />I think you can safely buy bulk from some of the bigger german xtc vendors but most of the pills from the famous nintendo press or the Mortal Kombat press (both dutch) are rarely available and if they are then the prices are just way too high for bulk. The same goes for the German presses whose quality I did not have the opportunity to test (also since bulk prices are very high).<br /><br />Furthermore, I dont know if the use of MBBs is enough to prevent interception but imo it should be standard for all international shipments from the NL.<br /><br /><br /><br />to utnubu:<br /><br />I agree that the best stealth is necessary in order to receive orders from the NL. I dont know how strict custom controls in eastern europe are compared to the german ones, however. Good to hear that you never lost a shipment. Aprox. how often did you order and what amounts , if you dont mind me asking?<br /><br /><br />Any other input on this topic is still much appreciated!

				I think it would be pretty save to order from SuperTrips or XTCEXPRESS, they both have lots of transactions as well as mostly positive feedback.<br />Which dutch vendor would you consider to be more trustworthy?<br /><br />I think there will always be a few negative feedbacks after so many transactions (its the same on ebay).<br /><br /><br />Anyways, this is kind of interesting: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=191371.0<br /><br />IMO the guy was pretty naive but it will be interesting how things turn out. Looks like he has to deal with customs directly instead of the police, well probably both. Dont know which EU country hes talking about but still...<br />

				to fred: yeah you might be right about ST but XTCXPRESS is all right I think...<br /><br />the topic I wanted to show you was deleted by the OP. It was from some guy who always ordered X from the NL and thought it would be no problem since he lived in the EU as well (didnt say which country). After a couple of successful deliveries he now got a letter from customs that his order was intercepted and that he is required to make a statement at the customs office. I was curious how this would turn out and wrote a pm to the guy but never heard about the final consequences.<br /><br />On the original topic: I think the chances of passing through customs without being intercepted is actually pretty high as long as the order is just a letter (not a package), MBBs are used, professional outside package (not handwritten or anything like that), real return adress is used, and that the receiving address is not flagged by LE or customs already.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is of course still possible that a shipment is intercepted even though all these measures were taken but the probability is just much lower.<br /><br />I hope that someone on the road with access to empty apartments and/or houses will someday offer a re-ship service (for a fee of course) or something...I will put a detail request for that in the appropriate section one of these days.<br /><br /><br />to nucky: German vendors that I can recommend are Nightmare &amp; Limitless Corp (inactive atm) for xtc, no clue about h

				SuperTrips is the German vender I would recommend. His feedback may not be perfect but his service is. He has his listings down right now but he will be back soon and my only complaint is I did not order as much as I should of.&nbsp; &nbsp;
