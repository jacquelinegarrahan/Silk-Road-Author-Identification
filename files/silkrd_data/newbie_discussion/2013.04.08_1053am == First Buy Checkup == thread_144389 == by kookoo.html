				hi,<br /><br />i thought it would be a good idea to do a final checkup before placing my first order.<br /><br />1. using Liberte Linux booted from USB to for all SR business.<br />2. got BTC with cash anonymously and put them through an ewallet/tumbler.<br />3. ordering from local vendors only. small quantities or weed and molly.<br />4. using a PO Box for all mail. not just drops.<br />

				I&#039;d say you&#039;re pretty solid. There&#039;s no such thing as 100% safety, you are taking a risk whether you like it or not. But you&#039;ve done a pretty good job.<br /><br />I decided against PO box because it was too hard to find one near me and I felt that I would be ordering from SR infrequently enough that it would be suspicious showing up every few months for a random suspicious package. The stealth works much better if its mixed in with your regular mail to your home (IMO). Also if its addressed to you where you live, it also is less suspicious to your mail carrier. The down side is you expose your identity to the vendor, but you would technically be doing the same if buying in person.<br /><br />I think small quantities is key. It&#039;s kind of pointless to start a cross-state federal investigation for what amounts to small personal quantities.<br /><br />Finally, restricting your use of SR and drugs is the best way to stay safe. The less exposure you get, the less likely you&#039;ll get caught in a law enforcement net. Also, always revise your techniques to protect yourself. Access SR from different locations and IPs. Dump logs. Wipe your system clean that you use to access SR every once in a while. Don&#039;t use the same wallet all the time. Make it so there is not a singular identity. Shit, it might even make sense to create new SR accounts every once in a while and start fresh. That means you might have to take a risk with a few FE&#039;s to build up trust again, but it might be worth it if you are worried about getting caught
