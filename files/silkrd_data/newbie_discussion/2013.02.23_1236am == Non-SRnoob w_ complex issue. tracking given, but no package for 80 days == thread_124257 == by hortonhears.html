				I paid, and received a tracking number shortly after paying. I continued to extend the expected shipping date by a week so several times, until one time it to my horror,&nbsp; autofinalized. Now the vendor is MIA.<br /><br />However! I do have this tracking number: *****************, but the strangest thing about it is that it reports that it left Germany, and now is in Colombia &quot;en processo.&quot; It has been like this for more than 80 days, and USPS still reports: &quot;We have received notice that the originating post is preparing to dispatch this mail piece. Information on this item has been restored from offline files and will be available online for 30 days from 02/14/2013. &quot; You can see this all at once at this link:<br /><br />http://www.trackitonline.ru/?tn=*****************<br /><br />I am being paranoid about giving the actual number away, and none of the onion image hosting sites I&#039;ve tried are working.<br /><br />My questions are the following: Could this be some sort of &quot;fake&quot; tracking number? Or is there a way I can call either USPS or the Colombian mail service to inquire about the package safely, i.e. without incriminating myself? <br /><br />I just about lost my life savings with that order.<br /><br />Regarding this order:<br /><br />status: finalized<br />seller: Dutchaanbod(98)<br />contract: Standard Escrow v1.0<br />item: 100 gr high grade MDMA 80% +<br />quantity: 1<br />payment usd: $1,486.97<br />shipping: Sending out from GERMANY<br /><br />ordered: November 19, 2012, 10:43 pm UTC<br />shipped: November 20, 2012, 2:43 pm UTC<br />finalized: December 7, 2012, 3:00 pm UTC<br /><br />Can anyone help me try to get this package where its going?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[<br />

				After waiting 85 days, and neither post office updating the status of the package&#039;s whereabouts, I think the time for faith may be passed, and I don&#039;t know how to proceed.

				Honestly, I would have given up two months ago on hoping it would show up. If it does, then it is a bonus but I think you should be expecting nothing,
