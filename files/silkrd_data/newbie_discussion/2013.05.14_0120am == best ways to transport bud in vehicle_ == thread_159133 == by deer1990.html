				Definitely in your trunk, but to control the smell I&#039;d use a thermos if it&#039;s a small enough amount to fit in one. <br /><br />Another common method is storing it in the middle of coffee grounds.

				Petrol tank, inside the engine, hidden compartments, tyres, inside the doors<br /><br />I think the most important part is concealing the scent, getting a &#039;normal&#039; looking driver and an equally inconspicuous car<br /><br />I once saw a program, where tens of thousands worth of stuff had been hidden in a car. It had been very well done, well concealed and was totally smell proof. It would have gotten through, but a drug dog picked up a scent of drugs from the car that had been put there from one of the guys putting his hands on the outside of the car after touching the drugs before/while they were being packed and not having washed his hands properly

				If you know someone that owns an auto shop, you can make magic happen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had friends do vac seal in trunk, under bed liner in truck and in the spare tire.&nbsp; Auto shop is the best though, if you know what I mean.

				It really depends on the car, some cars may have better concealable storage spots than other cars. Also, some cars may be more inconspicuous than other cars. Driving a newer or clean looking car might help you not get pulled over.<br /><br />If you have a pick up truck, drill a hole in the bed and bondo that shit up. If you do a real good job on the bondo, it could look like you never fucked with the car. <br /><br />

				One piece of advice I&#039;ve always adhered to is that if you are going to do something illegal, only do one thing at a time.<br /><br />If you are transporting lots of weed in your car, you better sure as hell make sure you license registration insurance is up to date and valid. Also, check all your lights and functionality of your car, also make sure its clean.<br /><br />Hide in plain sight, don&#039;t draw any unwanted attention to yourself. Then worry about the smell after you have those things covered.

				Vacuum seal your weed three times. Put it in a lockbox in a packed trunk. Develop a story as to where you&#039;re headed and collaborate it with the driver beforehand in case the officers separate the two of you if there is more than one occupant in the car. Have absolutely nothing else in the vehicle, or on your person. Don&#039;t consent to searches. Am I being detained or am I free to go? <br /><br />Even if they wanted to be pricks without probable cause they need a drug dog to alert before getting a warrant, which you&#039;ve taken care of with the sealer. Even if they get in the trunk they have to break open a locked container. <br /><br />

				A friend from highschool who is a state trooper told me a couple years ago to also not have anything hanging from your rear view mirror and he said they call those Tree air fresheners &quot;drug trees &quot; because the dummy&#039;s who smoke weed in their car think they are being smart and using them to cover the smell. Plus you can be pulled over for any obstructions of the windshield.

				Traveling at the speed limit, during the day, looking clean cut, in a newer, clean vehicle. Have a couple benji&#039;s in your wallet for a last ditch effort if you do get tagged.
