				I did some research for myself and fellow rookies on this PGP there is no need for panic, I came across a great site and you do not have to install anything on to your computer its all done on site it gives you your public and private PGP encrytion you just have to save it somewhere &quot;darknet usb drive would be best&quot; and the site is very good at walking you through everything step by step and even has practice option on there for you to try so you know your doing it correctly.&nbsp; Just go to igolder.com I promise its a cinch and it took me only a few minutes to figure everything out.&nbsp; Anybody needs help please feel free to message me with any questions and ill do my best to walk ya through it.&nbsp; Goodluck and stay safe people&#039;s..

				i&#039;m a very untrusting person and not sure i would trust such a site. do you know if they store messages that you encrypt thru them at all? ..they could all be sitting on a server somewhere for future inspection for all we know.

				Perhaps OP means well, but 1- i would never recommend using a website to encrpt/decrypt- it defeats the purpose, 2- GPG is learn able- plenty of tutorials here on the forum i use gpg4usb and it literally could not be more user friendly and 3- if you goto igolder its shutting down as of 1- aug-2013<br />

				I also am very untrustworthy it takes a lot to gain my loyalty so I feel ya there, I did a lot of research on the site and seen nothing bad that would alarm me in anyway.&nbsp; And they don&#039;t send the messages for you, you have to copy and then paste into what ever your using to send the message, nothing is saved and all you need to make an account is a password and email address so if you make one just use your tor email.&nbsp; Just another option out there for people with problems understanding how to use the PGP, check it out and decide for yourself.&nbsp; Also it&#039;s not shutting down completely just certain aspects of there business from what I read I could be wrong but just trying to help is all.

				Your def right verdant_world&nbsp; that program you listed just downloaded and its very navigational and easy to use thanx for the heads up, I def admit when I am wrong and it isnt prolly to safe to do encrypt and decrypt over a website like that, good thing we have these forums...

				I know this great site that can encrypt text to pgp without downloading anything. Also you can download the page, so you can have a simple offline page to encrypt whatever you want.<br />&nbsp;<br />jflycmc37lkdm7rz.onion - Cryptor<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day everyone! :)
