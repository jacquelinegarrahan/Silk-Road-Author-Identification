				Ok so I got my silver surfer, let it heat up for 5 min, throw some DMT...and just sitting...and sitting..and waiting....barely any type of smoke comes out...wtf.... <br /><br />&nbsp;I had it at about 75% of the way on. Does DMT just take extremely long to vape? <br /><br />Another 60mg thrown away today..sigh... this is extremely frustrating to me now...

				I mostly use a light bulb. Heat it up until the dmt melts. Put a empty pen in and suck. Fresh air enters the bulb and a lot of dmt smoke enters your body

				the only fool proved way is the sandwich method. go for it. everyone has problems with light blubs, vaporizers, etc... ive never read anybody ever had problems with the sandwich method. weed - dmt - weed (can also take tabbac - dmt - tabbac or whatever). suck the bong as slowly as possible while fire it, to not burn the dmt instantly and everything should work well. good ride to you

				I just searched to see what Silver Surfer is. Don&#039;t know if this could work.<br />The sandwich method is one way to do it but in my opinion I wouldn&#039;t mix dmt with weed since it will dim your trip.<br />Buying the Glass Vapor Genie is one solution but I find it extremely expensive. If you can afford it then go for it. It is the best method. But the easiest and cheapest way to do dmt is to make a &quot;machine&quot;. Google it .<br /><br />Or if you can&#039;t make it or don&#039;t have the tools then I would suggest you checking this preloaded machine form the vendor dmtnexus. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0312123409<br /><br />Take care my friend!<br /><br />Adamiz
