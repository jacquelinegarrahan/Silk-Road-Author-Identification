				I placed an order with schizofreen on Jan 15th, and it never showed. I did not receive a letter or anything from the post office or customs. Do you think there is a good chance my address is now flagged by the usps, or was this probably caught in the Netherlands?<br />Thanks

				Mail is not being scanned going out.<br />Not trying to freak you out, but after 25 days from Europe to the USA you can expect a letter from customs pretty soon or worse if it was illegal and big enough.

				I&#039;m not sure what to think. I have had another order come in about a week ago, but that was domestic. The order that didn&#039;t show was just a few grams of mdma. <br />The seller said that he didn&#039;t think customs were still sending the love letters, and I have another order that is on the way.

				Well it&#039;s official. I got my LL today. It says notice of removal and all that stuff. This was an order from the NL, so I guess not too surprising. I am now a bit worried, as I have two more coming. One more is from the EU, but not NL. Should I be worried that my address is now flagged and I shouldn&#039;t even order domestic any more?

				IT may be flagged it may not be. the only thing you can do is deny responsibility if any packages were intercepted. Don&#039;t sign for anything and just chalk up any packages you haven&#039;t received as a loss. Find a new drop and have your items sent there. Also there&#039;s a chance they never even sent your order in the first place. If you FE thats on you.

				Well he must have sent it, or I wouldn&#039;t have gotten a letter. I didn&#039;t FE, and in fact got a 75% refund the other day for it, as it had been about 3 weeks from ordering.

				Well, my other orders came through just fine. Neither order was even punched, so I doubt that my address is flagged or anything. I don&#039;t think I will be ordering from the NL again though, at least not to the same address. I think it just came down to poor stealth from a flagged country. Prior to this I had 2 orders from the NL come, both were punched but no problems.
