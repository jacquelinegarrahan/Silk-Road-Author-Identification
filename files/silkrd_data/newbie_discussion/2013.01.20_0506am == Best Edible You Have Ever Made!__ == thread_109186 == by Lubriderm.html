				I have made brownies twice.&nbsp; First batch was with vaped weed canna butter.&nbsp; Results were not impressive.&nbsp; Second batch was much better, bought several grams of kief from Rook (yes I am lazy) and used that for the butter.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall the ratios bulk the brownies were much more effective.

				I tend to find I&#039;ve made some really good edibles with vaped weed. What really seems to dial in potency with any bud you are cooking with&nbsp; is temperature and how long you actually let your butter or canna-ingredients cook/simmer before making any actual food. Even what some friends and I have considered the &quot;perfect&quot; recipes tend to make us unable to fuctional. Remember, decarboxylation is your friend.

				Yes to the vaped weed. Just made a batch of peanut butter cookies the other night.<br />I also made lollipops with a friend one time. They were...interesting.

				Made dark chocolate truffles with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose a few times. The bitterness of the chocolate covers up the taste of the seeds pretty well. Trippy chocolates, what&#039;s not to like?

				some great ideas in this thread. I&#039;ve made a batch of cookies, twice. Both times the majority of the cookies were eaten by my dumbass friend who thought he didnt feel anything, and then by my mother who thought I had made some fresh cookies(even though they were very hidden, she either has a smelling tooth for chocolate or likes to fuck with me)<br /><br />After those 2 experiences, it just wasnt worth the effort for me anymore...I&#039;ve bought some excellent cookies from D11 when his baker was around, and will probably try some more on the road

				Definitely a batch of shroom-tea. It was actually fucking delicious, we had to stop ourselves from chugging the whole thing. Unfortunately, we weren&#039;t too good in that, and ended up tripping fucking balls for ages.
