				I understand with the recent attacks on SR, logging on is going to be a bit more difficult, but I have been seeing some posts(usually from more experienced users)that have been able to get on even after the attack. I&#039;ve been attempting to logon with my usual username, pass, and now with the code I made during my initial registration. The issue is, once I enter all of this info, I get redirected back to the same login page, with the exact same verification code, and the same thing happens when I click the &quot;register&quot; link. Any tips or advice concerning logging on or just registering a new account is appreciated, thanks for your time.

				When you say &#039;code&#039;, do you mean PIN? SR logon will never ask you for the PIN...PIN is only used to buy items and withdraw BTC from account. Phishing sites will ask for your PIN.<br /><br />SR logon simply asks for username, password, and captcha to make sure you&#039;re human.

				Well that&#039;s unfortunate, thanks for all of the quick responses, sounds like I did get phished... Well, since my link should be avoided, any tips on where to get a secure link outside of the Directory? I do appreciate all the help

				Did you have any money in the account? If so, post the URL to the fake site you were trying to log in on. There are many bored people around here, and I&#039;m sure a few people (me included) won&#039;t mind spamming them with useless log-in credentials to sift through. <br /><br />Silk Road is completely down right now and may be offline for a few more days, so your best chance is to keep trying the proper URL (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion) and hope you can log in faster than the phisher can change your password.
