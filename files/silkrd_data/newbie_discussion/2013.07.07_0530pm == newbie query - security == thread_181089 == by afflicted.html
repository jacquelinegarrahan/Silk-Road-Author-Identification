				The VPN, if configured so that traffic goes through the VPN then to the tor entry node, helps obfuscate from your ISP and other snoopers that your IP address is accessing Tor.<br /><br />PGP in the SR context is normally used when placing an order to encrypt your name and address, so that only the vendor can access that information.<br /><br />Tails is an image that helps you to use Tor on pretty much any computer without leaving any trace later that Tor was used on it. Basically you put it on a USB stick or possibly DVD and boot from that.<br /><br />Kleopatra is for managing keys and doing PGP encryption, but it&#039;s not nearly as easy to use as something like GPG4USB.

				Thanks for your patience and prompt reply ,ok so I should ditch kleopatra and take a look at gpg4usb.&nbsp; &quot;IF&quot; i want to access tor on another pc, I need tails otherwise tails is not necessary, gpg4usb is compatible with Kleopatra I&#039;m guessing .........

				afflicted,<br /><br />I want to suggest to you that if you are not very savvy with computer network technology that you install tails and get a feel for it.&nbsp; It does come with a variety of software you may like - a pgp tool, IRC tool, and much more. You may find that you really like it, or at the least you may find some inspriation toward some other method of anon computing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a simple suggestion.

				There&#039;s a lot to cover when you first start out. There are so many great posts in the different sections to read. Definitely read posts in the security section.

				I agree with the man above. Make yourself a tails live usb and use that for all your tor needs. You won&#039;t look back.

GPG4USB is easier to use because it has a built in text editor and allows operations directly from the clipboard (copy/paste). Kleopatra wants to just work with files already saved on the computer.
