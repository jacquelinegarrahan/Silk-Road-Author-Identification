				Greetings, fellow travellers!<br /><br />I would like to take this opportunity to announce myself as a new vendor to the road. I hope to supply all of you lovely UK cannalovers with some tasty edibles, medibles and treats. I&#039;m talking THC made with TLC!<br /><br />To start with, I&#039;ll be offering up some beautiful hash chocolates. In time, I hope to produce other high flying delicacies to tickle your taste buds (and your brain!).<br /><br />I&#039;ll be using the finest top quality hash and concentrates imported from around the globe. Each edible will be dosed accurately, using precise scientific equipment to ensure the perfect decarb each and every time. This means maximum bang for your buck! But it&#039;s not just the hash that is top quality, all of my ingredients are! I will be using extra virgin, organic, unrefined coconut oil, organic cocoa butter and non-GM lecithin in all of my edibles to dramatically increase bio-availability. If you&#039;re a recreational user, expect to get WRECKED ;) I&#039;ll also be using top quality chocolate (organic where possible).<br /><br />This isn&#039;t your standard, undosed, 12+ hour burnt cannabutter made by an amateur. This is Sugarleaf quality. My techniques will ensure not only the perfect decarboxylation, but also that the majority of vital cannabinoids make it into the final product, essential to medicinal users. This means a nice balance of THC, CBD and CBN for a well rounded product that will leave you with a wonderful high and a nice body stone with no unwanted side effects.<br /><br />I also hope to offer edibles with higher levels of CBN and lower levels of THC for a more sedative, less psychoactive effect. These would be perfect for medicinal users or for those times when you just need to let your body rest, recuperate and sleep! Capsules are also a future possibility.<br /><br />The high quality materials and precise dosing ensures that there will be plenty of safe (and fun) medibles for all medical marijuana users. Being a medical user myself, I understand how important strain and dosing can be to allow you to function at your best. Enjoyable medicine is the best medicine :)<br /><br />I&#039;m a one person operation, importing, decarbing, cooking, packaging and posting all myself. Rest assured that your information will be in very safe hands and not passed on to lackeys to handle. I take security very seriously, yours and mine. I will be recommending that PGP is used with all orders and using the best stealth and packaging methods available.<br /><br /><br />And now for the fun part! I&#039;ll be offering 5 reviewers the chance to sample my product for free. In return, I&#039;d like a well written review concerning all aspects of the transaction - delivery, packaging, stealth, communication, product quality and the effects experienced. If you&#039;d like to be eligible, please PM me a link to a few reviews you have already written and I will select five people within the next week. I&#039;ll be aiming to post out the samples in just over a weeks time.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions or would like to know more, please don&#039;t hesitate to reply to this thread or PM me :)<br /><br />Freedom, Peace and Love,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

It feels like a great big family here who sell each other drugs.And if it helps to level up a new vendors reputation and trustworthiness then Im for it.<br /><br />And as for buying, I bought some weed, MDMA and acid just a few days ago, so Im covered, drugwise. Its not that I dont have the money. Its just wanting to be a important family member.<br /><br />But you probably dont get it.<br /><br />You sound very immature. Does mommy know youve been stealing her creditcard to buy drugs?

				This sounds great. I&#039;ve never tried edibles, so I&#039;ll certainly be keeping an eye out for your stock. I guess you&#039;ve probably run out of samples, but expect an order from me once you&#039;re up and running.

				Good morning, travellers!<br /><br />Thank you for all of the PM&#039;s both here on the forum and on my vendor account, I&#039;m so happy that there is considerable interest in my products.<br /><br />I&#039;d just like to clarify some things, since a lot of the PM&#039;s did not include any links to previously written reviews and some PM&#039;s presume I&#039;m already out of samples. On the contrary, I&#039;ll be taking approximately a week to select five reviewers, not only to give a wider variety of people the chance to apply, but also to ensure I can select reliable, honest reviewers. I don&#039;t need people to suck up to me, just the guarantee that I&#039;ll get a well written, honest review out of it. I&#039;ve already been contacted by obvious scammers, so as you can imagine it&#039;s important for me to separate the wheat from the chaff. From a business perspective, the samples are coming directly out of my own pocket and I&#039;m afraid I simply can&#039;t afford to just hand them out on a first come, first served basis. Please understand that I have to select people based on honesty, reliability and viability.<br /><br />I hope to get a good variety of reviews from different backgrounds and with different edibles experiences, so please don&#039;t be put off from applying if you&#039;ve never tried edibles before, it&#039;s not a problem! Both recreational and medicinal users are welcome and I hope to find reviewers of both types.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with Doc&#039;s thoughts. Having been a buyer here for well over a year, I have plenty of experience with both good and bad vendors. I sincerely hope I will become an asset to our wonderful community, as well as hopefully make it onto all of your &quot;good&quot; lists! :)<br /><br /><br />TL;DR Version:<br /><br />- I have not run out of samples, I will be taking a few days to select suitable reviewers.<br /><br />- In return, I&#039;d like a well written review concerning all aspects of the transaction - delivery, packaging, stealth, communication, product quality and the effects experienced.<br /><br />- If you&#039;d like to apply, please PM me a couple of links to reviews you have written previously.<br /><br />- Unfortunately I can&#039;t choose everyone, but I will be offering a small amount of stealth listed samples at a significantly reduced price to those who were suitable but weren&#039;t selected.<br /><br /><br />Freedom, Peace and Love,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				2.5g Cobra and 5g Cobra chocolate bars also listed. There was a slight miscalculation with the last batch, so each 2.5g or 5g bar contains a full 3g or 6g of hash, making each square a massive 250mg dose. Not recommended for edible newbies!

I licked a spatula that was ready to be washed from an earlier cook, apparently I underestimated just how potent the batch was!

				My review for sugarleafs chocolates&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Received 2 sample chocolates, 1 atlas hash and 1 cobra hash. Order sent on Sat. here Monday.<br /><br />5/5....The packaging is excellent, blends in with mail and has a return address. Choc&#039;s arrived in perfect condition, just like the picture.<br /><br />5/5....I had the Atlas hash chocolate for breakfast, the whole one as I&#039;m an everyday smoker and a greedy cow, lol! This was the dark ginger chocolate and I can&#039;t say I&#039;m a fan of dark, although it wasn&#039;t too bitter and tasted nice with a cup of tea. Lovely smooth luxury chocolate, did not taste the hash at all, you could easily offer someone one and they&#039;d have no idea they weren&#039;t from a box until later! :)<br /><br />5/5....Effects felt about about an hour later, crept up on me a bit. I suddenly thought &quot;what am I staring at on tv!&quot; My normal morning anxiety had vanished leaving me feeling very relaxed and in a nice mood. I still feel good 4 hours later and have functioned fine through the day. I think someone who isn&#039;t an everyday smoker would benefit from just half a chocolate. I can&#039;t wait to have the other one which is obviously going to be of the same standard! <br /><br />Overall a great vendor with excellent communication, stealth and product. I will be purchasing some soon. :)&nbsp; Thank You Sugarleaf, wonderful stuff...now to stay away from that other chocolate.....

				Good morning Sugarleaf and all!<br /><br />Hoping mine will arrive in the post today as I wasn&#039;t as lucky as mary666! Great to read your review, especially that it eased your morning anxiety - I know how that is..<br /><br />Anyhow, I have set aside tomorrow for magical exploration followed by a review, is there anything better to do with a&nbsp; day off? CAN&#039;T WAIT!<br /><br />

				Well I had an order arrive today, such lovely packaging. All the top tier stealth you could ever want and a nice little bit of branding on the inside.<br /><br />I&#039;ve eaten a chunk, it was a little soft when it arrived so be sure to get it in the fridge, I can feel it kicking in already from letting it sit in my mouth for a few minutes. The chocolate:hash ratio is clearly higher than mine and you can taste the potency, they are a much better sized dose for sublingualing than my huge Yorkies.<br /><br />The chocolate itself is well tempered and care has been taken over melting and setting points to prevent crystallization and keep the texture the same as the original chocolate.<br /><br />Looks like I&#039;ve got some competition...<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				To my reviewers and customers, I&#039;d like to thank you for being there at the beginning of this business. I realise I was not a vendor here for long, however, the time spent vending here was some of the happiest in my life. I sincerely hope that anyone who enjoyed or found medicinal relief from my products will get in touch. I haven&#039;t decided when I may start selling again, however, it will likely be done via private sales only, without using one of the existing markets (sheep, BMR) as I personally view them as being potentially compromised and do not wish to risk exposing my opsec to LEO. For the foreseeable future, sales will only be available to existing or trusted referred customers.<br /><br />Being a new vendor and considering my only involvement is with medicinal cannabis products, I realise I am very small time and am not likely to be a target for LEO. However, in times of uncertainty there is no such thing as being &quot;too paranoid&quot;.<br /><br />In my short time here I received a perfect 5/5 feedback score despite the newly implemented feedback system and the various &quot;newbie&quot; no/low-stat buyers I did business with. On a personal level, I received great feedback from every buyer, which was a huge point of pride for me. I have always taken customer service very seriously and have hoped to provide the best service possible. I hope this will be remembered by any of you who may decide to keep in touch. I am very eager to get &quot;back to business&quot; and have found through my work (and loss thereof) that this is a true passion and calling of mine, the knowledge that I have helped ease suffering in people is the greatest reward.<br /><br />Whilst I am NOT selling any products currently, if any one wishes to communicate directly with me, I can be contactable on sugarleaf@safe-mail.net. However, I will only be responding to emails fully encrypted with PGP. If you wish to stay in touch, please drop me an ENCRYPTED email with your SR forum/user name,&nbsp; your public PGP key and any other information you think may be relevant.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a very emotional few days, going from being on top of the world and happy with a career for the first time in my life, to feeling like I&#039;ve lost everything I worked for, including the significant amount of money invested to start up and the wonderful community I came to love over the past year and a half.<br /><br />As of now I truly believe the best course of action is to lay low and keep our heads down, which is why I will not be around on the new markets within the foreseeable future and only contactable via private encrypted emails.<br /><br />I sincerely hope to do business with you all again in the near future, perhaps once the dust settles.<br /><br />Freedom, Peace and Love,<br /><br />Sugarleaf<br /><br />PS. To the &quot;Parkinson&#039;s&quot; customer, I would still love to hear whether medicinal relief was found, both you and your friend have been on my mind and I hope to hear from you some day :) To the customers and reviewers that had issues with depression and/or anxiety, I also hope relief was found and that I will hear from you, too.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQINBFJFdrkBEAC8RiSIkcWMXAOjtsM+OuuAivT118GNO9KAWHMcnywZPnMe/zqe<br />7BQRD51t0/QpiU16SVAFFwSkB1svgnmWU+bIOqLeMv34+ykLXrAlZuN90Wh16iWC<br />kI6H6Lo/3RdtknvfiQGQ6Ap5ZRoBMTbEq9cT6p5A2eWRl0x6HNmXEM/ehViifSpa<br />f6ARs8tckkF55k0rDgtr/u1HDZkebaJCmqofAzTxdkfz/ZmwzfNFsl4A46sCXdEY<br />BabojJ2XIWdDZXGimbgya5N8cQvI1UEWNRZsE+etUPZKs3EdH6plmuPGyKnZNrva<br />ERKG0CqNHy0gS0ARa4TjKABLxrwYCjKDuVb5kYBBndwG0oMWeObbvB5YDXmkO8wQ<br />ye0QLd9YJgwNEMGWT1tGG4AWlaWhoH045Cd7oIugBOT87Cq6OTsaWjaHppFYh3Cq<br />H9bvnYYps0gs8fL4YVvJT2BgjSNdhV/2Tlq2uCcsR7kIs5h1YyaQsiSBCGwqZ34q<br />s6R+2SFITX9RnhwjBV2L5c2wp8blA4DSk8iEpspX6S/jAY5Z25aLnGIF76oVf3hY<br />nKCHdY6IyLAyq4n2UFeUtbb9J34aGkTHdlwmhgODCOtO+2+hyL4k2E2oeLEJvJWR<br />Tixr85jDFTORetBBXhy0cppY5lCvyeSEbFkZsgPmQQjWWTeXHJNyAfHoMQARAQAB<br />tCNTdWdhcmxlYWYgPHN1Z2FybGVhZkBzdWdhcmxlYWYuY29tPokCOAQTAQIAIgUC<br />UkV2uQIbAwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQ5Z7Rghf39rvdKA//<br />VpsIrIh0nSCHsLdLc5h5iGrMiiinQb/3EUZknDZAalzZqrvCM+C3SiUVkHsrY5uQ<br />J/7r+2aV2hQyHwoWxCELGUyK4dvT/kmH+6v44IifOSUN6XHE6IzotIpfwBoExAK9<br />WzRZeCoJzRAZJmyRgx6LTBeer3tPnN3i2oPytxOdG1u9f0RF/sAKuHUBl6uoOWxG<br />GUlKmpMI8nuak3peEQyfsbTnA6G1ZcD/AkSvCUWP2VuXEs+dxaNBcIgglscZPBtz<br />Mig4mDbjVmuMA0BEsGi6/fwUHMHDJbQKzuhHIaEHlFpB0BqkIelmGXkjvKA1oM0z<br />MOXj36gwgDjFbn9lhXOgo/xRXFqC6pU9KE12PvJyqL5UGpL4l+tMm3o5930IhwPi<br />7U70VOzmdTu2csj3Ntj1ZhE9V6bfw49exZEp+K69WAAbMf7oj/LhVXpniEptgA7P<br />XAT1CClOIu6yLzJpMh8eMFTida6UWjEWuh0W24vRdYTer2ulbP1AZo629n3TS7f2<br />O/EOr4ObQmmTHCQ7bIdMOSoD1mSkM2k7HU10B6fIVHeYHQylQwCgndTGltQPHnZU<br />RMZ9Ipzhm+xlgCVUcKiWXN1Te/SAh0do42XyvMqi4vlnnDZc+yThoCw9Uq3TV3Ab<br />rjrM8pMJLtLccr9kUbVkVtodZV5O4e0EC2/p7Vze3eS5Ag0EUkV2uQEQAMKnbu3j<br />tTD1LBittUubI/7krZwnqepG+kclWiuC+ZmGw/OLfE1hA6PEzcj6GsOYGRk45p9x<br />36gL4Yn3n7QYHbLeu+dW7cUNAY4PqLH1bQ8SBRqIfDAusHjQSrr96pxjibAB1m2u<br />g8Fzxado2aOvXFrU/F2y99I6lrhcQpc9I0cruwOAmIlrgmLIhp+PrgOK+Ce9igYh<br />N8k46waxmldF+JG7cb3a5ZfgoepzTRSIJmuhHBxfkE3eu/3eKjiQgPbaXdcq2oIk<br />upiqEKm6OYi2qCkFYVtG0HAMjtjlSOAwoOmHxfz/PhuqWIPRVwERtIt4siL5+RmO<br />9XZuZB3a9awqhw/RBOFOKlPQQIGgygWl8TLTkp9oUAOzAVtZuwIYhFMr4VYd6LBb<br />mgg9HB5Xq5r2ZoJfIc+Aq2diy9qWiTM0Nx7aQZXnD2JijQxlpERmFiskSj8KjOPu<br />KluBunE26IYYm3Ea/McoyZbGe8ARxwFFvFwYED7XlWB4ynM+Lj0r38dq3VOUVTgV<br />qO0/qthjJWO32y7LAKznLaughb/UwGQveOrexZ4XNl1ZQ4iERgbfIBhQdlR9zPcZ<br />ddRqu9H1+iv8VLtUIRVUwurz/kP/G9lc9Gx3Yamvhsac5fu+R4WpVSe8NeeNN8Vy<br />5qkDwqZDAUA3wqhGvl11upr/fXXJWtB4H1glABEBAAGJAh8EGAECAAkFAlJFdrkC<br />GwwACgkQ5Z7Rghf39rs2kw/7Bmn+HK1kvgCRob7V5KoiF71y0D/E3SPupLLF4kyR<br />4Svyh6sba9cWyQb4hxjOzknocAPeHC3l1uF53t5n9S+DlkAe7Tg6oHo/2niSBeSk<br />rZsFkfKOEUnBYKWJG0nNLLoHQgmsw6v74KeuQGvO92zhvYmHtC6qiZY+puep8Rkk<br />3Mx3NrzSpeT2pYqvjiGHT5oiUcSdqT9SMolemCBgfyi7vDE3jVzzOk84auFqGfLn<br />eXnwf9JlcK/vYYBCsvgZYj0lApnVZfeGHnK16fefbpTarG7Mz868r8CJpqWJGJT6<br />sdmqmbvB3HJ091H5u/k+aF45wYXii3MYqD5OcSzBRryyp+7f8NwE6j+8USCwtAK/<br />nvntlbcVd4PZslcr7obAqEBBxOedzhiklcwssa65QGWyn/LutJP7N/hX6JMKEfF5<br />BwNw6tU5DUIGDZz7nNpxUje9Av4xEX9apfqEHf30gNBO5fs5/imzUI53hbbB23Kq<br />ceIhxlYSLDThvvQdvtiX9vnimI63tJSMrOs/H8ZtLzAPbvC8HPpuoMboF06l9prv<br />+SrWJIKeyeTEu5Pfe8NfEi4H51agOwB0aWUAOkezil/XKL2k8ZOQCvzwEg7BUIGN<br />UNiiOKU8MKBsm5xzbb3wIIr2SYCc2iIL+aEnIymCm7nTVzkrzrW1ujBRCcOAVY/N<br />sCY=<br />=/n0A<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
