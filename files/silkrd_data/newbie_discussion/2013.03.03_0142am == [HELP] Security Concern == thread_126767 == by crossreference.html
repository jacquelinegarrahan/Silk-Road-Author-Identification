				WHAT&#039;S HAPPENED:<br /><br />1. I was already logged in to my SR account reading a message from a vendor who provided me with a custom listing link.<br /><br />2. I opened this link in a new tab (a http://silkroad********.onion.to/silkroad/item/********** link)<br /><br />3. This new link took me to what looked like the actual SR login page. (Remember I was already logged in reading my messages on the first tab)<br /><br />4. I logged in again at this link provided from this vendor on the new tab.<br /><br />5. It took me to the generic SR homepage and not to a custom listing.<br /><br />6. I panicked! Thought I had been phished so immediately logged out of this new tab.<br /><br />7. I changed my passphrase and pin on the original tab where I initially logged into SR.<br /><br />8. I then reopened the custom listing link provided again in a new tab, and it worked! It took me to the custom listing the vendor said he had created for me.<br /><br />QUESTIONS:<br /><br />1. Have I been phished? Or am I worrying about nothing?<br /><br />2. Should I created a new account?<br /><br />I&#039;m a rank novice. Fortunately I have no btc in my account here yet so even if I have been phished there is nothing to steal. I do plan on transferring a significant amount of btc into my SR account tomorrow though so need to know if my account has been compromised. Thank you.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve been phished - especially if you weren&#039;t asked for your PIN.<br /><br />Also, you should NOT be accessing SR at the .to address - that is for accessing it over the clearnet which you should never, never, never do!&nbsp; So dangerous.

				Thanks for responding quickly, scout.<br /><br />I&#039;m a complete newb to SR, and thus far I&#039;ve only always logged into SR at the standard http://silkroad*******.onion url. But the link this vendor provided for my custom listing was the one described above: http://silkroad********.onion.to/silkroad/item/**********<br /><br />Has this made me vulnerable? I&#039;m connecting through a VPN and TOR, but has accessing this link somehow revealed my real IP to other parties???<br /><br />What should I tell this vendor? Can he create the custom listing with a normal .onion link?<br /><br />Thanks again, scout. I&#039;m worried as hell right now.

				clearnet = internet accessed normally without the use of Tor.<br /><br />the VENDOR sent you .to links?&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; that is not smart at all ... if you&#039;re on Tor, you should be fine, but, still, it&#039;s best never to use .to links .... if someone gives you a link like that, copy and paste it into the URL bar but before navigating there, remove the &quot;.to&quot; part.

				Okay. I get it. I wasn&#039;t even aware you could access SR or .onion locations without TOR. I never have and never will. I always go through the VPN and TOR before coming to SR or this forum (the only .onion sites I know of), and have every other internet accessing program deactivated on my computer when doing so.<br /><br />Yes, the vendor sent me that link. He has proven to be a really helpful vendor giving me advice pertaining to BTC purchases and transfers and has perfect feedback with hundreds of transactions. I really look forward to my first SR transaction being with this vendor. He has since replied that he inadvertently forgot to remove the .to part of the link so I guess it was an honest error.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind could you confirm this for me though: Is it perfectly safe to purchase my BTC from spendbitcoins and have them placed directly into my SR account? Or should I have them placed into a BlockChain wallet before transferring them to my SR account?<br /><br />Thanks again, scout.

				That is totally up to you.&nbsp; SR does have its own built-in coin tumbler and for many people, that is enough.&nbsp; Others prefer sending to another wallet first.&nbsp; It really is just a matter of what makes you feel the safest.

				Thanks, scout. You&#039;ve been very helpful. If I were cashed up I&#039;d donate to your fund.
