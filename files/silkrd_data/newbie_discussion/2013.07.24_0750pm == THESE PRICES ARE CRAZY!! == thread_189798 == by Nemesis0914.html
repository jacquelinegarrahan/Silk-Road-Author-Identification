				not only is it convenient, but if a seller sends you bunk blow, you can take it to resolution and might get a refund. Call up your street dealer complaining about poor qualirty and you&#039;ll probably get shanked. I&#039;m happy to pay more to avoid shit like that.

				I do think convenience is part of it. Also you can talk to folks in the forums about vendors to make sure your stuff is not bunk. Also the vendors have shipping cost and some other overhead.

				Nemesis0914 I can agree with what you are saying. I can get quality drugs right down the street for a cheaper price. I also don&#039;t have to worry about the postal service opening my packages and letters when I purchase off the street. I would like to see a new vendor with the revolutionary idea that offering drugs for a lower price then everyone else means more business. Cocaine prices are above average. Weed prices become above average when u include shipping and handling. I myself imagine that a lot of dealers re supply themselves through using this website. At these already high taxed prices a man cant even stand to make a good living. That being said I still love and support the SR. It is a very friendly place compared to your neighborhood smack den.

				the vendors have postage and other overheads............postage is paid on top of the already crazy prices and that aint cheap either you are talking in the region of 4gbp to post a couple of acid dommestic.......i mean come on a stamp 1st class is 60p and an envolope 10p add that to the 10-15 gbp you are already paying for an acid........ i remember the days when you could buy 100 acid for less than 1.00 gbp each and 1 for 2.00-2.50 lol but alas you dont see them any more except on here, but even given that fact im still not prepared to pay that much, i can get good quality mdma for a lot less than on here so ill settle for that&nbsp; ;D

				I don&#039;t think SR was made for a dealer to re-up. like others have said, because you have to pay convenience fees. There is not a lot of wiggle room. Unless you are getting huge amounts of RX at bulk prices. I&#039;ve made a little from SR that way, but then again in my region RX is high in demand, so I can charge a premium price. IE: oxy 80s 60.00 opana 40 ER 60.00 IR 200.00 each to a pin cushion 150.00 to an tooter. that&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyway, SR seems more like a consumers choice rather then a dealer. IMO of course.

				Right I mean for dealer to dealer large quantity stuff I&#039;m going to go ahead guess most of that stuff occurs OOE once the parties have established a relationship.<br /><br />Also no one is forcing anyone to buy on SR, I mean, if a buyer is happy with street quality and prices that is their prerogative.

				The quality of the products on the Road are generally much higher than products on the streets. Also, you are having the convenience of having drugs mailed to you.
