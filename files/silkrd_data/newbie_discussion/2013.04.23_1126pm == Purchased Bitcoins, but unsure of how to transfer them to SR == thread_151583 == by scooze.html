				Hi, I purchased some Bitcoins using bitinstant, and everything worked just fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had them sent to my email address, and would like to transfer them to my account at SR. <br /><br />Can I use coinapult to send them to SR? <br /><br />Thanks...

				How did you get them sent to your email address ? , bitcoin is kept in a wallet on your pc as far as i am aware. <br />Are you sure that was not an email receipt sent to you and the coin is waiting to be transfered to your wallet from bitinstant ?<br /><br />If you want to transfer funds to SR, you first need to login to your account and then&nbsp; go to account at top of page.<br />On your account page you will see an address where you can send your bitcoin. That is your address at SR and no one else has access to that.&nbsp; You send the bitcoin to that addy from your bitcoin client on your pc. <br />It can take a while, anything from 20 mins to several hours depending.<br /><br />

				I believe coinapult uses SMS (text) or email to send the coins.&nbsp; Personally I think thats a bad idea as it could be traceable and I wouldnt send direct to SR like that.&nbsp; <br /><br />You could use that to send them to a wallet you have created under fictitous info, then transfer to SR.&nbsp; That would be much safer in my opinion.

				That has got to be one of the best methods I have ever read...Have like basically a 3rd or even 4th party wallet so you know very well its secure...Smart Idea

				I personally like https://localbitcoins.com&nbsp; <br /><br />Super easy and free and they charge a minimal fee to transfer, but so does Mt. Gox and most other sites.&nbsp; It&#039;s totally anonymous and you can change your bitcoin address as frequently as need be.&nbsp; I like it because you can send bitcoins to and from SR and then if you want to cash out bitcoins, send them to a site that is hooked up to a place where you can can deposit the money into your bank account anonymously.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; Take some time and read up on it.&nbsp; Also cool is bitfloor.com&nbsp; &nbsp;Another very easy to use site.
