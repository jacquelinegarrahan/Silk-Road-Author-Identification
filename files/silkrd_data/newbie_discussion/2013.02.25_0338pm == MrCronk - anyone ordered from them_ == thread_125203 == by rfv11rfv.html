				I ordered last wednesday. was quickly marked in transit. didnt FE. aint heard anything from him. <br /><br />Was a thread a couple days ago with another user, who did FE reporting similar. <br /><br />--<br /><br />As far as i can make out, he ran into similar issues at xmas, just was too busy, the orders did seem to eventually come though.

				My guess is that the orders will come, he couldn&#039;t have built up such a high ranking without ripping ppl left right and center. <br /><br />His recent feedback seem to suggest orders have been taking around a week to arrive. <br /><br />

				Ordered 2 weeks ago and it took around 2 days for him to process it and then a further 2 days to arrive. I imagine that because of the high amount of orders he gets, it may take a while to get to you.

				@rfv11rfv<br /><br />That sounds positive anyways however cryptic and questionable his reason for the tardiness. <br /><br />There was a bit of ice and snow last week in some areas too in fairness.

				I ordered my first and only order (so far :P) from MrCronk around 1 month ago now.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was put In Transit a few hours later &amp; it arrived 2 days later.<br /><br />Although I was a newbie and wanted to make sure I was doing everything right, I recieved no reply from them at any point which I put down to just being really busy. <br /><br />All in all, genuine guy with great product/prices.<br />

				I received a PM from him 23 hours ago (hadn&#039;t logged in a while) and he said how it takes him 10 mins to reply to each PM which I can believe with tor so slow. Anyway he apologised for any delay. I think he gets a ton of orders so can take a few days for dispatch.

				Yeah don&#039;t worry about it mate if you have sent him a message you&#039;ll most likely get it a couple of day&#039;s later,it took mine a week and it came 2 day&#039;s after I contacted him so i&#039;m presuming he had some kind of fuck up last week or something,don&#039;t worry about getting it mate it&#039;ll get to you,aslong as he know&#039;s your still waiting,Cronk&#039;s a solid seller.<br /><br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)

				Seems to be one the best value and quality vendors for skunk on here, even though I would usually just buy hash off here and sort skunk irl some of MrCronks deals have looked tempting and i&#039;ve heard good things about the product.

				I&#039;ve been talking to MrCronk since my order took too long to arrive. He has a canned message he sends out to everyone, and it does seem that he is just struggling with his workflow. If you buy from him, allow a week or so for it to come. Can&#039;t afford a week for delivery? Find another vendor. I will be buying from him again, but not when I&#039;m in a hurry.

I got a zip of his haze. Maybe haze is just different where I&#039;m from but it definately didn&#039;t seem to have that distinct haze smell... at all. It just seemed like some hydroponictly grown indica. Very &quot;wet&quot; and when smoked it seemed to resin up anything I used about 5 times faster than any other weed I&#039;ve smoked. I can&#039;t speak for his other strains but the &quot;haze&quot; was average at best. That coupled with the long delivery time and the fact it&#039;s coming from another country to it has to go through customs all made me decide to look elsewhere.

				My first order on SR was of 2g thai weed from MrCronk last Friday - FE as per request (being my first transaction and all - stupid mistake now!?) and have had nothing in the post at all (UK -&gt; UK). <br /><br />Messaged him asking whats the deal, nothing arrived, no message but no responses at all (as of yet)... on that listing it seems some people are saying &#039;super fast delivery&#039; and getting orders... others complaining its taking ages, and others are just FE (who may never receive orders?)<br /><br />I ordered something else from another vendor the same day and it arrived Monday no problems i&#039;m glad to say.<br /><br />Bit of a shame being my first purchase from him and order not shown up at all / no replys to my messages at all as of yet.... Guess its my own fault for FE, wont do that next time! Shoulda read the forums for advice before ordering :) <br /><br />I&#039;ll update if something ever does show up.... time to try a different vendor instead.

				How does his Thai weed compare to the standard weed you&#039;d get from street dealers in the UK? That is to say, if you paid £20 for 1.6g as is standard nowadays would you feel massively ripped off or no more so than usual?

				Ordered 9 days ago and still nothing.&nbsp; Took 3 days just to dispatch.&nbsp; Plenty of feedback saying a week or more for domestic delivery, too.&nbsp; Why des he put free next day delivery in the title of every item?<br /><br />Also ordered from The Herbalist a few days ago and nothing yet.&nbsp; Very annoyed but slightly paranoid.

They&#039;re only doing 2 different strains at £30 and £35 for 3.8g at the moment, but I smoke some the other day and it is chronic! Next day delivery if you order before 2 and good stealth. 100% feedback although they are relatively new.
