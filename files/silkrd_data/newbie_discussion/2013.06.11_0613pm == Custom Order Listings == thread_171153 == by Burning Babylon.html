				Title: <strong>Custom Order Listings</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I have some questions on how a Custom Order ( or just a temporary listing in general ) is intended to work.<br /><br />A) After a customer has ordered a Custom Order and received it, are there any drawbacks to removing that listing entirely from the profile as&nbsp; for example losing feedback from that specific listing or should it be left alone with 0 quantity as a listing?<br />B) Are there any rules at all as to what would qualify for a Custom Order? Basically are there no limits on how many Custom Orders can be posted at any one time?<br />C) Is there any problem with creating a separate shipping option for a Custom Order only meant for that specific order as it may for example weigh a lot more etc. ?<br />D) If someone else than the original recipient orders a Custom Listing not intended for them, is it fine to just cancel that order and tell them it was for someone else without any trouble?<br /><br />If there&#039;s anything relevant which is unique to Custom Orders that I&#039;ve forgotten to ask which someone knows please post whoever sees this. :)

				No one has any idea so far?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I would like to add the following question as one of my customers said he had this problem with other vendors for Custom Orders:<br /><br />E) Are there any restrictions on shipping options when using a Custom Order such as not being able to use a free shipping option?

				Coming back to answer all of my old questions as I&#039;ve figured them out now.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />A) There are no drawbacks, listings who get deleted retain their feedback for four months after their deletion. For more information: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32573.msg370788#msg370788<br />B) I&#039;ve found nothing indicating any kind of restriction, and with the ability to delete listings after they&#039;ve been used that issue is solved either way.<br />C) No issues as far as I can tell as multiple vendors do this all the time.<br />D) Can be solved by doing a stealth listing and sending that link to the buyer the Custom Order is intended for.<br />E) No restrictions. I had a customer who claimed Custom Orders would only work if they had an option of minimum 0.01 BTC in postage, this turned out to be false though and free shipping works just as good.
