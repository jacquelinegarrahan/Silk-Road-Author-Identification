				Review: 1 capsule of 70 mg of Vyvanse<br /><br />Communication 5 of 5 - Great communication. Pillfire quickly responded to my messages and kindly agreed to send me a sample.<br /><br />Stealth/Shipping 5 of 5 - The stealth was totally adequate for a single pill sample and the label was pro. Also, Pillfire processed and shipped it quickly and I received it within a few days.<br /><br />Product 5 of 5 - This was my first time ever trying Vyvanse and I must say that I think it is great! I&#039;ve used Adderall as a study aid and for recreation but it had been several years since I&#039;d had any pharmaceutical amphetamine. I honestly think this stuff beats adderall, especially considering how long it lasts. I took it just after 8 this morning and noticed stimulation within an hour. I experienced strong euphoria and energy but it felt cleaner and more lucid than adderall. I have been extremely focused and energized all day and just when I think its going to end, I get another wave of goodness. It has now been about 6 and a half hours and I&#039;m definitely still feeling great, though the stimulation is not as pronounced. I would definitely recommend taking it for studying or just for helping you get a lot of shit done while feeling great.<br /><br />The sample was free but I sure hope Pillfire sells them for a reasonable price because I would definitely like to purchase some in the future! All in all, 5 out of 5 and I highly recommend PillfirePharmacy!!

				Astyanax I&#039;m glad you loved it so much!&nbsp; It&#039;s a really cool drug and like I told you if you have a garage to clean, or a house to build, it&#039;s the PERFECT drug!&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope to be open within the next week.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback I really appreciate it! Enjoy the rest of the wave!<br /><br />Superman25 sorry no more free samples.&nbsp; I have plenty of product so no worries there when they&#039;re up for sale I&#039;ll be ready to ship immediately.<br /><br />I&#039;m going 100% by the book - following all SR rules so please don&#039;t message me asking for product before the store is open.&nbsp; Thanks

				Received my sample as well.<br />Suboxone Strip &amp; Vyvanse 70mg<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5 Perfect. Took about a week from when he said it was sent.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5 Great printed envelope, sufficient on the inside for such a small sample. <br /><br />Communication: 5/5 Absolutely perfect! Stayed in contact with me from start to finish!<br /><br />Quality: 5/5 Took the strip yesterday when it arrived, took the vyvanse today. I have had both before and they are on par with the others.<br />I do have one con: I don&#039;t like that the suboxone strip package was cut open. Should have left it sealed. Other then that, everything was perfect.<br /><br />Excellent Job Pillfire (FirePharmacy)

				Purplepanth thanks for the review.&nbsp; Glad all went well. <br /><br />Juggernog thanks a lot!&nbsp; The reason the package was cut was the Suboxone strips can be traced to the pharmacy they&#039;re from by the number on the package.&nbsp; Just a safety precaution for your and my protection should it get into the wrong hands.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen police at the doctor&#039;s office tracing strips back to patients.&nbsp; If I can come up with a way to destroy the serial # and make it unreadable without cutting the package I&#039;ll do that.

				Yes it&#039;s relevant my profile name on SR is PillfirePharmacy.&nbsp; I sent out free samples to let people know what they can expect for product, shipping, stealth, communication.&nbsp; I am not open yet, but as soon as I get my btc transferred for the bond I&#039;ll be an official vender.&nbsp; Just doing some homework before I take any payments for product.

				Yeah hopefully these reviews will be enough to get the ball rolling for you once you get your vendor account.<br />There is a lot of risk for buyers to take samples from a new vendor. Luckily I have disposable addresses just for this situation :)<br /><br />Anyway now others can see you are trustworthy so far! :)<br /><br />BTW your package could not have come at a better time. I just ran out of my usual drug just a few hours before I got it.<br />I felt better from the strip then I did from the H i had, lol.
