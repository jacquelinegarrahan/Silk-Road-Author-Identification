				So I was wondering.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since colarado and washington both have legalized pot to small amounts,&nbsp; &nbsp;how has that effected street price or quality?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I mean would it be worth it to make a trip there and pick up some as opposed to ordering off Sr?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does anyone have first hand exp?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />In my mind im thinking you could almost go to any town now and find some high quality buds.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes No?

				I hope nobody is dumb enough to post what state they live in..&nbsp; Honestly though, I doubt it changed the dynamic that much.&nbsp; People in Washington and Colorado STILL can&#039;t legally grow it or sell it, so...

				You can legally grow and possess a certain amount in co and wa now.&nbsp; &nbsp; Not federal of course but state wise.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would just assume that every town would have someone taking advantage of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Also nobody was posting what state they lived in.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just a general discussion thread lol.

				well if you think you&#039;re going to just drive into some random town and find some dude selling qp&#039;s of dank for $650, you are quite mistaken.

				From what I hear the state is going to tax and sell it themselves at some point.&nbsp; &nbsp;And when that happens then why wouldn&#039;t local growers get in on it?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you can drive into say chicago and find any type of drug you are looking for right?&nbsp; So why would you not be able to go into a state where it was legalized and find it just as easy if not more?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My point is now that it isn&#039;t illegal to have said amount, then more people are going to be growing and selling.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that should drive price down.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yea it is prob going to take a while for the state to figure out the fed problem. <br /><br />But since they are counting on tax revenue I am sure the states will come up with something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Price might drop for a bit but then they will. Just keep raising the tax on it just like tobacco is.

				Have any of you folks actually read the laws that were passed?&nbsp; It is far from legal in either state.&nbsp; In WA the general population cannot grow.. at least Colorado will let folks grow a few plants.
