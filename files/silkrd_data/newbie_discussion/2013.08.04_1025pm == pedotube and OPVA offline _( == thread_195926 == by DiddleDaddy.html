I just recently saw a documentary about about the &#039;Romany Gypsies&#039; in&nbsp; Romania .... man! that place has some pretty fucked up shit going on with getting the kids under&nbsp; 13-14 where LE wont charge them for petty theft etc so these kids go around roaming the streets looking for people to pickpocket or even simply &quot;outright steal whatever they can get their hands on of value<br />&nbsp;<br />They also pimp out the young girl ar &quot;sell them&quot; for marriage or maybe prostitution, a &quot;virgin&quot; (with an &#039;intact hymen&#039; as confirmed by a &#039;specialist&#039;, which is sometimes a Dr butt usually this old old woman who is &quot;supposed to know&quot; about all this&nbsp; &nbsp;.... it&#039;s REALLY FUCKED UP and that&#039;s only Romania<br /><br />The trafficking of children worldwide each year is considered to be about 600,000 children a year, are bought or sold into some form of ..... slavery really.&nbsp; the girls in the forced marriages are nothing but the husbands slave!&nbsp; Sometimes things actually &#039;work out&#039; and the couple are happy, but IIRC 80% of arranged/forced marriages are over within 5years (but I&#039;m really too stoned to be writing something so &#039;serious&#039;&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna stop now, thanks for reading ! ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;A truly complex issue!&nbsp; For a long time, EVERY grrrl I met, had been sexually abused by someone, (and sometimes more than one person!) &#039;And they ALL&nbsp; eventually told me&#039; (and I was often the &#039;first person&#039; to find out!&nbsp; :o)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They hadn&#039;t even told their BFF&#039;s, so here I was the poor&nbsp; BF (with basically NO fuckin idea, &quot;what, when, where, who,&nbsp; to do!, to &#039;get help&#039; for my (usually at that time, suicidal, and talking it up etc!&nbsp; :o :P ?&quot;<br /><br />One of&nbsp; my long term GF&#039;s (who&#039;s now been married now for about 15years!, to one&nbsp; of my oldest friends! the cunt!
