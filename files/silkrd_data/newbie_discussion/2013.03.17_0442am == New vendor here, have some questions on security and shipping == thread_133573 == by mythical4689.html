				Hi all,<br /><br />First of all, apologies if these questions are answered elsewhere, I&#039;ve read the buyers and sellers guides, and have done some browsing here on the forums and tried to read whatever I can find, but still have some questions. As a background, I am new to SR, bitcoins, and Tor, so all of this is still pretty new to me. I didn&#039;t see any sort of posting guidelines about stuff that shouldn&#039;t be asked or something, so if Im asking anything that shouldnt be asked, or breaking any sorts of rules/conventions, doing anything stupid, whatever, *please* let me know.<br /><br />Also, I just want to add, I genuinely want to do this right, take this very seriously, and want to take all of the necessary precautions, for both my sake and for my potential buyers&#039; sake, so any and all suggestions, comments, whatever, are greatly appreciated - I genuinely mean that. (And to mention, this is a different account than the account Ive set up to be my future vendor account)<br /><br />On to the questions...<br /><br />1) In order to pay the 500$ bond for a new vendor account, it&#039;s my understanding that I need to buy bitcoins and then transfer them to the bitcoin address given in my account page. However, Mt.Gox and other places Ive checked where I could buy bitcoins at all seem to require you to give identifying information, and additionally, Mt.Gox wont allow you to connect to the site using Tor. I am worried that if I set up an account using any real (or fake, for that matter) information and then send the 500 to the address given, that is a potential security issue for me. Is this something I should be concerned with? Is there any way to anonymously buy bitcoins/have a bitcoin wallet/account somewhere without having to give out identifying information? Ultimately I&#039;ll also need to withdraw the bitcoins to currency, so what methods/sites do other people use to make that process as anonymous/secure as possible?<br /><br />2) I am planning on focusing exclusively on selling pills. As far as shipping goes, I&#039;ve done some looking around, and USPS seems to be the cheapest, fastest option, as compared to FedEx/UPS. What shipping company do most people use? Is there a reason not to use USPS? As far as actually shipping the pills, I was planning on getting one of those food saver vacuum packagers and double sealing/packing the pills, then putting the sealed bag into something else to hide the contents. I was thinking of using some other kind of product box, opening it, removing the contents, putting the sealed bag in the box, then taking a hot glue gun and re-sealing the box. Maybe something like a box of candy or something (is it a bad idea to mention that I was thinking of doing it this way?) -- if it&#039;s okay to ask, what do other vendors here do to conceal their shipments, particularly for pills? Also, I was thinking shipping in small boxes would be better than shipping in envelopes -- is that true? Any input on that would be appreciated.<br /><br />3) On the same topic of shipping, I was wondering what other people do as far as putting a return address. I was thinking of either using a fake address, or getting an anonymous PO box (can you get anonymous PO boxes?) and using that. Also, when it comes to printing labels (I read somewhere on here that printing them is better than handwriting them), should I print them at home/get a label printer? I am a little concerned that some printers print hidden identifying stuff somewhere anytime they print, is that something to be wary of? Should I simply take the package to the shipping company and have them print the label? In short, if anyone could give me some advice on printing labels/let me know what they do for that sort of thing, it&#039;d be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />That&#039;s it for now. Really appreciate any feedback/info.

				1. Lookup vendor BlueSkyTraders you can discreetly buy bitcoins from him by doing a deposit at a Bank of America locally.<br />2. Most people use USPS<br />3. Email me at fours22@tormail.org I can help you out if you send me some samples of your pills. Kinda to detailed questions to be posted on here.

				If you&#039;re doing pills, vacuum sealing and then placing that package in an xray proof baggie (google them) is pretty standard procedure. Concealing the pills in a product box is not necessary for retail distribution. A letter containing a few blank pieces of paper and the goods will do. As far as the return address goes, post a real one as a fake one is a red flag in the system. Do not use a return address that can ever be linked back to you. I suggest making a few orders from a separate buying account from the other vendors in the market to see how its done firsthand.
