				I just received something very special in the mail yesterday. I bought 10 stamps of LSD from freedompeople. I took half a blotter about 9 hours ago, the effects were noticeable but not very intense. I basically had a permanent smile on my face for a few hours, I found the city lights to be very interesting, I was annoyed when my buddy kept asking me questions about the effects and music felt more special. Not the hardcore hallucinations I was expecting. I will take a full blotter two days from now see if it&#039;s going to be more intense. Overall it was a good experience, but I can&#039;t say life changing. I still don&#039;t want to say LSD is overrated because that&#039;s obviously not the case and want to see how it feels on a full dose. If you guys have any advice, I would appreciate.

				I should also mention that this was my first drug purchase from SR and I&#039;m very glad it went this smooth. I was very anxious waiting for it 9 days but in the end, I felt&nbsp; like a kid opening up a christmas present. This is also the first drug I ever took that isn&#039;t cannabis. I don&#039;t know anyone who has taken LSD before, so I was a little scared, thats why Ionly took half a blotter. Better be safe than sorry :)

				DONT DO 1500µg if this is your first drug xp ;)<br /><br />i can highly recommend watching a movie, Dredd is super awesome for lsd if you can handle it, or else stick to some comedy

				Thanks for the tips, I do feel pretty stupid now for taking only 1/2 a blotter, I was really looking forward to this. I will be giving some to my friends though, hopefully they&#039;ll feel it more intense so I&#039;ll know what to expect next week.

				I&#039;ve never really had any suicidal thoughts and overall I am happy with who I am as a person. The two things that scared me before taking it were that I would either feel nothing at all or feel overwhelmed. Of course whenever I brought the subject on lsd, everyone seemed to have this friend of a friend that saw dead people and had a heart attack, or the guy that thought he could fly and jumped out the window. I think that is utter bullshit. The reason I wanted to try LSD so bad was to explore my mind and have a better understanting of the world as it is. I think this drug should be respected and used with care and responsibility. Even though I wished for a more intense experience, I&#039;m still happy that it offered me a teaser and now I know the stuff is legit.

				I would recommend taking around 200-300 ug if you want a good trip. I don&#039;t recommend watching a movie as previously mentioned. Although this can be fun, it probably won&#039;t give you the insightful trip you are looking for. Listen to some good music instead. Don&#039;t trip with someone that isn&#039;t tripping as well or is not at least experienced with lsd. Go for a hike or go camping for a very nice experience. Otherwise, its nice to just chill out and see where it takes you. The more you empty your mind, the more space their is for new insight and peace. Good luck with your journey.<br /><br />Love and Light,<br />C Tuna
