				Hi piggies, I hope you gain a brain and a conscience as you peruse our wonderful forum of evil brainless drug users. <br />The first 10 swine to message me will be rewarded with a 10 pack of krispy kremes.<br />.... And a big shout pout to the cops who are using Silk Road for their personal drug needs. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a stack of you hypocrites here. <br />As for the Feds, please don&#039;t forget that you&#039;re still just cops.

				Its a shame the police dont understand our plight. :P<br /><br />The government is more than happy to flood our country with tobacco and alcohol, as a result people continue to die from cancer, liver damage, the works.<br /><br />Who the fuck are they to tell us what WE can put into our bodies? Like seriously WTF?<br /><br />They want a dumbed down society, it keeps that viscous circle spinning.<br /><br />Imagine what would happen if the majority of us were no longer buying alcohol and cigarettes?<br /><br />People would live longer, and the hospitals would have less patients in them, but the government dont want that. Less people drinking means less road fatalities right? Oh but then the hospitals wont be full, those guys out in the ambulances arent earning their money, were not paying them to drive around. Population would steady, and then people would find themselves out of work.<br /><br />The goverment want your money and dont give a damn about you or your health. They would have banned tobacco years ago if they cared. Get rid of the ridiculous amount of bottle shops, seriously there a fucking eye sore, and the way they advertise it? Fuck me, hey lets all go drinking tonight, woohoo.<br /><br />The police who are so hell bent on stopping this simply have no idea of what it is like, they are within a fucking nut shell of themselves.<br /><br />Its not a war against drugs, the drugs we take are all about stopping wars. The police could do with some and learn to lighten up and open their damn minds.<br /><br />LE, police, FEDS, why dont you all get a real job and actually help your community getting the bad guys. Trying to bust drug users is just a joke. <br /><br />Wake up and live a little.

				Whatever you do, don&#039;t believe the myth that &quot;cops can&#039;t lie.&quot;&nbsp; This is obviously bullshit, as there would be no undercover cops if they couldn&#039;t legally lie, but some people still believe that if you ask a police officer if he is police, then he is legally required to say yes.&nbsp; That&#039;s some bullshit; he&#039;s well within his rights when he tells you &quot;hell no man, I ain&#039;t no fuckin cop.&quot;

				Also if you&#039;re ever arrested/detained/cited for anything worse than a speeding ticket, DON&#039;T TALK TO THE COPS.<br /><br />Anything you say can and WILL be used against you in court.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason police officers are required to say that.&nbsp; Wait for your lawyer.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever talk to the cops in a situation where you&#039;re a suspect without your lawyer present.&nbsp; They WILL find something to incriminate you with.&nbsp; Cops are all about closing cases.&nbsp; If you say something incriminating, even if you didn&#039;t do it, the cops are going to use that to press charges against you.&nbsp; That&#039;s all a lot of officer care about: numbers.&nbsp; They want open and shut cases.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give them a reason to press charges by trying to explain your side of the story.<br /><br />YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, USE IT.

Silk Road is the poster child when it comes to what they call &quot;deep web&quot; (I giggle every time I hear someone use this term for Silk Road, or any publicly known .onion website, or an .onion website that is indexed for that matter)-- it&#039;s what media uses to showcase what the &quot;deep web&quot; has to offer. Silk Road is the eBay of the underbelly of the internet, a website for Mom &#039;n&#039; Pop businesses (vendors). I also very much agree with you when you say that it&#039;s only a market, very true. I think the media should focus on bringing more light onto the truly disgusting websites which showcase pedophilia, animal cruelty, etc., instead of Silk Road, but of course why would they? It&#039;s too shocking, people don&#039;t want to see that, they want to see a website that is supposed to contain the biggest &quot;O.G&#039;s&quot;, crime lords, true &quot;ballers&quot; and the biggest scumbags on planet earth -- that&#039;s what Hollywood and media has done to the average drug dealer/user anyway. <br /><br />If you ever read some of the news articles on Silk Road on the surface web, you&#039;d get the assumption that every user on Silk Road, whether a buyer or seller is Tony Montana or Al Capone, and if you read some of the comments left on those news articles by some, how should I put this? &quot;Very knowledgeable&quot; people you&#039;d get the assumption that if you badmouth any user on Silk Road, you&#039;d get tracked down and chopped up to bits and fed to the pooches. People, are relatively, or extremely nice and caring on Silk Road, it&#039;s like some say a family - like a long lost cousin you&#039;d provide support and care, just because he&#039;s family. Even if you don&#039;t know his name, age or his background origin. Compared to the real &quot;deep web&quot; drug markets, Silk Road would be considered a PG website. <br /><br />~ Cooler.

				There is, posts off here have been used as evidence. Assume we&#039;re all cops, EVERYONE on here is a cop waiting for the SLIGHTEST bit of info from you to send you to jail for EVER AND EVER!!<br /><br />Seriously, the slightest shred of info, even if it doesn&#039;t give a direct line to you, can help pad a case and be used as evidence. As I said, assume we&#039;re all cops.
