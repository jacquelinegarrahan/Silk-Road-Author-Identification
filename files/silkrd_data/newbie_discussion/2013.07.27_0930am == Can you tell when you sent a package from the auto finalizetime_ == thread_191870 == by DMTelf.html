				I&#039;m trying to work out when I sent a package, and it just occurred to me you can probably do this from the auto-finalize time, but I&#039;m not sure how this works. Does this start at 17 days and then just decrease every day, and when it runs out the escrow money is automatically put into your account?<br /><br />Just I have someone who is claiming their sample never arrived and it&#039;s been in transit (I think) 10 days now as the auto finalize is 7 days. This is EU &gt; EU.<br /><br />That&#039;s way too long for EU&gt;EU, right?
