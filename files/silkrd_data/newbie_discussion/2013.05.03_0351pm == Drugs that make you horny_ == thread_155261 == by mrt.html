				xtc never made me horny at all, it made me want to cuddle and talk a lot or get up and dance, or just watch the lights, but I don&#039;t think I could have had sex if I tried on it.<br /><br />meth made me go for hours, which isn&#039;t as great as it sounds either

				mephedrone - although it also causes vasoconstriction so it makes you horny but it also makes it difficult to get/keep an erection...

				Methylone = bk-mdma, I&#039;ve tried that together with 4-FMA.<br /><br />Made me pretty horny for sure, but not as great as with<br />speed or meth and smoking jwh-018 or am-2201.<br /><br />Mephedrone?

It was massively fun but also had horrible side affects once I moved from recreational use to full-blown addiction. You got to know when a drug has kicked your ass and that it&#039;s time to walk away.

				A couple of doses of good old ethanol.<br /><br />It&#039;s a vasodilator, meaning it widens your blood vessels. More blood to the sex organs is always good.<br />

				Any favorite drug is good, XTC and acid are great.&nbsp; If you use Cialis it really helps to keep you hard when your mind drifts off.

				Testosterone. Easily. 3-6 mg of ester kept under the tongue for a couple of minutes takes effect almost immediately. It works for women too, but the dose has to be 0.5 mg to 1 mg max. DHEA can also help if you&#039;re older than 50 and low on the hormone. Only a blood test can determine that. BTW, the same goes for testosterone. Most people are low and don&#039;t even know it. Have your total and free testosterone checked and you&#039;ll see what I mean.
