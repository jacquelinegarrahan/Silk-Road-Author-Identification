				Do not buy from this vendor if you are new to Silk road.&nbsp; He is a fraud, a liar and a cheat.&nbsp; He will take your money and not ship.&nbsp; He uses the excuse of you not having 10 transactions and hides behind that to increase his bottom line.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he justifies this to himself by having been taken advantage of by buyers.&nbsp; Whatever, he will steal from you.&nbsp; I do not understand why SR allows him to operate on their site.

				@MSB<br /><br />It s you that has his product, can&#039;t you tell us?<br /><br />@tunatrouble<br /><br />Thats bad form that. You lose much? how long have you been waiting? Was it an international order? What has he said in your follow up messages? <br /><br />Does he have a vendor review thread on the main forums? If so get to 50 posts and go post there. a lot.
