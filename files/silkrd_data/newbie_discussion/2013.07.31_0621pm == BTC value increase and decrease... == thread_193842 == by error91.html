				Ok so i&#039;m very new to the whole thing with using bitcions &amp; SR etc. (I only got my first purchase through today) and I know that the price of BTC fluctuates constantly.<br /><br />When i bought my first lot of BTC they were valued at something like, 62.50 but then 4 days later (today) they peaked at £72.50! If the value of BTC were to shoot up even more, do the vendors on SR and other sites change their prices accordingly? <br /><br />i.e if a gram of coke is valued at 0.8 BTC which for example was £80, if the BTC rate shot up and 0.8 BTC was now £100, will the vendor change his price so that your still paying £80 for the product?<br /><br />

				i think if they have it in dollar amount it would stay the same but if it goes by the btc it would havee to go up. if u list something for 1 btc which equals 100 dollars and tomorrow 1btc equals 120 then the product that cost 1 btc would cost 120. either way it screwed me over, just in the time it took my btcs to tranfer to SR they dropped 6 dollars so it screwed my transaction all up&nbsp; now im short!
