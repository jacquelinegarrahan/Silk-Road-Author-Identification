				Yes I was very sad when JOR announced pulling out of silk road for now... I am hoping PLUR comes through without that connection and we see some stellar reviews and more importantly ones from people who have tryed the JOR MDMA as well.

				any quality mdma in usa now --- <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />it goes up n down -- <br /><br /><br />and of course all the claims of % and pure and all --- <br /><br />I wish domestic vendors would have a lab test done to prove ---- some r even afraid to reagent test for obvious reasons <br /><br /><br /><br />if u could imagine what I have received in the usa ? <br /><br />--some supposedly quality &quot;chemists &quot; seem to be popping up domestic <br /><br /><br />but if everyone in usa keeps going by smell and taste and feel ---&nbsp; &nbsp;instead of science it scares me after working with the real deal for over 15 plus years <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ill post some peps claimin super stuff in usa in hpes someone really tested it --- <br /><br /><br /><br />i want to find a real supply n grab a bulk so i dont search every few months ?? <br /><br />respect all <br /><br /><br />

				after browsing a few vendors for mdma i noticed Plur and Cartel del norte basically have the same picture for their mdma<br /><br />plurs<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3a95de7833<br /><br />cartel<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ae616ce100<br /><br /><br /><br />It&#039;s just an observation though. i know people use pictures from other people but this just makes me curious.<br />

				If we&#039;re talking about any MDMA vendors:<br /><br />I have a friend who had some of the best MDMA he&#039;s ever tried in his life from Insta Grams. Said it was a rock, and the best high he&#039;s ever had. Also, USA domestic if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for. I&#039;ll be ordering it soon.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered multiple times from Symbiosis, who is a pretty steady, reliable source. The first two orders I had were FANTASTIC and the third, I had trouble with the roll staying for a long time. Though, every time I&#039;ve tested it on the reagent, it went straight to black.<br />It&#039;s totally possible that I just rolled too often and was too dehydrated for my roll to be as great. Other people I gave the last order to said it was the best stuff they&#039;d ever had, so it might have just been me.<br /><br />Plur, everyone

				SR without JoR is looking a little hectic in the MDMA world.&nbsp; Has anyone tried PPLLUURR&#039;s mdma?&nbsp; I ordered from JoR for the first time ever, have yet to try it but will at bisco, and then he leaves... Now I need more but who to buy from with good prices and quality stuff?
