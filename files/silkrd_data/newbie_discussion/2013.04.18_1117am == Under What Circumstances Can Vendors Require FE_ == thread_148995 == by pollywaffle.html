				None, they can not require it, they can only ask for it.<br /><br />It is up to the buyer to make the decision to trust or not.<br /><br />Good best not to FE, and if you really are, do it on very SMALL deals,<br />with a bestselling/highest-ranking seller..<br /><br />but still try not too...

				A vendor can only require it once he has 35 positive transactions. Most likely a vendor that is only one month old requiring FE is a scam so watch out.<br />After 35 transactions they can 100% require it, but you can always find a better vendor that doesn&#039;t require it.<br />Chaos

				it depends how your buyer stats look too sometimes, remember scamming goes both ways. The only time I&#039;ve been asked to F.E. (since having a good bit of transactions) for the reasons of me not have been previous customer of the vendor, I got ripped off but it was only like 40 bucks, which is stupid as fuck. But reasons for an F.E. can range from, High priced order seller cannot &quot;risk to risk&quot;, International orders to certain countries, and sometimes even if the vendor cannot afford to keep that amount stocked they must purchase it with your money.&nbsp; But yeah definitely dont ever f.e. for a brand new vendor and just be smart and do your research before you make a purchase. I believe in the forum last scammer i saw was detected within maybe 7 or so people buying from them within just a few days, and since they made me f.e. i only got a tiny bit that i was not the slightest bit worried about, the pics were just tempting hehe.

				Try and avoid it at all costs if you can, a trusted seller scammed loads of people not too long ago by getting everyone to FE. You may have to do it if it&#039;s your very first purchase though.

				I was under the impression that no vendor is supposed to ask for FE. It&#039;s not a hard and fast rule though.<br /><br />I just started buying and only one vendor asked for FE cos I was a brand new buyer. His feedback was great and I risked it cos I was desperate, he came through.<br /><br />I want to buy from some H vendors that require me to have 10 sales or they want FE. Screw that, these are illegal drug deals! I will go off and buy 9 more small amounts from other highly rated vendors, who don&#039;t ask for FE, until I get my hallowed 10 sales then I will go back to the H vendors and job&#039;s a good &#039;un.<br /><br />Unless you are prepared to kiss your money goodbye. NEVER FE. There is no need, there is plenty of choice out there.

				Yeah I thought there were no circumstances where you had to FE and have read others who say to report vendors but anyway whatever.

				I think it&#039;s best not too.&nbsp; Some vendors only like to deal with customers that have successful transactions and will only deal with newbies if they finalize early.&nbsp; Some vendors offer free shipping if you finalize early.&nbsp; But remember, the risk is being shifted to you if you give the money up front and they don&#039;t deliver.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know deadguy scammed a bunch of people selling LSD and there has been a few instances since I&#039;ve joined.&nbsp; Play is safe in the escrow system and with reputable vendors and you should be fine.

				I just placed my first 2 orders.&nbsp; I read and read vendor profiles and seems like 90% make newbies FE.&nbsp; I order ritalin mostly so there are not that many vendors to choose from.&nbsp; I went with a vendor with a long good track record and here&#039;s hoping.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a choice.

				I&#039;m a newb as well, but I have done a good amount of homework and I can tell you there are people out there who will not make you FE if you put in the time and effort and what not. Just placed my first order ever and after contacting the vendor I do not have to FE. I think the key is small quantities as others have mentioned, you might even want to consider contacting the vendor. Couldn&#039;t hurt right? Maybe look for new vendors as well so you have better chances.<br /><br />Basically all I am saying is that if you put in the time and effort, you might be surprised of the results, don&#039;t get lazy or give up! It took me way too long to figure all this stuff out, as I am sure it has most everyone when they started.

				Under absolutely no--positively negative--trivially certain--or otherwise catastrophic circumstances can vendors REQUIRE buyers to FE.<br /><br />FE = Faggot<br /><br />Or if you are LGBT, then FE = Asshole... but I still prefer faggot.
