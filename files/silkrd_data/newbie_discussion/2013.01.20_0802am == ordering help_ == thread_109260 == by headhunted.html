				Now I&#039;m not entirely stupid, but I would like to make sure that I don&#039;t do anything wrong when I do order.<br />I have the ability to encrypt and decrypt for specific sellers, but how exactly do I send my encrypted message to the seller?<br /><br />I&#039;m using the latest version of GPG4win.<br /><br />Is it as simple as putting the encrypted message as well as my public key in the address form on the shopping cart page?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you&#039;re trying to encrypt a message, then you would just encrypt the text, copy it, and paste it in the message box if you&#039;re sending a message, or in the address field for your shipping address.&nbsp; It&#039;s considerate to include your key in the encrypted message, or at least message it to the vendor in case they want to use it.

				Yes, it is that simple.&nbsp; In addition I follow a suggestion made by a vendor some time in the past.&nbsp; I put my plain text public key&nbsp; in the bottom of my plain text file containing my purchase and address info and then encrpyt that file.&nbsp; Then paste the encrypted result in the address window.&nbsp; Also don&#039;t forget to include the vendor&#039;s key in you encrypted text so that can decrypt and read you message.

				Thanks for the help, I just want to reiterate to further make sure that I have it right,<br />in the address field I put my encrypted message ( that also contains my public key) as well as the vendor&#039;s public key ?<br /><br />It seems a little weird that I would need to include their key, I don&#039;t need to enter my key to decrypt files/text that were encrypted for my key.<br />Also, if the vendor needs their key to decrypt the message, wouldn&#039;t it be unwise to include it in the encrypted file? They wouldn&#039;t be able to access it
