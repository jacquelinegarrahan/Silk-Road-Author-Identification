				Aside, from posting spam, the primary thing I&#039;ve been doing in the forums (and on SR, now that it&#039;s back up) is searching for a reputable MDMA dealer that&#039;s better than all the rest. I&#039;m looking for West Coast USA domestic (for quick shipping times) and I&#039;m looking for $70-$100 grams. Does anybody have any recommendations? I&#039;ve been looking at nyan, Aidoneus, Tryptonite, Off The Wagon, and Insta Grams, but I dont know how I can choose between the dealers!

				I&#039;ve ordered from Off The Wagon about 5-6 times and out of those I&#039;ve had three different batches of MDMA from him.&nbsp; Every single batch has been absolutely amazing!!&nbsp; He sends large crystals (everybody claims they do but what you&#039;ll find in the mail is sometimes a different story), his shipping in nice and stealthy and he ships every day (I think... could be wrong about that)... His product is definitely A+ you will not be disappointed with his product at all.&nbsp; He is probably my personal favorite MDMA vender on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve also ordered from instagrams.&nbsp; I ordered a 1g sample from him and then later ordered 10g ... I totally fucked up and put in the wrong address for the 10g&#039;s so I never got it!!&nbsp; I of course finally finalized the order after I did all I could do to retrieve it but it was a big financial loss for me.&nbsp; He was very kind and understanding about it and told me if I were to order from him again he&#039;d throw in a little extra... Well I ordered from him again.&nbsp; I bought 1gram and he kindly sent me 2!!&nbsp; His MDMA is also off the fucking chain.&nbsp; When you open the bag and smell it, it smells like a bag of old school good quality pressed pills (I know you know that smell).&nbsp; The only down side to ordering from instagrams is that if you do the cheapest (maybe its free) shipping he doesn&#039;t do tracking on the package so if something goes wrong (like when my dumb ass put in the wrong address) there&#039;s nothing that can be done about it as far as having the post office reroute the package etc... <br /><br />I&#039;ve also ordered from usatodutchusa or whatever he calls himself.&nbsp; He says he has supertrips MDMA and has a photo of nice crystals.&nbsp; He&#039;s located somewhat near me so I was surprised that a week after my order had been placed I still hadn&#039;t received my product.&nbsp; I was sketched out about this receiving address at my friends because of the debacle that had just happened with the wrong address thing. Long story short we were worried that our shipping address had been compromised.&nbsp; I wrote Usa2Dutch2Usa and told him that the package should have been there by now. I asked him to NOT send it and just cancel my order.&nbsp; Instead 2 days later I get a package from him with the 2grams I ordered plus 2 pressed pills that he threw in (I guess as a way to say sorry)... I was pretty damn upset that he didn&#039;t do as I requested which was to cancel the entire order... That being said the Sand consistency MDMA that he sent was REALLY REALLY good... It tested great and I gave it to a friend who had tried off the wagon&#039;s shit a few times... He said this stuff was alot stronger and better.<br /><br />I would go with Off the Wagon for a more heart felt mellow (maybe mellow isn&#039;t the right word) empathetic roll that will give you a night to remember for the rest of your life.<br /><br />I would go with instagram&#039;s MDMA if you want a slightly more intense experience and want to save a little money.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you go with Instagram or Off The Wagon you WILL NOT be disappointed with either I can promise you that.&nbsp; If you have the money I would go ahead and get a gram from each, or an 8 ball from each (not sure what kind of money you&#039;re working with)... Off The Wagon&#039;s shit was so good, and many of my friends hadn&#039;t rolled in a while so some of them didn&#039;t really know if they wanted to party again.&nbsp; I got it to sell but ended up giving away about 1gram of his MDMA because i wanted my good friends to experience it so badly because it was so fucking good.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I&#039;ve sold both vender&#039;s MDMA i&#039;ve told the buyers that if they have any problems with the product at all they can return whats left for a full refund.&nbsp; When people hear that it makes them buy with confidence.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had one person give me a complaint about either&#039;s MDMA... The only reason somebody would have a problem with their shit, or not enjoy it, is if they are taking antidepressants or even something that effects your serotonin such as tramadol (non narco pain killer)... Start loading up on 5htp because you are going to have a fucking blast!!<br /><br />Off The Wagon&#039;s shit had a little bit more mellow come down... had no problems falling asleep at all.&nbsp; Same with Instagram... They are pretty much neck and neck when it comes to quality. OTW&#039;s looks better than instagram&#039;s... Thats about the only difference. <br /><br /><br />Have fun, order with confidence from either of those two and tell them Bill Paxton sent you! :)<br /><br />-Bill Paxton&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Isn&#039;t 70-100 dollars a bit too expensive??<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought high quality MDMA from reputable sellers in Silk Road for 18 euros per gram.

				Bill Paxton, thank you SO much for your review - that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m looking for. I think you have me sold on both. I&#039;m strapped for cash right now and just looking for personal supply, so I think I&#039;ll try Insta Gram&#039;s stuff.<br /><br />l1llykin&#039;s, did you have experience with either dealer?! I&#039;d love personal encounters and stories like Bill shared.

				So much like you I am also new to the road and made my first purchase very recently.&nbsp; I researched forever for the best prices and best quality and when it came down to it I really wanted to go with the red and grey pills from Aidoneus.&nbsp; His seller rating and reviews are stellar but his prices are a little high compared to other USA domestic vendors (Probably because he/she/they sell preloaded capsules at convince which also caught my attention). <br /><br />&nbsp;I finally figured out the whole bitcoin thing and wanted to make my first MDMA purchase through them and they ran out of stock.&nbsp; I then looked around for a cheaper domestic seller and came across Instagrams.&nbsp; I live right in the middle of the country and it took about 4 days for his package to arrive after paying for the priority 3-5 day shipping.&nbsp; Probably would have shown up faster if we didn&#039;t get 2 feet of snow in the middle of April (Teh fak)? The stealth was OK, very clever but I think could have been sealed better, im no expert.&nbsp; I probably paid about $55 per gram (~185 for his 3.5G listing), it came as some decent sized crystal chunks and it smells great!&nbsp; I wanted it fast so I could use it at a concert with a bunch of close friends, then I got mono&nbsp; :&#039;(, fml.&nbsp; Anyways what I am trying to say was my experience with Instagrams was very pleasant and I had no problems, as far as potency I couldn&#039;t tell you anything besides that it looks and smells great.&nbsp; Cheers!<br /><br />Edit: Also try the Avengers new MDMA review thread that seems to be the newest and coolest<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.0

				Hey, I was looking for quality around 35-50$ per gram Domestic US but, everyone seems to be a tad bit higher in price. (Looking to buy many grams) Does anyone know where to get someone who won&#039;t try and scam and is legit + fast processing?

I&#039;d advise buying 3.5 -- 5.0 grams and selling some to your friends.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in an area where there is NO mdma around then you can easily charge 120.00-150.00 for a gram... If somebody&#039;s other option is to not get any at all then 150.00 is reasonable IMO.&nbsp; I only party about once every 3-6 months and I make it a special occasion when I do.&nbsp; Paying a little extra to guarantee quality is a small price to pay. I&#039;ve planned and executed big party plans with friends/loved ones only to end up with fake/bullshit pills before so I don&#039;t mind the extra price.&nbsp; That being said I always buy 5-10 grams and sell the rest to close friend&#039;s to where I get my 1-2 grams for free.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey guys,<br /><br />Canadian vendor here with relatively fast shipping to US. Right now have pretty small postings but I will be acquiring a large amount of high quality canadian molly in the near future and have listings for larger amounts up as well.<br /><br />I am relatively new but I do have five or six reviews up already. Some people in US received product in 4-6 days. <br /><br />I have some of my current batch left, but not much. It&#039;s posted at pretty cheap prices. <br /><br />Also, I have MDA for sale !<br /><br /><br /><br />TH

				UnderGroundSyndicate is the bomb, I have ordered from him a few times and the orders always come super quick in the US. Also when buying the 10 gram listings the price is under 60/gram. Not to mention the product in simply the bomb.
