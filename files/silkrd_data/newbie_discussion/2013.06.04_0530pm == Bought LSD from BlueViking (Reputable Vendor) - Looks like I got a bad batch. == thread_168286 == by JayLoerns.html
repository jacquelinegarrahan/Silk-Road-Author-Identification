				I&#039;ve been burnt twice for acid so I figured I&#039;ll follow the avengers thread to find someone reputable to get some lucy.....<br /><br />I took 2 hits several days ago....felt weird...nothing significant (vendor claims each blotter has 110-115ug)...so today (about 4 hours ago) I decided to test the remainder.<br /><br />I took 4 hits at noon.<br /><br />Waited till about 2 pm.<br /><br />Took 4 more.<br /><br />After a a couple of hours ...I decided to drive back home after getting bored at the park. As for storage, as soon as it arrived, I put it in an air-tight amber vial -&gt; then put the entire thing in a zip lock bag -&gt; then stored the entire thing in the refrigerator. I used the product in less than 3 weeks.<br /><br />From the avengers thread...looks like BlueViking is a reputable vendor..did I just get a bad batch? Any recourse as far as fixing my bad order?<br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;m guessin you had liquid hits, what where hits measured at?<br /><br />Sounds like bunk to me, if you took 2 hits and did&#039;nt feel anything...<br /><br />Don&#039;t just do 4 cause you don&#039;t feel it&nbsp; :&#039;( be smart man.<br /><br /><br />You need more description on what you received or i cant help you.

				Sorry to hear about your bad experiences.<br /><br />As far as this one goes the only thing you can do (as you must have finalised by now) is contact the vendor.<br /><br />If he&#039;s reasonable he should come to some arrangement with you.<br /><br />Also do as search on the other forums to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with him.<br /><br />The best of luck.

				Honestly dude acid doesn&#039;t work on some people. I know a guy who took 3 hits of the same acid as I did and felt nothing where I took 2 and tripped balls.

				Check the reviews. Are they good?<br /><br />If you have experience with benzos, benzos in your system, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and some other drugs, LSD may not work for you.<br /><br />Heck, LSD may not work for you simply because it just won&#039;t. If you have any of the above drugs in your system, wait until they evacuate--then try again. Good luck.

				I&#039;m inclined to agree, i think maby either acid just doesn&#039;t work for you, maby your body chemistry is such that you would need a high high dose to get a normal effect. Trust me when i say drugs effect everyone different and some people not at all. I remember first time i did coke, snorted a big fat line and didnt and up feeling anything, my friend snorted a big line of same stuff and was pretty high.

These blotters are tested and verified. I have even tested them myself.<br /><br />If you are using benzos, you could have an adverse reaction. If you are using opiates/painkillers, this can also dull the effect. If you are taking anti-depressants or any other SSRI&#039;s, this can also effect your trip. <br /><br />Some people don&#039;t react to LSD, and you might be one of them. But to say you took 4 and felt nothing means that there is something wrong on your end.<br /><br />I personally took 3 of these and had an amazing trip, and my tolerance is pretty high. I have sold over 1000 hits of this acid, and haven&#039;t had one complaint. Another EU vendor sells the same print and also has no problems. <br /><br />Edit: There are a few things wrong with this story that makes me think this is an attempt at tarnishing my reputation. For one, no one has contacted me regarding my product being bad, not even this member. Secondly, the story states that they stored the product safely for three weeks in a freezer. I have only been selling my dolphins for less than two weeks. Something doesn&#039;t add up here.

				I spent the entire last 7 days researching how to and who to buy my first SR purchase from.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard NOTHING but raving reviews about BlueVikings dolphins from everybody on every forum that I am apart of.<br /><br />The reviews speak for themselves.&nbsp; Even as a first time buyer about to buy BV&#039;s blotter, I can even tell that this review is as bunk as they claim their blotter to be.&nbsp; Seriously, who goes through such stringent details of storing a ten strip of acid for a couple weeks?!&nbsp; I used to sell a LOT of blotter back in the day and as long as you have your sheets wrapped in foil and a saran wrap around that in a cool (room temp) place, you&#039;re not going to lose any potency of your blotter.&nbsp; I&#039;ve stored blotter for over a year like this before and had no degradation of the chemical.<br /><br />Maybe if you go back to the park and wait for another 4 hours you might start tripping...&nbsp; &nbsp;:o
