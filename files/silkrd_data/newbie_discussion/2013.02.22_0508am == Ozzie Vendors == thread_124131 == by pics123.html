				Is it harder to get your orders from an Australian vendor? I keep on hearing people say that it&#039;s best to only buy Domestic, but it seems Australian vendors are an exception to this rule, and most Australian buyers solely buy overseas. Why is that?

				because australian prices are 5 times more expensive then OS, so aussies buy OS to get 5 times their money&#039;s worth, unless they are desperate and need something fast.

				I&#039;m not sue if I fully understand your question, there are quite a few very reliable AU domestic vendors who are mostly reselling product bought from o/s on SR. The price buying domestically though is quite high hence why many people order from o/s at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />If you want fast and reliable service avoiding customs and are happy to pay the premium for that service they buy domestic. If you are happy to take your chances with customs and a longer wait then go o/s.<br /><br />I have had very good experiences with Neon Lights, Enter The Matrix, aussieExpress for domestic MDMA if that helps.

				I was actually reading through the Aussie Vendors thread, and I kept on seeing &quot;But I don&#039;t buy from OZ anymore&quot;, was thinking it might be because they got scammed allot or that the actual product was not good enough, glad that isn&#039;t always the case.

				I don&#039;t know what you are talking about. Australian vendors are some of the best in world. *sucking up much ;)* The only issue is the exorbitant prices that we pay local. Many of the top Australian vendors have quality that you can&#039;t find on the streets of oz, making them great alternatives to the dodgy back alley, bullshit talking dealers in RL.<br /><br />The issue with OS vendors especially for newbies is the risk involved that many aren&#039;t prepared for and will invariably spam these boards with once that has been experienced. (myself humbly included). Don&#039;t knock out local SR vendors. Had some of my best transactions with the local oz scene. If they weren&#039;t there you&#039;d be waiting twice as long for your high and &quot;taking jerwbs&quot; away from those hard working Aussies who try to bring some quality into my market.<br /><br />Aussie Aussie Aussie <br />Oi oi oi<br />

				As soon as is practically possible. If you have your product the vendor should have his cash. Only fair and remember without that cash the vendor won&#039;t be able to restock for you when you want that next order ;)<br /><br />Express doesn&#039;t always mean Next Day its in your hands. Just be patient and give items up to a week. Vendors are busy people with many many orders. Plan ahead if possible, placing orders early in the week means you&#039;ll usually have it in 2-3 days.

				Thanks for that! Well he knows the payments sitting there waiting and as I&#039;m new I did as he requested and told him I know I&#039;m new etc and will leave feedback (and finalize payment if required) the day I receive it. Just from our communication I let him know I was hoping he may send it Wed the day I paid but he said he can only send Thurs which I was okay with if it came Fri, unfortunately it didn&#039;t.<br /><br />But yes true, if all goes well and its here Mon atleast I&#039;ve still got an event I need it for, I&#039;ll be a happy man and he&#039;ll have a return customer and positive feedback plus I&#039;ll release the funds the moment I get home.

				Have had nothing but great success with EnterTheMatrix, Neon Lights and PuffinBilly. ETM is apparently MIA at the moment, I must have got in just before this all happened -- same with NL. I received a package from NL Wednesday last week, after it was sent on Tuesday (the day before). ETM was actually same day (I had to FE in the morning before work as it was my first transaction, and it was waiting for me when I got home that afternoon!). PuffinBilly sent his stuff via regular post, but if I remember correctly I ordered on Monday night and received it Friday -- no complaints at all from Aussie vendors. Some people don&#039;t like the price, but I&#039;m not buying often and I&#039;m not buying it to sell/make a profit -- it&#039;s just to treat myself :) Would rather not run the risk and pay that little bit extra and get it via domestic post!

				One thing I&#039;ve noticed on SR street drug prices here Aust Domestic reflect or are sometimes cheaper than the actual price on the street.<br />However prescription prices are ridiculously high, 5 Vals for $35, one dexy for ten bucks,,,,,,seriously??!!!<br /><br />I have also noticed that prescription prices from over seas vendors esp India are a lot higher than if you were to order<br />online normally which has the same legalities anyway, which makes me think people can be based here in Australia, I take your<br />money $100 for 50 Valium then jump on the net and order them to your address on an indian pharm where i pay $50 for the<br />same order. Im relying on an unknown vendor to discreetly package your order.....well I guess if u r too lazy to put the effort in

				Hey folks. Speaking of long-awaited orders (and an increasingly nervous buyer), I&#039;m wondering if anyone&#039;s got news on ShardMinister? He&#039;s been utterly brilliant with all facets of trading since I started dealing with him, but he&#039;s mysteriously gone quiet for nearly 2 weeks now. I&#039;l be forced into an unwanted resolution phase with him in a couple of days, but if anyone&#039;s heard anything lately, let me know, eh? I don&#039;t particularly wanna be another sad SR statistic, but I&#039;m equally worried for him because he seemed kinda cool on many levels, and his washed coke was fucking unreal at last sample.......<br />Mind you, Neon Lights was awfully nice when I first PM&#039;d him too. Lucky I didn&#039;t place an order!<br /><br />[and sorry Shardy - didn&#039;t wanna negatively advertise you, if you do re-appear soon.......]

Noteworthy though is that Auspost is owned by the UN.. kind of anyway, and there are resolutions we and many other countries are signatories to that governs the use of the mail system to transport illicit drugs or precursors. So at the end of the day its completely within reason to say that shit is going to get difficult but .. really... it would need to be &gt;10-15% of the total mail being drugs and such to justify any effort or screening program. targeted though.. well.. again please be specific so as to avoid hysteria...<br /><br />I miss Shard and hope he is ok and the issues that had been building in his RL have been sorted.. its sad but from the evidence and the conversations I have had with him I don&#039;t believe this exit was a planned thing.. well not at the time it happened. He had stated a need to have a break but I don&#039;t believe that the timeframe he had locked in fits with the sudden exit that happened.. <br /><br />any solid info out there please PM me. I may or may not share my info and the solid reasons I have for assuming something drastic has taken place but ... I really have good reasons to believe that to be th case..<br /><br />:-(<br /><br />hope your ok bro and that what is the rarest of rare has happened... that I&#039;m wrong...&nbsp; ;-P<br /><br />

				I suspect that a crackdown at AusPost would still be like looking for needles in a haystack ... SR is not that popular yet !<br />However some vendors need to pay more attention to stealth ... Easy detections only encourage more attention<br /><br />Unfortunately, the more popular the vendor, the more difficult the postage problem becomes ...

I think you have taken a reactive system and given it a preemptive power.. Like it sounds like your saying that because the redirect system does what it does then they must know about all the mail in the system at any given time allowing them to take a letter addressed to one address and direct it to the new address completely bypassing the old address.. this is not how it works .. The letter goes to the local PO and they have the records and they put the yellow sticker on and put it back in the system and so a day or so later than usual that letter arrives at the PO for the new address and is delivered. The point is that Auspost isn&#039;t &#039;aware&#039; of the letter until it is being sorted at the local PO for the mailman to deliver... basically until its in the postcode sorting the only thing that is really read is the postcode... didn&#039;t you Wonder why the little box&#039;s for the postcode are big and offset and have a colour border..... <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking maybe the 2/3 that got opened where from someone to you or you to someone else so that&#039;s how you know of them and that&#039;s also who the other person you would &#039;compromise&#039; by posting... I&#039;m seeing a common thing here about how you came to your conclusion.. I&#039;d clean house and tell your mate to as well and I&#039;d be expecting a visit from the local constabulary real soon man cause its really sounding like maybe you or your mate are &#039;hot&#039; at the moment... watching 2 addressees is not so difficult...<br /><br />be safe man..
