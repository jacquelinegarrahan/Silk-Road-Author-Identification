				The only advice I can give is research the hell out of your vendor and make contact with him first. Work something out if at all possible. My first purchase was with ST and I got caught up in the fiasco in september, I was one of the very few that received their product, after about 30-35 business days and I wouldn&#039;t wish the anxiety and paranoia on my worst enemy. Research is your best friend when FE&#039;ing. Start out small as well.

				FE is fine if you are ok with the possibility of never seeing your currency or a product again.<br />Also there are many non drug related products on SR that can help you build stats, I as a vendor do not require FE or sell illegal products.<br />X)<br />nomad

				I can see why a vendor would require FE after having been scammed once or twice (happens to just about every vendor on here, I&#039;m sure). That said, it&#039;s rare that you can&#039;t find any product elsewhere, from a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE. Maybe you&#039;ll pay more to buy from that vendor, but it can be worth it for peace of mind.<br /><br />If any part of a potential transaction sketches you out, go elsewhere. I sometimes communicate with a vendor just to get a feel for them. Some people are assholes, and that&#039;s alright, I guess. Doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re out to scam you. But I prefer to do business with nice people.

				If you do your research you can usually find some vendors who do not require FE for the product you want.<br /><br />Do it if you want, I wouldn&#039;t do it on anything large, only on personal use items that you can live without if something ever happened and you didn&#039;t receive.<br /><br />Just picture the things you buy with FE as a street deal, it has more inherent risks and you can have the potential to be scammed. So don&#039;t be gambling with amounts you will cry over.

				Like others said, look for a reputable vendor, search for feedback and start off buying small amounts for the first 5-10 transactions. After 5 transactions you should try to avoid FE, if the vendor isn&#039;t trusting enough after that, don&#039;t order from them.

				Just put in my first order and FE&#039;d. So long as it&#039;s from a highly regarded seller I don&#039;t see a problem. As a new user, I think it&#039;s best to buy small and cheap while FE&#039;ing, before you build up enough of a reputation to buy from less-known vendors while not FE&#039;ing.

				You CAN FE, and you probably will have to at some point if you&#039;re a new buyer.<br />Some vendors will give you the benefit of the doubt, but will state in their policy that no refunds.<br />You&#039;ll be fine to FE with a well established vendor.<br />Just keep buying small until your stats are up

				Sometimes you just dont have a choice. Right now I´m in a stupid situation where I had to FE and the package is not showing up...and the vendor seems to be scamming. His last 30 or more reviews are all &quot;FE&quot;.<br /><br />Kinda sucks for 120 USD.<br /><br />Of course, I could get into the forums and discuss about it or at least warn others...oh wait, I cant.

This however is a trusted relationship on both sides so being scammed isn&#039;t a risk, it&#039;s not normally like that so as a general rule still try to use the escrow system, it&#039;s there for good reason.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d say avoid at all cost.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve thoroughly researched your vendor and it seems safe, perhaps. A lot of vendors wont sell while your count is low, especially if it&#039;s a large order!

				I think if a vendor requires FE it&#039;s a fishy situation anyway. As a new buyer you can find many vendors that will not require you to FE.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve never finalized early. And I likely never will unless it&#039;s justified and requested by a vendor for a certain circumstance.

				FE is ok if you don&#039;t have the buyer stats to back yourself up and the seller has a lot of transactions and a high feedback percentage. I have done FE a few times without issues, and I&#039;ve done escrow where I ended up needing to ask for a refund.

				I just received an order from Goldust in which he asked me to FE as I am a new buyer/product had to be shipped overseas.&nbsp; Arrived and 3 days and he(they?) made sure to inform me that any future purchases can now stay in escrow.<br /><br />Basically what I am saying is, if you do your research and are comfortable with a vendor, sometimes you have to take a risk in order to build a working relationship.&nbsp; After all there are inherited risks for both parties.

				I would probably never finalize early.&nbsp; It defeats the whole &quot;escrow&quot; concept and as a vendor I wouldn&#039;t require anyone to finalize early unless they had no purchases.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I might do as vendor is create a custom listing for a new account holder (we&#039;d need to communicate first and see what the stakes were)and do small deals with them and require them to finalize early.&nbsp; They would need to start out slow.&nbsp; This way, neither the seller or buyer can really get screwed.&nbsp;
