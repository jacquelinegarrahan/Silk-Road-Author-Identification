				My experiences have been decent.&nbsp; Just make sure they have + reviews.&nbsp; Most will charge you a 3-10% fee, but if it&#039;s local, it&#039;s the easiest and most anon.

				Just used localbitcoins recently and can&#039;t say enough about it. Just make sure you pick sellers with good feedback. The one I used was prompt and professional. Having the vendor do counterfeit detection in a public spot was unique though.

				I&#039;ve used LBC with 100% success rate.&nbsp; Prefer face to face, but recently had an experience where I walked into a Chase bank and simply deposited the cash to this person&#039;s account and no more than 30 seconds after leaving the bank, got the notification that the bitcoins had been released to my account.&nbsp; Now, I wouldn&#039;t normally have done this but for the 100% feedback on over 70 transactions from this seller.<br /><br />Happy to give you his username if you PM me (no, it&#039;s not me)

I agree, LBC is great.&nbsp; I had good luck with BitInstant&#039;s cash deposit before they went down for their revamp, but given that some people had issues with them, I am likely to continue going to LBC in the future.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a good system set up.

				Worked for me. (Almost) As easy as bitinstant, without having to put any names down. It might be a little awkward at first, but you&#039;ll get the hang of it.

				I&#039;ve used localbitcoins a few times. It is very easy. For me, it was weird at first because it felt sort of like a drug deal in the middle of a coffee shop, but I handed him cash, he sent me coins, and it was done. I tried a different guy this time; he was more chill.<br /><br />I like localbitcoins more than bitinstant now. I&#039;ll probably use bitinstant (if they ever come back) again if I need coins really quickly, but I like supporting my local btc community.

				I&#039;ve heard some say yes and some say no. I don&#039;t think transactions can be decrypted to find out where it&#039;s being sent to. But someone might be able to correct me on this.

				I&#039;ve had only positive experiences with LBC, just make sure to read up on the relevant information and choose a vendor with good feedback. In fact, I&#039;ve even bought coins at below MtGox prices on there before. If you&#039;re only dealing in small amounts, an online bank transfer should be fine to do, bitcoins aren&#039;t illegal and it&#039;s much riskier for the vendor unless they have a legitimate business account and pay taxes on their profits. However, for better security, a cash deposit at a bank or at a face to face meet would be preferable.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

Traceability from BTC comes from the coins themselves and not your IP, so whether you made the direct transfer from your IP or through Tor is somewhat irrelevant. I would recommend tumbling your coins with a service like BitcoinFog, it takes a 1-3% of the total for the services but it is worth it for the added security.<br /><br />Theoretically, it&#039;s possible for LEO to set up an OTC BTC service, take cash deposits, follow the coins to see if they end up at an SR address, then possibly confront you about it next time you purchase from them.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
