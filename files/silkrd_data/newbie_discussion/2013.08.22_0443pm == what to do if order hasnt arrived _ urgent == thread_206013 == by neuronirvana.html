				Hi ,<br /><br />I ordered quite a lot for my second order , as I was warned to be careful, despite vendors great feedback I have not finalized early to be extra cautious.I ordered an express delivery and its been over a week now. My money are in escrow. what to do if you think it is a scam or how to resolve the case to get your money back :(<br />I send a message to the vendor and no response. the parcel meant to be tracked.... can anyone advice me? would appreciate a lot...

				if you click on orders you will see next to finalize it will say resolve. it doesn&#039;t turn into a link till a certain amount of time has passed tho. i dunno how long tho coz i&#039;ve never needed it. hope it works out for you tho, it could still be the mail being slow or the seller was just caught up and not able to send straight away tho.

				I asked for the number but just got a response that it was shipped thats all. hope that after ordering express delivery- i can at least get 100% money back as it can be checked that I didint get a package.<br />I checked already that resolve button shows up after 11 days or so... do hopefully I can still be safe :) thanks for all responses

If it goes to resolution I think you should get a full refund if the vendor can&#039;t provide proof of delivery. Was the package marked in transit right away? If so, most likely vendor marked it shipped a while before shipping, its bad form but they do it sometimes. Not being responsive or giving you the tracking number is pretty bad service as well, but I don&#039;t think he would try to scam you without FE and with tracked express. Good luck!

				thanks a lot budy :)) yes he is not responsive at all. I understand his busy time but what about not telling people that you wont be able to ship on time? it was marked in transit on my account.He never replied regarding the tracking number. For me personally being 5 star vendor it is just a joke . I have my money stucked and I was unable to order from someone else...hope the resolution centre will help
