				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I would just like to announce our grand opening. We deal with only HIGH QUALITY Black Tar Heroin. The kind you can smoke a point and nod into oblivion. <br /><br />We will be present on the forums, and would love to hear feedback.<br /><br />We think we may send out extremely cheap samples to regular buyers, so our product can stand trail against the best on SR.<br /><br />Check out our vendor page @ http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/566d48935c <br /><br />Drop us a line either on SR or the forums.<br /><br />Happy to be here,<br />Mister McFeely&#039;s Speedy Delivery

				i&#039;d love a cheap sample but i get the feeling i&#039;m not &quot;old school&quot; enough to qualify. heh. i may well try out a bit, though.. i&#039;m trying to get a feel for the best dope vendors on the road for regular business. will you be adding a &#039;priority shipping&#039; option anytime soon?

				Welcome to the road&nbsp; Mister Mcfeely and +1 on the positive side man. The link to my thread is in my sig below. All I need to promote you and your products is a review from an established member of your choice and then I can feature your name and products in the title of my thread. As you will come to see I keep that thread bumped to the front page in order to give good vendors as much exposure as possible. I created that thread to help buyers find good vendors for the stuff they want and to help good vendors to gain more buyers. PM me if you are interested

If we&#039;ve already made contact with you, don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll get the sample. As for everyone else, we&#039;re very sorry but this is the cut-off.

				We&#039;ve had our first successful transaction!<br /><br />Thank you for lending us your trust and &quot;going out on a limb&quot;. <br /><br />As our samples and orders begin to hit next week, our feedback should grow, and the quality of the product should begin to be known.<br /><br />We&#039;ve also upgraded our stealth. It costs us a little extra, but that doesn&#039;t effect you, because as always, our shipping is FREE.<br /><br />If there are any full members viewing this thread, do us a favor and let people know we&#039;re in business. Our goal is to reach the 50 post mark without spamming or posting any unnecessary comments. (We&#039;ll see how long that lasts :D ) <br /><br />Anyways, just wanted to spread our joy around as we tape our first bitcoin to the wall.<br /><br />Mister McFeely

				You raise a good point, pacolipps!<br /><br />The distinction between BTH and gunpowder is cloudy sometimes. <br /><br />But this is in fact tar. It just comes in chunks and powder. We have found there to be no difference between the two. In the samples We send you two gentlepeople, we cut up a 2 gram boulder and added the powder to the bags to make them a nice mixture.<br /><br />Also, you guys will be receiving the packages in the upgraded stealth. Please let us know if the packaging is acceptable, and any feedback on that would be nice.<br /><br />Thanks!!!<br /><br />Mister McFeely

				are you saying you gave us like a gram sample??? is this going to be enough for me to give some out to others to get a good opinion of it?<br />if so you will be the first, most samples i get are about a point and it makes it hard to give a good review as most of us use more than that in one sitting and I share with my wife and some friends that we sometimes supply<br />but whatever you sent, I am excited to receive as I just have a feeling this is going to be some fire, just as I said in my first post......I usually think the worst and worry about trying new stuff....but there is something about these guys that just stand out and has me waiting by the mail box for this one!!!

				Whooooa, we should have been more clear :)<br /><br /><br /><br />That was split in between quite a few people.

				FIRST REVIEWS ARE IN:<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2484.msg1128784#msg1128784<br /><br />&quot;Communication: (5/5):&nbsp; Was good and friendly , we didn&#039;t need to talk about much , but they seemed like a pleasant person to deal with right away.<br /><br />Shipping: (5/5) It arrived surprisingly fast for first class. The packaging was very discreet , and happened to work perfectly for my situation. Stealth was good enough, no seeing or feeling thru the envelope which is good(vs.a benzo order i just got that was terrible). but apon prying eyes im not sure how it would have held up.&nbsp; but It sounds like i got the last round of packages before they updated they stealth on monday , so that&#039;s a plus.<br /><br />Quality: (5/5) Product seems very good so far!. I&#039;m not sure the weight , but it looked to be an exact point. It came as a dry powdery consistency , much akin to the &quot;gunpowder&quot; people have been selling lately.&nbsp; But tiz just good ol BTH powderyness . . It was much better than say , Einsteins gunpowder i got awhile ago.&nbsp; with this stuff , i started my day a bit dope sick , which i was planning on being , i usually go about a week . then come off to reset my tolerance . but. anyway . i couldn&#039;t believe it was in my mailbox today so fast with first class mail!&nbsp; a true god send i tell ya !<br />first shot i did was probably about half the point . .got a nice warm rush ! my eyes pinned up instantly and it carried me with a good energy well through out the whole day! I did another bump after dinner , and after eating a benzo , which mixed together to give me a wonderful evening nod&nbsp; :)&nbsp; . I was going to save the rest for tomorrow . but , i may just finish off the tiny bit i have left and stay up late enjoying my high .&quot;<br /><br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2484.msg1127375#msg1127375<br /><br />&quot;well i got my sample from MisterMcFeely and let me say this stuff is POTENT!!&nbsp; &nbsp;i put maybe less than a quarter of the point i received and let me tell you it got me and a buddy a REAL GOOD BUZZ he even started to nod. we both have medium tolerances. This shit burns for dayssss. im very impressed with his tar FOR SURE i will definitely be buying from him in the future. was West coast to east coast in 3 days. &quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />As you can see, people with tolerances are getting high all day off ONE POINT. Two people got high off of ONE POINT. <br /><br />From now on, the bags are heavier, the stealth is better, and THE GEAR IS GOOD. The word is in!<br /><br />McFeels

Nice amber colored flakes that run like Forrest Gump. Gotta get some more btc&#039;s and will be back for atleast a gram. Thanks Mister McFeely!&nbsp; ;)

				Thanks for the awesome review, OLD :)<br /><br /><br />Here is another review from yet another awesome SR member:<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2484.18180<br /><br /><br />&quot;Now that I can function again, I can post my full review of MrMcFeely and his amazing tar.&nbsp; I was planning on writing this last night, but after smoking 200mg, I lost my ability to speak English.<br /><br /><br />Customer Service/Communication: 10/10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my 1.5 years on the road, I have never dealt with a vendor as good as MrMcFeely.&nbsp; He responded to every single one of my messages, usually within an hour or two.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t even complain when I asked him to decrypt my address and send it back to me encrypted with my public key.&nbsp; I have to do this because I&#039;ve had a vendor claim I gave them the him the wrong address, when I&#039;m 99% sure I didn&#039;t. <br /><br />He had no problem putting up a custom listing for me for .43 btc (this was before he had a quarter gram listing).&nbsp; I asked him for a quarter gram, and he gave me a whole 310mg. <br /><br /><br /><br />Shipping/Stealth: 9.9/10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered Tuesday evening, and according to MMF, my package was in the mail by 6 AM Wednesday.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t come until Monday, which is a bit longer than usual, even for first class, but I blame USPS.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing MisterMcFeely could have done to make it come any faster.&nbsp; Only not a 10/10 because priority or express weren&#039;t offered, but from the sound of things, it looks like he&#039;ll be offering faster shipping shortly.&nbsp; Stealth was great.&nbsp; Not the absolute best I&#039;ve ever seen, but definitely more than adequate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Quality: 10/10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holy shit is this good tar.&nbsp; By far the best I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; Even stronger than any #4 I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had Nod&#039;s tar, but considering it&#039;s over twice the cost, and I highly doubt it would even be possible to be twice as strong as MsterMcFeely&#039;s tar, I have to say that this tar is definitely the best deal on The Road. <br /><br />I prefer to smoke my h, and holy fuck does this tar smoke great.&nbsp; It smells a bit like vinegar, but there is absolutely no vinegar burn like Seneca&#039;s shitty tar.&nbsp; It smokes so smoothly, so it&#039;s very easy to take huge hits.&nbsp; It was definitely more of a gunpowder consistency.&nbsp; I suspect this is because my order was so small.&nbsp; I&#039;d hope that if I got a gram it&#039;d be more rock and less powder. <br /><br />Now I don&#039;t have much of a tolerance, so take this with a grain of salt, but I absolutely started feeling effects after smoking 15mg.&nbsp; I was nodding pretty good by 100mg.&nbsp; I was able to smoke 250mg over the course of 8 hours.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t advise this because I was so fucking high I went for what was going to be a short walk, and when I returned over an hour later, I had no idea where I had gone, or where my shirt was.&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br /><br />Overall: 100/100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As long as MisterMcFeely is on the road, I will never buy heroin from another vendor.&nbsp; This was by far the best experience I&#039;ve had throughout my entire time on The Silk Road.&nbsp; If you like heroin, you&#039;ll love MisterMcFeely.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Also, we have a new batch!

				MisterMcfeely is the shit&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I guess he had some issues with postage on a few packages, but it seems to all be sorted out now, and he&#039;s top notch<br /><br />Shipping: Shipped next day. I ordered before he was offering Priority, so it came in 4 days including Sunday, which still isn&#039;t bad at all. Packaging is fine, the stealth isn&#039;t anything amazing, but it&#039;s more than adequate for small amounts domestic. The packaging looks very professional outside. Double vacuum sealed. Had some issues with the product sticking to the packaging, but that will pretty much happen no matter what it&#039;s packaged in and can&#039;t be avoided. A few minutes in the freezer fixes it just fine.<br />Communication: Awesome. I usually don&#039;t need any communication with a vendor, but Mcfeely responds very quickly and efficiently. Nice and polite, seems like a cool guy, but very professional as well.<br />Product: Excellent. I have a massive tolerance, but this does the job just fine. Looks great, smells strongly of vinegar, and smokes very well. Good tar taste and runs great, clean trails. And for the price, it&#039;s an especially great deal. You really have to wonder, why would you spend 300/g? You have a product here that&#039;s half the price, and comparable to the best tar on The Road. Just as good if not better.<br /><br />Now that he has got all his issues sorted out, and is offering Priority, it doesn&#039;t get much better. If the product stays consistent and the prices stay competitive and reasonable, he&#039;s going straight to the top.

And he was very quick to respond and apologize and reship. He&#039;s answered all of my messages very quickly and efficiently and politely. I&#039;m betting your order was one of those without the proper postage... So now it&#039;s lost. If you can get a hold of him I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll reship/refund you. Either way, I wish you luck.

				i ordered over the weekend, received the product wednesday, and i am very, very pleased. all communications with MrMcFeely have been prompt and pleasant.&nbsp; the stealth was decent, packaging not bad, double vac-sealed, and the product itself? AWESOME. this tar ran so fast down the foil i almost lost the first chunk i chased; it smokes beautifully. perhaps the best tar i&#039;ve gotten so far on SR, or the other underground markets for that matter.. (though i certainly can&#039;t say i&#039;ve tried them all, i still have a couple on my list-to-try) and MrMcF has a great price for SR. i live near mexico so i&#039;ve seen my share of tar, and MrMcFeely has made me one happy, high customer. not to mention, i could see before even weighing that he gave me some extra. thank you very much good sir! i&#039;ll surely be back for more.

				I should add that MMF&#039;s dope is probably the best deal for heroin on the Road.&nbsp; $150/gram and it is as good as anyone&#039;s.&nbsp; Plus MMF is a personable fellow.&nbsp; I&#039;ve enjoyed corresponding with him.&nbsp; Keep up the good work MMF!

				Does anyone know what is up with Mister McFeely?&nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered last week, then the order was cancelled with the suggestion that I could reorder and packages would go out on Monday, so I ordered again and then MMF didn&#039;t show up on Monday, hadn&#039;t answered a message and hadn&#039;t put orders in transit.&nbsp; He usually is quite communicative about what is going on on his end.&nbsp; Now I see that he has taken down his listings.&nbsp; Perhaps some personal life issue?

				you know i was never disrespectful in anyway, nor was i unprofessional....and i very patiently waited for that sample that never arrived<br />then you tried to make it out like i was lying and I left you good feedback, but here you see more people that did not receive their order so you made the mistake, not me, nor any of us...and for you to come on here and try to say I am the bad guy, or anyone else...that is just wrong and you are only making yourself look bad...even if it was just a sample, you promised us these samples and there are quite a few people that have posted here and in your review that they either did not receive or had some other shipping issues, so me as a potential customer who spends a whole lot on silk road and has had over 30 successful orders in the last few months with no issues, who also gave you every chance to honor your commitment and was very patient with you ...has never received my sample and you got really ugly with me the last messages and now at this point, if you cant honor a simple sample commitment, why would i commit to a larger order ...why would you then on top of all begin to slander me and make me out to be some jerk when i have been as nice as i can be to you and my intentions were only to try out your product that you offered to me and if I would have received it and it was good, then I would be a loyal customer whom you would make thousands of dollars a month off of....its your loss, not mine...there are plenty of excellent vendors here on silk road that can get my orders to me on time, every time...matter of fact, you are the first vendor that could not deliver out of 33 successful orders and 5 successful samples received&nbsp; and I never once even made that public until you sent me a message calling yourself mcfuck and acting like i was a problem because i was messaging you letting you know i never received either of 2 samples you supposedly sent out
