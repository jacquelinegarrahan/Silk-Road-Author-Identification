				I have only recently started using Silk Road and would like to give my vendor some feedback on the forum. I have searched the forum for an answer to this question but haven&#039;t found it. <br /><br />I would like to know why i can only comment in this section &quot;newbie discussion&quot; of the Silk Road forums? I&#039;m sure I can&#039;t be the only person to ask this so i apologize in advance for not being able to find an answer.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.

				Was almost gonna make fun of you untill i read that there is this new rule.<br />Oh well ,if it improves the quality i&#039;ll just have to post more often to be able to get back to usual use of the forum.<br /><br />I don&#039;t intend to buy if i can&#039;t post my review so i better hurry up:).<br /><br />The last posting from your IP was less than 0 seconds ago. Please try again later.<br /><br />This however is just stupid imo.

				It&#039;s kind of a lame concept but what can you do with the crazy influx of spammers and bots.&nbsp; Ideally the system would be based on the quality of information you&#039;re able to provide, not the quantity of bullshit that you can spew on a message board.&nbsp; Often times I will read many posts but only contribute if I really have something to say.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s why I only have 44 posts.&nbsp; Anyway, before all this madness I compiled an amazing list of things to do while tripping.&nbsp; Please share this with the world and PM me if I&#039;ve left anything off eh?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=80623.msg701418#msg701418

				I&#039;ve been a member of forums where there was a similar requirement to post in certain sections, but it&#039;s usually like 10 posts or something like that.&nbsp; I get why DPR had to do it, and it had to be done.&nbsp; I just sucks, because now I can&#039;t contribute when I see a topic that I may have some useful information about.&nbsp;

				Posting anywhere but the newbie section before reaching fifty posts is like yelling fire in a crowded theater; despite the great freedoms of the Darknet, even here our freedom of speech can be curtailed.

				thanks for creating this thread. it stood out the most from my search query and answered what i was looking for. did not realize they implemented this new rule. i just wish they had put the newbie restriction on making NEW threads, not replies -_-
