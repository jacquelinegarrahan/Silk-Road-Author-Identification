				Kind of a long story, sorry. <br /><br />A little background: I can usually find all the products I need locally but sometimes there are supply problems. I&#039;ve only made one other order but everything went smooth. It was great!<br /><br />On a Thursday 12 days ago I placed a small order for around a hundred bucks. I paid for 1 day shipping but the Vendor says he has to go to the pharm and wont be able to ship it out until Saturday. I tell him just to get it as soon as he could because I didn&#039;t want to get sick. He assures me its no problem and I will have it Saturday. <br /><br />Saturday: I looked out the window all day and felt my heart drop when the mail man passed my house. I sent the Vendor a message &quot;Man I wish you could let me know whats up. Mail just came by with nothing. what a let down.&quot;&nbsp; No response. <br /><br />Monday: This is during the DOS but I can get in occasionally and I see the Vendor has logged in that day. I asked Him &quot;Are you MIA, Should I cancel? Whats goin on, Im not doing good.&quot;&nbsp; No response. <br /><br />Wednesday: I cancel the order, I feel bad about it but it was supposed to be here Saturday and he hasn&#039;t sent any messages.&nbsp; Later that day I get a message. That the vendor had family issues and couldn&#039;t log onto his account. But asks for my address because he wants to overnight me something.&nbsp; He also updates his vendor page to say &quot;If you do want to cancel, send me a message with your shipping info and what your order was for and I&#039;ll send you a little something anyways just as an apology for the lackluster service.&quot;&nbsp; I send my info via Privnote, and a few min later I decide since he said he&#039;ll hook up the order I&quot;ll put the order back in. <br /><br />Friday: I can see he hasn&#039;t read the Privnote and No response from my message about the order. <br /><br />Sunday: I ask if he can at least read my address message… anything?.. No response. <br /><br />Today: I can see he has updated his page with the product. I send, &quot;I never thought it would take this long. Can you give me an estimate of when it might be?&quot; <br />Thirty min later… YES! I Have a message!!! When the page loads I see… From: Do not reply &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Order canceled<br /><br />I feel like fucking idiot with Twenty dollars less than when I started. <br /><br />What did I do? Thanks for any replies.

				Just guessing.<br /><br />But if I had a first time buyer order, cancel, then message me a lot, then reorder without telling me, all regarding small quantities, I&#039;d put him in the &quot;high maintenance&quot; or &quot;too risky&quot; pile

				Yeah, I know what you mean... I was really trying not to message him and be a pain in the ass. But how long do I wait after he says it will be there and he never sent any reason or message or anything. Right after I canceled I read his Vendor page asking for people not to cancel. So yeah I will just take the free drugs next time (if there are any).

				You should have taken it easy. You should have ordered from another vendor to back yourself up without pissing off a vendor.

				If this weren&#039;t Silkroad, I&#039;d guess that you were some clingy girlfriend and he&#039;s some jack off asshole. <br /><br />Haha, don&#039;t take it personally.

				it may be because you used privnote, that service is generally considered unsecure and you should try to use pgp instead. I know some vendors will cancel or refuse to work with someone if they use privnote.

But hell its my ass on the line with the address. I figured using that service I could at least see when the note was read. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m much more likely to get pulled over and busted than the Feds tracking me down for a couple pills. Hell maybe I will only PGP from now on.
