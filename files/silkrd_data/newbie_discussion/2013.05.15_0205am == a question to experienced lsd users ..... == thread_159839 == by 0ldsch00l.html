				Hello everybody, i would like to know what you think about my Question. <br />I take lsd since more than 20 years. In the beginning i have had that luck to get very good trips. Most of them i think where solid William Leonard Pickard Quality, for Example : Double sided Bart Simpson, Spirals, First Miraculix 200, Chicken , Pinguins, Buddhas ect. . But 2 times i got luckier and found round purple and black microdots so small to see , but wow an amazing experience. <br />In the last years i often be disappointed about &quot;today&quot; stuff. Many older Fakes (DoX) and Newer ones (Nbome) and in addition that what i call bad lsd. <br />the good one is the light: colorfull, absolutly clear in mind, strong halluzinations, stronger warm happy feelings than from any mdX , awesome thinking, ect.<br />the bad one is the dark: mystically, not colorfull, more ore less confused no clarity, cold, ect. <br /><br />in the first you feel the love , in the second not (so much ;-) )<br />the last blotter where i felt this love where the alex grey st. alberts , and this nice yellow one : http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=lsd/lsd_blotter_hofmann_100th.jpg<br /><br />today i try to orientate me on this blotter ( they had nice paper and the &quot;big&quot; squares, not the &quot;standard&quot; small ones). some dalai lamas where not bad to , but not so brilliant. <br /><br />Could somebody tell me if i could get such good quality actual on silk road ?&nbsp; Please note : From 100 microgramm of finest clear stuff u get heavy halluzinations and color explosions as a first time user.&nbsp; If i try blotter today and hear the micrograms they should have and compare them with the feeling i would split them through 4 , myabe it has to do with the enantiomeres who knows .... ;-)<br /><br />Where could i buy lsd best on silkroad as a first time user , regarding the highest quality ? And where did the lovely family big square blotter go ? I Cant Post in the LSD Avengers Thread and Hope somobody could help me out. Thanks. And excuse my bad english please xD<br />P.L.U.R<br />0ldsch00l

				There are so many GREAT LSD vendors right now on SR.<br /><br />To name a few, JesusOfRave, 3Jane, JerseyCow, and Tessalated..that have listings at the moment. <br /><br />Also theres lots of others that have real good quality LSD available right now. You need to check out the LSD Avengers threads OP.

				Thank You for your Reply !<br />I checked the vendors you spoke from, and i checked also the avengers thread, but i didn´t find stories from experienced users who tried different vendors stuff and matched it with &quot;old&quot; style lsd. <br /><br />Hope someone (maybe a vendor?) could help out ...&nbsp; :)

				I would suggest Jesusofrave&#039;s liquid.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get shit for visuals on 100 mics.&nbsp; Maybe I fried my receptors on stronger hallucinogens.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always thought that was just newbies saying things like that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve given LSD to newbies who say the shit was so strong but it never is for me or my friends who have tripped on high doses of much stronger psychedelics. <br /><br />I want to hear from someone who has taken strong doses of hallucinogens like 50mg or more of one of the strong 2C-x chemicals to tell me if they actually get visuals on 100 mics of LSD?

				I&#039;m currently waiting for my package of 100 hofmann tabs from Jesusofrave(JOR). I also tried Tess&#039;s lsd and it was a very clean trip. Can&#039;t go wrong with a star rated vendor from the Avengers.

				Subtickle sold me great stuff, but think he&#039;s out of stock at the moment.<br /><br />Probably 32 years since I first took acid, only with the wonder that is SR have I gotten hold of it again recently. I think as you get older and if you have some experience with acid, I think you get less visuals. I reckon your brain has gradually learned that the visual distortions are &#039;artificial&#039; and sort of ignores the visuals a bit. Still blows your mind, tho.<br /><br />Take care

				Hi<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159839.msg1129814#msg1129814">Quote from: 0ldsch00l on May 15, 2013, 10:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ok Thanks, <br />I have Stella, Indica, Jor, Mahakala, Alaska, and Fart Bomber for selection. Which one would you chose, as a first time member ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had the same question as you, and I did choose Stella. The few reports seem to tell that s/he is honest, and that her/his stuff is pretty good quality. It might be wise to wait for more reports, but even if it&#039;s not needlepoint as advertised, it sounds pretty pure.<br /><br />Edit: one of those comments was a fake, ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151545.msg1130908#msg1130908 ) might be worth waiting a bit..<br /><br />My second choice would have been Tess, as there are so many great trip reports around (even tho you don&#039;t mention him in your list :p) and third Indica but that&#039;s expensive if we consider that it might be the same quality as what Stella is selling.<br /><br />JoR liquid is probably quite good, even if a couple people in the Avengers thread say that it&#039;s not the purest they ever had. I&#039;ve read that he did reduce the price on his swiss mayas, might be worth checking out - but if Stella&#039;s are really 300ug/tab and great quality then.. ;)<br /><br />If you are not in a hurry you might want to wait a few days to see what come up from the reports, if you are in a hurry well, from your list, I feel like the quality will be quite good, whoever you choose - I&#039;d have gotten stuff from Tess if I didn&#039;t choose Stella&#039;s tabs personnaly but again, that&#039;s from my own research/feelings, I didn&#039;t try those products yet, just read the forums :)<br /><br />The Avengers thread is great, I recommend to read it if you are interested in L, some great reports from those who know what &quot;old style LSD&quot; as you call it feels like, and a few great posts about purity, and great batches from the 90&#039;s.<br /><br />Good luck - I wish you a nice trip whichever acid you choose :)<br />

				for your first time purchase i would go with JesusofRave. <br /><br />I bought 100 tabs from JOR for my first purchase on SR. He will never ask a first time buyer to FE. Awesome customer service too.
