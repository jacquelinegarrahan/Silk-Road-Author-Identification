				Damn,&nbsp; yeah sounds bunk.&nbsp; You should have blasted off after that second hit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a sore throat after hitting the deemsterz.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t vape either.&nbsp; I smoked it on top of a bowl,&nbsp; and it was amazing!

				Well its from a well loved source...I don&#039;t want to say any names yet till I get my real vape in or try it out in a bong, cause like I said I don&#039;t want to say his stuff is bunk in case its my fault. I just thought even if I did do something wrong I would of got some type of visuals at least or something.<br /><br />Oh, but there was one hit, I only could hold in for like 2 seconds...i bet that was the great one,but damn that smoke is fucking harsh.

				I don&#039;t know about the quality of your DMT ... but 20mg is too little unless it&#039;s really pure.&nbsp; Also: you can&#039;t try again immediately ... that doesn&#039;t even work with pure DMT (I&#039;ve tried).&nbsp; They say you need to give it at least 30 minutes, but I always wait at least 2--3 hours in between.<br /><br />EDIT: Check out pimpit for some great Dmitri (or if you prefer see my thread first: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=127219.0).&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t have to take 5 hits or anything like.&nbsp; Good DMT transports you beyond your imaginings&nbsp; in 1 hit.

I got a slight buzzing in the back of my head and then nothing. That was with 50mg. Third time I tried, and wow, it was amazing. Its all about getting your method for smoking it dialed. I recommend a bubbler or small bong. Get some screens and put a few layer on the bottom of the bowl so that when it turns to liquid it doesn&#039;t run down into the bowl. Then put a dose on top(40-50 mg is the recommended dose if you wanna break through) and put another screen on top. Light it so that the flame never touches the DMT. Inhale slowly and hold your breath as long as possible. Take as many hits as you can before you literally can&#039;t anymore. Have someone with you so you don&#039;t drop the piece and get dmt bongwater all over you, ha. <br /><br />If your meant to break through, you will. DMT has a mind of its own.<br /><br />Love and Light

				I have been smoking DMT for about 10years. Crystals of various quality and Changa as well. <br /><br />I have often gotten a sore throat from DMT vapour, it is not unusual. If you are smoking red waxy stuff then you will need 50-100mg you need to smoke it all. If you are smoking white diamond crystals then you should only need 30mg to 50mg. <br /><br />Try it on an inert herb like marshmallow if the glass pipe is too harsh<br /><br />~From the heartland of DMT
