				I&#039;ve been a member of SR for 8 months and, aside from a couple of bad experiences with the minority of unscrupulous vendors, I&#039;ve made many good purchases and enjoyed my time on this marvellous marketplace.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to open a vendor account dealing primarily in prescription Opioids including:<br />OxyContin OC 40mg &amp; 80mg<br />OxyNorm IR 10mg &amp; 20mg<br />Dilaudid (IR Hydromorphone) 4mg &amp; 8mg<br /><br /><br />And, for the first time I&#039;ve seen domestically;<br />Opana ER 40mg - the king of opioids.<br /><br /><br />As I&#039;m sure as many of you know, the prices of these domestically are ridiculous, and not much better from O/S vendors. I&#039;m going to offer more reasonable listings.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d like to gauge the interest in these products from fellow Australians on the Road. Please let me know if you are interested, and as an incentive I&#039;ll offer the first five to respond a 25% discount on their first purchases. <br /><br /><br />My account will be open in 6 days so I can confirm stock numbers and prices.<br /><br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi OzyCodone welcome to the road, I think you&#039;ll have no troubles whatsoever with that product range. I&#039;d say anything close to $1\1mg for OC will sell like hot cakes. Not too sure on the Dilaudid and Opana as I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve seen them listed locally before, but our opiate pharma prices seem to be pretty closely linked with US prices, if not cheaper. <br /><br />I can&#039;t recall if Opana ER is the older formula or the newer ones that are rock hard, and may I ask if they&#039;re imported or locally sourced? I just wasn&#039;t aware they were prescribed in Australia.

				Yep, it seems the standard US price for the OC&#039;s is $1/mg. The OC&#039;s and dillies are from Aus (Mundipharma). The Opana ER 40&#039;s are from the US (Endo)- they&#039;re not available here in Oz and therefore quite rare.<br /><br />I&#039;ve worked out some prices to start with and get the business going. The prices are cheaper than any I&#039;ve seen domestically in Aus on SR.<br /><br />OxyContin 40mg = US $45<br />OxyContin 80mg = US $80<br />Dilaudid 4mg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = US $25<br />Dilaudid 8mg.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= US $40<br />Opana ER 40mg. = US $90
