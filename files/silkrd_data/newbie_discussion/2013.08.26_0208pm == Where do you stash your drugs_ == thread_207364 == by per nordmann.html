				I&#039;m thinking about getting some larger quantity of drugs, but I&#039;m not sure how I should store them? Should I find a place off my property? That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking at the moment, but what if they got stolen lol

				When I used to sell-large qtys were ALWAYS kept stored away from my property. In a sealed container away from prying eyes. Generally a rural location.

				in plain sight with a big sign saying &quot;this is not what you think it is&quot;<br /><br /><br />nahhh.. this is the fun bit. now off you go and have some fun stashing... just think about the elements and make sure its well sealed and in a temperature stable environment.<br /><br />oh, and be sure to tell me exactly where you stashed it....<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Just take into account the probability of anyone finding it or seeing you retrieve/storing your stash. Once you do that you can find some pretty amazing locations. Just always keep your head on straight, don&#039;t decide one day when you&#039;re fucked up that it&#039;d be OK to just throw it somewhere obvious.

				Reminds me of the time a daft bloke I knew temporarily hid a large stash of crack under a rock in some woods... it was only for half a day, but when he got back this massive block of crack was half way down a dead rat&#039;s throat.

				Hey. If you have a car or something you can buy stash speakers. Look on the road. There is many stash things on there.<br /><br />

				My stashing depends on what was being stashed. Certain things react differently to the elements, and need to be taken care of accordingly. Generally your own home is a bad idea if you&#039;re stashing enough to traffic. Personal use amounts probably aren&#039;t too bad.
