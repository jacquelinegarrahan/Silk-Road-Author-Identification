				Ok, firstly what the hell is going on with me only being able to post in the Newbie area?!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a member of SR for a long time and am close to $10K in purchases.&nbsp; ALL successful purchases (except for what I am going to post here).&nbsp; I have also been a member of the forums for quite a while - but never post much since I don&#039;t have anything to say.&nbsp; So why can&#039;t I post this in the Scam section like I&#039;d planned?&nbsp; Not impressed admins.&nbsp; Get a better system sorted.&nbsp; Even some kind of ticket system so once someone buys X amount on SR then they get normal access to forums?<br /><br />Anyway, my question is, is FollowMe legit or has he/she done a runner after building a great rep?&nbsp; I ask because I made my very first ever FE transaction with FollowMe based on the 100% feedback rating, on 1st May.&nbsp; To date the order hasn&#039;t arrived.&nbsp; I PM&#039;d about 8 days ago and no response and I see he/she has &quot;no active listings&quot; for quite some time.<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d put this out there in case other people have had issues but haven&#039;t posted anything.&nbsp; I would love to be &quot;put at ease&quot; by FollowMe.<br /><br />P.s. Admins, please sort out this posting bs.&nbsp; Or if you keep it then replicate the important topics (such as scammers) in the Newbie section.&nbsp; I would think that for such an important topic you would want good data, yes?
