				I came from pure curiosity. I&#039;m just as interested in the idea of Tor, Silkroad and Bitcoins as the drugs offered on Silkroad. In fact, I&#039;d say I have more interest in being a part of this amazing community of libertarians than the drugs. I have a passion for economics as well as anti-consumerist campaigns. I follow Adbusters almost religiously and am trying my hardest to escape Corporate America.<br /><br />On a side reason: Drugs are easy to come by and I&#039;m not nearly enough of a habitual user that I NEED to order something from here. I will, simply to support the community, purchase from time to time, with the goal of reviewing product/vendors for newbs like myself who don&#039;t know who&#039;s got what and whether or not its worth the risk and money.<br /><br />The point of this thread is to get an idea of the type of people we have here. Businessmen, recreational, functional addict, junkies? Why are you here?

				I stumbled across SilkRoad quite by accident, and stayed because of the liberal atmosphere as well as the vast plethora of specific substances available for the choosing. I&#039;m a regular working-class joe, who enjoys computer-tinkering and recreational drug-use. I&#039;ve got my BitCoins and have selected my purchase... now the wait.<br /><br />Beyond everything else, the steep learning curve has taught me much in just a few days. Tor, TAILS, GPG, Debian Linux, BitCoins and their acquitition, etc. All in all, getting it all set up as securily as I&#039;m likely to need has been rather educational.

				I found SR last year just by doing a little research on tor.<br />Wasn&#039;t even looking for SR, just stumbled upon it.<br />I actually find it odd under the circumstances. I was becoming sober from EVERYTHING.<br />3 months clean. Not really because I wanted to, but rather; HAD to.<br />There were no local resources AT ALL.<br /><br />It&#039;s things like this ^ that make me really wonder about life events.<br />I tried my hardest to avoid drugs, and SR finds me..<br />ON the other hand, because of SR I am able to get quality gear without having drive 40 miles and possibly getting caught, pulled over, or even shot.<br />and because of the shipping delay and limits on my funds, I&#039;m forced to only get so much at a time once a week. Quite handy in the control area.<br />Now I must add, I have a few close friends that I do purchase for, but none of them know where I&#039;m getting from. Don&#039;t want anyone in this town knowing. lol

				<br />Drugs are NOT easy to come by, if you don&#039;t have any friends who are into it.<br />I found SR because I was looking for perception-altering substances for exploration such as psychedelics. Some of these are age-old medicine and really don&#039;t deserve being made illegal.<br />Now, I wouldn&#039;t even consider buying them in some shady area of a big city, or similar places.<br />I also think this forum is very interesting.<br /><br />Why are YOU here ?<br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;ve got a job, and have been well-behaved all my life, except perhaps parking in the wrong place or paying my taxes late. If you think i&#039;m criminal - this is not me, it&#039;s your perception which is distorted due to government propaganda.<br />
