				Hey,<br /><br />First post...brand new to the road, so I&#039;m still getting a feel for pricing. Is it really pretty standard for the price of LSD to consistently over $5US and generally closer to (sometimes over) $10US per hit? I&#039;ve been out of the buying circle for the past few years, but buying a vial (or more) used to get you decently under the five dollar mark (per).<br /><br />I understand times change and that this is a totally different kind of marketplace, but figured I&#039;d check and see what people had to say.

				Hello, yes times have changed! to get really good quality LSD on SR you&#039;ll have to pay from between $10 to 30 usd per hit , so like .05 btc or half 1 Btc&nbsp; perhaps less from some vendors.<br />on the other hand you can get NboMe 25&nbsp; blotters for much cheaper.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

It&#039;s definitely intriguing. I&#039;m thinking it might make a good first purchase on SR. Eyeballing domestic (US) vendors of Molly, too.

				I guess LSD is on a long-term decline, unfortunately. Blotter strength has been decreasing for decades, and in the past years all these new research chemicals have surfaced. Since in many countries the legal status of research chemicals is not that clear, it is cheaper to produce them than LSD-25. Not that many vendors offering good, clean LSD in bulk quantities (2000+ hits), either.

				Those of us in the USA who are involved in the psychedelics scene will definitely find LSD to be more expensive than we&#039;re used to.&nbsp; A year ago I would&#039;ve never said I&#039;d pay $10/hit, but w/ the current scarcity of quality LSD (IMO due to the explosion of nbome family chemicals) I&#039;ve changed my mind.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will vouch for Tesselated having some EXCELLENT LSD.&nbsp; I had a very hard time clicking the buy button and paying the seemingly absurd price, but his claims of 200ug/hit are definitely not bullshit.&nbsp; I gave a quarter tab to a friend at a show who had to work the next day, and he could clearly tell he&#039;d eaten L.<br /><br />I just find it frustrating that there are very few people offering quantity discounts.&nbsp; I&#039;m more than happy to pay $12.60/hit for a quarter sheet of 200mic product seeing as that&#039;s the equivalent of paying about $160 for a quarter sheet of standard (100mic) blotter (about $65/strip), but not getting a discount for anything past there makes me cry a lil on the inside.<br /><br />For the love of god, someone please hit up their chemistry buddies in India and source some of this rose crystal that&#039;s been floating around for the past few months.&nbsp; We need a decent bulk connect on the road ASAP!!!

				Very pleased to hear this as I&#039;ve just gotten 60 x 25i-nbome blotters, although they are not complexed, I&#039;m looking forward to trying them even more now.

				I had some slight nausea one of the times before it kicked in but im not even positive it was because of the 25i-NBOME because i hadnt eaten or drank anything that day and it was really hot so it could have just been because i wasnt looking after myself but personally in my experience i didnt have any downside or adverse effects it really was very similair to lsd in my opinion.
