				My first order was from Arn0ld. He was very quick to ship and reply to ALL of my (sometimes stupid) inquiries.<br />I had (unfounded) questions about the potency of my small sample and in response he sent me two whole grams for free, which I just picked up.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; 8)<br />Some of his messages were a bit angry but I was sometimes being an accusatory, passive-aggressive jackass. Shit happens.<br />Most of his messages were kind and overly appreciative.<br /><br />I hate to see this drama with Arn0ld. There&#039;s more than one side to every story.<br />Just thought I&#039;d share my experience. I will miss him.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />gl arn0ld

				Threatening to use a buyer&#039;s personal information in the way that Arn0ld threatened to do is inexcusable here.&nbsp; Regardless of what the &quot;other side&quot; of the story is, there is absolutely no reason to pretend to be LE, threaten to kill someone, blackmail them, and say you&#039;re going to put a bullet between their kid&#039;s eyes.&nbsp; <br /><br />He said he&#039;s going to BMR, so you can still buy from him there, but threatening buyers and misusing their location information is unacceptable.
