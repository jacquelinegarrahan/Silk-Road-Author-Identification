				I&#039;m really only on SR for MDMA.&nbsp; I like the feedback system and being able to trust in the product I&#039;m buying.&nbsp; My purchase(s) would be for personal use and for tiny quantities at a time (1g).&nbsp; I don&#039;t imagine I&#039;ll be buying more than once a year, if that....<br /><br />With that said, if you were in my position, would you still go through great lengths to ensure anonymity?&nbsp; Trying to get bitcoins into my account anonymously seems like a bit of a hassle...I&#039;m about to give up and use my real info. Bad idea?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				It is legal to buy bitcoins. Especially if you&#039;re buying that small of amounts

				For buyers of personal amounts I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as huge a deal as it is for those buying for resale. But that said running it through a tumbler or blockchain shared send is relatively cheap and can add a little piece of mind. SR tumbles the BTC anyway. But since it&#039;s well known that BTC is often used for illegal things distancing yourself as a purchaser is not necessarily a bad idea.

				I would.<br /><br />The easiest to use is Kleopatra which is part of gpg4win.&nbsp; You copy the seller&#039;s key, go to the kleo logo in your system tray and right click and select add certificate or something like that, then type out your address in notepad and copy it, right click again and select encrypt, the box will come up and you select the seller&#039;s key and then it will encrypt and you are ready to copy onto your SR order.&nbsp; It takes a minute.&nbsp; You can practice a few times as well.

PGP is quite simple once you get the hang of it, so it&#039;s worth figuring it out.

				I wouldn&#039;t be concerned with providing your info for bitcoins but I would send them through a mixer before I sent them to SR. Otherwise take all the precautions of any user. This is your freedom you are risking, do not get complacent. LE would love to knock over some low hanging fruit to make an example of them.<br /><br />For all those that think, oh it&#039;s just a gram - no one will care. That is a dangerous and ignorant comment. If you make it easy for them they will nail your ass to the wall. A gram is enough to earn you a felony and fuck you for the rest of your life.&nbsp; What percentage of drug offenders in prison would you guess are in jail for &quot;personal&quot; amounts of narcotics, 10% 30% 80%?

				If you&#039;re in the US, bitinstant has worked for me.&nbsp; I use the Moneygram option to send cash and use a fake name/address.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been asked to show ID, and I don&#039;t imagine I will be asked to in the future as long as the info I put on the slip matches the info I entered on my receipt from the site.

				Your biggest &#039;security&#039; concern should always be the stealth of the shipper ... So always order a small tester to ensure the stealth meets your expectations.<br />Detection in the post is the greatest risk. I have used Mt. Gox without problem for nearly a year ... But then I am sure that LE tend to have bigger fish to fry!<br />They may suspect my btc are ending up on SR but is it really worth the bother and resources to bust the guy who orders a few tabs etc? I think not ... <br />Be careful, order , sit back relax and await the delight of&nbsp; that special delivery ... Oh and don&#039;t FE!

				There are many good reasons to continue to protect your privacy and anonymity even if you are not doing anything wrong.
