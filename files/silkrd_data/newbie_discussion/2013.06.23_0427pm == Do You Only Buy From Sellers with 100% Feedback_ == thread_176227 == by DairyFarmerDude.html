				Was just wondering...Whats your rue of thumb when purchasing on SR.&nbsp; Will you only buy from those with 100% feedback?&nbsp; Or will you gamble on something less than perfect.&nbsp; I only buy from sellers that are 100%.....I have saved a couple of vendors that I have bought from in the past.&nbsp; But if I notice their feedback has dropped from 100% I will take them off my fav. list and not buy from them again.&nbsp; Not to sound stale.&nbsp; But me and my money have no room for error.&nbsp; And I do understand some buyers are just...well, assholes.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I was wondering.&nbsp; Do you think this a bit rash on my part?&nbsp; What are the general guidelines some of you follow when deciding who to buy from?&nbsp; Thanks for offering your insights.

				I&#039;ve been thinking that for so long, so much could be added to the search functions which would make a lot of what I do manually a lot quicker! Also I&#039;d like a a search function of sorts to look through a vendors feedback, so for example you could see all the sub 5/5&#039;s a vendor got and why.

				On my buyer account I buy from 95+ vendors.&nbsp; If they have less than a 98, I check as much of the recent feedback as I find necessary and check their reship policy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had one bad occurrence which was from a 100 vendor who required FE for all purchases.&nbsp; So for that reason, I still don&#039;t FE.&nbsp; Not ever.<br /><br />You just have to remember there are people&nbsp; behind these pages.&nbsp; If they&#039;re good on a regular basis, they&#039;re still liable to make a mistake or an act-of-God will mess up an order from time to time.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, all you can do is check to make sure they KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE AN ISSUE.&nbsp; Too many vendors say &quot;fuck all&quot; to resolutions, even vendors with 100 feedback, and that&#039;s what sketches me out.&nbsp; And you also have to remember that scammers and pissants can knock a score down considerably from pure spite.<br /><br />Having less than 100 doesn&#039;t mean much, really.&nbsp; Percentage and overwhelming replies of satisfaction are the keys.<br /><br />

				Depends if I&#039;ve dealt with the vendor before or not. 100% is higher than my cut-off, in any event. I&#039;m more concerned with domestic vs international, as there are many scammer buyers who distort feedback. The requirement to leave 5/5 also makes feedback almost meaningless.

				I don&#039;t select a vendor based on feedback percentage alone. Here&#039;s my top 10 list of things to look for in a vendor:<br /><br />1. Domestic<br />2. Generally prefer vendors who sell cannabis only. It&#039;s ok if they sell other non-drug related things, but generally prefer the only drug they sell is cannabis.<br />3. Seller account age; older or least a month or so generally preferred<br />4. Prefer to see some feedback saying excellent stealth, or vendor explicitly says MBB&#039;s or mylar used<br />5. Prefer there to be some recent feedback, within the last couple days.<br />6. Vendor has been online within the last couple days (can&#039;t tell that though if they&#039;re in stealth mode).<br />7. Forum search reveals some good posts from people with + karma and a good number of posts. I think this is harder to &#039;fake&#039; then vendor feedback (more important for newer vendors imho).<br />8. Requires or at least encourages use of PGP for sensitive info.<br />9. Has to be the type of cannabis I&#039;m looking for obviously, in the quantity I am seeking.<br />10. Vendor profile page is fairly detailed and has halfway decent grammar. Doesn&#039;t have to be perfect but needs to show effort and good understanding of product and a concern for customers.<br /><br />So with those requirements there&#039;s maybe a dozen vendors on my short list, so far all tried have been excellent!<br /><br />In general dealing with vendors:<br />When purchasing if the vendor has a tormail or other contact info in case SR is down, it&#039;s good to make a note of that in case you need it.<br />Read the product description and vendor page carefully; some want address in all caps, some want zip + 4, etc., I try to follow the format they ask for.<br />

				Don&#039;t just blindly follow the feedback score. The number tells you almost zero. To properly review a vendor keep close attention to their -latest- events in any way or form.<br /><br />feedback, reviews, forum posts, updates, shipping and order policy to name a few<br /><br />Mine always had 96+ so far...

				I think the feedback score can be misleading b/c vendors will always get a customer they cannot please or some asshole customer.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to look at &#039;RECENT&#039;&nbsp; and read everything you can about the vendor before making a purchase.&nbsp; You have to take some time and do your homework.&nbsp; &nbsp;I generally look at 95+&nbsp; .....&nbsp; I give new vendors a break, a lot of them are trying to make a go and a couple stupid customers can ruin their feedback for a little while.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I&#039;m -not- a vendor !!! )&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)

				No, I usually wont look at a listing that has below 95 but sometimes you have shitty buyers that leave shitty feedback.&nbsp; Eliminating a seller from consideration because they arent at 100% is foolish in my opinion.&nbsp; All it takes is one shitty buyer to ruin 100% and there are a lot of shitty people in this world that will do so.&nbsp; I know this because I use to make a living off of Ebay and despite operating near perfection, I only had 97% when I quit because some buyers will leave bad feedback because they got the package in 5 days versus 4 even though the post stamp clearly shows it was mailed the day it was paid for.&nbsp; Some people just arent reasonable to deal with.&nbsp; You see this when you go to a store or restaurant and there is a guy yelling at a worker for some stupid reason.<br /><br />I check feedback, check the forums, read through the feedback, read through the vendors write-up on their seller page, and go with my gut feeling.&nbsp; I also try not to spend more than I am willing to loose with a new person I havent bought from before.&nbsp; Even if they have 100%, I am not going to setup a $500 transaction with someone I havent done business with before, that is just common sense.

				A rating is only an at-a-glance overview of the vendor&#039;s quality. <br /><br />Never forget that a rating of 100 could be easily achieved by running a couple of lotteries and accepting a few dozen orders that were mostly finalised early. Reading feedback and discussions on this forum is the best way to gauge a vendor&#039;s reliability.<br /><br />One of the most legendary suppliers on Silk Road who&#039;s been here since literally the beginning has 97.

				I would more likely purchase from a vendor with a 97 and feedback on the forum then a vendor with 100 and no feedback on the forum.<br /><br />It is crazy how many vendors have been around for months and have tons of transactions but there is barely a mention of themselves on the forum.<br /><br />If I were a vendor, I would start a feedback thread so people could post feedback.&nbsp; That is probably the best promotion you can do and it is completely free.&nbsp; You have to market a business for it to grow.

				I think every buyer need a different seller!<br />If this wouldn´t be, the market wouldn´t exist.<br /><br />Or for every different thing a different vendor.<br /><br />But i buy at some vendors who have 97 - 99 %, buts it is really ok if the vendor is helpful.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bbcool

				I glance at the feedback number, but recent info from buyers on the relevant &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; forum is much more important.&nbsp; <br /><br />And don&#039;t believe everything you read in the vendor feedback comments, either.&nbsp; More useful than a number, but the most useful data is on the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I give much more weight to how long the vendor has been around and number of transactions than the feedback %.<br /><br />Once you spend some time doing homework around here you will likely conclude that the feedback number system is pretty broken for a few reasons.<br /><br />Stay smart and stay safe.

				I would say read the reviews to get an idea of why someone has 99 or 98 or 94.<br />It may be something silly like &quot;he ran out of the product and refunded the money immediately&quot;. I&#039;ve seen people rate a 3 or a 4 with comments like that. <br />

				I have also read some profiles where it gave an explanation for their rating such as another vendor setting them up or a story of a crazy buyer.<br /><br />SR really needs to add buyer feedback for vendors.&nbsp; This might help blacklist some crazy buyers and also help newer buyers such as myself avoid some of the minimums they have.
