				Most vendor&#039;s offer samples when they start business.&nbsp; Some offer them for free, some charge and that&#039;s fair.&nbsp; A vendor should never feel obligated to donate their product to anyone else.&nbsp; If someone wants a small amount of product they can purchase it.&nbsp; It&#039;s often the case that a new vendor will give discounted &#039;samples&#039; to established members that can verify that they received the product and remark on it&#039;s quality and the service.<br /><br />Most established vendor&#039;s don&#039;t give out samples because they have no need.&nbsp; Their product and feedback speaks for itself.&nbsp; Some newer vendor&#039;s don&#039;t have special deals because they&#039;re confident their product speaks for itself.

				One thing I would like to chime in and let be know...<br /><br />If you are sent 100% free sample or even a free samp pay shipping...<br /><br />If you DO NOT leave honest feedback and a review, that WILL be remembered if you decide to order, your name is then tainted, we will sell to you but our usual generosity on overweight and maybe a free goodie goes out the window.<br /><br />Food for thought, basically... common sense. <br /><br />When a vendor takes the time to submit your inquiry, decrypt add to label, pack your sample, and slap $6.10 worth of postage on your pack and (commit a felony for you) don&#039;t you think that the least you could do in return is follow through on your end of the bargain?<br /><br />Just venting here because that is what KILLED our Free Sample Fridays for everyone. We thought it would be fun to read all the reviews, the samples sent to review ratio was oh... let&#039;s say around 5/10, which is bullshit.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be that guy. However, that&#039;s up to you...<br /><br />Otherwise... Thanks to all who did review!<br /><br />Here is a sample of a good review btw...<br /><br />Re: Official NorthWestDirect reviews (USA DOMESTIC MARIJUANA)<br />« Reply #353 on: January 25, 2013, 01:44 am »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />So my review of the samples I received-<br />Urkle bud, hash, m&amp;m cookies :D<br /><br />5/5 Communication- Kept in contact and answered all of my questions.<br /><br />5/5 Shipping/Stealth- Shipping was quick, he messaged me Monday and told me he was sending it out, I received it today Thursday, I was really thinking it would get here tomorrow so that was a nice surprise for it to show up today. 8)<br />Stealth was good, I know mine was sent before the new stealth improvements, so I can imagine the new improvements make it even much more secure than it already is, nice plus!<br /><br />5/5 Urkle--- I really like this bud, its full of trichomes. Very nice smell upun breaking the bud apart, smells like grape. I loaded up a small bowl and got about 3 good tokes out of it. Very tasty, it also taste of grape. The high hit me and I sat my ass on the couch, stuck staring at the tv lol....<br /><br />5/5 Hash--I think we have a winner here! Smoked a bowl of Urkle with some hash on top., WOW! I&#039;m STONED! lol seriously seems like some really strong shit, I will test it out better tomorrow when I&#039;m not already high, I&#039;ll update!<br />*update*-Hash is fucking bomb! I love it and I&#039;m going to be ordering some no doubt! Super baked right now<br /><br />?/5 M&amp;M Cookies-- I will update this tomorrow, too high right now<br />to fairly review the edibles.....<br />« Last Edit: January 25, 2013, 09:43 pm by calicojak » <br /><br />Cheers and be a good reviewer please!<br /><br />NorthWestDirect

				Free samples are ideal for a new vendor to show off his packaging, stealth, product, communication, and accumulate successful touchdowns.<br /><br />IMO they are a must to do this right.<br /><br />That is... If the sampler does his job.<br /><br />NWD

				Just so all you newbies know... There is a separate vendor only forum called &quot;The Roundtable&quot; us vendors post and communicate amongst eachother and the mods on specific ways <br />to improve the roads function as well as, for instance, buyers to stay away from &quot;the black list&quot; among other very useful topics of discussion with our business.<br />Keep that in mind your rep is just as important as ours, from our end of the spectrum. We don&#039;t want risk just like y&#039;all.<br />Everyone needs to do what they say, what was agreed upon, build relationships, just like the streets only better&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />NWD
