				So, went to make my first purchase today. Double/triple checked everything. Made cash deposit &gt; mtgox &gt; 3 separate instawallets &gt; cumulative instawallet &gt; SR blah blah. SR was credited in about 2 hours?&nbsp; ;D Then I read SR&#039;s little thing about changing pin and password before transferring BTC. So, I went to change the pin. No big deal, I have these numbers stamped into my head. Went to change password, nah I don&#039;t really need to change the password do I? Well lets change it just to be safe. Wait I shouldn&#039;t use a password that I&#039;ve used for anything else in the entirety of the internet though. Hmmmm....... *thinks of password*, awesome I won&#039;t forget this. I was about to write it down then got sidetracked on one of the 20 tabs I had open at the time. Went to install&nbsp; GnuPGP and had to reboot. Alright sweet, I have my BTC in my SR wallet, got PGP encryption figured out, I&#039;m ready to buy my product. Wait...... wtf password not working or did I forget? o.O<br /><br />Now I cannot figure out what my password is, I was pretty sure I knew it because its a phrase that I know but one which I don&#039;t use for other passwords. I&#039;m also not sure if I&#039;m encountering the login problem that other people are running into? I know my pin, I know my first password used, I know my first pin used, but who can I contact for support, SR Support hasn&#039;t been online for over a month.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Help appreciated very much so!

				Something very similar is happening to me right now. Changed my PIN and password before making a deposit, now trying to make a purchase and my PIN doesn&#039;t work. I wrote it down, TWICE. I have the number right in front of me. Obviously I entered the same PIN twice when I changed it, so I don&#039;t know what else it would be. Also tried my old PIN, but no dice. Am I totally fucked right now?

				When you have problems with your password or PIN, you need to get in touch with Support over on SR at the link posted by Namarrg0n.

				Thanks, I figured it out reading the FAQ&#039;s. Glad I&#039;m not fucked, but really annoyed I have to wait 5 days now. The product I was trying to buy was &quot;on sale,&quot; so I probably won&#039;t be able to get it now. Oh well.

				So if we fuck up a password five times in a row, we will be able to reset it after a few days and not lose anything?
