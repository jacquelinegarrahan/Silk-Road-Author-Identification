				i have been buying #3 heroin from a couple of vendors ,frank matthews and c36amg ,for a few months now . <br />when i first bought at the start of the year the heroin was outstanding it took me back to when i first started using 15 years ago .<br />but as time has went on the quality seems to be getting worse .<br />3 weeks ago i bought from frank it was not much better than what i would get on the street plus i got a really bad headache . i messaged him he told me it was the same stuff as i got from him the last few times so it could not have been any worse , i have been taking heroin long enough to know good quality <br />so i started getting from c36 , his was decent at first too but then last week the quality was poor . <br />why is it they are jumping all over it , its not like we are not paying for good quality , they have no need to keep mixing it more and more , its just greed . <br />im paying 240 pound for 3.5g from silk road when i could get it from the street for 100 pound , so the quality should be a lot better than what it is.<br />silk road needs more heroin vendors that ship to the uk , maybe then the quality will get better again

				I do pretty much every drug under the sun and H quality is the most unpredictable in terms of quality and availability. Even more so than coke. I don&#039;t do #3 but do #4 and it&#039;s always a huge gamble. Even amongst the same vendor. One week he has fire and the next it may be garbage. <br />This is even a bigger problem on the street where if the quality is good they pass off lower quantity and if it&#039;s crap they try to make you a deal on bulk. <br /><br />It&#039;s a rough life when your preferred hobby is H

				I&#039;ve got a somewhat different situation but it fits under this subject heading so I&#039;ll write it here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought heroin from three different highly recommended vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no complaints about potency.&nbsp; Each batch was plenty potent.&nbsp; But none of the samples really gave me any pleasure.&nbsp; They all put me on the nod and made me tired, but that&#039;s not why I take heroin.&nbsp; &nbsp;The heroin I used to get (decades ago, as I have not used for decades) was very warm and pleasurable.&nbsp; I really enjoyed socializing on it.&nbsp; The current stuff lacks pleasure, in fact, I see no reason for taking it at all.&nbsp; Has heroin changed somehow in recent decades??

				Orpheus, in my experience it depends on the dose. A lower dose gives me a little energy, some euphoria and a pretty good mood. A larger dose makes me nod hard and when that ends, I just kind of feel flat lined, neither happy or sad. <br /><br />I would suggest DieselTherapy if you want some H that&#039;s a little different. Check out some of his reviews from today on the main site.

				i think some of the heroin vendors on silk road are mixing the heroin with feyntanol as that is a lot stronger than heroin but the high you get from it is not like heroin it just knocks you out and the effect wears off very quick , maybe thats why iv been getting the headaches .<br />and im not the only one that thinks this i seen a review on c63amg s heroin and it said he thought it was mixed with feynt

				yah fentanyl is shit. it is extremely potent but the high is nothing like junk. i have found a local vendor with consistent quality. small doses and i&#039;m very social, mood lift and nice body buzz. higher doses brings a heavy nod with a thick blanket of warm euphoria. best feeling junk i have done on SR.

				I&#039;ve also gotten amazing quality on SR.&nbsp; And the worst quality I&#039;ve ever seen, so bad that I actually washed it down the sink.&nbsp; Quality around here varies, but I&#039;ve found that established vendors are fairly consistent.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get #3 though, so I can&#039;t speak to that.

				Well, now with our spammer we&#039;ve lost the thread of the conversation.&nbsp; I hope someone picks it up from here.&nbsp; I was going to ask WoundedVet whose heroin was really great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had gotsitall, MisterMcFeely and subsrgood, all highly recommended and all very potent.&nbsp; But not pleasurable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered Nods4Less which should get here Monday.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I&#039;m taking too much or too little.&nbsp; I know my way around heroin.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that I don&#039;t get the pleasurable feelings from it that I used to get years ago.&nbsp; I did some with a friend last night who I used to use with years ago, and he agreed.&nbsp; He went on the nod big time, but didn&#039;t find it particularly pleasurable.&nbsp; I know there must be some really pleasurable, warm, euphoric dope on here somewhere, but it&#039;s getting expensive for me to be trying all this dope without really enjoying it.&nbsp; At least now I&#039;m ordering 1/4 gram instead of full grams.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s not a matter of cut, it&#039;s just that different batches of heroin have different feelings.&nbsp; Some is euphoric, some just puts you on the nod.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve only been able to find the latter so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;By and large, I think the quality of heroin 30 years ago was just better than what is available today.&nbsp; Why, I don&#039;t know.

				DM is dextromorphene or something like that.&nbsp; It&#039;s in cough syrup.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done it myself.&nbsp; As for your theory about why I don&#039;t have great experiences with heroin these days, I don&#039;t think your explanation is right.&nbsp; When I used to do heroin I used to get high very nicely every time, as long as the dope was good.&nbsp; I was never chasing anything.&nbsp; Now, after 30 years of being abstinent, I should, if anything, be more sensitive to it.&nbsp; And also a friend of mine who I&#039;ve shared my dope with had the same reaction (no euphoria to speak of).&nbsp; So the mystery continues.&nbsp; If I find something which really does it for me, I&#039;ll post here.

				I tried a small dash of street H about a week ago. Was interesting to say the least. Add on top a bowl of some fine MJ and experienced quite the buzz. But I won&#039;t screw with it anymore. I have too high of an addictive personality. Coke is good enough for me, and even then, I don&#039;t have outlets to get it (just whenever it happens to pop up) so I limit myself on the amount I get to enjoy. Usually I stick to natural shit (shrooms, weed, etc). Shit used in it&#039;s natural form isn&#039;t going to kill you. The processed and hard drugs always have that risk, and I am still enjoying life and this earth and would like to stick around for a little longer. <br /><br />As far as DM, did that shit a few times in high school. Back with Corcidin or whatever it&#039;s called. It was okay, but nothing I would really want to fuck with long term, as there are significant brain traumaus that can come along with it. I will say though that the person I did it with saw a big dump truck and was thoroughly convinced that it was a 50&#039; rodeo bull that was about ready to charge us. Crazy shit.

				I used to get no euphoria either, no matter if it was 80% pure pakistani no.4 straight from the factory or crappy no.3. Note that my ROA had always been IV. But then, I was out of rigs once and decided to try it intranasally. Boy. What a difference. I did not catch a nod, but the HEAVENLY euphoria was absolutely fantastic. Never got anything close to it when IVing. It was like a completely different drug. Strange.

				if you have never tried heroin i would leave it that way . there are not many users that can take it just now and again without any problems , there are some but i would say under 1 percent . <br />im what you call a functioning addict , i use heroin but get on with my life , keep my house smart food in the cupboards , kids looked after ect ect .&nbsp; and as i say there are not many heroin users that can say that . <br />yes the high is out of this world but it will get a hold of you without you even knowing and one morning you will wake up all sore and think you have the flu and feel terrible take a bit of H and what you know no more pain and thats you hooked . <br />

				I&#039;ve observed the change, no doubt about it, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what would account for it.&nbsp; It is not unreacted morphine because morphine gives an intense pins and needles rush (too intense) and no one has reported that.&nbsp; (I snort so I wouldn&#039;t know.&nbsp; It is true that morphine isn&#039;t as euphoric as heroin so that is a good guess.
