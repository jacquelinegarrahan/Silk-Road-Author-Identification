				But almost all of them do and they have a great excuse cause I am a new buyer!?? How is it any different than buying drugs via non-SR if you FE. It should be against the rules- period!

				You have to realize it&#039;s also to protect vendors as well from being ripped off. Buy from some of the communities most trusted sellers first, they may ask you to FE early and it should be understandable. Once you got a few transactions under your belt you don&#039;t really have to worry about FE and should take the precaution to not do so especially when ordering from some new vendors.

				For bitcoins, I use www.bitinstant.com.&nbsp; The downside is that you&#039;ll pay about $7 in fees, but if I want $400 in my SR account, I can have it in about 4 hours if I go this route.

				Once it converts from USD to Bitcoins, it becomes anonymous.&nbsp; There is no mechanism for seeing what entity did what with who&#039;s address.&nbsp; Even if there were, SR routes payments through so many different addresses that it becomes impossible to determines the end point, not entirely unlike how the Tor network itself works.&nbsp; It&#039;s why Bitcoin is complained about sometimes by senators as a means to launder money.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite safe.&nbsp; When I do the cash transfer at Wal-Mart, they just think I&#039;m paying a bill.&nbsp; So does Moneygram, who is actually handling the transfer.&nbsp; Bitinstant knows it&#039;s going to a bitcoin address, but after that - poof! - it&#039;s gone.

				Tezzyflocko26,<br />So you are new, I really hope you have spent hours researching the site, the forum, the wiki, DPR&#039;s buyers guide, this will answer most of your questions without driving people nuts with questions they have answered too many times already.I spent a month reading on here, and MOST important is to use encrypted communication, except the forum. Most vendors will not communicate without encryption. The VERY easiest program to learn is the GPG4USB. I spent weeks trying both 4USB and 4Win. 4USB is far superior and there is a link to a very easy to use learning manual that a member here has provided. PM me if you want the link. Also, if in the USA, Blue Sky Traders are trustworthy and extremely fast. I went to the bank, made a deposit in their account and by the time I got home in 45 minutes the bitcoins were in my account. They have a link here, I would suggest contacting them via their email on SRoad and encrypting your message. Good Luck, feel free to PM me with any questions. Hope this info has helped. SunQueen
