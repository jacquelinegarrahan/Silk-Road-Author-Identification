				Having received a number of reports on this, I feel I should clarify the situation here:<br /><br />As much of a pain as InfiniteSource is, he is not breaking any rules by posting those links. Copyright law etc. does not apply here for obvious reasons. When a vendor sells a digital good any member can re-post it for free or re-sell it themselves (via a vendor account) if they wish. That is a right that is guaranteed by the freedom of speech that is protected in this community.<br /><br />Libertas
