				Whats the point on having the FE option on SR??<br /><br />Here everything is to be sad to completley Anonymous so why offering FE.<br />Wouldnt it be better for every Transaction to stay in Escrow, isnt that better for Vendor and Buyer??<br /><br />I never heard of FE on ebay

				EVERYONE FE&#039;s on eBay - you pay before they send it. always. of course on eBay sellers are known and so if they flip on the deal you get your money back. you FE here and the seller doesn&#039;t send anything, it&#039;s your loss, the vendor is unreachable so you&#039;ve done your money

				For your own protection as a buyer, you should never FE. The SR escrow system is very effective and offers protection for both parties, use it :)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				if they are in your favourites, when you click on them it just goes to a &#039;send message&#039; screen it means their vendor privileges have been revoked, so yes, both those guys have been given the boot

				If they have FE on their vendors page at least they are upfront about it and not pming you to FE.<br /><br />I don&#039;t FE apart from a recent 7 cents for a sample not going to hurt the bank&nbsp; :D<br /><br />When I first came to SR I read never FE so never did.<br /><br />I just started buying small things with no stats that vendors would not care about losing too much.<br /><br />This can also get you around the minimum of 5 or 10 transactions as long as they don&#039;t have a purchase amount on their page as well and keeps you in escrow.<br /><br />One thing I always did is release the escrow as rapid as I could on getting the goods and the vendor might remember that when he deals with you again.<br /><br />I got great stats now so no one asks me to FE.
