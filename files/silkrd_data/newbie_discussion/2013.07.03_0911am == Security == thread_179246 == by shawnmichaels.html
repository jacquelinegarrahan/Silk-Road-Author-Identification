				So I know there is another section for this, but I cannot post there yet so wanted to get your views.<br /><br />What are the best way of staying safe while browsing.... Not talking about buying here.<br /><br />I use Tails OS for all my lets say, want to be unwatched browsing. Is this the best way to do it?<br /><br />Thoughts and advise as ever.<br /><br />

				thats right, your ISP can see that you are using TOR, but they cannot see on which sites you are. <br /><br />If this is still not enough security for you, try out TAILS. It is really easy to install and you dont have to worry about getting leaked because of java javascript or pdf and the like. And as an extra, you can easily use bridges, so that your ISP wont even see that you are using TOR (but dont ask me how this works, i am not really tech savvy, thats just the things i could find out)<br /><br />

				Also I know I mentioned this yesterday as I wanted help with it! but i will ask again in this thread.<br /><br />How do you wipe something making data unrecoverable to anyone? FBI/NSA etc, but still useable.... I haven&#039;t done anything illegal, but I don&#039;t want to be traced....

				Unless you&#039;re using a VPN, your ISP can see that you&#039;re connecting to a TOR relay, and will know the date and time of any connections. Tails users have similar fingerprints as those using the TOR browser bundle, so basically you&#039;ll look to your ISP like a TBB user, and maybe, with some additional investigation, as though you&#039;re using Tails. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about your ISP monitoring your use of TOR, either get a VPN or restrict your TOR browsing to public wifi connections.&nbsp; In the first case your ISP will be able to see that you&#039;re using an VPN, but would have no idea that you&#039;re using TOR, and VPNs, unlike TOR, are extremely common: many people use them to connect to their work or school networks. <br /><br />I&#039;d personally not be comfortable with my ISP knowing about my TOR usage - it seems something they&#039;d obviously flag, if not be required already to report to certain authorities. If you&#039;re not ordering much tho you probably don&#039;t have much to worry about. Tails will definitely keep your ISP from knowing *what* you&#039;re looking at. :)

I don&#039;t think the paranoia is worth $100-200? <br /><br />If you&#039;re that worried, buy a new HDD. Then use the program, or a few different programs, on the old HDDs. Unscrew the HDD casing and remove the discs, apply supermagnets to them. Cut them up with power tools into tiny pieces, then find places to hide the pieces. You can ask Siri where to hide a dead body if you&#039;re not sure where to hide the pieces. Perhaps devise a plan to get the parts into space.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Right your ISP will definitely know if you&#039;re hitting tor entry nodes. Whether they care or not is another matter. If you use any of the popular VPN&#039;s you can configure it to through the VPN before hitting the tor entry node. VPN&#039;s are extremely common for people accessing work/corporate networks for working remotely or from home so I would rather the ISP (and likely NSA etc haha) see VPN traffic rather than hitting tor entry nodes all the time.<br /><br />For wiping hard drives, you need any of the tools that rewrite the data many times. Such as writing it with all 1&#039;s then all 0&#039;s then all 1&#039;s again. How many times this is necessary probably varies, but after enough times, then it is not possible to extract the original data.
