				Not sure if support staff can do anything about your pin i do know if its your password you need to start another account msg them about problem from new account and include SR wallet address you last deposited BTC to and they help you by resetting password<br /><br />Worst comes to worst only 10,000 possible combinations to try before you get your coins <br /><br />You should have a vauge idea of the pin like first number then theres only 1000 combinations&nbsp; <br /><br />Good Luck

				yes it happens 3 times a day around here...go jerk off on clearnet at motherless for 3 hours and check back, if no response repeat until response is received...in reality you wont have access for 6 days.<br /><br />Hopefully lesson learned?

				before you gon inputting your pin too many times confirm it with the sr support team, just in case! but yeah seems to be that. put your pin 5 times and it will log you out and ask for your password and then for a new pin :) let us know how you get on, as it would be good for the rest of us to know as well.

				Trying to put in a pin 5times will lock your wallet and a pin then has to wait a certain amount of days before you can try your pin again...this is to keep account phishers from stealing your btc. YOU CAN&#039;T JUST TRY IT 5 TIMES AND THEN GET TO MAKE UP A NEW PIN!!!

				so once i forgot my pin, the system locked my account to make orders and what-not. i could still log on to SR, to window shop. once the 72hour lockdown was over it gave me a link, which made me create a new PIN! that made me a very happy man :) #SRizTHEsh!t
