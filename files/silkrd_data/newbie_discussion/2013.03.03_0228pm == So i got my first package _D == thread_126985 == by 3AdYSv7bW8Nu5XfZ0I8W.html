				Congrats.&nbsp; &nbsp;On my first pack, if was day 3 and I was terrified.&nbsp; So I MSG the vendor , &quot;hey, what&#039;s up?&nbsp; It&#039;s been three days now.&nbsp; It must have got intercepted.&nbsp; Now what? &quot;<br /><br />The vendor replies,&nbsp; &quot;relax dude.&nbsp; It takes three days at least to cross the country.&nbsp; It&#039;ll come , just wait.&quot;<br /><br />Sure enough, day four it arrived safe and sound.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was so nervous and scared for no reason at all.<br /><br />Anyway, gangs and dealers have been shipping drugs in the mail for 20 years now.&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing new to authorities.&nbsp; It&#039;s the big boxes they are looking for and concentrate on. <br /><br />They don&#039;t even x day the small ones that look like letters, so everyone can sit back and relax.<br />As for me, I only order domestic and never bulk to a home address , only a PO box.&nbsp; I also stick to just a few vendors who have really unbelievable stealth (like, the shit it totally hidden inside a sealed product box like a new iphone case) so if someone opened it, or it got sent to a cop,I wouldn&#039;t even flintch.&nbsp; It&#039;s that good.<br /><br />So hey, yu get what you pay for.&nbsp; Go cheap and you get cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />Welcome to heaven.

				Congrats! I got my first package on Thursday (a gram of coke), and managed to wait til last night (Saturday) to try it. It&#039;s a really satisfying feeling getting it in the mail and knowing I succeeded in making this purchase after it seemed so daunting at first. Now I&#039;m waiting on some Xanax, and about to order some more coke for my birthday. Fun times!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126985.msg876067#msg876067">Quote from: posiky on March 03, 2013, 05:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">congrats :)<br />i&#039;m gonna oder mine as soon as i figure out how to use PGP :D........<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />posiky, I was about to give up on figuring out PGP, and then I found this video:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SywCI91kfq0<br /><br />and all of a sudden it clicked, and I was making an order within a couple days when I was able to get some bitcoins. Hope it helps!

				Congrats on all the successful first time buys. It does work. Ain&#039;t it great?&nbsp; Now, did each of you go back onto SR and immediately finalize your order so your vendor can get his money? Leave 5/5 feedback and a nice comment? As a vendor, I can tell you a nice comment and good rating will go a long way in helping you get deals down the road. In fact, this info is so important to the vendor, that if you are not going to leave a 5/5 I recommend messaging the vendor first and let them know what the issue was and give them a chance to &quot;make it right&quot; or some such. <br /><br />I try to run a tight ship and up until recently, had a perfect 5/5 on every transaction. Recently, someone did not like my shipping or packaging&nbsp; - they did get it. For this, the guy left me a 4/5. I have no idea what the guy&#039;s issue with the packaging was. My packaging is pretty stealthy and I have had comments such as good stealth and such so I am pretty confident that the issue may have been with the Post Office - perhaps they tore the package and re-taped it or something. I have no idea. What I do know is that buyer will never get another package from me. Leaving a 4/5 without even messaging what the problem was is unacceptable in my book.<br />

				Congrats to all receiving that first pack. And good wishes to all those who are preparing to embark on that journey. The second, third and everyone after that will feel just as good. Just remember to never grow too comfortable with our chosen lifestyles because unfortunately there are those out there that would wish nothing more than to see all of us rot in prison..<br /><br />1. Make sure your vendor of choice has a good stealth track record.<br />2. Make sure your fake name is not so cheesy that the postman is thinking, &#039;Why are Mr and Mrs Smith, who have lived here for 20 years, getting mail for Mr. Chong Wang?&#039;<br />3. Deny. Deny. Deny! And deny. Never, ever admit to anything, not even the slightest alternative story that a detective will be more than happy to play your buddy and help you think up. THEY are not your friend and care about NOTHING but busting your ass! Deny, and then zip the lip. Nothing you can say to the cops is going to change anything. Again, that is, &#039;Deny it and Zip it!&#039;<br />4. Do no under any circumstances tell your clients, friends, relatives or neighbors that you ordered dope in the mail.<br />5. Do spend some time learning how to keep your computer clean. Truecrypted drives, live cd&#039;s and not writing crap down about your accts or anything else that would give anyone else info to get into any of those resources.<br />6. Be careful with how you go from acquiring bitcoins to getting them credited to your SR account. It is a good idea to have some legitimate btc activities in place. Exchange accounts, your own wallet stash, etc. But none of those should ever be used to fund your SR acct.<br />7. There is more, a lot more you can do. Never shrug off reading anything related to securing your personal data on your computer or info related to properly using Tor.<br />8. SMILE!&nbsp; :D

				I remember my first beer :)&nbsp; It took me awhile to work up the nerve. I didn&#039;t know to encrypt my name and address oops. I was scared shitless waiting for it to come, rehearsing what I would tell the cops not to mention my old lady. Then silk road went down I couldn&#039;t log on. I thought I ruined it, &#039;what an elaborate scam just to bust me.&#039; Then it showed up, silk road came back online, the planets aligned and I just kept thinking &quot;why haven&#039;t I been doing this for years&quot;. SR is a great place:)
