				Hello friends.<br /><br />I know it is normal for .onion websites to go down frequently, but I couldn&#039;t access this place the entire weekend until right now when I checked it. Is it normal for the forum (or Silk Road) to go under for so long?<br /><br />Thanks for any response, I cant wait to try SR services.

				Yes, it was down since Thursday but all is well and it&#039;s back.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; No, that doesn&#039;t happen often.

				That&#039;s good to know scout. I only recently decided to finally seek out the Silk Road after putting it off for so long.&nbsp; I joined about the time the SR forums went down, and now that the forum is back I am glued to it.
