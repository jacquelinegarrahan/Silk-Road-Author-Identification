				who are well, whats your purpose, whats mine? in the life of anonymity one will always watch is back, look at phone twice. this is the life were forced to live. hiding somewhere where instead a keyboard should express me then my mouth a sense created for communication. were going deeper and under. <br /><br />i have to go upto 50 posts to talk on the main threads, whats the aim? getting tired gaining pounds by pounds sitting here, the place that may feed some of you, the place that may connect one another, the place were you death was in your fate. We dont know of any deaths, since the ones that could death are being openly sold as raw material. we should minimise the risks by product and who its sold to. like fentanyl. no way this can be sold in powder form, its fucking transmerdal. now googleeyed are you after the money more? or the status? any moral and ethics at al? You ever sat infront of 1kg of fentanyl and see how that feels, fuck me even 10g? the danger? why not pass this advice on to your customers to and why shouldnt we set more standards on SR.. If the buyers criteria fits the bill then he is able to purchase on a contractual agreement. cause death is easy and chasing money the way some of you guys are lol. dont have a clue on whos behind who. <br /><br />To DPR&nbsp; will listen to this old humble man,<br /><br />There are some dangerous drugs on here and we should set standards to health and safety so the customer isnt at risk. You as the seller know all of its uses, so will the buyer in clear and black and white, and if you cant even get to that stage the sale should cease.<br /><br />some of you guys really don&#039;t know what your playing with, theres loads of misconceptions, empty accusations. <br /><br />don&#039;t chase the money, let the money chase you, if it doesnt chase you then your not suppose to have it. <br /><br />you know these people are ill. and making money of the ill, wow. dpr same on you for not at least building a criteria for these sales.

				So i wish if Dpr set some standards so no damage is done to the buyer or seller. harm reduction. most are middle men here, 90% but the rest who arent are the ones ticking this place over, so some appreciation to the top ten % of vendors, this includes limetless, i mean by knowing him he lives up to his name. there are no ends to his limits, and looking forward to your future ventures.<br /><br />Dpr you aint stupid, you ve created a network that god knows how long will last. but please think about the harm reduction ona&nbsp; few particular chemicals. i do organic chemistry so i know how drugs will react and if which one,<br /><br />if theirs anything that needs to synthesized please do let us know<br /><br />

				stay away from the most recent synthetics like mdpv and methylone, yes they have gone rare, well not really i can get them so if i can so can you, but metylone is a very dirty cathinone that can lead to strokes, i never knew i would ever say this but mephedrone and jwh-019-jwh-073 are the safest iv come across. <br /><br />mdpv can cause gr eight anxiety and methylone to. both could either lead or make your believe your actually having a stroke or a heart attack.<br /><br />limetless mephedrone doesnt need a nmr, its pure and i will give him credit because its damn clean. . how do i know that? i can feel it would be the best indicator and&nbsp; how much serotonin and dopamine i releases and just like what a lot of people said its better then pre ban, im confident of this. because my last visit to china the by roducts got an hot acetone wash. since then i will not trust the chinese, leave a dirty by product for a weight increase which only gains them 50-100 usd. Nmrs are faked, gc ms are faked, iv seen it front of my eyes. <br /><br />on or side we get a nice clean fedex package snorting the fuck out that nast shit. yes it was very speedy. 3mmc is the speed. 4mmc is pure empathy and love. <br /><br />

				to DPR:<br />&nbsp;<br />you have created something new that must have brought confusion as you had to cross bridges, but the selling of heroin is making money of the ill? These are ill people that need professional help. Dpr isn&#039;t going to prescribe them drugs and explain exactly how to taper of and make nice regular&nbsp; visits to see if they are getting on ok. These things are best left to the streets because they facilitate for the ill.when (DPR) isnt around, im just telling you facts.<br /><br />We are a open peaceful community that now has remote ability to get what we want. But things like fent, it has to be super visioned and im sure from your profit margins this year you can afford someone to supervise this.<br />

				Safety? How safe is it to buy gear off the street? At a rave someone hands you &quot;something&quot;? Before SR my safety standard was to watch someone else take it and wait an hour before taking myself. For the first time I feel some measure of confidence in my recreational drug-taking. Plus the forums have given me useful information on safe dosage levels etc. For me, this is the safest its ever been.
