				I have a few security questions...<br /><br />Question 1) I am running tails Live now, though I haven&#039;t yet created a persistent feature (or know what that is yet). When I try to access SR or clearnet, i get a warning saying that my information can easily be read by a 3rd party. Is this normal? If not what can I do to create a secure connection? It also says failed to synchrnize clock which it mentioned was very important when using TOR..<br /><br />Question 2) Lets say that I was using windows, and like an idiot typed in SR address before tor.check even loaded during the security breach. This might have even happened a few times.<br /><br />Am I still at huge risk even though I never used/visited tormail or anything besides SR?<br />What exactly happens(ed)(ing) to my computer besides my MAC address/IP address being sent to Virginia. Where they logging my keystrokes?<br />Is my identity compromised (IP?)<br />Should I destroy my computer?<br />Should I automatically clear house?

You can ignore that warning.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Question 2) Lets say that I was using windows, and like an idiot typed in SR address before tor.check even loaded during the security breach.
