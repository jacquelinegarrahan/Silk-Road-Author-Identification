				Title: <strong>New User - Newb Question</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>stimmedupmarine</strong> on <strong>August 21, 2013, 07:43 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello,<br /><br />I am a totally new user - never made a purchase. I&#039;&#039;m interested in making a purchase but I can only assume that some vendors are skeptical of new users such as myself. My question is should I be trying to make contact with these vendors to ask if they&#039;ll do business with a newb like me or just jump right in there and make a purchase? I&#039;ve got funds available and would love to get started but I&#039;m unsure of newb etiquette. Any guidance is much appreciated.

				I would say make the purchase, and then send them a message saying hey I am new you are my first purchase.&nbsp; They may require to FE due to the fact that you don&#039;t have any buys, and or might just let you know that they would prefer that you had some purchases.&nbsp; Worst case scenario they cancel the order, best case scenario they take it and ship you your goodies :D<br /><br />hope that helps<br />

				Do what I did - get a single coin and make a few small orders. It&#039;s a new world, and getting comfortable with the process and what to expect is a great way to get started.
