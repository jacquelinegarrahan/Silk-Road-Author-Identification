				<br /><br />I currently have a legit prescription for Testosterone Cypionate 200mg X10 ml. I was browsing around on the road and it looks like at least one vendor here has better prices than the discount pharmacy I use. The last of it I bought,&nbsp; I got for $115.00. That&#039;s w/o insurance. I saw a vendor is offering it for .34 BTC, or roughly 40 bucks.&nbsp; That one kind of surprised me. <br /><br />Any other drugs you&#039;ve seen that are actually less expensive here than at the pharmacy? I suspect Viagra is one, but I&#039;ve never had a script for that.<br /><br />

				$25 -$55 for a 10ml vial of 250mg/ml on clearnet depending on where you buy from.&nbsp; Cheaper for 20 and 21ml vials.&nbsp; If you want a legit source at these prices you can PM me.

				By the way, the reason it is so cheap is because it is cheap as piss to buy the raw steroids, mix it and put it in vials.

				Is it generic?&nbsp; Is it outside the US?<br /><br />There&#039;s so much overhead fees for prescriptions in &#039;murica that it&#039;s almost funny how little it costs other countries.&nbsp; Some other countries get access to generics quicker than &#039;murica too.

				Not sure what the brand I saw advertized that price was. What I get at the pharmacy is made by Watson. I&#039;m pretty sure this wasn&#039;t Watson I saw on The Road. It was a U.S. Seller though.

PM me for better sources if you would like.&nbsp; I wont reply until I get my other computer fixed though (hopefully tomorrow), :)

But I&#039;m not just about the price.<br />The human mechanism also agree. :)<br />And it does for the most people.<br /><br />I love the road. I hope like everyone here * grin *<br /><br />Have a Nice day.<br /><br />ps. Fuck Atlantis !
