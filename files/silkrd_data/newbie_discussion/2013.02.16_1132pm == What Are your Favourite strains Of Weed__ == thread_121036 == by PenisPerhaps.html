				Best smoke to date is some Amnesia Haze in Amsterdam &#039;08. Felt like a total newbie and actually felt like we got amnesia for a few hours. Could not find our way to the hotel but ended up in Madame Tussauds for half price and had an awsome time :)

I am not asking anyone to FE. The escrow system is the most important part of this marketplace. The rebate is basically just a discount for repeat customers.
