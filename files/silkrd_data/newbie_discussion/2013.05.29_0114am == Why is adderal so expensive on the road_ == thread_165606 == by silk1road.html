				Its not just adddys, its all RX pills here.. only the US has such a supply for them, out side of the US the demand far exceeds the supply, hence dictating the market value here on SR. Only a small portion of SRs users are from the states, id say a good bit of users are through out the rest of the world.

				yeah i miss the prices on US college campuses where people were over prescribed and willing to essentially give away addys or sell them for beer money. most of my european friends weren&#039;t even as familiar with adderall when they came here, and since SR is a world market I think it&#039;s a simple supply-demand equation.

				College students + finals + all that loan money/parents money. It probably doesn&#039;t help that the transactions aren&#039;t that casual, so the sellers have the advantage.<br /><br />Having said that, I don&#039;t know, because I&#039;m a total newbie. But that&#039;d be my guess.

				It&#039;s cheap when you have plenty of supply, and expensive when you don&#039;t. You&#039;d be crazy to pay $30 a pop on a college campus, but the rest of the world doesn&#039;t necessarily have easy access. The prices are high on SR because people are willing to pay for it.

I know that feeling. The day of finals, after we finished all of our exams, a classmate and I went to her place (she had a script for 30 mg XR&#039;s), crushed up about 10 of those fuckers and snorted them all within a couple hours. I probably did 6-7. One of the dumber moments in my drug history. I felt amazing for about eight hours and like death for about seventy-two.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Holy shit that&#039;s a ton of amphetamine!!!&nbsp; But yep...same, crushed up a 30 mg XR at a party.&nbsp; Went out for breakfast the following morning like we always did after a party night and all the food was repulsive.&nbsp;

				My alternative to adderal is methylone.&nbsp; To me m1 doesn&#039;t feel like rolling at all but that adderal buzz, lots of energy, limbs feel good when you move around, and very talkative.&nbsp; Get a lot of shit done at work that&#039;s for sure!

And then I want a prescription for some stimulant ADHD medication because theyre about 1000 times more effective than the anti-depressant variety they want me to take. And more fun! But alas.. health is important as well. And since I&#039;d like to live forever, I do try to limit the amphetamine intake :)
