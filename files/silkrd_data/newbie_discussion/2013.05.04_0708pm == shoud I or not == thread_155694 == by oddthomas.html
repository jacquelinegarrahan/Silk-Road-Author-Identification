				Well Fuck<br />&nbsp;Just found one of my spouses hiding places! We have some sick twisted enjoyment of hiding our pills from each other! Should I take it or not it is just one. Although our supply is really weak and I know that they&#039;ll be super pissed if I do.. On other hand I also know&nbsp; they would take mine in heartbeat.. <br /><br />Tough decisions <br /><br />Thoughts....??

				dude, you have SR access, just get some BTC and in a few days youll have whatever pill you want without taking your significant others.<br /><br />OTOH, maybe take it, but don&#039;t take(consume) it and if (s)he notices and calls you out just give it back but it they never notice then enjoy haha.

				Well I say, this really is a most bothersome dilemma!&nbsp; The finding of the hiding place is something that you want to conceal, yet the popping of the pill that would certainly reveal.&nbsp; If you pop it down your throat, i&#039;d suggest to leave a note.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine something like this would really get on their goat.<br /><br />Thats my advice anyway.&nbsp; Toodle pip!

				Replace it with a bible.<br /><br />Then they will believe you if you just say you found god and flushed it to save them.<br /><br />Or, don&#039;t.<br /><br />Actually don&#039;t. Buy yer own!

				If it&#039;s going to seriously damage the relationship then I wouldn&#039;t do it... but you know the situation better than I do. If you think you can get away with it in the long run then it&#039;s your conscience that has to deal with the fallout. The problem is that now you know where the stash spot is... so in the future if you get that itch you might end up doing it anyway. If you feel like it&#039;s going to seriously destroy trust with your spouse I&#039;d come clean and say you came across the spot, you&#039;re tempted, and if they don&#039;t wanna lose the damn thing they better come up with a new spot. Otherwise, eat/snort/bang that son of a bitch and deny it until you&#039;re blue in the face.
