				I order from both Asia, India and Europe regularly and I have never had an issue. I use trusted vendors, a private mailbox and a legit business name though. I doubt if I was always ordering from my house to my own name it might now have worked out how it has.

				no idea re: Korea, and for some reason I doubt anyone else will. Seems like an atypical place for ordering durrrgs.<br /><br />@OP<br />I try to keep it as domestic as possible, but I have had to order from overseas several times, plus from UK-based clearnet RC vendors and clearnet Etizolam from India (although the postage said Singapore), with one etizolam order that got lost in the mail (no customs letter or anything). Everything else went swimmingly (knock on wood)<br /><br />Anything in particular you wanted to know?

				Ive ordered from overseas a number of times and have been successful each time. The only downside is the time it takes and the possibility of it getting intercepted is much great...<br /><br />however, for the price, its a risk i&#039;m willing to take. Just be sure to research vendors and see what their refund/reship policies are as some offer no resolution and others are more than willing to refund or reship.

				It would help if you told us your general location. <br />I order stuff from ebay all the time, and I&#039;ve got several packages from China. I&#039;m in the US. I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to order something that came from China, but I&#039;m not sure about other countries. Seems someplace like Afghanistan would get a lot more scrutiny. <br />I heard people living in Australia have a hard time getting stuff in. I&#039;d have them send small quantities in a envelope, not a package. <br />Customs and their effectiveness vary hugely from one region to another like Australia and the US for instance.

				In my experience, China packages to the US are pretty fast. I get things in about a week maybe a little longer. The Chinese shipping company (I forget the name) that is the biggest shipper is very efficient in my opinion.

				I do all of the time, with few problems.&nbsp; The biggest problem with ordering from overseas is the time it takes to arrive

				Korea is a long way to go for ordering something, better off with a EU US vendor. Ive ordered from EU to US before with no problems on a few occasions, it just takes forever to get here.
