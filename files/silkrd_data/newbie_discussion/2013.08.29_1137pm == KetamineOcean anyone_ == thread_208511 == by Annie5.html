				i ordered 8/28, wednesday daytime.<br />In his profile he says I ship every week Monday and Thursday if you place by this time blah blah<br /><br />So I made sure to place before then! Well he did not ship it....<br /><br />he emailed me 8/30, Friday night:<br /><br />&quot;Hey, thank you for your order. I do apologize but I thought I would be up front and let you know that your order will not ship til Saturday because I am so behind on orders right now. Look for a message from me on Saturday to touch base, let you know if there are any issues (incorrect address, etc) and let you know about your order. Thank you for baring with me, I will add some extra to your package for being so patient.<br /><br />KO&quot;<br /><br />I replyed &quot;Okay, that sucks, but whatever, thanks for the extras and look forward to seeing it shipped on saturday.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I log in on saturday... see a new message from him:<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Thanks for your order. I kindly ask that you finalize early so that I can get my coins cashed out earlier with the volatility of the btc market right now. I will throw in a bunch of goodies for you to sample also. Your order is good to go as soon as soon as you finalize.&quot;<br /><br />HAHAHAHA! Bullshit. I never FE.<br /><br />I&#039;ve shopped a lot. I have amazing stats. I never ONCE had a problem on here. Go fuck yourself if you think I&#039;m going to FE with you when you didn&#039;t mention that requirement in your first message, NOR your item listings, NOR your seller profile .. all of which I read carefully when deciding to place an order with you.<br /><br />He had marked it as &quot;in transit&quot; at that time.<br /><br />So, fuck this guy. DO NOT ORDER FROM HIM. <br />

He was a seller for several months too.<br /><br />However my orders were cancelled and I got my coin back. Not sure if SR Admin cancelled or him but I did make a report.<br /><br />Glad they dont get away with this anymore.<br /><br />Never FE!!

				LOL at wanting to finalize early because of the bitcoin price.&nbsp; This is a legit. issue for vendors if the price is dropping, but it&#039;s not.&nbsp; It&#039;s rising and has been rising.&nbsp; So say you buy something worth 1 bitcoin at about $135 and then in the next week while you wait for your package bitcoin goes up another $20 to $155 then that vendor just made an extra $20 when you finalize.&nbsp; I can&#039;t stand hearing about vendors trying to rip people off and providing awful services.&nbsp; At least he&#039;s up front about only shipping twice a week, but then he can&#039;t even keep up with orders doing that?&nbsp; Sounds like the guy has too much on his plate or just doesn&#039;t have his ducks in order.&nbsp; Go with another vendor obviously.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a vendor take more than a couple of days to ship.&nbsp; Call me impatient, but I don&#039;t want to order something and wait a week for it just to be marked in transit.&nbsp;

				Yeah, he bulk replys to everyones messages with the same thing..<br />he cancelled my orders the day he said he was gonna send, on saturday. Now he is no longer a seller.<br /><br />And I dont think he&#039;s associated with HHorse, cause they actually respond to messages,, and were around before he was.<br /><br />ya never know tho,,, thank god for escrow lol<br />

				stay away from this type of scam it is becoming more and more come the whole BTC prices thing, well process your orders faster and get them out the door, if you wait 4 days to process and than a day or 2 to ship well no shit the price has changed but get everything out asap the effects especially by the bigger vendors are minimally felt, but i know atleast 20 ish people that have had that same BTC rising price message and to FE to help and all those guys were scammed, NEVER BYPASS THE ESCROW SYSTEM!!! once you do , unless you have something in your hand , you gunna get screwed everytime
