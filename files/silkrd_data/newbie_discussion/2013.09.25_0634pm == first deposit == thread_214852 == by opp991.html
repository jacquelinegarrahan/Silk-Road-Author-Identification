				So you&#039;re using your phone connected to your name, to buy drugs off SR?<br /><br />For them to show up... it can take 20 minutes, it can take hours.

				Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s an app, or if you registered... you name is now connected to where you transferred those coin from.&nbsp; Ergo, now it&#039;s known that you send coin to SR.<br /><br />Maybe you&#039;re not buying illegal shit this time... but maybe in the future you get a CD for some illegal shit, LE digs through all your records... they find you have a history of sending btc to SR.&nbsp; This is evidence against you when you go to court.&nbsp; It now makes your defense, that you have no idea why this package showed up full of drugs, much more difficult... plausible deniablity is your only friend, yet you&#039;re tossing him in the garbage.
