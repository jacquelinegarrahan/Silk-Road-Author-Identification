				I&#039;ve noticed many of my packages will have a tear/rip or a tiny hole in them, especially when ordering from over seas. Does customs insert miniature probe like camera&#039;s into &quot;suspicious&quot; packages to get a peak inside with out opening them? Because it seems like it.

				Depends on what country you are in.<br /><br />For example <br />In the USA they can not open anything without a warrant which can be obtained by a suspicious smell or something like a hand written address.&nbsp; There is a long list of suspicious criteria including fake return address,&nbsp; mail from certain country&#039;s, uneven weight distribution etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />The postal service will then use a chemical swab on the outside of the box to test for drug residue.&nbsp; If they find anything the package will be opened.<br /><br />In England customs can and will open whatever they feel like without a warrant<br /><br />But in your case OP, it sounds like the tear is from shipping.&nbsp; I have worked in shipping and the boxes can take a beating unless it specifically says &quot;fragile&quot;.

				Packages can get roughed up pretty bad in international shipping. I think that&#039;s 90% of it.<br /><br />Although, even if your country has legal protections against opening the mail, they don&#039;t apply at the border.<br />

				I was having the same problem here.&nbsp; All of my packages were having little holes poked in them, it looked like someone pressed the side of key against the package.&nbsp; Yet my buddy up the streets packages were fine.<br /><br />We went up to the post office and asked about it.&nbsp; They said none of their machines would do something like that and even said it had to be the driver.&nbsp; Gave a neighbors address so they knew whos route it was, then gave us the guys name.&nbsp; Ever since that day, no more poke holes!<br /><br />Good luck man!

				I&#039;ve had packages from the U.K. with little holes in them and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the customs checking them out. I didn&#039;t order anything illegal though.

				domestics hardly. but its upto the vendors to keep changing packaging methods. And customs from one another country do talk to each other and know what to look out for. sometimes they take dabs of your package and test them for the common drugs, h, c, mdma etc. so many variables depending on what country.

				seems like I got a box from cali once (small box) that had a hole in one of the corners.&nbsp; if its well packaged though, there shouldn&#039;t be a problem with this.&nbsp; god I love how you can get decoy packages sent.&nbsp; they don&#039;t even have to be sent to you.&nbsp; that would be some hilarious shit, send your neighbor a box of sand from Holland.
