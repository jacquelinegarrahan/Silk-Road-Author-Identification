				FE = Finalize Early.<br /><br />This bypasses the protections offered by the Escrow system. If your packakge never arrives, there&#039;s really nothing you can do if the seller themselves isn&#039;t willing to help. Make sure to do your part to ensure the package does arrive.

				Finalize Early<br /><br />Highly recommend against this unless you know what you are getting yourself into.

				Hon, it means look elsewhere....<br /><br />it also means, even though you can&#039;t post in the other forums, that you need to READ them - hell, just read the buyer&#039;s guide... they are there for YOUR benefit. <br /><br />DON&#039;T EVER FE on an amount you wouldn&#039;t throw away. kk, FE means &quot;Finalize Early&quot; and you&#039;ll have to do this for &quot;x&quot; numbers of purchases before &quot;x&quot; vendor will sell to you if you are a &quot;new&quot; buyer. So, the $180 gram of coke you want is NOT one you want to FE on.... buy some &quot;somethings&quot; else - digital goods, etc. that can be delivered and &quot;FINALized&quot; immediately. This will start you on your way to building buyer stats that will make the over-priced coke vendor comfortable in dealing with you. AND STILL DO NOT FE with said vendor - unless of course, you don&#039;t mind getting fucked. i&#039;m not saying you won&#039;t have a successful transaction... i&#039;m just saying you should be able to afford it if you don&#039;t. SR escrow is there for a reason and it has been supremely useful to me on the couple of times i had something go amiss - actually, it saved the vendors a headache as well. <br /><br />i am concerned that because you didn&#039;t catch what &quot;FE&quot; meant here in this sub-forum that you aren&#039;t familiar with PGP/GPG either... PLEASE for fucksake learn it and never use the road without it. Ever. PGP keeps us all safe, kk? <br /><br />i hope i didn&#039;t come off like a cunt here, i just feel really strongly about safety and ethics (yes, even when dealing with drug dealers and addicts and users and so on...) in any business transaction. Truly, i&#039;m sometimes a right cunt, but wasn&#039;t my intention here, dig?<br /><br />--blue
