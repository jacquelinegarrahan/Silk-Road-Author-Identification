				I was wondering if anyone has any experience with his Tar, compared to other vendors, such as purest.&nbsp; It is cheap, so I&#039;m wondering how good it is.&nbsp; Thanks

				I made an order from him on Thursday, but I haven&#039;t gotten it yet so I can&#039;t tell you anything about the quality.<br /><br />He marked it in transit on monday (3 hours before I could cancel it), and my express shipment still isn&#039;t here. I&#039;ve sent him 4 messages and he hasn&#039;t even read any of them yet. For that communication problem alone I can&#039;t really recommend him.

				TY for the info.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some reading on HeavenlyBlack, and I think my next order is going to be with him.&nbsp; You may want to look into him, as he has inexpensive BTH as well.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read it is really good quality.<br /><br />Needless to say, Will not be order from CharlieMustThrive.&nbsp; lol<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160076.msg1130946#msg1130946">Quote from: JSherman69 on May 15, 2013, 06:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I made an order from him on Thursday, but I haven&#039;t gotten it yet so I can&#039;t tell you anything about the quality.<br /><br />He marked it in transit on monday (3 hours before I could cancel it), and my express shipment still isn&#039;t here.

				MisterMcFeely is looking like a good one as well. Can&#039;t beat Heavenly&#039;s price though, especially if it&#039;s decent shit. Definitely going to give him a shot.<br /><br />Charlie is killing me tho man. The worst feeling ever is going out to the mailbox and being disappointed every single day for weeks.
