				Hi there. Just Registered Today and I&#039;ve got some questions and thought I would Introduce myself as well..<br /><br />I have been in the drug business since I was 16 selling mostly High grade weed(Hydro). I understand how customer service is what gets clientele. In high school, there was only a handful of dealers in my school, and Once I started I shut them down and had two schools on lock with about 100-150 customers; I started moving 1 oz a day, then 2, then QP&#039;s a day. With success comes along haters. I was jacked at gun point twice; once for 4 grams, and the other a Half Oz. I was also scammed by a connect once for $1100. I began carrying guns and ran a higher risk of police detection, especially because neighbors would notice what I would be doing. Ive switched houses usually once every 6-12 months. Until recently I was looking at a youtube video of Bitcoins, then ran across a video &quot;Bitcoin is backed by weed.&quot; I then learned about SR. <br /><br />I highly respect what you are doing, not only as an occasional user of drugs, but as a dealer who has seen it all..The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. I have always dreamed of being able to sell weed without dealing with the punks and thugs who come along with the game. I hate gang-bangers with a passion. They always rip people off and ore horrible business men. What you are doing is taking that threat away and giving the world a violence-free market which is what is needed. For that I salute you.<br /><br />Now the questions I have are these...<br /><br />1. How should I package my products to ship? I will be most likely shipping High Grade Dro, High grade Sina Loa Cartel Cocaine (One of my best friends is a Coke dealer, I never would even consider selling white if It wasn&#039;t for SR) and Possible Molly(MDMA).<br /><br />2. How do get actual cash for Bitcoins? In order to re-up I need to give my dealers cash, If all I have are Bitcoins, this would seen problematic<br /><br />3. What is PGP code?? Someone please enlighten<br /><br />Thank you for giving the time to read this, I hope to be a good partner in the SR community&nbsp; :D
