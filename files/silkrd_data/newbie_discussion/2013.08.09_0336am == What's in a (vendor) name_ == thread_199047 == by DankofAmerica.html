				Greetings, Patrons of SR!<br /><br />I&#039;ve finally gotten to a point now where I feel I&#039;m, at the very least, &quot;prepared&quot; to take the dive into vendor-hood. I&#039;ve been a consumer here for nearly 2-years now, lurking about and soaking in as much knowledge as possible. I know that it&#039;s an ongoing and ever-evolving process to be safe, secure and professional. But, to the topic point at-hand.<br /><br />As the topic title questions. What&#039;s in a name?; More specifically, in a vendor name.<br /><br />I&#039;ve started up and have sold two moderately successful small businesses in RL and I&#039;ve always thought that a large portion as to why they were successful was due to their catchy and/or memorable names.<br /><br />How do you all feel about this? Do you agree? Disagree? And if possible could you write a brief (or detailed, which would be great!) explanation as to why you feel this way?<br /><br />Best regards,<br />DoA!

				DankOfAmerica is a good name - it&#039;s memorable :) <br /><br />I don&#039;t go by vendor names, honestly. In fact, a lot of the vendors I look at/buy from aren&#039;t really related to the product at hand/drugs at all - and I&#039;m fine with that :)

				Product first name second. I used to buy drugs from a dude called Fat Dan. He was obese, sweaty, and had a horrible sense of humor but his stuff was good and the price right so I came back time and time again.

				I like DankofAmerica.<br /><br />Although, I know a few vendors that have &quot;Hash, dank, ganja, etc.&quot; in they&#039;re usernames and don&#039;t at all sell cannibis and on the flip I&#039;ve seen &quot;euphoric, speed, speeder, ice&quot; and other variants in usernames from vendors that don&#039;t sell speed or MDMA.<br /><br />As mentioned though, product first, username second.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t care if your name was &quot;IfYouBuyFromMeYoureAFuckingLoser&quot; so long as the product is of high quality at the right price.<br /><br />Best luck in your endeavors!<br />mC

				In terms of marketing and psychology a good name on your account will get you at least a few sales from people who are taken in by that sort of thing. But as it is stated here, long term customers stick around based on the product.
