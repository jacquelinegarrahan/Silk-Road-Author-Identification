				So When I deposited BTC 24 hours ago, 1 BTC was equal to $115 USD. Currently it is at $104 and still dropping... that&#039;s 11 dollars lost per bitcoin.. If you bought 5 BTC you are losing $55! And now by the time I get my coins, they probably will lose the value I needed to place my order.. Which means I have to deposit more into my account.. Which means I gotta go through this again? :( HELP <br /><br />PS: I would be posting in the discussion board but I don&#039;t have my 50 posts yet. I am close though!

				maybe DPR can make a site wide sale like he did after the attacks... or allow vendors to sell commission free so that the money we lose will be made up with the lowered prices, and he won&#039;t have to take money out of his pocket..

				I know it sucks, but everyone is going through the same thing. It&#039;s always a good idea to deposit more than what you think you&#039;ll need, especially with the fluctuations recently. I usually end up putting in 25% more than what I think is needed just to be safe. By the way, if you haven&#039;t seen yet, deposits have been pretty heavily delayed today: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156494.0

				The Bitcoin market is still pretty small. Allow me to explain: I&#039;m in it since 2010 and I already made some deals that greatly influenced the market value, you could say I had the opportunity for some inside trading (next time I certainly will be prepared to abuse this&nbsp; ;D)<br /><br />So the market is probably going downhill because the whole deposit problem. Maybe not exclusively because of this, but I noticed a correlation between SR and the BTC market value in the past. Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation though.

				I know its not the best soloution but if people can sit on their coins when they come through the value will surely go back up again as it has done in the past few weeks but i do realise its money just sitting there and not everyone can afford to do this&nbsp; :)

Right now Mtgox trading lag is around ~50s, which is pretty significant, and almost always corresponds to a big sell off. Also, a lot of the trade volume is performed by bots, which don&#039;t really have this sort of context for their decisions.<br /><br />Also, looks like the $100 floor just got broken.

Although I wouldn&#039;t say that they are seasoned investors with real world market experience per se, more like early adopters on a power trip.<br />Combine this with a lot of people who actually can&#039;t afford to speculate and start to panic sell should the slightest drop in price show itself and we have a pretty wonky market. This is just unfortunate timing probably, but I am pretty sure given enough time it will rise again. So if you use BTC to buy goods it is advisable to keep the time passed from acquiring BTC to spending them as low as possible. Unfortunately this is currently not possible and there really should be a warning on the main site by now before more people are going to lose money. I personally don&#039;t care I already made enough profit to sit back and watch the whole BTC market go up and down without worries. But i know there are people who simply want to buy stuff without having to worry about market values.<br /><br />So if you have the time I recommend just to wait - it may take some time but I am sure the course will go back up.
