				I&#039;ve been trying these out the last few weeks.<br /><br />Much to my surprise it seems percocet&#039;s (10mg) are best for me, tho I need to take a couple more roxies (15mg) to be sure.<br /><br />Percocet: nice warm feeling, confident and at ease and peace; ocycontin: similar but not as strong (same 10mg dose); roxies: very irritable and impatient on 7.5mg so took another 7.5mg and calmed down very nicely and was like a slight better percocet, so next time i will go for 15mg straight.<br /><br />It&#039;s nice the P is better as it&#039;s cheaper, though it does have acetaminophen, hence need not take too much in short time [i went for oxys and roxies cos they are absent of that.]

				i find they all feel the same. they are all just different brands of oxycodone with different release rates and the percs have tylenol included. <br />personally, i like the oxycontin best because i don&#039;t like eating them&nbsp; ;)

				all pills are definitely not created equal. depending on the country of origin and the drug safety laws there, the binders, the fillers, the age of the pills... a lot of things can make a generic pill nowhere near equal to one that is supposed to be the same milligram value. even pills left in the sun can lose potency quickly.
