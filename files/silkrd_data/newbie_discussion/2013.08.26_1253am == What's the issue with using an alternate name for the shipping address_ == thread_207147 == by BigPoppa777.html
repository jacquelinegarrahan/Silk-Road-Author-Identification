				I keep hearing throughout the forums that I should NEVER use an alternate/fake name for my shipping address. Why? If I use &quot;Current Resident&quot; isn&#039;t that a normal and secure way that isn&#039;t fishy? Please give me reasons and stories. Thanks!

				Your mailman knows who lives in the house. Its a unneeded possible red flag.

				What about a University P.O. box? It&#039;s USPS but on campus. USPS is supposedly the least checked (UPS, Fed Ex, etc.). Does anyone have any experience with using an alternate address like &quot;Current Resident&quot;? I know a lot of spam mail and subscribers will use this label. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want the mail traced back to my name on campus, so I figure an alternate name is a must but if someone can explicitly explain why this is a major no-no without a blanket answer I will quickly change my mind. Paying for an outside P.O. isn&#039;t a problem but I don&#039;t think it would make a difference in security??<br /><br />Please help me out this is driving me crazy wrapping my head around the why&#039;s.

				Your doing unnecessary things. The only emission of guilt would be signing for a package. But you are free to do anything you want and ignore advice from experienced people.&nbsp;

				Sorry Koenigsegg, because of the anonymity behind this site all I know about you is that your a newbie with 11 posts to this forum. So forgive me for not taking your word... Anyways signing for packages is a big deal when there is an illegal substance in it and you&#039;re signing for it on school/public property not a residential area. So, once again, can someone please give me a real answer and not a generic &quot;No, don&#039;t do it unless you&#039;re stupid&quot;? I see no issue with using &quot;current resident&quot; but everyone else seems to.

				Is your name under the PO box?<br /><br />By alternative name do you mean fake name or like a buddy&#039;s name?<br />Because if you are on campus, I assume a fake name would not make it to the PO box since campus has a list of students, etc.<br />If something doesn&#039;t match (Name and address) USPS can red flag it, the keep a close eye on the address and any packages sent to it.

I need to double check if they have my campus ID hooked up with the PO box, its USPS after all so they might not.

				&quot;Current resident&quot; on priority mail is pretty suspicious.<br /><br />A postal worker made a thread here that officially they are supposed to return mail not addressed to somebody at the given address.&nbsp; Now many postman don&#039;t care but then many postmen know the names so well that they sort mail more on name than address.
