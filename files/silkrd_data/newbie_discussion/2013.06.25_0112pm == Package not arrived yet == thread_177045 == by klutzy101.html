				Hey all! <br /><br />Have been a member of SR for quite a while now, but only just started using the forums. I&#039;ve never had a problem with any orders or delivery before. I placed an order last Wednesday, was marked in shipping Thursday, and still hasn&#039;t arrived (domestic 1st class). This was my second transaction from this vendor. I also ordered a couple things yesterday which arrived today, so am a bit perplexed! Messaged said vendor yesterday but no reply so far. What would you guys do? Wait it out a bit more? I really don&#039;t want my stats to go bad as have never asked for refund or anything!! Plus, I want my goods! :P

				The postal service has been royal f&#039;ing up deliveries coming from some parts of the country. Some vendors are experiencing weeks worth of delays in the postal service right now it looks like. Yet it&#039;s odd because others are getting 2 day delivery coast to coast. I guess wait it out is really all you can do?

				It is tough waiting. The first couple orders are the most nerve wracking until you build up a little stash so that the arrival of the next order if it takes an extra week or so isn&#039;t so bad. For sure usps has some stuff royally screwed up in some parts of the country. There&#039;s articles indicating that for some areas where they closed the sorting center, the mail (even local in that town/city) gets sent to a sorting center that could be many states away and then comes back, and other weird things like that.<br /><br />I try not to sweat it too much. There&#039;s pretty much three main things that could happen.<br />1. It arrives later than expected. This is still a good outcome; vendor might have shipped it late, but it could easily be usps being slow too.<br />2. It gets &#039;lost&#039; in the mail and never arrives. This sucks but such is life. Good vendors may reship or offer other condolences. But let&#039;s not forget it cost the vendor too, if they genuinely sent the product and it got lost, I really think if they go 50/50 on a reship that is plenty accommodating.<br />3. Vendor didn&#039;t actually ship it. Unfortunately that is life. Win some lose some. Mostly win provided you pick vendors carefully. If you don&#039;t FE you can always run it through as a dispute. Or if it isn&#039;t worth it to you to dispute just take the hit and move on. Life is short.

				Making sense of USPS delivery times is on a par with making sense of airline routes. Funny that since a lot of mail now travels by air.

				Thanks for your long response mcguire. I said domestic, but didnt specify it&#039;s the UK! I never FE because of this, and never had a problem before. This vendor is relatively new, but has a very high rating, and many transactions already including one from me which was no problem! I guess am just being impatient&nbsp; ::)
