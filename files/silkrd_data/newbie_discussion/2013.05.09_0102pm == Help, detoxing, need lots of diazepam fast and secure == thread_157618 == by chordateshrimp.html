				I have a few days before I hit Xanax withdrawal.&nbsp; I need at least 100-300 diazepam eventually, including enough to get by on for now.&nbsp; I understand there is a lot of cheap diazepam to be had in India, but if I place an order and it is seized, i lose not only the shipment, but the time spent waiting for delivery and then waiting on the &quot;love note&quot;.&nbsp; Some of the domestic shippers are fast, but expensive.&nbsp; My funds are limited for another month,&nbsp; I have enough for the bare minimum I need, unless the BTC value doubles again<br /><br />I guess I should buy enough US to get me through 2 India orders in case there is a problem with one?&nbsp; How long does it take to order from there, shipping to delivery and how long if you get a seizure notice from customs?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />CS

				Went cold turkey once.&nbsp; I was sick for weeks and eventually had seizures that required hospitalization.&nbsp; They ignored my alcohol dt&#039;s, and put me on dilantin to stop the seizures.&nbsp; My only relief from the alcohol/benzo/vicodin detox were three librium a day that I had to request each time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t sleep for a week, I had diarrhea from the diet (they refused to give me fiber so not to provoke seizures), and I shook for days.&nbsp; This was at the new, expensive private hospital in town.<br /><br />I could go to dozens of doctors.&nbsp; If I tell the truth, they will put me on a string of anti-depressants and let me suffer through withdrawal in the meantime.&nbsp; If I ever have to go there again, they will refuse to treat me for pain because I have an ADDICT stamp on my file.<br /><br />I&#039;d prefer to just follow the slow taper program I found while at home where no one will wake me up at 0400 to check my blood pressure for malpractice insurance purposes.

				lol at all in your head. I guess you have never been through a w/d from a physically addictive substance. Benzos are probably one of the worst things to w/d from, it can actually kill you, Opiates suck but at least you know you will live though it. When it comes to cigs or weed then i would agree with you, but you are way off when it comes to benzos.<br /><br />GL OP you can do it!!!

				Yeah, I get fired if I take a week off work to cold turkey in or out of rehab.&nbsp; It&#039;s illegal, but they find a different excuse to fire you because it was a hassle for them and now they don&#039;t trust you.

				I&#039;m only addicted to nicotin (thank God, bad enough), so I dont really can talk about other stuff. But hey, guys, who is the boss? Youre body or your brain? Fuck this shit, get over it, live is worth it.<br /><br />OP: Please go back to hospital, they will take care of you. Don&#039;t think about it, it&#039;s their job. Everything else is just fucking around with phantasy.
