				Hey all, just as the topic says, I&#039;ve received only 1 out of 5 overseas orders. Domestic are fine as all have arrived. Any ideas? Is this normal? Not sure if I should mention the country I&#039;m in :-X, so I won&#039;t. Lets just say it&#039;s far away. ;)<br /><br />What&#039;s the percentage of deliveries is normal from o/s? <br /><br />Thanks all.<br />Jack

				Guess it depends what country you are in ;) AUS &amp; CAN are said to be amongst the most difficult. <br /><br />I am in the UK and over 20odd orders have had no issues getting stuff in from overseas, including from so called red flag countries. <br /><br />Sounds like your probs best sticking to domestic.

				Hey fxr, thanks for the reply. Yeah I think you&#039;re right. Domestic it is. <br /><br />I&#039;m just curious if this is normal. I guess so. <br /><br />Jack.

				Its not normal to lose 4 out of 5 overseas packages. But I only know from my own experience in country.

				If you have not been scammed, then it seems like you&#039;ve had 4 packages intercepted by customs. If these are to same address, I&#039;d think about cleaning house. If we&#039;re talking large amounts, they could be building a case on you. I would definitely not order internationally to that address, I would personally not use that address for domestic orders either.<br /><br />When you believe people are inspecting and intercepting your mail, that is the time to stop ordering drugs in the mail.

				Thanks for the replies all. I will not be ordering anymore to this address. Even though the amounts are only minimal, 1 gram here and there, if 4 out of 5 haven&#039;t made it through then yes, my address could be compromised. <br /><br />Good advise. Thank you all.<br />Jack
