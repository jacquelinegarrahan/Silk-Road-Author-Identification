I already sent two messages, the initial message, and another one in case my initial message had been overlooked. <br /><br />No one wants to flood anyone with PMs. This is a good place for vendors without vendor status on the forum to come forth and put their hand up.<br /><br />I have some valuable information to share too. A user tried to extort drugs from me. He failed but his methodology would be of interest to other vendors, and so on.<br /><br />The charter DPR wrote up is awesome, and it needs to be put into effect starting with getting these vendors their proper vendor&#039;s status.

				As scout has rightly said inigo is the only person who is currently dealing with this and I am sure they have quite a lot to deal with right now. I can appreciate how frustrating it must be, especially for those of you who have been waiting quite a while already, hopefully it will get addressed soon.

All sales must take place through a vendor account, so you will not be able to sell anything until you get one. However, the bond is refundable once you meet its terms (which you&#039;ll find at one of the links below), which essentially means that a Silk Road vendor account is free!<br /><br />I would recommend that you read the SR Wiki - specifically the Buyer&#039;s Guide, and the Seller&#039;s Guide - to get a better idea of how everything works.<br /><br />SR Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Buyer&#039;s Guide:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><br />Seller&#039;s Guide:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br /><br />F.A.Q.:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions<br /><br />Bond &amp; bond refund:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Bond<br /><br />I would also recommend doing your research in the Shipping and Security forums.

				This is better then it was when I first came on the road.&nbsp; Vendors had to buy an account outright.&nbsp; The bond is likely to prevent scamming, and it seems like a very progressive and intelligent way to go about it.

The terms of the bond are set in order to make it harder for scammers to get a foothold. Please note also that your sales must total $1500 to meet the terms in order to get a refund.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid there&#039;s no other way to sell on Silk Road - all vendors must enter into the Seller bond before any sales can take place.<br /><br />Best of luck with it in any event.<br /><br />Libertas

				I&#039;m sure the 200 concerta would make $1500, I&#039;d just rather get there in 7 transactions of 7 bottles than 30 transactions (with 30 chances to get caught). I hope to solve my problems without selling, but I&#039;m glad to have this option.
