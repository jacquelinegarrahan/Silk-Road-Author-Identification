				As some of you may know, Litescape had recently offered samples of 2 products for testing. One was a batch of hash capsules, and the other was a liquid marijuana inhancer. I will review them both here starting with the hash pills.<br /><br />As I opened up my mailbox, I was plesantly surprised to see two padded envelopes sitting in the metal locker. Hurriedly, I rushed home and ripped them open. The padded packaging seemed enough to protect from any damage, but the hash capsules were put in another padded sleve. Unfortunately, they did not stay in the sleve during shipping, as they were out when i opened it; nonetheless the capsules came to me undamaged. The only other slight flaw was a lack of a vacuum packaging, the pills were in a small baggie. I had nothing to do for a few hours and, being almost dry on weed, I decided to eat the capsules. <br /><br />They hit me hard around an hour after ingestion, and boy when I say hard I mean HARD. Having a low tolerence to weed in the first place, and having not smoked in a week or so, I felt amazing after these pills hit my stomach. My entire body was buzzing, a feeling of a heavy indica without the grogginess or couch-lock, while I still had a euphoric time with a lot of giggles like a nice sativa would give. The experience made me completely ignore my arthritis as well, so they are great for pain. Overall, the high lasted around 5 hours, with another hour or so to come down. After the whole experience, I wasnt left with any &quot;burnt&quot; or exhausted feeling like I would normally get from smoking the same amount of mean green to get me THAT high. I had a great evening, and the pills put me in an elevated mood for the rest of the night.<br /><br />Shipping: 4/5<br />Communication: 5/5<br />Product: 5/5<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely buy from this seller in the future, especially if he improves his shipping (which I am sure is absolutely no problem). <br />Thank you for reading my first review and first post, I would love to hear feedback, and if anyone else needs revewing I will definitely be available.

				Mrneumann,<br /><br />Hey, thanks so much for the great review! I&#039;m very glad that you enjoyed it as much as I did! The first time I did it, I was amazed at how clean and relaxing the high was. I&#039;m very pleased to see you found the same results. Since you do not have enough posts to post this is in the Rumor Mill where my review thread is, I&#039;m going to post it there for you. <br />Again, thank you for the honest review, and I look forward to doing business with you in the future!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Litescape

				Youre welcome Litescape, I am glad to be given the opportunity to review your products! I will be sampling the enhancer tonight and will write a review later.<br />And to anyone who read my first review, the vendor assured me personally that the hash capsules should not be able to be smelled by dogs, and that it was just not cost effective to vacuum seal free samples, and that the real orders will be much more securely packaged. Regardless, my package came through no problems.

				Now for my review of the cannabis enhancer. It arrived with the pills in the same style packaging (and rubber banded together by the post office) from the same &quot;company&quot; sender label. The packaging was clean with no flaws in anyway. After I ripped open and dumped out the package, a brown vial fell into my palm. The labeling was clean, boasting the wonderfully creative title &quot;Everlasting Coughstopper&quot; a creative play on words from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That name became even more appropiate after I unscrewed the bottle and took a whif of the sweetly pungent aroma. Reminiscent of Willy Wonka&#039;s chocolate, the smell had notes of melted chocolate with a slight herbal aroma as well, like a very light sage or turmeric. The color and cosistancy also reminds one of a melted chocolate. The lid to the vial contained a useful brush applicator, like a paint brush; convienent for glazing bowls with this beautiful smelling liquid. One vial was amost as wide as my palm, and with the diameter of a penny, holding enough for many many bowls.<br /><br />I hurridly sandwiched the enhancing liquid between a bowl of ganja. A friend sat with me to share the weed and offer his oppinions for the review as well. Almost immediately after the first light, I noticed how hard you need to smoke it, and how gentle and forgiving it is on your lungs. The sticky liquid helps pack bowls tight, and doesn&#039;t allow for too much airflow, but it&#039;s okay because you can honestly take an entire lungful of smoke without so much as a tickle, as if you were breathing in air. The bowl also needs to be burned a little hotter to ensure proper vaporization. As for the taste, it leaves subtle herbal flavor, like incense or burning herbs. It isn&#039;t the most pleasant smoke, but the taste is more than bearable and it will be washed away completely with a small drink of water. The smoke from a stronger weed will also be efficient to completely mask the taste. But like I said, it is not an awful taste, and may even be a pleasant addition to their sweet mary jane for some.<br /><br />Lets talk about the high. One bowl split between my friend and I would hardly be enough to put me where I want to be. This was most certainly not the case when the coughstopper was added. Personally, I dont know if it was just because of the higher smoke intake to the lungs, or if it actually increases cannabinoid effenciency to your receptors, but I can assure you that it this product is no placebo. I did not tell my friend about it&#039;s effects other than mostining the smoke and easing pain on the lungs, and he was visibly more high than he would have ever gotten with a single bowl. In conclusion, I personally believe this product to be absolutely worth it; it will help save you money on weed by enhancing bowls, and will protect your lungs from the wear and tear of harsh dry smoke and coughing. Overall I give this product a 5/5 all the way around. An excellent seller with a unique and helpful product.<br /><br />5 stars all around for an excellent vendor!!<br /><br /><br /><br />Side notes:<br />1) Do not use with a one-hitter or anything with a very small bowl. It packs so tight using a dugout that smoking became almost impossible. Eventually I figured out how to smoke it, but it does not pack as cleanly as a larger bowl would have.<br />2) I smoked a small amount on a cigarette (I do not smoke cigarettes often) as well as out of a freebase pipe, to make sure it was not laced with anything psychoactive like synthetic cannabinoids. The conclusion I came to is that the blend alone is not noticeably psychoactive, though i had quite a buzz from the cigarette (it could have been from the nicotine alone, as my tolerance is almost none) it went away fast and felt almost nothing worthwhile from the freebase pipe.<br />3) Do not try to smoke with cigarettes, it is a messy waste of product and a cigarette. Overall not a good idea, but thats why I&#039;m reviewing, so others can learn from my experiences.<br /><br />I hope everyone enjoyed my reviews. If anyone has any questions comments or critiques, please post them here or PM me. Thank you for reading!
