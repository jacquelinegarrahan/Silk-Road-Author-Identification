				First i ordered 25i-NBome 800Âµg Complexed Tabs x10 from dovecot2012. It was put in transit on the 8th which was a sunday so he obviously didn&#039;t ship it then unless he just through it in the mailbox and hoped for the best. Next i ordered a gram of bud from Bashfulbetty and after like 2 days of it still being processed and a few messages i asked him to cancel the order and he did. saying he had technical issues. After looking around i couldn&#039;t find anything for a decent price or anything i trusted so i went back to bashfulbetty and bought 1g of Fine Moroccan Hash for about $16 total after domestic shipping. I was hoping the 25i would come in today but it didn&#039;t. Kind of slow for domestic but hopefully it comes in monday and bashfulbetty is able to ship my product on monday.<br /><br />With me luck.

				Good luck :) Pretty sure you will receive your goodies. My first order ever I ordered some hash but the vendor has started scamming people asking to FE. Few days later his account was deleted for being a scammer. Luckily i got my BTC back.

				I would highly recommend the vendor called &quot;Mom N Pop Stuff &quot;. Their Jack Herer is phenomenal, an 1/8th order weighed 5.6 gr and they have STELLAR customer service. They are what their name says, a real mom n pop shop. These are the unsung heroes of the world, letalone SR....&nbsp; Another good THC-related vendor is Quality Kings. Their product is super high-end dispensary stuff at about the same price you&#039;d pay if you were at the dispensary. Both are great assets to SR.
