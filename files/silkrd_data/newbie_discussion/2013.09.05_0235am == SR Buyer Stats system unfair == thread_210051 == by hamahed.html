				I have been using SR now for about 4mths and have made about 25 orders for nearly $2000. I had been making a concerted effort to keep my refund/AF stats to 0% but have just had my first refund. <br />My problem with the system is this. The one refund was not from an order that I claimed never arrived, it was an order I had made to a vendor that stated on his vendor page to be escrow friendly, but within 45mins of ordering, vendor accepted order then promptly requested FE. I would not have placed the order if his vendor page stated an FE requirement and as such refused to FE. No further communication was had from vendor and order eventually went to resolution. Vendor waited until within 4hrs of admin intervention before 100% refund.<br />I understand the system only records when an order is refunded and adjusts stats accordingly, but my buyer stats now suggest I claimed an order not arriving, when this is obviously not the case. Admin should be able to use discretion and award refunds that do not affect buyer stats in cases where transactions are cancelled after the vendor accepts the order but before order is sent. At no time did this vendor claim he had sent the order and the PMs clearly showed I had refused a request for FE(which is against SR policy) and vendor ceased all communications, ending transaction.<br />I feel cheated that after maintaining a high level of integrity through all purchases it is the idiocy of 1 vendor accepting my order before stating an FE requirement that affects my buying credentials. Especially when our community relies so heavily on a few numbers to gauge our level of sincerity. <br />Not happy DPR

				Sucks. For the future if asked to FE ask to cancel the order. If you get no response from vendor contact SR support. Don&#039;t leave it to auto finalize.
