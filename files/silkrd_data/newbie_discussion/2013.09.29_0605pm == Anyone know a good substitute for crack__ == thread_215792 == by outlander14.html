				As with all things I don&#039;t know much about I turn to the voices of experience on here. ;). So in my circle of associates a new question has arisen. Which is of course a good substitute for crack. The quality of what they can get, and what is has been cut with is horrible and none of them are trusting of getting things through mail go figure. Recently they&#039;ve had luck with A-PVP (wonder where they got it :P), as a substitute for cocaine. Which strangely enough they&#039;ve been honest with their customers to an extent telling them it synthetic cocaine. lol. Anyhow does anyone know something aside from meth that might allow me to meet their needs? I know A-PVP in crystal form is not it, and with some help from these forums trying to rock it is not the route either. Food for thought anyway. Thanks in advance. <br />

				More crack. Hah, but seriously though... I just had to move away from my dealers to get off that shit. I have no idea about all the crazy research chemicals to sub it for but I&#039;m willing to bet they can&#039;t be any better for you. Maybe someone more knowledgeable will reply. In the meantime, you can always check out Opiophile&#039;s forums. They&#039;ve got lots of info on stuff like that there. Just search for &#039;synthetic cocaine&#039; or something like that.

				Definitely none of the legal &#039;caines&#039;, tried cooking them all, and it was a waste of time.

				The hope for Crystal A-PVP was there for a moment but it vaped to fast, and my thought was that it&#039;d be the same with others RCs.
