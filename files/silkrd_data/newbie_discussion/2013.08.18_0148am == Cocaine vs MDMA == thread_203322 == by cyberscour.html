				what do you guys prefer the overall experience of, MDMA or cocaine, and why?<br /><br />I love cocaine, mainly for the fact that you can redose and keep the high going for quite a while. <br /><br />But MDMA is my choice. The high is so much more euphoric and the experience can last 6 hours at a time.

				I like both, but overall MDMA would be my pick. It just lasts way longer and is a much more enjoyable experience IMO.

				Depends on the setting.<br /><br />I only like to roll if I&#039;m going to concerts where I will be dancing. If that&#039;s not the case, then I never use it.<br /><br />I have done a lot of coke in the past, none really recently. Most common occasion was with friends before we go hit the bars, or after to sober up.<br />

				MDMA/and or MDA All day baby! Cocaine does not give me the &quot;extreme high&quot; feeling I get from MDxx compounds. I tend to use psychadelics more often then not though, I do not like uppity jittery feelings of cocaine or most amphetamine substances either my opinion could be biased. But I vote MDMA and I am going to predict It will win =) ...i hope

				I&#039;ve always been an MDMA fanatic, but I like a bit of the expensive too.<br />The thing with MDMA is that it requires a long weekend, or at least do it on a Friday and still feel a bit crap for work on Monday.<br /><br />You can have a bit of charlie of an evening and be OK the next day. Takes a bit of self control though.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t like about charlie is that it makes me paranoid, fearing the phone ringing, txt msgs, people seeing me in my house through the windows, etc. lol. I guess it&#039;s not really meant for sole consumption..

				MDMA anyday, although I only use it occassionally.<br /><br />Cocaine is very nice but its an empty pleasure, and if your not careful will turn you into an arse, i.e. I have been socialising in a pub/club with some of my mates before and they have all been being secretive and cagey, I just tackled them and said I don&#039;t want of your bloody coke, if i did I would have bought my own, not free load.<br /><br />In response to holamigo-<br />Try a nice line of ket after your MDMA sessions, it literally will disolve your comedown, I believe there is some research behind this, Plus side being the k-hole on MDMA is AMAZING!<br /><br />

				I agree with conflicted. I think coke can turn people into arrogant twats and the worst thing is being in a room full of cokeheads, cant get a word in edgeways. at least on M people are loved up and give you a chance to speak.<br /><br />either way i prefer the general feeling of mandy and use her on a fairly regular basis, not enough to put out the spark though.

				RE: Cyberscour,<br />Thats literally amazing mate, thanks for letting us know, We have always used K for comedowns, its a shame K leads to health problems when used to excess as its an amazing drug, in fact my favorite!&nbsp; <br /><br />As a follow on to the OP&#039;s post, if there was an option for CK (coke+ketamine combo), I would have a tough time choosing between that and MDMA lol!
