				Let&#039;s say, hypothetically, I had around 200 Concerta (Ritalin/Methylphenidate) pills lying around that I wanted to sell, but couldn&#039;t guarantee on getting a steady stream of more in the future, how do you think would be the best way to sell these using SR?<br />I wouldn&#039;t want to set up a seller account because of the supply issue, and I would much prefer to sell them at a highly discounted rate in 100&#039;s/50&#039;s, to move them quickly.<br /><br />Would I contact other sellers to see if they were interested in a bulk purchase? <br />I imagine established sellers will already have their supply chain and would be very wary of the risk involved in taking a shipment from somebody without established credentials.<br /><br /><br />What are your thoughts? Has this been done/heard of before?

				Wouldn&#039;t be worth it.<br /><br />You would need to spend a bit on vacuum bags and stuff.<br /><br />200 pills of Concerta is not hard to get anyway, you&#039;d be better off selling them to college students yourself.<br />And tbh, nobody with sense would bother buying bulk from somebody(I know I wouldn&#039;t) with no reputation.<br /><br />FYI: Adderall is not the same as Concerta/Rtialin. Adderall is Dextro-Amphetamine, Concerta/Ritalin is Methylphenidate. <br />BIIIIIIIIG difference.

				Thanks for replying, <br /><br />Note: Although I am aware of the difference in Ritalin/Adderall - I thought I would mention it as a reference point for anybody not familiar with Concerta/Ritalin. (AFAIK Adderall is mainly prominent in the US while Ritalin EU?). <br />Either way, thanks for pointing that out - in hindsight; that was a bad call. I&#039;ll edit the OP accordingly.<br /><br />I would be very cautious buying bulk from somebody with no reputation too, so I understand that it&#039;s a bit of a long-shot, however, I was hoping that having them at a &#039;heavily discounted&#039; rate would make the risk worth the reward for somebody so inclined.
