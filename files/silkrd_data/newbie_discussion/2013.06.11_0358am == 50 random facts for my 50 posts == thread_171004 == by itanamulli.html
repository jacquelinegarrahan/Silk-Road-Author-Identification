				The word “trivia” comes from the latin tri-vium, mean­ing the inter­sec­tion of three roads. In the Mid­dle Ages, local towns would post their news on bill­boards nearby that were at the inter­sec­tion of three or more roads, so as to max­i­mize the num­ber of trav­el­ers who would see it. Ran­dom, obscure facts that were picked up while trav­el­ing then became known as “trivia.”
