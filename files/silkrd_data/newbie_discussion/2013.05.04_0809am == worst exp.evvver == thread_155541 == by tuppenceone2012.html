				I did MXE everyday for a couple months.&nbsp; I used it for sleep a lot.&nbsp; I did ketamine everyday for four months and royally fucked my bladder.&nbsp; I enjoy them both.<br /><br />I did a ton of MXE while on a computer and I felt like I was lost in the computer windows and I was so confused and I guess I placed numerous bids on the most obscure items on ebay during this time.&nbsp; I woke up and found ebay windows on my pc and looked at my ebay history...&nbsp; Thank goodness I was outbid on everything.&nbsp; You would never believe the shit I had bid on.

				I fucking love 2cb mate, for me its like acid but with much more mental control. I find it easy to turn off the tripping or influence the trip with my own thoughts. Look out the window imagine anything and it comes to life as such, very very amazing experience. <br /><br />MXE however, is it really worth it then? or shall I just IM some really clean K? Never IM before but im starting to wondering if sniffing it for kholes is just a waste of time.. <br /><br />Jack maybe you can fill me in with the most effiecient way to Khole? As most of the time, I only get very small memorys of the Khole trip and spend more time confused than tripping.. although the trips Ive had are absolutely amazing, Ive read on erowid that sniffing really is a waste.
