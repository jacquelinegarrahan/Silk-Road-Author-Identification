				Hi,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve never bought a MoneyPak and the last time I bought a money order from Western Union was 15 years ago.<br /><br />My question is, if I want to buy say a $500 MoneyPak at Walmart, do I have to take the $500 with me to the store, or do I buy the blank MoneyPak at the Walmart and then load it at home with my credit/debit/paypal account?<br /><br />Thanks for your help.

				You take cash to the store to load the card with and there&#039;s an additional charge for the card use. So you would want to take $504.95 to get a $500 card.

				1. purchase money pack. bring like $20 extra to cover any fees/exchange rates/etc. you can buy them at cvs, walgreens, walmart, places like that.<br /><br />2. localbitcoins.com find someone that accepts moneypak and contact them via their preferred method. i text message my vendor.<br /><br />3. take a clear photo of the receipt + card number and send it to them once you have worked out a deal<br /><br />4. transfer the coins from your localbitcoins wallet to your personal wallet, maybe bounce them around a few other wallets, and then send them to your silkroad account. <br /><br />

				Bounce them around a couple wallets for maximum security? I doubt any of this can get linked to you. It seems most important to make sure your address is encrypted when giving it to the seller. Other than that this sounds like it should be smooth as butter with absolutely no paper trail. SAWEET. Thanks for your help!!!
