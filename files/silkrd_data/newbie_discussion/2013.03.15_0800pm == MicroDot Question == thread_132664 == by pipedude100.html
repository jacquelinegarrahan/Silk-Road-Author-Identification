				Was wondering if anyone has any experience with dots. Thinking about getting some from the vendor envious but dont know much about dots in general, so was hoping for some input. Would a 60ug dot give a comparable or better trip then blotter of the same ug.&nbsp; I am thinking that since they are the same strength ug wise then the trip would be the same but not sure if the fact its in microdot form some how causes it to be better.&nbsp; :D

				Taking a blotter with 60µg lsd or a microdot with 60µg lsd shouldn&#039;t give you any difference since you&#039;re still using the same substance and the same amount.<br />On the other hand, experiencing lsd is variable. If you&#039;re gonna trip with a microdot, thinking that you&#039;ll trip harder, there&#039;s a good chance you will, because the experiences depend on your mood and mindset.<br />

				Those dots that envious has are mediocre, look at the listings, even. There are much better options for LSD available from all over the world for a better price.

				Go with blotter unless you want to powder the microdot and snort it. You can probably find better blotter with more ug.

				tessellated has strong blotters with amazing packaging. envious is a reputable vendor but the price vs dose does not make it very cost efficient, unless you want the dots just for the novelty

				youve never heard of people sniffing lsd because its a ridiculous notion. its such a small dosage for lsd that to have enough of anything to sniff it would have to be full of cut material. if you were to have enough lsd to actually do a line it would be a massive trip that would last for days

				The only difference I ever noticed between microdots and blotter was that microdots would take a lot longer to come up if I&#039;d eaten that day.

				LSD works in a different way , than most other drugs.&nbsp; Once it&#039;s introduced&nbsp; it sets off a&nbsp; ( haywire) chain reaction in the brain&#039;s own chemical factory. The substance LSD itself is not getting you high, but is triggering a series of events that cause you to fry out. Even if you take it with DMSO you still have to wait that hour or so for it to hit you.<br />Stick it in your neck, plug it up your butt: it dont make no difference. if you try and smoke it: it turns into some type of sugar and is wasted.<br />

It might taste slightly metallic at times , but not bitter.
