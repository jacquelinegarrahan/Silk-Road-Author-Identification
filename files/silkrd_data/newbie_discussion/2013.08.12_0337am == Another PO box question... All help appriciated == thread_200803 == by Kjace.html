				Ok, so I&#039;ve looked into getting a virtual office to get my parcels shipped to since where I live is absolutely not an option, and there inst one even remotely close to me, not to mention its wayyy too expensive for the amount I&#039;m buying. <br /><br />So, unless someone has another option for me, I&#039;m gunna be buying a PO box. Now, the most I will ever order, as of now, is an ounce of herb. Now, I&#039;ve never bought an ounce off SR yet, but i was planning on buying a size 3 PO box which is 11 x 5.5 in.<br /><br />The next size down is 5 x 5.5 in and the next size up is 11 x 11 in which I think would be overkill. Now that i think about it, 11 x 5.5 in sounds perfect to also have a little security room. <br /><br />Just wanted to get a little reassurance before getting one.

				A flat priority mail envelope is 12.5&quot; x 9.5&quot;.<br /><br />Option 3 will be fine, but you are missing a dimension. It&#039;s 11&quot; x 5.5&quot; x 14.75&quot;. You could fit a few ounces of weed in that baby. :)

Just wasnt sure if the way most vendors packaged ounces if would have fit.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t find that last dimension anywhere, even on the usps site it only gives the first two for some reason. <br />

				Hey mate, it&#039;s ok if it doesn&#039;t fit. What they do is just leave a slip in your box which you take up to the counter and claim your drugs, lol. No need to pay extra for a bigger box but if you&#039;d rather not deal with that just get I think it&#039;s the third biggest. Sorry don&#039;t have the dimensions handy. Can I also suggest maybe not ordering a full ounce and maybe break it up into 2 or 3 packages. That&#039;s always safer in case one gets lost or gets seized w/e it&#039;s just a precaution.

				I just don&#039;t want to have to show ID when I&#039;m claiming my shipment, just in case of a CD. I was trying to figure out if it would definitely fit so if I do get a slip, I would be a little more cautious and be more aware of my sorroundings: looking for suspicious activity in the office etc.. <br /><br />And I would love to have it shipped in 2 or 3 different boxes but I don&#039;t think most vendors would go through that for an ounce. Idk, maybe they might.<br />

				I was also considering&nbsp; PO box to prevent anyone from my household opening my mail.&nbsp; Can anyone PM me on here with the risks of using a PO box? I won&#039;t be ordering anything stinky like weed.

				Honestly dude, I&#039;ve looked into it and the only problem people seem to have are these: giving your ID to the place and having cameras on you when you pickup. <br /><br />The way I see it is, your just treating your parcel like any other piece of mail. Depending on the quantity of your order, and what it is, you should be fine

				First time going to the counter is kinda sketchy after that you just walk up and say &#039;Where the fuck my drugs?&#039; No but seriously with a PO box or PMB you have more control of the situation. With your home address you do not. With a PO box you can bounce if the situation looks sketchy or your spidey sense goes off. If your not ordering pounds of shit or drugs come flying out of your package then it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Also if your vendor practices proper stealth packaging too. PO workers don&#039;t give a shit what&#039;s in your package if you don&#039;t make it their business or aren&#039;t already on LE radar.
