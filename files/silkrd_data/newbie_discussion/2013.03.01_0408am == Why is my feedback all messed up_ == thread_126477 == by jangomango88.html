				Hey, so I&#039;m pretty much a newbie to the road, done about 8 orders in the last couple months. Recently I placed an order and was told I would have to auto finalize due to my poor feedback showing that I auto-finalize a lot. I&#039;m unbelievably confused! I&#039;ve never let an order auto finalize and always finalize the second I get my product, no idea how the seller is seeing otherwise. What could cause this and how do I check my feedback myself? Thanks

				What elmo said.<br /><br />And sorry to reply with a Q but i&#039;m pretty new too - do you mean you&#039;re being asked to finalize early or asked to auto-finalize instead of whatsitcalled when it gets to 17 days and you either need to auto-finalize or &#039;resolve&#039; or whatever they call it? <br /><br />As far as I&#039;m concerned you&#039;re not supposed to ever finalize early. I never have and I&#039;ve only placed a few orders. See a surprising amount of people doing that in reviews but I think that&#039;s mostly international stuff... maybe someone else can enlighten us.

				I FE pretty much to boost my refund rate. I got a refund of a couple of hundred after a seller went rouge, but in doing so, my refund rate was totally raised so high I started seeing clouds. Also some internationals that are trusted require FE.

				Oh yea let me clear it up for ya.<br /><br />So yea he asked me to finalize early due to my poor feedback. His claim was that my feedback shows that I left things auto finalize. That means he&#039;s saying that after I receive my product I don&#039;t give the seller the money and instead just let it sit for 17 days and let it go to them automatically, which is completely untrue. I&#039;ve only done like 8 orders so it&#039;s not hard to look at. And no I didn&#039;t end up finalizing with him, cancelled the order instead but concerned if what he saw is actually on my profile. And now that I look at my buyer&#039;s stats thanks to you guys I realize he&#039;s full of shit, my stats say<br /><br />Total transactions: 8<br />Total spent: PRIVATE<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />So I guess case closed.
