				Was just wondering what is the longest anyone has waited for a UK domestic delivery? Recently placed my first order and it hasn&#039;t arrived after 10 days, despite being sent first class via royal mail. Is this suspicious or does this kind of thing happen a lot?<br />scraps1234

				I hope nothing serious is going on at the royal mail, but i have ordered from a very trusted uk vendor this monday, he states (and this is my experience as well) that uk mail takes 1-2 working days... well i&#039;m still waiting, my fingers crossed :(

				First class uk domestic does normally take 1-2 days, it can take longer however. I&#039;d allow at least a week or two before starting to get concerned.<br /><br />Weekends cause delays as there are less collections, no deliveries on Sundays and the number of Royal Mail staff on generally is I believe much lower than on weekdays.

				A few years ago I used to sell on ebay (not drugs lol), Royal mail then was excellent, more then 90% of my first class stuff came through next day, Now, at least in my area I would say its more like 60%, especially if posted on a saturday it will rarely if ever turn up monday morning anymore, coupled with the delivery times now being more like 2pm for me (used to be about 9AM). I suppose it was all part of the reduction in quality ready for its &#039;privitisation&#039; wait till you see what the service is like when its owned by greedy investors and the like!<br />P.s. I always find that if it doesn&#039;t turn up next day, it will more then likely take 3 days.
