				Before I go ahead I wanted to see if anyone can pick fault with these steps.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to purchase bitcoins, using a bank transfer (cash at the counter) then transfer those bitcoins into an inbetween wallet site then transfer those to my SR account. Then i&#039;ll purchase my item from a domestic source in a small quantity sending my details encrypted in PGP to the seller but without any details for them to contact me (email address etc). Upon receiving the package I&#039;ll write &quot;return to sender&quot; in red pen over the package and wait a few days before opening. <br /><br />Now is this the utmost I can be doing to stay secure?

Though you should not use any obviously fake names. No James Bond or Jason Bourne or Mickey Mouse - some sellers won&#039;t even send it. Also, even an innocuous fake name stands out if you never receive any other mail for that name...

				I would only add to take care to research the vendor&#039;s stealth methods. You wont find specific information but read the reviews and look for complaints about sloppy packaging, etc. If there aren&#039;t any then you&#039;re good to go. Read both the forum threads and the SR reviews.

				I personally think ~24hrs is an adequate time to wait before opening. If LE wants you, they are&nbsp; not going to wait around and twiddle their thumbs, they are going to be knocking at your door the second they KNOW you have it.. IMHumbleO

				what can you say to le if your real name is on the parcel but you write return to sender on it ?<br />If the door does not drop of its hinges within twenty minute you should be ok.
