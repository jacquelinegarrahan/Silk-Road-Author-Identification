				ok sorry guys I just really have to vent a bit here.<br />The only fucking reason why I order the crap from domestic vendors is because I hope it to be fast, actually I sometimes even hope it might get here the next day if it went into transit the morning before.. I don&#039;t even know who to be mad at but I&#039;ll just blame the post since it has happened every fucking time I&#039;ve ordered something from domestic vendors so far..<br />The order always takes like 2-3 business days to arrive and I know this aint much but I keep reading reviews like &quot;wow arrived after 1 day&quot; and I start to believe that the fucking idiots from the post thing are just too damn lazy in my part of the country and are like &quot;oh lets go home 10 mins early today I&#039;m tired&quot; and that&#039;s how I never get my god damn package in time. Seriously I have a lot of important things to do tomorrow and I gotta be chilled for that, I would have really appreciated if I had some h right now but nooo. <br />And no you can&#039;t just resort to the street shit from here, no way. If you let it sit for 1 minute too long half of it goes back into crystals that look like glitter mixed with sand its fucking disgusting I don&#039;t wanna imagine what all those people&#039;s veins look like from around here..Also you have to take like 10 times as much compared to most SR stuff and I don&#039;t even live in a small city or anything.. People actually say the stuff here (especially the h I had) was good, oh lord. <br />You can&#039;t count on anybody or anything it just keeps pissing me off every time it happens and its like 100% so i guess I should start dealing with the 2-3days domestically and 5-8days EU.<br /><br />UGH It seems pathetic and maybe it is but everybody who&#039;s fallen in love with that drug like me knows that this is just the thing you look forward to the most.. I admit I have a weak mind maybe I should stop giving in to everything and man up and stop getting myself into situations where I&#039;m depending on criminals and lazy, underpaid idiots and then get worked up if things don&#039;t show up in time or at all.. oh well<br /><br />AND ITS 40Â° AND NO THIS ISNT A COUNTRY WITH A NICE SEA AND REFRESHING WIND NO ITS JUST HOT FUCKING AIR ITS UNBEARABLE I HATE THIS COUNTRY<br /><br />ANYWAY I love you all, god bless this forum, I feel a lot better now. (too bad newbies can&#039;t post in the right sections.. &quot;newbies&quot; DO have important things to say every now and then.. like warning people and giving reviews and everything.. this is a rather counterproductive rule I think but ok..)

				2-3 days really isn&#039;t that bad.&nbsp; A lot of people have to wait upwards of 5-7 even when it&#039;s domestic.&nbsp; Maybe try ordering 3 days before you need the product?
