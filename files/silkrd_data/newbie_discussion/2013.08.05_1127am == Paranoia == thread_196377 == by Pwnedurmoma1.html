				Okay so as you probably realize, a lot of people get paranoid as hell when getting items shipped to them, multiple things could happen, the USPS could get a warrant and open it, it could get lost, etc. im just wondering if having someone else in the united states ship me a half ounce of weed (will not smell, whatsoever), im buying from U.G.S and im paranoid that the USPS is gonna get a warrant and open the box and then i get a delivery of an illegal substance charge, so ik this is stupid but could some of yall share some stories of either how you dealt with your paranoia or how you&#039;ve recieved a lot bigger shipments and been fine?

				There are members here who have been receiving much larger quantities of what you are worried about for decades. Long before SR existed the use of USPS to move product around the US was occurring. If you are nervous and want to get passed it, start with a smaller order? Or just take the dress off, change you tampon and place your order. You will be glad you did!

				I don&#039;t think you really have much to worry about with a half zip. The vendors with good stealth near 100% delivered domestically. Even QP&#039;s don&#039;t seem to be much cause for concern domestically.<br /><br />Here&#039;s something to consider, if you happen to live in a state that has decriminalized cannabis, maybe keep your orders under that amount. True, at the Federal level any amount is still criminalized, but for a small amount for personal use it&#039;s more likely it would get passed off to local LE. Then if the amount is decrim, maybe you just get a $100 ticket instead of getting charged with a misdemeanor.

				It&#039;s not an easy or simple thing for a postal inspector to get a warrant to open your mail.&nbsp; They need valid PC and then they gotta jump thru hoops to get the warrant. If your package arrives in the timeframe it&#039;s supposed to arrive in you can be pretty sure that no warrant was obtained. If your package never shows and then arrives 8 weeks late , then you might have cause to worry.

I&#039;m just thinking for small amounts even if intercepted and they want to come after you it&#039;s more likely to be passed off to local law enforcement than to have federal agents come to your door for a controlled delivery of that amount. (Except possibly if they are going after the seller and have reason to believe you have contact information/identity of the seller).

				It&#039;s normal to be paranoid when you first start receiving orders on here. However, when it&#039;s a reliable vendor who uses proper stealth, you really don&#039;t have much to worry about, especially if it&#039;s a domestic order. <br />

				pretty much as everyone has said, you&#039;ll be fine. an old buddy of mine receives LB&#039;s every month (domestic usa) of some really stanky buds, no questions asked. just remember to play it safe and take any precautions you can.

				Hey, first post! I&#039;ve been on SR for awhile, pored through the forums and had quite a few transactions though, so I&#039;d like to share a few thoughts on this and try to put this to bed completely. Sorry if it&#039;s long and didactic but since this is for newbs it could be very useful information for those who are paranoid. Also, I&#039;m talking here about the US specifically and many countries have much more rigorous standards so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to say that receiving product in the mail carries so little risk, at least domestically and in smaller quantities that as long as you take a few precautions you shouldn&#039;t ever lose sleep over it. Not to mention it is orders of magnitude safer than buying on the street.<br /><br />First, regarding what others have said regarding the amounts you are dealing with, I agree. Even the very rare packages that are detected and intercepted are usually just seized and at most they will send the &quot;love letter&quot; to the receiving address. Doing a &quot;controlled delivery&quot; (i.e. staking out your residence and nabbing you when you pick up the mail) uses a lot of resources and few local LE agencies, to say nothing of the Feds, are going to bother for anything less than keys of product. <br /><br />The main issue here is illicit substances being detected in the first place. By buying on SR you are placing a lot of trust in the stealth of your vendors, so doing research on sellers (as always) is one of the best ways to protect yourself. I have seen stealth from SR vendors that was so good I&#039;d practically walk in to a police station and sign for the thing without sweating. <br /><br />Another thing to consider is that domestic orders, provided the stealth isn&#039;t egregiously bad, virtually never get inspected (they would need to obtain a warrant to do so) International orders, especially from enthusiastic vending countries/known vendors (esp. from The Netherlands) get scrutinized much more closely, but still quite few of them get seized. For anyone new on SR, ordering domestically at first may be less anxiety inducing, and there are good domestic sellers for most products in most countries where the users of this site are concentrated.<br /><br />Many people have this image of postal facilities that includes DEA agents wandering around with drug dogs, inspecting and smelling piles of mail. The truth is these plants handle tens of millions of pieces of mail a day, all but the biggest stuff sorted mechanically and at very high speed, most of it barely being touched by human hands. Even if someone were to smell your weed, they most likely wouldn&#039;t care or they&#039;d be too busy to do anything about it (or they might take it home, of course!) The postal service (in the US) is also way beyond broke. They can barely keep the lights on, much less worry about coordinating closely with LE and opening your mail (again, they would need to obtain a warrant to open it) And there&#039;s also the fact that there aren&#039;t anywhere near enough LE personnel to search a fraction of this mail regardless. <br /><br />BTC. In order to convict you of a crime, I&#039;m pretty sure they have to prove you actually ordered and paid for these things. You have plausible deniability if they can&#039;t, especially if you have stuff shipped under an alias. Otherwise, anyone with a grudge could send anyone a big bag of heroin, tell the feds, and have their enemies sent to prison. They can arrest you all they want, which understandably could be embarrassing and inconvenient for you, but that&#039;s actually the simplest part for LE. Not having evidence of a transaction effectively means no dice for a conviction. Buy BTC for cash at localbitcoins.com, feed through multiple wallets and you should be fine on that end. <br /><br />Use PGP encryption for all transactions. There are a bunch of forum threads on how to do this. Of course, don&#039;t give out any possibly identifying info in the forums or in feedback. Remember to keep your TOR browser up to date. Block all java script and other add-ons. Using a good VPN in addition to TOR is also good policy. In reality, you are likely much more vulnerable to LE attention through a browser exploit or something similar which could expose your IP address and possibly more, than through having a piece of mail searched. <br /><br />TL;DR - The risk is almost negligible, with a few caveats. Take a few precautions and you won&#039;t need to sweat it, ever.
