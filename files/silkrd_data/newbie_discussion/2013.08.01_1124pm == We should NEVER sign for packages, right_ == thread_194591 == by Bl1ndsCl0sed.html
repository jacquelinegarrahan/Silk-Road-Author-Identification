				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Just placed my first order (from Capsule Corp!) who informed me that I will be receiving a Priority 8 by 6 box.&nbsp; I dont want to keep pestering them, so I want to ask here - will I have to sign for that box?<br /><br />I doubt it, but I just want to be sure.&nbsp; I know we should never sign so... 8)<br /><br />Thanks!

				ive never signed before, priority you wont have to im pretty sure, but with express shipping i think you have to, i know ill have to on an order coming this week for a large amount, kinda nervous about it, but ive talked to members before, and wouldnt it seem silly to get locked up for signing for a package, not sure if im correct but youd have to have it opened then they could get you for it, also i dont use a real name, idc what vendors say, i know that in my area, the usps doesnt check to make sure theres a person by that name living at that house,&nbsp; correct me if im wrong

				<br /><br />Signing for a package causes you to lose &quot;plausible deniability&quot;. This means that you cannot say &quot;who me I had no idea that was coming&quot;. <br /><br />I would never sign for a package myself.

				I have not had to, but a friend of mine, who orders international all the time, does. He said anytime a package comes from overseas, you have to sign for it. He set up a PO box though, where the people that work there sign for the package, and then when he goes to pick it up, he signs for it from them

				You wont have to sign for that.&nbsp; Only sign when you are expecting to sign.&nbsp; Do not sign when you are not expected to sign.
