				agreed absolutely...i know they are working on the issue since it at least went from not loading to stating it&#039;s under maintenance.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing when they resurface they will state they were under ddos attack or something like that

Even then, simply the frequency and &quot;network&quot; of emails together with the timing could tell someone running a compromised mailhost a lot.

				well damn that&#039;s a bummer...I hope that tor mail can somehow salvage their operation and bring it back up somewhere else<br /><br />regarding FH, I could really give a shit if it didn&#039;t involve a tor mail address that I use...the fact that he allowed child porn sites to run is beyond fucked up and he deserves whatever the hell he gets...CP is fucked up and those sick bastards can rot in hell in my opinion...that&#039;s one of the things I love about SR is that they don&#039;t allow that activity<br /><br />anywho, what&#039; I&#039;m really interested to know is how the slimebag was caught...I&#039;m guessing (and hoping) it was RL activity that got him nabbed and that they didn&#039;t somehow compromise tor to get him...anyway I&#039;m sure there will be more to follow in the coming days

				I would not reccommend using tormail ever again. Im sorry to say it but now that FH has been compromised it is most likely a honeypot. Use burner emails. <br /><br />Stay safe out there.

				well I certainly hope it&#039;s not a honeypot. I actually used it for some legit purposes so hopefully it&#039;s not. I have some BTC tied up in an account that is connected to that, so guess I&#039;ll have to send those someplace safe.
