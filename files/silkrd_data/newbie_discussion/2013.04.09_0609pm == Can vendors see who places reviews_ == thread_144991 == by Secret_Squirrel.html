				I guess I was just wondering about this, if we have a bad experience with getting something fake from a vendor and we leave a bad score, do they see a page with our username and our feedback so they can fix it or worst case get revenge now that they know we use silk road and have a name and address for us?

				I doubt any vendor will take &quot;revenge&quot; on someone who probably lives far away from them.<br /><br />From their perspective they have your money, if you don&#039;t like the product oh well plenty of other people do.&nbsp; Drugs sell themselves.<br /><br />Now if you some how screwed them out of money or product, maybe then you should worry.

				I would never give a good review to someone because i was worried about that or even if they threatened me. This place only works if we warn each other about scammers. I do an extreme amount of research before buying from anyone with the exception of my last 2 transactions which were very small amounts of money. I&#039;ve built my stats up over the last year too and have never had to go to a resolution or auto-finalized plus I&#039;ve spent alot. Unfortunately i did not take the time to post a lot other than to review purchases so my post count puts me as a fucking newbie in the forums. Resolving that now.

				Wow I was actually not aware that the vendors could see who posted the reviews. I thought they usually knew from order time or context. I was definitely misled there, as I seem to recall one vendor claiming they &quot;didn&#039;t know who left them the bad feedback so they couldn&#039;t resolve the problem&quot;. Definitely good info to know, although I have had no real issues thus far with any of my 20+ transactions. (Except for my most recent one with Oliver&#039;s &quot;oxycodone hydrochloride&quot; aka baking soda. First non 5/5 review I&#039;ve ever left.)
