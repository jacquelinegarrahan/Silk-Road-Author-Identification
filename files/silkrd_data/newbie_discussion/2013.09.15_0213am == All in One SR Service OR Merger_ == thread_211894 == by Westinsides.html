				I&#039;m sure some of you may also be asking yourself these questions but I would like to ask your opinion and open the following ideas up for discussion.<br /><br />I see three main key elements, Tor - Bitcoin - GPG <br /><br />Would it not be great for SR to create their own service for each? I cannot imagine that it would be so difficult with the help of the online community here. You guys are probably some of the most capable internet users on the planet. <br /><br />The other way would be to buy out the companies that are currently operating a good service in either field, or even potential merger deals.<br /><br />Bringing all services under one roof and brand as such would eliminate so much trust, security and efficiency issues that we all have on here. SR Bitcoins, SR Message encryption &amp; SR Marketplace seems like a great idea to me and would be top on my to do list if I was running the site. <br /><br />This said, it is my personal opinion. So please, indulge me with you thoughts and views, I eagerly await your responses.<br /><br />Westinsides OUT

				That is what many would call putting all your eggs in one basket. <br /><br />By doing my own GPG encryption I am upholding a fail safe in the case that SR becomes compromised. <br /><br />Regarding bitcoins, what are you suggesting? For example, by using local bitcoins I can purchase BTC from local dealers in person with cash anonymously and then tumble the BTC from LBC to my SR account to hide the trail.<br /><br />Also, what about Tor could be integrated into tho site more than it already is? As it stands I can download the Tor bundle and check the signature keys from the torproject website without any issues or worry of security.<br /><br /><br />I feel a huge aspect of security and anonymity is decentralization, the same kind of decentralization that makes bitcoin itself reliable. For SR to cover all these things I would be applying all my trust into one entity, which I am not comfortable with. As it stands now, if SR becomes compromised then the issue is relatively isolated. I used GPG on my own, LBC, and got tore on my own outside of SR. Convenience is never a worthy compromise to security and anonymity when it comes to this market. <br />

				All points well made,<br /><br />I agree with your final words &quot;Convenience is never a worthy compromise to security and anonymity when it comes to this market&quot; however this said all we have available to us has been a direct product of demand. The services available to us at the moment are wide and varied and full of scammers, phishers, hackers and clever users that will think of anything to get money from us. <br /><br />My idea is so that there is some sort of verification, an endorsement if you will from SR, which I think is the most trusted. I recently read the FORBES interview with DPR and he vaguely mentions there is a structure of staffing in place and being the main target of hackers and scams to the site itself, this makes them forever on top of the situation. It makes then constantly adapt. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m trying to say that we trust SR. The methods you use at present do not have to change. They could adopt the exact same processes using a network of BTC sellers of their own, even the same persons registering on THEIR network or service. <br /><br />I guess the other option, is one of the most simple. Make a page on SR for trusted sites for each service. <br /><br />I&#039;m just thinking out load so I apologies in advance for any ignorance to the systems in place.<br /><br />Once again your thoughts are appreciated and this conversation is open to all for agreement or scrutiny.<br /><br />Westinsides OUT

				Just to add to that and make it a little clearer....<br /><br />All services and processes need not chance. Run as separate entities it would not be &quot;putting all your eggs in one basket&quot; - Sr referrals or endorsements would be a great start. <br /><br />It&#039;s a jungle out there...

				Hi Cryngie,<br /><br />Please kindly elaborate on that response. <br /><br />I am of course no expert but I do know that usually where there is a will there is a way. Do you not agree that a program that gives you complete anonymity and gains users to the deep web including SR is a good idea?

				No I do not , this place is not for every bob and their dog. It is easy enough to get here as it is and keeping out the young kids and security risks is hard already making it easier to get here would just comprimise SR and eventually close it .<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why SR would need to endorse somewhere to buy btc a little google can find all the info you need. As for tor and pgp have you heard of tails if not maybe look into it

				I can&#039;t even.. :S So what you are saying is you want to make something illegal that&#039;s decentralised and uses legal technology, something illegal that&#039;s centralised using illegal forms of that technology..? I.e, giving SR all the power and in turn giving any potential hackers COMPLETE control over everything and also bringing more heat to SR from LE. Have you honestly thought what you just said through? The reason SR works and hasn&#039;t been able to be closed down is because it harnesses multiple decentralised anonymous technologies with an exponential number of anonymous users that anonymously interact and make deals without knowing each others intentions etc, i.e, buying BTC from a BTC trader who does not know your reasoning for needing the BTC and not part of the whole SR business, anonymously downloading TOR whos operators don&#039;t know why you are using TOR etc, if everything was SR this, SR that, it wouldn&#039;t improve SR it would destroy it, I honestly don&#039;t think you have thought this through properly at all.
