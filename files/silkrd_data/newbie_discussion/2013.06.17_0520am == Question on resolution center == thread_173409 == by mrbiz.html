				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am having a bit of confusion on what I should do about a small amount of product I recently purchased on SR domestically. It has been 16 days since I ordered and the product has not arrived yet and it is set to auto finalize in 4.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have communicated with the seller twice. The first after a week saying it would arrive in a few days, the second today saying he had to reship and it would be here be the end of this week also offering 5% refund for the wait.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My question is if i move to resolve now and request the 5% back am i stuck with that if it never shows? or is there an option to ask for a bigger refund in 7 days?<br />

Also, if he really did reship it, why did it not arrive the second time? Are you prepared to name the vendor, what is his rating, if it is 90 or below, then I would certainly presume he was trying to scam you! As I said, propose 100%, you can always reduce this if the other party does not accept it. If he has got a bad reputation, then the chances are that SR staff know this and will give you the 100% refund. I have had the misfortune to have a couple of transactions go sour and each time SR staff have given me the refund because it was obvious that I was not at fault.<br />Hope all goes well, in future, research thoroughly on the forums before you go with a new vendor- take their feedback on their page with &quot;a pinch of salt&quot;.

				You could also ask resolution to extend the auto-finalize.<br /><br />This way you can see whether or not the reship arrive, before finalizing or resoluting...

				Yes I would go with extending the auto finalise date so click on resolve and choose this option.<br /><br />I also agree with the other poster who said it sounds a bit shady that he had to reship.

				Thanks for all the helpful replies. I ended up extending the auto finalize date. The seller is googleyed, he has a 97% feedback rating and I saw some positive reviews in the forums when i researched him. But it is kinda of sketchy to reship without letting me know and the domestic orders are no longer listed.
