				I was using mtgox for the longest time, but they changed their policies, and I can only transfer to their Japan bank now, and they don&#039;t even give a sort code for it. And apparently they charge like 20$ to use the bloody thing. I went ahead and tried to verify my account, but apparently, even though I&#039;m in Europe, I&#039;m not able to use the European bank transfer method because I use GBP (I think?). So that was a waste of time.<br /><br />So, any UK lads (or lasses) here know a quick and secure alternative to mtgox? <br /><br />Non-bank transfer stuff goes over my head, but go ahead and mention a few if you like.

Obviously you have to pay a premium over the MtGox price, but if you shop around for the best sellers you can usually get a decent deal. Well worth it for the convenience, in my opinion.

				Yes local btc is a godsend after blockchain went tits up. <br /><br />Has anyone else found that most of the decent UK vendors have gone walkies now though? <br /><br />A lot have just gone, is this due to the btc issues with banks etc, you think or some other reasons? <br />

				I&#039;ve had a couple of things go missing international already so kind of prefer to keep it domestic, plus there is the wait around and the extra shipping and the higher risk! For weed I wouldn&#039;t bother but I&#039;ve good IRL links but for other things I need SR and it&#039;s a shame the UK arm appears to be crumbling so many vendors just disappeared! <br /><br />
