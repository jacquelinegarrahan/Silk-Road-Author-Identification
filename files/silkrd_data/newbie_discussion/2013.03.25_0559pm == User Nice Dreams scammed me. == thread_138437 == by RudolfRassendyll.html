				Hello<br />Wanted to give everyone a heads up. The seller Nice Dreams required me to FE for a purchase and never shipped the product and stopped answering my messages. If you look at his feedback he has apparently just stopped shipping his orders and gave refunds to those who didn&#039;t FE and didn&#039;t to everyone else, apparently. I have used SR on and off for about a year and never had a problem with anyone before. Unfortunately I lost my original PW (username was Raskal420) and had to start over, and he took advantage of that.<br /><br />If you order from him don&#039;t expect to receive your product, if you FE expect to lose your btc and not receive your product.<br /><br />Tried spamming to 50 to post this in a regular forum but didn&#039;t have the patience so hopefully if you search Nice Dreams you can come here and see NOT TO BUY FROM HIM, because he will steal your money.<br /><br />I will happily edit this if he decides to answer my messages which he has read, but I think it was a pretty calculated decision on his part and he&#039;ll just make another UN and start scamming again.<br />

				Yeah, I had never been scammed so I got complacent, but now I know.<br /><br />I wanted to check back in just to remind everyone user Nice Dreams is a SCAMMER. I&#039;m sitting her fucking dopesick because he didn&#039;t send what I paid him for. He read my messages and won&#039;t respond, won&#039;t attempt to resolve the issue. I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s going to use my btc to just open a new vendor account and keep up the spamming but still BEWARE.<br /><br />I thought no one would scam for suboxone because it&#039;s fucking evil to do this to someone, but Nice Dreams did it. He wouldn&#039;t even come clean and admit it when I asked him to so I could order from another vendor to avoid WD, he just wouldn&#039;t answer.<br /><br />Piece of shit vendor, scammer, shitty person.

				That sucks guys. Yeah NO FE EARLY asked me to finalize early after I didnt get my product so he would refund me... shit is fucked up. Then when he knows he&#039;s sitting on my money he just up and doesnt respond for 24 hours, ive been waiting over 2 weeks.<br /><br />Spammin to 50 because I have the free time and I hate my life.

				I am so sorry that happened to you. We ordered from one guy and it did not come, so he resent it and then the following day the original package arrived. I paid him for both, I think he sent the second lot with the first, but regardless he did do right by us. So sorry for your experience. Spam to 50 and report him

				Yeah what gets me is looking at this guy&#039;s feedback he is still selling and people are still finalizing early for him. I have reported him and don&#039;t even want my money back, I just want him banned. Someone who&#039;s gonna scam people for withdrawal medicine should be fucking beaten down. Nice Dreams won&#039;t answer me or anything anymore, he only sent me one message after getting me to FE and that was after I sent him five messages asking him what was up and ended up reporting him (which I told him would happen), and he said &#039;why did you report me?!&#039; Didn&#039;t even claim he sent a package or offer to refund anything. Guy&#039;s fuckin&#039; garbage.<br /><br />Luckily some other vendors came through for me so I only had three really bad days. Would give a strong recommendation to one eyed willie if anyone gets screwed by Nice Dreams and is sick...&nbsp; N2Void also came through.<br /><br />But screw this Nice Dreams asshole.

				The one reason I am posting here is to keep this at the top of the list.... anyone who would intentionally not send medication to someone who will go through withdraw without it is not fit for SR.&nbsp; Or real life for that matter..... <br /><br />
