				hi there - i&#039;ve been a UK SR buyer for nearly a year - every transaction faultless to date. BUT - an order of weed that was dispatched last friday 12th April - it was sent by recorded 1st class delivery. Nothing has arrived yet and when ive tried the tracking number it just states that the item is being progressed thru the network for delivery...when i have looked at the vendors feedback i can now see some really really worrying feedback just come in.....basically saying no stealth was used at all...before i ordered all the feedback was perfect.<br /><br />so my guess is that when the bitcoin crashed everything rushed to make their orders and this vendor must have rushed his packaging.........<br /><br />any advice please? :(

				ok its got even worse - just looked at this guys feedback again and he has 2 new ones from today:<br /><br />Weed came next day, the stone was good but didn&#039;t give the usual head a kush would. The weed weighed was 0.1 under and the stealth was non existent as it could be smelt through the packaging. User tried blaming everyone but himself. Be wary with this user, your taking a gamble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchased order and arrived next day, however there was no stealth involved just a piece of cardboard between a sealed bag. Weed reeked through the packaging. Mailed vendor to come to some conclusion, vendor blamed everyone but himself, The weed itself smelled great, few stalks and smoked very well. <br /><br />i can only post in the newbie section as ive only registered on forum recently...but shall i post this vendors info to warn others?

				Yes, definitely name the vendor!!<br />He really should be using better stealth-just kills me.<br />You should clean house just in case it gets intercepted and the police come knocking, and wait for the pack to arrive. It&#039;s only been 5 days and it was sent first class. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s still on the way-especially since that&#039;s what tracking says.<br />When you get the package and if you find that the packaging is insufficient, speak with the vendor about it and see what he says. If he&#039;s unresponsive or rude, there&#039;s not much you can do really except name and shame the vendor for his &quot;stealth&quot; methods.<br /><br />Always make sure you research your vendors before placing an order and never finalize early!!

				Clean house just to be safe. But hang in there. It will probably be ok. But always keep a clean house!

				I think it is absolutely your responsibility to name the vendor.&nbsp; Making others aware of the problem is integral to the purpose of these forums.

I&#039;d suggest looking at the vendor&#039;s profile for a more accurate answer, though -- most vendors specify their policy regarding refunds on their seller profile. If you can&#039;t find the answer there, you have every right to ask the vendor directly. <br /><br />I&#039;d highly recommend trying to resolve your concerns &amp; issues with the vendor in question through private message.

				sorry to say but clean house and cut your losses,i dont think u will get refund.it depends on vendors refund policy,if he states full refund or 50% or whatever it may be then SR admin should make him honor it.other than that dont expect to much.<br />definately name and shame,admin may delete his profil,but how hard would it be for him to make a new one.<br />send admin a quick note asking their opinion and then after u get reply do what u would want other buyers to do with a prick vendor like that.<br />good luck mate.

				still not arrived - and the tracker is just saying progressing through network - but it was posted last friday by 1st class - so should have turned up by now.<br /><br />vendor totally unresponsive now - 3 days left until i can go to resolution.<br /><br />what i really do not understand is this vendor:<br /><br />has been a vendor for 2 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 17% of sellers with 97.8% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br />has 139 fans - become a fan<br /><br />and yet there are 6 feedback posts all on the date of my order criticising his stealth?........so why would an experienced vendor fuck up like this?<br /><br />im not overly concerned about naming him because his feedback for the last few days has been perfect stealth...<br /><br />he does not have any refund policy - but the fact he sent it recorded and the tracking number is basically dead should give me some hope? or will i get fuck all back?<br /><br />
