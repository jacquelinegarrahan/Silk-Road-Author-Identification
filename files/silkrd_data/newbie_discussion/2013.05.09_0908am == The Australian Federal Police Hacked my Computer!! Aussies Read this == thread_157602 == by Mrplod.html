				Hello All,<br /><br />I have started this new account because a few weeks ago my established account was hacked by the Australian Federal Police.<br /><br />I logged onto SR and inadvertently forgot to log of TOR before I proceeded to my favorite porn site. The site is clearnet and from what I understand completely legal. (WWW.XHAMPSTER.COM)<br /><br />As you can imagine I was high as a kite so my judgement was somewhat impaired.<br /><br />Mid way through finding my favorite &quot;teen porn&quot; (as in 18/19 clear net legal porn) my monitor shows a message from the AFP. In this message they show my face (using my computers webcam) and my name/address.<br /><br />In the message it talks about me downloading kiddy porn which I can guarantee you I was not and downloading illegal downloads (that one is debatable). I didnt get a chance to read all the message because I turned off my computer.<br /><br />I have no idea whether this was related to my SR activities or not but one thing I can gurantee you is any &quot;evidence&quot; is long gone.<br /><br />I know most of you would say I should lay low but I want to warn my fellow aussie SR&#039;ers.<br /><br />If the Feds bust down my door they will find nothing and I have plenty of resources to fight them in the courts if need be. Not every drug user is on the dole or poor.<br /><br />Some of us run very profitable successful companies. <br /><br />Becareful Aussies. The fed is outthere and wants to fuck you up.<br /><br />I have done my dash and will no longer be apart of this community :(<br /><br />Long live SR AND DPR <br /><br />&nbsp;

				You can access sites in TOR whilst accessing other clearnet sites with another web browsers can you not? or does that post some kind of risk? I am a bit confused as to your post.

I know someone from Canada who had the same thing happen, where they would go on the computer and a RCMP letter head would come up with a picture (from their webcam) and personal information (pulled from cookies, temporary files, etc.) and they would be told to pay a fine. I&#039;m sure you interacted with something similar. In that person&#039;s case, they reset the computer.

That is why I didn&#039;t follow it. Just seemed a bit of an odd post. The incident he posted sounded like the MoneyPak virus, but the actual link he provided seemed like a virus as well. Because Google no longer enables quick view, it is not possible to look at it without visiting the site.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				It&#039;s a trojan called Reveton.
