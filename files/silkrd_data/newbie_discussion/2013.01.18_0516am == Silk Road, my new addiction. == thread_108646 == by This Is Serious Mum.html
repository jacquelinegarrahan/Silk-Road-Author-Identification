				no that was my real story but I have witnessed lives being destroyed by addiction hence is why I am probably more diligent with my habits. reason I only have 20 post is I decided to make a new account so that my sr buying account name wasnt the same as my foum one. I felt just a lil extra security wouldnt hurt since my other account only had reviews that i had done and would still have to make some bullshit post to get to 50..<br /><br />sr has afforded me the oppertunity to hustle a bit more taking the cost of my habit down to 20cents on the dollar
