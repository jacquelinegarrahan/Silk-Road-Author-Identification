				If you have your doubts, you may beable to stuff them. Not only am I fairly sure this shit isnt available for dload on the web, but the information in this package is virus free and very very convincing and promising. I can NOT say this is the same as other vendors make your own coupon kit, but I can say for fifty cents I really did make a KILLING. I WILL be reading, studying, printing, and using... Lets see how this goes! :D

				Ordered and will be comparing content of the package to information able to be obtained through search engines. Will give review of findings, quality of information, and effectiveness. Regardless, even if all info is available via search engines, it is easily worth the $0.50 to be lazy!

				Awww Coachella! Don&#039;t let one persons bad feedback get to you! Hell, you don&#039;t even know if they tried it out yet, or are a rival vendor who bought it and left the bad feedback in hopes of making you lose customer loyalty, and keep their clients depending upon them for updated coupon packs and whatnot, rather than being independent. This should cause you to offer even more if anything, in hopes of getting your feedback score back up to compensate!

				Nothing wrong with this kit at all.<br />Yes, *some* of it is available on the clearnet. <br />&nbsp;<br />But here you have the opportunity to get everything you need in one easy purchase.<br /><br />I dunno what people are moaning about.<br />A very good kit indeed.<br /><br />What people think of it when the price goes up, remains to be seen. Depends what the final price is I suppose.<br /><br />But yeah, the item is good. The seller is very courteous, and communications were excellent.<br /><br />If this vendor is looking to build a rep, this is the right way to do it.&nbsp;
