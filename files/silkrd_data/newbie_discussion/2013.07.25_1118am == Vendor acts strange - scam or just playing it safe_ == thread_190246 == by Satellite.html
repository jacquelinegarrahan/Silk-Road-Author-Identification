				Hey everyone,<br /><br />so I placed my first order on SR about 2 weeks ago. One week ago, I wrote a message to the vendor asking whether my package was shipped (it shouldn&#039;t take that long as the vendor is domestic). He replied that it shipped one day ago so I should be fine.<br /><br />Now, more than 7 days later, I received nothing, so I wrote another message. After telling me that he&#039;ll ask his partner for multiple times, the vendor told me that due to some problems my order was delayed and shipped yesterday. So this is the second time he told me it shipped yesterday.<br /><br />What is this? The vendor is top ranked and receives good feedback, so I don&#039;t really think he&#039;s scamming. Could it be that he&#039;s just playing things safe and not really letting me know when my order ships as I might be somehow trying to find out how he works? Or what else? Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers.

				Big vendors are usually run as a team... unfortunately SR doesn&#039;t provide the best tools for vendors, SR is technically status quo since a long time (in terms of the actual SR website itself...)<br /><br />Now I do know that big vendors have their own &quot;system&quot; of handling orders... and if it is a big volume vendor then errors will happen, that&#039;s just human. I mean, I don&#039;t know of any single legit business that does not have its problems and nevery makes any errors...<br /><br />Stay cool, wait a bit more and contact vendor again if necessary!<br />Cheers.

				you still sound good, but keep everything in escrow and DO NOT FE so if something happens SR admins can possible help if you have to resolve , but like stated above imagine how many different orders they are getting especially if they are a well recommended vendor i mean we could be talking 100s of orders a day, so mistakes do happen we are all human....but if he doesnt eventually come thru than yes but give it a chance...also link to vendor i dont think i seen it i want to check him out see what is going on just for my own information.
