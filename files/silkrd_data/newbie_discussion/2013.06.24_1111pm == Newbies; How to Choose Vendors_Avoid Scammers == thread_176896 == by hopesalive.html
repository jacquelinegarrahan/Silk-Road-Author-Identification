			<dd class="postbody">
				I was just reading a thread where a Silk Road member believes he/she may have been scammed.&nbsp; I thought it would be nice to have a thread (and forgive this newbie if there is already something like this) where we could make suggestions to one another on how to choose good vendors and avoid being scammed.<br /><br />This also gives me an opportunity to vent about something that bothers me about feedback on SR.&nbsp; I have read MANY reviews now, and it seems to me no matter what the&nbsp; review says, good or bad, the person still gives the vendor a 5/5!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Of course there are exceptions where many are honest and give lower ratings, but if a review contains negative information, why&nbsp; not mark it a 4/5 or 3/5 for those who just glance at numbers and do not read?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it, so if someone does, please feel free to illuminate me on this matter.<br /><br />Okay, now that I have that off my chest, I will share with you how I determine if I want to order from someone or not.&nbsp; (And remember I haven&#039;t placed too many orders yet or communicated with a ton of people yet, but&nbsp; enough).<br /><br />Vendors who promptly respond to my messages are automatically going to get my attention.&nbsp; Yes, I know all are busy, but&nbsp; if my message is responded to in a timely&nbsp; manner, I know the vendor CARES about customers and keeping me happy.<br /><br />Vendors who respond in a POLITE and PATIENT manner. I want my vendor to be approachable.&nbsp; The first person I ordered from not only responded in a prompt manner but&nbsp; put up with my nervousness and anxiety and so many (way too many) newbie questions that I felt bad!&nbsp; And the person said to not apologize for all the questions and they were happy to answer and to help me.<br /><br />Vendors who do not make me wait for three to four days for an answer. I was trying to figure out how to update feedback to leave feedback for this&nbsp; person: I would think that would be a priority, but it was not, and I had to figure it out&nbsp; myself. If I hadn&#039;t, I wouldn&#039;t have bothered to update my feedback.<br /><br />It is advised to ever FE, yet I did just&nbsp; that, because I was required to do so for an international order. Mine turned out fine, but I would not do it again.&nbsp; Use caution with FE. At least try to communicate with the vendor before doing so. You will be surprised how many people show their true colors through emails and PMs.<br /><br />Read ALL feedback. Don&#039;t just look at the scores/numbers: READ what people have to say and check back often.&nbsp; Take the time to go back a few pages.<br /><br />For myself, I am trying to stick to orders from my own country, because I don&#039;t want to add issues with customs to my anxieties.<br /><br />Well that is all I have for now. I hope you will add to this so us newbies can help one another.&nbsp; I will also post more as I think of more tips for all of us.<br /><br />I hope this helps even a few people!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Hope

				Good points but I disagree about the feedbacks. Leaving a 4/5 or less impacts negatively on the vendor&#039;s score and you may as well give him 1/5. If you get the product and it&#039;s good you leave a 5/5, or if there was an issue but it was resolved. Anything less that a 5 hurts the vendor&#039;s stats...

Why wouldn&#039;t you then leave a 4/5?<br /><br />I guess I would just strongly caution for everyone to read the posts, not just glance at the numbers then.<br /><br />Thanks for your input!

				Well maybe all those replies showed that scammer was TOO eager (and not busy filling orders).<br /><br />I have a question as a newbie: is there a list of scammers. Because I believe they should definitely be called out IF they are proven scammers and ones who do not resolve issues.&nbsp; How strict is Silk Road about going after these types and/or banning them from selling?&nbsp; Because I see some very negative feedback on one seller&#039;s page, even dangerous feedback, and the person still pops up on the front page?&nbsp; I will have to do some research on this, because SR should definitely want to be keeping us all safe. And we can also help one another do the&nbsp; same.

It&#039;s hard to trust, and I don&#039;t think any vendor should find themselves wrongly on a list of scammers. We have to trust that the SR mods are keeping an eye on things, and actively investigating scams or suspicious behavior, and that when they conclude a user is indeed a scammer based on evidence rather than forum rants, they will ban the account. <br /><br />You kind of have to take all evidence into consideration, and look for trends in feedback. Check other posts by a user claiming they were scammed. Have they been around? Do they seem sane? Or are all their posts angry rants or spam in the newbie section? They could be a troll, or someone with an ulterior motive. Make friends in the forums. Follow big threads with reviews of all vendors of your DoC. And remember what you&#039;re doing here...it wouldn&#039;t be totally safe on the street, either. Don&#039;t risk more than you can afford to lose.<br />

He knows where you live, and can choose to divulge this info to whomever he chooses. Much like the addage &quot;Be nice to those that handle your food&quot;, angering a vendor can be dangerous. Search the forums for &quot;blackmail&quot;, I remember reading a couple of scary threads.<br /><br />This behaviour is officially not tolerated... but by the time anything happens, it&#039;s too late. Remember, your vendor is not AS anonymous as you, your vendor is MORE anonymous than you.

				All excellent points above! And scary, too.<br /><br />Just to be clear, I have never bad mouthed a vendor, but I do try to be honest for others. On the first where I was a bit disappointed with product, I gave good feedback and PMed the&nbsp; vendor about it, cuz I thought it might be &quot;just me.&quot;&nbsp; The&nbsp; second I did mention in the feedback, but I again put &quot;this is just my experience,&quot; etc., being honest, not slamming the person at all, plus highlighting the good parts of the transaction.<br /><br />I do believe it is an excellent suggestion to balance all feedback because someone could write something bad over a grudge or just to start shit or whatever. After all, this is still the internet.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m very new and just made an order this past Friday. I had read all the reviews and searched the forums about the seller and it all turned out ok. The seller was keeping in contact with me over the weekend and I made a mistake with my pgp but got it all sorted out. Come today, I figured my order would have been shipped. Nope, still processing, and I haven&#039;t heard one peep from the seller. Not to sure if I should be worried about that or not, but I will probably cancel my order when the button becomes available. Last time I checked it said another 22 hours before I can cancel. <br /><br />Currently I have another vendor lined up if this one doesn&#039;t pan out. Hopefully I&#039;m just being impatient.

If everything is at lease kind of okay you leave a 5/5 and put the bad things in the feedback section, everybody ready the feedbacks usually. <br /><br />And there are threads where scammers are being called out in the rumor mill.. You can also just search the forum and see if there are people reporting being scammed by the vendor you chose, but as Waldo said, don&#039;t trust a newbie with 3 posts that screams scam, if it&#039;s from someone that&#039;s been around a long time and reviewed other vendors positively for example then you should be wary. SR staff does everything it can to protect buyers but it can&#039;t just remove all accounts so fast. If you get scammed you click on report and call him out on the forums, give him bad feedback, etc. (I recommend using a forum account with a different name and waiting a little while before leaving your feedback so he doesn&#039;t know it&#039;s from you). <br /><br />Usually though, if you don&#039;t FE, you don&#039;t get scammed and you should try the product before leaving escrow protection, if it&#039;s bunk claim the package never arrived or else the staff won&#039;t give you a refund most of the time (it&#039;s never happened to me but it&#039;s what I read).

That was nice of the seller to do so, but I was wanting it by this weekend and found another vendor that would send it out straight away. I however thanked the previous vendor for letting me know what the issue was and made him aware I was going to cancel my order and order from him another time. <br /><br />Hopefully that wasn&#039;t too rude of me to cancel my order, but I had plans this weekend.
