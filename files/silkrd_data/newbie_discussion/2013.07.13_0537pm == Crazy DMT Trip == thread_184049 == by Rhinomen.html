				I just wanted to see if someone could explain WTF happened...So a year ago me and my roommates stumbled upon a massive amount of dmt. We got to the point where we were doing it ALOT. For me every time I blasted off it was like I was continue this story and each time I had to see more.<br /><br />So after a few weeks I got really brave and loaded up 200mg (normally before I took off I had time to set the pipe down and get comfortable) hit it and next thing I know fully gone. The only thing that happened in my unconsciousness was this thing(keep in mind this is the first time out of over 50 plus trips I ever had a body or atleast a head and hand) and he had a red cube pill thing and he was holding it out. He told me it was this new drug called (dont remember) so naturally I grabbed it and popped it into my mouth.<br /><br />Out of no where another thing appears and tells me NOOOO you will never wake up. At that very moment I burst awake spitting and coughing with my heart racing. I setup and the visuals were so intense that it seemed like Styrofoam shapes were falling and filling my room up. Then I start hearing this Asian girl speaking in a Asian language over and over like the same 3 to five words. <br /><br />At this point I decided I broke it. What I broke I didnt know but it just hit me all at once this wave right in the chest and boom...I was still tripping hard setting there but all I could think about was how I would never be able to look my mom in the face again and how everyone would have to visit me in a hospital somewhere. I knew my girlfriend would leave me (not for doing drugs but for being crazy)all of a sudden I had this huge weight lifted (dont get me wrong im still tripping balls) and I looked at the alarm clock because I always take a mental note of when I first hit it.......it had only been 8 minutes and it seemed like a lifetime. I tried doing dmt a few times after that and would always get anxiety to the point I actually got sick so I&#039;ve never tried it since. It always seemed like wherever there was shadows something bad wanted me to go to it so it could get me. I finally just walked down our dark ass hallway (we lived in a loft with 20 foot ceilings so that added to the scary shit) and still felt anxious but finally felt like I beat it.<br /><br />My question in all this is...WTF happened someone once said Ego Death Ego Loss and do you think I will still be able to do shrooms or acid again. Do you think I disrespected the spirit molecule (what I am thinking i never once tried altering a trip...I think i got cocky and paid for it)This was prolley closer too two years ago now that i think about it.

				you had too much is what i think. disrespecting the &#039;spirit molecule&#039;? i don&#039;t think so, it&#039;s not like a molecule has any feeling or anything. you were just tripping very hard.<br /><br />

				You had a high dose and were unable to properly handle a high dose, your anxiety is purely linked to your expectations and worries of the trip, as well as the dose you take - not a &#039;decision&#039; of the molecule. Your future acid, shroom and DMT trips will probably be much more enjoyable with the understanding that you are a conscious being under their chemical influence but in control of yourself, not the other way around.

				I, like others, believe you simply had too much and you and your mind were not prepared.&nbsp; Anxiety is a natural response to that type of trip and now you have built yourself a sub-conscious connection to it as well.&nbsp; I would just make sure you are in the right frame of mind when using from here on out until you break that cycle of nervousness.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what else to recommend.

				That sounds like 80% of the DMT trips I&#039;ve had. 3-5 minutes battling demons that are getting to me in life, and 3-5 minutes of not giving a fuck, acceptance, crazy visuals like cartoon film clips. I have a very strong mind (i think/hope) takes me heaps to get drunk etc. <br /><br />The best thing you can do is tell your self, THIS SHIT WILL END JUST RELAX BRA, SIT BACK REMEMBER TO BREATH EVENLY AND DEEPLY AND ENJOY THE RIDE.&nbsp; (Always forgetting to breathe and getting red faced lol)<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever smoked it, the best kind(apparently) you can&nbsp; get from an acacia plant down under.<br /><br />One time i saw the mad hatter from Alice in wonder land dancing in front of me, coming closer to me through cuckoo clock holes in him self. Little air bags of him were popping out cuckoo clock hole size doors and forming more and more of his shape, then another one was dancing synchronized with him, behind him. When they were directly in the middle the behind one was hidden.. such synchronized dancing more so swaying with torso and arms from left to right. I could hear them popping out and they were speeding up, thought i was going to get suffocated by them.<br /><br /><br />As far as spirits molecules go, Once i did it down by a river, where all these river reeds grow. Reeds with one of the highest plant to dry matter ratio of DMT i know off, only very hard to extract without getting toxins and what not as well. (1.34%)<br /><br /><br />It was at dawn, no man made things around me par some fence wire. I swear to everything in existence that i felt mother nature tell me that the world is dying and that she was reaching out for me without words. I saw mud and grass at my feet, trees around me a couple of shrubs i saw the calmest water in the world i could see the wind moving as it touched my face, everything swirling around i saw the minds eye of every plant around me, Every plants spirit was moving as it would through out the entire day to reach the sunlight multiple times with in a few second. I felt that i could be absorbed into the mud, and that i currently had a place to go in the after life but that was dying with the world. I felt connected but i felt that i was being told this by all the natural DMT around me in the surroundings, i felt that this was a holy spot and they were fading fast and that something was coming that needs to be stopped.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t really done any since, life altering shit that dmt be i need to be in a happier care free head space before i venture in deeper.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Consider it a sort of &quot;test&quot; that you continue to start from the beginning because you cannot finish/complete it.<br /><br />Every psychedelic crisis is like a step into your personal &quot;initiation&quot;, but you must come to the end of the step for it to become such, not being stuck in the middle. Acceptance and letting go yourself it doesn&#039;t mean that you don&#039;t have to care to learn why it is actually happening and learn to overcome the cause of it happening. <br /><br />Sometimes you have also to fight actually (either during or after the trip), depending on the situation; sometimes you have to take your fears from the wrist and dance with them on the notes of an insanity/death&#039;s melody.

Maybe not next time, maybe not in the next 10 times, but sooner or later you will have to.<br /><br />It can also be that immediately you will try shrooms or acid again the thing will begin anew. In that case you have to resolve the cause of what is blocking you in yourself. There are many ways, the most cautions being the one of doing it in steps, by taking a very low dose and build up until the problem don&#039;t come up again. At that point with a good set and setting you have to understand what&#039;s the cause and how to resolve it.<br /><br />If you leave the thing as it is it will never change, of this you can be sure. Psychedelics are not dangerous, physically or mentally, in themselves, but they can surely become such, depending on the approach. Everything that&#039;s unresolved it&#039;s still there, it doesn&#039;t get away just because it&#039;s hidden atm. <br /><br />But naturally it can also be that in your particular case the problem was just on the pharmacology (the too excessive dose). It depends if the pharmacological problem gave birth to a psychological crisis or not and this you can see only by testing. In any case I don&#039;t see the point really to try these heroic doses (especially with DMT); there&#039;s no much to gain from them that a normal dose can not give you. Actually the more you progress the LESS a dose you should need, not the contrary.

				This only you can understand, by analyzing why your crisis is happening. It can be something to have within the trip itself or it can be something that has to do with your life, or it can be an internal fear of something inside yourself that externalize in the trip in a certain way etc. etc.<br /><br />There are multiple causes to why a psychedelic crisis happens, and the only one that can understand and resolve the motive of it happening is you. Just know that if you can do it you will be extremely thankful of the experience even if now you can think the contrary.<br /><br />The best trips (in the initiation sense) are the &quot;bad&quot; ones. They are like gear shifts in your engine. Without them you will be stuck in first gear all the rest of your life having to go max at 10 mph/hour (naturally there are many other ways to cause these &quot;gear shifts&quot; apart psychedelic crisis, but they always have to do with a crisis).

				i would suggest taking some clean mdma and then smoking some dmt whilst elated. it will almost certainly be a positive experience and hopefully will alleviate any subconscious negative connotations with tripping. haven&#039;t tried it myself as i&#039;ve only had positive experiences with dmt, but i&#039;ve heard from many people online and irl that it&#039;s a good place to start! best of luck!

				I&#039;m preparing for my first experience with DMT, after watching the documentary (the spirit molecule) on YouTube. Didn&#039;t the volunteer patients receive very high doses?&nbsp; I&#039;m building the machine and as a secondary option, the sandwich method (if I screw that up). I plan on the right set and setting. Thinking of a dark room with rain sounds? I&#039;ve always been a spirituality seeking individual. Astral projection, past life regressions and the paranormal has always intrigued me. I&#039;ve been reading about personal experiences on DMT and most seem, like a super strong LSD trip. There are a few that give me apprehension, like spirits/entities asking you to leave your body behind. I understand that your silver cord keeps you attached to your soul/body until death. I&#039;ve also have read that the spiritual world has a lot of trickery, like spirits/entities testing the limits of your knowledge on things. BlackIris has been touching on things, that I&#039;ve seemed to know from somewhere. That life/after life is a series of tests for spiritual/soul development. Do the Indians in South America use spirit guides? I really want to experience this spiritual journey, without the few bad trips I&#039;ve read about.
