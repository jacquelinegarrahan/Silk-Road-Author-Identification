				I found out about SR from a friend who was able to get some cocaine through from an international seller. When he told me how cheap it was I couldn&#039;t help but try and find out for myself. I don&#039;t see any point in buying domestically, in most cases the product is more expensive than my current dealer. <br /><br />I made my first order today for 2.5grams of cocaine from an international seller, I thought hat the small quantity would make it more likely to get through. I&#039;m pretty much only doing this as an experiment. Depending on whether it gets through, how stealthy the packaging is and what the quality is like, I&#039;ll consider bumping up the quantity next time.<br /><br />For those of you who have not received your international orders, what kind of quantity were you trying to get through? I spent alot of time checking the forum and reviews, however I struggled to get a real guage on what the success rate to Australia is like. Basically I concluded it&#039;s just a gamble really, hence my minimal initial investment.
