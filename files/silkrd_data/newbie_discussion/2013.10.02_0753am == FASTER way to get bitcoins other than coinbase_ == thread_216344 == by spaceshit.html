				Hey guys, I&#039;ve recently been using coinbase due to bitinstant closing down and I was wondering if any of you had any input on any other sights that might help me obtain bitcoins faster. It&#039;s always a pain when I miss out on a listing that I&#039;m really interested in because my funds are pending. Yeah coinbase gives you the privilege of purchasing coins right there and you get them instantly, but what&#039;s killing me is the 5 day wait for your funds to arrive in my coinbase account.

				While SR does have a built-in &quot;tumbling&quot; service. I am skeptical of giving coinbase personal info, atleast to get verified and bump limits asap.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have had good luck with localbitcoins.com , It can take a bit to get used to or seem really expensive, but if you post an offer of say 500$ ReloadIt card at bitstamp+9% you&#039;ll get seller&#039;s messaging you and you can save up to 30$ per BtC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve had success with direct bank deposit. It&#039;s been super fast with generally some of the lowest fees.&nbsp; localbitcoins.com also gets my nod for having a very good escrow system.

				Greetings,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to work with you going forward and I can offer a great rate, very easy transitions with btc, and be your trusted provider. I deal with either WU(more fees involved), or cash deposits at either Regions, BB&amp;T, or Chase account. All you need to do is post a cash deposit to the account I provide via email, email me your deposit receipt, and I&#039;ll send coins very quickly! We can arrange a good time so that as soon as you send me the deposit receipt, I&#039;ll be standing by and will send the coins at that very price of btc of the receipt. I am a vendor and am looking to help my fellow bitcoin aficionados achieve their needs and wants long term!! I also am taking moneypak at this time.<br />I am a professional and have been dealing personally and professionally in btc for a while now. <br /><br />Hit me up via email if you&#039;d like to work together: libertycoin@sefe-mail.net pr on my vendor account. Just a heads up, I might get the email quicker, as SR seems as though its always down momentarily throughout the day.<br /><br />Look forward to it!<br />

				Bitcoins allow people to obtain drugs from the comfort of their own home.<br />SR is often smoother and somehow cheaper than the back street.<br />Bitcoins are not, as far as I know, illegal to possess or exchange.<br /><br />There is room for dealer profit and user savings.<br />Reduced risk for everyone.<br />BTC win. SR wins.<br /><br />I know why olmate doesn&#039;t want to sell me bitcoins, but I also know some one or two less criminal types who could probably make a good bit for themselves.
