				Hey,<br /><br />I from France and I discovered SR by myself in February 13. Now I&#039;ve already spent 6000$+, mainly on hash and coke + some MDMA and LSD. Here&#039;s my review:<br /><br />the +:<br />- as a daily cannabis user, it&#039;s a great life enhancing: I was used to smoke B+ hash, A class very rare here. In SR I could find the best and most exotic hash produced on earth: premium Morocco, red Lebanese (and soon yellow Leb and Turkish cream thank&#039;s to Cloneuk), Charas, Filipino... Even if prices can be 2x what I find here, it&#039;s much better; <br />What I didn&#039;t expected is that best products are sold in UK, it&#039;s more expensive but there are genuine artist vendors there, hash can be much better that what you can find in coffee shops in Dam;<br />- as an irregular coke user, it&#039;s also a great life enhancing: I couldn&#039;t do coke in my city because of the poor quality. On SR I could find very good quality products although it&#039;s not easy and that I could find better products through real life trips;<br />- for MDMA I&#039;m happy I can find clean exctazy (well, I believe they are clean), I find very much nicer to take the product this way;<br />- I received all the orders I made (30+);<br /><br />the -:<br />[READ]<br />- 3 months ago vendor named Rails came with low cost coke wich appeared to be very nice fishscale; there was a guy named Marlon Brando doing pub for him and other good reviews; I bought 7g for me and friends, transaction was smooth and when I received the product it looked very good indeed and effects were there and strong.<br />But we all immediatly felt strange symptoms: pressure felt in brain, problem with swallowing saliva; I even went to a doctor but he wasn&#039;t worried about my case so I told myself: &quot;ok, it&#039;s just very good product I&#039;m not used too, it&#039;s all fine&quot;. I sniffed like 2.5g of it, sometimes way too much and I had some really bad moments.<br />So it&#039;s now more than 3 months from there, I had other coke since there but I&#039;m now clean for 3 weeks and I still can feel those symptoms almost everyday, they have never stopped nor decreased. I feel them more intensely when I smoke hash.<br />I&#039;ve no money to buy me IRM and hear a doctor say: &quot;ok there&#039;s nothing to do&quot;. I&#039;ve found similar symptoms by a coke user testimony on internet saying it&#039;s permanent cerebral sequels. And it&#039;s what I immediately thought when I realized they were there even when I wouldn&#039;t sniff. I&#039;m capable to live with it but it sucks. My friends took less of this coke and I don&#039;t want to talk about that because I&#039;m ashamed.<br />So I think Rails coke was a trash and dangerous product (you know coke is manufactured with very dangerous products, it&#039;s easy for the producer to miss his product), and that&#039;s why it was cheap. The guy Marlon Brando disappeared from the forum from what I can see.<br /><br />other -:<br />- I took way too many drugs since I discovered SR, sometimes fun but...<br />- I took LSD and I don&#039;t like it (but it&#039;s off topic);<br />- my hash budget has explode;<br />- I also had some mid grade hash sold as premium.<br /><br />conclusion:<br />- if you just smoke cannabis, SR is paradise and you can&#039;t go wrong (but concentrates and oils can be dangerous);<br />- for other product, SR can be a very good place but it also can be much worse than the street. Products like coke are dangerous, in street the guy you know wouldn&#039;t fuck with your health because you know him, he knows you, he will have correct product more or less cut with more or less nocive products, but he won&#039;t sell poison. In comparison SR is a wild place but I don&#039;t incriminate the site, I&#039;m responsible for my sort. <br />- my experience reinforce my support for legalization: dangerous products that people use must be quality controlled, it&#039;s a responsibility for governments.<br /><br />tips:<br />- do not buy cheap products;<br />- buy from UK;<br />- when you buy a potentially dangerous product, buy it from a very solid vendor;<br />- don&#039;t rely very much on reviews;<br /><br />best vendors from my experience :<br />hash:<br />- Technohippy: a few orders, all top quality (+ extazy / mdma);<br />- Atlas2012: a few orders, Rif and Manali are top quality products;<br />- Cloneuk: 1 order not received yet but he now offers the mythicals yellow Leb and Turkish cream and it&#039;s huge;<br />- Ganjaman: 1 order, made me try good hash from Filippines, how nice!<br /><br />coke:<br />- Bungee: 1 order, was pure but not the best coke I had;<br />- DrCol: 1 order, not pure but very nice;<br />- CharlieandMolly: 1 order,maybe cut with amphet or leva but very good for one night;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				saying Rails coke is manufactured with very dangerous products is BULLSHIT. <br />ALL COKE IS MANUFACTURED WITH VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCTS.<br /><br />you sound incredibly uneducated on the effects of chemically engineered drugs.<br /><br />take it at your own risk. your choice. stop bitching dude. you sound like a proper downer.

				I wrote:<br />So I think Rails coke was a trash and dangerous product (you know it&#039;s manufactured with very dangerous products, it&#039;s easy for the producer to miss his product), and that&#039;s why it was cheap.<br /><br />I meant exactly what you say: all coke are manufactured with very dangerous product, that&#039;s why it&#039;s easy for a coke to be harmful if manufacturing sucks.<br /><br />I may be uneducated, Im just trying to help other uneducated people, not bitching. I&#039;m supporting some damages, I hope people don&#039;t do the same mistake.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand your aggressive reaction. <br />
