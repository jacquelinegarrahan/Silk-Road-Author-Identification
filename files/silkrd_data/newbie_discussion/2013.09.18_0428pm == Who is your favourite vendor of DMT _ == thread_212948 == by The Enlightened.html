				Check out the Machine Elves.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Here is some of our recent feedback:<br /><br />&quot;Amazing!!! ego death, Machine elves I experienced them or me? there like a mirror of self arrrgh words fail.........Smooth the come up of this product Smoooooooth gradual like you melt away, nice taste too. Twice ive hit on this and broke through.. life will never be the same again and i love it<br /><br />10/10 beautiful stealth&quot;<br /><br />&quot;very nice dmt, it did send my buddy to the moon and back safely.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Good stuff. Weight is bang on / slightly over. I didn&#039;t break through but I was FUCKED UP at the time (benzos) and I came really close. I&#039;m going to do it properly next time (on a weekend, no intoxicants before, eating right, brief meditation) and I&#039;m almost positive that 50mg will make me see the machine elves.<br /><br />Basically... this vendor is selling the good stuff. I&#039;m going to buy more as soon as I can get hold of some more BTC. The price is great too (the best in the UK even, based on the quality?)<br /><br />If you&#039;re on the fence - don&#039;t be. Just do it&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE check out our profile page detailed in our signature<br /><br />We take pride in you being able to meet us ELVES in the DMT realm.<br /><br />You will NOT be disappointed, it&#039;s your PURPOSE ;D<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				for all things DMT pop here - Original Post contains some good recommendations on vendors as well as smoking methods: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0<br /><br />personally I really like MultiExciter and dmtnexus - products are very different, but both are very good.<br />RingoDS has been around for a while and I am yet to hear negative word about him.<br /><br />Be safe,<br />IM

				The best DMT I have ever had I made from root bark. It is really easy to do. The recipes are online, the ingredients can be bought easily and the process itself is easier than baking a cake.
