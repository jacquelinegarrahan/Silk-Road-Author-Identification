				HOw are you guys getting your bitcoin without verifying through like mt. gox or btstamp? <br /><br />most company&#039;s want lots of personal info to do transactions.. <br /><br />also is it safe to send directly from these companies mt gox and btstamp directly to silk road ?

				Mtgox doesn&#039;t always require verification. If you keep the volume of money flowing through the account at a reasonable amount, you&#039;ll be fine. I had 6000USD in there a month ago, it&#039;s all gone now, they never asked me to verify shit,and there are absolutely zero links to my actual identity. I just used a fake name and new email address. You should probably keep a few accounts that you use so as to minimize the traffic in each individual account. That&#039;s how to avoid verification.

				You can also use a service such as BlueSkyTraders.<br /><br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />As well as Bitinstant

				I&#039;m relatively ignorant on the subject of verification, so I&#039;m very interested to know if there are people who are more informed than I.<br /><br />How much traffic results in account flagging? Because I&#039;ve traded over 75,000USD worth of bitcoins in the past three months (daytrading results in lots of traffic) and they never flagged me.<br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering if it&#039;s worth creating a new account for each significant transaction to avoid the risk of account verification, or if I should do that now to avoid future verification. The decrease in transaction fees is so insignificant to a normal individual that it&#039;s not even worth considering as a benefit to keeping an account.

				I assume they flag less on day trading and when your working in their system... <br /><br />They dont like when you try to pull out.... they they want to know who you are and where its going.. I also think for a time they were verifying all new members to lock funds up for a minute... <br /><br />the cue was 22000 verifications.. it took me over 2 weeks before they released my funds imagine the type of interest alone you could make off 22000 unverified accounts assuming they started with 100 dollar investments... they held the money for a minute..

				Mtgox. I put several thousand dollars in mtgox (I gave the money to a friend of mine and he used his friend to get me btc. I don&#039;t know all the details), and then doubled my money through speculation. So I&#039;ve only sent cash to my mtgox account once thus far. I have also found another friend that I can simply hand cash, and he&#039;ll send me bitcoins.
