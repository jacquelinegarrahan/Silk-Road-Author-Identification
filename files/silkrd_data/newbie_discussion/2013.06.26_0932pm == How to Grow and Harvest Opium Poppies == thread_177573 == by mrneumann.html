				So I typed this out for a different thread and figured why not just put the information out there for all to see, so here it is, my (rough) guide on how to grow opium:<br /><br />The seeds for opium poppies are called Papavar Soneiaform (sorry about that spelling). They are available on the clearnet, through most nurseries, through vendors on the Silk Road (I can recommend the seller High Carts, he provides some professional, speedy comminication and Im sure his products will be the bomb) and even on the shelves at walmart as edible poppy seeds. The edible ones are hard to sprout, its better to get from online vendors. They can not be grown indoors because of their very deep tap root and the fact they are sensitive to climate and light cycles. To start the germination, shock the seeds overnight by laying them on a damp paper towel and put them in the fridge, they only sprout during a cold night so thats optimal conditions. Then plant them outside in manure or with other plants in a garden, wait a few weeks for sprouts, and once they all sprout kill all the small ones, leaving enough space for the ones with the most potential. If you dont weed out the small ones they will kill the bigger ones. Be sure all your plants get adequite sunlight and water.<br />Alternatively, you can fill a salt shaker with 1/4th seeds (non germinated) and 3/4ths sand, and shake this over your garden to ensure proper spacing. You will still need to weed out the small ones to give room for the larger ones to grow.<br /><br />After a few months they will grow 3-4 feet and grow bulbs (hopefully) as big as golf balls. Wait til these flower and after the petals fall off they are ready for harvest. Score them 1/16 inch diagonally across the bulbs, they will leak a milky white latex fluid which is opium. Leave to dry on plant for 2-4 hours, come back and scrape off with a spoon. This is smokable opium (though not pure). The bulb will then dry out, and can in a few days be broken off for seed collection and to save for opium tea. Seeds from the largest pods should be replanted through this method, while seeds from smaller pods can be made into opium tea, and the pods can do the same. Look up guides for this somewhere else, I might provide links later.<br /><br />BE SURE TO DISGARD OR HIDE SCORED PODS. The plant itself isnt illegal to posess but the scored pods will get you a felony, so dont have harvested opium planted in your front yard. What I would personally do is cut off the pods and keep them for making tea and collecting seeds. Other than that the flowers are legal and actually beautifully vibrant red. Good luck growing and harvesting!
