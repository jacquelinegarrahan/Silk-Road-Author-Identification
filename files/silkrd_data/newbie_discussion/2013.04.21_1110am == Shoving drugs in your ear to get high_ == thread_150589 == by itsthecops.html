				Sure ya don&#039;t mean in your rear, not ear? I&#039;ve heard of the rear thing, called plugging. I don&#039;t care how good it works, it&#039;s not for me. Ear??? never heard of it. <br />How bout ya take a very small drill bit and open up a hole in yer skull, just enough to sprinkle a little bit o drugs directly on your medulla oblongata?

				In theory you could through your eye, since there are tiny blood vessels. Depends on the substance though. Would hurt like fuck. Might as well just snort.<br /><br />If you put drugs in you ear you would just damage your hearing and not get high.

				Well, LSD works if you drop it in your eye(Not recommended seeing as most liquid could actually be something different that could potentially damage your eye), so I suppose some drugs might work in other strange ways.<br /><br />Really though, I like to just chew my pills, much easier than fucking around with other routes of administration as fun as they might be.

				I&#039;d assume this is completely dependent on your DOC but i&#039;d assume this wouldn&#039;t work.<br />As far as i know ears have a relatively poor blood supply and the layers of cells are quite thick as they are exposed and have evolved so as a form of protection for the body.<br /><br />There is however only one way to find out so why don&#039;t you try it out and let us know?
