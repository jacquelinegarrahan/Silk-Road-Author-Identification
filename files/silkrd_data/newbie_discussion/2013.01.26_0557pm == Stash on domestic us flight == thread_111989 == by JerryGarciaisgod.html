				Sticking it in something is a bad idea as these items are screened. Do not opt for a bodyscan . Opt for the patdown. If you are a girl you can place the meth inside something like your vagina. If you are a guy you might be able to get away with sticking it in your buttcheeks,if your a big guy,a smaller guy would probably have to tape it to keep it in place. test that method out walking around your house with it in place. try to walk normal. look confident. If it doesnt stay in your cheeks then either swallow it in a condum or three and shit it out. or stick it up your ass and shit it out . I wouldnt shit it out in flight. your hands might smell when returning to your seat. do not place it in the lining of clothing or your shoes. remember to opt for the patdown and the only way to be succesful is to hold it in your body somehow. good luck

				Don&#039;t hide stuff in your body.&nbsp; Hiding in plain sight works that much better.&nbsp; If you act nervous, you get caught that much quicker.

				Airport security these days is no joke. At my airport, there are constantly dogs sitting by the scanning area too. Not to mention you will have to go through a full body scan, as WELL as your luggage (not many people know this: Your checked baggage and bring on-board luggage are both scanned). <br /><br />I had this same conundrum with some molly. Solution? I just got high as balls before the flight, and then had the coolest flight of my life.

				If you can mail it to the location before flying that is the best option.<br />Make the mail look official. Use USPS.<br /><br />If you have get it on a plane:<br />Compression shorts. Seal it well and add a masking agent (i.e. shaving gel, cologne, pipe tobacco).<br />Place it with a substance of similar composition (i.e. sweetener crystals, rock candy, etc.) x-ray would see it in a tube of toothpaste.<br />I&#039;ve also heard, but not confirmed, that it&#039;s hard to detect in laptops.<br /><br />Friend of mine has gone through international to areas like the Netherlands and Thailand with rather bold amounts of MDMA successfully. Pointlessly, I might add, because he has either ended up buying local anyway (to sample the local wares as he puts it) or bringing it all back every time. He&#039;s just rich and bored. If he can pull it off then you certainly can.

Imagine trying to get away with that shit these days, no way that works.<br />In general I think flying with drugs is the worst option for getting them from point A to point B, mail is safer. I like to road trip and make a vacation out of moving larger amounts but for just a bit mail is the way to go.

				So I successfully made it with a half gram of crystal to my destination. Stuck it inside those wisp tooth brush things - they come 4 to a pack, 2 to a side. Stuck it inbetween the sides and resealed it. Checked the bag and it Even had a card from TSA inside the suitcase saying they looked in my bag when i got it at my destination.<br /><br /><br /><br />they also had a drug dog after the security check point today. it was kind of pointless as there was plenty of room to just skirt that issue

				Man, the TSA is a scary thing.&nbsp; I went through their checkpoint, complete with dogs, with a few OCs not too long ago.&nbsp; Now I know that dogs aren&#039;t trained to smell prescription medication, and I had hidden it well, but I was still thinking in the back of my mind &quot;I could be going to jail for a while if this doesn&#039;t work out.&quot;

				Damn, all this airport security is so tight nowadays. I remember one time when I was a youngin&#039;, for a domestic flight, I just double bagged a couple grams and put it in my sock. Got through no problem and was high as shit across the country the next day 8)
