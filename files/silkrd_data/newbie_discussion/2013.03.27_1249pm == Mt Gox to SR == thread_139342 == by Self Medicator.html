				Is it against the law to merely transfer BTC to SR? Since Mt Gox is cooperating with the gov, and since Mt Gox is requiring identification, doesn&#039;t it make sense that the gov knows the identity of every single person who transfers from Mt Gox to SR without using a secondary wallet or tumbler?

				Why not simply walk into mordor? Since it is so freaking easy to change wallet addresses, which lazy mind came up with sending directly from A to B...;) Just in case you are being monitored, it just would make it easier to get any evidence against you.

				Assuming you are in the US....<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The laws vary wildly from state to state, you would have to consult with an attorney to know for sure.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; 99% of the courts in the US don&#039;t have time to prosecute someone for putting money into SR (where they might just be buying a book :P)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; You ought to keep some Bitcoins in your Mt.Gox account, just as an investment and a thin facade to your true operations, and spend some on legitimate things (like gift cards: http://btcbuy.info/).<br /><br />4.&nbsp; When you want to transfer Bitcoins to SR, send them first to a free Blockchain wallet, then &quot;shared send&quot; (0.5% fee, breaks the chain of transactions) them to an Instawallet (instawallet.org) YOU MADE IN TOR.&nbsp; Then send them to SR.&nbsp; It takes a bit, but its pretty bulletproof.&nbsp; You could also use Bitcoin Fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) to break the chain of transactions, it costs more though (1-3%).&nbsp; If you wanted less security you could skip the Instawallet.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				In all honesty, unless you&#039;re buying or selling large quantities, I really wouldn&#039;t worry about it. It would take up to prosecution levels of interest for them to trance BTC. As long as you deny deny deny, and not do anything stupid like sign for a package when you shouldn&#039;t, than it will never get to the prosecution point.

				Well, first off, it would be hard to even track if you transferred money to your SR account because supposedly every transaction is ran through a coin tumbler. Secondly, I don&#039;t think it is &quot;illegal&quot; per se, but depending on what you plan to do with that money... is a different story. :) (I may be wrong though... seeing as this IS a black market... and it is created for avoiding taxes)

				l33tn355 is on point.&nbsp; No investigation is going to begin with the money trail (unless your buying keys of coke on SR and spending A LOT), but if you get caught with a package on your doorstep, having a clean record and an alibi for Moneygram transactions at your local CVS doesn&#039;t hurt.
