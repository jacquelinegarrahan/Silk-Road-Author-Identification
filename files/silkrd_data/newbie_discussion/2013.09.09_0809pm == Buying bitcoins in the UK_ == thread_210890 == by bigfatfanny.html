				Hi, I am totally lost as to how i get my actual cash money into bitcoins so i can buy from SR, I have seen things about how to do it in the US, but any info about Scotland would be good.<br /><br />This has probably been asked many times, my apologies.<br /><br />Cheers<br />

Go to the Rumor Mill subforum, and research the vendors. Also, if you&#039;re buying a popular drug, then there&#039;s probably a thread for that in the rumor mill (eg, MDMA has an &#039;avengers&#039; thread, as does LSD, and DMT has the &#039;deemsters&#039; thread).

				Hello guys, <br /><br />This might be a stupid question, but I rather ask than do somthing even more stupid..<br /><br />If I get my coins for cash via localbitcoins, is it fine to send them straight to SR from my localbitcoins wallet, or should I use the fog anyway?<br />Simple logics say, that coins bought for cash are anonymous enough &amp; there&#039;s no need for extra fees to be paid, but what are your opinions? <br /><br />Take care &amp; stay safe,<br />AP

Some of the stuff is almost as good as the pharmaceutical liquid cocaine my mates dad got when he was dying of cancer.<br /><br />If your worried about trackability or anything like that just use the Tails operating system for absolutely everything to do with your transaction. Myself though, I don&#039;t think the NSA/police wouldn&#039;t sacrifice the donut time needed to track people through Tor and bust them for buying a gram of coke. Well ... only if they&#039;ve run out of coke themselves and are really desperate.

				bitbargian is a decent uk site and quick, you can set up an account using fake id if you so wish but if not just fog the badboys. there is no escrow so there is a degree of trust involved but the sellers are all ranked.

				i seem to remember having to provide photo id and address info to regester but just used fakes. quick bitcoin cash transfers and no agency fee&#039;s even if the sellers are usually selling at the higer mtgox value....still cheaper than my first forray onto buying.

				What exactly do you mean by &quot;jumping them around&quot; - using the fog, or just sending the our from a new wallet address each time?<br /><br />Also, can I make a few different wallets adresses on localbitcoin, put some coins into each of the address and transfer to SR from let&#039;s say 3 different &quot;wallets&quot; or that doesn&#039;t make any sense if I&#039;m using the same localbitcoin account?<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />AP

Just use bitfog - it&#039;s easier; they explain it all on their site.<br /><br />Oh ... and remembered this page which has some out of date lab tests of Silk Road vendors for coke/speed most of whom are still in business (you can also dig the results out of the forum).<br /><br />http://braqrsskizlusigz.onion/<br /><br />I&#039;m looking down that list of lab results and some fond memories are coming back. Damn you&#039;d think I&#039;d be at 50 posts given the amount of 70-90% pure speed I&#039;ve taken.
