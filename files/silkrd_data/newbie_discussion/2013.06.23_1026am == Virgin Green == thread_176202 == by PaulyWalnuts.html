				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/181d292190<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/89e4b8ef40<br />Ok, so obviously I&#039;m a newbie.. Lurked for a couple months before committing to an order &amp; BTC. After I decided to purchase some H, I placed an order for the exact amount of BTC needed &amp; continued to transfer into my SR wallet. One thing I didn&#039;t realise was the transaction fee of .005 BTC, which made my order of BTC drop under what I needed. SO I thought &quot;fuck it!?&quot; and ordered another lot of BTC, this time is was the minimum amount of $20. Did the whole re-transfer into SR wallet, etc. By this time BTC had fluctuated and my original order had dropped to .89! &quot;Fuck! I should have just waited&quot; I thought, but soon realised this was the nature of this beast, and really, all we&#039;re talking about here IRL value is about $5-8 totally negligible amount really in the grand scheme of things..plus now I have some spare BTC to do something with.. So not really a drama at all.<br />So I find some weed &amp; organise a small amount, only to have the order cancelled &amp; refunded because, in my total newbie-ness, I selected the wrong packaging option. The vendor PMed me to explain that he cancelled the order for selecting the &#039;free post&#039; option, and that I could replace the order with him, but will need to pay an extra $4 for post on top of $25 for weed. As I didnt have enough BTC to cover the postage option - plus it was too late in the day to go deposit anymore cash at the bank for more BTC, I decided to find another weed vendor who could send me some weed to go along with my H. I stumbled across this guy http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/89e4b8ef40 who had 5 fans when I placed the order &amp; 7 transactions @ 100% which I took as being a good sign, and placed an order for 1g. That was on Thursday 23 June &amp; the order has been &#039;processing&#039; ever since. I PMed the vendor the next day when I noticed it had been 24hrs &amp; still no &#039;in transit&#039; and I also asked that he cancel the transaction. I explained that I really wanted to place an order by Friday so on Monday I&#039;d get some weed with my H. No response from him since. I messaged Customer Support, but knowing that there were time-frames that needed to be adhered to before they can get involved, they wouldn&#039;t be able to do anything for a few more days. It&#039;s Sunday night &amp; the the order is still &#039;processing&#039;. I&#039;m worried that he&#039;ll just wait until the deadline for shipping is nearly up &amp; then mark as &#039;in-transit&#039; to get more time before Resolution team get involved. From what I&#039;ve read though, this sort of thing isn&#039;t uncommon on SR, and basically I&#039;m just suffering from first-time anxiety &amp; imagining the worst,etc.. BUT! there&#039;s a few alarm bells that have rung for me about this guy over the last 3 days.. I usually suscribe to &quot;Occams Razor&quot; when determining the truth &amp; what leaves me perplexed is the amount of money involved. Her hasn&#039;t even sold enough to cover his vendors account &amp; his actions seem opposite to what he states his intentions are.<br />tell me what you think..<br />*had 5 fans on Thursday &amp; 7 transactions, now has 2 fans &amp; 10 transactions - WTF? something fishy going on there considering all the feedback is 5/5 &amp; basically blowing smoke up his ass - I shit you not! Nearly all mention how quick &amp; stealth it was. Also appears some people have had deliveries over the weekend aswell. Again, WTF? And I&#039;m pretty sure most people would find the writing style to all be similar to eachother &amp; his own profile. Just the punctuation, the phrasing of things, certain verbal flourishes<br />*vendor for 25 days &amp; has sold approx 17g (7 x 1g, 3 x 3.5G from what I recall) - is he buying his own stuff? I can&#039;t see anything on any forum about this guy..<br /><br />Whether he started it up with the best of intentions or the worst of intentions, whatever it might be, I think he&#039;s personally gotten lazy or somethings happened to make him think &quot;fuck it - not worth my risk/time/effort/bandwidth/karma&quot;<br /><br />If anyone has any advice or insight please feel free to share. I&#039;m not really worried about losing anything in the long term, as escrow is in place &amp; its only about $25 in the real world - equivalent to 2 pints at my local pub haha - but with all the attention Australia has been receiving the last few weeks I can&#039;t help but feel something untoward is happening - whether it&#039;s collection of data for LE or something else.. just doesn&#039;t sit right with me how he&#039;s paid money for a vendors account &amp; this has happened, plus he also states on his profile that &quot;I will attend to each order ASAP - as an eager businessperson would.&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s also a bunch of links on his profile that makes him look sus also..it&#039;s almost like he&#039;s cataloged all the dark-web stuff he&#039;s found out about LOL&nbsp; I certainly don&#039;t think they needed to be shared with anybody who&#039;s successfully made it into SR anyway. Opinions? <br /><br />

				Well it&#039;s not that unusual for vendors to take some time before sending it and marking it in transit, maybe he couldn&#039;t send it friday and he can&#039;t ship on the weekend so he&#039;ll probably be able to ship monday. You can cancel your order if it&#039;s been processing for 4 days though...

				I&#039;m very stoked you replied to my question Tree, I thought being stuck on the newbie board wouldn&#039;t give me much exposure to veterans like yourself.. I wanted to +1 you but can&#039;t/ don&#039;t know how to do that.<br />Yeah, I think I&#039;m just stressing a little bit too much Tree &amp; looking into things too much. I guess anything could&#039;ve happened, from a natural disaster to vehicle accident, family death.. <br />But did any of it look suspect to you? The 3 fans dropping off is the biggest worry for me.. what happened for them to not want to be a fan any longer? Or did they delete their accounts &amp; the fan status went with them? That I understand, but for 3 people who supposedly don&#039;t know eachother to do that with the same vendor is very dodgy. <br />Maybe the were done by LE &amp; decided to remove all links to him once they got out on bail? Or maybe they were just fake accounts set up by Virgin Green themselves that they have shutdown since for not wanting to be connected.. I dont know.. brain hurts thinking of possibilities<br />Can&#039;t wait to hit that &#039;Cancel&#039; button - but it&#039;s gonna screw my stats, right?<br />

				I&#039;m not a &quot;veteran&quot; at all! :P I only have a lot of posts but that doesn&#039;t mean that much. Well honestly I don&#039;t think it looks dodgy, I&#039;ve looked at his profile before answering and nothing looks weird or suspicious to me.. The fans getting out is maybe because they just weren&#039;t satisfied with the vendor for some reason. Maybe because he doesn&#039;t answer PMs, and he didn&#039;t answer yours according to you. I don&#039;t think those 3 people unfanned him at the same time though but yeah then it would be a little weird but I don&#039;t know what LE would want to do with fans honestly... <br /><br />The most plausible reason is that they didn&#039;t think he was interesting anymore and had too many fans already and decided to remove the ones they weren&#039;t interested in anymore or something. Worst case he&#039;s a scammer but none of his feedbacks states &quot;refund&quot; or anything similar so it&#039;s also unlikely.<br /><br />If you cancel your order you get your coins back minus 4% if the order was hedged, if it wasn&#039;t you get the full value back and it also doesn&#039;t affect your stats at all.

				hi PaulyWalnuts<br /><br />I realise this thread is a bit outdated but I only just stumbled upon it. <br /><br />Firstly, THANK YOU for being the first person other than myself to mention Virgin Green in the forums.<br /><br />Secondly, I&#039;m sorry to hear that you felt very anxious placing an order with me but I&#039;m glad you got it OK. I do remember you PMing me 24 hours after you ordered. I truly do my best to get the orders out quickly, but because of all the annoying packaging involved I usually just ship a few times a week. If you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll have your order shipped next day. But you may have to wait 2, tops 3, days before its in the post. Ordering on weekends is the best.<br /><br />Thirdly, I will be coming back online soon. Keep a look out.

				Hey VG,<br /><br />Yeah I was a little anxious as it was one of my first orders on the road &amp; was stressing out a little too much. I sincerely hope you weren&#039;t offended by anything I wrote. If you were, I apologise.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for you to re-list. Some of the best bud I&#039;ve smoked in along time &amp; the price is excellent too :)<br /><br />For all those others who haven&#039;t tried VG - you won&#039;t be disappointed! A1 stealth &amp; A+++ bud.<br /><br />
