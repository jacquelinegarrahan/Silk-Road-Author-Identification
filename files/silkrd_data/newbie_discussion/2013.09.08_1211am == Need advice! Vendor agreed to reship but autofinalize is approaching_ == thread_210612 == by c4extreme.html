				I unfortunately received an item that wasn&#039;t as advertised and the auto-finalize is coming up for that order in a few hours. I discussed it with the vendor and he/she was very honest and helpful and offered a reship, but I don&#039;t believe it was sent out yet.<br /><br />Should I finalize the first order anyway? Once you finalize, do you have to write the feedback right then &amp; there or can you come back to it and write it later? I&#039;d love to put out a great review for this vendor but I&#039;m not sure if I should continue to hold off on it. What exactly does auto-finalizing mean and how bad is it to let it get to that point? Will I still be able to leave feedback if it does autofinalize? Hoping you guys can help me out!

				Autofinalizing is bad because it makes it seem like you don&#039;t come back on to report that you got your shipment.<br />Finalizing early puts you at risk of not having the SR escrow service at your back if the drugs fail to show up multiple times.<br /><br />What you can do is open up a ticket with the resolution center, and suggest a 7-10 day extension for the vendor to ship!<br />This solution is desireable for everyone, unless the vendor has asked you explicitly to FE (I still wouldn&#039;t do it)

I wasn&#039;t sure if it was needed since I pretty much resolved it with the vendor already through PMs but now I understand it&#039;s needed for the actual finalize date extension. I don&#039;t mind handing the payment over(since I technically did receive the package, just not exactly what was described in the listing) but I wanted to be able to write a fair review for the vendor. Thanks! Now I just hope the resolution center receives the request and is able to grant it before the time is up.
