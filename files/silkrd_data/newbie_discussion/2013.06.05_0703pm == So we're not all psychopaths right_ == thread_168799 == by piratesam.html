				&nbsp;I&#039;m am new, and I&#039;m sure like most newbies with a conscious I&#039;m left here wondering if I&#039;m doing business with a bunch of psychopaths or not. I&#039;m sure most vendors are good guys, but what about the people who will hunt you down for leaving bad reviews? I&#039;m sure police are a bigger concern than other regular users right? I&#039;m sure these questions are asked a lot. I can&#039;t lie saying I&#039;m not a little worried, seeing as the only thing between me and a violent drug dealer is Tor.<br /><br />&nbsp;BTW, any tips on increasing personal security? All I use is Tor to stay hidden but I have herd that Tor alone isn&#039;t very good, and that I should maybe have some other line of security? Thanks<br /><br />~PirateSam<br />

				nah, its all good. the people on here are worried about money. and the only way for them to get your money is to offer you a good product at a good price, and all with a smile (or a smiley, since its the interbutts).<br /><br />its a free market here, so the people aren&#039;t psychopaths. only when government gets involved do we all suddenly see the psychos coming out of their holes.

				Doubtful.<br /><br />Unless the said psychopath became a vendor in order to scam people.&nbsp; This person would be found out pretty quickly and banned, so not much sport in that.&nbsp; <br />Otherwise, the complexities of selling would be far more than a psychopath would want to bother with.&nbsp; <br />Much easier for the psychopath to find a live victim to parasite and destroy than mess with online faceless buyers whose upset could only be measured by ranting messages. <br /><br />I doubt that anyone on the Road carries enough weight to merit a visit from a vendor slighted by a review.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t worry SO much.&nbsp; <br />
