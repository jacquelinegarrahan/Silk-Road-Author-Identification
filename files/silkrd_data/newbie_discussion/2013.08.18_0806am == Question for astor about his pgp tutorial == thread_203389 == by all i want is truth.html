				Personally I&#039;d just download it through a non-tor web browser.&nbsp; gpg4usb is pretty popular especially since the wiretapping news has come out and even people don&#039;t even know what tor is are downloading it.&nbsp; So grabbing that isn&#039;t going to really give away why you&#039;re using it.<br /><br />Downloading stuff through tor is typically fine so long as you trust the source of the file.&nbsp; (puts on tinfoil hat) it&#039;s easy to tell that you are coming from a tor exit note (there&#039;s a public list of tor exit node IPs out there) and someone being mischievous could then give you a special gpg4usb that the first thing it does it install a virus or something.&nbsp; Now is that possible? yes. Is it being done right now? don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Again I&#039;d just download it without tor.&nbsp; If you do use tor I would recommend switching your identity before hand just to make things a little less trackable.

				If you aren&#039;t connecting to a site through SSL, as dotgoat says, it&#039;s entirely possible for all the data you receive and see in your web browser to be tampered with.&nbsp; I think he downplays the risk though -- without SSL, it&#039;s trivially easy to do: it would take all of 15 minutes for someone to write a script that selectively replaced downloads with malicious installers that included the original download link&#039;s data so that you&#039;d never even notice.<br /><br />Well, 15 minutes may be an understatement... more like an hour or two I suppose.&nbsp; Not including the malicious addition to your download, of course.&nbsp; Also, the Tor browser automatically uses SSL if it&#039;s available -- but whether it&#039;s available at a given site for a given program I can&#039;t comment on.
