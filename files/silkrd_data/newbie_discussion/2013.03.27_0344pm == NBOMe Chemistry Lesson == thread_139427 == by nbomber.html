				Title: <strong>NBOMe Chemistry Lesson</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I was reading through an old-ish thread (which is now locked, which is why I&#039;m starting a new thread instead of replying in that one), and I came across some confusion about NBOMe chemicals, specifically Mescaline-NBOMe. So, for your newbie reading pleasure, I now present a crash course in the chemistry of the NBOMe series:<br /><br />The most common NBOMe chemicals are the 25X-NBOMe series. These are directly derived from the 2C-X series with a relatively simple process, which is a large part of why they&#039;re so cheap: drug producers can create a far more potent product by adding only a couple extra steps, thus multiplying the number of doses by... well, by a lot. While the process is simple by organic chemistry standards, it&#039;s still quite technical, so I&#039;ll give you the layman&#039;s version: 2C-B ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2C-B-Chemdraw.png ) is converted to 25B-NBOMe ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NBOMe-2CB.svg ) by sticking a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group onto its nitrogen atom (N).<br /><br />I have come to prefer an alternative naming scheme: Rather than call them 25X-NBOMe, I prefer to call them 2C-X-NBOMe, as this makes it clearer that the chemical is a 2C-X with a BOMe stuck onto the N. This naming scheme is used by Erowid, and I think it&#039;s for good reason. I don&#039;t even know where the &quot;25X&quot; whatever comes from. I don&#039;t care. The other way is better. Ideally, I think it should be written &quot;N-MeOBe-2C-X&quot;, but I suppose that&#039;s not quite as catchy. Whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is that &quot;NBOMe&quot; on its own is effectively meaningless; all it means is that there&#039;s a BOMe group stuck onto the N. The thing is, there are a lot of phenethylamines with room to stick a BOMe group onto the N. While I don&#039;t know how stable or active they would be, it&#039;s entirely reasonable to create such concoctions as MDA-NBOMe, DOX-NBOMe, 6-APB-NBOMe, or, yes, mescaline-NBOMe. All that is required is that the nitrogen atom isn&#039;t filled up with other stuff.<br /><br />TL;DR: NBOMe is not a class of chemicals; it is a functional group, like the methyl group you add to amphetamine to get meth or the methylenedioxy group you add to meth to get molly.

				Just smoke some weed, or whatever it is you like to do, and relax. Sometimes priority shipping can take 3 days, or even 4.

				Good stuff to know! So would you say that because a dose only requires a fraction of the chemical, does that make the chemical safer to consume?

Best thing to do is to order tabs from Tyl3r since they are accurate dosed and without hot-spots so you can use your scissor to cut them small.

The important measurement is the distance between an active dose and a dangerous dose. LD50, or &quot;lethal dose for 50% of individuals&quot;, is the canonical measurement of a dangerous dose. LSD has a tiny active dose, but a very high LD50 (when compared to the active dose anyway). Cannabis has a much larger active dose, but its LD50 is astronomical; as you likely know, it&#039;s impossible to overdose on weed (when dealing with bud, that is). The 2C-X-NBOMe series is very potent, but it also has a steep dose-response curve for its negative physical effects, and taking more than a few milligrams will invariably lead to hospitalization. Furthermore, it seems to have widely varying responses from different individuals, so what may be a safe dose for one person may not be a safe dose for another. These drugs are probably the best choice out of any &quot;pure&quot; psychedelics for use as party drugs, and they&#039;re really quite fun, but please be aware of their dangers and handle them with respect and care. As the Good Doctor said, &quot;You can turn your back on a person, but you can never turn your back on a drug.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139427.msg945838#msg945838">Quote from: Arakniid on March 27, 2013, 04:14 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Could someone explain to me what NBOME does to you? I see it alot on here but Ive never looked up its effects or anything like that<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The 2C-X-NBOMes are very visual, euphoric psychedelics with a very clear headspace (much clearer than shrooms or even acid) and a stimulant effect which is common among phenethylamines. It is a drug that you can take and feel totally normal inside your head while outside you&#039;re seeing lights and colors and feeling an orgasmic body high. Of course, it&#039;s not without its side-effects; it induces pretty severe vasoconstriction, which itself causes chills, muscle soreness, and, for the fellas, erectile disfunction and/or &quot;shrinkage&quot;. It&#039;s also stimmy, and it has some stimulant side-effects to go along with that, such as motor tics, shaking, and jaw-clenching. Like I said in my response above, it&#039;s a fun drug, but it&#039;s not one to be underestimated. Luckily, you can alleviate some of the bodyload with some planning ahead: Jaw-clenching can be alleviated by a number of means, and those of you who like to party with a girl named Molly probably know them all; vasoconstriction can be countered with weed, a LITTLE bit of alcohol, poppers, or pharmaceutical vasodilators, but be aware that psychoactive solutions will likely have a significant impact on the experience (weed tends to increase the intensity, while alcohol tends to decrease it).

				Oh, and I honestly have no clue about the effects of NBOMes outside of the 2C-X-NBOMe series. Sorry, but even though I know what its molecules look like, I have no clue how mescaline-NBOMe will affect you.
