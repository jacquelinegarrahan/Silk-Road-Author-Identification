				So, got my first order from SR yesterday afternoon.....a decent amount of gear from a well-known vendor with very close to 100% positive feedback...and actually got a pretty horrible bag.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to chalk it up to being unlucky and just getting a much larger proportion of cut to gear than is normal from him.....I&#039;m not going to identify the vendor as the purpose of this thread isn&#039;t to bitch and moan, but to see if I can salvage something from what I got.&nbsp; With feedback like his, I&#039;m willing to believe this was a fluke.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;d like to salvage what I can from my order, and after wading through some of well-known clearnet drug forums for a bit, I&#039;ve read a lot of advice I know to either be incorrect, outdated, or otherwise useless.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly sure the cut is ISO, as a dry acetone wash/evap didn&#039;t do much of anything to it.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem like MSM to me, but MSM hasn&#039;t been around in my neck of the woods for years and I may have forgotten what it was like.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a list of what&#039;s going on with this stuff:<br /><br />No onset when smoked, sometimes tastes very bad initially.&nbsp; Melts down extremely watery and runs from flame.&nbsp; After the first few, I started to burn off while blowing gently and waiting until I saw the puddle thicken up before letting it crackback, which generally happened about halfway through (by volume).&nbsp; Even then, the crackback takes forever (up to 30 seconds on a few) and a little over half the time I get pinwheels and &quot;leopard spots&quot; mixed in with what looks like what would be a pretty decent looking crackback.&nbsp; I do feel some effects, and it tends to taste pretty \ good after I &quot;reduce&quot; it by half or so but then I&#039;ll get blasts of that sour, ephedrine-ish taste out of nowhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;The lack of onset is what&#039;s really killing me....really frustrating as it&#039;s a kind of subtle life with no blast off.<br /><br />Anyway, anything it could be other than ISO?&nbsp; If not, does anybody know of anything I could try other than trying to get my hands on some cloroform? I haven&#039;t been able to find any other ways to remove ISO in my Googling,&nbsp; but maybe an OG will come by with some words of wisdom.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any and all input

				Sorry to hear you had a bad first transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I started buying here back in Feb/March, the stuff was pretty decent.&nbsp; I noticed that after my first few orders, I was getting either very heavily cut dope, and on several occasions now, All N-ISO.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is very frustrating to go through everything to buy dope;&nbsp; Bitcoins, checking vendors, worries about security only to get sold a bag of cut.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope that you contacted the vendor with your concerns.&nbsp; The ones who are doing this will just keep selling this garbage as long as they can get away with it.&nbsp; Being new, I understand wanting to build a good reputation as a buyer, but it is important to let the vendor and if you are willing, the other buyers via the forums, that you know you were sold fake dope.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, as you have seen through your research, there is nothing that can be done to turn N-ISO into meth, or even salvage any meth re-rocked with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Be careful when reading &#039;reviews&#039; in the forums as well.&nbsp; Vendors selling this crap have multiple forum &#039;members&#039; who post to say how great the latest gear from so-and-so is.&nbsp; Check any forum poster&#039;s history before buying on their recommendation.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you read the review forums for awhile, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; For example, a Jr. member who spammed to 50 in 10 minutes starts raving about what a great vendor this or that one is and how great their gear is.&nbsp; You may also notice the identical writing styles.&nbsp; <br /><br />If a vendor can sling $100+ grams of N-ISO that cost him pennies and get away with it, what happened to you will happen to many more people.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the reply Charles.<br /><br />It turned out to just be a shit-ton of unreacted ephederine....going to try an A/B today and see what I can get back.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice, but I let the vendor know my concerns and he is taking care of it...new memeber or not, I would at least let the vendor know in case he somehow wans&#039;t aware of a bad batch or what have you.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy with his solution to set things right, and had a feeling I wouldn&#039;t have any problems over it considering his rep and feedback. <br /><br />Anyway, anyone know of an easier way to remove leftover ephe? -_-
