				This vendor &quot;silverapples&quot; insists I release escrow because of buyers scamming her. But to be honest I already have another order to cancel from a certain PlanetExpress derivative. So yes, I know not to FE, but apparently I am not to be trusted as a client yet. <br /><br />I cannot find any reviews from this vendor, even though it says she has over 40 transactions But then again, KO has several 5/5 reviews for products, yet his vendor discussion page hints that he may have falsified these reviews. <br /><br />Long story short, I would rather not get bufotein than lose a tenth of a bitcoin. I can find several other psychedelics that would be of interest to me.

				Don&#039;t FE. It&#039;s bad for everybody. Find a vendor who will trust you or go buy some cheap ebooks and stuff to get your stats up. I never had to FE.

				I&#039;m just thinking since the profile says she wants FE after shipment, but she now says FE after accepting the transaction, it&#039;s best to find another vendor. It was a pain in the ass getting these coins on the SR anyway, and I already have enough risk in my life. <br /><br />Do these people think I&#039;m going to risk never being able to buy from them again by filing a false claim? Over 12 dollars? I would love to try her LSD someday.

				I agree with healingart but FE can also get you screwed too so be careful if you do.

				There are so many vendors that won&#039;t ask you to FE so why go to someone who insists on it? I won&#039;t say never FE (I do it for a couple of vendors I have long relationships with and they always come through) but I would say only do it when you have an established relationship with the vendor and they have a long history on delivering for those who FE. Otherwise I would say don&#039;t FE and there is nothing wrong with NEVER doing an FE, can&#039;t go wrong with that policy.

				If you refuse to FE then you reward the vendors who do not require it and take business away from those who do. With time it will change the landscape of the SR.<br /><br />If buyers refuse to FE then soon no vendors will require it.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Having looked at &quot;silverapples&quot; page they (she) are a very small operation that is not charging much for the service the provide. They also have a very positive service record. If you don&#039;t want to risk your $10 that is fine. But I would feel safer to FE $10 with a vender that has happy customers that to not FE with a vender that has a lot of unhappy venders. Beside you can always come back after you spend some time $ and prove you are not a risk. It is up to you.

				Escrow has your funds so the trust bit on the vendor side should decide them on whether to accept your order or not in the first place. If they want to have a fail-safe on whether they&#039;re going to be ripped off, they can always send out tracked mail. That gives them evidence if it goes to resolution and they&#039;ll get their cash.<br /><br />I guess some vendors working on a tight balance may argue they need the funds to get new stock. But if they&#039;re making that your problem you may as well be a shareholder ;D (I&#039;ve read some vendors offering a discount on FE, maybe for that reason?). <br /><br />If you&#039;re FE&#039;ing because you trust the vendor then why not - you&#039;re making an active decision that&#039;s based on (presumably) solid information and an informed choice. But if you&#039;re good enough for them to pick up your order, then ou have to ask yourself why they&#039;ve apparently become worried straight after you&#039;ve made the commitment on your side.<br /><br />I guess new vendors have to start somehow, but if they can stump up the cash for the bond and make a bulk purchase in the first place, it seems pretty unbelievable that they urgently need your little portion of retail cash. <br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s my 2 cents.

				I went ahead and did it for my first purchase after doing a little vendor research, i mean why not this is a risky business and id like to do more purchases in the future. Also, id like to do so without having to deal with making stupid purchases first to build a rep, weed and pipes i can get, and im certainly not here for anything legal. If FE builds a little trust my way no worries, the vendor has way more to lose then i do.

				Are your buyer stats good? If you have a decent amount of transactions to no refunds vendors shouldn&#039;t ask you to finalise early.

				I now have one transaction, no auto finalize, no refund, and spent a little over .1 btc<br /><br />I feel bad now because I ended up FE&#039;ing another order with safesecureair, but then again that vendor has feedback from other buyers. Also more than 300 transactions. I will admit I am still very nervous about that, and a few other FE&#039;s appeared this evening on his profile. I guess once I have some transactions I will try to order from her again, but I&#039;m reading the PlanetExpress thread and it makes me very weary of every vendor I come across right now.<br /><br />&nbsp;I placed an order with KetamineOcean as well and it turns out I may have jumped the gun, but if he asks for FE I won&#039;t be accepting that. I received a response that he will ship on Saturday with extra. The other orders I have not gotten a response yet, not sure what will happen overall to be honest, and trying to understand how the escrow system works in practice when coins get tied up. <br /><br />Either way it is fully within my right to spend my money how I please. I just hope the large order isn&#039;t requested a FE by the MXE vendor. So happens when I choose the cheapest item by weight trying to get the most bang for my buck.

				I just posted my experience with KetamineOcean here :<br />https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=208511.msg1507368#msg1507368<br /><br />Sounds very similar to what he did to you. This guy is no doubt a scammer.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m trying to figure out how to get this resolved ASAP so I can place a new order with those funds now in escrow... ugh...<br />Thanks for tying up my money you fucking dueschbag!!!<br /><br />Everyone else---- Do not order from KetamineOcean EVER!!
