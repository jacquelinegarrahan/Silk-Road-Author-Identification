				Posting here because I&#039;m not out of noobiesville on the forums yet. When I am I&#039;ll copy/paste this into the correct section.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered from TommyChong twice by now and I wanted to tell the story. This guy knows how to salt the bread. If you order from TommyChong make sure you have a sharp knife and if you don&#039;t you have two days to go and get one. Both our orders were buried in about an inch of plastic wrap and vacuum sealed bags. Totally solid in the box. No shaking, no smell, printed labels, very pro. Amazing product (my pool orders trim and shake for budget smoke).<br /><br />The second time was the same. QP for $250 Two days, buried. If you&#039;re looking for some cheap smoke TommyC&#039;s trimmers some of the laziest on the road. We sifted it out and here&#039;s what we came up with: the least of it was sticks, looks like its mostly already been sifted out, we probably got less than 5g of twigs in our qp. On the other end of the spectrum we picked out about 20g of buds larger than 1/4&quot;. Almost an ounce of actual fuckin nuggy buds in this damn trim qp. The rest was still saturated with little nuglets and bud fragments.<br /><br />Smoke the nugs: We got a mix bag of different nugs in the trim so each smoke sesh was a new experience but what a fresh, hardy high. Very clean. The surface of my skin was lit, lots of laughter, a very occupational high. I felt busy, I got work done, I slept soundly.<br /><br />Bake the sift: We made the rest into brownies, they were out of control. I can&#039;t even. We rode a roller coaster.<br /><br />Smoke the OTHER nug: You&#039;re like- &quot;What other nug?&quot; This dude threw in just under an eighth of Purple Urkel wound up in a separate softball of plastic wrap for us. Just free. We didn&#039;t even open it till we were out of the rest, that was yesterday, I&#039;m still high. Phenomenal nug TommyC, cut through a tolerance of two weeks of smoking already awesome buds and took me to space.<br /><br />Tommy&#039;s also one of the friendliest, most casual dudes on here. You can tell he&#039;s genuinely excited about his business and his customers and very invested in their experience with his products. Thanks TommyChong!
