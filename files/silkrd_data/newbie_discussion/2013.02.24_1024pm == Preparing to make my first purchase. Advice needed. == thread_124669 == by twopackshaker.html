				Hello all --<br /><br />I have already prepared myself by learning all that I know to prepare for to ensure the greatest security/privacy/anonymity possible. I&#039;ve learned PGP encryption/decryption for sensitive communications, in addition to learning about BitCoin, and have also researched different vendors and think I may finally have decided on one. <br /><br />Currently, he has over 200 fans and a 99% rating. I think he would be a pretty safe bet. Plus his prices, in my opinion, are extremely fair. <br /><br />I realize this is a long-ish post, and I sincerely apologize for that. I put the main points of each paragraph towards the beginning. Feel free to respond to any (or all) of the parts that you can, if you have any experience or knowledge you&#039;d like to share. <br /><br />So my question is this: I haven&#039;t actually purchased any BitCoin yet. I would prefer to go someplace locally where I can use CASH to purchase BitCoins, and the thing is, this particular seller actually claims to sell it himself in a way that sounds like it would allow me to do that. Has anybody ever heard of a &quot;reloadit card&quot; before? I have several places nearby that I could use the service... but is it secure? Or is it unwise, even? Again, the seller appears to have a good track record, so I would think it&#039;d be okay, but I don&#039;t want to get burned my first time.<br /><br />Second, I am going to want to order some points as well. If you don&#039;t know what those are, please don&#039;t respond to this part of the post. It&#039;s hard or impossible to get them legally where I live, and I personally want to get some if I can as well. My question is this, is it really possible to send something like that through the mail safely? I mean, the candy itself, MAYBE, but those seem like they&#039;d be harder to conceal. Any advice on that would be appreciated.<br /><br />Lastly, I know these sellers know what they are doing, but I still worry about having things come through the mail, even if it&#039;s domestically (I don&#039;t think I will ever do business internationally). How secure and stealthy, is it really? And beyond that... where should I get it sent, and how should I proceed to make sure it&#039;s just as safe and anonymous as possible, even in the last stage where you get your physical product(s). <br /><br />Sorry for such a long post, but I am very nervous about my first time doing things, even though I feel like I have done a lot of preparation to make sure both myself and the vendor are as safe as possible.<br /><br />God bless you all, <br /><br />--twopack

				For coins it depends on your location for recommendations. do a search of the forum for past discussions on your location. Failing that, localbitcoins should be able to do what you require with depositing cash directly.<br /><br />About security? There is little to no risk. It&#039;s just mail... Just send it to your home address with your correct name. The whole point is to just blend it in with regular mail. Of which millions are processed daily, these being no different.

I live in a fairly urban area so chances are there&#039;s lots of choices all around.

I am just curious. Especially before I put my real name and address on something, ya dig?<br /><br />Thank you for your input, though. Slowly getting to 50, meanwhile, lol :P

				Hi and welcome to SR (says another newbie&nbsp; :) ) <br /><br />I personally didn&#039;t try to buy Bitcoins in a 100% anonymous manner. Is it worth the effort ? I mean security is mostly about getting something as secured as it needs to be. The risk is often to fall into a paranoid state and spend more time preparing yourself than actually enjoying your product.<br /><br />I bought my BTC in a trading website similar to Mt-gox and was quite happy with it. Sure you could try to buy them with some cash and go with an hat and sunglasses to a local shop. In my opinion that would just make you more suspicious.<br /><br />There is two features from SR to protect the origin of my bitcoins:<br /><br />1) At any time you can generate a new address to receive bitcoins on SR. I may be wrong but that makes it already quite complicated for an external observer to know for sure your bitcoins went to SR.<br />2) The tumbler system splits your BTC when paying and then regroup them later after some &quot;decoy&quot; transactions.<br /><br />&nbsp;The above doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s impossible for an external observer to prove you sent BTC to SR, yet it would be insanely difficult if it&#039;s possible.<br />As long as you don&#039;t do big orders or order &quot;extremely controlled illegal stuff&quot; in your country, the above effort would seem exaggerated.<br /><br />I did only one order so I&#039;m no expert but I think it&#039;s statistically a ton safer than buying anything on the street.<br /><br />As SNSD mentionned, remember that&#039;s just mail. As long as you don&#039;t admit ordering this, it will be very difficult for someone to prove anything. My biggest fear is a &quot;controlled&quot; delivery followed by a search warrant. But I don&#039;t think you can obtain a search warrant for tiny amounts...<br /><br />I would recommend that you focus more on the way you will receive your order rather than getting crazzy on how to obtain bitcoins.<br /><br />As i&#039;ve no idea what &quot;points&quot; are or what you want to order I can&#039;t really help for the delivery itself. (BTW what is that ? Just out of curiosity :) )<br /><br />If you really want to do it 100% safe, you should not :<br /><br />1) Send it to your own home.<br />2) Send it to your own name.<br />3) Pick it up right after delivery ? (If you go straight away to your box, i personally thinks it&#039;s suspicious of someone expecting a package soon).<br />4) Do not use your product where it was delivered.<br /><br />You could use someone else mailbox but you really got to be cautious. If you tell that person, you need to trust her. If you don&#039;t tell this person you better be sure the mailman will not feel something&#039;s off (a delivery to someone who left for holidays ?).<br /><br />Some mailbox are really easy to open (Bump keys or lockpicking tools) and that can be a good way to use someone else mailbox but you got to be careful. <br /><br />Be rational ! Do a list of what&#039;s the most dangerous thing for your order and then work in each points. It&#039;s not worth securing the wrong thing except if you really want to achieve top notch security.<br /><br />Oh and about the vendor, I would suggest to contact them in case of doubts ! Before my first order, I asked for some advices and stats from the vendor. It surely helped me to know that this vendor had a 100% success on domestic orders. I mean vendors do know how successful they are for each countries, I would suggest you ask nicely to your vendor of choice. Plus, it may get the vendor more keen to trust you since they already talked to you and saw that you are worried ! (A scamer wouldn&#039;t bother most of the time...).<br /><br />EDIT after your latest reply:<br /><br />1) Remember not to get paranoid ! Blending in is the best way to stay safe.<br />2) Security always must be proportionate to risk<br /><br />We can&#039;t really tell you how packages are made stealth but the important thing is :<br /><br />1) The outside : Printed labels tend to make the package looks more professionnal and blend in among small business letters/packages.<br />2) The inside and the smell: The inside look is pretty useless since an opened package will most likely be lost and detected. The smell can be nearly entirely suppressed by vacuum sealing everything. Yet i still think a very welll trained dog would certainly pick it up if you put it right under is nose. But a dog has it&#039;s cost and doesn&#039;t seems to really go on conveyers anyway.<br /><br />If a vendor has hundreds of successful shipping, then you can guess it&#039;s stealth techniques are effective enough.<br /><br />Oh and one last thing, domestic orders are way less controlled than international ones. Just get figures on the FULL total of letters sent on one day and you will know it&#039;s impossible to control everything. At this point their priority is to detects what comes from abroad rather than locally. <br /><br />Hope it helps and good luck for your first order ! (Again, DO NOT GET PARANOID, nor uncautious)<br />

				For all those wondering, points are hypodermic needles, basically. At least that&#039;s what I meant when I said it. So much for being discreet I guess. But yes, they are quite noticeable, no? Would you have them sent to you in the mail? Cause I am seriously about to try. Once I get my PO box or whatever set up, cause I don&#039;t want them sent where I reside the most. Or anywhere else for that matter that other people could be affected by it. <br /><br />And dude, I wouldn&#039;t be going into any stores in sunglasses and/or what&#039;s basically stereotypically the suspicious person&#039;s uniform to a store where there is in fact no sunlight. I can buy BitCoins, to use later however I choose, legally. They have no clue. Part of the beauty of the coin is it IN ITSELF is also pretty anonymous. It&#039;s just funny cause where I live if you go indoors with sunglasses on, or something like that, you&#039;ll probably get shot. <br /><br />I am going to have to read the rest of your post a little bit later because I am sort of drunk. But thank you for the information, and I will respond in depth once I realize exactly what you said :P

				I assume you&#039;re in the US? I am too. I used bitinstant.com from the regular internet. I found out that the local walmart would take moneygrams(they&#039;re blue slips at the customer service counter)I placed my order with bitinstant, to my desired wallet. I took the verification email with me on my smartphone. I took out the money from the atm, shot shit with the kid at the desk who was in a metal band and pretty excited to talk about it, and also bitcoins. He had seen that I was using bitinstant and mentioned he has seen the name of the company often. <br /><br />Now I am from a small town in the US. And enough people are buying bitcoins for whatever reason that a 23 year old kid with ear plugs and a fohawk recognized the name. I handed him the cash said good luck, as he did me. I went home, checked my wallet and zap. there they were. I moved them to my offline wallet, then to my blockchain online account then upped to SR. The entire process took maybe 12 hours. It would have been maybe 2 hours had I synced my offline wallet blocks. Which I had to allow to do over night while I slept. <br /><br />It was that easy and to be honest with you, fun. For me anyway. Feel free to message me pm if you have questions in regards to this comment. I hope it helps, if not. I hope you find what you seek. =)

				Oh well :)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know what points were. That means my &quot;advices&quot; on stealth packages are quite irrelevant. Specific items may need specific shipments techniques. For the rest, I still think it may be useful :)<br /><br />Glad to learn about BitInstant, i got to see if that&#039;s achievable in my country !<br /><br />I wonder why so many people thinks buying Bitcoins is so suspicious. I mean it&#039;s used in many other things than SR right ? I personnally don&#039;t want to take too much time securing the payment part while the most dangerous part is clearly receiving the package.<br /><br />Good luck !<br /><br />Anonom.

				You&#039;re not a dummy, I am still nub to this. I know I filled out the bitinstant, had my validation slip sent to my yahoo email, that way I could get my mail on my smartphone so I could get the numbers off it. You can print it, right them down. whatever. You are not required to show Id. I think the store money grams will only do 500-1k depending on the store...USD. Larger ones just do at a bank, if anyone asks. Fuck them you&#039;re investing your money. It is no different then buying gold or silver. And you do not have to tell the shit. <br /><br />

				No, there will be a drop down menu when you go to bitinstant and you choose your the location closet to you. You can take it to the place further, it shows all of them. It lists the closest. super stealth I guess if you go further. Fuck all that though. <br /><br />Dirk McGirk!

For whatever reason, BitInstant makes you choose one before it will show you the form, but once you have the form, you can take it anywhere.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124669.msg858548#msg858548">Quote from: twopackshaker on February 25, 2013, 03:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Don&#039;t really want to say exactly where I am.

They keep saying when it will be back only to miss deadline after deadline. I&#039;ve heard that some people are still business as usual for deposits to Mt. Gox and other reserves. Personally I would completely stay away from them for now. If they&#039;re not scamming (which I doubt they are), they&#039;re having some serious cash flow issues or something. <br /><br />If you have a Bank of America near you, there are many options to deposit cash directly there. There aren&#039;t any near me, and I&#039;m struggling to find a convenient alternative to BitInstant. They had been so good up until now that I never had a backup plan and it&#039;s biting me in the butt.
