				As well as drugs, I&#039;ve come to the deep web for weapons.<br />I&#039;ve already got a shopping cart full of drugs, tobacco, and other illegal goods here at SR.<br />Now I want to spend some money on guns, knives, and other goods of the sort.<br />Who can point me in a direction to start looking?<br /><br />(I&#039;ll also respond to every post, so that I can get to 50 posts faster.)<br />

				it wasn&#039;t making money and giving SR bad publicity with the blatantly obvious link between the 2 sites. try the hidden wiki if you haven&#039;t already. you can buy knives in shops though, you know those commercial buildings along the street. amazon do some good value chefs knives.

				it is easy enough to find the most trusted vendors from the armory around the forums,<br />so i would suggest that you find one of them, get in contact and workout a deal with them.<br />just cause they shutdown the armory, does not mean the vendors disappeared or ran out of products.<br /><br />DFT

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages.

It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites???
