				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I received my first order today. I&#039;m not a regular user of cocaine and drugs in general, but I like it occasionally.<br />For my first order, the packaged was perfect, impossible to detect its content. I read a lot of information on the forum about security (I use crypted adress for example), but I need to reassure me .. Some questions:<br /><br />- How often do you order?<br /><br />- What are the risks for a buyer to be harassed by the police if the packaged is intercepted ?<br /><br />- Can you confirm that the main risk on a transaction is that the package is intercepted?<br /><br />- How many orders have you done without a package intercepted?<br /><br />- Is that some have had intercepted a package without problems with the police?<br /><br />Thank you for your answers. I know that I&#039;m a little paranoid, but since I&#039;m not a regular user but a men who like partying, I will be annoyed to have problems for small purchases occasionnaly. <br /><br />Enjoy !

If the vendor has impeccable packaging and it&#039;s personal amounts, I wouldn&#039;t worry much. <br /><br />- What are the risks for a buyer to be harassed by the police if the packaged is intercepted ?<br />Again, if it&#039;s personal amounts it will be seized and they will send you what&#039;s called a love letter. I&#039;m not too certain,but i believe it states that you have X days to come pick up the package with proof you have the right papers to import it legally, if not they will be destroyed and that&#039;s the end of it.<br /><br />- Can you confirm that the main risk on a transaction is that the package is intercepted?<br />I would say the main risk is a Controlled Delivery (CD) where an officer will dress up as a mailman and hand you the package, once you accept the package they will arrest you right there. Again, they don&#039;t usually do this for personal amounts. They don&#039;t have time for the average user. They are trying to catch the big time supplier.<br /><br />- How many orders have you done without a package intercepted?<br />I&#039;ve spent over 1k without a single package intercepted. As long as the vendor has decent packaging and it&#039;s in personal amounts, you should be fine.<br /><br />- Is that some have had intercepted a package without problems with the police?<br />Not sure what you mean by this. A lot of people have gotten the love letters.

				- How often do you order?<br />Collectively, our team has ordered several times with no issues.&nbsp; We order from vendors whom demonstrate the ability to understand stealth shipping, PGP, and overall security.<br /><br />- What are the risks for a buyer to be harassed by the police if the packaged is intercepted ?<br />The risks are huge.&nbsp; Your name and/or address is on the package!&nbsp; &nbsp; The big question I would ask is, what liability are you at if you were receiving the package.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be easy for me to plead ignorance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember a story about a woman who received a fedex package with a bunch of weed in it, and a guy came to collect it later. She called the police.&nbsp; &nbsp;The way that worked is, most people wouldn&#039;t open the package, and the dealer would walk up to the house late and say &quot;Hey, fedex made a mistake, it&#039;s my package&quot;.&nbsp; The point being, how would the investigators prove you actually purchased drugs?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />- Can you confirm that the main risk on a transaction is that the package is intercepted?<br />No.&nbsp; Even buying drugs in the USA is a crime, regardless of whether or not they are delivered.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not careful and you make mistakes in the buying process, you can give out information that will screw you.<br /><br />- How many orders have you done without a package intercepted?<br />I&#039;ve never had a package intercepted, as a vendor or as a customer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />- Is that some have had intercepted a package without problems with the police?<br />Certainly, this happens.&nbsp; Understand also that mail isn&#039;t 100% perfect.&nbsp; Sometimes packages go to the wrong address, they get lost, destroyed, and sometimes people break into the packages to steal contents.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
