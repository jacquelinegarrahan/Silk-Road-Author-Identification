				The top 20 things not to say to a cop when he pulls you over.<br /><br />20. I can&#039;t reach my license unless you hold my beer.<br /><br />19. Sorry officer, I didn&#039;t realize my radar detector wasn&#039;t plugged in.<br /><br />18. Aren&#039;t you the guy from the villiage people?<br /><br />17. Hey, you must have been doing 125 to keep up with me, good job.<br /><br />16. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical shape to be a police officer.<br /><br />15. I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.<br /><br />14. Bad cop. No donut.<br /><br />13. You&#039;re not going to check the trunk, are you?<br /><br />12. Gee, that gut sure doesn&#039;t inspire confidence.<br /><br />11. Didn&#039;t I see you get your butt kicked on cops?<br /><br />10. Is it true that people become cops because they are too dumb to work at McDonalds?<br /><br />9. I pay your salary<br /><br />8. So uh, you on the take or what?<br /><br />7. Gee officer, that&#039;s terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning.<br /><br />6. Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.<br /><br />5. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there is no other cars around, that&#039;s how far they are ahead of me.<br /><br />4. What do you mean have I been drinking? You are the trained specialist.<br /><br />3. Well, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell off of my lap and got lodged between the brake and the gas pedal, forcing me to speed out of control.<br /><br />2. Hey, is that a 9mm? That&#039;s nothing compared to this 44 magnum.<br /><br />1. Hey, can you give me another one of those full cavity searches?

				Late one Friday night the policeman spotted a man driving very erratically through the streets of Dublin. They pulled the man over and asked him if he had been drinking that evening.<br /><br />&quot;Aye, so I have. &#039;Tis Friday, you know, so me and the lads stopped by the pub where I had six or seven pints. And then there was something called &quot;Happy Hour&quot; and they served these mar-gar-itos which are quite good. I had four or five o&#039; those. Then I had to drive me friend Mike home and O&#039; course I had to go in for a couple of Guinness - couldn&#039;t be rude, ye know. Then I stopped on the way home to get another bottle for later ..&quot; And the man fumbled around in his coat until he located his bottle of whiskey, which he held up for inspection.<br /><br />The officer sighed, and said, &quot;Sir, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll need you to step out of the car and take a breathalyzer test.&quot;<br /><br />Indignantly, the man said, &quot;Why? Don&#039;t ye believe me?!&quot;

				A man with a nagging secret couldn&#039;t keep it any longer. In the confessional he admitted that for years he had been stealing building supplies from the lumberyard where he worked.<br /><br />&quot;What did you take?&quot; his priest asked.<br /><br />&quot;Enough to build my own house and enough for my son&#039;s house. And houses for our two daughters and our cottage at the lake.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is very serious,&quot; the priest said. &quot;I shall have to think of a far-reaching penance. Have you ever done a retreat?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, Father, I haven&#039;t,&quot; the man replied. &quot;But if you can get the plans, I can get the lumber.&quot;

				John was driving when a policeman pulled him over. He rolled down his window and said to the officer, &quot;Is there a problem, Officer?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No problem at all. I just observed your safe driving and am pleased to award you a $5,000 Safe Driver Award. Congratulations. What do you think you&#039;re going to do with the money?&quot;<br /><br />John thought for a minute and said, &quot;Well, I guess I&#039;ll go get that drivers&#039; license.&quot;<br /><br />Judi, sitting in the passenger seat said to the policeman, &quot;Oh, don&#039;t pay attention to him -- he&#039;s just a wise guy when he&#039;s drunk and stoned.&quot;<br /><br />Brian from the back seat said, &quot;I told you guys we wouldn&#039;t get far in a stolen car!&quot;<br /><br />At that moment, there was a knock from the trunk and a muffled voice said, &quot;Are we over the border yet?&quot;

				An old guy walks into a bar and asks for a bottle of forty-year old Scotch.&nbsp; The bartender, not wanting to give up the good liquor, pours a shot of ten-year Scotch and figures that the guy won&#039;t be able to tell the difference.&nbsp; The guy downs the Scotch and says: &quot;This Scotch is only ten years old!&nbsp; I specifically asked for forty-year old Scotch.&quot;<br /><br />Amazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar and pulls out a bottle of twenty-year old Scotch and pours the man a shot.&nbsp; The guy drinks it down and says, &quot;That was twenty-year old Scotch.&nbsp; I asked for forty-year old Scotch.&quot;<br /><br />So the bartender goes into the back room and brings out a bottle of thirty-year old Scotch and pours the guy a drink.&nbsp; &nbsp;By now a small crowd has gathered around the man and is watching anxiously as he downs the latest drink.&nbsp; Once again the guy states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original request for forty-year old Scotch.<br /><br />The bartender can hold off no longer and disappears into the cellar to get a bottle of prime forty-year old Scotch. Soon, the bartender returns with the bottle and pours a shot. The guy downs the Scotch and says, &quot;Now this is forty-year old Scotch!&quot;&nbsp; The crowd applauds his discriminating palate.<br /><br />An old drunk who had been watching the proceedings with interest, raises a full shot glass of his own and says, &quot;Here, take a swig of this.&quot;<br /><br />The guy takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow. Immediately, he chokes and spits out the liquid on the barroom floor. &quot;My God!&nbsp; That tastes like piss,&quot; he yells.<br /><br />&quot;Great guess,&quot; says the drunk.&nbsp; &quot;Now, how old am I?&quot;

				A boy is born without a body, only a head. For his 18th birthday his father, takes him to a bar for a drink.<br /><br />The father orders his son a scotch and when the boy drinks it, an arm pops out of his head. He drinks another shot and another arm pops out. After the next shot a torso pops out. After more shots, suddenly, he has a whole body.<br /><br />The boy runs out of the bar and gets hit by a truck, killing him instantly. A drunkard in the corner looks at the father and says, &quot;He should have quit while he was a head.&quot;

				One night a man decides to visit his local bar. He takes a seat and orders a beer. After polishing off his beer, he beckons the bartender over and says, &quot;Betcha $20 I can bite my eye.&quot;<br /><br />The bartender scoffs and accepts. The man then calmly removes his false eye and bites it. The bartender grudgingly forks over a twenty.<br /><br />Later that night, after a few more beers, the man wanders back to the bar and says rather drunkenly, &quot;Hey barkeep, betcha another $20 I can bite my other eye.&quot;<br /><br />Wanting to win back his money and seriously doubtful that the man has two false eyes, the bartender accepts. The man calmly removes his false teeth and bites his other eye. Scowling, the bartender hands over another twenty. The man leaves and wanders around the bar as he drinks a few more beers.<br /><br />He strolls back over to the bar, leaning on it, again and calls the bartender, &quot;Hey, barkeep,&quot; he burbles, &quot;I&#039;ll give you a chance to win yer money back plus. Betcha $100 if you put a shot glass on that end of the bar, and I stood on this end, I could piss into it and not spill a drop.&quot;<br /><br />The bartender eagerly accepts, knowing the feat to be impossible. The man wobbily climbs atop the bar, zips down his fly and promptly pisses all over the bar. He zips up, sits down, slaps the $100 on the bar and laughs uproarously.<br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s so funny?&quot; says the barkeep. &quot;You just lost everything you won and more!&quot;<br /><br />Well,&quot; giggles the man, &quot;I just bet those guys over there $200 that I could piss all over your bar and you wouldn&#039;t get angry.&quot;
