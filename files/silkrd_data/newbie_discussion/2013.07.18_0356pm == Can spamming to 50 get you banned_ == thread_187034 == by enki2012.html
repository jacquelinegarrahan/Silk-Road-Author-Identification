				I don&#039;t really see much purpose in the 50 post rule seeing as people just spam it anyway. Trying to do it with legitimate content is tedious and longwinded.<br />And that captcha thing about decoding books, I thought that was only for the google ones that have two words, one being the captcha and then the more readable one being a word from a book?<br />I mean if you wanted to get tinfoil hats about it imagine if captchas were some weird coded way of making you reveal system info about your connection/PC or something by displaying it in code and you typing it into the script.

I think the rule, when implemented properly, can really help to form high quality topics and well thought out responses. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m a bit jaded, but I plan on slowly achieving my 50 posts, and using this time to benefit the community, and make quality posts. The &#039;Newbie Discussion&#039; board shouldn&#039;t be filled with &#039;spam to 50&#039; posts, that does nothing for the community, in my personal opinion.
