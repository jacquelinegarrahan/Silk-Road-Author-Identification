				So I&#039;ve set up an account on Silk Road, and at Mt.Gox, and I&#039;m having one fuck of a time trying to figure out how to make this all work.&nbsp; I live in Pittsburgh, where there seem to be no TrustCash locations to change cash into Bitcoins.....&nbsp; How the fuck can I turn cash into Bitcoins?&nbsp; I have no bank accounts (at least not that I will expose to these endeavors).&nbsp; What do I do?&nbsp; Thanks

				if there is a moneygram location that u know of go there, use the blue form with the info u recieve from bitinstant.com most commonly found at cvs,walmart,latin american stores. paying in person with cash has got to be safer than mt gox. just go to bitinstant.com, i always choose the send to bitcoin address option,type in your bitcoin address, a fake name an number, and the amount u would like deposited. be sure to include extra for the 3.99 percent fee bit instant takes and the fee for zip zap you will see after you complete the bitinstant page.

				The simplest and easiest way to do so would be to go to a store like CVS and buy a MoneyPak card. Then just give the code to one of the trusted MP to Bitcoin vendors on here. I personally use BTC Buddy when I go through this route, not sure if he&#039;s still around right now or not.

				Use bitinstant. They have a plethora of options. Also, you can fund MtGox directly from your bank account. Buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal. Just make sure you &quot;wash&quot; them before transferring to SR.

				Your bitcoin address is in front of your blockchain.info account if you use them,<br />you can also create new bitcoin addresses if you go to Receive Money, and hit the<br />green one on the right New Address.<br /><br />Its different in all your bitcoin wallets, but this was for your blockchain wallet.

Or is this not the simplest way of converting cash to bitcoin?

				Here is a link to a clearnet site with very simple and safe directions for the bitinstant.com process, they use send to e-mail (tormail) and everything is done while using Torbrowser and you makeup a name and address phone number and all. Totally anon (copy this to your regular browser):<br /><br />https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2012/04/how-to-buy-bitcoins-anonymously-in-the-us-instantly/<br /><br />The issue with BitInstant is it is a bit pricey when you start to convert large amounts of money, but I think they may have a $500 limit or something.<br /><br />Mushmold

				Fuck I&#039;m impressed.&nbsp; A dozen helpful responses with crossed T&#039;s and dotted I&#039;s in under a day.&nbsp; I must admit I expected a little less than perfect grammer when I asked for help about a site that sells drugs, but I must admit I was wrong.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ll use BitInstant.&nbsp; I created an order last night (but haven&#039;t gone to the store and actually paid yet) to transfer to MtGox.&nbsp; Am I losing additional money by doing this?&nbsp; Can I do nothing with the order (let it expire) and create a new one that sends to email?&nbsp; Is transfer to email the best way?<br /><br />Thanks

				I believe they give you 72 hrs that the quote is valid for.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t let it expire yet but I would assume it is in their best interest to just destroy the old quote when it expires and allow you to make another one.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t cost them more money to allow you a second chance at receiving 3.99% from you.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried going to directly to email but I can attest to having used Mt. Gox multiple times with no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; I like using Mt. Gox because it allows you buy/sell similarly to a FOREX account with traditional currencies.&nbsp; This allows you to enter and exit the BitCoin economy on your terms allowing you to buy/sell at certain times if you discover patterns of when the cost point is most beneficial to you.&nbsp;

				I would also like to know about &quot;washing&quot; bitcoins before transferring to SR.&nbsp; Reasoning why and how.&nbsp; I thought SR tumbled bitcoin before deposit in your account anyways.&nbsp; Is &quot;tumbling&quot; the &quot;washing&quot; process?
