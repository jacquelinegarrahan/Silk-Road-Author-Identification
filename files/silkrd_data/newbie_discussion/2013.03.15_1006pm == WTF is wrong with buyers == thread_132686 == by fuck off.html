				Obviously you were looking for better reviews, but they still left 5/5s. The top 2 may come back and update with a full review once they try the product (hopefully). But I agree it gives buyers a better sense of a product when other buyers actually describe what they got etc..<br /><br />May I ask what the product was? I&#039;m asking because maybe they didn&#039;t realize you tripled the amount. Many people can&#039;t tell 300mg from 100mg for instance and many people do not weigh out their orders right away.

				It&#039;s possible this is their first time dealing with drugs and can&#039;t readily eyeball whatever it is that you sold them and don&#039;t have access to a scale so they didn&#039;t weigh it.

				Why you so mad? They left a perfect score and mention that the product was great. It&#039;s what all vendors happen to mention on their page and&nbsp; some vendors I feel like it&#039;s forced upon to give a perfect score or get blacklisted. People don&#039;t really follow the feedback on the product list, At least I don&#039;t, I feel as though they&#039;re all good or bad reviews but without knowing who said it, it just empty words to me. I would be more concerned on what it&#039;s to be said on the review thread than on the feedback on vendors listing. In case you&#039;re thinking &quot;bitch you must be one of them who that leave short lazy feedbacks&quot; No sorry, since I&#039;m still on the road to 50 on the board I do leave a detailed feed back for the vendors I use.

				some people don&#039;t weigh their goods, or was it LSD or something?<br /><br /><br />I am sometimes wondering if vendors and buyers want longer feedback?<br /><br />I am able to write (without talking about how the product was packed) a lot more, but I write according to how other people are writing, and that&#039;s very short I think. If buyers and vendors want more detailed stuff it&#039;s not problem for me doing this. How do you people think about this subject.

				I think a good idea would be for SR to add more fields to the ratings, instead of a 1-5 rating and a comment. People who want to describe more would do so, the rest would keep up the short reviews.

				The whole ratings system if fucked up to begin with. There need to be major changes to it that are more reflective on both sides, vendors and buyers. You got 5&#039;s, better than 2 or 3&#039;s. Were they forced to FE early? There could be plenty of reasons why they didnt write better feedback, but this just proves it more, that a better system is needed. <br /><br />What was sold? Weed, LSD,???, if it&#039;s wasnt something that could easily notice the increase in product, that may account for it. When<br />I order something, if I get an extra pill or whatever it may be, I usually comment on it on in feedback. If I get 2-4 extra for example, then it is certainly worth my while to add top notch feedback. It all depends on the product/price/vendor/communication/friendlyness....<br /><br />Nothing burns my arse more than shelling out top $$$ for something, putting up with delayed shipping, no DCN, then an attitude when I ask about my order, only to get 5 pills (if I ordered 5) for example. Esp if they are a &quot;top rated&quot; vendor, that I&#039;ve done much business with.<br /><br />If the vendors really care, the sellers will notice, and the feedback will talk for itself over time. 1 or 2 orders, isnt going to do it these days!<br />

				It&#039;s probably very easy for a vendor to create positive feedback by themselves. They just order their own product multiple times. It&#039;s like swapping BTC&#039;s over and over. They a very slight amount to SR.

				I always write at least 2 or 3 sentences in a review of product. I think kind words give vendors a sence of appreciation for what they`re doing. Happy vendors make happy customers in my opinion so people please take time to let a good vendor know that they`re doing a fine job.

				I often will not leave public comments about great hook-ups from a vendor, though something like a tripled order I would certainly thank the vendor privately. I don&#039;t think its particularly fair to denote gifts/etc in the feedback as then other buyers may come to expect freebies and then leave less than a 5 even though they got what they ordered, but didn&#039;t get anything extra.

If you are adding weight to try and be friends or get respect on the feedback you will be losing either way.<br /><br />This is business and nothing more. Whining about customers is a great way to make them go away. If you want your customers to respond a certain way then ask them to in a pm.

				There has been a massive increase in size of SR communitiy over past few months, and many newbies are &quot;forced&quot; to FE and give glowing feedback for chance of getting a shipment.&nbsp; I ordered LSD from Joanna Bravo who seemed honorable, only to have her disappear after I FE&#039;ed(stupid) and gave good feedback because of minor price break.&nbsp; I have gone back and changed feedback to reflect disappointing outcome.&nbsp; It seems more and more vendors are deciding to close up shop,&nbsp; and making one last scam before leaving.&nbsp; Sucks...
