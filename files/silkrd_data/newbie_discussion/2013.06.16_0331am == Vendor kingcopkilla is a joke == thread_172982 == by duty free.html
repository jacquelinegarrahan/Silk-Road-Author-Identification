				Bought one of this puke&#039;s half gram bags of meth. Most people that I&#039;ve noticed, when talking about his product seem very enthused. Unfortunately, I couldn&#039;t agree. I dunno if there are shills abound, or if people don&#039;t know decent methamphetamine from a lump of snot, or if I got something completely different from other people, but what I got from him was garbage. Sure it got me high, but it felt like it was all adrenergic, with very little if any dopaminergic activity. Made me jittery as all hell, tight chest, in general just uncomfortable and not what one would consider a recreational, or even useful high. I wasn&#039;t even able to enjoy music all that much on it, even just that alone speaks volumes to me when you talk about dopamine, or lack thereof. Could probably get to the same level much more cheaply by eating an entire box of Sudafed.<br /><br />The lousy effects, along with the tell-tale pinwheel shaped crackback patterning screamed unreacted pseudoephedrine to me. There was also some leopard spot patterning a little bit here and there (N-Isopropylbenzylamine or similar, I believe), but that&#039;s somewhat par for the course with a lot of meth these days. But for the most part, it was those dreaded pinwheels.<br /><br />Like a dumbass I finalized when I received, but before I tried the product. That was my stupidity, and I deal with that. Whatever, maybe I&#039;ll finally learn something here. But the fact that I was sold utter shit isn&#039;t even what bothered me that much. When I started in on the bag and found that I was hating how it was making me feel, I got in touch with KCK and bounced my experience off him. He said he had zero complaints, but told me to send my shipping address again and offered to send three points out of a different bag. Seemed reasonably fair all things considered, but when I first sampled his shit, I was on the tail end of a four day run. Especially with all the glowing reviews I kept reading, I pushed conventional logic and years of tweak experience aside. I thought maybe it&#039;s just my biochemistry, I&#039;m burnt out... figured maybe the right thing to do was get some rest and start fresh after a few days, and then re-evaluate KCK&#039;s product. That done, the theory was a total reach, as well as wishful thinking. It still sucked hairy ass.<br /><br />So I get back to KCK, and gently, respectfully and with kid gloves confirm with him that what he sold me contains very little, if any meth. I wait a few days, no reply. Somewhat in vain, I shoot him another short message and this time he does reply, saying he would reship from a different batch. Later in the day I get another message, he says something to the effect that he &quot;might not be able to get to the meth today&quot;, and would I like coke or crack instead. Of course, my preference is to get what I originally paid for, and I told him this. But I was concerned about quality all around, so I told him if he&#039;s sure that his coke isn&#039;t cut to all hell then that&#039;s fine by me, and to go ahead and send what he thought would be most worthwhile quality-wise, since by this time I&#039;m reading a few shit-ass reviews about both his meth as well as his coke, interspersed with the great reviews and feedback.<br /><br />Well, his inquiry about sending coke rather than meth seems to be some sort of lame, completely misguided test of his, and I&#039;m completely dumbfounded over his next reply, which goes like this: <br /><br />&quot;you must be part of the scammer crew with blackmarket charlie well run back to the meth forum and tell the THE COP KILLA BOWS DOWN TO NOBODY!!!!!&quot;<br /><br />Well done, genius. That&#039;s surely my intent, to swindle half grams of blow by buying your bunk ass meth while giving you the benefit of the doubt not once, but twice. I&#039;m a complete and total jackass for giving an anonymous drug dealer any benefit of any fucking doubt. I enabled this shit with my brainlessness, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that its an ultra hard kick in the dick to be called a scammer by the douche who in essence, scammed me. Talk about insulting... I&#039;ve never even posted in the meth thread before, for fuck&#039;s sake. Hope you enjoy my eighty bucks, Sherlock.<br /><br />Moral of this story? They (generally, with a few exceptions) don&#039;t give a fuck about you, so return the favor. Let them wait a few days to be paid if need be. Finalizing upon receipt, but before 100% confirmation of quality is just as risky as finalizing immediately after placing the order. But most of you know this already.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t realize I had written a damn book here. Did this need to be this lengthy? Probably not, but it feels good to vent. Besides, it&#039;s too easy to do that at length when working with decent product. No thanks to kingcopkilla. Dick.

				Hey Duty Free,<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to post and warn others about KCK.<br /><br />You are correct about the crap you received.&nbsp; Other members who wrote about their experiences were just like yours and mine.&nbsp; People have been getting sick from this asshole&#039;s shit AND he has the nerve to call the buyers &#039;scammers&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />He&#039;s likely gone now.&nbsp; As is a related account, FastForward.<br /><br />There is no real shit being sold here now, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Everything I have ordered in the last 3-4 months from five different vendors has all been N-ISO.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do your own research, and I hope other buyers will as well, but I think most of these domestic vendor accounts are all supplied from the same source, and they may even be run by the same person.<br /><br />BUYERS PLEASE REVIEW!&nbsp; <br /><br />DON&#039;T BUY FAKE DOPE!<br /><br />This is the only way this market will change.

Maybe it&#039;s because the market of meth make them act as idiots sometimes or because they also use their product and this has turned them into silly individuals (it can happen with certain products) by and by.

That statement was off base, and it stemmed from a mix of anger and incredulity. Being accused of scamming, by the guy who is doing the scamming can have a way of skewing one&#039;s outlook for a short while. There are certainly good, honest vendors who want their customers to be happy, no doubt.

				Charles- You mentioned FastForward as a related account? What did you mean by that? I have ordered a couple times from FF and the last time his shipping got real fucked up, but I don&#039;t think he was to blame and he made it right big time. I ordered 20 80op from him after about 15 days he finally said PO would be delivering them soon. He even overnighted me a couple for free and then 2 days later the original package showed. The USPS tag was ripped about 3/4 off and it looked like someone hand wrote the missing parts in that were barely readable. It looked like USPS fucked up the tag and it sat around for awhile before it was finally corrected and then delivered. Did you have a bad experience as I was planning on going to him again since he did come through in the end. whats his relation to KCK? That guys add sounds sketchy as shit and I would be very wary of ordering from him.
