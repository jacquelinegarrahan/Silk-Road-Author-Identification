				For those who are just trying to get their posts up so they can give reviews, why not start a review page here in the newbie forum &amp; just start posting instead of whining about it!<br />It looks like in going through this forum, most of the complaining about not being able to post anywhere else is about giving reviews.&nbsp; If your vendor had a review page in this forum, that would eliminate quite a bit of that frustration, no?<br /><br />NCK<br /><br />NO need to FE!

				I&#039;ll fucking do it.<br />My first purchase was 2 tabs from a guy by the name of Fatburger, who I confused with the star vendor known as Fartbomber, an easy mistake. Fatburger sells WoW listed at 100ug. He was quick to respond and decently quick with the shipping. I thought my tabs had degraded a bit by the time my friend and I dropped them (about a month after they arrived), but after talking to some other users, I&#039;m guessing they were just weaken than advertised. Not by a lot but enough to make several people wonder. It was clean shit though, and I had a good time. No complaints here.

				haven&#039;t tried your service yet.&nbsp; Heard your quality is awesome, but you&#039;re a bit out of my price range and don&#039;t offer enough bulk
