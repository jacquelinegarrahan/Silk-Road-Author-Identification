				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this forum but not SR.&nbsp; I have quite a few transactions under my belt and would like to leave a review for my latest one, though that is not possible due to my membership status.&nbsp; How do you expedite the process of becoming a full member so that I can make posts?

				Jesus, looks like I&#039;ve got some work to do.&nbsp; That&#039;s a shame since I just got pretty fucked over by a vendor and I want my anger to be expressed in full in the review, which will be subsided by the time I&#039;m able to make it.&nbsp; Oh well, rules are rules.

				The 50 posts don&#039;t have to be legit posts, you just gotta hunker down and post 50 times, no matter how little sense the posts actually make. I did it by starting a thread for dumb jokes , and just did it in 1 sitting. That was even more than is necessary but I amused myself, if no one else.

Do NOT spam just anywhere in the newbie section, look for a spam thread found by it being in the title. &#039;PLACE SPAM HERE TO GET TO 50&#039; is an example, and is the most posted thread on the forums. <br /><br />In answer to the OP q., you become a full member at 100 posts. Only 50 are needed to post in other sections however.<br /><br />Real q. is why would you not put a review here? If it really is important, you should post it here on your way to 50.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
