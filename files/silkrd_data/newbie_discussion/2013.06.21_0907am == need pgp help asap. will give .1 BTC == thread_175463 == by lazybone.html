				Download gpg4usb here : gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html, then open it and on the wizard, an option to create your own key will be on the second or third page I think. There you enter your user name, a fake or real tormail email address, set the key size to at least 2048bit and make a strong password, including lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols that&#039;s 13 characters long or more if you want it to be really secure.

				You should post in the newbie PGP thread, your more likely to get the assistance you need there. Personally, I&#039;m not computer whiz either but I followed one of the tutorials on youtube and worked a charm, maybe try searching for a tutorial specific for SR PGP use. In the mean time, try using sms4tor,http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion/ Same principle as privnote but with the added security of running through Tor.

PGP/GnuPG including privnote or any other 3rd party bullshit. any encryption you use should absolutely be OPENSOURCE! . That being said, to just browse the web privatively I guess stuff like &quot;tor2web&quot;, is OK but I would never ever use it for SR. Please correct me if I am wrong, I will not be offended, I&#039;ll be grateful. I want to help people be safe for their sake and all of our protection. I DO NOT want to spread mis-information so don&#039;t be shy.<br /><br />PGP/GPG beginners, following two tips will be helpful in reassuring yourselg you are doing it correct before using it on SR.<br /><br />**A great tool for beginners is Adele(automated account to test your PGP skills. Check it out) I&#039;ll edit with a CLEARNET link. <br />** Another very easy tip to remember is if you receive an encrypted message and have to get online to retrieve a key to decrypt it, that means it was done wrong. it was encrypted with the senders Private Key not your public key, same goes in reverse.&nbsp; *This is a SURE sign you are not doing it right, you&#039;re close but still not correct usage and not secure.<br />&nbsp;<br />* BUY THESE TWO BOOKS AND READ THEM!:&nbsp; Both are by Mike Lucas &quot;PGP &amp; GPG: Email for the Practical Paranoid&quot; The other MUST read book by M.Lucas is titled &quot;SSH Mastery: OpenSSH, PuTTY, Tunnels and Keys&quot;.<br />I bet Gen. Patreaus wished he&#039;d spent the $25 for &quot;PGP &amp; GPG ...&quot;? That&#039;s really is a good lesson, when the head of the fucking CIA doesn&#039;t even know how to keep his email private its worth taking the time to learn. Its pretty easy.<br />One last word for now about encryption and anonymity.<br />*REMEMBER, the appearance of security is much worse than the lack of it in many cases as you won&#039;t do things if you know you&#039;re not secure.<br /><br />snip<br /><br />
