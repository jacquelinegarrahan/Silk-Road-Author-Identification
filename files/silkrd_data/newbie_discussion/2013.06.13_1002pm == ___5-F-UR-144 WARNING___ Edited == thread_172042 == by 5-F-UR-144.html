				Yes there were and I read about the substance beforehand. I have had synhtetic cannibis before and never had a problem. I&#039;m not sure why I had a bad reaction because I only took one decent hit and exhaled. The problems didn&#039;t occur to well after I took it and I was in bed asleep. This is all strange because I don&#039;t recall feeling very high really.

				I have smoked 5-F-UR-144 in herbal blends before, thought it was pretty weak compared to some of the other synthetic canniboids. But have never smoked any straight chemical/powder before though.

				Well it&#039;s good to know that what happened to me is a very rel possibility for anyone. Considering the years of experience I have with so many types of drugs you&#039;d think I&#039;d be somewhat safe with this. I think it&#039;s good that some of the experiences are reported here and not just clearnet harm reduction sites. Read one story last night where the guy had so much bran damage after one use that he was basically a vegetable.
