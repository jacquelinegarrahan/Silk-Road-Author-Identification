				I didn&#039;t have a problem when I cancelled an order after it had been &#039;processing&#039; for over 10 days. You will get the same amount of bitcoins back but the monetary value of the bitcoins could be less when you receive them. In a way, yes you can lose money but you could also gain money as well.

Do you remember seeing it say &quot;hedged&quot; or &quot;unhedged&quot; by the order when you placed it? If it is hedged you get back the exact dollar amount you paid. If it is unhedged you get back the exact BTC amount you spent and depending on if BTC value went up or down you may have gained money or you may have lost money. And you can&#039;t cancel an order until 4 days after you purchased it. If you hover your cursor over the cancel option it will tell you how many days you have left before you can canel.

				when you place an order SR charges you a fee.&nbsp; This fee is usually reflected in the price of the item you&#039;re buying hence why things come up alot as 53 dollars mfor example&nbsp; when usually it&#039;d be fifty any where else&nbsp; when you place an order the three dollars in fees are taken and given to SR and the 50 is placed in escrow.&nbsp; when you cancel an order you get back what was placed in escrow and you do not get the fees back.

				What happens if the vendor cancels? Surely you don&#039;t pay the SR fee then?

Vendor cancelled 2 times for something that could have been easily resolved by just sending a message.

				That sounds most unfair seasofgreen.&nbsp; And useful to be aware of another potential pitfall.&nbsp; Presumably SR admin have a discretion in whether they charge you the commission ?

				I got a message from a 100 % vendor. No response at all after I placed my order. After a day and a half pm&#039;d to make sure order details were OK. Got a snotty message back said &#039;read my vendor page&#039; so I told him to cancel. Vendors like that are nasty ppl IRL. Not getting any karma or bitcoin from me.

				It&#039;s all 100% automatic every time you place an order.&nbsp; Anytime you place an order a percentage of the cost is sent to SR for fees.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that the SR admins are picking and choosing who gets hit with a fee it happens automatically with every order placed.&nbsp; So whether the vendor cancels or you cancel the order the fees are taken out.&nbsp; This is why it is so important to message your vendor before placing an order to make sure you are both on the same page and your order doesn&#039;t get canceled.

				Yeah, it kind of sucks that SR still has to take a fee from cancelled orders but I can kind of see it from their point too. I mean I&#039;m sure there&#039;s lots of costs associated with running a site like this and it&#039;s not like they get money from ads.&nbsp;
