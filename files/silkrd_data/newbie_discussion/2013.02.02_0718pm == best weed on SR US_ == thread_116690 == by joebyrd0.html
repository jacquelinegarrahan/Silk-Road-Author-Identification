				only ordered from two people. i usually go for lower priced but still good weed ounces for around 250. I would without a doubt buy more expensive shit but i just strapped for cash atm and made a lot of impulse buys like a nice worked mini tube<br /><br />kushcartel was great first time, but second and third order took over a week. would consider ordering from him again if he had his stuff together.<br /><br />i just ordered from brutusk, awesome guy so far. weed looks real good. ordered yesterday and hoping it comes on monday. <br /><br />messaged darkexpresso for a custom order, but he didnt seem like he wanted to help me very much (maybe cuz im not buying thousands of dollar worth of product and selling it).

				i would say, after spending A LONG ASS time checking out all the different offerings here, here&#039;s your real top picks, in no particular order:<br /><br />nuggz - sour tsunami is excellent from everything i&#039;ve heard, i&#039;ve only tried his shishkaberry and its awesome, smokes up oh so nicely<br />ogbryan - have heard nothing but great things about every nug this dude sells, and you can&#039;t go wrong with some true og kush from la<br />muskabuzz - hear tell their fleetwood og is one of the best offerings on the road, a truly unique strain<br />farmer1 - this guy&#039;s skush (og kush x skunk) is an amazing indica, and if you&#039;re like me and love a good indica, this is your dude<br /><br />all of these vendors deal with newbies, dont require FE, have actual decent prices and grow their own merch.&nbsp; order from any one of them and you will not be disappointed.&nbsp; my 2 cents

				ogbryan, farmer1 and lucymcgee all have dank weed.&nbsp; novartis also has dank weed taken directly from the top shelves of dispensaries.<br /><br />out of all the vendors i have purchased from, i would only recommend those i mentioned above.&nbsp; those four vendors are probably the cream of the crop.<br /><br />i exclude norcalking because their quality, while pretty good, does not proportionally correspond with the crazy high prices they charge.&nbsp; you can get better weed less expensively from the vendors i listed.<br /><br />

				New buyer so i only bought 2 grams from Kindbud, came in overweight and had 2 different strains, i don&#039;t know much about strains since i just smoke the shit but he had some very good purps and it came with like a gram extra of decent bud. I&#039;d suggest trying it out eventually. Currently waiting for some indica buds from BashfulBetty so hopefully that&#039;s good as well.

				The problem with this thread is after you promote a vendors product they usually raise the price. The better you and the next persons who review because of your review are, the faster it happens. Now some vendors might continue to cut you a deal as a loyal buyer but most don&#039;t. Why would they now? They have all kinds of traffic. <br /><br />I&#039;m keeping my favorites to myself, so sorry&nbsp; ;D but the beauty of SR is there are plenty of great vendors to go around.

				I&#039;d say the Eastcoastcollective. They got this weed called LSD and its like 24% THC.&nbsp; Amazing weed and a good price.&nbsp; He just came onboard with it.<br /><br />Do a search for eastcoastcollective In Silk Road and the vendor page will pop up.

The better you and the next persons who review because of your review are, the faster it happens. Now some vendors might continue to cut you a deal as a loyal buyer but most don&#039;t. Why would they now? They have all kinds of traffic. <br /><br />I&#039;m keeping my favorites to myself, so sorry&nbsp; ;D but the beauty of SR is there are plenty of great vendors to go around.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I don&#039;t change my prices! Always the same. The Pineapple Express sold out for a bit but I just added a few more ounces. <br /><br /><br />Grab some before it runs out!<br /><br />Feel free to contact me here or on the site.

				Does anyone know if WeedersDigest is a legit vendor? I was looking at his strains and prices and wanted to try the Yoda out but there is barely any posts about this vendor on the forums...I haven&#039;t placed an order yet here on SR so I don&#039;t want to get disappointed and was hoping some one could help me out and recommend some good vendors out here. Also does anyone have a site I can get BTC quick and easily?<br /><br />-Machine

				If by best you mean best quality, then I would recommend farmer1&#039;s Skush. Its the best Ive tried on the road. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4d6b278a41)<br /><br />Ive gotten 4 strains from HeartofHumboldt which were all fantastic, and their chocolate truffles are very potent. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cee4f612f5)<br /><br />HumboldtsFinest has fantastic deals on QPs of high quality bud (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5ea57f2de4)
