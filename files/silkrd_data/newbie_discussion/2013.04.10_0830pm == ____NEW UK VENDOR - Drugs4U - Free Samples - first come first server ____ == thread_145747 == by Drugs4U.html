				Hello Silk Road!<br />We are proud to announce that Drugs4U are now open for business! <br />We are looking to send out free samples of our Party Flock XTC which we want to ideally get sent out tonight.<br />First come first serve and the only requirements are that you are:<br />-Based in the UK<br />-Willing to write an honest review of our product, stealth and delivery time<br />-Have a good reputation both here and on SR (a full member of the forums ideally, 5+ TX on SR or less but big spends)<br />This is just so we can make sure our reviews come from well known reputable vendors and not fresh accounts that anyone can make as we see scams like that all the time here and want to be clear from the outset that we do not work like that.<br />Hopefully tonight we will also have a large batch of Tramadol capsules if anyone is interested in those let us know too. In the coming days we will add further listings for high quality bud and a few other excellent products. We only buy the best and only sell the best. Honesty is our main focus and we have no time for liars, cheats or scamers, If you are either of those please do not associate or do business with us.<br />Bulk to follow in due course also.<br />So who wants some free party flock tabs- these are great pills from DefQon Holland with a spread of 200-240MG of Pure Dutch MDMA and nothing more. First 5 responses will be sent out samples tonight and should arrive for Friday so you can all roll on us this weekend.<br />--- Drugs4U ---

				Billybongspecialdong - if you are in the UK and will write us a review then PM us either here or on SR and we will give you the custom listing URL.<br />And we know- its really annoying us too but we cant post on the main forum since we dont have enough posts.

				Hey guys-<br />We are trying to get all the samples out for 4.30PM so you can all roll on us this weekend.<br />Just going to make sure everything is in order on SR and we are good to go.<br />Remember that we ask for one thing in&nbsp; return- please leave a review for us, doesnt have to be long or saying we are the best, just an honest review of quality, packaging, comms etc. If you dont have time then just saying you got the 2 free sample would be enough.<br />And same for the feedback on SR, just leave us 5/5 and write a brief comment about getting the goods.<br />Its just because it is becoming harder and harder for honest vendors to gain a trusted reputation here due to the crazy amount of scamming assholes who just make fake accounts to leave feedback then rob innocent buyers who maybe don&#039;t have all that money and cant afford to be scammed.<br />We want to differentiate ourselves from those dicks and make a good name for ourselves- getting out free samples of very high quality product to you is step one.<br />If anyone does not have the 0.01BTC to place the order, just let us know on SR and we will send the coin asap so you can.<br />We have also decided to send another 5 free samples, but this time will be open to anyone, first come first serve as long as the buyer is in the UK- if not the order will be cancelled.<br />We will post here just as the listing goes live but we expect them to sell out quickly.<br />Then next week we start doing some real business and list up the best product we can get our hands on for the cheapest prices we can.<br />-Drugs-4-U-

				So far it&#039;s looking promising.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had great comms with the vendor, who has taken the time to respond to my PM comments and answer them in a thoughtful and sensible way.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting for a new test kit to turn up tomorrow and if everything goes to plan I should review it in the next few days, if not it will be next weekend.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to it :)
