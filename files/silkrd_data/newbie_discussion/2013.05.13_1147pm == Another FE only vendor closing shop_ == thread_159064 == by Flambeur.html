				Just noticed vendor [Omitted until further info] removed all listings.&nbsp; I&#039;m not accusing him of anything.... but being a FE only vendor I&#039;d hope he knows better than doing something like this without giving costumers a heads up. Specially considering all the fuzz lately.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know that I see it as a sign of things to come yet... I have seen enough posts in the past week from reading the forums before starting to post that it seems there are still enough mistakes to be made that makes it a valuable con for cons to try. <br /><br />It only goes away when it no longer turns a profit... and that being said, in some cases I can see the reality behind some vendors just saying that if you won&#039;t FE and you don&#039;t have the stats, go somewhere else. I have seen some places where its a two way street - reputable vendors being scammed by the buyer, and either being given intentionally bad ratings for no justifiable reason, or doing their best to make life difficult and trying to abuse the mediation system.<br /><br />In the end I think the response that I have seen is the best... for those that read and listen to the wisdom, they benefit from not having to face the grim result. For those that don&#039;t, its the best thing for them: chances are it was an expensive gamble that didn&#039;t pay off. Live and learn. As the scammers show their faces, the mods do what they can - but the power really is in our hands... and sometimes the reality is the only truth: you can&#039;t fix stupid.
