				Hi,<br />I&#039;m sure i&#039;m not alone in this case,to stay and search for a specific product (anything),and not find what i searching for,i&#039;ve purporsed to the SR admin the possibility to add a new categorie and he answer me to put my idea here...I hope people will come in the newb forum and read it,and to give their opinion about this idea.We can find a lot of things,SR have evoluated more and more,i know that because i&#039;m here since more than two years,less than 10 categories on the site and i was the first to purpose Ritalin and Rohypnol.And now i think to add this categorie may grow up all sellers business,make happy some buyers(sellers too),and another evolution/opportunity for SilkRoad team.<br />I&#039;m a newb on the forum,i had others account here but now there are useless...I just want some opinions (sellers-buyers or just forummer&#039;s)...<br />Personnaly i&#039;m sure it could be a great idea...<br /><br />Do not hesitate to contest my idea if you think i&#039;m wrong and if you think it could be great....<br /><br />Thanks everyone.<br />Regards.<br />PJ.

				The reason it&#039;s difficult to find things with the search feature on SR, is because of the way it&#039;s programmed. It always returns a ton of results that are not related to your terms, because it doesn&#039;t limit the results to things that contain the words you searched for. It&#039;s using a mysql like search, or something like that, so if you search for a term like &quot;red&quot; you get results that contain terms like &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;color&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot;. Instead of using mysql like, it should search all titles and descriptions for the exact individual terms in the search individually and then combine the results. A lot of people would like a sort by price feature, but first the search has to be improved so that it functions like a proper search.

				People totally use search!&nbsp; But the OP seems to be looking for a wanted items listing, which doesn&#039;t seem to fit with the model of SR.

				So could you put a &#039;bid&#039; price with your wanted listing, and then vendors could come in and put an &#039;ask&#039; price. Sounds like fun. We could have graphs showing the prices of various drugs going up and down.

				So like you want the site to remember what it is that you were looking for, like a Wish List or something?&nbsp;
