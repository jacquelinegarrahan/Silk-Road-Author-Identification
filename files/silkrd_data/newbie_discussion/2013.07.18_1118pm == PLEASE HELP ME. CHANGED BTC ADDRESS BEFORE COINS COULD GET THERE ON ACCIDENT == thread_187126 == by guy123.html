Go to www.blockchain.info (clearnet) and type the BTC address the coins were going to into the search box and hit ENTER. That will tell you information such as how many confirmations you&#039;ve had, if your coins have been transferred into your BTC address, etc. If you can&#039;t find a transaction relating to the BTC address you&#039;ve used, then no coins were sent by the Bitcoin provider. If it does show up on blockchain.info, contact SR Support as there may be an issue on SR&#039;s side.

				All old wallet addresses work.<br /><br />What do you think? Silk road just keeps the money like a vending machine that ate your dollar?<br /><br />As another user said, check the address on blockchain. If it has 6 confirmations and it hasn&#039;t made it into your wallet yet THEN start to worry.

				So this means when one hits the &quot;get new address&quot; link, there&#039;s no confirmation dialog/page ? Hmmm... Good to know...
