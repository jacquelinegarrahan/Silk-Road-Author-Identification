				Do these guys tend to bargain with their BTC prices or is it pretty much the posted price?&nbsp; In my area there are only 5 or 6 sellers and the prices seem a bit steep to me, so I am thinking that these prices are negotiable, but wanted to get some other peoples experience with this before I go in like a swap meet&nbsp; :P

				usually they aren&#039;t negotiable. i guess it all depends on supply/demand. <br />steep prices usually means little competition and few purchasers.<br />also, face to face sellers tend to sell for a higher price.<br />LL

				Yes in person.&nbsp; The bank deposit guys seem to be a bit cheaper, but I am trying to eliminate that &quot;leap of faith&quot; when buying BTC, I hate just &quot;hoping&quot; that they send the BTC when going that route, but it is good to hear that you have had successful transactions using that method.&nbsp; I may try it with a smaller sum of money.

				Person in person exploit mainly our/your need for fast bitcoins (cause througgh bank takes 2-5 days minimum)<br />and also the need for anonymity<br />so they ask more (more % profit for them than average price)<br /><br />Paypal seems not an option, cause really few accept it, till they get scammed, then they dont accept it (paypal resolution center doesnt accept digital curencies, )<br />WU might be a good option, (at least was for me) , quite instant (but it needs u to give details, as far as i know), it makes few time and u can find sellers with good prices,<br />otherwise through bank transfer&nbsp; (2-5 days miiumum usually, and in that case might be good option, register in some big site,..and after initial set up+verify+1st transaction, which might take 4-25 days....&nbsp; u can buy regularly at best prices, with 2-5 days delay)<br />Search around alone dude...

				Thanks for the replies guys.&nbsp; I was actually using bitox and was pretty happy with them, but recently they stopped taking deposits, and things got a little dicey.&nbsp; To bad because I was able to purchase BTC at a great rate and had them within hours of making a deposit.&nbsp; I will be trying the bank transfer option on localbitcoins after reading here.&nbsp;

				Per the advice on this forum I started using localbitcoins about 4 months ago. Have established a good rapport with my local supplier and am charged only 4% on transactions over $600. So if you shop around and are use some common sense when it comes to security it seems to be a rather legit route. Long gone are the days of green dots, 10% fees, and watching good BTC vendors come and go off the road.

				Interestingly enough I think my local BTC is russian mafia, but I could always be wrong. I don&#039;t want to stereotype based off the gold chains, tattoos, thick russian accent, or offer to come work for him. lol
