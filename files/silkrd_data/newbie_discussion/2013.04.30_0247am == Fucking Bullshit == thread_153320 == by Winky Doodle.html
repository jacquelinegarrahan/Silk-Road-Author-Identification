				This is fucking bullshit. I paid the same amount for x15 Vicodin as I did for a couple Roxi/oxycodone 30mg&#039;s. The roxicodones lasted all fucking day. I took the equivalent in cost and MG of this Vicodin/Hydro and the high lasted fucking 1 hour and now I barely even feel anything. What a waste of money. I&#039;m so pissed right now it isn&#039;t even fucking funny.<br /><br /><br />For everyone wanting to buy Vike&#039;s off SR, STICK TO OXY/ROXI&#039;s.

I just thought since so many people were buying them off this Pill City guy they must be pretty legit. Boy was I wrong.

FML.

Then the next kind from that were +$12 for the same pill. I decided since Pill City was selling so many Vicodin&#039;s they must be pretty good and he was ranked #1 in that section. Screw Pill City these are the most weak sauce pills I&#039;ve ever taken.<br /><br />I should of just bought from the dude that was selling Tylenol 12 pack or something for $100 instead haha.

				I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;re blaming pill city. Did they not send you the vicodins they asked for? Did they not charge you the price you agreed to?<br /><br />A chick I know LOVES xanax. It&#039;s the shit my mother takes and I have always given her plenty when I steal them. They never did shit for me. Not gonna call my mom a cunt for it.

				DO NOT take them all at once, that could be fatal. Vicodin has high doses of acetaminophen which will shred your liver.<br /><br />Look up &#039;cold water extract&#039; if you want to take all the hydro at once.

				Yo ... for me, and others i know, oxycodone is essentially 1.5 times more &quot;oopmh&quot; than hydrocodone. Hydrocodone is still very nice though. I think your problem was that you took each equal MG dose in the wrong order -- if I could go back in time for you, id say take 30 MGs of hydrocodone, and 30 MGs of oxycodone like the next day, or whatever. I technically get more mental bliss with hydro than with oxy, whereas i get a beautiful awesome body buzz with oxy. Shit I love opiates. haha<br /><br />So, in other words, roughly speaking, 30MG of oxycodone equals 45 MG of hydrocodone<br /><br />And, if you get norcos (10 mg hydro, 325 tylenol), the tylenol isnt too bad....you can take 3 or 4 and be fine. Max daily consumption of tylenol is like 3 or 4 thousand mg. Have fun chasing the dragon.
