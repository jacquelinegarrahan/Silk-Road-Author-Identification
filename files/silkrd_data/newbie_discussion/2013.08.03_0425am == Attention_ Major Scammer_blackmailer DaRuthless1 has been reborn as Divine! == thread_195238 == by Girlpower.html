				Remember one of the biggest scammers of 2013 - &quot;DaRuthless1&quot;? Who not only scammed thousands out of customers in final FE scam, but then started PASTING/POSTING customer information allover the forums? <br /><br />I have it on good authority he&#039;s back.. and I think the community needs to be warned.<br /><br />Will post details and proof..<br /><br />

				He already is. Sorry guys fell asleep last night. I just wanted to be 100% sure before I shame a vendor that he is infact the same scumbag that scammed thousands and then had the audacity to post customer information.

				If you can find the daruthless thread in here it&#039;s still on it i assume&nbsp; :-\ Provide evidence, em i&#039;m not the scammer, anyway not exactly rocket science, i typed his name in clearnet, 2nd page daruthless, silkroad vendor, clicked on it and brought up Grogoch,s shop who had a newbie thread saying he was setting up as a new vendor soon and would only be doing bulk listings, funny daruthless was 3rd person and only vendor to respond saying he&#039;d pm him, that thread will be somewhere too&nbsp; ;) I don&#039;t do things by half, and the OP is checking so if it pans out and he/she saves people being scammed then well done, should recieve a prize from SR&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Guys:<br /><br />I spent the last week conducting a little private &quot;investigation&quot; into this. And I&#039;m 110% certain about this.<br /><br />DaRuthless1 has been reborn as this vendor &quot;Divine&quot; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3c1ca02473<br /><br />SR staff/admins will know what I&#039;m talking about. Look at the images/writing style (the way they write the word &quot;Roxycodone&quot; and dates&quot; is IDENTICAL. SR will have screen shots on file from DaRuthless1&#039;s old profile. So are the &quot;Silk Road&quot; backdrop paper/boards used where the products are layed out. Literally exactly the same. ANYONE who was a customer of DaRuthless1 (or SR Staff) will immediately recognize this. <br /><br />The product listings are also IDENTICAL (identical language) as &quot;DaRuthless1&quot;.<br /><br />So is the writing style (some sections are literally copied/pasted from his previous account).<br /><br />Import &quot;Divine&quot;&#039;s PGP Key and realize it was created July 16th. About a couple days after &quot;DaRuthless1&quot; scam was uncovered and banned.<br /><br />Most importantly.. (something I can not post pictures of), but the handwriting and originating information is the SAME FROM BOTH DARUTHLESS1 AND DIVINE. When we first suspected it was this same asshole back up and running, we conducted a buy. Same packaging, same handwriting, SAME originating mailing information. <br /><br />Also, remember the &quot;Grogoch&quot; nonsense.. Divine also makes reference to a &quot;custom onion domain&quot;!!!.<br /><br />Forum name is &quot;Divine1&quot;.<br /><br />Vendor for 21 Days (RIGHT AFTER THE DARUTHLESS1 DEBACLE) and has 287 transactions!? (Fake padded feedback/similar language/similar to DaRuthless1&#039;s type style).<br /><br />**PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS GUY. HE SCAMMED PEOPLE OUT OF THOUSANDS, AND HE SAVED ALL BUYER INFORMATION AND REPEATEDLY BLASTED IT ALLOVER THE FORUMS**<br /><br />Mods/Admins/DPR please take notice! This is not just me blowing smoke.. this is all factual. SR Staff please compare the profiles and it will be 110% clear.<br /><br />I am NOT a rival vendor or a affiliated with ANY other vendor/interest. This is the truth people.<br /><br />PROTECT YOURSELVES FROM THIS MONSTER.<br /><br />SR - please take a look at this information I&#039;ve pointed out. Then go through &quot;Divine1&quot;s PM&#039;s and it compare his language (Identical) to that of &quot;DaRuthless1&quot;.<br />Sure theres nothing in the rules against banned vendors from being re-born and creating a new account.. but THIS particular person REALLY fucked the community over, and ontop of that is capable (and HAS) saved buyer information and then plastered it allover the forums! <br /><br />You&#039;re welcome guys. I hope I saved people from losing THOUSANDS of dollars from this confirmed shitball scam artist, and most importantly safe from having YOUR information blasted allover the place.<br /><br />Do I get some kind of prize for this?! A reward?&nbsp; 8)

				I guess it&#039;s possible. DR1 always sold IR 30&#039;s and suboxone , nothing else until he decided to pull his scam. At that point he had pounds and pounds of weed and a shitload of coke....all fictitious of course. This Divine dude has, supposedly, a bunch of weed . DR1 never really had or claimed to have weed, till the end. I&#039;m not saying your wrong, just that there are differences. I just received an order from Divine yesterday.

				The paper/board printouts of &quot;Silk Road&quot; with the green camel logo that he has the product laid out with the name/dosage/date.. it is THE EXACT SAME as DaRuthless1. Same handwriting, same printout. SR has the screen shots of DaRuthless1&#039;s profile. That&#039;s just 1 of the smoking guns.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s worse.. the fact that $10s of thousands of dollars was scammed in his &quot;FE&quot; &quot;blowout sale&quot; scam, or that he started posting buyer information allover the forums in some attempt to extort DPR into giving him his account back.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3c1ca02473 (Divine) = DaRuthless1 !!!!<br /><br />Will someone from Silk Road administration please take serious note and analyze the evidence. <br /><br />All those scammed by DaRuthless1, PLEASE go to &quot;Divine&quot;&#039;s profile http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3c1ca02473 <br />and it will take you all but 2 minutes for your jaw to drop at the nerve of how he is BLATANTLY the same person.<br /><br />

Obvious, no?<br /><br />You MUST realize, this guy saved your information last time, and is doing it allover again. Do you all think that DR1 is somehow a REFORMED human being and is back as Divine to play by the rules this time around? NO! He will rob and scam again. He will save information/blackmail again.<br /><br />DR1 had the same products as this guy (as the poster said) and right before his major scam he had all this weed (which Divine has). Oh, yeah.. THE STRAINS OF WEED WERE THE EXACT SAME.<br /><br />I could not live with myself if I had not came forward with all this information..

I just received an order from Divine yesterday.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes. It IS him. Without getting into specifics, please remember the handwriting/packaging of DR1&#039;s, and look at the package/order you received from Divine.<br />Now look at the profile. BAM! Obvious, no?<br /><br />You MUST realize, this guy saved your information last time, and is doing it allover again. Do you all think that DR1 is somehow a REFORMED human being and is back as Divine to play by the rules this time around? NO! He will rob and scam again. He will save information/blackmail again.<br /><br />DR1 had the same products as this guy (as the poster said) and right before his major scam he had all this weed (which Divine has). Oh, yeah.. THE STRAINS OF WEED WERE THE EXACT SAME.<br /><br />I could not live with myself if I had not came forward with all this information.. I hope I have saved the community and SR itself from another nightmare.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not doubting you at all. I wish I saved the packaging materials from my order but I always get rid of that stuff asap. Just the possibility that this is DR1 is enough for me to look elsewhere, why chance it? There are plenty of IR vendors on here.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t catch me in his scam but he tried. He told me in PM that if I ordered an 8ball of his new C that he would send me a 1/4........right . Of course, it had to be FE. It&#039;s really too bad because B4 going rogue, DR1 was a good vendor,&nbsp; but I guess thats the point, gain the trust then fuckem.

				Well if anyone DOES want to help me re-cuperate the costs of my investigation (I use the term costs loosely. Once I put all the pieces together that &quot;Divine&quot; was &quot;DaRuthless1&quot; I did decide to place an order and spend some coin to compare handwriting/packaging before coming to the forums).. I won&#039;t stop anyone from helping a gal out : 14YnxEfCu68Z4s1muFLysavVsjjbjmZ5oy<br /><br />BUT.. saving the community from this shitbag and keeping another massive scam/buyer info dump from happening is itself rewarding.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

This is utterly insane, What because we took business from other vendors we don&#039;t even have a fair hearing we just become terminated as vendors?!?! We worked hard at doing our job! we did a damn good one to and we come online to see our seller status has been revoked?!!? <br /><br />CAN SOMEONE PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS WE HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG AND PLEASE SHOW US PROOF WE ARE THIS PERSON!?!?!?

LIES! we have worked hard to get where we are in the last 30 days! <br /><br />We also sell other goods but didn&#039;t think they would sell on here but mark on words if that will make everyone understand were not this ruthless person than so be it because we saw someone say something about weed, We&#039;ve been selling and shipping weed for over 5 years now and between the 3 of us it&#039;s almost 30 years worth of shipping and selling!<br /><br />Why doesn&#039;t SR look into our withdrawl address&#039;s and see if they match up with anyone who every used SR before because we will bet our BTC address&#039;s are brand new since we just opened our god damn account. <br /><br />We are very pissed considering one person&#039;s word can cause this much damage AND they don&#039;t even have 50 posts people!<br /><br />We went out last night to celebrate this week&#039;s sales since we did over 10k in sales and we went out to have a good time and now this?<br /><br />BTW my name is JOHN! I am the owner of DIVINE, I have 3 other partners but I run the show and you will speak with me until things are figured out because this is not the last you will hear from us as we roar and will not let someone who wants 3BTC win! we refuse to let someone extort us or even let them swindle the SR staff or DPR to think we are someone else when they just are mad because they are a vendor who lost sales!<br /><br />COME ON PEOPLE DONT GIVE IN TO THIS NON SENSE BEFORE HEARING US! <br /><br />ASK ANY ONE OF OUR BUYERS, IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH A ORDER WE MADE IT RIGHT, WHY WOULD WE COME HERE AND WRITE ANY OF THIS IF WE WERE GUILTY!?!? <br /><br />AGAIN WHAT DID WE DO WRONG AND HOW IS THIS PROOF ?!?!?

				I just purchased sub from Divine this week..<br /><br />I went thru his feedback before ordering and there were lottoes he had, so his amount of feedback isn&#039;t odd.<br /><br />I have no experience with daruthless, but I have buying sub..<br /><br />My experience with divine was this..messaged asking if I order by 3EST if it would go out that day..they responded yes..I ordered.. About 24 hrs later order arrives, it was not what I ordered...I messaged right away and Divine responded, reshipped my order +1 extra and next day I have my correct order and an extra..<br /><br />I was treated more then fairly, professionally and quite happy..<br /><br />If I recall daruthless sold strips of sub, I hadn&#039;t seen the sub Divine had listed on SR before. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what else to say except it was one of the best transactions I had even with the error..<br /><br />

I do not have a horse in this race and only want the best for our community. Just try to stay calm. If these claims are baseless that sucks for now, but you should be able to be reinstated.

So how does my partners wife&#039;s handwriting compare to someone who scammed people? <br /><br />We will state our case but it is clear as day when SR support or whom ever goes and looks into the messages sent by girlpower and those screenshots we provided since we didn&#039;t check the privnote.com messages till just a little while ago.<br /><br />You said just be honest? We have been utterly honest and it is kind of sad for us to be brought to our knee&#039;s like this but how can we lie?!?

				In the end I&nbsp; believe that the Road admin will come to a fair and proper decision in this matter. I had dealings with DR1, and I placed an order, a successful order with Divine this week. I gotta say, Through reading his posts on this thread, I don&#039;t get the impression that Divine has any similarities to DR1 as far as writing style and phrasing n such .&nbsp; To make accusations like this, GP should really have some strong evidence because this can literally ruin someones business . The flip side of that is IF it&#039;s true, then....ruin away, it&#039;s well deserved. <br />I personally hope Divine is proven innocent in the end as he&#039;s been a good vendor so far.

				Silk Road has the DaRuthless1 profile screen shots, as do they have his PM&#039;s and communications. <br />Divine.. you&#039;re not him right.. and you don&#039;t want to come forward to the community and confess and return the money of everyone you robbed (and apologize for plastering their fucking information allover the forums).. right? So then why worry?<br /><br />Once they compare the old profile (handwriting AND the piece of paper printed Silk Road that contains the words &quot;oxycodone 30mg&quot; etc), and compare the way you speak on PM .. they&#039;ll realize that you&#039;re NOT the same guy, right? So then... why so upset?<br /><br />You know VERY well what&#039;s going to happen/is happening..<br /><br />As for the morons coming out at to show this guy &quot;support&quot;. Thats fine. Please READ the thread on DaRuthless1 and what he did. Then we&#039;ll see how much &#039;support&#039; you&#039;ll willing to give him or wheether you will RUN for the hills.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow this is some shit, We went to go eat since we didn&#039;t eat breakfast and come back to see all these posts<br /><br />We thank the guy who said they are the real ruthless person as we are 100% the mods can confirm we haven&#039;t closed our browser or have any connection even IP wise to this person. Just putting it out there because we thought it would get said that we were the poster of that.<br /><br />Thank you guys for coming in here to back us up, If any posters have 1-2 posts and are backing us up is because we asked them to come in this thread and back us up and if you were to go back to the previous pages you will see where we stated we messaged over 100 of our buyers to inform them of what is going on. SR staff can check the username&#039;s on SR and see if they match up so that no one can say that they are &quot;shill&quot; account which we don&#039;t even know what that means but were assuming here and going to say &quot;shit&quot;? meaning its not real? <br /><br />We aren&#039;t going to respond to stupid responses nor are we going to continue to stress ourselves out over something we know will be cleared up once DPR or another staff member who has the power to reinstate our account comes to there senses and reads the messages this girlpower person sent since in our messages they out right said how about 3btc after we ignored their messages because after reading the privnote messages they wanted 5btc first and then dropped it to 3btc which again it clearly states in the messages and on top of it all GP had the nerve to message us again saying this:<br /><br />&quot;Extorted? I just want you to admit you&#039;re the asshole that ROBBED everyone INCLUDING me. And RETURN MY MONEY AS WELL AS OTHERS. You used the SAME backdrop and handwriting for your pictures idiot!&quot;<br /><br />The message before that was:<br /><br />&quot;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195238.0&quot; &lt;-- Going to say that was to show us what they have started<br /><br />The message before that was:<br /><br />&quot;dunno if the last msg came thru: https://privnote.com/n/ktkghpbmlybdhtpx/#tnlbkiqehdehtbnh&quot;<br /><br />Then:<br />&quot;You sure about that? You realize what will happen once I alert SR admins/mods/DPR/community?<br />All over 3 BTC? You&#039;re positive, right?<br /><br />Just check that thread then.&quot;<br /><br />The first message was:<br /><br />https://privnote.com/n/ildpmkvkwkzadyje/#trsemedlpywuasyz &lt;-- We responded umm no :P because we don&#039;t read privnote messages unless its someone address, We did not check those URLS given to us until we saw this thread which we also took screenshots of and once again SR mods if they can or will chime in here at some point will confirm these messages were sent from the account &quot;GirlPower&quot; and when they do we will have so much enjoyment because by that time we will also have our account and listings back up.<br /><br />So continue with your redundant posts, No one is siding with you anymore since we have made our claims 100% and provided evidence unlike you who did not, Better yet we said we weren&#039;t going to entertain you and we won&#039;t.<br /><br />Thank you for all those who still have faith in us! You will be blessed dearly with our goods once our listings are back up we will be going through this thread to keep record on who backed us up and we will be sure to send them whatever their drug of choice is and this only applies to buyers we already have done business with as we asked you to come here and back us up since you were blessed with our services.<br /><br />DIVINE

Yes, I privnoted you telling you that I know it&#039;s you, and to refund the money you made me FE and robbed me off as DaRuthless1, and I gave you a timeframe to confess to SR publically, apologize, and offer to return anyone elses&#039;s money. That&#039;s EXACTLY what was said in the privnote, and you know it. Sending yourself a privnote and screenshotting it is so silly that it&#039;s beneath my dignity to even respond.<br /><br />But hey, you have nothing to worry about, right DR1? Nothing at all. Let SR conclude their investigation and when all is said and done let&#039;s see what you have to say. Karma is a BITCH Dr1.

				I ordered from DaRuthless1 a few months ago and from Divine just last week. During those transactions I had some PM conversations with them both. I thought their writing styles were pretty different, for what it&#039;s worth.<br /><br />My transaction with Divine was flawless, friendly, and super-fast. I&#039;d order from him again in a heartbeat. I can only make decisions based on my own experience, and so far, my experience with him has been very positive. If I get ripped off by him (or anyone else) going forward, I&#039;ll definitely post about it.&nbsp; Getting ripped off is the risk we all accept when we do business here. But as long as we play by the SR rules, the risk is fairly low, considering what we&#039;re all doing here.&nbsp; <br /><br />There have been a lot of scams here lately (I got burned by TheRealRickGrimes last month; learned my lesson), so it&#039;s understandable that everyone is nervous and being extra-cautious. I appreciate the SR staff looking into this and doing what they can to protect us from the jerks, and clearing the names of the non-jerks. <br /><br />Now everyone go smoke a bowl and pet your cat. You&#039;ll feel better.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />-ck

And you know VERY well those are the SAME backdrops and same handwriting that SR can compare to DaRuthless1&#039;s pictures.<br /><br />As for the privnotes, I just saw what you posted up here. That is NOT what I sent you. Shall I take a screen shot of your response to my &quot;privnotes&quot;? You&#039;re &quot;umm no :P&quot;?<br /><br />I did privnote this fucker because there was information that had to do with AN ORDER OF MINE IN WHICH HE ROBBED ME OF 3 BITCOINS during his DaRuthless1 SCAM!<br /><br />I DID NOT WANT ORDER INFORMATION THAT CAN BE LINKED TO ME STORED IN SR. THATS THE *ONLY* REASON WHY I USED PRIVNOTE. AND I DEMANDED HE COME FORWARD AND CONFESS ITS HIM, OR ELSE I WILL OUT HIM ON THE FORUMS AND TO REPAY BACK EVERYONE HE FUCKING RIPPED OFF LAST MONTH STARTING WITH ME.<br /><br />Whatever bogus privnote this asshole screen shoted is hilarious. I am in touch with SR and they KNOW this guy is DaRuthless1.<br /><br />Keep saying &quot;we&quot; all you want dude.. it doesn&#039;t make you not your oldself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not taking anyones side but its clear that Girlpower has other motivations. He can give no excuse why he is sending privnotes, because there is no excuse. Your sending privnotes because your afraid that SR could see what you say.<br /><br />You really dont know who this guy is but your sad because someone took your money. Thats understandable but you have no expertise in this area. It shows alot about who you are because you made up a name, why not use your regular forum name????????? is it because you know that the truth may come out and you dont want your regular name associated with this incident?<br /><br />How much are you trying to extort divine for, 3 bitcoin? <br /><br />I could care one way or the other but I did get a successful order from divine yesterday. <br /><br />I am not taking the time to read everything but all I need to read is the fact you admit to sending privnotes then you come up with some weird story that doesnt make alot of sense.<br /><br />The reason you sent privnotes is because you didnt want SR to see what you were telling him.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Exactly correct. I was one of the people who got burned by his DaRuthless1 account and FE&#039;d for about $350 + shipping. He has plastered customer information a few weeks ago on the forums. I privnoted him because I DO NOT want my order details (which link back to my buyer information) ANYWHERE. I learned that lesson thanks to DR1. So there is no &quot;ulterior&quot; motive. <br /><br />I am sure you got a successful order from Divine, as HAVE I. I also had a successful order from DaRuthless1, before I got scammed along with dozens of others out of thousands of dollars. Please search the forums for that entire situation. I don&#039;t have other motivations, I simply want MY money back and for this guy to come clean about him being DaRuthless1, hopefully return others money, and be punished for what he did.<br /><br />Using privnote is the only sane and safe option to address what he did, as what did you want me to say in plain text &quot;I am customer XYZ that you ripped for for X amount. Pay it back&quot;. So then SR, when they investigate this fuck (which they are doing RIGHT NOW), also know details of my buyer history (which was posted on the forums along with other buyers)?. No way, no chance, not in this lifetime. <br /><br />Divine/DaRuthless1 knows I busted him and that SR is also nearly totally certain its the same monster back at it. If I wanted to &quot;extort&quot; the man for 3 bitcoins, I would simple order and &quot;extort&quot; him over feedback, no? <br /><br />My safety and security come first. I trust SR and the support/administration, but I am not about to pinpoint who I am to a demonstrated psyschopath by plaintexting information that can identify me. Not going to happen.<br /><br />You ordered from DaRuthless1 a few months ago.. great. You understand what a &quot;long con&quot; is? You recall that he had impeccable feedback until he pulled his FE scam and devastated a lot of people out of their money?<br /><br />I am sure Divine&#039;s MO is the same as his previous life as DaRuthless1. Build a solid reputation, then pull a &quot;runner&quot;. Since you ordered from him before, you must realize the EXACT SAME BACKDROP and HANDWRITING on his product pictures, right?<br /><br />Silk Road does NOT suspend an account and investigate/pull records because of an accusation on a forum. That&#039;s not how it works children. They know, and HE knows that he&#039;s caught.

				I find it an odd coincidence that DR1, if that was really him, came out to defend Divine. Why would he ever show up here again, at least as himself?? Then Divine mentions his browser not closing, he could have easily used a different computer right??? To me, thats pretty damning right there that DR1 showed up like that.

				Also what happen to &#039;benzokings&#039; post?<br /><br />He had a very valid point about anyone sending a message having a privnote.com URL in there means there is something you want to say but don&#039;t want SR to see it. You already owned up to using privnote.com after you said you didn&#039;t, Now just to fess up to trying to extort us for 3/5BTC<br /><br />Also &#039;benzoking&#039; brought up a good point about something else being at work here because his post just disappeared? What because he was a vendor and has been for over a year and someone like that backing us up isn&#039;t good? I mean we just saw the post now its gone?!? <br /><br />Is the head guy DPR aware that you guys are playing with the forums now?&nbsp; He had valid points but his post is gone? <br /><br />I really hope we aren&#039;t being bullied not to vend here on SR because that&#039;s just not right and someone needs to step in here and put there foot down on this situation because we&#039;ve been patient and did get a little angry but we know were not this person so we are not going to entertain this &quot;GirlPower&quot; person even if it does mean we don&#039;t have our vendor status given back to us, We rather lose our vendor status then to pay anyone any amount of money. <br /><br />Are you just trying to prove a point now? <br /><br />We wish there was a way for us to prove were not this ruthless person but other than our word nothing else can be said here and those who are sticking behind us GOD BLESS YOU and for all those who think were this ruthless person we want you to know we would never scam you or do anything with your personal information since we do buy stuff on here to :P Why would we want to do any of these negative things when we purchase goods here also?<br /><br />Its sunday and all this for 5btc?<br /><br />We been trying to let the forums and the people decide but it seems people&#039;s post&#039;s are be deleted by someone? So we just wanted to clear the air and say what we needed to say since today is god&#039;s day and we did not go to church today because of this so we rather go for the evening mass and pray things will work out.<br /><br />Yes we know were drugs dealers who go to church and believe in karma a lot so we will pray for all those souls trying to harm us and we hope you will see the light as we have!<br /><br />Also were usually sign off on messages like so<br /><br />Thank You<br /><br />Divine

				I think you may be underestimating how much me pulled off in that scam. Im sure he had his account on auto w/d so I doubt thye got much if any from his DR1 account. Who knows how many of them were his own fake buys but i would not be surprised if he walked away with 50k+ I think tht may even be a low estimate. It was sick how many people were jumping all over his &quot;great deals&quot;

				well hell.&nbsp; I logged on to make another speedy order from Divine and found I cant.

I feel like Catwoman or something right about now.. having saved the day. hehehe..<br /><br />I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll want to be back, but that looks increasingly hard. $10k in escrow means that most likely SR will either refund that money to buyers, or confiscate it. I think both options are equally appropriate fair. Sucks that the people like us who got screwed over by this living piece-of-shit had to pay a serious price.. but I truly feel happy for those that were undoubtedly saved from a future scam (that he would inevitably have attempted).<br /><br />If he has $10k in escrow, AND had money in escrow at the time of his last scam, it will be increasingly hard for this cunt to be able to restart his operation while his dough is all tied up. And IF he tries, I&#039;ll catch him again. His language/typing is a very, very distinct form of &#039;retard&#039; that&#039;s just not hard to spot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for what you&#039;ve done here, very brave.<br /><br />A word of advice: you might want to DBAN your computer or take more precautions in case of LE. Someone who just lost 10k in escrow and who has your address might be dangerous to you. Just be careful.<br /><br />Edit: And I seriously hope that Divine/DaRuthless1 indulges us with an &quot;end of Scoobydoo episode&quot;-esque post. <br />If it weren&#039;t for you meddling kids...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm.. true. But we&#039;re west coast and he is east coast.. so good luck coming all the way here. Oh, that and my boyfriend is armed to the teeth.. he&#039;d rather play with his glocks and ar15&#039;s then his xbox! But I digress..<br /><br />And I&#039;m positive Divine/DaRuthless1 will come on here and chime in. Hopefully.. if he&#039;s got any morals, he&#039;ll apologize and take it like a man, and hell, even offer to make it right with all those he scammed. doubt that will happen.. but 1 can dream!<br /><br />I got burned in his last grand scam.. and saw that a shocking number of people also fell for his robbery. When I saw he was back in action under a new profile, I devised a plan to investigate, gather the proof, wait patiently, and then expose him for what he was when the time was right. I chose the weekend because I figured people would not be ordering (that much) due to his profile stating he did not process orders on the weekend, so I knew that once I set the ball in motion he would not be able to frantically pull a quick FE scam on all his customers and invent more &quot;too good to be true deals&quot; (that would ofcourse require FE) and make out like a bandit - again.<br /><br />I put a lot of planning into this. <br /><br />SR/DPR - if you folks want to hire me as a Scammer-Vendor-Exposer, I will sign right up! :-*

This man has been confirmed by the Silk Road Administration of being the SAME person who (only a few weeks ago), scammed people out of $50,000 + in funds and upon being caught, started pasting his BUYER INFORMATION (which he saved) allover the forums in an attempt to extort Dread Pirate Roberts for his stolen funds back.<br /><br />The fact that he spent months building a solid reputation (by conducting transactions flawlessly as the ones you describe) only makes his devastating scam that much more horrific to all the people who were fucked over (including me and dozens others). Not to mention having our personal information plastered allover these forums. <br /><br />*YOU* have just been saved from an immoral monster who very would have stolen your money at some point (BEST case scenario), or put your security/life in danger (WORST case scenario).<br /><br />Yeah, you&#039;re welcome.

				That&#039;s true that it DOES take &quot;two to tango&quot; in terms of FE, which means you probably wouldn&#039;t have been robbed.

				Good point, both of you. I was extremely cautious, however, and thorough in my investigation. I would never have presented the facts/evidence on a whim. I made 110% certain that this vendor was in fact the same guy before I came forward to the community/SR because obviously.. had he be innocent, such accusations could have been a disaster and harmed someone&#039;s business.<br /><br />The personal vitriol was really because I was scammed (amongst others) during his grand FE scam. Although my loss was peanuts compared to the most likely 50k+ he robbed other customers of.. I think there is no doubt that the man was the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Thievery aside.. the attempted &quot;extortion&quot; of DPR and SR by plastering his customer information allover the forums could have set a very dangerous precedent.<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad that Silk Road has shut him down, and hopefully for good this time. If he tries to re-invent himself again, I will nail him again. No regrets.

What GP did was honorable, but the way she did it and her all around demeanor is just childish. &quot;I figured it out! Pay me! Give me rewards! Hire me as a detective! I feel like a superhero! I feel like catwoman! You all owe me thanks and praise!&quot; etc... <br /><br />Some people understand the value of being humble and GP is not one of these people. Yes, thank you Girlpower for preventing a potential scam from being run on our community. But, at the same time you are a bug douche who can&#039;t stop patting yourself on the back for it.

				This community has many members who have 3000+ posts in some cases. Many of those posts have been of them helping out newcomers learn and navigate their way through the process. These people do this selflessly and for no &#039;reward.&#039; Girlpower is not one of these people. Girlpower was ripped off in an FE scam, her own fault, and is mad about it (understandably). Fortunately she came across the same vendor under a different name, realized it was him and let the community know. All this is great..<br /><br />After that she acted and continues to act like a boastful 15 year old. I would suggest simply deleting this entire thread, but there is no way that would happen. Then she wouldn&#039;t be able to show it to people and tell them how great she is..

				Wow. That&#039;s pretty harsh. I&#039;m being made to feel like I did something wrong? Please realize I have put my own personal safety at serious risk by exposing this person.

				@turkeyforbreakfast...C&#039;mon she should be proud of herself, she,s saved the community from this scumbag. People should be greatful, she,s went to the bother of ordering from them 1st and checking everything and she was proven to be right so i,ll give her a virtual pat on the back anyway, she put time and effort into this and imo just got a little excited when it was proven she was right lol I don,t think she deserves shit for it&nbsp; ;)

My posts are far from that of a &#039;pathetic dripping cunt rag.&#039; My account is far older than any of the issues surrounding DaRuthless1, Divine etc, so calling it a shill account is laughable... Also if you had read the posts as you claim I challenge you to find the one where I defended the now proven scammer? Prior to evidence I stated we should wait for the facts and the results... Hardly a shill, sounds more like a reasonable response to me.. I do not use any of the items this person is said to have sold either, so I won&#039;t be crying... And even if I did like I imagine others do, can&#039;t they simply buy them from any of the other vendors? So why would anyone cry about not being able to purchase from this vendor who is now a proven scammer? <br /><br />This is just silly..<br /><br />&lt;----I am a Hero. Fact.

It&#039;s all about emotions and personality; nothing that Girlpower did indicated (to me) that she wanted to impress anyone. When you&#039;re reading these forums, try to remember communicating over the internet isn&#039;t perfect. You&#039;re reading words that someone wrote, and not everyone has enough intelligence to deduce the tone that someone is using. But it&#039;s pretty clear with Girlpower that her words and her tone all come from emotion (getting hyped up from spotting DaRuthless, putting it altogether, forwarding it to SR, winning, communicating with daruthless). Nothing that she said about rewards was said in a serious tone.

				I think the one lesson we can all learn here is CHRIST don&#039;t ever cross girlpower/conno******, LOL, she went to some lengths here, and why not.She was de-frauded and she wouldn&#039;t have it and came back fighting. What spirit, if half the community had that much&nbsp; heart, we would all be free from scammers. She deserves a medal, even putting a lot of effort in with the fake buys and not going out on a whim, she found your solid, incontrovertible&nbsp; evidence, and she did it while anonymous. Just because she got caught in the moment when Lib confirmed her suspicions, it doesn&#039;t detract from the sterling work she undertook. And she could smell the pray, so why couldn&#039;t&nbsp; she act like a wild animal with her spoils. I&#039;m glad DR1/Devine was clamped and shut down uber fast, Like she said Karma&#039;s a bitch.<br /><br />
