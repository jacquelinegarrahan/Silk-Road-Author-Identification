				First time shopper here, regular on ATL..&nbsp; Sent 4.xx BTC to my SR account last night, woke up this AM to buy my bud and still no BTC.&nbsp; Checked the deposit address on blockchain and it received my BTC but, my account still shows 0.&nbsp; It&#039;s had well over 30+ confirmations as well.&nbsp; I did send a message to support staff, just wondering if this is usual so I can plan for it or if I&#039;m just unlucky this time.<br /><br />Thanks!

				As you can see (you can, right?) there are plenty of threads with similar problems. Your best bet is to wait a bit longer.

				Its been 11+ hours and 74 confirmations, still not shown up. <br /><br />Its weird because it shows they were received on blockchain and then withdrawn and the final balance is zero. I used blockchain&#039;s mixing service and did a custom send, so I am afraid I messed something up. I have used blockchain before but only ever used the quick send. Any help?

				I think SR&#039;s processing seems to have picked up within the last few minutes. I could be wrong, but watch your balances it could be good news. These things do happen sometimes, but as long as you&#039;ve used the right BTC address you&#039;ll be fine.

				If things are perfect it takes about 2 hours. But any transfer can take up to 48 hours and from you sending to the BTC being in your account multiple transfers and tumbles take place. If you sent to the right address your BTC will get to your account, but iot may take a while relax and peruse.&nbsp; &nbsp;
