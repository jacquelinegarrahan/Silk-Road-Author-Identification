				I recently picked up a couple grams of allegedly uncut blow chipped right off a brick from a vendor who shall remain un-named on SR. I&#039;m pretty happy with the high - it seems pretty strong, and there&#039;s just a bit of an edge to it, but I&#039;m not feeling jittery, even after ripping lines for a good 30 of the past 48 hours. But in comparing it with a purchase from the same vendor, different batch (which was very clean), it seems a little...off. <br /><br />First, it definitely has that coke smell and taste, but they&#039;re overwhelmed by a powerful gasoline stink. I&#039;ve certainly experienced it before, and I know it&#039;s due to gasoline being used as the organic solvent during the initial stages of extraction, but this smell is a little over the top. <br /><br />Second, unlike the other batch, this stuff burns a bit going up - not as bad as some of the more stepped on shit I&#039;ve had in the past - and then within about 30 minutes, just as the high begins to fade a little, my nose starts to run like a faucet. I&#039;ve never experienced anything quite like it. No clog, just torrents of thin, clear mucous. I destroyed a box of 100 tissues today! <br /><br />Third, it made my nose bleed, which could be due to somewhat higher than normal use, but it didn&#039;t happen with the prior batch that I used at a similar rate. I&#039;ve heard really good coke won&#039;t do this. <br /><br />Fourth (bear with me here, this is about it!), I noticed that after doing a numbie and just casually wiping my finger off, a bit later I can see some tiny sparkles where the coke had dissolved. The other stuff didn&#039;t do the same thing. I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s unlikely that the stuff either didn&#039;t dissolve at all - assuming it&#039;s mostly actual cocaine hcl - or that it recrystalized out of my evaporating saliva. Could it be crushed glass, or is that just propaganda?<br /><br />Finally, there&#039;s the aforementioned edge...again, mild, and I might not have noticed if the other batch hadn&#039;t been so mellow and clean. <br /><br />So, does anyone know what might account for these differences between two different bricks, right off the boat? The vendor is reputable and has been around forever with awesome feedback that passes the bullshit test. He confirmed that my orders were from different batches and said he hadn&#039;t heard anything negative. Not sure how much weight that carries, though. I&#039;m pretty certain manufacturing differences probably account for it, but what are those differences? I&#039;ve heard that these days, a lot of blow is cut by the cartels before it leaves the source country, and often that&#039;s where the levamisole is added. <br /><br />Sorry for the fucking novel. As you may have guessed, I&#039;m pretty damn high. Thanks for reading, and please, share your knowledge and wisdom, while at the same time helping us get to 50.<br /><br />Cheers!

By last night, a runny nose had turned into serious irritation. Tooting another line up each side would numb everything up and pucker up whatever membranes unleashed all that snot, but a half hour later, I&#039;d be fucked again. It took about 3 hours for the burn and the waterfall to subside enough that I could focus on something other than the misery. I&#039;ll definitely talk the vendor again today and try to push for some kind of compensation for the suffering.<br /><br />Does anyone think I might have any luck with an acetone wash? At this point, I have probably a g left, and I&#039;m not sure it&#039;d be worth the trouble. But at the same time, it might be a fun experiment. I might also see what I get out of sublingual administration, though at this point, I wonder if it&#039;ll just make my gums bleed!

				Would you say the residue looks like salt, or a similar crystalline substance?<br /><br />If so, then I have come across this many times.&nbsp; I have been shooting up coke on and off for years, and I actually picked up a bag locally yesterday, because I had that fucking urge to shoot...&nbsp; And the coke had that clearish non-water soluble cut.&nbsp; I have melted it down in water with a bit of heat and shot it, but it didn&#039;t really do much..&nbsp; SO I am not sure what to make of it either.

				I am not that experienced with cocaine actually. but can it be cut with The local anesthetic that dentist use? Its used so it numbs better in the gum. cant imagine that being good for the nose, as you said&nbsp; you bled from the nose and so on.

				Water test confirms a very fine substance that sparkles settles at the bottom. No amount or stirring or heat caused it to dissolve. Bummer.

He&#039;s doing some tests himself, and if it turns out I&#039;m not off my rocker - who know, right? ;) - I&#039;ve no doubt he&#039;ll make it right.

				So maybe my nose was what wasn&#039;t quite right. Took a couple days off, and tried a few lines today. A little burn, but nothing horrible like before. Now I feel like an ass for pestering the vendor, who, to his credit, was very patient.
