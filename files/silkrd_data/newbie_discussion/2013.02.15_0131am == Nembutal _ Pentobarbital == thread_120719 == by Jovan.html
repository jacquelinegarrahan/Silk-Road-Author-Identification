			<dd class="postbody">
				For the past several years I have intermittently tried to obtain Nembutal, and just a couple of days ago I found my way here, on silk road. I&#039;m having a hard time finding a good, reliable source. Before finding out about Silk Road and online sources of Nembutal, I was planning on flying to Peru to purchase it in person. Anyways, after searching through these very forums, I found several other posts regarding the subject. Some people have dropped hints that you can find reliable sources of&nbsp; powdered nembutal in China, and that it can get shipped directly to your home. This information is also confirmed by Exit International, which performed tests on 4 sources of powdered nembutal from China - and all of the tests came out positive. There is indeed good quality stuff available there, and you don&#039;t need to fly to another country to pick it up.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found a few websites where Chinese vendors appear to be shipping powdered nembutal, but the websites look very untrustworthy to me. I&#039;ve mostly been googling for &quot;chinese nembutal&quot;, &quot;powdered nembutal&quot; and combinations of &quot;Pentobarbital Sodium Nembutal Cas No 57-33-0&quot; &lt;- that cas number means high-purity/quality stuff.<br /><br />Could anyone please direct me towards a reliable source, help me think of better keywords to google for, or perhaps share any tips on finding a reliable source? I just don&#039;t want to get scammed for several hundred dollars, and it seems that even here on Silk Road, that this stuff is hard to find.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a couple links to supposed online sellers. I don&#039;t want to start dropping money on this unless I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s not a scam. <br /><br />http://ua.anuncioo.com/yard-depot/for-sale/collector-s-items/zhytomyrs-ka-oblast/narodychi/pentobarbital-sodium-nembutal-cas-no-57-33-0-3392632<br /><br />http://wecoochem.vvchem.com/show-3260637.html

				I am still looking for Nembutal. I paid $100 to become a member of exit international. They only allow you to join their forums if you are over the age of 50, which I am unfortunately not. I have applied anyway, but it&#039;s been about a week now and their site administrators have yet to get back to me. Hopefully I can gain access to their forums because I believe they hold a wealth of information on how to obtain nembutal. In the mean time I am returning here, silk road forums, to bump this thread and request that a moderator delete the spam posts in this thread. Hopefully I can get some more information on how to obtain it. I&#039;ve come across more websites that supposedly sell the drug, but they are very shady. This one for example says they sell nembutal and cocain: http://www.tradett.com/product/u83972p748952/nembutal.html<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if I can trust those kinds of sites. I honestly might just bite the bullet and dish out a couple grand to make a trip to peru and purchase it there. I&#039;ve been reading some old articles that state you can take a cruise or visit a resort in mexico and make a trip into one of the safer cities and obtain it there, although I&#039;m not sure. Those articles are old, and the more people catch on to what&#039;s happening, I think the less likely you will be able to obtain it, even in mexico. Not as many people seem to know about peru. <br /><br />One of the issues with getting it in peru is smuggling it across the border. I risk a lot by doing that. I don&#039;t want to use my nembutal as soon as I get it. I just want to store it in case I need it in the future. So obtaining it in person is not ideal for a lot of reasons. Also, there&#039;s language barriers which would make it difficult as well :(<br /><br />This is proving to be a very challenging problem for me, but I will continue to make efforts to obtain it and I will update this thread as long as it&#039;s okay with the forum mods. I believe that knowledge is free, and I am willing to share what I know.<br /><br />If exit international doesn&#039;t get back to me within a few more days, I will email their administrators about the status of my forum application. In the mean time I am still searching through the web, reading articles. About a year ago I was looking at the costs of flying to peru and the places around there. I might just learn a bit of spanish so I can make a phone call to a veterinary clinic in lima to inquire about nembutal and ask if they are willing to sell it to a tourist.

				Jovan, did you have any luck getting onto the Exit forums?&nbsp; I wound up there too, trying to find those same alleged Chinese nembutal sources.&nbsp; I was never able to get on the forums though.

				There are a couple of chinese RC vendors on the road. For a few coins, they might be able to connect you with a source? Out of curiosity, why pentobarbital? I thought that barbiturates were essentially phased out and replaced by benzodiazepines?

				Stop spamming this thread, damnit.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip rustbucket, I will send a few messages.&nbsp; For folks that enjoy sedative/hypnotics, short-acting barbiturates are supposedly more euphoric than benzodiazepines.&nbsp; Also, pentobarbital (nembutal) has the glam/celeb factor going for it, as it was one of the drugs that Marilyn Monroe took regularly and eventually used to take the long sleep.

				If you&#039;re looking for Nembutal to commit suicide with, good luck. Unless you manage to join Exit you&#039;re probably not going to get any reasonable amounts.<br /><br />But, if you&#039;re looking to get it so you can enjoy a euphoric sedative-hypnotic rush, you should give Midazolam a try. It&#039;s the same stuff they give you when you have dental surgery, and it&#039;s water soluble.
