				xpost from rumor mill for the newbies&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t find a review post for this new seller &amp; they deserve one! packaging was above &amp; beyond what&#039;s expected for a few pills, but still blends in with my normal mail.&nbsp; I had a slight issue on my first order because it had been sitting in my 90+ degree mailbox for hours, but did not affect product quality. These would definitely make it through the mail if they were somehow opened along the way.&nbsp; My second order was larger &amp; they included a bonus item. came in about 3 days &amp; they were offering free shipping which was very nice. They even had multiple varieties of roxies &amp; accepted requests for a particular kind if anyone had a preference (I didn&#039;t but I know some people do).<br />I think their official reviews speak for themselves but just wanted to give them some forum love. I bought roxies but they mention they will soon sell adderall as well which sounds good to me.<br /><br />

				Thank you so much for the wonderful review! We are working very hard to take care of our customers &amp; it&#039;s nice to be appreciated. We&#039;ve been so busy that we haven&#039;t had much of a chance to get to the forums but once we get things streamlined we hope to have more time. Then we&#039;ll try to get to the forums more often &amp; get in our minimum postings so we can be a part of the larger community.<br /><br />I see that you have met your 50 post requirement &amp; would be very grateful if you could set us up an official review thread that we could share with our other customers (if that is allowed to be done that way). If you do, please send us a message with the link so we can post it on our page. <br /><br />We&#039;ll have our Roxy listings back up tomorrow (Monday) as well as the some Adderall listings so we hope you&#039;ll be back again soon.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />The Backbone
