				◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br />☆&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to Cimicon&#039;s RX shop.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ☆<br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br />We welcome NEW and/or LOW PURCHASING STAT BUYERS to order from us with the protection of ESCROW. The way the Silk Road experience is meant to be.<br /><br />Our ESCROW policy is simple:<br /><br />◉ For New or Low Purchasing Stat BUYERs, (Buyers with purchasing stats of &lt;=5 total purchases and/or &lt;$300 spent on SR)<br /><br />◾ If your order total is $500 or less (before shipping/handling costs):<br />your order will be held in escrow and you will NOT be asked to FE (finalize early, finalize before shipping).<br /><br />This applies per order. So if you place 2 orders of $500 or less (same day), they will both be held in escrow and will NOT require FE. <br /><br />◾ If your order total is GREATER than $500 (before shipping/handling costs):<br />you *MAY* be asked to finalize before shipping. It all depends on your stats.<br /><br />So, if you have a refund rate is relatively high and/or auto-finalize rate greater than 0%,<br />the more likely we *MAY* ask that your order be finalized before shipping if it&#039;s greater than $500.<br /><br />◾NOTE: If you&#039;re a repeat buyer of ours with low purchasing stats, you will have NO limits and ALL your orders with us, no matter how much they are for, will be held in ESCROW.<br /><br />◾ If you&#039;re not sure if you might have to finalize early, just ask. We&#039;re not so rigid about our policy. It&#039;s more of a guideline than a rule.<br /><br />Or we can check your stats by ordering our FREE Buyer Purchasing Stat Check listing; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/baa3366e26<br />As soon as we check your stats, we&#039;ll cancel the order and your stats with remain unaffected by the cancellation. And we&#039;ll let you know if you can order and at what limit. You may find that we will allow you to order &gt;$500 and remain in escrow. <br /><br />Remember, a vendor cannot see your stats until you place an order. <br /><br />◾ If we discover that you happen to be on SR Vendor&#039;s Private Bad Buyer Blacklist, we reserve the right to exercise one of the following actions:<br />- Limit your transaction to $200 or less in order to be protected by escrow.<br />- Ask that you finalize early (depending on why your buyer name is on the list)<br />- Refuse your order and cancel it (if more than one vendor submitted your buyer name to the list or a particularly bad experience was detailed by a vendor).<br /><br />But we&#039;re pretty flexible and reasonable. So if you have a pretty good explanation, we&#039;ll go with that and give you the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br /><br />◉ For established SR Buyers (Buyers with purchasing stats &gt;5 total purchases and/or &gt;$500 spent on SR)<br /><br />◾ All orders handled in Escrow, period. ;)<br /><br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br />◉ We also do custom orders. Ask us about making you a custom stealth listing for quantities not listed or for combination* orders.<br /><br />We have a minimum 20 pill quantity limit for custom orders and a maximum 1500 to 2000 pill limit for custom orders.<br /><br />*We can also discount shipping for combo orders.<br /><br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br />◉ All orders are shipped with a DCN(tracking number) via USPS Priority Mail.<br />While we can provide you with a DCN, we don&#039;t do so by default and generally don&#039;t like to give it out unless there&#039;s a problem.<br />But if you really need it, send us a message on SR and we can give it to you. We ask that you wait until about 72hours after your order has been marked in transit before requesting one.<br /><br /><br />◉► Link to our Vendor Profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a5b383e53f/0/25<br /><br />Check it out for our latest offerings, current specials, what&#039;s in stock, current policies and for our PGP KEY (which is also on each listing)<br /><br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br /><br />We accept order address submissions in PGP, Privnote or just plain text.<br /><br />◾ PGP Tutorials:<br />-Windows: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br />-Mac:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7753.0<br /><br />◾ Privnote&#039;s webpage: https://privnote.com/<br /><br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br />How to check your current buyer stats:<br /><br />1. Click account on SR page (near top center of the page).<br />2. On the right side, click &quot;Purchasing stats&quot;<br /><br />This is what a vendor can see, but ONLY when you place an order. A vendor can&#039;t see it before that and can&#039;t see it anymore after your order is marked in transit.<br /><br />◍▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬◍<br /><br />Since SR&#039;s feedback algorithm is weird to say the least, if you feel that you might want to leave less than 5/5 for a transaction, please come to us first so we can work out whatever the problem might have been. Leaving a 4/5 down to a 1/5 rating can shave off a pretty big % chunk off a vendor&#039;s rating (thanks to the weird calculation of the feedback rating algorithm).
