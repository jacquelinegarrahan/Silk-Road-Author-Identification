				I&#039;m no computer whiz but I use SR and Tor exclusively on my laptop and by and larger it&#039;s almost as fast as clear net sites. My guess would be you&#039;re laptop itself is just slow or you&#039;re internet is slow, however if it works fine on your desktop I guess thats not it.. Doubt this helps much, just my 2 cents and trying to get to 50

				Thank you fellows. However, through trial and error I have deducted that internet connection is definitely not the issue. The desktop has a slow &#039;Cheap and slow&#039; connection and it works fine, whilst the fast modern stick is in the laptop and I have just spent 2 hours unsuccessfully getting on to SR. <br /><br />ALSO, the laptop has better processor and bigger RAM- I am buggered I tell you.<br /><br />I just want to use the laptop for security, and also use an anonymous modern stick too.
