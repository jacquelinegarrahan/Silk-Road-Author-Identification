				Hey everyone,<br />I just wanted to write a review for a coke vendor. I had the best coke experience of my life this past weekend because of this amazing vendor!<br /><br />During my search for blow on SR I found a lot of different options domestically for the US. At first NOD seemed to be the guy on the top, but, upon researching I decided I was going to pick someone else because a lot of people seemed to think his stuff was over priced. I figured since a lot of vendor&#039;s prices for were close I would choose some other guy. I made the right choice.<br /><br />I stumbled across Dr. White. I loved how he had done melting point tests, purity, and adulterant tests on his cocaine. In the description he stated the cocaine melted at 175F. Tested negative for adulterants and was a 5/5 on purity. I had some questions about his description. He stated that if you were to do too much that it could get on top of you real quick. He said that he recommended taking his etizolam pills to help if you are skiing too hard or want to come down easy and fall asleep fast. <br /><br />I found that he took his time and cared about his customers&#039; experience and also their safety. Anyways, I sent him a message and asked him if he could do a custom listing for me so I could receive a gram of coke and 2 eitzolam pills so my GF and I could fall asleep after a long night. Immediately he responded and created my custom order. I put the money through full escrow and the transaction was initiated. <br /><br />I received my order within 3 days of ship out date. Upon receiving the package I opened it up and the goods were vacuumed sealed which was definitely adequate for this type of delivery. I weighed the coke and it weighed close to a gram and a half! AMAZING! I blew the extra bit and saved 1.0 gram for the Saturday. Let me tell you. This coke was AMAZEBALLS! My friend and I would blow 0.15 between the two of us in 2 lines and that was enough for 45 mins to an hour and a half! It would be too much to do much more than that! <br /><br />Saturday came by and my girlfiend, my buddy, and I started at 4pm and planned to kill that gram by the end of the night. Well, by 11pm we had only done 0.40 of the bag! WTF that lasted a long time. Since we realized that ,even with our veteran coke skills that we have, we were not going to be able to finish this by ourselves. We invited 2 more people over to help us with the 0.60 that was left. Needless to say, at 5am the next morning all of us had just finished the bag. This gram lasted 13 hours! As soon as 530 rolled around My girlfriend and I took one of the etizolam pills as recommended by Dr. White. Even though I was out of my mind from the blow within 25 mins I was asleep. I woke up 6 hours later refreshed and no stuffy nose. <br /><br />I could not have asked for a better experience on coke. It was the best product I had ever done and with the added pills I came down better that I ever had before. If you want the best coke get a hold of Dr White and he will make you feel like you took a time machine back to the 80&#039;s. He is a 5 star vendor with veteran experience on the topic. I will never use another vendor again for this! Apparently, he has a new batch that its melting point is 190F! Remember that movie blow. (I am pretty sure 190F is the best blow you can get) Ya, if that is true it is pure as the driven snow. Not like the last batch was much worst than the best. I will be getting some of his new product and will update this thread with the new review.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time in reading and if anyone has any questions please feel free to message me :)<br />Naomi<br />

				It is fire. Everyone that was with me said they couldn&#039;t believe it and that they couldn&#039;t believe how crappy the stuff that they were doing before. It really showed us how bad we were getting ripped off on the streets. Always wanting more. Never having enough. This stuff we were all saying damn, there is too much for us to do tonight! lol

I had some good experiences with that as well on here. <br />I just really liked the whole entire experience from this vendor. No other vendor puts me at ease like he did. The etizolam pills and service. I looked up the interaction with coke and etizolam and I heard that a lot of overdose patients will get some of that medication to calm them down. So, after I read that I knew that Dr White knew what was really up.
