				Sorry this isn&#039;t in the off-topic section, but I can&#039;t post there.<br /><br />(Clearnet warning) http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2372554/Cannabis-plants-spring-German-town-campaigners-plant-thousands-seeds-protest-demonisation-drug.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Cannabis plants are sprouting up all over a German town after pro-marijuana supporters planted tens of thousands of seeds last month.<br /><br />Supporters of the group A Few Autonomous Flower Children spread several kilograms of seeds around the university town of Gottingen last month.<br /><br />They say they are protesting its &#039;demonisation&#039; in Germany&#039;s &#039;restrictive drug laws&#039;.<br /><br />Scores of the plants have sprouted all over the town this week to the fury of the local police and council.<br /><br />A website shows dozens of photos of the cannabis plants blooming in public parks, allotments, gardens and window boxes all over town - with some even growing outside the local police station.<br /><br />Police have been ripping out the illegal plants on sight but the sheer number of blossoming plants became noticeable in the past week.<br /><br />A police spokesman said 70 plants had been removed so far - including the ones outside the police station - adding: &#039;Everything that looks like cannabis is torn out.&#039;<br />She confirmed that officers were expecting to see a huge rise in the number of cannabis plants in public areas, adding: &#039;Officers have been told to be vigilant and destroy any plants they see.&#039;<br /><br />A spokesman for A Few Autonomous Flower Children said: &#039;We can&#039;t set eyes on this useful and beautiful plant because it&#039;s absolutely forbidden in Germany to grow it.&#039;<br /><br />She added: &#039;This action is a big deal - people (from A Few Autonomous Flower Children) really put effort into it.&#039;<br /><br />Local Marcus Baum said: &#039;The cannabis plants are sprouting up everywhere.<br /><br />&#039;They removed the ones from the police station very quickly, but the plants are coming up in parks and gardens everywhere.<br /><br />&#039;Some are even growing in window boxes.&#039;<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Seed bombs for everyone!!! This could be genious. Spread seeds all over your town, then grow in your back yard. If the fuzz catches you, your defense is that you didn&#039;t plant them and didn&#039;t know what they were.
