				This is not my recipe, all credit goes to the creator. <br />Hopefully spreading the word can assist others as it has for myself. <br /><br />Thomas Detox Recipe <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: I am not a doctor, simply a long-time Rx opiate junkie who has had many opportunities to develop a way to detox. This is a recipe for at-home self-detox from opiates based on my experience as well as that of many other addicts. It is not intended as professional medical advice. It is always wise to make sure none of the recipe ingredients or procedures conflict with medications you may be taking. Likewise, if you have any medical condition, disease, allergy or any other health issue, consult your doctor before using the recipe. Thanks, Thomas <br /><br />This recipe is designed for cold turkey opiate detox. It assumes that you can get about 5 to 7 days away from your job or household responsibilities during which you can sleep, veg and act as miserable as you feel. Opiate WD mimics the symptoms of the common flu, so, if you need a smokescreen, hide behind a bad case of the flu. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t take time off to detox, I recommend you follow a taper regimen using your drug of choice or suitable alternate -- the slower the taper, the better. <br /><br />For the Recipe, You&#039;ll need: <br /><br />1. Valium (or another benzodiazepine such as Klonopin, Librium, Ativan or Xanax). Of these, Valium and Klonopin are best suited for tapering since they come in tablet form. Librium is also an excellent detox benzo, but comes in capsules, making it hard to taper the dose. Ativan or Xanax should only be used if you can&#039;t get one of the others. <br /><br />2. Imodium (immodium) (over the counter, any drug or grocery store). <br /><br />3. L-Tyrosine (500 mg caps) from the health food store &amp; 5http from the health store as an antidepressant/relaxant. <br /><br />4. Strong wide-spectrum mineral supplement with at least 100% RDA of Zinc, Phosphorus, Copper and Magnesium. <br /><br />5. Vitamin B6 caps. <br /><br />6. Access to hot baths or a Jacuzzi (or hot showers if that&#039;s all that&#039;s available). <br /><br />How to use the recipe: <br /><br />Begin your detox with regular doses of Valium (or alternate benzo). Start with a dose high enough to produce sleep. Before you use any benzo, make sure you&#039;re aware of how often it can be safely taken. Different benzos have different dosing schedules. Taper your Valium dosage down after each day. The goal is to get through day 4, after which the worst WD symptoms will subside. You shouldn&#039;t need the Valium after day 4 or 5. <br /><br />During detox, hit the hot bath or Jacuzzi as often as you need to for muscle aches. Don&#039;t underestimate the effectiveness of hot soaks. Spend the entire time, if necessary, in a hot bath. This simple method will alleviate what is for many the worst opiate WD symptom. <br /><br />Use the Imodium (immodium) aggressively to stop the runs. Take as much as you need, as often as you need it. Don&#039;t take it, however, if you don&#039;t need it. <br /><br />At the end of the fourth day, you should be waking up from the Valium and experiencing the beginnings of the opiate WD malaise. Upon rising (empty stomach), take the L-Tyrosine. Try 2000 mgs, and scale up or down, depending on how you feel. You can take up to 4,000 mgs. Take the L-Tyrosine with B6 to help absorption. Wait about one hour before eating breakfast. The L-Tyrosine will give you a surge of physical and mental energy that will help counteract the malaise. You may continue to take it each morning for as long as it helps. If you find it gives you the &quot;coffee jitters,&quot; consider lowering the dosage or discontinuing it altogether. Occasionally, L-Tyrosine can cause the runs. Unlike the runs from opiate WD, however, this effect of L-Tyrosine is mild and normally does not return after the first hour. Lowering the dosage may help. <br /><br />With breakfast, take the mineral supplement. <br /><br />As soon as you can force yourself to, get some mild exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming, etc. This will be hard at first, but will make you feel considerably better. <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: If you have any medical complications, first check with your doctor before detoxing to verify that this regimen is safe for you. .

				Ibogaine is the true &quot;cure&quot; for opiate addiction/withdraw. If your an opiate addict looking for a way out, ibogaine will be a miracle for you. It literally ends your addiction &quot;mental/physical&quot; with one strong dose. It resets your opiate receptors. I&#039;d suggest watching some youtube testimonials about it, do some research, etc. It&#039;s sickening that it&#039;s illegal in the United States but it is. There are a lot of offshore clinics that offer ibogaine treatments yet they can be very expensive. If your stuck in an opiate addiction that you want out of, start looking at ibogaine. It can save your life.
