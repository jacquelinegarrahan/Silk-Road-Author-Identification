				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve known about SR for a while now, but never needed to buy any items of these ::ahem:: types online since I&#039;m pretty well hooked up IRL.&nbsp; Also I can&#039;t imagine knowing something like these items is being shipped to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m totally too paranoid lol.<br /><br />I am here because many years ago some of Timothy Leary&#039;s ashes passed through my hands, and I thought it a good idea to make a backroom deal that allowed me to keep some for myself.&nbsp; Just a small amount, ironically enough to fit into a small vial one would purchase at a headshop for powders. <br /><br />I can definitively prove that I had direct contact with his ashes if there is a serious buyer who has the serious cash this unique item is worth.&nbsp; The right price will get your proof, since I&#039;m pretty sure there is no law where I am that would make what I&#039;m trying to do illegal.&nbsp; I just prefer to keep this quiet and out of my public life.<br /><br />Is SR a good place for a sale like this?&nbsp; Not sure if it is too specific of an item.&nbsp; Also it turns out that many kids these days don&#039;t even know who Timothy Leary was&nbsp; :o.<br /><br />Anyway before the accusations start, I am not trying to sell this right here and now.&nbsp; Before I invest time trying to list it, thought I&#039;d ask the SR community if my item jives or not, and if not maybe someone could point me in the right direction.&nbsp; Also I believe escrow safeguards the buyer and the seller, and since this transaction is legal we can even use a commercial escrow firm.<br /><br />So, what do you guys think?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mr uP.

				now now Zen Garden, let&#039;s not push the boundaries of credibility eh ;)<br /><br />OP - I do actually think you are onto something big here. Maybe DPR could sort us out a special section of the site to deal in drug hero&#039;s ashes even.<br /><br />How much for a whifter of Tim then?
