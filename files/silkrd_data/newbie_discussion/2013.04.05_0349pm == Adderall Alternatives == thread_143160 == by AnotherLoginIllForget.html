				Hey All -- I&#039;ve noticed that Adderall on the road is quite expensive.&nbsp; While I can&#039;t always find it locally, when I do, it&#039;s not that expensive. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s not what this post is about.&nbsp; &nbsp;My question is, does anyone know of any good alternatives on the road?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m talking similar effects, duration, etc.&nbsp; but at a lesser cost. <br /><br />Any ideas?

				There&#039;s amphetamine powder, speed, that&#039;s cheaper than adderall. It&#039;s not as good but good speed is close to adderall, it just doens&#039;t feel as clean and you can&#039;t know the potency before trying it. Also, you have to order it from europe because I don&#039;t think they is any speed made in the US, there&#039;s only meth which isn&#039;t cheap.

				I know this pisses people off to hear, but meth is an acceptable substitute if you stick to oral doses.&nbsp; Speed is kind of always 20-50% caffeine unless you order from one of the big names (CapeCrusader, Maxhavelaar, BoyMaster, and iisthisisi currently I think), and doesn&#039;t always do the job.&nbsp; Meth on the other hand generally always *almost* does the job.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mind the stigma, it&#039;s worth a small order to test if it works well for you or not.<br /><br />(meth is marketed legally as the pharmaceutical desoxyn)

				** DISCLAIMER - EXPERIENCES CAN VARY, please research any mentioned substances and weigh the risks and benefits yourself, this post is from my experiences with a very strong and oft-demonized substance **<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve used literally dozens of amphetamines, substituted amphetamines including beta-ketones (which MDPV belongs to) and other NDRI phenethylamines <br />I&#039;ve used Desoxyn, which is 5mg IR of dextro isomer methamphetamne. I&#039;ve used cocaine, 4-Fluoro amps, 2-Fluoro amps and Ethylphenidate -- an analog to Ritalin<br /><br />MDPV is what I settled on ... but I must stress that you will injure yourself psychologically if you don&#039;t pace yourself with this or other psychostimulants... EAT a protein and fat rich meal (yes, you&#039;ll need to take periodic breaks if you insist on binging) failing that, use Ensure protein drinks. MDPV for me does not cause psychosis UNLESS I forget to drink fluids regularly, and I lose track of time. Remember, these drugs switch off these biological cues and psychosis is your brain pushed over the limit. I&#039;ve dosed through kilos and kilos of MDPV since last may and I love its cheap price. <br /><br />Its bad reputation is unfair and undeserved. But if you decide to try it... take no more than 5mg orally and&nbsp; have a benzo on hand and practice the Leary rule: don&#039;t go to a strange place (set) and don&#039;t dose it if you are already anxious and/or angry about something, such as a fight with a significant other. <br /><br />Please, get a milligram scale. And a weight set to calibrate it. MDPV trumps all other known psychostims (i have yet to try 2-DPMP but REALLY want to!) for me, and if you stick to oral use, and force yourself to consume and rest then MDPV&#039;s only dangers are the unknown longerm effects -- if any -- and unfortunately it will take some time to determine that. Amphetamines are more expensive, but at least their toxicity and metabolites are all well studied. MDPV is a gamble. Good luck<br /><br />I agree also that ORAL meth is pretty damn good. Give it time to come up, it is slow and if you overdo it, you&#039;re gonna feel a lot of unpleasant PNS effects from presumably excess levo isomer meth doing its thing on the peripheral nervous system. Again, get a scale.

				Dexedrine is great, best adderall alternative I&#039;ve come across. Though it&#039;s getting harder to find if you don&#039;t live in the US at the moment. Concerta is also good. I haven&#039;t tried vyvanse so can&#039;t comment on that.<br /><br />Other options are modafinil/armodafinil/ritalin though these usually leave me with a slightly hazey head which is not helpful if you&#039;re trying to study. They are cheap and plentiful though.<br /><br />So yeah, I reckon dexedrine would be your best bet, though I think there&#039;s only one vendor selling outside the US at the moment

				I would have to say that using meth as a way to try and save money is a terrible idea. Adrll really isn&#039;t all the expensive. Invest some time in searching and you will find a source within your price range. Keep in mind getting an adrll script is a relatively easy thing to do as well. Ask around to friends you know that have a script, find out who their doctor is and make an appointment. Millions of people are prescribed adrll, if you try you will get a script.

				That&#039;s gonna taste fucking awful, but yeah, that sounds like a decent way to get a clinical dose.&nbsp; 5-10mg is what you wanna start at; some people have a bizarrely high tolerance to begin with, but that&#039;s pretty rare I think.&nbsp; 5-10mg should be all you need for clinical purposes.

				meth but you have to have some epic willpower to keep doing it without going downhill. I use meth for study/work but after a while it gets to the point where every single time there is this voice in the back of your head &#039;go on, have just a bit more don&#039;t be a bitch you need to get all this stuff done, just have a point... go on its only a point...&#039; etc... its easy to say yes then nothing gets done
