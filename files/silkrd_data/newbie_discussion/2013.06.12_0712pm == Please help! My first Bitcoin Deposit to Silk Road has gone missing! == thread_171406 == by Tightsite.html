				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve just made/sent my first deposit to Silk Road using Multibit Wallet.<br /><br />I followed the deposit instructions on Silk Road and sent to the link supplied to copy and paste.&nbsp; It said on Multicoin that it was sent but my account on Silk Road is still at 0.00 with no change.<br /><br />Please can anyone know where my Bitcoin might have gone???<br /><br />Is there a delay of some kind for transactions to the site?<br /><br />Thanks

				It&#039;ll be fine, IF you copied exactly your SR deposit address. It does seem to take several hours. I believe that has to do with the # of blockchain verifications required, i.e. making sure that the majority of servers agree with the transaction.<br /><br />Spend this time getting what you want loaded into your cart, and make up your order message, practice encrypting it, etc.,&nbsp; then when the BTC arrive you can use it right away.

				Every transaction must clear a set number of confirmations before the funds are confirmed, and show up in your account balance for that BTC address.<br /><br />What you do is visit: blockchain.info (copy and paste that url)<br /><br />Then search for YOUR btc address(that you sent the funds to), and you should see the pending transaction and the number of confirmations the trans has. :P<br /><br />No worries!
