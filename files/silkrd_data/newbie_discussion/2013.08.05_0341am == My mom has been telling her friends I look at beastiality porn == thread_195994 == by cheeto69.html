				Today my friend told me that he had been told by his mom that she had caught me looking at beastiality porn. My friend inquired further and found out that my mom had told my friend&#039;s mom this when they were drunk and with a bunch of other friends.<br /><br />This would be one thing if I had a serious beastiality porn problem... but I don&#039;t. I haven&#039;t, ever. I&#039;ve seen glimpses of horsedicks on reddit.com/r/wtf but that&#039;s about it. I have no idea where she got this from, and even worse I have no idea why she would be telling her friends about&nbsp; it. Especially to the mother of one of my best friends. Like, does that seem normal to you? If your mom told your best friend&#039;s mom that she caught you looking at beastiality porn, does that seem like something that would ever fit into daily conversation?<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna ask my mom about it later, but for now I&#039;m a bit pissed because while my friend just found it funny as opposed to making fun of me for watching beastiality porn, my mom still went and told a bunch of people that I watch beastiality porn. Which isn&#039;t true. Other than this my family is entirely normal, and my parents think fairly highly of me. I&#039;m also not sure why I&#039;m posting this here. I just need to post it somewhere.<br /><br />...thoughts?

				No I wouldn&#039;t say that&#039;s normal. Even if you did get caught looking at beast porn, your own mother released really private/embarrassing/sexual information about you to people you&#039;re friends with. That&#039;s fucked up, even if she was drunk. If I were you, I&#039;d be pretty hurt if anything, although I have a pretty good relationship with my mother. I&#039;d say she owes you an apology at the very least, and if she&#039;s actually normal and not some crazy bitch she should also try and correct what she blabbed.<br /><br />Anyways, good luck. Don&#039;t get caught again!<br />

				First things first at end of internet section clear history and remember to clear google/whatever search history too that is often overlooked <br /><br />Second id say your mate likes it too seeing as they laughed instead of finding you weird etc<br /><br />Third i agree you are owed an apology she should have talked to you about your &quot;problems&quot; not some one who is the mother of your mate

				Thank you for the insight guys. I haven&#039;t talked to my mother yet but I&#039;ll report back when I do.<br /><br />As for my internet history, Incognito mode is always used for any planned NSFW activity, and TOR is always used for anything incriminating. But again, I don&#039;t look at beastiality porn, so that shouldn&#039;t really matter in this case.
