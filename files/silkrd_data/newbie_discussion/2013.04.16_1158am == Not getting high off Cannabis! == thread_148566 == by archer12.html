				Lol 10 over 2 months? That&#039;s your problem man, you&#039;re not smoking enough weed in a single time to feel the full effects.<br />Spliffs don&#039;t get you that ripped anyways.

				2 or 3 tokes of decent weed should be getting you well on your way...the more often you smoke the less high you will be able to get and tolerance goes down as you cut down...oviously this isn&#039;t your problem though...&nbsp; <br />@ papydoll:&nbsp; I got really really really high my first time.&nbsp; That was a few months after I moved to BC.&nbsp; I was ab 15yo.&nbsp; Now I smoke ab 1g/day; any more than that and I usually start developing higher tolerance.&nbsp; I like smoking small amounts often...

				Get some BHO and start dabbing. It will get you real high! only problem is eventually you wont get super high from that anymore and you will have trouble like now. Just on a larger scale.

				Sounds like you have burnt in this deal my man&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; If the weed was any good you would have felt it in your first spliff&nbsp; 8) Stop trying to convince yourself it&#039;s OK and move on, looks like you need to report this vendor and maybe find out if other buyer&#039;s have been scammed.

				I have seen/heard this happen to a very few people who are new to weed smoking.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why, maybe you aren&#039;t accustomed to getting high and it will take a while for you to identify and enjoy the effects?<br /><br />What kind of weed are you smoking? If it&#039;s supposed to be primo skunk, you&#039;ve probably been burned. If it&#039;s regular weed then maybe not. Try smoking a bowl, or a bong to be sure :)<br /><br />Do&nbsp; you have a mate who you can share with to gain some perspective?<br /><br />

				You may not be smoking that top notch, high quality bud.&nbsp; If it has seeds, a ton of stems, and it isn&#039;t bud.... well my friend that may be your problem.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good quality bud, no seeds, lots of resin, exotic colors (bright orange, dark purple, etc.) and you&#039;re fully inhaling into your lungs and still NOT getting anything.... well my friend I shall nickname you superman.&nbsp;

You sound as if you got some bunk. You may not be holding it very long either. Having said all this. I have smoked for over 20 years. Just yesterday I found out I was doing it wrong. Vaporizors are the way too go from what I have read. I made one out of a light bulb last night to just test out on my next purchase from LionwareTrading (phenomenal vendor of fine cannabis). I have read that does not only work more effectively, it also saves you on pot. I got through about an 1/8 a week of $70 an 1/8 bud. With the vap, I should get about 2 weeks possibly 3. It&#039;s cleaner and you are not burning your flower/oils. It leaves no pot odor either(incase you are worried about cheeching up a place). I also purchased a vap pen that should be with me in about a week. I read it also makes it taste amazing. <br /><br />Anything that is going to save me 140 bucksusd a month and I can enjoy the same product. I am in to

I never really get light headed from pot (smoking for 20 years), not even from the top shelf you can get on the road. My gf gets like that, she does it maybe once a year if the mood is right. Depending on the strain. I might get energy and chatty (dominant indica strains), or I get heavy headed (sativa dominant strains). Having said all this, everyone&#039;s body reacts differently too everything. It may not just be your thang.
