				Alright this is addressed primarily to veterans out there skilled in composing compounds and dealing.&nbsp; back in 1974 I was given something I was told was &quot;Chocolate Mescaline&quot; or Mesc. it was a dark brown chocolate color dot sized pill<br />it was the first hallucinogen I ever tried at age 14. does anyone recall this stuff from back then? this stuff was absolutely the bomb!&nbsp; &nbsp;the euphoria and body high was something like Mdma but the funniest thing about it was that it would make you smile and laugh for hours! then the visuals would kick in, with very strong tracers along with exceptionally bright colors and patterns would start. the patterns were awesome. one time on a clear day I saw it raining from the sky sparkling silver snow flakes!&nbsp; the sky was full of it everywhere.&nbsp; so I always thought this chocolate Mesc was real Mescaline, but then others were saying it was LSD microdot, because it was in a dot size pill , a bit larger than microdot though. I&#039;m confused and really don&#039;t know what this stuff was, I&#039;m on a quest to find out now and determine what it was. I think Ive got it narrowed down to being either DOM/STP&nbsp; or perhaps 2-CD or another of the&nbsp; &nbsp;2Cs&nbsp; &nbsp;whatever it was&nbsp; it was not ordinary microdot lsd,&nbsp; I did plenty of microdot then also, the chocolate Mesc was much differernt.&nbsp; for one thing its hallmark was that it would make you extremely happy a lot like Mdma and feel and incredible peace and it would last like 10 hours.it would also make you hornier than fuck!<br />Does anyone here, from that era remember Chocolate Mescaline?&nbsp; do you know what it was made of for a certainty?&nbsp;

				2 C series probably did not exist outside of laboratories. If it was a DO- it would have been a very long trip.

I did from 1974<br />was very similar to both, but still different, because it would make me laugh and laugh the first few hours of the trip just like many say 2C-I does,&nbsp; so now I got my eyes on 2C-I&nbsp; &nbsp; there&#039;s a strong possibility it was that,&nbsp; but I must now try<br />2C-I and see , also will being trying Dom soon also these are my first two most considered suspects.
