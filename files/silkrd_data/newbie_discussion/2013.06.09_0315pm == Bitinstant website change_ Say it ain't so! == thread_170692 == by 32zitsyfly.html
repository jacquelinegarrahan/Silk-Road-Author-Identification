				I went on Bitinstant today to purchase bitcoins and the option of selecting cash as a form of payment is GONE!<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this in the past 36 hours?<br /><br />Pleas let me know.<br />Lastly,<br />If BitInstant does no longer allow you to buy bitcoins, does anyone have recommendations on other sites where you can do the same thing?<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated,<br />Thanks!

				localbitcoins.com<br /><br />But that&#039;s only if you&#039;re lucky enough to have someone who is actually local. Otherwise I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m in the same boat as you unfortunately.

				Cash transactions are down for the weekend. Wait one more day, it will return to the site. Look at the bottom of the main page, it states that cash transactions are down for the weekend. <br />An alternative method for getting bitcoins is using localbitcoins.com

				On Friday I made a transaction with BitInstant and noticed while tracking the transaction it had been cancelled and ALSO noticed the bottom of the page that now said cash deposits were down for the weekend. I went to the BitInstant support site, filled out a request and within 10 mins I had a reply from &quot;Alyssa&quot; saying my funds were completely safe and she had personally done a manual transaction. Within 2 hrs they were in my SR wallet, WHEW! Was afraid my money would be in &quot;limbo&quot; all weekend...although seeing as how I lost about 20 bucks last night maybe I should have waited.

				They are probably just doing some maintenance. I know they&#039;ve been getting a lot of flack recently for &quot;lost&quot; or slow orders. Hopefully when it comes back it&#039;ll be a more reliable system (yes, my orders was one of the few that got delayed unfortunately).

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

				I went to that site and it says you have to create an account? <br />And also, I saw no where on there a spot where could enter in your wallet address<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind, would you be able to give me a little more information on those two things?<br /><br />Thanks in advance
