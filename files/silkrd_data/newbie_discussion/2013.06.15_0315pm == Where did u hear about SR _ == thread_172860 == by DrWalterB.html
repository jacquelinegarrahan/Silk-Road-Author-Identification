				&nbsp;:) to celebrate my 50 post mark lets find out where u heard about SR.<br /><br />Me and a colleague read an article about it in a newspaper ! it described all the &quot;good&quot; stuff that was available so I just had to give it a try (without hesitation). My colleague was more skeptical and hasn&#039;t even dared make an account ;) to afraid to get busted :P<br />I am hoping he will be the jealous one when my first batch of goodies arrive without problems, so I am hopin the vendors I chose for round 1 of my SR experience come through.

				On dozens of mainstream websites, when SR became suddenly widely known.<br />I thought &quot;wow! finally a good excuse to actually learn about tor and use it, instead of just reading about it.&quot;<br />Glad I did! Breaking taboos and rules (carefully and thoughtfully) has been a positive experience for me most of the times! Free your head, feed your head! I more and more see things from a different angle, and see more and more things that are wrong with this system. We&#039;re all raised in a matrix-like fabricated reality, based on exploitation of human psychology (greed, vanity etc.). The system [TM] is pure (evil) genius! It can&#039;t be easily defeated, because its power is based on the nature of the dumb masses. As long as the dumb masses don&#039;t smarten up, the system will continue to work just fine for those who run it. But I digress, sorry! Blame the drugs ;-)

				I think it was from a conversation on Reddit about the &quot;deep dark web.&quot;&nbsp; I will be honest and say that I wasn&#039;t downloading Tor that second and going for a dive (once seen you can&#039;t unsee). However... <br /><br />Let me tell you how awesome it was when the front page of SR finished loading and it was like.. oh, I don&#039;t know... walking into a candy store that couldn&#039;t possibly be for real :)

I hate doing that while they are soo skeptical about the whole thing.&nbsp; It makes me not want to help them out. They call me stupid for trusting the whole process.

				A couple of years ago or so, when being anonymous online suddenly became a priority, I found TOR and used it mainly for the TorMail and to browse anonymously.&nbsp; I ran into the SR, reddit, many other sites I thought it was good there was a place on the internet where people could be relatively free, but until very recently, there was nothing that I wanted/needed in onionland that I couldn&#039;t access locally.<br /><br />Only in the past couple of weeks an issue has come up where I am in need of something that I do not have connections to obtain in the physical world, so I came here..&nbsp; &nbsp;did some serious research on the various vendors, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;found exactly what I need..&nbsp; only to find that I probably won&#039;t be able to order it right away because I&#039;ve never bothered in the past to sign up for any forums, .onion sites, or make any purchases.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no rep that anyone here knows of.<br /><br />Ahhhh...&nbsp; &nbsp;what a long answer.. lol..&nbsp; oh well..&nbsp; guess at least it will count for a forum post....&nbsp; ;)

				It was a long time ago on, I think maybe Wired.com?&nbsp; Don&#039;t think it was Gawker.

				I heard about it here and there on legalhighguides while looking for MXE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then again from a buddy of mine and my love&#039;s ex lol.<br /><br />I learned how to crypto-everything and it was all brilliant.&nbsp; Every transaction but one has been perfect ^.^<br /><br />And I&#039;ve been here long enough that I finally feel ready to start vending.&nbsp; I&#039;m so proud of being part of this crew :D
