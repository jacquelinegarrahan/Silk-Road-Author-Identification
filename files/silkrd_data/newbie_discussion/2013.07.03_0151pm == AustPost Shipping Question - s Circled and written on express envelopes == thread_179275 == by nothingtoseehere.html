				Are you sure it hasn&#039;t been written by the vendor?? Other than that, there is no reason why Aust. Post would write and circle an &quot;S&quot; on an Express Envelope unless it is an internal thing. I certainly don&#039;t think your address is burned because of this. If they knew the contents of just one envelope, let alone three of them, the Police would have paid you a visit by now.

If you&#039;re still concerned, send yourself an express package and see what happens to that one. It&#039;s probably an internal sorting thing. If they were aware of the contents, they would act on it, especially on three separate occasions. If drugs were found, they certainly wouldn&#039;t allow the package to go through. It would be confiscated at the very least and depending on the type of drug and quantity involved, further action would take place for certain.
