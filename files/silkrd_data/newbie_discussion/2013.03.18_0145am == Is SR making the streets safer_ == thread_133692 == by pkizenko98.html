				i don&#039;t think that there is a difference on the street level, people still buy and steal drugs of highly discussable quality from street vendors.<br />but i think the difference is for us, people who buy, and sometimes sell, on SR. from the substances we buy which are, most of the time, of higher quality, to the delivery methods used, all of this keeps us from the street market and the &#039;&#039;dangers&#039;&#039; it represents.

				It has to improve safety of robberies and scams but it also improves safety from LE by a ridiculous amount.<br /><br />So its a two-fold increase in safety, and there are probably a lot more factors we aren&#039;t even thinking about haha.

				Great topic! I would agree with much of what was said here. The guy who is out there robbing people in the street isn&#039;t typically the type that would fare well in this venue, but I imagine the short/long con artists have been busy racking their brains for the best ways to exploit this opportunity. Now as far as keeping potential victims off the street, dunno if that would pull the numbers down much as those crimes often go unreported unless someone ends up dead. The amount of drug arrests are unlikely to change much on a street level either, as the game for buyers, sellers and LE in that setting will continue to be driven by instant gratification.

				I doubt it has made one bit of difference to the population as a whole. It has not made a difference for me. I don&#039;t buy drugs off of the street so that is all there is to it. It has made more choices for me and I can back off of the doctors a bit. <br /><br />The dumb ass kids are still selling drugs across the street from my house at the park. I watch them and think of robbing them every now and then just because I know they have little recourse. But not really worth the drama. <br /><br />Every now and then my wife calls the cops on them as the neighborhood is supposed to be clear of this shit and the park playground should be for kids. I go do a walk through afterwards to see if there is a tossed stash but all I have ever found and destroyed are crack pipes.<br /><br />I wish all drugs were sold responsibly on the internet, or that they were just fucking legalized.&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife doesn&#039;t care that they are selling drugs, it is the bullshit that comes along with it she wants out of here. The cops rarely even get out of their cars. They are pretty lazy here and for that I am grateful.

				1/7billion rounds to zero.<br /><br />everybody on sr/7billion rounds to zero.<br /><br />Statistically speaking of course. When speaking about safer streets you are speaking statistically.<br /><br />I will admit that this would have been great when I was a teenager and in my early 20&#039;s. I mean it is great now, but back then I would choose to go into some pretty sketchy places to cop dope from sketchy people. Putting god only knows into my veins with no type of review system other than word of mouth for sellers and product.<br /><br />I love that I can buy things I would otherwise write off getting, that there is a forum to discuss vendors and products and that the whole thing is pretty safe as long as I don&#039;t do too much and flop.

				Ill point out that your math is wrong, but as far as my original question was posed you are right.&nbsp; Maybe it hasn&#039;t put a dent in the statistics, but eventually it will.&nbsp; Anonymous&nbsp; deals are the future, unless drugs are decriminalized everywhere and I don&#039;t see that happening anytime soon!

				I think it has increased the safety for the savvy buyer/vendor. Harm reduction is a major issue with illicit substances. Most of the overdoes,poisonings etc,could be mitigated with accurate purity and dose standards. Unfortunately, most people in general ,especially dealers are not typically honest.Of course, adulteration or substitution obviously happens on the SR, but most buyers have the necessary testing kits, or can read reviews from people who do. As far as vendors go, If they are staying consistent and clever about their methodology, they will be very safe. I know people who have been mailing green from out west for years. They only problem arises, when someone is under surveillance or they fuck up the concealment process.

				I believe it is a safer venue, than Craigslist....yes craiglist, where I ended after I started out with people I knew, fronting large amounts, then not getting paid the agreed to price, the buyer &quot;friend&quot; always had some excuse as to why he couldn&#039;t pay in full.<br />Next I used a broker, again fronting, again long periods of time to be paid, again shorting me on the final amounts. <br /><br />Finally I used craigslist, made quite alot of cash, BUT always on edge. I did meet at least 10 plus real good folks, few I&#039;ve become friends with, dinner at each other homes, etc.&nbsp; but those were not enough people to purchase product to keep me in business, so I kept running ad&#039;s and then I met some not so nice people.<br />I met idiots that would always show up late, or be short on the agreed price by say 10-15 bucks. Or not even show up after contacting you all day about getting product.&nbsp; PLUS I was robbed by two guys for a large quantity, the only time I was robbed, but once was enough.<br /><br />So to end I&#039;m looking forward to providing people with product and letting people know what they are getting, not claiming my product is always &quot;fire&quot; etc. Sometimes it really is excellent, then other times the strain is only good not great. soooo hopefully people will respond, time will only tell.<br />

When speaking about safer streets you are speaking statistically.<br /><br />I will admit that this would have been great when I was a teenager and in my early 20&#039;s. I mean it is great now, but back then I would choose to go into some pretty sketchy places to cop dope from sketchy people. Putting god only knows into my veins with no type of review system other than word of mouth for sellers and product.<br /><br />I love that I can buy things I would otherwise write off getting, that there is a forum to discuss vendors and products and that the whole thing is pretty safe as long as I don&#039;t do too much and flop.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are theories in math that go beyond that, so that means nothing to me!
