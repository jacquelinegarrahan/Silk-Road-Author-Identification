				If an orders status is marked as &quot;In Transit&quot; does this absolutely mean the package has been shipped, or do some sellers mark in transit once they process the order?&nbsp; An order went to in transit extremely fast, so is that just luck?

				It depends entirely on the seller. For example, if a seller requires you to FE they will have to mark it in transit before you can finalize, which means it will be marked as in transit long before it is actually sent. I would advise you to read the sellers profile to see what is written on there, and also to have patience. If its shipped an hour after you order or two days isn&#039;t too important, unless your an addict ordering your next heroin fix of course.

Some vendors clearly state on their vendor page how long their processing times are, its normally anything from 24 hours to 3 days.<br /><br />Personally I prefer my order to stay as processing until it has actually been shipped otherwise if fucks with my arrival estimate.

				Same as eBay. Seller marks &quot;in transit&quot; to keep you from making changes to the order. Whereas in actual fact, it&#039;s probably still sitting on their coffee table. lol <br /><br />On the other hand though, some sellers might click &quot;in transit&quot; a day AFTER they&#039;ve actually posted it, to give the impression of superfast delivery.<br /><br />I admit over-thinking has been applied here, to a degree. lol <br /><br />Fret ye not though. I&#039;m sure whatever you&#039;ve ordered will turn up.

				no it doesn&#039;t mean shit in reality. 75% of vendors dont mark it as in transit till it is. But I have had people who mark it in transit then wait 3 days to ship it.
