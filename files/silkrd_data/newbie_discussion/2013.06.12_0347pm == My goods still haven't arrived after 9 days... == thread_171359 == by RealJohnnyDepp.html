				I ordered something last Monday and it was put &quot;in transit&quot; that day and was supposed to be for Priority Mail and here it is Wednesday, 9 full days later, and nothing. I messaged the vendor last week and he said be patient...How can Priority Mail take this long tho? <br /><br />

				&nbsp;If it&#039;s international it can take up to 3+ weeks. The vendor is right, be patient. However with priority mail their is a larger chance of the package being seized. Check that note from a postal worker post on the newbie thread. Chances are you&#039;re good, just wait.

				How trusted is the seller? They could be having you on. But if it&#039;s international it&#039;s probably still in the post. If not then yeah it&#039;s likely been caught or wasn&#039;t sent.

				Only thing I can think of is it was sent Priority Mail International or something like that, even tho it wasn&#039;t supposed to be...<br /><br />USPS says 6-10 business days, so business day 10 would be Friday, so I hope I&#039;d get it then, but who knows.&#039;<br /><br />The vendor didn&#039;t say &quot;I should&quot; get it this week, he said &quot;I will&quot;.<br /><br />Seller is semi trusted, read up a lil on him...He likes to send packages from the UK when there marked US to US
