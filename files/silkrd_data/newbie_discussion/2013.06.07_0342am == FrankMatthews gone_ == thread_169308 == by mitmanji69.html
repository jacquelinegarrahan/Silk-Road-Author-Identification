				Sounds like someones life became unmanageable because of a certain addiction....<br /><br />He offered to send me a gram in exchange for one of my lucrative connects that sells 60+ compounds mainly designer drugs but also methylamine and custom synthesis services.<br /><br />Said he would ship it &quot;tomorrow&quot; 3 days ago, something tells me I won&#039;t get anything.

				Is there anymore info regarding this?<br />Is it just a temporary suspension?<br /><br />If I have an order in escrow and he&#039;s communicating with me, should I still go ahead and try to complete the order?<br />or can he not receive bitcoins even from orders that are already in escrow?<br />

The Seller&#039;s Guide is very clear on the particular rule he has broken:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Listing<br /><br />You should absolutely not try to complete any order that he attempts to coerce you into doing. He cannot receive any Bitcoin from any orders as his account has been frozen. Take the issue to resolution when the option becomes available to you and request a 100% refund.<br /><br />Libertas

				To reiterate - no one should ever agree to send funds directly to a vendor in order to bypass escrow.&nbsp;

				I just received 2 orders of H from FrankMatthews. I checked on his profile to order again and he was gone. I see he has been suspended. Which is to bad. I have been dealing with him for 8 months and never had a problem. I will miss him. He did ask for early FE after we dealt with each other for a month or so-but he never screwed me. <br /><br />Is there any chance he can come back to Silk Road?&nbsp; Actually he was one of my favorite vendors.

				Doesn&#039;t Australia have some of the most letter seizures because of intense mail screening thru customs?&nbsp; I had been using him as an H vendor for a few months and never had a problem with him not sending it period. Its too bad he screwed up though, he had reasonable prices. Anyone try Supertrips yet?

				with all the money vendors make you would think they would want to do everything right. unless of course they were busted by lea and are trying to cooperate with them in order to bust some buyers.

				I recently released funds to him for 1 gram and he said it was sent.<br />Speculations on the forum as to whether or not hes complying with law to bust buyers, he said it would be sent rapid but also told me to have a nice weekend...<br />I could just be paranoid but am definitely feeling uncomfortable right now!<br />Any input would be good!!!<br />
