				Hey,<br /><br />As title, just been directed to SR by someone from &#039;Topix&#039; where I was using MOM, but got scammed. So, today I read up on BTC etc and created a wallet on &#039;blockchain.info&#039; which I then deposited some cash into from my bank account using an online transaction to get BTC. I then sent the BTC to SR to make a small purchase. Now I&#039;m reading loads of stuff about anonymous BTC transactions etc and wonder if I did a dumb thing? <br /><br />Cheers

				Everything is ok, see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br />No one could prove that money from your bank account were BOTH:<br />1) sent to your SR wallet<br />2) spent for illegal stuff

				Ya chief you&#039;re totally good.&nbsp; I was paranoid at first but it&#039;s totally anonymous.<br /><br />Just make sure you choose the right vendor for your first vendor to make sure you have a positive experience!<br /><br />

				Phew! Thanks dudes. I went with Mr Cronk, as he seems to have positive reviews. Not quite next day though, as I ordered Monday and it&#039;s still being processed. Boohoo.

You will over time read, read, and read things that will make you paranoid or think you screwed up terminally. Just relax, continue to read and learn and you will change the way you do business here and change your ID multiple times as you realize there is a better way that could have been done. Just never stop reading and learning from the experienced people here. Don&#039;t forget just because it says NEWBIE under their title does not mean they are....Good luck..

				I disagree with what has been said so far... from what you&#039;ve described, your transaction history should be relatively easily traced. The only layer in the entire process severing you from your real identity (your bank account no less) is SR&#039;s tumbler. As far as I know, SR&#039;s tumbling methods/sourcecode is not public, so you just have to trust that it works well.<br /><br />Having said that, one small purchase is not likely to draw any attention and you&#039;re almost assuredly safe. However, I personally would improve your anonymizing efforts in the future. You said your wallet is with blockchain; they offer a great anonymizing service for what I think is a reasonable fee of 1.5%. You can receive anonymously at 1.5% and send anonymously at 1.5% and then it goes to SR&#039;s tumbler, so you&#039;re getting 3 anonymizing services for 3%. You&#039;ll have to decide if that&#039;s something you want to pay, but if you&#039;re using your bank account directly, I think it would be wise. <br /><br />For your current blockchain wallet, if you want to be as safe as possible, I would never use it again (assuming it&#039;s at 0.0 balance). Just generate a new one which has no association to any account or any other wallet, and make your transactions wisely, even if you don&#039;t use the anonymizer.<br /><br />For what you&#039;ve done so far, you&#039;re all good. Welcome to SR. Stay safe.

				Look at the original bitcoin address at blockchain.info and do a taint analysis.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty good at showing if your tied to anything or not.<br />

				didn&#039;t know blockchain had a tumbler.. thats nice. theres also bitcoinfog or other third party tumblers. as for transfering from a blockchain wallet to SR, do everything through tor and the only weak link would be you depositing cash at the bank anonymously (you&#039;re still on camera), and you receiving drugs in your mail box. theres also moneygram etc but thats anon too..
