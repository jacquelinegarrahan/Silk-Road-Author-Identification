				Because I have no idea, people actually buy counterfeits to pay for smaller expenses or something? I can&#039;t imagine trying to deposit a ton of counterfeits at the bank.

				Actually I would recommend you stay far away from BMR. Nothing but children pretending to sell stuff. If your looking for legit fraudster stuff go to HACK BB and, make certain you stay in ESCROW. Everyone there is a professional scammer but, they do have legit warez.

				clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion<br />Be weary. Stay in Escrow. These guys make a living scamming, carding, hacking, etc. They won&#039;t think twice to rip off someone who finalizes early. That being said, you can get REAL warez there. I don&#039;t do that kind of business there but, If I were to be inclined that is where it goes down.
