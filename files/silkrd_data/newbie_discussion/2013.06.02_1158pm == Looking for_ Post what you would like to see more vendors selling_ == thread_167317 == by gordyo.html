				I&#039;ve always wanted to try opium again, but prices here seem kinda whack, but then again its not something I always buy so maybe I&#039;m just unaware.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if there are any Us domestics but that&#039;d be awesome too.&nbsp; Not a really popular drug here in US but that shit had me faded

				how about cocaine that isnt 100+ dollars a gram, or 300+ for an eight ball. My guy here may not have the quality of cocaine that SR has but 180-200 for an eight ball is doable. Also some ecstasy in the US that isnt 15 dollars a pill, cant make any money on that.

				I would love to see more high quality LSD to bump the prices down.<br /><br />I really miss my promethazine with coedine. It might be a good thing I don&#039;t see it on here though. I was drinking that shit too much and it&#039;s not good at all for my liver. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				We need more bulk hash on SR. There have been a few people with oz&#039;s of hash for a good price but it is not consistent.<br /><br />And to those saying we need domestic LSD, we got Orderofthepheonix who sells sheets for 575 shipped and decent prices on smaller orders, and Jackiechan who has decent prices if i recall.

				I&#039;d just like to see a few more specialty items that I only see infrequently.<br /><br />prometh/codeine or hydrocodone syrup<br />opium<br />moonshine<br />absinthe (the old banned stuff)<br />A wider selection of domestic USA hashish. We have bubble hash but only a couple people selling good moroccan or charas.

				HIGH QUALITY METH WITH NO CUT.<br /><br />I know from reading the Meth vendor review in the Rumor Mill forum that I am not alone in this.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are many buyers who will gladly pay more for pure, high quality product.&nbsp; Probably even a lot more.&nbsp; Cut shit sucks.

				Although i would agree with everyone requesting cheaper cocaine, it is easy to find fishscale cocaine in real life and if you work your way up the drug chain well, you can even get a better price than on SR. i get almost rock-hard fishscale cocaine for CA$80/g and it&#039;s the best any of my friends and i ever had, with 1g of this, i could do it every night for a week.<br /><br />What i would like to see more around here is cheap medium quantities of ketamine..! I like to order around 10g (like from Fartbomber&#039;s Discount Shop, HollandOnline (but he&#039;s out of K), UKetalar (just batched again) and Symbiosis). But these last few days a lot of the Ketamine sellers who sell for cheap all went out at the same time...<br />Ketamine sells for $60-$80 for a single gram around here, needless to say i make a lot of &#039;&#039;friends&#039;&#039;.<br /><br />Also, cheaper LSD, it&#039;s a wonderful drug, but there&#039;s not much money to make from it, unless you buy a lot...
