				So quick update:&nbsp; In trying this method and then conducting a taint analysis on both the second paper wallet and the SR address, there is no trace of any of the originating BC addresses.&nbsp; Looks like it worked fine.

				My problem is with the delay in Dwolla (or Coinbase) between committing to buy, transferring money, and getting the coins.&nbsp; Who knows what a bitcoin will be worth in 3 days?

They take longer to transfer btc, when transferring bank to dwola, it can take 5-7 business days. Plus they report transactions over a certain amount. If you do not care about anonymity, speed, or ease of converting to btc, or back to $ than go with dwola. i actually walked away with btc in an account because they did not think my driver license was enough id, they wanted MORE, and i had the account for a few months and when i hit a certain level they wanted more info.....imo fuck dwola. Good Luck

				Assuming you already have a Dwolla balance, the time it takes is fairly minimal.&nbsp; Using BitInstant you can have coins within 15 minutes.&nbsp; And while yes, the linkage of your ID shows that YOU purchased BTC (or at least transacted with a BTC exchange), that is the extent of information on you.&nbsp; If you use a good mixing service, and a couple of intermediate wallets, there&#039;s no trace back to your original account.<br /><br />Tracking of BTC transactions or Dwolla is really an issue when you&#039;re bringing money BACK.&nbsp; The government wants to know where that money came from so they can ensure you&#039;re paying tax on it.&nbsp; When it comes to outflows in BTC (at least to my knowledge), there are no real issues.
