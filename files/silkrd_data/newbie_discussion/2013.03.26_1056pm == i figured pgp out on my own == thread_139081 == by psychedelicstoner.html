				Nice. I tried yesterday and couldn&#039;t find it (didn&#039;t read any guide) so I sent my address without PGP :/ Today I read a tutorial here and found out I had installed it without GPA (it seems it&#039;s not checked by default on the installer?)

				I experienced for myself how hard it is as a digibethic (if you know what I mean) to figure out all the Tor, PGP and Bitcoin stuff.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I have a link to the PGP way of working on my vendor page.<br /><br />I hear ya, bro. It&#039;s quite the quest. Sorry I couldn&#039;t be of help before!<br />Good to hear you figured it out by yourself!<br /><br />Gil

				I truly salute you! PGP is not rocket science and anybody who has the patience and the ability to read and surf the net can figure it out. There are a multitude of guides out there and many vendors are willing to give tips to people who are struggling with the concept.<br /><br />Good job!<br /><br />Benzy

				No problem! I love when vendors take the time to have a FAQ or readme. It saves both parties a lot of time (naturally, if the user takes the time to read them) :)

				It is really easy to use, especially if you&#039;re using the GUI program. The command line stuff can be annoying to newbs though.
