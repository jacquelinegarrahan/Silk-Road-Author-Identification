				&nbsp;Ok- New to SR, spent a week just doing research before placing my first order. Picked sellers with good stats and made each order around 100 USD (not too big, not too small), and sent each seller a courtesy note saying hello and that I was new and wanted to start of on the right foot...blah, blah blah. <br /><br />Three of the four buyers responded and immediately my orders went from processing to &quot;in transit.&quot; One asked for FE, which I did. All three arrived within 3 days. Woo-hoo! I finalized and sang their praises on feedback. Awesome.<br /><br />The fourth seller, however, has done nothing. No response to my first message, which is ok. But then no change from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit.&quot; I sent a follow up message asking if there was a problem with my order and to let me know if they wanted FE or what. No answer. It&#039;s now been a week since I placed the order and nothing has changed. My hundred bucks is tied up in escrow and I would like to just have it back to use with another seller. <br /><br />What are my options?&nbsp; Any advice is welcome. <br /><br />Thanks so much. This hiccup aside, I love being a part of the SR community. It&#039;s the way the world should be!

				If it&#039;s been over 4 days and it still says processing, just cancel it. I&#039;d do it before it goes to &#039;in transit&#039;, because then you&#039;d have to wait to enter resolution later if the product doesn&#039;t arrive.<br /><br />It can&#039;t be the vendor that demanded FE since you can&#039;t finalize until the status goes to in transit.

				Thanks guys. I tried to cancel earlier but it wasn&#039;t and option. I just checked and was able to cancel and go with another seller. <br /><br />Damn, it&#039;s stressful when there is no communication. Glad I didn&#039;t FE! Is there a place on the forum where people can post about sellers they&#039;ve had problems with? I&#039;m really only interested in building good relationships with communication. Luckily there are plenty of good folks to work with&nbsp; :D

				&quot;rumor mill&quot; is your place to go (when you have spammed to 50 posts) but please don&#039;t just open a thread. use the search function to see if that vendor already has a review thread,keeps it easier for us all.<br /><br />cheers

				i think best thing is to only order once contact is made and the seller has agredd to do business. <br />i think that when you cancel and order or get refunded, you dont get the full btc back... at least that&#039;s what i &quot;think&quot; i noticed when i got an order canceled. is this correct?

				Stuff comes up, he may contact you down the line apologizing for not responding, and will probably offer a good deal/hookup.
