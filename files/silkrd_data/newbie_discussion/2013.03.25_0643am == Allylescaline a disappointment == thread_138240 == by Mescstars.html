				Ok I wanted to get this out I read up on Allylescaline or 4-Allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine&nbsp; from Shulgins description in Pikhal Ally sounded inviting and a bit similar to Mescaline, since it&#039;s molecular structure is almost exactly similar to Mescaline, except it substitues one H3C-O with an Allyloxy. so anyway for my first trip I dosed 27 mg. first I want to say that Al is very similar in appearance and texture to real Mescaline a very fine moist powder. one thing I noticed about this powder though was that it was more tan or off white than real Mescaline hcl or sul. is , real Mesc is always a bright clean white.&nbsp; perhaps the clean up process for the Ally wasn&#039;t finished? I don&#039;t know. anyhow so I ingest the Al on my tounge with small sips of water after letting it dissolve.&nbsp; within half and hour I got my first alerts, kinda of a slight Mdma feel to it. within 1 hour colors are definitely brighter and within 2 hours I see flashing and minor tracers. later I started seeing light patterns over the walls and PC&nbsp; monitor. there are also significant CEVs.&nbsp; the visuals were somewhat mescaline like but not entirely. they were different. I did see blue and green colors like auras around other things like lights , screens, letters, walls,and saw some swirling like patterns on things also. these were all pretty cool, but the thing that disappointed me was that the I didn&#039;t feel a mescaline like euphoria, it was like a dirty or tainted Mescaline high, and it felt uncomfortable, I mean the basic gut feeling I had was like I felt toxic. not that i was terribly alarmed, but I felt uneasy with this , I thought what the fuck is &#039;Allyloxy&#039; anyway?&nbsp; so I looked up on it and found that the Allyloxy molecule is used in optics and camera plating and on other refinishing fields or surfaces. this made me think oh shit this is poison! the Allylescaline is poison and this is why I&#039;m feeling toxic and it also gave me a slight dull headache which persisted throughout the whole trip and well into the next day.&nbsp; but aside from this negative effect the visuals on Al were indeed somewhat similar to visuals on Mescaline. I don&#039;t know maybe&nbsp; this is my own reaction to Al. but it seems from what I&#039;ve read many others have had similar effects of headaches from this substance. but possibly I got some unfinished or uncleaned Allylescaline?&nbsp; perhaps it could had been rendered cleaner and purer which would eliminate any toxic feel to it?&nbsp; my advise to any who are thinking of trying out this substance?&nbsp; please be careful of your dose range with it and be aware that it is more toxic than advertized. 8)

				@mescstars, thanks a lot for posting this - I was looking at those listings as well, but decided to hold fire since so little info is a ailable on this RC. Now I am glad I did not get it.<br />Let me know if you want me to post this in main forum with credit to you, of course.

				Although the topic is stale, I&#039;ll wade in here since I need noob karma.<br /><br />It seems you are way over-thinking the experience. Allylescaline is not a poison. It is a chemical cousin to Mescaline. There are two domestic vendors currently selling it and it is normal to be a light-brownish color. (I am not a chemist.)<br /><br />I have tried it and while not particularly compelling, I can verify it&#039;s not toxic at the recommended dose. It did leave me with a bit of a headache, but Shulgin reported the same.

				&quot;Thadeous, are you seeing what I&#039;m seeing? &quot;<br />&quot;You making a fool of yourself. Handle your shit, Fabious, please. &quot;<br />Definitely not poison. It probably was disappointing, since you&#039;d want about 40mg for a light trip, 60-80 for euphoria.<br />Which vendor did you order it from?

				A poor choice of words on my part. I got the allyescaline from chroot and he packs it in 20mg capsules. Two is the standard dose, with 3 or more being recommended for a more intense experience. Since it&#039;s been a very long time since I&#039;ve had any sort of hallucinogen, I went with 2 capsules. I did not experience typical patterns, trails, etc., which I attribute to a long history of SSRI use. However, after I laid down in the dark with headphones, I had the most amazing experience.&nbsp; The music, which I&#039;ve heard a hundred times, sounded new again, and I noticed details I&#039;d never been aware of before. More interestingly, as I listened, fantastical scenes began playing out in my head and as soon as I grasped the gist of what I was seeing, the scene would change, like a different &quot;track&quot;, although the same music continued playing. This went on for hours. I knew the thoughts I was having were flashing by too fast to ever put into words, they did seem revelatory at the time. The only lasting bit of wisdom I was left with was this: Eggbeater Concerto. No idea what it means, but it seemed profound at the time.

				Interesting read.<br /><br />Thanks for reporting on this chemical. I was curious about it myself.<br /><br />Cleaning it sounds interesting. I wonder how one could do that.
