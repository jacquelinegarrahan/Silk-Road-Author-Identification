				Don&#039;t do what I did and buy 4 ids at the cost of about $2000 only to be dicked around for over a month. This ausid sounds shifty to me, I think he has been leaving fake feedback but finally found his perfect vitim, I get a message maybe once every two weeks, I was going to cancel my order but didn&#039;t get to it in time. Face palm!<br /><br />Some scammers are very good at what they do, and silk road is the perfect place for scum like them to thrive.

				Don&#039;t take this the wrong way, and trust me, if your out 2G I feel bad for you, but come on, you really should have known not to dish out 2G on your first purchase. Unless you have money to potentially lose.

				If possible, always try and order small with any new sellers.<br />A small sample order lets you test the sellers product, service and communication without risking a great deal of money.<br />Hope it works out for you in the end :)
