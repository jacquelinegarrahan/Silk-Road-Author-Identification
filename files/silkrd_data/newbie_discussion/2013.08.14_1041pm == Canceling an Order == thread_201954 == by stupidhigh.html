				Well, it is possible to cancel the order after 4 days.<br /><br />Do you mean how long after this 4 day period do you wait?<br /><br />I would personally cancel the order if there has been no contact from the vendor within this period. Or I would look at their current feedback and also check within their forum thread (if they have one) to see if there is anyone else who is experiencing the same situation...<br /><br />It does feel better to be dealing with an operation that can process orders quickly whilst maintaining communication.

				You can cancel after 4 days,&nbsp; as long as the vendor hasn&#039;t marked your order in transit.&nbsp; Vendors are not supposed to do this until the item on it&#039;s way, ie before or after they do a mail run,&nbsp; however this rule is not enforced and some vendors mark your order in transit, then it sits at their place for days before they get around to sending it. I reckon often they dothis because they don&#039;t have stock, but they feel entitled to keep your money tied up with them and stop you from taking it elsewhere.

				As a former vendor, I would mark it &quot;in transit&quot; when packaged and ready to go, then drop it off that night in the box and it would be scanned and shipped out the next day.

I think it&#039;s okay to an extent in certain situations. A vendor I use a lot has very sophisticated packaging and it requires a lot of work to package, and it could take a day or two to get into the postal system; and it&#039;s be very frustrating to find out that a guy canceled a 200$ order because the package didn&#039;t get into the USPS system yet. But vendors that just mark in transit and forget the order for a couple days are very untrustworthy and lazy.
