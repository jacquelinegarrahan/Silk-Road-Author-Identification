				I&#039;m a new user and I&#039;ve been reading the forums continually. There is just such an overwhelming amount of info to take in and it&#039;s hard to locate what you want to know sometimes :) What I&#039;m wondering is peoples opinions/personal experiences on how many times one can ship to a particular address. I have a family PO box I can use, my residential address and maybe one very trusted friends address. I would be probably receiving orders twice a month of average quantities (some for me some for other people ;)) and always be using my name, unless I shipped to my mates place. <br /><br />Note: An order to each address twice a month. Each address already receives a lot of normal mail.<br /><br />Does the PO Box have the same chances as a normal letterbox of success or are they more scrutinised? <br /><br />Thanks for help!

				Its irrelevant. An excessive amount of packages isn&#039;t going to flag you. I order legit packages from Amazon every few days.<br /><br />Also, most vendors will not ship to a PO Box (You really want your drugs stored on government property in a government building and go pick them up yourself?)

				I agree with Discretion - in some ways the numbers are irrelevant. What matters more is whether the pattern fits with your regular mail: if you get plenty of packages (eBay, Amazon, business-related, whatever) to a particular address anyway, a few extra a week won&#039;t be anything unusual. I&#039;d just stick with my home address, and make sure that you&#039;re getting other packages there regularly, too.<br /><br />But what do you mean by &quot;family PO box&quot;? Is your residential address a &quot;family&quot; address too?

				When getting packages sent to home/residential addresses, how difficult is it to claim you had nothing to do with the delivery? <br /><br />I know post is a great idea, I&#039;m just apprehensive about it going straight into my mail box.

				A PO box is fine, a home addy is better, and its fine to use your own, it is imperative that you use real name when ordering. NO FAKE.

				I started out with a PO box just to see how many of the ideas about them were personally true for my particular PO Box. The only truth I could find was that when you use a PO Box, you must make certain that the name or names associated with the Box are one of the names you have your mail addressed to. In other words, no fake names and no fake companies unless you have got those names on the sheet of paper that the Post Office collects when you first sign up for a PO Box. You can always amend this info later but until you do, make sure you&#039;re using a name associated with that box.<br /><br />Other than that, you don&#039;t even have to worry about standing out. I recently left the country for a month and a half. Up until that point I was receiving, in some cases, 3 to 5 packages a day. On non-heavy volume weeks I was averaging 3-5 a week so it was a fair amount of exclusively drug mail coming in. For a month and a half though, no mail. I would have someone check on it once a week just to make sure nothing was getting into the po box. Those bastards started putting trash in my box!<br /><br />So when I came back to the states, I immediately started ordering again, this time with the express intent to order odd amounts to see if any suspicious activity occurred.<br /><br />So far so good man. No one has profiled me. No one harasses me. They simply deliver my mail and I in turn have tracked them down and tipped a few of them that I know handle my stuff directly. They are always super-appreciative of it and marvel that anyone thinks about or regards the people that make the magic happen.<br /><br />There is a gent named PostalWorker (not sure of exact user name but he has posted in the NEWB section and he&#039;s very informative) where he brings up the point that unless your stuff obviously smells, postal employees are not too terribly interested in your mail beyond getting it delivered. We all tend to think of ourselves as the center of the universe and this includes our packages. We wonder or are certain that our package is receiving special scrutiny. We know for certain that this is the time that our package will be handled one too many times and our special contents will spill out all over the poor postal worker&#039;s delicate, soft hands.<br /><br />But fear not fellow traveler and mind-lord, you are safe in the comfort of your God. Rest in his nook and cranny and let your package be. Certainly I am not trying to dismiss your concerns but alas you need not worry about the PO Box side of the equation.

				If no package get stuck you can continue sending to that particular address. But I guess they flag a address if a package get stuck so if 1 does not get threw for example to your address. then lay low and use the other for a couple of months..

				I&#039;ve shipped to a P.O. box multiple times with no problems. However, if you&#039;re not 100% sure about the security of the vendor, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d recommend. it.

				I think I need to invest in a parcel-friendly mail box, so the postman feels inclined to just dump it in haha
