				Why does FE exist? Why is it even allowed for vendors to do that to new customers, whats the point of it other than for vendors to fuck people over? Why not just use escrow? That way everybody is safe.

				I live in Australia, have yet to buy anything off SR and most vendors require that Australians FE for security purposes, which sucks. But it&#039;s fair that it&#039;s the vendors way or the highway I guess..

				From what I can gather Australian customs must be pretty hardcore. It seems they must seize a good % of packages for people to be that worried about it. I hope things never get that bad in the US.

Hope I dont end up in the same boat as you. Are you sure they didnt send it before the account was shut down and how much $ you throw in the pit??

				Bullshit people! You gotta do a bit more research - and stop mentioning what fucking cuntry ur from........PLEASE! <br />No offense, but it&#039;s talking about the country, saying u got orders on the way added with a small population that get Aussies fucked over, and it will soon get to the point where no fucking vendor will send anything without FE.<br />NEVER FE. I&#039;ve been on here for only about 6 months and have ordered to my country 25 successes vs 2 x seizures - pretty fucken good odds really. BUT, then 1 time I FE&#039;d, ( about 12 transactions in ) was the 1 time some asshole, motherfucking scammer fucking scammed me instantly.<br />PM vendors from whom u would like to order - be polite - request a small amount then build once trust is established and Finalize As soon as ur package arrives, and is checked for correct weight and authenticity.<br />Great vendors with superior stealth do exist, can be a fucker to find though.<br />

				you have to search around and find the right vendor never under any circumstance should be you required to FE it even says it in the guides you should never have to do it, if i vendor has asked you to FE because you are a noob message them see if maybe if you start with a smaller amount or whatnot to get a transaction history if they are not willing to work with you many other vendors will i have never had to FE a transaction in over 40 transactions and i wont do it because you are now bypassing the escrow system and have no way to get to resolution especially if the vendor is a crook and took your money, at least if he is a crook and you didnt FE you can go to resolution and solve it there but again FE and entrusting someone will deliver is risky, but if the vendor doesnt come thru you are probably screwed and nothing you can do, i hope you will take that into consideration for the next order and i hope all the noobs to do , dont FE its stupid , even if someone asks me to FE i just tell them to cancel order i will move on to someone else.

				Never finalize early unless you are ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY percent sure.<br /><br />PJ4 has required early finalization every time international - and every time, it hasn&#039;t been a problem.<br /><br />some people will fuck you over. don&#039;t do it if you have ANY skepticism!

				We the addicts are not the most trusted people.Thats why a vendor asks noobs to FE.Now , vendors who stiff people the way you were must ask SR to return their $1500 bond...Maybe SR should give us that information same for vendors who empty their accounts too fast.<br />Anyway mate take it easy and be safe-I believe that sellers who steal from addicts should be punished with extreme prejudice -unfortunately the anonimity that keeps this place safe , helps those fuckers to get away with it.Its the game.
