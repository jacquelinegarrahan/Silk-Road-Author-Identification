				I will start this one off right. Lets get this party started quickly.<br /><br />I was splatted in a cycle accident in Sept. 2000. I was badly broken, all the king&#039;s whores and all the king&#039;s pimps couldn&#039;t put the sandwich together again. A good bit of me stayed smeared all over the road that fateful day. Fast forward to Dec.23rd. My soul brother frankenfucker had made the offer to roll me n the wife that night. He had double stacked blue dolphins, and purple gel tabs of clean LSD. That was the first time I had felt no pain since being turned into road pizza. Yes, I was on a morphine pump for 28days. Still to this day that night remains engraved upon my very heart and soul.<br /><br />The christmas tree was all a sparkle and shimmering brightly, lights twinkling off and on, the scent of the pine teasing with promises of green days to come.<br /><br />I surrendered and found acceptance that night. I came to terms with my new situation, my changed physiology, and I have never looked back. <br /><br />

				Molly is an enemy, and a friend...<br /><br />She no longer treats me like she used to, but boy do we have memories together.&nbsp; I remember the feeling of pure euphoria when I first rolled, listening to music, and feeling every note reverberate through my body like some heavenly aura.&nbsp; The kind of feeling that is almost unexplainable, like being wrapped in a blanket of pure love.&nbsp; Its a one of a kind experience, and its certainly something that gets engraved in one&#039;s psyche.&nbsp; A constant reminder that there is more to life then making money&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />Best advice I could ever give, is to cherish the first few experiences, and make them last as long as possible.&nbsp; You will find often among longtime users that Molly doesn&#039;t last forever, and a-lot of initial high&#039;s are no longer obtainable once you have done it enough times.&nbsp; Your brain can only take so much, and the enormous release of serotonin, along with the residual effects of MDMA buildup (it can take up to 40+ hours to leave your bloodstream), along with heat damage, and under-over-hydration can lead to a drastic change in your mental processes.&nbsp; Less is more with this (as most substances), and that is the key.<br /><br /><br />The first experience is always the best, and the most important part is cherishing that instead of constantly searching for ways to replicate it; that is something I learned the hard way, and a mistake that I would like to prevent others from making.

				I feel that MDMA is a psychedelic, and thus we are to learn something from it.&nbsp; I personally found the message of hope hard to choke down.&nbsp; So much easier to get into that metallic abstract taoist world of LSD, or even experiencing the cycle of betrayal and redemption that so often characterizes my mushroom journeys.&nbsp; But the message of unadulterated love, the knowledge that loneliness is a lie, that all we have to do is accept it and things will be better, is just so hard.&nbsp; Reminds me of course of another story I heard once, which seems to be equally as hard to choke down, but changed the world nonetheless.<br /><br />In our dreams we fly, o my brother.&nbsp; Brother of a different mother, you I like.&nbsp;

				It was amazing. Taught me so many things about myself and made me realize there was more to everything. That everything that I had gone through made me into a strong individual with a lot to live for. Thought we fail to enjoy the little things in life and live too fast. Want to grow up so fast but we have time. Just take it slow and easy and no reason to stress like how we should. There&#039;s more to life than stress and frustrations. When you learn to enjoy, is when you learn to live.<br /><br />hahaha first time and i can totally write more but im 2 lazy. Very therapeutic for me.

				MDMA changed my life. I was a really sheltered and introverted kid back in high school, and would always try my hardest to avoid the temptation of any drug. Towards the end of junior year, I dabbled with DXM and nutmeg, pretty much whatever I could get my hands on, after a long stint with depression and a &quot;fuck-it&quot; attitude. By the time senior year rolled around (no pun intended), my friend had gotten his hands on some ecstasy and I decided to give it a try. I took it during the night of the homecoming dance, and I changed from this shy, antisocial kid into a very energetic and talkative dancing machine. That night, solely through the courage of the MDMA trip, I danced with a girl I had a crush on for a long time and never spoke to. Two months later, we started dating and it turned into a healthy relationship that lasted years into college. I will never forget how MDMA got me over my fears of social anxiety and changed me into the person I am today.

				I was 28 and was at a giant party with my husband at the time, when a friend offered us molly.&nbsp; A bunch of our friends were rolling too and within a couple hours, ten of us were on the floor in our underwear all cuddling and making out.&nbsp; Things only got a little sexual; it felt like we were all just kids having some innocent fun.&nbsp; After that night, I felt closer to all my friends and it seeing them again after that night was not awkward at all.&nbsp; It made me realize the amazing potential this drug had to bring people together and now I enjoy doing it with my boyfriend twice a year.&nbsp; :)

				My first time was with my bf. It was a second year anniversary around a month ago and I almost didn&#039;t get a chance to try it but a very sweet SR member gave me a loan and I was able to get two nintendos. When it first hit me it was so crazy. It tasted like all holy hell, but it hit us fast. The colors became very bright and beautiful and we just shared so many secrets. We solved any grudges we had toward one another, touched, kissed, made love. I made a promise to stop smoking cigs that night and I haven&#039;t broken it once. Have no desire to smoke ever since that night. It&#039;s a powerful beautiful drug, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever even take it at clubs or raves because I feel like it would just lose it&#039;s touch. I can&#039;t wait to roll again around christmas. Until then I take my hiatus happily :]

				Thank you fellow travelers for you willingness to&nbsp; your first MDMA roll. After that first night, when the wife and I were back home, eating breakfast in bed, snuggled up with the warm fuzzy happys, I called frankenfucker, and told him, &quot;We must do this again, and how much do they cost?&quot;<br /><br />That is something I have endeavored to do for other MDMA virgins, if they decide to let me be their very first blowup toy. For a select few I have bought them their first rolls, and had staged the environment for what would be a night they would never forget. That is the true meaning of paying it forward, and PLUR, at least to me.

				I feel like a lot of you guys, that lost the magic for taking too much.<br /><br />My DoC is MDMA, i love it. Last week, i did some preloading with 5-HTP and Vitamin C, and man, it did work, it was like the magic was back. Looks like some of us need to recharge our serotonin levels. Im absolutely sure that it was 5HTP, becaus last month, and the month before it, i did take mdma an ecstasy pills and felt nothing.<br /><br />Make two weeks earlier, a 5HTP loading of 100mg / day. Dont take it the day, just take some 1 or 2G tabs of Vitamin C per hour and roll.<br /><br />The day after start taking 5HTP again, about a week after or more. Yore ready to go ;)

				My first time was during a party after my best friend&#039;s graduation. Some of his (filthy rich) classmates rented a huge house high atop the Santa Cruz mountains. The views were beautiful, you could see about a hundred miles up and down the coast. The night was really windy, which blew all the usual fog aside.<br />I had acquired 10 blue dolphins (this was back in about 2005). I took one, and hung out listening to Tool (who I really enjoyed at the time) with 2 girls, just nonchalant jabbering, waiting for the effect to come. When it did, it felt pretty ridiculous, the rush was very intense and made me pretty uncomfortable. However, I didn&#039;t want to look lame in front of the girls, so I got up and started dancing with them. They relayed that they were starting to come up as well, and one started to make out with me. The intensity of the rushing became even greater, but the intimacy with the girl made me feel so good, my discomfort melted away really quickly. <br />Eventually the other girl left the room, and this girl and I gradually undressed, cuddled, make out. It was the most intense sexual and sensual feeling I felt up to that point in my life. We never got fully naked (her insistence, not mine haha), but just laid together and let them x fueled hormones explode into the great, adolescent ether. After about an hour or so schnuggling, we went out to join the rest of the party, and watched the tracers of the lights of cities down below and the stars above for a few more hours. Conversations flowed easily, and I felt everything was very much right in the universe, as well as the intense physical euphoria.<br />Then, after what seemed like 15 minutes (as mdma really fucks with short term memory, making time seem to flow really quickly), I started to crash, and things got weird. <br />I went out to my car get my guitar, and snapped my key off in the lock of the trunk. My guitar was also missing. I went back into the house and found that my wallet had dropped out of my pants when the girl and I were fooling around (I don&#039;t think she took it, but it doesn&#039;t matter anyway), and the $300 or so I had in it was missing. The point is, that things were starting to go very wrong, and in the very clear-headed state of rolling I was in, I seemed to take the losses to very dark emotional extremes. The most jarring part of the experience, however, was that the girl I had met that night, and honestly thought I was in love with, wanted nothing to do with me once I became upset and started to crash. <br />I usually always do my research on new chemicals before I try them, but hadn&#039;t done so for E, so I was very much unprepared for the emotional attachment (and subsequent rejection) that can come with rolling. The rejection was very harsh at the time.<br />Of course now it is years later, and my story makes for a good anecdote to people wanting to do X for their first time, do your research! And as a general rule, don&#039;t become more intimate with someone that you would comfortably do sober. Or if you do, just know that it is chemical induced and may not be there tomorrow.<br />Overall, I feel very lucky that I was able to experience the gauntlet of effects that E has on me that very first trip. Complete emotional honesty, which can be literally a state of ecstasy, or very dark and sketchy. <br />I have sense done E again about a dozen times, and had mostly wonderful experiences. Thanks for letting me rant.<br />Much love to everyone on the forums!

				First time was at a house party, snorted rails all night, didn&#039;t sleep, stayed up and talked to my homies and had intimate bonding experiences (no homo.) Whenever I do MDMA I further strengthen my bonds with others, which is nice. I&#039;m fairly introverted so it helps me socialize and interact like a regular human being.

				MDMA changed my life. My first time was with a best friend on his couch. The prior months I had been suffering from moderate anxiety. While tripping It was so crystal clear to me that there&#039;s no reason to ever worry about ANYTHING...that thought was seared into my neurons and I was cured of anxiety. This was almost a year ago, I&#039;ve done it about 6 times since then and I feel happier, more social and loving than ever. I would recommend Aidoneus as a vendor, start with half a pill and slowly work your way through the rest. I personally feel that getting slammed into a super heavy MDMA experience isn&#039;t the way to reap the therapeutic benefits, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re going for. The world needs MDMA awareness.

				Since this thread of mine has been revived, and it is an anniversary date, of sorts, I will share a bit more of the PLUR.<br /><br />My wife has social anxiety disorder. She hates being looked at,&nbsp; being watched, observed. The feeling of eyes on her makes her skin crawl. She doesn&#039;t go out to clubs, large social events make her nauseated. She was also squeaky clean n sober before I came onto the scene. I talked her into trying MDMA last year, for her birthday. What she didn&#039;t know was that I was also getting a tattoo that night, to commemorate our relationship. <br /><br />So she gets home from school, picks me up and I tell her we gotta go somewhere, all mysterious n shit. She starts getting annoyed with me, the more I evade her questions about where are we going, what am I up to....She didn&#039;t know this artist, but she had been to the shop like three years ago. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (my wife may have a bit of the freak in her, she might have a coupla piercings and tatts, just mebbe)<br /><br />When we pulled into the lot of the ink shop, she asked me, &quot;what are ya up to?&quot;. I told her to come in, and see. I had already consulted with the artist, had my stencil drawn up, and BOOOOMM!! goes the dynamite when she sees what has been crafted. <br /><br />Tears, hugs, and about 3 hrs later we are at home, and I give her her first 150mg capsule. Then 45 min later I give her another. <br /><br />I opened up a part of my wife that I had never seen before, but always suspected was in there. She let her anxieties fade, her pain and grief at her losses faded, she found peace and acceptance, with a respite from her tormented thought patterns.<br /><br />I try to make sure she gets to roll at the least 1 time every three months. I would prefer it if she could go with me 1 or more times a month, but I want her to finish school more. I firmly assert that the mdma is accelerating her therapeutic processes. As she frees herself from the shackles of her past, those emotional restraints that kept her in bondage, she is embracing who she chooses to be. For that, I am eternally grateful.
