				Been wondering why there isn&#039;t an import hash vendors thread on here, somewhere where all the info on the good and bad sellers can be easily found. When I do a search info is generally hidden away in the cannabis sellers thread and you have to sift through all the weed related posts. <br /><br />This thread isn&#039;t a place for bubble hash or concentrates just the special old school flavours that can only be found in a good piece of import hash. Be it from India, Afghanistan, Morocco or Kashmir or anywhere else where they separate the resin from the plant then post your experiences here.<br /><br />The most important thing is the quality of the hash. Personally I don&#039;t mind 2nd or 3rd quality as long as it&#039;s clean. Mostly though I reach for the good quality shit. If it bubbles I&#039;m into it first. If you have to burn it to get it in a joint it&#039;s not worth it.<br /><br />So, tell me about your most beautiful bubbly Kashmir or your worst engine oil Afghan. I&#039;ll post about my good and bad experiences shortly.

				&nbsp;:o<br />Dont rely on the forums for this, you will get people coming here promoting , which is all good.<br /><br />But you should seek out what the feed back is telling you.

				Dont rely on the forums for what? To write reviews of the hash i&#039;ve smoked and vendors I&#039;ve got it from? You&#039;re right maybe I wont bother, pearls before swine and all that. Shills are unlikely write reviews of more than 1 seller, I&#039;m planning on exposing them all he he he.<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m doing this is precisely because of the poor quality of feedback on SR. Not the feedback system but the people leaving the feedback. Can&#039;t believe the amount of really good feedback reviews I&#039;ve read and bought hash on the bakc of only to find the hash is either average or positively crap (other reason is post count obv).<br /><br />Most people wouldn&#039;t know good hash if it bit them on the ass and it looks to me that a lot of the feedback is people trying to convince themselves the purchase was worth it hence the need for a thread like this for like minded hash smokers where we can actually compare these things and find out what&#039;s worth spending money on.<br /><br />For example you see the phrase &#039;good for the price&#039; a lot. Sometimes this actually does mean good value but other times it means crap but cheap so why complain. Even though we&#039;re buying drugs we shouldn&#039;t be paying for something we don&#039;t want.<br /><br />As far as I&#039;m concerned the whole point of this forum is so people can find out if the drugs being sold are really any good. You&#039;re acting as if nothing on this forum can be trusted. What&#039;s the point then?

				However, I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m not going to bother at least til I get my post count up. Thing is making lame paranoid posts on a drug forum full of 14 year olds isn&#039;t what I want ot be doing. This place is obviously more about obfuscation that revelation. <br /><br />Funny that a hash seller tries to persuade me not to talk about the quality of hash on the road. I&#039;ll think twice (and a 3rd and 4th time) before buying any hash from UK sellers. Spain is the place to buy hash from but not the green jewel (overpriced average quality), head for the spanish crews narco and scurvey, top top sellers with outstanding products at excellent prices. The naturaloils of india are beautiful but not cheap while Gethighswe&#039;s Kaschmir is truly the most astonishingly good smoke I ever had. Another good spanish guy is numberseven, mexican hash grown in morocco is rocket fuel but my last order never arrived :(<br /><br />Anyway, there are some good recommendations. Looks like there&#039;s no point in mentioning the less than stellar sellars as people will think i&#039;m a shill for whpever their enemies are.<br /><br />Finally I have a question. Has anyone tried UKSupplier&#039;s afghan gold seal? Normally i&#039;d avoid uk sellers as I say but this stuff actually looks god unlike most of the afghan sold on the road. Just looking for a report on if it&#039;s clean or not?
