				<br />Drugs are dangerous.<br />Drugs can open your mind.<br /><br />An open mind is a dangeruous thing.<br /><br />The existential stakes are very high.<br />You are gambling with your very existence.<br /><br />LSD is like a Red Pill.<br />Cannabis encourages creativity also.<br /><br />What is the LSD &amp; Cannabis experience like?<br />In my humble opinion, it is different for everyone.<br />I will tell you my personal account.<br /><br />My mind felt like a Perl 5 script.<br />Single-threaded.<br />Unfortunately, I fell into an infinite loop.<br />Not just any infinite loop!<br />A first left recursion!<br />My mind recursed on itself.<br />I might never have made it back.<br />As my life raced before my eyes, I thought of the homeless man on the street.<br />Who is he? What is he feeling? He is talking nonsense.<br />Has he lost his mind?<br />I recalled being homeless myself.<br /><br />I felt fear. My field of vision became vectorized.<br />I recalled being a Perl programmer.<br />For some strange reason, my internal dream() subroutine was written in Perl 5.<br />Not Moose. Perl 5.<br />In my state of fear, I felt the urge to free myself.<br />So I did.<br />I just opened my mind in GNU Emacs, and went right to the dream() subroutine.<br />I hacked, but only for an instant. The code seemed to change so fast, as if it were typing itself.<br />I ran the code.<br /><br />And it fell into an infinite loop!<br />Time vanished. Identity vanished.<br /><br />Fortunately, it was a loop I could edit, while experiencing it.<br />I was alarmed at this realization.<br />The thought of being alarmed was the signal that caused me to die.<br />Fortunately for me, I had remembered to set up a an eval() block, and threw an exception with a string.<br />This story is the output of the block that captured and munged the $@.<br /><br />I vowed that I&#039;d create a new language once I came out of the loop.<br />It would have multiple threads. My consciousness would become multi-threaded again.<br />Then, I would have others to play with.<br />Sometimes, we&#039;d send each other messages, like this one.<br /><br />Please, write back!<br />
