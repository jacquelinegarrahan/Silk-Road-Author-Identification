				Does anyone know the recipe for making xanax blotters?<br /><br />I have a bottle of everclear and some pure alprazolam powder. What sort of concentration should I make, and how much xanax should I put on how much paper?<br /><br />I want to make them look like business cards or something, how many mgs would I be able to get on that size of paper?<br /><br />Any special paper I should use?

				I also have 99% Iso-Propyl Alcohol, would that be better than everclear which is 95% ethanol?<br /><br />I know the IPA is a bit toxic but it is going to completely evaporate right?

				Dissolve alprazolam powder in either ethanol or better yet, propylene glycol. Use a dropper and slowly drop a measured amount over a piece of perforated blotter paper.<br /><br />Isopropyl will work but I am not sure if alprazolam has better solubility in it and it is more toxic.

				I don&#039;t think propylene glycol will ever evaporate will it? Won&#039;t just suck water into the paper?

				There&#039;s a legit vendor selling xanax powder that explains how to to this on his vendor page!!!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t personally done this but hope this helps.... <br /><br />This tells you how to make a liquid solution that can be dropped on anything (blotter, candy, etc..)...If you are wonting to lay the blotters a sheet at a time or more i would suggest looking into the LSD threads because laying any liquid on paper is almost the same process and theirs good information about laying LSD blotters out there....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The vendor that supplied this:&nbsp; &nbsp; pharmacypowder<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vendor page:&nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5f6e4dce75<br /><br />***HOW TO MAKE XANAX INTO A SOLUTION WHICH CAN BE USED TO MAKE XANAX MINTS, CANDIES, BLOTTER AND SO MUCH MORE!***<br /><br />I GET MANY MESSAGES EACH DAY REGARDING HOW TO MAKE THE XANAX POWDER INTO A SOLUTION WHICH CAN BE USED TO ENSURE YOU GET EVEN DOSES AND CAN ALSO BE USED TO MAKE XANAX MINTS, CANDIES, BLOTTERS, AND PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT IS EDIBLE! :) BECAUSE I SPEND SO MUCH TIME ANSWERING QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS I AM GOING TO POST THE TECH BELOW FOR EVERYONE :)<br /><br />&quot;Hello there friends :) Yes I know a method that is very simple to get even doses, there are two ways to this method, one involves very high purity alcohol which is what I have written below OR you can use Propylene glycol in place of the alcohol, if you would like to use Propylene glycol then just do the exact method below but everywhere where it says to use alcohol do not use alcohol and replace it with the Propylene glycol. I actually recommend that you use Propylene glycol as Xanax is more soluble in it so it makes a more potent solution and it is also dirt cheap and very easily available :)<br /><br />You need alcohol that is at a minimum 90% alcohol (the higher the better) but I&#039;m not talking rubbing alcohol, you need to ingest the stuff so what most people use is Everclear as it can be bought at the liquor store and is above 90%. If you want 1MG per one milliliter of liquid than lets say you have 250MG of powder, simply dump that powder into 250millilers of everclear, shake it up before each use and then boom you have 1mg per ML. If you want 2MG per millimeter than just cut the amount of alcohol in half to 125ML and then you have 2MG of pure Xanax for every tiny one ML drop of liquid. Now, there are lots of things you can do with this liquid. Most people just dose it as is, so if they made a 2MG per 1ML solution they would just swallow the tiny 1ML of alcohol, even though it is high strength alcohol it is such a little amount that it won&#039;t effect how you feel or be dangerous in anyway. What others do is drop the desired dose onto candies or mints, or blotter paper. some do this and ingest it right away while others drop onto candies, mints or even gummy bears and then wait for the alcohol to evaporate completely off the candy or whatever was used (Such a tiny amount of high strength alcohol will evaporate very quickly) and then they can actually carry the candies around for later use or sale. Imagine being able to walk around with a shit load of mints/candies/marshmallows or whatever you choose to use that are actually laced with Xanax! If ever stopped by the police, all you have on you is a bag of Candy and if your planning on reselling it who wouldn&#039;t rather buy a candy that has the same effect as a Xanax pill? It helps block out that bitter taste AND protects you from arrest :) Enjoy!&quot;<br />
