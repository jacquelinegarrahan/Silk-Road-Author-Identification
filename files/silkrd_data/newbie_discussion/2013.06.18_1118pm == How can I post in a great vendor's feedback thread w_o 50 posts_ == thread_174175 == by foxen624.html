				I know rules such as this exist for a reason...&nbsp; unfortunately too many people just don&#039;t know how to act.&nbsp; But it does seem as if there should be a way to post about a really positive experience(s) with a vendor... even if you&#039;re a &quot;newbie&quot; to this particular forum...&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, I hate spam myself, and would really prefer not to spam the forum just to get enough posts to write some positive feedback and help someone out who was good to me...&nbsp; &nbsp;*sigh*

				You&#039;ll get there! And the policy makes sense: it helps keep unscrupulous vendors from making additional accounts and posting positive reviews in their own threads.&nbsp; And maybe in the meantime an established poster will quote your review in the feedback thread. :)

				I have a review to post too! I am not a new user but very rarely post on this forum and don&#039;t have enough posts...<br /><br />Just to say Sumbiosis&#039;s mephedrone is definitely the best I&#039;ve had since the UK ban (and that&#039;s coming from someone who did a lot of meph&#039;), good texture, very strong and long effect, no paranoia, was really pleased.<br />Shipping was fast too (2 days to EU!!).<br /><br />Cheers guys
