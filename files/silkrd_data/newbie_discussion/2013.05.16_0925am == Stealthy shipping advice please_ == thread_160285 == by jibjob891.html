				Hi guys - I would&#039;ve preferred to post this on the right board but as a noob it looks like I can only post here for now! I&#039;m just getting started on SR and have made some arrangements for receiving goods - I was hoping some of you could provide some advice/ feedback? Apologies if this has been done before...<br /><br />My understanding is that PO boxes can be seen as a bit dodgy so I&#039;ve found and signed up with a service which is a mail handler working like this:<br />- you make up a unique first address line (they use this to ID my mail), which is then added to their core address - this becomes the full delivery address<br />- I chose a fake business name because I don&#039;t want to include names - is this an issue for SR vendors?<br />- I then provide the mail handler with the forwarding address which is my home one - however I don&#039;t use my name and use a different fake company name. There&#039;s already a company registered at the home address and I hope to have regular deliveries coming to the fake one!<br />- the mail handling company then aggregates mail they receive into a mail bag and forward it to the address they have on file on a weekly/ monthly basis<br /><br />Do any of you have experience of using a similar setup, or advice on how to improve it? It&#039;s not 100% anonymous but the only bit of my info that the handling company has is the forwarding address and I can change that at will. Payment unfortunately had to be done via PayPal so there&#039;s a trail there but I&#039;m not ahead of the game enough to have a false account unfortunately.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to order only from vendors in my country so I guess this will minimize customs interference. Would appreciate any insights/ tips from you - cheers...

				Why not use the real company name? The fake company name is going to be suspicious for a postman, no? <br /><br />I don&#039;t know where you are but it&#039;s better to be not suspicious rather than try to hide yourself in any country with a decent legal system. It&#039;s not illegal to be sent drugs (though it is a little suspicious) but once you&#039;ve gone through all this trouble of mail handlers it gets really suspicious. I wouldn&#039;t want more people handling my orders either. The safest thing you can do is get it sent to a different address where the item won&#039;t be stored so if that address gets searched there&#039;s nothing dodgy there.

				What quantities are you ordering? If small I&#039;d just use your real name and address, don&#039;t let them scare you.

				Virtual office with company name is ALWAYS the best way. Company to company mail is the least scrutinized.

				Be safe, but don&#039;t over-think it. The more complex you make it, the more room for error. Choose an address that you know you can reliably have things delivered (and an address to which you have had things delivered in the past) and, most importantly, keep your order size within reason. While it certainly isn&#039;t out of the realm of possibility, the chances of LE doing a controlled delivery for a personal amount (e.g. an amount that would only last you a couple days) are very low. Most LE departments simply don&#039;t have the resources to go after people for personal amounts, especially when the post office just confiscates small amounts they find (unless of course it&#039;s a repeat offender). Most seizures of personal amounts come from people being pulled over. It always amazed me that people would drive with drugs on their person or in their car knowing they had a warrant or suspended license.<br /><br />My Dad was a LE officer for over 35 years, so I would ride around with him on occasion, so I was privy to some LE tactics and witness to a few arrests that went from simply having a warrant to a full on intent to deliver charge due to having drugs on them. One of the more &quot;facepalm&quot; moments (and the moment I realized I&#039;d never be a cop) was when I was riding around with a state cop. He pulls over a truck for having a tiny crack in the windshield, which leads to him finding out the guy has a warrant for failing to appear for a speeding ticket, which leads to him finding meth and weed in the truck.<br /><br />Ok, I feel like I&#039;ve sufficiently deviated from the OP. Sorry. :)

				Thanks for your responses guys - much appreciated by this n00b! I agree that PO boxes seem to have pros and cons - the handling service I signed up for has a &#039;proper&#039; address and I can send deliveries to any name so long as the address contains my unique line description.<br /><br />SlimeGuy - I thought about this and have been thinking about rotating the &#039;real&#039; name that the mail handler sends on to. I.e. my own, the real company address and the name of a previous occupant who still occasionally gets mail sent. I get your point about increasing complexity/ suspicion but I&#039;m giving the handlers a go - they will just collect up the mail received and send it on in a bag to me. I guess as long as the forwarded bag has a recognisable name (and is internal to my territory - UK) there should be no issues.<br /><br />T-bone - I&#039;m only planning on small personal quantities of product, but hopefully on a regular basis! I will probably experiment with getting some deliveries made to me direct rather than via the mail handlers.<br /><br />Mind blower - thanks! This is what I thought and although the process incurs more delay/ time, I think it might be worth it. Deliveries get sent to company A (false) at my handler&#039;s address then sent on to company B (legit) at my address - I&#039;ll give it a try ;)<br /><br />imoscardotcom - thanks for your input. I agree that making the web of delivery info make life more complicated, but I am keen to make the process as anonymous and risk-free as possible. I take your point that LE involvement is quite unlikely for small amounts.<br /><br />Cheers guys!<br />&nbsp;
