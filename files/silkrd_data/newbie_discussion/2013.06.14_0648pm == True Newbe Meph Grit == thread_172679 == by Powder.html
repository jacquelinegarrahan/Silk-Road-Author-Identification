				Yeah so we can spam to 50 but I don&#039;t care right now. Too busy enjoying this meph. <br /><br />Before I tell you more you should know a bit of background. I used meph pre-ban, but only in a branded product. I know that 4-mmc was only part of the mix in this product and I&#039;m now experimenting to find the best meph available, then I&#039;ll try some combos to see if I can get that feeling again. It was fucking good. I mean, better than the meph I&#039;ve tried on its own. <br /><br />So, I don&#039;t know much about meph ON ITS OWN. Please keep that in mind when you read this. <br /><br />Yeah, so this shit is from Full Escrow UK and I like it. It&#039;s buzzy, chatty and a bit sexy. Their stealth and communication were spot on. The meph isn&#039;t too stinky which from what Ive read suggests quality. When I opened the bag there was a familiar smell which took me right back to before the ban. After a couple of lines, the drip had a surprisingly cool feeling to it, (I don&#039;t know shit about why this should be - anyone know more?) Anyway, overall it was smooth and cool.<br /><br />Then the high: yeah yeah I love this shit! Subtle onset, confident full-on. I&#039;m new to meph on its own, but I&#039;m guessing this is good stuff. So nice one to FE UK. (There was sometimes some jitter which I didn&#039;t used to get... that&#039;s all. Still good shit I reckon.)<br /><br />So there ya go. Now I need to find the magic 2nd ingredient. Whatever it was it made everything far more intense and way sexier. My guess is methylone... any thoughts? <br /><br />Stay safe newbies<br />Powder.
