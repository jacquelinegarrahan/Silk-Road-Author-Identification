				I&#039;m curious as to what people&#039;s opinion is on the risk of getting caught (and successfully prosecuted) by LE when buying from SR versus buying off the street.<br /><br />My thoughts are that as long as the vendor is competent at shipping goods, even the biggest idiot of a buyer would be better off on SR than buying from the street. When I was in my teens, I was pulled over by a LE officer for &quot;failing to signal&quot; (I signaled 2 seconds before turning instead of the legal 3 seconds), luckily I didn&#039;t have any illicit material in my possession. You can get caught for any reason when buying off the street, but it takes some effort to get caught buying off of SR. The other advantage is that you can increase your security while buying off of SR, making SR the clear winner.

				Let&#039;s not mention the fact that many street dealers are unpredictable and pack heat.<br /><br />Nothing like getting into a car (with a bunch of cash) with some sketchball with a gun...

				I think it is much safer with regard to my own personal safety. I don&#039;t trust street dealers, so for me SR is a lot better.<br />As for getting caught under possession, you would have to either order a stupidly large amount or be stupid enough to fall into a trap from the cops.

				Depends on what you buy, and from whom.<br /><br />A ten bag of smack from some greasy scumbag in an alley? Bad times.<br /><br />Half ounce of weed once a week from the same guy in his own home? Stay for a spliff and listen to some tunes? Better times. <br /><br /><br />If you buy illegal drugs, you are at risk of getting caught. End of story.<br /><br />Personally, I find SR to be more convenient for my needs. <br /><br />For me the risk of even getting caught, nevermind prosecuted, is minimal if you use your brain. SR seems pretty secure to me. <br /><br />

				The last time I ever dealt with a street dealer that I didn&#039;t know who he was/where he lived was when I bought $300 worth of &quot;ecstasy&quot;. He tells me his &quot;address&quot;, I call him when I arrive and he says that he&#039;s in the SUV parked on the side of the road and apparently he doesn&#039;t live anywhere near the neighborhood. Wanting to get things done and out of the way, I went ahead with the deal against my better judgement. Luckily he wasn&#039;t LE nor were the pills cut with anything dangerous, but they were definitely nothing more than baking powder and food coloring. People who are both stupid and greedy really get on my nerves sometimes.

				Most drug users will need a low level dealer for whatever they want.&nbsp; Low level because A.&nbsp; You can not network in that type of world.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Low level guys are the ones willing to let you buy a few pills or an 1/8th.<br /><br />The thing is low level guys get caught and can be dumber then hell.&nbsp; Even the guy with 1,000 E pills is small time.<br /><br />Using SR lets you deal with the big dogs, the guys who don\t get caught and who often CARE about what they are putting out. 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s the corner dealer who cuts product. <br /><br />You are now dealing with the sort of guy who really does have that &quot;let that other asshole take the risk&quot; mentality.&nbsp; The same asshole you used to deal with.

				Now I have only just discovered SR and I don&#039;t want to generalize too much, but there is certainly a relatively high barrier for access. I would say that I am well versed with computers, but TOR and PGP encryption is new to me. A lot of the people that I would not want to deal with on the streets, are very unlikely to be on this kind of site for those reasons.

				It really depends on what kind of people you buy on the streets from. SR is really safe. Just have a clean house when it shows up. Other than that ur package may get lost. Thats about it.

				For me its more about convenience than anything else. It&#039;s safer in some aspects, riskier in others. Depends on your situation and what you want.

				The only bit that bothers me about Silkroad is the delays in getting stuff shipped, the fact that a couple things I bought have been dodgy/fake/legal highs and that there&#039;s a very noticable debit from your bank account to a Bitcoin company every time you make a purchase. At least with dealers, it&#039;s cash and it&#039;s not recorded. With silkroad, much as people assure me its hard to track... it&#039;s sortof still there

				Damn, it has been so fucking long since I bought of the Street. And even then it would usually start by hanging out in a Bar and chatting up folks until you find someone you can get into a Drug of choice conversation (this being due to not knowing the area, I used to move around a lot for work) and then when it feels right, the &quot;man, I haven&#039;t had that shit in so fucking long, you don&#039;t know where I could hookup?&quot;. And then if you are lucky, someone knows someone who knows... But the chances of getting ripped off or even setup by a snitch or undercover (though I always seemed to be able to smell the bacon, thus all the chatting) are just plain to high. The downside to my caution has been some pretty long dry spells. <br /><br />So I put Street buying away a very long time ago. Got creative, made my own DMT crystals, grew my own Mushrooms and Poppies, and even made my own Cocaine. Until several years ago I could order Kilos of Coca Powder from Peru for $60/kilo plus about $35 Express shipping, and even with the weak stuff they use for Tea I could get 2 grams/K. Even now it can still be done but is much more expensive and there are more&nbsp; seizures by US Customs, but they don&#039;t even send you a letter for that shit.<br /><br />But after finally deciding to take the plunge with SR I have been like a Kid in a fucking Candy Store!&nbsp; At first getting BTCs was really intimidating and I was quite nervous of ordering from complete strangers but the way DPR et al. have this place setup, it is the safest way to buy illegal Drugs by far!<br /><br />So IMHO buying off of SR while following the guidelines couldn&#039;t be more safe, but you still have to be cautious and smart about it!<br /><br />Mushmold&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
