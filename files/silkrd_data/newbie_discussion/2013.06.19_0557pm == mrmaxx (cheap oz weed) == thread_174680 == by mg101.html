				well i guess this is my first post not the way i was expecting it haha, anyways ive been on sr for about 6months have had many successful transactions on this wonderful road! Ive found myself a bit low on funds latley so when i saw mrmaxx yesterday i jumped at it and placed a few orders with literally all my money, i looked at his wall realised that he required FE thought hmm&nbsp; bit strange for domestic so i searched him in the forums and came here then realised what a mistake i made! i messaged mrmaxx straight away and told him i was unable to FE at this time if he couldn&#039;t use escrow i asked him to kindly cancel my orders. So i wake up today both orders are in transit and he has sent me a well crafted message basicly trying to con me to FE, I KNOW HOW SCAMMERS TALK he is a scammer for sure! so now i have all my money hauled up in escrow :( just fucking great. Any advice would be highly appreciated but please no one buy of this idiot! Sr mods should freeze his coins and ban him

				As a victim of SmoothSailing, I urge others not to FE !!!&nbsp; Being scammed is no fun and undermines the credibility of all the fantastic vendors on SR ...<br />I just hope that Mrmaxx comes thru ...

				Yeah exactly what i was thinking all the good feedback is definatley fake, i sent him a message when i realised and said i was unable to FE but he still marked them in transit and sent me a very well crafted message trying to con me to finalize, every message after that sounded like it was from a 12year old kid pathetic really. yeah karma will get him back haha ;)

				tHIS IS SOME OF HIS FEEDBACK............for $7.70!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />There you go, There is your $7.70 you asked a SR vet of 18months to FE for i hope it was worth ever cent for the 1/5 i am leaving you!<br /><br />DO NOT FE HERE<br /><br />I just finalized on request from the seller for a $7.70 listing to leave feedback TO WARN NOOBS WHO ARE FE&#039;ING (DO NOT FE HERE) Go and FE for a trusted vendor who has recent ongoing good feedback, DO NOT FE for a vendor who came out from no where and asks FE for all transactions.<br /><br />Why cant this guy have $1000&#039;s in escrow? Every other vendor does!<br /><br />Why does all of his pictures look fake like google images? (I would never order from any listing with a fake picture because you just never know what ya gunna get.<br />AGAIN DO NOT FE HERE! All that have U SHOULD KNOW BETTER!<br /><br />Of course if i get my order i will change my feedback but this looks too much like a scam attempt! If this vendor is real he is going the wrong way about earning the trust from customers.<br /><br />Anyways i am 99% sure i have been scammed $7.70 to warn others.<br />If you read this feedback and were going to FE but took my advice and didnt get scammed, Please donate me $1 to the bitcoin address below.<br />
