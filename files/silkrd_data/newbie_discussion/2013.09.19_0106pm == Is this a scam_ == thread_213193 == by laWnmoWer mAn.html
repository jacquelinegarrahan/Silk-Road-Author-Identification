				About an hour ago I received this message in SR:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />We have a security emergency, we have had information from a verified and trusted source that a full scale Ddos joint operation from interpol and american law enforcement is going to be launched against this site address.<br /><br />We are one step ahead<br /><br />We are moving to backup address wsdg3fpquyol5oyv.onion see back up addresses in my forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.0<br /><br />Everything will be moved across within the next few hours, For your security please delete this and any messages you have in your inbox.<br />As things are moved across to the new site they will be erased from this one, please back up any information you think important. This way they can not harvest any info.<br /><br />When we have moved over either Me, Inigo or Libertas will be in constant contact on the forum I will also use my twitter account if necessary.<br />This is not public knowledge yet and cannot be.<br /><br />We urge you to immediately move all your bitcoins through your personal mixing address below for use on the new site as this is more safe and secure, or you are welcome to move them off site until the changeover is complete.<br /><br />Your Mixer Address -<br /><br />Please act as quick as you can as we cannot be responsible for delays<br /><br /><br />The revolution is ours, we fight for freedom.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br /><br />This message has been signed to avoid any hesitation or confusion, my pgp key can be found here if verification is needed http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/dpr_key<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJRhNKWAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olzJgIALn6PMTcxseLGh8E0MikSme9<br />zYE7UH+o8e+Zp55LrPpjg+bvLzRBGN4rw5YGbzDehEHmmyq+y7nthTXg2C0TjCXp<br />Ygkq8ocNijgBVHaKeAIhoEjRrRKFSx+wco7RTBOAXIsSUvBR0VPXEO5+zFnMN9t7<br />lWZ2p7nRxc4qPrW1EwKIDRFvcZ2/bl6/ZFCTcCpRnpb//BPPHtVkbv0n/xdVB8ZW<br />FVy/Uz3mnG6RSsiZP/f1G202Xbia5mHFDoaJkkqln3rtJXNkTAo07Hp4g5hLJ6tP<br />EepDHT6yFfYbIckBU/U5bWjZoHUAuzao9MauGilOGmbddn15AuPVl+voOVYSRBk=<br />=/pQf<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That was the end of the message (I left the mixer address off this in case it is a true message).&nbsp; I&#039;ve only found one other person mention it (here is the other post:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213189.0 ).&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it is a scam so I am posting this as both a warning to others and a question to the community as to whether my speculation that this is a scam is correct.&nbsp; Has anyone else received this?&nbsp; I just checked the link to DPR&#039;s PGP key in the message and it doesn&#039;t match the one the message is signed with.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure this is fake.<br /><br />lmm

				yep, definitely a scam.<br />Check forum for backup addresses. You&#039;ll never receive a message asking you to move to a different URL. <br />

				People are such dicks. Yeah I&#039;m pretty sure if SR was ever shutting down they wouldn&#039;t be sending their users PMs about it asking them to move to another site.

				Doesn&#039;t seem like they even tried to make this look legit. I wonder what they were thinking while they made this...

DPR signs his messages for a reason. Verification is quite easy for anyone with a PGP package.

				I frequently get scam spam in my usual e-mail so seeing it here as well doesn&#039;t really surprise me. They&#039;re always looking for new angles.
