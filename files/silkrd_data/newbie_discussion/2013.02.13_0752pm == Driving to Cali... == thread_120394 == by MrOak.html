				What are my chances of driving to California with a couple thousand dollars and finding someone to sell me a few lbs of weed?&nbsp; I have no connections there (and of course I&#039;m not looking to make them online), but I&#039;m good at meeting new people and most find me to be very naturally trustworthy. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that certain towns are overflowing with weed lately, and obviously the prices would be excellent in comparison to pretty much everywhere else in the US.&nbsp; Where I live, I could turn about 5000$ per pound pretty easily and quickly.&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried about getting robbed, and I consider myself a good enough judge of character to spot an undercover cop.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been dealing for years, so at least that prepares me somewhat.<br /><br />So, what towns would be best?&nbsp; Arcata?&nbsp; Pretty much anywhere in the Emerald Triangle?&nbsp; Even if I don&#039;t find a connect, a week or two in California doesn&#039;t sound too bad anyway, so I&#039;m pretty seriously considering it.

				Most people are going to be wary of selling that much bud to an unknown, I&#039;d try to make some contacts before you head down there so you can at least get a feel for it and give them a heads up that you&#039;re coming their way.
