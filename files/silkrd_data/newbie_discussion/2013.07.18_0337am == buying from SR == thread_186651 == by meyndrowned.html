				Im looking to make my first purchase off of SR of LSD and i read that you should use a friends address not yours, i plan on just using mine, is that risky? I dont think itll be too risky especially with LSD. LSD cant be too hard to mail.&nbsp; ;)

				You should definitely go read the Security forum.&nbsp; I think it is MORE risky to use your friends address, because it is one more person who knows what is up. Plus, you may incriminate someone other than yourself.&nbsp; Also, it may be awkward for the post man to deliver a package for you to somewhere you don&#039;t live...

				If it is a domestic purchase just have a quick read or ask for information from your country specifically as most don&#039;t have domestic customs so you can feel fairly secure ordering to your door :)

				You have a better chance of receiving you product if the name you use regularly gets mail at the address you use. That means if you use a friends address, you should use his/her name or someones that lives there. I had an issue where the mailperson would deliver my home mail to my workplace if the box was too big for the mail slot.&nbsp; Not good.. It was before I&nbsp; started using SR, and they knew I supplemented the measly pain meds my doc gave me with poppy pods. So it wasn&#039;t that big of deal. Some of the things I&#039;ve tried on SR probably wouldn&#039;t be as cool if they were opened by people at work.&nbsp;
