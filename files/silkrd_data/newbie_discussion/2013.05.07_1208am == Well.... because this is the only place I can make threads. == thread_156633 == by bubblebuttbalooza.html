				1. Why is international shipping so common? What reason could I possibly have to believe that ordering things from other countries to the US is in any way safe? I really want to see what&#039;s up with JesusOfRave but I&quot;m afraid of getting it shipped to the USA. Is the whole customs fear overblown?<br /><br /><br />2. What reason is there to believe that the 2c-b on the road is usually 2cb? Isn&#039;t it illegal in almost all places? You&#039;d think that with all the other 2c-x only becoming illegal like a year ago, and 2c-b being illegal for a long time that it would be so common to get another 2cx chemical in it&#039;s place, right?

Anyway, I don&#039;t do international. Did it once by accident and it turned out fine. But that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />The entire 2c series is illegal in the US. Doesn&#039;t matter how many new 2Cs you can come up with, it&#039;s illegal. You can get your 2C tested if you want, i guess. Seems odd to lie about 2Cs. XTC, yeah, that could be a lot of different things. Coke could be cut with stuff. But 2C-B? It&#039;d just be weird.

				I know you may say it&#039;s strange to mis-represent one 2c-x as another. However, 2cb hasn&#039;t been illegal in many many years while the 2cx were just illegalized last year so they would obviously be more popular and easy to obtain amirite? Like people with leftover you know.<br /><br />The bunk police test kits are very very similar results for all the 2c&#039;s.<br /><br /><br />Who knows though, is 2cb legal in other countries?

				LSD is illegal in a lot of places but it doesn&#039;t stop people in those places from making it if demand is high enough and they have the knowledge.&nbsp; As for how difficult it is to synthesize, I have no idea.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure someone can do it and thinks it&#039;s worth the risk.<br /><br />As for your first question, I don&#039;t trust anything from international.&nbsp; Although I agree with you 100%, I want to check out JesusofRave&#039;s stuff real bad :p

				I&#039;ve ordered international several times and it&#039;s turned out fine, but I agree that the sketch factor is much higher.<br /><br />My most recent order hasn&#039;t shown after 20 days and it&#039;s sketching me out. Hoping the vendor just ripped me off (didn&#039;t think I&#039;d ever say that).

				I&#039;m tempted to try the international shipping because I haven&#039;t seen any domestic vendors with mescaline. <br /><br />One reason for people to keep their substances legit is to maintain a reputation. I&#039;m not very familiar with 2-CB, but if there&#039;s a reliable test for it, selling other stuff in its place is probably not worth the risk for vendors with a rep to maintain
