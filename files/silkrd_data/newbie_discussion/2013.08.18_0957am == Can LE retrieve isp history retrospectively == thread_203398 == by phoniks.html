				As in, does someone need to be under investigation already or can their previous history be tracked should they have left any holes in their security?

Glad I don&#039;t live in the US... So all your traffic is being recorded and possibly monitored by the govt. Using tor will hide which sites you visited, but they can still tell that you were using Tor. Plus there was the whole FH fiasco and all the sites that went down afterwards.

				Not to sure being out of the US makes any difference unfortunately . They have a way of circumventing the rules with many willing&nbsp; governments/ countries happy to lend a helping hand . <br /><br />Best to learn about privacy . Buy VPN with coins , use mac changer etc .. Or simply use Tails

				Yes. Between your ISP and government, everything do you without using proper internet privacy has been stored and can be retrieved. Simplest way to protect privacy is using Tails.

I only order personal amounts too, but for people who are buying/selling bulk I&#039;m sure any country would be happy to cooperate with the US.

				Good to know i guess, not that it makes much difference now though! I&#039;ve been pretty good with my security i think. It&#039;s been a big learning process but i haven&#039;t made any orders yet or sent out any dodgey emails. My main concern is just being unlucky enough to have my mail stopped and not be clean enough at home with my security. But then you can do everything right and still at the end of it all you actually have collect in person what you&#039;ve been so careful to conceal!

				I&#039;m glad I use tor now but what about all the weird internet porn the government knows I watch?!?
