				So I live out of state for school, and if I&#039;m ordering from SR is having product shipped to the school&#039;s mail room a good idea? Or is it necessary that I find a private place to ship it to?

				In the UK I know people who buy pills and weed and have them sent to their University mail room. I would personally not do this but they have been doing so for around a year and had no problems.

However, once again I have friends who have done so without incident.<br /><br />Really it just depends how much you are willing to risk it. Seeing as if you sign for something you essentially admit you were expecting the parcel and it is yours.

				It doesnt matter if you sign or not. signing for a package is just &quot;icing on the cake&quot;. You will go down regardless. It could be used for international shipments which must be signed for since the mail room is signing for you.

				You&#039;re buying weed I&#039;m guessing?<br /><br />If theres any smell outside the box, and in 3/4 times I&#039;ve bought cannabis products on the road there was, it would be Very dangerous.

				If something were to come up you have to deal with your Housing and that&#039;s just a huge hassle. Unless your buying something very discrete like LSD, it isn&#039;t a very good idea.

				I know someone who did this without issue intentionally but personally I would just do it domestically given the potential issues with the college. If you avoid any serious legal issues you might still get kicked out.

				Had a very good friend who had quite a few pounds of marijuana sent to them from Cali to a PO box at a private college. They said it was great and actually super safe feeling. Especially added in if they were caught the private campus&#039;s security would not involve law enforcement in the matter, just kick person out whos name was used. Also, as long as everything is correct I see no problem. College kids in virtually every college are always recieving mail, and from all over the country too. I see some vendors say they will not ship to college, but I am confident in my methods enough I would have no problem shipping to a college po box. I do not see what would be worse about them as long as everything is correct. They would obviously be the worst ever to ever use a fake name with...

				If you do go for it, then try to select a vendor who has recently had praise for good stealth and shipping times.<br /><br />It might also be a good idea to order a few books, cd&#039;s etc at around the same time so that you have a number of items being received around the time of expected delivery...<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

I recommend staying domestic.

				I&#039;ve done it a few times successfully. The most recent was the best though, because it was small enough (postcard size envelope) that they put it in my box and I didn&#039;t have to sign for it.
