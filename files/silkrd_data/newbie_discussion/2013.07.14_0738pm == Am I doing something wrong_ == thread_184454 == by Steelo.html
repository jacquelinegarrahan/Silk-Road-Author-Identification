				To the left of the toolbar where you would type in the web address for the site you want to see, (so for example where the SR forums address is now) There is a little world symbol. If I click it, it says your connection to this website is not encrypted. I&#039;m a bit confused as when I&#039;m on the tor homepage after opening the browser the symbol is a padlock and it says my connection is encrypted. Is this the same for anyone else? Or do they all have the padlock symbol on here? Thanks.

				pretty sure that says that because your info is not encrypted to this site. it would be <br />if you were using a vpn or vm. it&#039;s not really neccessary. depends on your situation. some people <br />say its overkill when using tails. if you do a search on vpn should pull up more info than you can <br />read. when you use a vpn you are connecting to another computer wich send your traffic encrypted <br />over the web. any other way and it&#039;s not encrypted.
