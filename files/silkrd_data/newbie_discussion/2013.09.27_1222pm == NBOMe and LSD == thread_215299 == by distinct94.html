				Don&#039;t be such a dick. Selling NBOMe as LSD could kill someone. The human body can handle high doses of LSD, but high doses of NBOMe can kill people. If they are under the illusion that they are taking LSD, they may decide to take more and more, which could prove fatal. Could you live with yourself if that happened?<br /><br />Just be honest about what you are selling and you will still make money.

				I understand you being concerned about people not knowing what the fuck NBOME is, but trust me man NEVER sell something for what it isn&#039;t like ^^^^^^^^^ these guys are right. I just got my first order from Righteous GREAT NBOME vender BTW 10/5, this is how i go about getting my product out there myself. I ask around for who likes acid, and then when i find the people who like the LSD sort of substances i explain to them its NOT LSD because i&#039;m aware of the OD potentials and the fact its a RC, which by the way you should really inform people about because RC&#039;s aren&#039;t very well known. I tell them its 25inbome or &quot;nbaum&quot;, &quot;pandora&quot; telling your customers so much info about it, and then telling them to further research it on erowid really makes you a trustworthy dealer IMO, and experience. I would never recommend more than 1 for first time users, or noobs to psychedelics. I took 2 my first time being the psychonaut i am and WOW A+++++++ trip loved the stuff :) happy tripping man don&#039;t go misinforming people its dangerous.

NEVER NEVER NEVER sell something you haven&#039;t tried first man THATS FUCKED UP. People aren&#039;t your guinea pigs, stand by your product and be a reputable dealer. Could you really live with the fact you killed someone because you misinformed them? I&#039;ve never had the pleasure of trying LSD but someone sold me LSA when i thought i had the good you know? Later to find out that i was derived of the profound LSD experience because of some shitty dealer, but it also made me really sick and for years i never wanted to try acid again. Be smart and think with your heart dood :)

They can differentiate between the two and they will ferret out your scam quickly, and the LSD crowd in here comes out in force and will bury your vendor account faster than you can imagine. After-all, you&#039;re not the first vendor trying this--or even the fiftieth. <br /><br />You may be able to fool some noob at a club, but people in here can tell the difference and acid cheats are really strung up in these parts. Just sell it as nbome, you&#039;ll still kill it in the end.

Share your bread, or youre gonna get fat yo! Stop trying to take shortcuts, it will bite you in the end. Seriously i would rather proudly stand behind my product then have a few extra bucks in my pocket, having scammed all the noobs that know nothing about the stuff. What happens when someone comes along and sells them actual LSD, they&#039;ll probably discontinue going through you since you blatantly lied to them and go through the guy who came through with the ACTUAL product.

				LSD and NBOMEs are different. LSD is orally active, NBOMEs are not. NBOMEs have a distinct taste and LSD is tasteless.<br /><br />Countefeiting is illegal, often under drug statutes. It is also dangerous and unethical.

				It&#039;s apples and oranges.&nbsp; Both fruit but are not the same/both psyches but not the same.<br /><br />1000ug is a typical dose, I&#039;d imagine even 500ug for someone new to psyches.&nbsp; I was introduced to psyches with 25i NBOMe at 1000ug and I had a blast.&nbsp; People dying are the ones who take way too much.&nbsp; Be responsible and stick within recommended dosage and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />NBOME&#039;s are fun and should make a name for themselves.&nbsp; Don&#039;t sell it as LSD.&nbsp; It&#039;s dishonest.

Acid on the other hand does produce bodyloads dependant on the quality of course.Also nbomes have shown to skyrocket people&#039;s blood sugar,so individuals with blood pressure issues have to be wary with this chemical.I personally have taken 3000ugs..amazing experience i must say.but i know my body&#039;s limits..but for most people thats a too high of a dosage. But dont market it as LSD,cos they are uniquely different in their own ways.<br /><br />Stay Safe
