				Hello, I need to get some advice.<br /><br />I did a fair amount of research on vendors, learned how to PGP and found a product I wanted to purchase.<br /><br />So I did my first purchase on the 8th of January. This was with a very reputable vendor..that has great feedback.&nbsp; On the 11th of January the product was listed as in transit.&nbsp; I payed extra for the express shipping option...this was required due to being a new buyer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still dont have the product I ordered.&nbsp; The vendor is decent about returning messages.&nbsp; But it&#039;s always the same thing.&nbsp; You should have it in the next day or two.&nbsp; This has gone on since the 13th or 14th.<br /><br />The order has 8 more days before it auto finalizes.&nbsp; I should be able to use the resolve button tomorrow if I chose to.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The seller keeps telling me to wait for the package.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I hate to have to use the resolve feature it the package is really in the mail.<br /><br />Any suggestions?????&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Where was it sent from? Where is it going to? Is it a domestic order?<br />It&#039;s either still underway or it was intercepted.

				It is a domestic order. <br /><br />Not sure where is was sent from?<br /><br />The seller continues to tell me nothing is wrong.&nbsp; So I think it has something to do with when it was shipped.&nbsp; But I cant get a straight answer...only thing I get back is it should be there soon.&nbsp;

				At this point it would be totally acceptable for you to ask for tracking and also you should put order up in resolution I would say about two days before it autofinalizes if package still hasn&#039;t arrived by then. However be polite on how you carry yourself in the resolution process as coming off as polite can only benefit you in the eyes of both vendor and moderator. Hope your package arrives soon!

				Sometimes is the post office that is taking forever and tracking should verify if that is the case but if this was overnight shipping its weird that it has not arrived as anything I have shipped express arrives in one or two days.

				It has been a strange deal.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought with the express shipping it would come quickly.&nbsp; I will continue to wait and see.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you think its best to use the resolve feature about 2 days before it finalizes?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Sounds strange to me. If I were the seller and it had been over a month, I would send out another<br />package.<br /><br />Good Luck

				You can use resolve to just extend the delivery time further. I had to do that recently because my vendor is so far away, luckily the package came the next day. It should have gotten to you though.... express shipping via usps is very fast.
