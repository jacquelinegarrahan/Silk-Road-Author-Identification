				Hey,<br /><br />I know this is probably the wrong section to post this on, but I&#039;m not allowed to post on other sections!<br /><br />Anyways, since I have not received any orders yet, I&#039;m curious about how the stuff will be delivered, like is it gonna be inside a kid toy or is it gonna be like just sitting there!!<br /><br />I&#039;m asking this because I have US address that re-ships internationally (Express), and when they receive a new package they have to check what it is, so they can label it.<br />So is it safe to ship to them? will they find out what it is? <br /><br />I need it because I live in a remote place that standard shipping takes very long period to arrive.<br /><br />thank you, and I&#039;m sorry because this should be on the Shipping section but I&#039;m not able to post there for some reason.

				Hm that could be tricky if the forwarder is opening the package. Basically you will need to know in advance from the vendor the type of stealth used, which is information usually vendors don&#039;t just give out. Depending on what you order it might just come sealed in an MBB or something similar. Some products yes people will use more advanced stealth like placing inside a commercial product and making it look unopened, etc., but that kind of stealth is not cheap, plus the product weight needs to be close to accurate in case someone checks the weight of the product against what it is supposed to be.

				It depends on the amount being shipped, and the how good your vendor is.<br /><br />Good vendors can get items virtually anywhere without any worry... choose wisely.

				Why just find a vendor that ships international and/or lives in the same country as you then order from them so you dont have to worry? The more hands touch/inspect your package the more likely it will be scrutinized and possibly searched.

				I&#039;m not LE or narc, and I&#039;m not asking how the package will look like exactly, but I need to know if someone else (re-shipper) looked at it, is he going to see just a random product or is he gonna see some weed?<br /><br />I use re-shipping companies because where I live it takes for a package with standard shipping almost a month to arrive here. but the re-shipper will deliver it in (3 to 5) days (express shipping).<br /><br />and there is not a single vendor in my country.
