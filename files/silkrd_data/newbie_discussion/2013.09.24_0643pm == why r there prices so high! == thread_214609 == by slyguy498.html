I would assume they are either not selling that item or they are out of stock.

				It is true that most vendors bristle at a message asking them to get it out quickly... <br /><br />No-one likes being rushed, and most of the time, when we have told customers that we won&#039;t be able to to hit their tight deadlines, they say not to worry about it, they can wait the extra day/s.<br /><br />The longer you give yourself, the less pressure on the exchange, the happier we all are.<br /><br />Good luck with the purchases!<br /><br />jor
