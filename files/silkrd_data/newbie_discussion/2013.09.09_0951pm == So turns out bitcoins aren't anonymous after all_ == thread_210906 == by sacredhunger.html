				Hey noobs and not-so-noobs,<br /><br />So I&#039;m in the UK, totally new to SR, and have not yet bought anything. I&#039;m just doing my due diligence, and trying to get my head around the fact that bitcoins aren&#039;t so anonymous after all (http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/)<br /><br />What I&#039;m interested to hear from you guys is just how careful I need to be. I intend to be a major small timer on here, buying small amounts of weed and maybe a bit of MDMA for personal use now and then. With that in mind, do I need to go through the hassle of buying bitcoins in cash, paying 1-3% commission to 3rd parties like bitcoinfog etc? <br /><br />What I mean is, would I be daft not to? Or should I assume that LE has bigger fish to fry?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; 8)

				Tumblers are a good option, and you can also create some additional online wallets yourself and just transfer the bitcoins around a bit. I would never transfer bitcoins to Silk Road from a wallet that is directly associated with my name (like directly from my MtGox or Bitstamp account), but if you move it around a bit, it will be easy to maintain that you sold your coins or exchanged them for some service.

				Thanks cryngie.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve read a few conflicting comments as to whether blockchain is reliable? The way it anonymises bitcoins is vulnerable to traffic analysis? <br /><br />Either way, do you take the extra precaution of buying with cash or can I buy via a bank transfer (on p2p site) if I use a tumbler?

				If your just doing small purchases, use https://localbitcoins.com to get BTC and buy with cash.<br /><br />The money is paid into your BTC wallet and you then simply tumble (as per cryngie&#039;s comment) then transfer your BTC to SR for purchases. <br /><br />Any withdrawals from SR to your wallet are automatically tumbled.<br /><br />Also, you can have more than one wallet, all with multiple addresses, to flip your coins about ;-)<br /><br />Namaste<br />MACHINE ELVES

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />Forgive me being exceedingly thick, but I must confess to still being a bit confused as to HOW you buy with cash... <br /><br />Do you arrange to walk up to a dude in the street?? And how do they get from the physical world to your digital wallet??

				Whoever to you blockchain is unreliable is a noob go check it out it keeps records of everytransaction and has thousands of btc in it at one dont know how people think the pissy little bitfog is better you have to wait so long because they dont have a high enough volume of coins to tumble them instantly&nbsp; <br /><br />No i buy coins over the net with my cc its quick and easy and pretty much instant ive tried tracing the btc back to my purchase but when i get to blockchain it always goes to someone elses wallet&nbsp; but dont take my work go pay bitfog 1-3% and loose how much more waiting the 24hrs to withdraw them then the multiple withdraws also&nbsp;

				I mean, if you&#039;re buying with cash at a bank or in person where there&#039;s wifi, there&#039;s probably a camera on you.&nbsp; So they can find out you&#039;ve been buying bitcoins.&nbsp; Beyond that is the interesting part.

				Telling someone that you did something, then asking them to find out when you did it, isn&#039;t asking them to prove that you did it. bitcoin accounts get hacked all the time. a simple mistake in a legitimate transfer could send your coins to the wrong destination. many things could happen, and you have no idea what happened to those coins. tumble and deny.
