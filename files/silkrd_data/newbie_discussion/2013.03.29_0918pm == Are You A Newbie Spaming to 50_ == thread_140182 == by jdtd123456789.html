				Hello, <br />&nbsp;I have been on the road for awhile now and hardly ever used the forums, except of course when I first started and was desperate to figure something out. Now &quot;they&quot; have made it so that those under fifty posts can only post in the newbie section. I, of course, hate this as much as everyone else. Like everyone else, I was going to spam until I hit the ever sought after fifty mark so as to up my status to communicate with the big dogs. But have decided not to. Now that I sit down and read what true newbies are going through, Ive realized that my time stuck here in newbie land can be utilized to help those with questions....such as I had a few months ago. So, those who dont give a fuck...spam on. Those that remember being a newbie themselves and the help they received from others in our community....write and respond with something meaningful. For those who have used SR for years and somehow you are stuck here, you dont belong here...spam on. Just a suggestion on how to strengthen our community. Remember we are revolutionaries....grow our army. Newbies, post meaningful questions and ask for guidance. Dont just spam to reach fifty. Learn all you can on your travels down this Road. Peace and blessings to all.......

				Someone taking the time to walk some of us newer users through is HIGHLY appreciated. <br /><br />I just made my first purchase yesterday and it is still being &quot;processed&quot;. I wanted to know what is an acceptable time to wait before sending a pm? I&#039;m sure the guy is busy and I don&#039;t want to immediately bombard him with messages, but I am concerned about my purchase. Maybe it&#039;s just first time jitters. <br /><br />Thanks again for helping out a nub.

				senorsloth,<br />&nbsp;Sometimes vendors are overwhelmed with orders and it may take them 24-48 hours to put your order in transit. A good vendor will not mark your order as in transit until it is actually in transit. Most commonly, a vendor will mark your order in transit within the standard 24-48 hour mark. Read your vendors page carefully, they may only ship on certain days....Mon, Wed, Fri for example. If this is the case and it is Saturday, your package would process until the next shipping day, Mon. All in all, a vendor has 4 days to put your order in transit. If your order is not marked in transit after those 4 days, you may have the option of cancelling your order. At that time, I would think that most vendors would have communicated with you. Hope this helps...
