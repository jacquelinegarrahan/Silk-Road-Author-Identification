				Killers are so expensive, unlike benzos and stuff.<br /><br />But damn, i remember a few months ago someone started to offer 30&#039;s for 17.99US but actual listing on market place never went up and i can&#039;t remember vendor&#039;s name....<br /><br />I think you might be able to buy generic hydros on clearnet and they usually get through.<br /><br />-JOS

				Can somebody pm me a link to a reliable pharmacy for painkillers?<br /><br />In regards to OP I checked out the link. Prices sound WAY to good to be true. Regardless I&#039;m pullin the trigger on those roxi 30&#039;s tomorow once my money goes through. Will update accordingly
