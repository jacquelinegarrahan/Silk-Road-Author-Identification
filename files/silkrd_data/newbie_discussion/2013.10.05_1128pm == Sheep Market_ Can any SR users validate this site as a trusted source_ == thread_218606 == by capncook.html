				sheep looks like a candy store, like seriously would doubt its safety based on the look and name alone... <br /><br />...but some of the lovely vendors from SR I knew have moved there, so maybe after some time... when I think it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot;, I try and order something. of course, when I think it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; means pigs at my door the day after. :)<br />

Long as vendors, and customers alike protect themselves, and be safe, you&#039;re going to have to co exist with LE being on these sites, and plotting on how to take them down. Like alot of vendors, and buyers say, the show must go on, but I respect anybody who is concern for their safety, and worry, and is waiting for something better, long as we use encryption on our messages, I think people will be alright, but to expect 100% guarantee that these sites are protected nobody knows, but I can only hope that the people running it are doing what they are suppose to do in keeping everybody anonymous.

				You shouldn&#039;t trust any site, and you shouldn&#039;t trust anyone. Even SR. We trusted SR because of the escrow system and it&#039;s preventative measures against being scammed as well as the degree of security provided.<br /><br />Never assume someone is going to make it easier for you. Security is your utmost concern. Assume anyone can be LE, myself included. Never buy anything out of escrow, never communicate anything sensitive or revealing without PGP/GPG. <br /><br />Something just feels off about Sheep. BMR has at least been around longer. I&#039;d stick to trusted vendors from SR now marketing on BMR. And even trusted vendors no matter how long I&#039;ve worked with will never get paid out of escrow.

It is from some clearnet clone of the site that has nothing to do with the Tor service. Sheep has been great so far. Since BMR staff appear to have ratted out one of their vendors to the press (causing a vendor to be charged with additional crimes) I don&#039;t see another alternative.<br /><br />&quot;Multiple Black Market Reloaded sources, including staff, said that Grass4Cash is the same man behind the demonfifa account, which dealt in an entirely different criminal spectrum: stolen credit cards, stolen identities, hacked Paypal accounts, fake IDs, marijuana, mushrooms, and silver bullion. In the last year, demonfifa has made almost 1,000 of these types of sales; at the time of Bunger’s arrest, the account was making about 100 total sales per month.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.dailydot.com/crime/dark-web-black-market-reloaded-adam-bunger-gun-sales-arrest/ <br />

				I am planning on using Sheep Market in the near future. So long as you use a trusted seller from SR and verify them and encrypt you address you should be OK.
