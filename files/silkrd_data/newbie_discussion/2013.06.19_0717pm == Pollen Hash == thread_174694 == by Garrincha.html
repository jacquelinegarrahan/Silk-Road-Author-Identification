				Hi there to all fellow members of this most excellent community!!!<br />Decided to get myself some pollen, as i&#039;d never tried it before. My question is, how do you differentiate between pollen, and standard soapbar hash. The stuff I received smokes ok, but looks pretty similar to soapbar, and you have to heat it before crumbling. I&#039;d heard that with pollen, you don&#039;t need to apply heat, it should just crumble at room temperature. Could someone give me some advice on how to tell if i&#039;ve been sent pollen, or just bog-standard soapbar?

				pollum is softer and stickier, you need much less heat to crumble it,the smoke isn&#039;t as harsh like soapbar smoke.

				If its pollen, its got to be light in color than most of the soapbar shit being pressed with lesser force. and pollen tastes smooth and stony..Hope it helps :D<br /><br />

				Good pollen will need only the briefest heat to crumble and has a fine sandy texture when you do, it also smells much cleaner when burned and as already stated is light in color. Tends to give a clear not over heavy high as well.
