				There is a pretty high chance there are authorities that use SR.<br />Don&#039;t panic quite yet - if this is your first purchase I hope you chose to read up on what to do just in case anything goes wrong, though if you made an educated choice, you should be fine! :)<br />In the future, don&#039;t order from anyone that doesn&#039;t give you a lot of confidence. If they have good feedback on the forums and on the site, you are usually in good hands!<br />Also, it is usually recommended you use your real name vs a fake one.

				That&#039;s what is so ingenious about SR.&nbsp; The rating system works both ways to protect buyers and sellers.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy from a seller with just a few reviews if you have a bad feeling about it.&nbsp; For me, intuition is there even if my vision is impaired, yea!&nbsp; Knowing I can go just throw on a spare, on the highway of life, resharpen my sight.&nbsp; What I mean is that I trust my gut feeling!&nbsp; Ratings can be faked so 1 or two 5/5 could still be sketchy.&nbsp; If something is too good to be true, it usually is....key word usually.

				Then go with a larger, more reputable seller and look in athe rumor mill for their review page.&nbsp; Unless you like some kind of obscure drug, you should be able to find a vendor that has been around for months/a year with over 300 transactions.

				Seems like a lot of people understandably get very nervous with their early orders. I am also new and have had some successful orders. I made the mistake of getting too excited and placing multiple orders (all small) on the same day, and then read you should only place and wait on one order at a time, at least early on. I had an &quot;Oh shit!&quot; moment but everything worked out surprisingly well. I did do research on each vendor and only ordered from vendors that felt right to me. Use the forums in addition to the ratings. Lastly, I would order within your own country if possible. Cross border adds more risk. Again, I am very new and am no expert. My comments are based on about a month of &quot;experience. Lastly, lastly, you should be fine.

				As long as you use a reputable vendor they should take good care of you :)<br /><br />But I feel like it it is the best idea to put your real name and real address on the package. Postal workers do not think about what&#039;s in each package they deliver, but they might take more notice if there is a package for someone who they have never delivered to before or an address that they haven&#039;t been to.

				You really shouldnt make orders to your address under a name that isn&#039;t yours. Its more suspicious and will make it more likely that the postman won&#039;t deliver it because he knows no one by that name receives mail at your house. If it really is a narc, and you used your real name, then theres still plausible deniability to keep you safe. Anyone can order drugs to your house under your name but as long as you don&#039;t sign for the package there&#039;s no evidence to incriminate you.

				I use fake names because on a regular basis I get 30-40 packages a week because I buy and sell a lot of thing online.&nbsp; I use fake names on some of my legitimate accounts where I order regular stuff... and basically the postal workers don&#039;t even look at the names.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been able to get to know my mail deliverers pretty well to the point where I know their schedules and I would know if there was someone delivering who shouldn&#039;t be.

				You have to assume there&#039;s bacon on the road and here on the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />My first advice is to do a lot of&nbsp; research before you do business with someone on here.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the best parts of this system!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been buying for around 6 months, with a dozen orders for over 2-grand and I have not had a single bad experience!&nbsp; I think its because I am so selective who I buy from.&nbsp; I only order from vendors with reasonable terms (no FE!) and good reviews, but an active forum presence is just as important!&nbsp; You have to be comfortable with who you buy from and building (or even reading) a dialogue is a great way to do so.<br /><br />And after you order, try to relax.&nbsp; It&#039;s always a little stressful.&nbsp; Research what to do when it arrives, then roll a j and kick back...<br />Trust the &lt;&lt;vibes&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br /><br />Mailing to your home is not the safest choice as your name kills some deniability (but not all by any means).&nbsp; Most vendors expect you to use a legitimate name and address however.&nbsp; Try and find an address not connected to you (and preferably with nothing illicit) to mail to.&nbsp; That way you&#039;re not mailing to your stash house either!&nbsp; PO boxes are another option, but you have ZERO deniability if LE is watching it.

				Agreed.&nbsp; I would always recommend not using a fake name as multiple packages with a fake name can be fishy to your mail man.&nbsp; The amount of resources it would take to begin investigating the millions of domestic packages that come thru the USPS would be astronomical.&nbsp; I remember my first few orders, waiting, and looking out my blinds to see if 1) the mailman came, and 2) if any other suspicious people drove by...knock on wood but after 2 years and zero issues I have never been scared again :)

				dude you&#039;re just anxious and freaking out chill it&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />When you look at a vendor make sure you not their review page and read it first! and ALWAYS research the exact product that you are looking at in association to your vendor on the forums.

				Almost impossible.<br /><br />Think here.<br /><br />If a vendor makes an account, and ships out a shitty order, they&#039;re going to get shitty feedback. If they don&#039;t ship out anything, they&#039;re going to get shitty feedback.<br /><br />It would be impossible for a vendor to be authorities because they would have to actually ship drugs to people, which I don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to do :P<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the government is going to waste 3.5 BTC and ship tons of drugs out to people to catch one or two people. Just never order from someone with less than 10 or 20 feedback. Also make sure the feedback is for something that is in the drugs section or else it could be possible it was the government, but I doubt they would do that to catch one user. They could go out on the streets and catch 20+ users in less than a night if they wanted to.
