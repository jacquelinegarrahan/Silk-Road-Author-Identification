				I assume you mean .1g every hour or so? <br />Either way some safety measures are to use a clean straw or something like that (not a bill) and don&#039;t share that straw.&nbsp; Also rinse your nostrils out before you go to sleep or use a netti pot or whatever they&#039;re called.&nbsp; <br />I don&#039;t do much so I don&#039;t really take my own advice often, but just remember to be as clean and safe as possible and know what your limits are.

				as long as you&#039;re healthy and don&#039;t have a heart condition, you should be fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s the active cuts and combination with depressants that makes charlie real deadly.

				as people mentioned above, clean cocaine is not too dangerous, but it affects blood pressure and the heart. <br /><br />thing with the cuts though, you could still get some buzz and don&#039;t realize until later that there was some nasty stuff in the product.<br /><br />maybe keep some benzos handy to calm down if you get a bad experience.<br /><br />you&#039;ll eventually get the idea what it could be cut with, buy your side effects (or maybe you are always getting good stuff :)<br /><br />also, with good product you need less since it would work nicely, if it&#039;s bad quality and doesn&#039;t work then it&#039;s easy to start doing more, and get bad side effects if some caffeine or meth type stuff used as a cut.

				I would suggest to start with a low dose and up it carefully since the SR stuff is really potent material in most cases and not compareable with cut street cocaine.<br /><br />But .1 every hour should be perfectly fine. :)<br /><br />Have a nice sniff!<br /><br />Edit: I want to underline this because even tough I call myself a experienced coke user I had to suffer a little OD from SR stuff because I underestimated this kind of stuff!<br /><br />Less is more sometimes!
