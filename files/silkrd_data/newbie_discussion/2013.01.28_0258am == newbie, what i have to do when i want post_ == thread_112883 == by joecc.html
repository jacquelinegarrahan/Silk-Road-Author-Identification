				Seriously, its not a prison at all. ??? It&#039;s a place to learn as much as you can and ask relevant questions instead of hitting 50 posts and then asking these types of questions on the main Forum. It is worrying that some new members don&#039;t take their Anonymity whilst purchasing illegal drugs, seriously enough and don&#039;t realize the implications and consequences they face once their anonymity has been compromised. :( :(

				I assume things so I am probably wrong at calling the Newbie discussion a prison. Before I even downloaded the TOR browser I understood the tools and steps to keeping myself anonymous and safe from LE. I understood 2-3 different ways to get BTCs and how to tumble them before sending them to my SR wallet. I downloaded the encryption tool and watched multiple tutorials on how to use it. As soon as I understood all that I then allowed myself to actually access the website and view the SR.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand how people would need to ask a question about general purchasing when all of the information is out there to find on your own.

If what you say is true, why not help some other newbie&#039;s out who might need a helping hand? I&#039;m sure they will appreciate the help. One thing I will say though, there is a lot more to learn and master if you honestly believe what you&#039;ve posted is all that&#039;s required to remain anonymous. The topics you&#039;ve mentioned are the very basics, but it&#039;s only the tip of the iceberg across a broad range of subjects that will eventually require your attention.
