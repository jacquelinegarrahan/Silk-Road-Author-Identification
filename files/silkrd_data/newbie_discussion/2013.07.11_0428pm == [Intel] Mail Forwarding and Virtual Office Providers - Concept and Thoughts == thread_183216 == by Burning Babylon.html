				This is going to be an Intelligence Gathering thread for the thread Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143742 I want to keep this thread separate as there&#039;s too much information over there already and the scope of this thread will eventually become bigger. Originally I was supposed to do all Intelligence Posts with the branch of Burning Babylon named Oneiros Distribution but due to clumsiness on my part I&#039;ve lost the Forum Password for that user, so I&#039;m going to just speak for both branches through this account. :P<br /><br />Intelligence will be gathered mostly in the form of e-mail correspondence and scouring their sites for information. I&#039;ll be structuring my listings based on Regions and will try and gain information on all Mail Forwarders and Virtual Offices per said Region. Each post will detail a separate Region and will be continuously updated when new information comes in. This post will be a index listing each Region where I&#039;ve either initiated Intelligence Gathering or completed it, see status for each post for details.<br /><br />Anyone can feel free to contribute by for example registering with a random provider and then detailing exactly how they operate, for free spam see my thread Postal Spam - Where and How? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178446.0<br /><br />&lt; Censored; From now on the List is only available to Participants in Project Mercury - The Quest for an ideal Black Market Site &gt;

				&nbsp;You&#039;ve really hyped this thread up. As far as I&#039;m aware, only a handful of schmucks care about mail forwarding.<br /><br />&nbsp;Package arrives at mail forwarding company along with federal liaison. &quot;We were just forwarding&quot;. Onto the next stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you want to fuck around then open your own mail forwarding company and trick us all into sending out packages through you. You can rob em and let me pass and maintain your deniability when you accidentally open the one thats marked for a fake address and has a kilo of coke that YOU paid for.
