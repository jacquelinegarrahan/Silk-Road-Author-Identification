				Wtf is going on, either you&#039;ve paid for a vendor account to advertise youself as a scam from day 1 which is ridiculous or you&#039;ve made a forum account with the same name as the vendor but you are not him and are only here to discredit him, rightly so as he&#039;s been here 4 days and is asking everyone to FE. I&#039;ve reported this to a mod btw.

I imagine a lot of shady vendors tell their newbie clients that they can still get a refund even after having FEd, I say this because I once saw a complaint by a poor scammed individual saying that&#039;s what the vendor told them. To be honest I think the finalize button is far too easy to accidentally click anyway and needs a warning of some kind, but especially first time buyers should be redirected to some kind of information page the first time they click finalize which explains exactly what it is. I know there&#039;s a warning under the finalize button but let&#039;s remember Einstein&#039;s words: Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the first one.

				No one should be FE for a new vendor who hasn&#039;t met the criteria to ask for FE, if you see that behavior report it immediately.<br /><br />Secondly no one should be FE for domestic AU regardless, just stop doing it period and it will help stem the tide of FE scamming.<br /><br />Escrow is there for a reason, please use it and always refuse to FE no matter what the vendor tells you.
