				Yeah man. Its shit. Im sorry. Ive been burned a few times on here, and I feel your pain. I just always remind myself that Im in this for the ideology and getting burned is a risk I take because I believe in a free global unregulated market. I just wish all the sellers were here for the same reason. Too many scum bags and lowlifes taking advantage of others, its sad.&nbsp;

				I find it always pays to go with an experienced vendor.&nbsp; <br />There are a lot of teens and you g guys selling who don&#039;t have much responsibly and skill.&nbsp; Hiding behind a vendor account.&nbsp; You can tell though, by he number of transactions. Read the feedback and you do well

				I once got an order of 3.5 grams of coke instead of my correct order of 1/4 oz of weed.&nbsp; &nbsp; A good score.&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor let me keep it.&nbsp; And he sent the weed too.&nbsp; Nice.

				Yea, I got burned about amonth ago from a vendor I already ordered from. He went awol for a week after I FEd about 100 bucks- dumb idea since I have pretty good stats. He replied saying he was having personal issues and has claimed to have &quot;sent&quot; a package but I think he got me mixed up. I left him bad feedback and sent him a message saying I would spread his bad wrap on the forums. He then replied calling me Impatient and a blackmailer. lol There have been over 10 positive feedbacks on his page since<br /><br />Anyways apparently dude is going though a hard family time and is finally &quot;sending&quot; a bountiful package. Will see in about a week. Ive seen this guys feedback go from 100 to 88 since, and much of that is from my orders. Ill give his name if I dont get it in about a week

				Greentrees, you are a god damned idiot.<br /><br />I&#039;m so thankful for people like you. If it wasn&#039;t for you, scamming vendors would have to look elsewhere for people to rip off.<br /><br />Luckily, you&#039;re keeping them busy with that easy FE money.<br /><br />Seriously, learn how to read and research before you even think about buying shit.<br /><br />You aren&#039;t going to get a single penny if you FE&#039;d.
