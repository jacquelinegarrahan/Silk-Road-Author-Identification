				If you think your account was hacked and you can&#039;t get into it, you&#039;ll need to create a new account and message SR Support from that new account, asking them to reset the password on your original account.&nbsp; They&#039;ll ask for some info to prove the accounts belong to you, and then they&#039;ll help get it reset.&nbsp; I believe I&#039;ve read recently that there is a 72 hour wait period before they&#039;ll reset it.
