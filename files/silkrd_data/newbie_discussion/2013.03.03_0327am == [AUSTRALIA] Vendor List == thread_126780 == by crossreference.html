				( For search function benefit: Australia Aus Aussie Oz Ozzie Australian )<br /><br />I&#039;m a newb to SR and looking at purchasing from domestic (Australian) vendors. The search function has proven difficult to really get a grasp of up-to-date credible vendors so I thought this thread might be useful to us Australians looking to purchase domestically.<br /><br />Australian vendors please post in here briefly detailing products available, or just provide a link to your page.<br /><br />Australian buyers please post in here providing list of vendors you have purchased from and results of your transaction, i.e. satisfactory, great, poor, would/wouldn&#039;t recommend, etc.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I&#039;m looking for Aussie connections and vendors in particular. After fake or real ID. Drivers licence, Medicare card, bank card. The Medicare card and bank card don&#039;t have to work. It&#039;s just for the 100 points test. A passport would also be useful but they tend to be to expensive.

				To find aussie vendors you can search products and pick your country as the only shipping option. To have vendors post they are aussie here will only help narrow LE searches for certain users and their products......

				I saw a PP seller. $600 for an Aussie PP. They sell lots of others also. Problem is you can never tell if its legit.<br /><br />Come to think of it how can a fake passport be legit? I&#039;m confused&nbsp; :o

They need to be in the system, so when you enter of leave a country, it identifies as a real passport. The fake details are entered into the passport database. That&#039;s how they work.<br />They are made by corrupt people who work in the passport / immigration departments.<br />They have access to what&#039;s needed to make passports, so they can use these to charge people who want a new identity huge amounts of money for a real passport with fake details on them.<br />They are extremely difficult to acquire and would cost thousands of dollars if you want to buy one because of the risk involved.

				Yes that makes sense. The passport I was looking at wasn&#039;t supposed to be used as a basis to travel though, just as general identification. There would be no details in any official database so if the cops or Centrelink looked it up you would be screwed of course.
