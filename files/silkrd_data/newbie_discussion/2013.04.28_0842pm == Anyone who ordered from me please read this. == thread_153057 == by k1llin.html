				I changed my password yesterday because I just wanted to be safe and I guess my idiot self wrote down the password that I changed to and now I don&#039;t remember it. I tried contacting Dread Pirate Roberts but he didn&#039;t reply. So if you guys want to message me here in the meanwhile while I get this figured out, that&#039;s fine. Btw, if you order priority shipping last week then it should be there tomorrow.

				To get your password reset, you need to start a new account over on SR and from that account, send a message to SR Support or Vendor Support and tell them that you locked yourself out.&nbsp; They&#039;ll ask for info to prove the account belongs to you, and then they&#039;ll reset your password.<br /><br />However, if the site and marketplace are under attack, it&#039;s likely you won&#039;t hear from anyone until that has been resolved.
