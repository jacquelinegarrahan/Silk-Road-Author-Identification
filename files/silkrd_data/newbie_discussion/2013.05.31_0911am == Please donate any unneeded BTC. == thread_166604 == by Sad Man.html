				I know how much we all care for for each other on this online community. Ive never been an active member in the forums but I have learned much and most of all is the love that is ever present and always there when you need it most.<br />I would never usually beg but after losing my wife and my kids in a tragic Polar Bear attack while on a camping holiday in the Siberian Arctic in 2012, l have never forgiven myself for not being there to save them. It was the Superbowl and I had put our life savings on the Patriots. So while I was on the couch stuffing my face with corn chips and smoking bowl after bowl of some dope ass Skunk from Amsterdam my wife and young children both twin girls aged 4 were fighting off a starved Polar Bear mother with cubs, I had just lost our house and all its contents when the maffia loan sharks Id not been able to repay for the 2011 Superbowl results had decided they&#039;d had enough of my excuses to repay them. Damn those Steelers!!!<br />So Im begging all of you to spare a man a Bitcoin or 2 to help him get back on his feet. I really need whatever you can spare. <br />All donations will go to a needy cause. I just know its the Chiefs this year. <br /><br />All donations please send to<br /><br />1CGW74FHZfUJkqLKHJP49HbgMxChneBoVq<br /><br /><br />The next Superbowl isnt till Feb 2014 so there is plenty of time to throw a needy man a BTC or 2.<br />Thank you all in advance. <br /><br />And as I hitch hike through our great nation if anyone knows a good loan shark in the Portland or Seattle area PM me. I cant lose this year. <br /><br />And if anyone has some good insider footy tips PM me too along with your donations.<br />Thanks yall.

				Thank you so much. I knew you guys were good for it but wow, so many donations in such a short time. Im lost for words. Keep em comin guys. I might even afford a bed tonight. This old piece of cardboard is starting to get a bit tattered and stinky. <br />And for all you tipsters out there flooding my inbox with your predictions all I have to say is thanks but nothing has convinced yet the Cheifs are still a sure bet. If I can raise at least a few 1000 BTC by Feb Ill shout you all a beer after the game back in my penthouse in Miami. Its the least I could for ya&#039;ll. So stop now and donate towards that beer of glory. <br />Sad Man still has much more needed so dont hold back.
