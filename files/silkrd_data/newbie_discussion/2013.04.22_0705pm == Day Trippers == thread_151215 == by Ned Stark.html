				Research my friend!<br /><br />Look at the links in the Rumour Mill. Use the search button.<br /><br />E.G. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />If I was going to order I would go to Jesus of Rave first of all as his stuff is legit and he is a good seller.<br /><br />

Too intense to be enjoyable for me. LSD is smoother, it lasts a long time but on your comedown you will have lots of nice little &quot;peaks&quot; where things start to get trippy again for a moment, long enough to enjoy what&#039;s going on. LSD won&#039;t have you pumped up and excited the same way 2Cs will, you will be giddy, but not nearly the same way as 2Cs will.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just my opinion, some people actually prefer 2Cs<br /><br />Sources: My own limited experience with psychedelics.

				2C&#039;s all make me sick as fuck usually, 2C-B I throw up hardcore everytime no matter the dosage right before I start tripping, 2C-I makes me feel like totall shit, and 2C-E makes me feel like total shit while throwing up multiple times the entire trip, and the puke was like all white and foamy looking and I couldnt intake any fresh water or it would stir in my stomach and I would throw it up with mad foam. But, the most magicall 2C ever (for me anyways) was 2C-P. I took 5 to 7 or so the amount needed for a &quot;strong trip&quot; and I had no negative side effects whatsoever, I tripped for like 3 days straight with a near 20 some hour peak in the middle. And it really was a straigh 20 hour peak, I&#039;m talking same intensity the whole time, same crazy ass everything swirling around and mad changing colors and shape at the same intensity for 20 fucking hours!! I could see how someone could have a bad trip in this situation but I had so much fun and it really was one of the most amazing trips I have ever had. Probably the closest Phen. I&#039;ve ever had to LSD was the 2C-P, it lasts LONGER than LSD too!

				I really like it. It keeps you on a more normal sleep schedule, rather than being up all night and then either sleeping all day the next day or being overly tired.

				Personally, I really love to start in the night and get over the whole next day.<br /><br />I prefer MDMA or coke as my drug of choice, but friends around me doing stuff like keta, 2c-p and acid.<br /><br />They also love to see the sun rising on a nice, warm spring/summer day.<br />Then we stay awake the day, it gives the best situations when you combate fatigue the whole time :D
