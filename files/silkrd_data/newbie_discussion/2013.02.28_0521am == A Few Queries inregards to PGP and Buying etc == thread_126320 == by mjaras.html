				Hi there guys I have been trying to find answers to the following questions for the last few hours and cant so resorting to this.<br />First of all please correct me if im wrong: From what I have gathered when you want to buy some product you send encrypted messages though the silk road message system with you address and other details. Then/or before Transfer the required btc from your SR btc wallet to the user name of the vendor. Is this how it works? <br /><br />In regards to setting up my pgp i have gotten as far as creating my own public and private keys and have tried importing the public key of the vendor from a .txt file using gpg --import savedkey.txt(name of the .txt file on desktop with the public key of vendor in it) but it says :<br />C:\Users\Mike&gt;gpg --import lucykey.txt<br />gpg: can&#039;t open `lucykey.txt&#039;: No such file or directory<br />gpg: Total number processed: 0<br /><br />so i must be doing something blatantly wrong can someone please point it out?<br /><br />MUCH APPRECIATED :D

With respect to your first two questions. Your address, and any other information encrypt is sent to the buyer at the time that you make a purchase. Part of the purchase process involces SR confirming you have the coins to pay for what you buy. When you add something to your&nbsp; SR trolley, and select a postage type, there will be an area to add your encrypted address. When you select buy, SR checks that you have the coin, if you don&#039;t have enough, the transaction goes no further. If you do have the coins, the coins are held in &quot;Escrow&quot; by SR. This means that the SR site actually holds your coins until you Finalize the purchase. You should only Finalize once your purchase has arrived. Escrow protects you by only releasing the funds once you confirm the goods have arrived.<br /><br />With respect to your pgp question. I often get the same error finally worked out what it is. All PGP keys begin and end like this<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.18 (Darwin)<br /><br />Make sure that the five dashes at the start of the key are hard up against the left hand column of text.<br /><br />The text below is correct and the pgp key will be imported<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.18 (Darwin)<br /><br /><br />The following text is incorrect, and the pgp will not be imported<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.18 (Darwin)<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya

				I hate it when people accidentally make their answer part of the quote...<br /><br />I have no clue if you said this, but you&#039;re in the wrong directory.&nbsp; The file doesn&#039;t exist, so of course it wont&#039; import.&nbsp; You need to type this first:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">cd Desktop<br /></code><br />... then type the same thing again and it will import.&nbsp; Your desktop is the directory &quot;C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop&quot;<br />
