				Probably a stupid question, but is there any risk in using fake information for Bitinstant deposits?<br /><br />Bitinstant&#039;s site requires entering name and DOB, and the process of getting the money you&#039;re asked for name, address, and phone number. I made a small deposit at a CVS using my real info as a test to see what the process is like, but it seems like at no point is the information provided verified.<br /><br />My only concern is, in case something goes awry with the deposit, it might be tough to get the money back if you&#039;ve provided an alias.<br /><br />While there&#039;s nothing directly illegal with purchasing bitcoins, it doesn&#039;t hurt to be safe and anonymous. How do you guys do it?

				I&#039;ve got no problem using my real info buying Bitcoin like that but then again I tumble it through a few throwaway services before I ever let it touch something not legal. I probably overkill it but you never know.

				From my own experience, <br />It really doesn&#039;t matter what name you use on the bit instant order page. All that&#039;s relevant on that site is your email address, as far as the moneygram to btv address option goes.&nbsp; When you are redirected to the zip zap page, make sure you keep note of that phone number you used.&nbsp; Then when you go make the moneygram payment, you can use any name you want (preferably go to a liquor store or some hole in the wall place) but make sure you use the phone number you enetered on the zip zap page. The phone number is very important....unfortunately zipzap doesn&#039;t allow you to make more than 1 payments in one day, only way they can recognize you is by your phone number though...So you&#039;de have to make multiple orders with multiple phone numbers.

				Thanks guys, this is helpful. I questioned the necessity for tumbling services when SR has its own tumbler -- the main concern I had was whether law enforcement keeps track of frequent Moneygram payments to convert to BTC somehow... I have to think that BTC is still mostly used for illegitimate purchases these days despite the number of legal things you can buy.<br /><br />Snickerlover, regarding the phone number, I&#039;m assuming you can use a fake one since I don&#039;t think my phone number was ever verified at any point in the process?

				I agree with Sliver.&nbsp; Like it&#039;s been noted, nothing wrong with buying bitcoins.&nbsp; I use bitinstant to a wallet then to SR.
