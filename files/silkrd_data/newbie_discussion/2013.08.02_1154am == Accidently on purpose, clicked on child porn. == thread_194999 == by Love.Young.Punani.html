				Hey you guys over here already, I think I&#039;m a paedophile, because I was and am intrigued by these C,P sites. I found a couple, ones called Lolita City, now this is a bit gross, because there are young children. You can select the the group which you desire and eliminate the rest, for instance, I picked 12-16 year old girls. Then I found another called prime ass teens, and I swear this place is so heaven to me, I know I will be shunned and ostracized but I&#039;m addicted to it. These like 14-16 year olds, in all manner of poses, and when I&#039;ve had a little points, I&#039;m insatiable. I stop when I&#039;ve come, and then I feel disgusting. Help please.

				You need help my friend. Don&#039;t worry, many peadophiles lurk in this community, they just don&#039;t dare admit it. I&#039;ll send my blessings, as we are all gods children. Perverted or not.

				You&#039;re experiencing a mental illness and should seek psychotherapy. You&#039;re still a human being, bro, you just got a problem that you need to deal with.

				I wrote my thesis on CP addiction for my masters.<br />If you&#039;ve just started, it will be much easier to stop.<br />The more you browse, the more your brain will be rewired to ONLY be attracted to these girls.<br /><br />Do you have any attraction to older (18+) girls? Or are you exclusively attracted to the 12-16 age range?<br /><br />I have a few more questions that would make it easier for me help you, but I want to make sure you&#039;re going to actively participate in this discussion before I waste my time.<br /><br />Just 2 quick things:<br /><br />1) Technically, you&#039;re not a pedophile-pedo&#039;s are attracted to PRE pubescent girls. The term for your affliction is ephebophilia, and it is VERY common. Remember, until the Industrial Revolution, when many children were needed to man the tills, it was common for girls to marry at 12 and pump the first kid out at 13. Another little known fact-when the &quot;immaculate conception&quot; occured- Joseph was believed to be in his late 20&#039;s/early 30&#039;s-Mary was 12 or 13!! <br /><br />You have to realize that many, many people are attracted to teenagers. The thing is, most people have the sense to control it-sure, you can check out the cute girls in the mall, maybe linger for a half beat too long on their booties or whatever-but that&#039;s as far as it can go! Which brings us to our second point-<br /><br />2) THIS SHIT CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE! If you let it get out of hand, you WILL get addicted to CP, and you WILL build a vast collection. Sooner or later, the pics and vids aren&#039;t going to be enough-you&#039;re going to go out and try to &quot;groom&quot; your own little lolita.&nbsp; Somewhere along the line, you&#039;re going to get so fucking busted. And once you get busted for something like this, life as you know it is OVER. As absolutely miserable as prison will be, just wait til you get out-good look finding a job, a place to live, friends-being on the registry will absolutely ruin your life. <br /><br />Get help now while you can. Message me or whatever and I&#039;ll try to guide you through it.&nbsp; I ended up changing career paths, but I do know quite a bit about the psychology of a lot of this shit, and I think I can help out.
