				I posted this on the newbie board since I am a new user (although I had another acct name but forgot it&nbsp; :-\)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t created a seller&#039;s account yet because I don&#039;t have all the equipment I need to pack and ship properly. Plus I would like to get a few purchases under this new account so I can build somewhat of a reputation. There are a lot of great drugs that I can get at premium prices and sell for 2-3X as much depending on the market. Ether way I still wish to provide my customers witht eh best stealth possible and protect my ass at the same time. I&#039;d love to hear from some vendors that have experience with shipping and paying for postage. <br /><br />Basically I have invested in a foodsaver with vacuum bags and an impulse sealer for sealing mylar bags. I don&#039;t know if the vacuum seal is necessary or even helpful, but I figured it couldn&#039;t hurt as long as it was sealed in high grade Mylar which I plan to drop an oxygen absorber in (I haven&#039;t seen a single vendor do that). I may end up returning the foodsaver plus if the Mylar impulse sealer works well enough (I should get it tomorrow)<br /><br />Anyways my main questions and concerns is the shipping process. How do I go about mailing out packages and create real looking business return addresses. I have found plenty of info on the stickies about packaging, but barely anything about shipping. It seems like a smart idea would be to use different drop boxes all around town. Another concern of mine is how do I pay for postage without visiting the PO or putting a bunch of stamps on the package (which would obviously look suspicious)<br /><br />Sorry again for posting this in the newbie section as it obviously belongs in the shipping forum. Mods feel free to move it.
