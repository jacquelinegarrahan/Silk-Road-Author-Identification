				Here is a poll with all the drugs available on SR plus alcohol. <br /><br />You should vote for your preferred drug. Only 1. <br /><br />If you are not sure about your preferred drug, then asking the following question may help:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You are on a dessert island and you are gifted with a coupon to order something from SR, but only one order.

				Definitely high grade marijuana!!! Everything else is fun every now and then to mix with said high grade marijuana, but if left with the choice of only one drug for the rest of my life, I would chose the one that I have depended on daily for the last 12 years of said life and has provided me with the best and most gratifying results.&nbsp; With that being said, I think one needs to also ask is marijuana a drug?&nbsp; By the governments standards it is but by mine and millions of others, it&#039;s just a plant.&nbsp; But for the sake of this poll, it is the best drug in existence.&nbsp; TO me.

				Hard question to answer as I am a poly-substance abuser and like to go up, down and all around at will - grew up on speed, smack, weed and acid ... but my all-time fave (after many decades of indulgence) would have to be the big H. <br />&lt;nods off and drools on self&gt;

				Oh and by the way I voted for Cannabis.&nbsp; My favorite drug by far!&nbsp; With all the different strains out there you can smoke for years and still try something new that you haven&#039;t had before.&nbsp; Big fan of Sativas.&nbsp; White Widow is the best I&#039;ve ever smoked.&nbsp; It was Cali medical bud I got at a dispensary and grown to perfection.&nbsp; It was so sticky I actually broke the crank off my Sharpstone grinder and the bud was just stuck to the grinder teeth.&nbsp; Had a very high tolerance at the time and it got me so ripped.&nbsp; Lamb&#039;s Breath is one of my other favorite strains.&nbsp; It is noted that Bob Marley really enjoyed this strain and I understand why.&nbsp; It was very unique and did something extra profound for music enjoyment.&nbsp; Marijuana chances music for me.&nbsp; But with lamb&#039;s breath it just made music that much more enjoyable.&nbsp; Really something special.&nbsp;

				Such a weak spot for speedballs.....if I had known about heroin withdrawl I probably would never have abused them as much as I have.<br /><br />I get them in 2-3 weeks so once my Methylone order arrives and I sell that I should be able to afford to purchase a vendor account and start selling them at that price. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t have a reliable way to purchase BTC using MoneyGram/Western Union from Canada &gt;.&lt;

THEY ARE NOT THE SAME<br /><br />Ritalin is NOT an amphetamine. I have been on Ritalin and i hated it so much i stopped. Adderall is totally different if you are using it to manage legitimate psychiatric issues. (it is also better recreationally).<br /><br />Ritalin made me so irritable and angry:: all i wanted to do is drive nails into my eyes-- horrible drug<br /><br />when people compare the too it is only because some of the side effects are the same-- like increased blood pressure<br /><br />But the feeling is 100% different in terms of how I feel on it. I have rarely come across anyone who has used both and said ritalin is better. Ritalin is a shitty drug in my opinion
