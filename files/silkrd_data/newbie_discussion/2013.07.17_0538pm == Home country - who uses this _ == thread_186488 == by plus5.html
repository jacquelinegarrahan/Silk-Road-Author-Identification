				Hi peeps - Can anyone tell me the pros and cons of selecting your correct home country in your account settings versus leaving it as &quot;undeclared&quot;. I&#039;m guessing if you do, then you can select show &quot;Domestic&quot; vendors only. This saves some time searching for vendors if you are only interested in vendors in your own country.<br /><br />I guess some might say they is some increased risk if you narrow your account down to a particular country.<br /><br />What do people think ?

				No, there&#039;s a &quot;Domestic Only&quot; button on the SR list. It shows Domestic Only if you have that ticked.<br /><br />The Home Country button is used for displaying local currency (IIRC) so I get to see BTC prices converted to Pounds Sterling, etc.

				plus5 has it right<br /><br />home country toggles the domestic only option<br />currency is set separately for example you could set it up to be in the u.s. but see the prices in pounds sterling<br /><br />yea i suppose its a tiny bit riskier whatever i have mine set

				Unless you live in the Vatican or some similar tiny place, I suspect that profiling someone based on the country would be so difficult that LE doesn&#039;t bother to try. The swine can&#039;t be shocked at discovering that: &quot;Holy Crap!! We have a drug dealer in our country, let&#039;s go look for him after coffee break.&quot;

				Home country isn&#039;t just for making the domestic option function, it also filters out listing which aren&#039;t shipped to your country.&nbsp; It&#039;s handy for removing all the USA-&gt;USA listings.

				This has already been said in a post above but I use it mainly for the domestic option. I don&#039;t order anything outside my own country.

				Really depends on how shiesty you are.<br /><br />If you have no reason to strongly prefer domestic vendors or resellers, and want much larger quantities for whatever reason (drugs by the kilogram, fuck yeah), delcaring your country of residence doesn&#039;t really benefit you.<br /><br />However, if you are some starving college student or lazy bum in your mother&#039;s basement, you may want to purchase exclusively from domestic resellers at small single-dose quantities, or even conduct group-buy operations to keep costs down.<br /><br />As you can read, I am not a fan of being any cheaper than you need to be.

				I just did an update with my other account on the thread Domestic Listings per Country/Region on Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176825 - an interesting point is currently 27.07 % of all listings here on Silk Road are undeclared, meaning they won&#039;t show up for any person which has the option &quot;Domestic Only&quot; enabled.<br /><br />Now ideally there would be a system where one just clicks exactly what countries or states to filter out as I&#039;ve suggested in the thread Upgraded Listing Options: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182090 but until then a lot of people are going to use Domestic Only and miss out on a lot of listings by doing so it appears.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit perplexing seeing most underground sites adopting the ISO 3166-1 standard ( http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/country_names_and_code_elements.htm ) for listing regions to various degrees when there&#039;s so many regions which can&#039;t possibly show up here ever. I&#039;m planning on creating a separate thread for a suggestion on what regions to remove.&nbsp; :)
