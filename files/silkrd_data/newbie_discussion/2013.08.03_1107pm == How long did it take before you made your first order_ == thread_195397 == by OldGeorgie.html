				I&#039;ve only been lurking here for not even a week . I browse SR everyday and look at all the goodies I wanna order.I check out the highly rated sellers and daydream about when I actually make a purchase.&nbsp; I want to place an order and wait in anticipation for my package to arrive in the mail. :(<br /><br />&nbsp;So I downloaded GPG4Win a few days ago... trying to figure that stuff out.I got a wallet and I found a localbitcoin.com person that lives near me...haven&#039;t bought any yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />It feels like it may take a long time before I order... maybe a couple of weeks..but I don&#039;t really know. I should just move to Colorado<br /><br />How long did it take you to make your first order? ` <br /><br />&quot;... nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile ...&quot; <br /><br /><br />Peace!

				I was pretty sketched about everything for a while.. but I had a friend who ordered a lot and gave me some tips and guidance.&nbsp; Even so, I probably took 3 or 4 months of researching security, keeping up on the forums, checking out vendors, etc, before I made my first purchase.&nbsp; Then I took a week or 2 buying low cost ebooks and shit to start building a little bit of rep before purchasing.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that was all overkill tho.&nbsp; Still, if there&#039;s ever something you want to be absolutely sure you know all of the facts, and have the whole process nailed down correctly.. and trust you will be safe and/or not ripped off.. this is the time for it.

				It took me about 3 months to place my first order. Not because I was hesitant. Had spent a lot of time lurking and shopping. Then when I was finally ready, and had transferred around $280 to my SR account, I was unable to log in. I tried every day for 5 days, then finally gave up. I was working too much to mess with it. About 2.5 months later, I got a break and tried again. Got in on the first try. Too my great surprise, my $280 was now $1188. BTC had gone way up. I had a great shopping spree.&nbsp; ;D

				Like everyone else here I&#039;ve been on a few months building myself up and learning all I can to pull this off safely, and I&#039;m very close to pulling the trigger, but I have to say, the revelelations that have surfaced in the last week regarding Freedom Hosting taken down, and the FBI injecting javascript to hijack TBB, I&#039;m so paranoid I&#039;m not sure I can do it.<br /><br />I did go to the tor mail site with TBB and got the maintenance message, so I know they may or may not have gotten my ip, which at this point really isn&#039;t cause for concern, since tor mail is legal, but I&#039;m wondering now if they have my IP if I&#039;m on some list now somewhere. So not quite back to square one but I probably won&#039;t order for a while now.

				About a month...<br />First two weeks for to get familiar with forums and choose the right vendors and then some days to understand all about encryption, bitcoins, and how to place an order. But after this, I have like weekly orders coming. I stopped dealing in real life and by now all my substances comes from SR. And why not? Perfect prices, quality and a huge variety! SR is the best

				About a month, but as soon as I was able to log into the site I longingly stared at it every day, waiting until I felt confident enough to order. I&#039;m actually quite glad I waited as many new domestic vendors set up shop during that time and I can now get most things I want without having to go international which is great!

				I just made my first order today - I&#039;ve been using and researching about this place for 3-4 days. I spent the first two days researching everything I could about safe browsing, Bitcoin, and how to use SR, and the rest of that time up until today acquiring Bitcoins, researching vendors, and looking for a product to order. So right now I&#039;m just crossing my fingers and hoping that everything goes well from here on out!

				Former &quot;club&quot; member for 7 years with top shelf Adam vendor. Since then hit or miss. I&#039;ve been doing research for about a month now. Printed a jazillion pages of all the must know topics. Loaded a lot of new software and memorized user names, passphrases, and PINS. Went through most of the categories just to see what vendors were like. Like a flea market, everyone is different.<br /><br />Bought some coins, fogged them, loaded some of them into SR last Saturday, after changing my password, when FH TSHF commenced.&nbsp; First installed thunderbird with enigmail. It makes the PGP go much easier. Made a new key and it tested out fine.<br /><br />Given the turmoil of the weekend, I did not rush to place an order, although I did come close. Reading the threads, watching and learning. Some vendors inventory not always available, new vendors sending me PM offering &quot;free samples&quot;. Gathering research on vendors, might make a few small orders this weekend to build up a customer file.<br /><br />Once I get going I&#039;ll be a very good customer, it&#039;s like going back in a time machine 40 years, really a trip.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; &nbsp;:D ;) :P

				when I first heard of SR a couple years ago I logged in and just looked around, maybe came back a couple times just to check things out. But time from &quot;OK I&#039;m really going to do it now&quot; to actually doing it was, like, not even a day and that included setting up a secure area and getting my pgp key generated and such. Granted I&#039;m familiar with all the various technologies (encrypted storage, pgp and so on) and how to go about keeping my SR life separate from all others.&nbsp; The annoyance was I kept getting second thoughts on a username after ordering something already. Don&#039;t have a single transaction on the latest one but I&#039;ve done a few now with one seller (not mentioning them as they are one of the sellers currently laying low) and whenever I order I put in comments &quot;Yeah this is my new username&quot; <br /><br />Also when I made my first order it wasn&#039;t for a usb drive or something else that&#039;s &quot;safe.&quot; I dove straight in, checked on sellers feedback and all that other stuff you should do and have been great. Although my bank account hasn&#039;t been that great lately ;)

				I started with obtaining bitcoins. Did some research, found btcquick was best for me. Figured out PGP on my mac (took about an hour or so to get fully up and running), browsed for awhile and went to reddit/r/silkroad for vendor recommendations. All in all it took just a couple of days from discovering SR until making my first order.

				I cant believe I am admitting this but in the hope of others not making the same mistakes as I did....<br /><br />Friends of mine were / are regular shoppers here, so I got alot of hints and tips when I was getting started direct from them. Did a little bit of late night research before bed, but nothing too intense. The day I decided I wanted some gear, with a bit of help, I had made my first transaction within a few hours. Since then, have been pretty regular - 1 to 2 transactions per week. <br /><br />Now here is the kicker - most of my early knowledge was from discussions and demonstrations IRL from my friends. I only accessed these forums for the first time a few days ago!! You would not believe how blind I feel. I am so grateful the vendors I went with in those early days were decent.&nbsp; <br /><br />The info you can get from here is invaluable. I feel so silly about how little I knew and how risky it was. Its kinda like I did things backwards......

				I&#039;ve been browsing the forums, doing what research I can into security and understanding SR and the community as much as I can, for about almost year now and still haven&#039;t ordered.

Not because I was hesitant. Had spent a lot of time lurking and shopping. Then when I was finally ready, and had transferred around $280 to my SR account, I was unable to log in. I tried every day for 5 days, then finally gave up. I was working too much to mess with it. About 2.5 months later, I got a break and tried again. Got in on the first try. Too my great surprise, my $280 was now $1188. BTC had gone way up. I had a great shopping spree.&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How did you get the $280 to you SR account? I wanna make a purchase asap I&#039;ve been haunting this site and and still tryin to further understand how it works as far as shipping and other things before i make my purchase but i just wanna have it there for when I&#039;m ready but I&#039;m ver sceptic of it being a fed on the sellers side and or getting ripped off.

				Signed up for SR around beginning of the year then didn&#039;t make first buy until 3 or 4 months later. I was having a hard time figuring out how to get BTC and move them around and then I was worried about buying stuff not generally available for sale on the internet (or most anywhere else except the street corner in a sketchy neighborhood). But once I mad first buy from a very helpful vendor I was off and running. I&#039;m still amazed that this whole Tor, SR, BTC thing exists and works. BUT there are clouds on the horizon; article today says Congress is looking into BTC and ways to regulate crypto-currencies. If Congress gets involved then they will screw it all up. After the feds are done chasing pedophiles (who should be shot on the spot) on the darknet they will come after druggies. They have to keep a high profile so they can continue getting outrageous budgets and headlines. The handwriting is on the wall.

				I was on tor and SR for ages before i made any orders, I found it hard to get BTC in the UK i heard that Barclays Ping it was the way to go then they stopped that.<br /><br />But ive found a great place now the fees are extremely low its costing me about £4 or less transfer fee. Whats everyone else paying?<br /><br />It took me a day or so to order when i had the BTC but id already researched legit vendors etc, Some of them are really helpful, one gave me a few tips when i had PGP issues and was more than happy just to chat about shit in general, seems sound.<br /><br />So far ive been buying for about 2months and its a good idea to shop about and dont stick to the one vendor as ive learned. <br /><br />Ive discovered a new vendor thats doing compressed weed at dirt cheap prices, They have various listings White rhino x Swazi skunk and Northern lights x Swazi skunk. Im waiting on my order but so far great reviews <br /><br />Cheers <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Finally made 4 small orders last weekend, about two weeks after funding the account. No FEs, trying to build relationships with vendors, steady as she goes. The goodies should be starting to roll in pretty soon now. <br /><br />Like Rene used to say back in the 20th Century, Northern Lights &quot;on the way&quot;. <br /><br />Update Aug 16, received two orders placed Aug 11, they were much closer in distance. The other two are farther away and one is even international,&nbsp; they should be here next week. So far so good.
