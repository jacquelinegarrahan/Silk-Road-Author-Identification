				hi everyone, as i am newbie, i need some advice about where should i buy Bitcoins from. I have registered at mtdox.com, but in order to make a bank transfer i need to give a scan of my ID... so, considering i do choose mtdox, it will be ok to transfer BTC to SR account? will this transfer be traceable?&nbsp; Theoretically, i can have more than one BTC wallets, right? I have also downloaded the Bitcoin Client, there i can do the same thing as long as i have BTC? In order to move BTC from mtdox to the wallet of Bitcoin client, then from this client make the transfer to SR,&nbsp; should there be any charges?? <br /><br />I hope someone can help me

				thanks for your reply. I do think of other exchange site as well, but as for getting some BTC from the SR, how will that even be possible if my balance is 0.00?

				The available ways to obtain BTC must differ from country to country. You&#039;re probably not in the US, but in case you are (or in case this is helpful to other readers), I&#039;ve found the easiest method to be 1) create a wallet at Instawallet.org [or Mt Gox or wherever you like]; 2) schedule a deposit at BitInstant.com, using the CVS/Moneygram option, with your instawallet&nbsp; as the receiving address; 3) go to CVS and confirm over the Moneygram phone, then give your cash to a helpful CVS employee. Finally, send your coin from your instawallet to your SR wallet&#039;s address. (A downside of this method is that BitInstant takes a cut, but it&#039;s worth it to me to see the BTC appear in my wallet within the hour.)<br /><br />Use fake name, address, email, phone number, etc. But keep it all written down or memorized, because you&#039;ll have to supply it to the MoneyGram people.<br /><br />I hope that&#039;s helpful to somebody!

				thanks for all the replies. I think i am going to use bitcoin-24.com (accepting Credit card through liqpay) I actually found it through the wiki page https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins . I dont understand the scrub<br /><br />&quot;..dont use tumblers to scrub your coins&quot; I guess this is important when you withdraw BTC to your wallet. When depositing only, why do i need this? When i withdraw from the &quot;web wallet&quot; to my Bitcoin (official release software wallet), and then from this encrypted wallet to SR, i think there wont be no problem. On the other hand if i come to have BTC that want to turn into money, it would be needed there.<br /><br />How do i know if bitcoin-24.com is using trumbler to scrub my coin?? This is something important when buying BTC?? after all they will be spent, and i know SR wil get the coins scrubbed.<br /><br />i want your opinions, thanks for helping a noob. By the way, i have found local dealer (cash) but its 28.8Eur instead of 26.57 that i can actually buy legal. Is buying BTC coins not allowed? if i spent them on SR how can the &quot;police&quot; tell where i have spent it..?
