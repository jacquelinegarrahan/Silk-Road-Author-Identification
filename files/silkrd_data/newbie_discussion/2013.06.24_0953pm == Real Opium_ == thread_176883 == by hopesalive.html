				I have heard it is close to impossible to find real opium. I bought some here, because the price was right, so I knew I wouldn&#039;t lose a lot if the order did not arrive. Well, it arrived in 7 days, international. Trouble is, it did nothing for me.&nbsp; It passed some of the tests I read about on the internet, but it smelled and tasted terrible.&nbsp; Made me sick and maybe made me feel okay for like five minutes. What a disappointment.<br /><br />Does anyone have experience with the real thing?&nbsp; I am pretty sure you will say I would know it if I had it, right?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Living and learning as I live..............<br /><br />Hopesalive

				Why dont you just grow your own? Theyre pretty simple once they sprout, though they can be a bitch to start.

				Well, for one thing I know nothing about it. And I can&#039;t keep houseplants alive let alone try something complicated that I have to mess with. I am just too lazy, I&nbsp; guess, lol<br /><br />Have you done that yourself?

				All ornamental poppies can be milked for opium, but specific varieties are MUCH better, with more alkaloids and such. I think the commercial opium poppies are called &quot;Iranian White&quot;?<br /><br />They&#039;re easy to grow... they&#039;re just flowers. Put seeds in dirt, water sporatically and once they sprout give &#039;em plenty of sun. They&#039;ll grow 2-3 feet tall with one flower-bulb atop a long stalk. Sometime before the flower blooms, but after the bulb is full of sap, you score the exterior of the flower bulb with a pin or dull knife, very shallow so as not to pierce the inner membrane (otherwise the milk will seep INWARD toward the seeds, instead or OUTWARD toward the air). The sap will coagulate and get stick, collecting in little sap blobs.<br /><br />One the sap dries (a few hours), you scape it off with the back of a knife, roll into a little stick ball between your fingers, and lay it somewhere to finish drying. That&#039;s opium, simple as that.<br /><br />Although highly addictive, you would be hard-pressed to produce enough opium to support any kind of habit. Do this with a 3-4 flowers, and you&#039;ll have enough for you and a friend to enjoy a lazy afternoon.

				You make it sound so easy. My problem would be keeping the plants alive and getting them to start blooming. I have an African Violet I can&#039;t even get to bloom, lol<br /><br />Thanks for the info!

				African Violets need sparse water, and must be watered from below, not from the surface.<br />They enjoy steady, low light, and are perfect for indoors.<br />They still need some dark, too. If they&#039;re miniature, they may take 2 years before they bloom.<br />Don&#039;t give up, they depending on you!

				You do make it sound easy, and fun to boot. I might have to plant me some poppies. Are the seeds harvestable and edible, too?

				Thank you for more tips for my African Violet!&nbsp; I only have two plants in my house, and this one has lived a long time.&nbsp; lol However, it hasn&#039;t bloomed for quite some time. I did know they do not like their leaves to get wet.&nbsp; Do you suggest plant sticks/fertilizer to help them bloom? We had a cloudy spring, which did not help at all, but I try to get them as much sunshine as I can.

				The seeds for opium poppies are called Papavar Soneiaform (sorry about that spelling). They are available on the clearnet, through most nurseries, and even on the shelves at walmart as edible poppy seeds. The edible ones are hard to sprout, its better to get from online vendors. They can not be grown indoors because of their very deep tap root and the fact they are sensitive to climate and light cycles. To start the germination, shock the seeds overnight by laying them on a damp paper towel and put them in the fridge, they only sprout during a cold night so thats optimal conditions. Then plant them outside in manure or with other plants in a garden, wait a few weeks for sprouts, and once they all sprout kill all the small ones, leaving enough space for the ones with the most potential. If you dont weed out the small ones they will kill the bigger ones.<br /><br />After a few months they will grow 3-4 feet and grow bulbs (hopefully) as big as golf balls. Wait til these flower and after the petals fall off they are ready for harvest. Score them 1/16 inch diagonally across the bulbs, they will leak a milky white latex fluid which is opium. Leave to dry on plant for 2-4 hours, come back and scrape off with a spoon. This is smokable opium (though not pure). The bulb will then dry out, and can in a few days be broken off for seed collection and to save for opium tea. Seeds from the largest pods should be replanted through this method, while seeds from smaller pods can be made into opium tea, and the pods can do the same. Look up guides for this somewhere else, I might provide links later. <br /><br />BE SURE TO DISGARD OR HIDE SCORED PODS. The plant itself isnt illegal to posess but the scored pods will get you a felony, so dont have harvested opium planted in your front yard. Other than that the flowers are legal and actually beautifully vibrant red. Good luck growing and harvesting!
