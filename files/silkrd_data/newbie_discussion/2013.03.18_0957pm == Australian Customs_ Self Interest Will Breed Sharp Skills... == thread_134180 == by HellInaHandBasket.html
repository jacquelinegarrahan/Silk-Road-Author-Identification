				So we all know the story about how awesome our customs are with finding things and generally making our country the nanny state it is but no real good reason for this has been put forward... till now that is!! This article is a very good read and details the naughty little boys and girls the customs officers have been.. Well if I knew I was going to be able to steal the seized drugs later I&#039;d become like the master intercepter... seriously I&#039;d have that shit locked down...<br /><br /><br />**CLEAR NET AHEAD**---------&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.smh.com.au/national/customs-officials-aware-of-crime-ties-20130315-2g65m.html<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.smh.com.au/national/corruption-threat-facing-customs-laid-bare-at-last-20130315-2g629.html<br /><br />Yes the X-ray machine they use is super freaky good at finding stuff too but what people don&#039;t get is that its a conveyor belt dragging hundreds of letters and parcels under the machine and some dude watching the display looking for things that stand out.. the machine doesn&#039;t stop and alarms ring out unless the dude watching finds the slight difference in colour shad or whatever and then once that dude is involved in the follow threough on the suspisious item the belt keeps rolling and so there is a little gap.. interesting huh.. DOS attack with dummy letters and parcels sent en mass globally could be an interesting &#039;Fuck You&quot; to send their way.. anyway my point is I&#039;d be glued to that fucking nscreen too if I thought I might get a ball of cola out of it!! heh<br /><br />Also interesting;<br /><br /><br />**CLEAR NET AHEAD**---------&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-drug-habits-of-highly-effective-people-20130315-2g5rk.html<br /><br />

				&quot;the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, also responsible for investigating all 6500 federal police, was given the authority to investigate Customs only in 2011. There remain serious doubts about its capacity for the job.<br /><br />It has a paltry budget of $6 million, just 30 staff and has never held a public hearing. Since it was created seven years ago, it has published only 12 reports, none of which has named a single government official about whom a finding has been made.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br /><br />

				The system protecting itself not by hiding things but by simply throwing up bureaucratic smoke and mirrors giving the appearance of accountability but ensuring the tiger has had its claws removed and teeth filed down before any performances are attempted..<br /><br />its a problem when the officials you are charged with keeping accountable are able to have such overwhelming influence and impact on your very job and quality of life... Passive corruption in all its glory..Reinforced by the &#039;boys club&#039; that exists at the top echelon of politics/law/finance/etc where the chances are that you are on good terms with your peers due to a lifetime of schooling, working and playing together or at the very least around each other... <br /><br />How much does it stand to reason though that the officers are going to be good at spotting a suspect letter or whatever when they themselves are advising large syndicates and/or making &#039;stealth&#039; packs to get their stuff through. Its also a great way to hide what you want to get through.. Bust as many little random ones as possible so the numbers look right...<br /><br />The real reason the customs here are effective to the level they are is because its a bottle neck that first slows things down and then the limited population and distribution of it make it easier to cover all exit paths.. maybe not every letter gets looked at but every letter passes through a exit that is being monitored so then its just a numbers game and luck of the draw..
