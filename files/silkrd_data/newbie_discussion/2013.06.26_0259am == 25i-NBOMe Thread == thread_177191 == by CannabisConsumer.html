				While we all get our psot count up let&#039;s have a thread about 25i-NBOMe.<br /><br />Good experiences, bad experiences, side effects, tolerance, cross tolerance, interactions, let&#039;s talk about it all!<br /><br />I&#039;ll start us off. The first time I which I took 25i I was expecting a bit more. 1mg didn&#039;t even show me visuals although I was feeling extreme euphoria and smiling quite controllably.<br /><br />The second time was a different story, I began by taking 1.5mg sublingually. Then the trip took off.<br /><br />I began by watching The Lorax. Then after that I began to peak, seeing my first visuals and seeing fractal patterns. I felt a strongly enhanced sense of morality and I admit I regressed quite a bit but it was overall a positive experience and the only thing I wish is that I could trust the drug&#039;s future side effects. Everything I take it I become a hypochondriac, blaming the 25i for all medical problems regardless of whether they actually stemmed from it or not. An example of this would be a nasty twitch I get in my shoulder after taking the 25i and still get once and a while.<br /><br />Anyways cannabis and 25i go together brilliantly. It really brings out the visuals and helps with discomfort caused by vasoconstriction.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Daaaaamn. Nice timing. I literally booted up Tor today just to start a thread on this topic. <br /><br />I just got some Bomb in the mail and I&#039;m not sure how much to take. I&#039;m a little scared off by it&#039;s lack of history and the various deaths that have happened. It seems a lot of those deaths were insuffalated. I&#039;ve heard some reviews of the stuff I bought from righteous and people were taking half tabs and having pretty experiences. Also read some stuff on erowid and it was a lot f 500 and 300 mic level doses. <br /><br />My first priority is not to die, or fuck up my brain. I think I&#039;ll start slow. What&#039;s ya&#039;ll&#039;s advice?<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some flovent which is a vasodilator, so I might take some puffs on that.

				God I love you!!! where do I start. favorite drug I have ever had.Taken it about 5 times maybe 6. Taken it in powder form from a friend and ordered tabs from a respected vendor. It is my drug of choice. I disagree with the weed though makes everything sketch when I smoke even though it feels great. <br />What I like to do on it is take 2-3 1000ug hcl tabs. wait 30 mins and go on a longboard ride alone or with someone else I dont care. I get amazing visuals and body feeling like nothing else. close to snorting dmt!!!!!(dont know how much people do this) Unlike LSD/Mushrooms I do not get crazy thought loops. Have tried with my girlfriend and we just fuck like champs. Makes sex amazing like MDMA. I love 25i thanks for the post. Hoping to&nbsp; try some 2c family soon...

I feel I&#039;m pretty heavyweight with psys (unfortunately. I&#039;d much rather be a cheap date, hahaha), so maybe that should be good. <br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been doing a lot of shrooms after having done acid for the past year. Man I love shrooms. They&#039;re just so homey and fun. MDMA is good but it&#039;s super happy and sometimes I want to feel like that all the time, which makes the &quot;coming down&quot; part less fun (not bad, but it is kind of like &quot;ah darn), while shrooms is fun, but weird enough that by the time it&#039;s over I&#039;m ready to return to planet earth. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what Bome has in store!

				<br />First the positives: <br />EUPHORIA!!! Thats what i can say about this chem. its a drunk blissed out body load, felt sooooooooo good. <br />Ive done it @10 times, 1.2mg tabs. My first time i flipped out, took 2 tabs so around 4mg. That trip was crazy and landed me in a hospital after i freaked and started rolling around naked,jumping on cars. So be careful! But i found my dose, and it is great. The visuals are kinda user dependent. The first few trips I noticed texturing, some breathing, blood swirling in my hands, but not much else. The last few trips I worked at it abit, focusing my eyes and mind. Then the visuals really kicked in...color outlines all over, then this rainbow lattice work, like webbing, started to come into focus everywhere...the trees were on fire,color waves flowing off of them. After awhile the energy became interactive, like i could grab some of it and make it into forms, shapes and such. <br />But by far my biggest remark about this chem is how it feels and gets one into such an amazing happy state.<br />Music sounds so incredibly wonderful on this and it literally sends orgasms all over me. <br />The onset of&nbsp; this chem feels like a slight drunkness, with very pleasurable twinges all over the body, like being massaged. The ground , particularly stone, takes on a very soft ,pastel touch visually, and everything starts to look crisp and detailed...my vision improves dramatically. I saw a snake about three yards away off the side of a road,and it was well hidden,covered in foliage. But somehow, I sensed it, and my eyes took me to it and I got a picture of it. I doubt i would have noticed it in my normal state. <br />The negs:<br />Chest tightness! The come down is the worst...it can really be bothersome. My hands sweat alot too, and i get shaky, jittery like. But the chest tension is scary...it makes me wonder if im fuking up my heart.<br />I now take a niacin 250mg time release mid trip and towards the end...it helps.<br />

				Always start as low as you can on 25i as the dosage required varies GREATLY between each person. I take .5-1 tab of 1200ug every week or two weeks and even with tolerance I still get where I want to be. For example me and most of my close friends for the first time took 1 tab each and boy did that blow our minds. The first time I tried over a tab the trip was quite uncomfortable(racing rushing thoughts, thinking I was dieing etc...fun times in the end) so I don&#039;t do over 1200ug now. On the other side of the spectrum another friend who tried half a tab for his first time was throwing up within 40 mins and said he literally felt his brain frying and now will never touch it again...so for your own sake I recommend starting on a low dosage.

				I have plenty of experience with &#039;shrooms, LSD, mescaline, MDMA, 2C-T-7 and the like, but I&#039;ve yet to experience what I&#039;ve come to see as &quot;Acid&#039;s kinder, gentler cousin&quot;. All of the reports I&#039;ve read are SO positive (unless you&#039;re a moron who insuflates 2000x the recommended dose... *sheesh*). I also like how affordable it is on SR, hopefully it&#039;ll still be that way when I take my next vacation.<br /><br />Trippin&#039;... it&#039;s worth the wait!

The come up is very gentle if one is walking or moving in some way. If the heart is already elevated abit then it does not feel like &quot;oh my god, my heart is getting faster&quot; ya know that adrenaline pumping,scary feeling. I have taken it and sat at a table playing cards....the come up was alarming, and by getting up and walking, the bad feeling went away. Also, I&#039;m amazed out how lucid I generally am on this stuff, like I am not confused and can still function in this reality quite well. This slopes down quickly though with dosage increase.

				It was not at all like acid like I had been told. It was kind of like a stimulant psychedelic. Raised my body temp and made me feel hot, something that acid doesn&#039;t do for me at all.

I have taken it and sat at a table playing cards....the come up was alarming, and by getting up and walking, the bad feeling went away.

				Hey guys, I just ordered some 25i NBOMe and should come in 7-10 days, I&#039;m pretty stoked! Never tried any other psychedelics aside from DMT though, thats right, never tried LSD, shrooms or any RC&#039;s...<br /><br />Considering the amount you can buy for a cheap price compared to LSD! i know that its risky if you take too much and theres the risk of overdosing, but i&#039;m getting 25 blotters so it should last me 6-8 weeks hopefully! <br /><br />Instead of buying 2 LSD tabs why not 25&nbsp; 25i NBOMe&#039;s right? (to be cost effective until i get my pay)<br />Not to mention I&#039;ve got some ecstasy pills coming tomorrow or these couple of days, should keep me busy until i get the NBOMe&#039;s :D<br /><br />Silkroad is a bloody heaven! haha

				First post!<br /><br />Just tried a tab the other night from T5. I had never done a psych before in my life so have nothing much to compare it to but for a drug virgin I can describe it as being drunk off a six-pack but with the difference that you can still think fairly clearly and hold a conversation (but difficult to focus on tasks). The visuals off this 1000mg tab consisted of colors swirling in a predictable rhythm that was very interesting. I took a bath and stared at a sponge and it was like it was alive - yes it does make things look like they&#039;re breathing. Watched a couple of Futurama episodes and was able to follow it along and find it more funny than normal. Music sounded great but not really distorted or anything. <br /><br />Only negatives were nausea (I hadn&#039;t eaten for like 10 hours prior so didn&#039;t throw up), I had pretty bad jaw clenching and think I chewed on my cheek which really sucked and the spot on my upper gum where I held the tab got sore. By the way, the upper lip is better than sublingually since you can swallow your saliva normally and very little funny taste since the saliva up there doesn&#039;t circulate much.<br /><br />For the encore I was thinking of doing another tab along with 20mg of 2c-E. Since both act on the 5-HT2A receptor is this kinda dumb? Like doubling up basically? Would like to hear opinions about this combo.<br /><br />Gotta say that if it wasn&#039;t for SR I would never have done drugs... I don&#039;t have friends who do do drugs and I&#039;m out of school already so this is a godsend!

				Now I have a question about the &quot;dangers&quot; of 25i.<br /><br />Not much research has been done on this chem, that I know but can&#039;t we deduce things about the chem?<br /><br />When you ask or search anything about 25i all you get is &quot;No research No research No research&quot;. It is true that there is extremely little research but someone more scientifically versed than me has to be able to say &quot;well it agonizes the 5-HT4A receptor, this means something to me&quot;. I have no clue.<br /><br />Another thing is a negative trip I had the other day. I took 2mg sublingually and it was awful. It was like the other time I took it two days apart from the last trip and I obviously had no serotonin left because it was literally just 6 hours of discomfort and the comedown was the most fun part. It felt like cannabis but much more prevalent in my mind than cannabis.<br /><br />I want to know how I can stop this from happening again, here are some details which I think may have affected the trip.<br /><br />I tried it without vaporizing cannabis but the discomfort was so awful so I decided to vape and helped with the discomfort and sort of felt like it turned my trip &quot;on&quot;.<br /><br />I was very low on food, I hadn&#039;t eaten since the previous day at 2PM and I dropped the tabs at 10am the next day. I did not eat until that night due to my lack of appetite on 25i even though food tastes good.<br /><br />Anyways that threw me into another though, food is fucking delicious on 25i but I never have the appetite to eat it. I will eat like 4 chips and feel totally full but the four chips will taste amazing.

				I think im done with 25i ,sadly.<br />Ive had 12 amazing trips but the last three have been really unpleasant,with all the negatives and little positives. <br />. All of them gave me horrible chest tension. This chest tension is scary, its like its literally attacking my heart ,it feels like. 25i is in the amphetamine family, so its no surprise that it can cause tension and racy feelings. <br />To me, this is&nbsp; not a good thing. Chest tension is not good. Is this hurting my heart?<br />Is the squeezing in the chest meaning that parts of my heart is dying?&nbsp; My last three trips, even after a week off, have resulted in no euphoria,just racy feelings,chest tension. Its as if this chem is saying, &quot;you had your fun,now go!&quot; ...I don&#039;t know what to say. I had so much faith in this chem. and i have never felt such amazing euphoria from anything else ,except LSD. man, which leads me to that: LSD is the shit. It does not bail on you, always brings something to teach/experience, and it has very safe profile. Also with acid, the afterglow from a dedicated dose stays with me for a month. So one trip a month on acid is all I need to be blissed out 24/7. <br />So sorry nbome, sniff sniff, but gonna have to say goodbye :(<br />Lucy...where art thou?

				LSD or 25-I ?<br /><br />Well most of my 25i-lovers friends told me they prefer 25i over good old Lucy because they aren&#039;t &quot;mind twisted&quot; with it like with lsd or mushs. <br />IMO the ability of psychedelics to recall old memories and things you didn&#039;t think enough about to blew them in your mind and give you the opportunity to enlighten, or at the very least to progress in your apprehension of yourself and of the world, is the MAIN REASON why I prefer psychedelics over any other psychotropic substances&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />But in what they told me, being in an euphoric, colorful state of mind without you thinking at the speed of light 8 hours long is a quite funnier experience !<br /><br />So I&#039;d guess it depends on what you&#039;re waiting for :P

				25i-NBOMe was my first psychadelic. I thought it was amazing at the time. After doing LSD, DMT, AMT, 4-Aco-DMT, 5-MeO-DALT though; I wouldn&#039;t go near 25i again. In hindsight the blackouts and chest tension (among other general unhealthy effects) that I felt completely outweigh the fact that it&#039;s found relatively cheap.

				Thank you for the input, I think i will just hold off until tomorrow.&nbsp; Wake up and get my morning going and drop just a half to see what the effects are.&nbsp; I have never in my life tripped during the day.&nbsp; Even at music festivals, well I have only been to 2 in my entire life.&nbsp; Drank during the day and then rolled.&nbsp; I know a decent amount of substances but until I recently joined this family, I never knew there were so many.&nbsp; So now its just enjoy life and enjoy what I am able to get.&nbsp; Have been looking for a job for quite some time too and havent found one.&nbsp; Ehhhhhh this world will hopefully get better for me
