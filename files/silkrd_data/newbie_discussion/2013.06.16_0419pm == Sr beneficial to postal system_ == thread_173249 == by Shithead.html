				if it werent for the millions of packages being shipped for sr then yes the postal service would have gone belly&nbsp; up. thats probably why theres no urgency to stop packages from getting thru customs. ok probably not but lets face it the added revenue to usps definitly isnt hurting there bottom line.

				Not at a noticeable scale after all if SR (or drugs in general) started accounting for a large amount of post there would be calls from the straight edge assholes to do something drastic about it.

				It gives them business that&#039;s for sure. But I would still thing it accounts for only a smaller percentage of all mail. Heck usps may very well be losing money on every package they handle.<br /><br />The flip side is governments are weird. They&#039;ll spend tons of money fighting it, when, if they would simply put guidelines in place, they too would make money from it.

				Prohibition is the way it is thought, those in power and those employed in all the systems related to it (prison staff, police, lawyers etc) don&#039;t really want it to change and then neither do the drug cartels who make a ton of money off of it.

				I&#039;m sure we all know that drugs have been mailed since possibly the mail system was invented.&nbsp; I remember hearing plenty of stories of people back in the 70&#039;s getting packages in the mail all the time.&nbsp; It is safe to assume that with the popularity of mail delivery drugs, the USPS has made plenty money being funded by the powers that be with the technology and man hours needed for the new war on mail
