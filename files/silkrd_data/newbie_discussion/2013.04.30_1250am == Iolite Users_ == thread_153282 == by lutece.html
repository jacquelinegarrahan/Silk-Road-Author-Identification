				I had an Iolite for a while but could never get a decent high from it. I would let it steep for a bit, sip slowly, get loads of vapor but never a good high. <br /><br />Did anyone else have a similar or better experience with one?

				Jealous, I bought the iolite because it was easy to hide and ran off butane instead of batteries/power. But I haven&#039;t used it in forever, I gave it plenty of chances but it could never do it for me.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				I owned one, then sold it. Glass is just much better IMO. If you are going to vape get something worth vaping with. I bought this great vape device for oils and concentrate (doesn&#039;t work well with bud), called Eclipse. It&#039;s metal but you put your product in these glass vials and heat em up. It&#039;s rather nice for oils. Sorry that diddn&#039;t really answer your question but I thought I&#039;d mention it. You&nbsp; could always buy a vaporizor that&#039;s better than an iolite. I just feel like they are cheaply made and sometimes they don&#039;t even light.

I&#039;ve heard of the Eclipse, I&#039;ve only smoked bud as I keep my tolerance pretty low most of the time. I thought vaping would be a good idea but I just haven&#039;t had good luck so I&#039;ll probably just stick with combustion. <br /><br />And @bigjinx, I&#039;ll have to pass but thanks!

				I highly recommend the Arizer Solo, haven&#039;t combusted for months now. Glass stem directly into the oven, not very portable but tastes fantastic. Heat levels 1 - 7 vaporize to your needs, lower heat level (4) for THC and higher heat level (7) for CBD&#039;s. I use it for everything: buds, wax, oil, and even hash. Got it for $160 using an online coupon, but might be cheaper now.

				Have to agree with the Arizer Solo being my favorite portable vaporizer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes MFLB is more stealthy perhaps but I&#039;ve been able to take my SOLO most anywhere I would like to use one.&nbsp; &nbsp;Upgrade with some custom made stems by planetvape and the little unit hits big time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tasty hits from the all glass path too.&nbsp; &nbsp;
