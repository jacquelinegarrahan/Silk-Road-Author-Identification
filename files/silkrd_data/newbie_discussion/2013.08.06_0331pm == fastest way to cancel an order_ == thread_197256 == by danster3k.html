				if the order is still in the &quot;processing&quot; stage you can still hit the cancel button. <br /><br />otherwise, try messaging the seller with the order number and hope that it hasn&#039;t been shipped yet. Maybe you guys can work something out?<br /><br />If all else fails, just buy more bitcoins?

				the order is still set as &quot;processing&quot; but the cancel on the right isn&#039;t activated... i believe it only activates after 4 days.... i messaged seller yesterday, but no reply yet :( very frustrating, should really allow me to cancel immediately in case of an error, specially since the seller hasn&#039;t even reviewed it. <br /><br />i would buy more btc, but between bank transfer and waiting i wouldn&#039;t get it into my sr account until next week (i use mtgox, which is slower every time i use it). and want to order tonight, in hope of it arriving for saturday.<br /><br />does any one know of an instant way to buy btc? need to get the btc into my account today if i want to make an order for this weekend! <br /><br />if not, oh well, c&#039;est la vie!

				Right you can&#039;t cancel the order unless it is still &#039;processing&#039; after four days.<br /><br />You&#039;d have to ask the vendor to cancel the order if you want it cancelled before then.<br /><br />The time delay in part helps protect vendors. The vendor might have your order packaged and ready to ship, but not update the status to &#039;in transit&#039; until after it has actually been dropped. It would suck for the vendor to have shipped it, then when going to mark it in transit, the buyer had cancelled the order.

However it&#039;s an extra step in the workflow then for vendors. Then each order they have one additional step to perform. It might not seem like a lot but if the vendor gets a lot of orders it could add up timewise. I guess the moral on SR is don&#039;t place any order you can&#039;t afford to wait 4 days to cancel if necessary.

				The one i use frequently is cash deposit. find offers that say Boa, wells fargo, chase, etc, and set up a trade with them. You&#039;ll have 90 minutes to go to the bank and fill out a deposit slip for however much money/btc you agreed upon in the trade, and hand the deposit slip and the cash to the teller. Mark the payment complete on the site and the trade partner will release the bitcoins to you :)

				bank transfers here in spain take 2-4 days if they are from different banks, and 1 day if its within same bank.<br />That&#039;s why it always takes me over 6 days to get my cash into mt.gox.&nbsp; :(<br />

				so it took overnight to validate my account, because apparently the files i upload last night in the registration process were corrupt, so i had an email waiting this morning asking that i email in the scanned images of my id card. They then activated it within an hour and i made my first purchase of 0.5 btc, which took 2-3hours to reach my wallet (had to confirm and validate an sms, etc). Now just waiting for it to enter my sr account! woo!!! <br />Very fast indeed, much better than mt.gox, although 10% more expensive.
