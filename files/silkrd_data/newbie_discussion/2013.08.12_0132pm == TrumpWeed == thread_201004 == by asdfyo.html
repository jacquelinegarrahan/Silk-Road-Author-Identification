				thats what i was thinking, there also seems to be a lot of inconsistency with the strains they claim to have between the listings, profile page and what hes said they have in emails, claims low-pricing is due to having a really large grow facility, no mention of FE anywhere so hard to be a scam, the I&#039;m tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt and order, if it is straight from the factory as they claim then that pricing isn&#039;t too good to be true, QPs cost like $500 Canadian in BC so factor in silk road fees you&#039;re talking $550-$600 which is what Trumps weed is going at.

				something fishy going on, although i don&#039;t see why you would set up a vendor account, get some good feedback and not require FE then just vanish

				New vendor named 007weed showed up right around the same time trump&#039;s page went down.&nbsp; Not trying to preemptively bash a new vendor, but his prices and writing style seem pretty similar to trump.

				hes definitely not a scammer. i ordered an oz to sample from him and it came through after today. its some incredible product. once i find out if he has a new vendor account ill put up a review with hi-res pics and the likes. anyone have advice as to whether i should release the funds from escrow? im afraid that the coin will then go to his banned wallet and it will be irretrievable.

				Ive also heard his new acct is 007Weed. im hoping 007Weed is for real. Ive sent 3 messages so far with no reply even though it shows he read them. i can understand he is busy. Im looking forward to a fruitful business relationship with him if i can get a conversation going. I want to order some of his lb. listings.
