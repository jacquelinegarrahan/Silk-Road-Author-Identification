				Hey guys.<br /><br />&nbsp;So I know that weed is a cash cow but being a grower may be hard (due to the electricity involved).<br /><br />Meth seems too dangerous for me due to me forgetting a crucial step and fucking vaporizing myself into oblivion.<br /><br />What other reasonable options do I have? I trust you guys could tell me what&#039;s best for this.

				As an answer I guess I would ask which drug is the most challenging to manufacture?&nbsp; LSD is certainly up there, and one full dose is so, so small that the profit %s have to be outrageous.&nbsp; But my roomates in college were chemists, and so I know you can&#039;t just whip up lsd with a big brain and over the counter chemicals.&nbsp; It&#039;s really too bad, because psychedelics are such a special thing.&nbsp; It&#039;s tragic that lsd can be so easily controlled.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m pretty sure shrooms are a cash cow and require very little upfront costs. Plus shroom spores are for sale on here.

				Once you understand how to do it, shrooms are easy and actually quite fun to grow.&nbsp; Chemistry is a pretty big commitment if you don&#039;t have the background knowledge to start off with.&nbsp; Selling on SR will leave you with a lot more options (there&#039;s a demand for almost everything) but if you are selling face-to-face it&#039;d be best to pay attention to the market in your area.&nbsp;

				I would have to say that you might want to look into DMT, its extracted from root bark that is available online everywhere including here.<br />Uses less dangerous solvents than meth. Crystallization would not be the easiest thing to jump into in a hurry..<br /><br />But with all things knowledge is the key,<br />And practice makes perfect(though perfection is impossible so this parts abit false) but it does make damn good results&nbsp; <br /><br />Shrooms are a great thing to cultivate but it takes a very sterile enviroment that you must be able to maintain that way so you don&#039;t lose any batches

				Growing weed becomes progressively cheaper, but there&#039;s some overhead involved when you&#039;re a noob, especially if you want to grow good stuff. Growing shrooms sounds like it might be good money.

				DMT can be very profitable, but it really isn&#039;t a well known drug at all so unless you know a lot of people interested in psychedelics then it might be hard to sell enough of it to be really worth your time. Unless you plan to sell it on Silk Road, in which case it might take you a while to be able to extract it to a high enough standard to be able to compete with existing vendors. Might be worth looking into though
