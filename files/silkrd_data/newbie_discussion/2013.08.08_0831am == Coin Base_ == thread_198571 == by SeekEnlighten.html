				Does anyone have any experience using coinbase? This seems like one of the easiest services to use to purchase bitcoins online. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s 100% legit though does anyone know? Im just sketching about my bank info and all that. Thanks in advance.

				Damn wtf 7 days! That sucks...<br />Thanks for the advice, much appreciated! Which program would you suggest for tumbling my bitcoins before they get to SR? Also is there another service I can use to buy bitcoins online that doesnt take 7 days to process?

				i don&#039;t have a whole lot of experience yet, still quite new, but you might try local bitcoins - they put buyers in contact with sellers, and they have an escrow system. only reason i didn&#039;t use them is i live in the boondocks so no close sellers. also a quick forum search will probably turn up a list of other options

				Coinbase looks legit; they probably are registered as a MSB else they&#039;d have been shut down already. The only thing that worries me about them is there are quite a few threads on here of people praising them as a source for BTC. Just thinking that might draw undue attention to them.

				They are one of the most legit. The only draw back is that it takes like a week to get coin until you get like level 2 verification or something, then i believe it&#039;s instant, but don&#039;t quote me on that. and you definitely want to tumble the coin through a few wallets before reaching SR. Personally, I prefer localbitcoins

				Like everyone else says. A legit site but it does take a week to get your coinage. It&#039;s typically 4 business days or so so a weekend order can be available by Friday. <br /><br />Localbitcoins seems like a way to go. I need to look into it.

				Cool thanks for the help. I was looking at localbitcoin but I feel like I can get scammed by that. Is there any wait for localbitcoins? Also I checked it out and it seems you can only buy in quantities of 1 bitcoin and you cant get less then that is that true?<br /><br />Yea localbitcoins might be the method I choose I just need to learn more as well.
