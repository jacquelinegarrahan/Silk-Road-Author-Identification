				I used it to get my first coins, but I&#039;d generally discourage using it. <br />You buy &quot;SLL&quot; (second life dollars) and convert them into BTC, paying fees through each exchange.&nbsp; I somehow ended up with 75% of the money I spent in Bitcoins. <br />My recommendation is to use a site like localbitcoins and find someone who will do a western union transfer or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Virwox is &quot;reputable&quot; (you&#039;ll get your coins), but the fees are just silly.

				Virwox is utter and complete SHIT.<br /><br />The fees are WAY to high.I&#039;m saying ridiculous high.<br />No fractals so you will not get the perfect amount you want either.<br /><br />Go with localbitcoins.<br />To me there is nothing better.

				I used them last night to buy some bitcoins. Started out with 20 dollars and ended up with 17 in bitcoins. The fees are high am I am still waiting to see them post in my SR acct.<br /><br />I would love to use localbitcoins but have not found one to work yet.

				First two times I used them they were great, last time it took 14 days to get my coins!<br /><br />The last time I used them was about 2 months ago, so maybe they have stepped their game up lately.

				14 Days is crazy. I am coming up on 24 hours now and the site states up to 48.<br /><br />They said something about a manual check. Anyone know what that is about?
