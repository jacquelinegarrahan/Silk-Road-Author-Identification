				== Pure LSA Extraction, Visually Active with no Nausea or Bodyload ==<br /><br />=== Procedure ===<br /><br />Procedure Main: Clean Liquid LSA Extract<br /><br />1)Pulverize your seeds into a powder using a coffee grinder or your method of choice.<br /><br />2)Thoroughly mix in a glass the seed powder and 100 ml of acetone. Mix frequently for 2-3 hrs, the more mixing the better.<br /><br />3)After this, filter solution and set aside acetone extract in a glass and cover with plastic wrap to prevent early evaporation. Put seed mush back into the original cup and cover with 100 ml new acetone.<br /><br />4)Repeat steps 3-4 two more times so you have atleast 3 extractions (can do more if desired). . After third extraction, discard seed mush and combine the extracts into an evaporation dish/bowl. Set up a fan blowing on the extraction to speed evaporation. Doesn&#039;t take too long. Evap to dryness, making sure there is no more acetone smell.<br /><br />5)Mix in a glass 100 ml distilled water and a pinch of citric acid (pH 3-5). Add to the dry crude LSA extract and mix well for 10 minutes. Not everything will dissolve. Filter out the solids. There should now be 100 ml of aqueous LSA citrate.<br /><br />6)Defat this solution with 50 ml naptha, mixing well for 10 minutes. Seperate layers with a 10 ml syringe and discard naptha. Repeat. Make sure the second time that there is no remaining naptha floating in your LSA extract after defat.<br /><br />7)Now its time to freebase the LSA so it can be extracted from the water layer. Add a small amount of ammonia (around 1 ml) to solution until it changes to a light yellow color. PH should be roughly 9-10.<br /><br />8]Quickly add 50 ml toluene or DCM to the solution and mix well for 15-20 minutes. After, seperate the layers with syringe and set aside the 50 ml of toluene or DCM in a glass. Repeat this step 1 or 2 more times depending on how scrupulous you want to be. Afterwards, discard your yellow/green water layer. <br /><br />9)Now with your combined toluene or DCM extracts, set them to evaporate in an evaporation dish/bowl with the aid of a fan. This again shouldnt take too long, and you end up with a pure white crystal residue once dry. This could be consumed, but will oxidize pretty quickly over a few days if left out of solution.<br /><br />10)Once your pure extract is dry and there is absolutely no smell of solvent in your evap dish, add 10 ml distilled H2O and 5 ml 75% drinkable ethanol. Sprinkle in a pinch of tartaric acid and mix thoroughly for 10 minutes. Filter this, and store in a vial away from heat and light. <br /><br /><br />==== Comments ====<br />This product of clean liquid LSA extract glows bright blue under black light and &#039;&#039;&#039;MUST BE COMBINED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF PEPPERMINT OIL&#039;&#039;&#039; 20 minutes before consuming for an amazing psychedlic experience. If solution turns milky after peppermint oil addition, add a little alcohol to increase solubility. Inferior extraction recipes can leave you with stomach cramps and vasoconstriction, not to mention nausea, and the effects may not even be very impressive. A pure clean LSA extraction using this tek however... Absolutely no nausea or bodyload. It is a euphoric dreamy feeling psychedelic similar but different than LSD lasting about 6-10hrs, and can produce visuals made up of colors, vibrant pulsing tracers, flashy looking stars and symbols, and intricate geometric patterns. Good luck to all and I hope this tek creates many memorable experiences.<br /><br />===Materials_list===<br /><br />* 100 HBWR seeds Hawaiian Strain. Never buy Ghana strain. (Morning Glory seeds may be substituted in as well)<br />|<br />* 300 ml acetone.<br />* 110 ml distilled H2O.<br />* 100 ml naptha.<br />* 100 ml toluene or DCM.<br />* 5 ml drinkable ethanol (everclear works well).<br />|<br />* 1 pinch citric acid.<br />* 1 ml ammonia.<br />* 1 pinch tartaric acid.<br />|<br />* Coffee filters and funnel.<br />* Evaporating dish/bowl.<br />* Syringe 10 ml.<br />* Stir stick.<br />* Glassware.<br />* Vial 15ml or more (preferably amberglass).<br />-All materials contained in this list can be found at hardware store, grocery store, or online by every-day consumers.<br /><br /><br />=== Dosage Information ===<br />LSA is a mid-duration psychedelic entheogen that lasts about 6-10 hours. The experience varies greatly on how the entheogen is consumed whether it is in the form of raw seeds or extracted. The exact nature of the LSA experience is debated, as experiences vary with each person. LSA tends to produce a dreamlike state with mild to significant visions and can be accompanied by euphoria, sedation, nausea, and vasoconstriction. Raw LSA containing seeds tend to bring on much more of the side-effects than cleaned extracts. Peppermint oil is often combined with LSA extracts leading to a more positive experience, though the exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unknown. Some believe it to be the formation of LSH, an unstable lysergic compound more closely resembling LSD, though this topic is hotly disputed. <br />It is difficult to accurately measure doses of LSA extract, since potency can vary. In general you can get a rough idea by comparing the ratio of seeds to liquid extract volume. A small amount of peppermint oil should be added to the LSA extract 20 minutes prior to consuming. While dosages vary for everyone, I believe this to be a fairly accurate scale of dosage for the extraction procedure:<br /><br />* &#039;&#039;&#039;Threshold&#039;&#039;&#039; &lt; 10 seeds worth <br />* &#039;&#039;&#039;Light&#039;&#039;&#039; 10-19 seeds worth <br />* &#039;&#039;&#039;Common&#039;&#039;&#039; 20-34 seeds worth <br />* &#039;&#039;&#039;Strong&#039;&#039;&#039; 35-50 seeds worth <br />* &#039;&#039;&#039;Heavy&#039;&#039;&#039; &gt; 50 seeds worth
