				Hi Silk Road users,<br /><br />I came cross a company that is somewhat large in my opinion.&nbsp; They have over 3,500+ employees worldwide.&nbsp; They use ADP to handle their payroll.&nbsp; My question for you is.&nbsp; What is the User/Password to the master account that changes all the passwords to all the users on ADP for that company worth?&nbsp; The company is worth billions.&nbsp; Their password management is extremely relaxed...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What is it worth?&nbsp; 1 bitcoin? 5 bitcoins? 10 bitcoins? 100 bitcoins? 350 bitcoins? or more?

				As a genuine question, what makes you think someone would want this? Like what could someone do with this information? Thanks&nbsp; :)

				You mean you can steal billions from that company just like that? Or what exactly can you do with it? I&#039;m sure a rival corporation would be very interested in that either way.

				Change all the direct deposits to go over to offshore bank of that given payroll period. Also for this deal. The buyer would be given the IP addresses to all servers with user/passwords to the admin control of those systems.&nbsp; Security is to relaxed and they&#039;ve been warned multiple times to make security better.
