				PB. it was him who suggested that some had mentioned slow delivery times.<br /><br />as mentioned i&#039;ve used him before and packaging/product has always been spot on, just taking longer than usual.starting to think whether its been lost or stolen in the post and whether to send out another package to this address.ive got some legit packages coming soon so was going to see if they were tampered with.<br /><br />i think im being overly paranoid or stoned lol.

				After confirming with Neon Lights if I ordered that Wed he&#039;d be able to send it out Thu so I could get it Fri - it was 5 x PartyFlock MDMA pills. Even if he was late sending it say.. off cut off time even on Fri I would&#039;ve got them today for sure, all in all not pleased and very glad I haven&#039;t FE&#039;d. He has logged in, the least he could do was refund me or offer an explanation if theres a delay. I explained to him it was my first attempt at buying and he seemed understanding, just strange the way its worked out.<br /><br />Shame too, really wanted to try the party flocks.

				It amazes me with PB, that everything comes through as easily as it does. To me, it seems his product would be the most susceptible to ... well, I guess seepage.<br /><br />As for NL, in case you haven&#039;t seen other threads, NL is no longer with us and will not be fulfilling any orders. A genuine blow to the Australian domestic market.

				I&#039;ve only ordered from PB once (used to be a heavy smoker, gave it up a couple of years ago -- picked some up for an event this weekend though), and it was amazingly well packaged. I did exactly the same as you -- sniffed outside, inside, and then when I ripped open the packet BAM! right in my face hahaha PB seems very professional in his packaging, he doesn&#039;t seem to do it while high -- well, I hope not! last thing you want is a tiny pin hole, or where a part isn&#039;t sealed properly and over time a familiar smell begins to waft out of the packet ... one that a doggy would no doubt be able to pick up straight away!<br /><br />but of course, that&#039;s the sort of thing I think of when I forget to take my tin foil hat off!<br /><br />Haven&#039;t dealt with TWM yet, although I intend to in the future -- looks like the only AU Domestic vendor at the moment with MDMA! You rate him and the quality of his product?
