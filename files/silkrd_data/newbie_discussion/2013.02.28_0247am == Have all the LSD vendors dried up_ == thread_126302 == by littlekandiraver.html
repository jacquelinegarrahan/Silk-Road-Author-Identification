				Last newbie post! I&#039;m about to hit 50!<br /><br />But I was checking out the LSD section and it seems like everything is either lotteries or (seemingly) over priced tabs. Have some of the vendors dried up? <br />Are any of the few on SR right now worth the time?

				Check out &#039;The Avengers LSD Vendors...&#039; thread. The first page shows which vendors are recommended and which aren&#039;t as well as who is in stock. Jannis, tesselated and gammagoblin (FE for new users) are all looking promising from the research I&#039;ve done. In my opinion there are ample quality suppliers of lucy at the moment.

				You in USA?&nbsp; I&#039;m in the same boat, wish I could get ahold of some L but I really don&#039;t want to order int&#039;l.&nbsp; I was actually set to go in for a vial from jesusofrave (UK) as he claims to have a 100% success rate on shipping, but he ran into delays and then paranoia changed my mind.&nbsp; I hope some domestic vendors get ahold of some.

				I&#039;ve had a bit of experience with the 2C family and have found it be really really fun but not as spiritually fulfilling as acid or mushrooms. Maybe it&#039;s the natural/semi-natural background or the culture that surrounds them but 2c experiences have a kind of synthetic feel to them. My first ever order was international and I&#039;ve been ordering int ever since. If you&#039;re feeling paranoid just start low and make sure you contact the seller and find out how successful they&#039;ve been in shipping to the US.

				I&#039;m not about to tell anyone they should go international if they&#039;re not comfortable with it, but I will note that there&#039;s nothing easier to conceal than tabs. When you read a &quot;I almost threw out that mail&quot; story, it&#039;s usually (though not always) tabs.<br /><br />The aforementioned Avengers thread will tell you who the star vendors are, wherever they may be.

				I would try tesselated It got shipped from Canada and it made it to me in the States and I must say the shipping was amazing if I didnt ask where it was hidden I wouldnt of found it, Now I got some of the bad batch which is explained in the review thread about what happened but Im getting new stuff which I should be expecting anyday now free of charge, really a great vendor.

				From what I hear Tessellated seems like the way to go right now. His tabs are a bit pricey but customer service seems solid. I would avoid Lucydrop until we see how things unfold with the recent events.

				I think I mixed 2c-i and 2c-b up. I&#039;ve always been told 2c-b was bad and have overdose cases. I&#039;ve been doing some research and apparently 2c-b is similar to mdma? Would anyone give me opinions on using it? <br /><br />I&#039;ve never cared for LucyDrop and I&#039;ve heard the rumormill about him/her. <br /><br />Also, I just want to thank everyone for helping me out and giving me advice.

				It&#039;s the nbomes that are dangerous due to the tiny microgram doses. I&#039;ve been sample a very small amount of 2CB just now and though it was mixed with a few other things i&#039;d say it&#039;s probably a bit of a mix between mdma and mescaline. Definitely check out erowid.org before you try anything for the first time.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb.shtml

				I would go with Tessellated. I ordered from them with zero problems. I was kind of nervous about ordering internationally (I&#039;m in the US), but his stealth is fantastic. Though I will say the tabs were sort of weak. I really think they may have been unevenly laid, because they normally get great feedback. But because of the weak trip my friends and I had I decided to order from LucyDrop next. I put in an order for their 50 tabs and it&#039;s been over 2 weeks now and it hasn&#039;t arrived. Pretty sad, I haven&#039;t tripped in a couple months and was really looking forward to it. If my tabs don&#039;t ever get here from LD, I&#039;ll be giving Tess another go.

				Oh, also I&#039;ve done 25i NBOMBe. Not a good experience. I felt slightly ill the entire trip. I had major constriction of my blood vessels to the point of my limbs tingling. This was on a small dose, too. I did trip and I had a few memorable experiences that were sort of fun, but it wasn&#039;t worth it for the sickness. Kind of sucks cause I have more tabs in my fridge but no one I know wants them now, ha. Sometimes I wonder if I would have done another tab or two if I would have come up better and got above the sickness, but I&#039;m not really dying to do that to myself again.

				I was actually very nervous to place my first international order too, but after reading about how stealth tessellated is, it called my nerves and I decided to place my order a couple days ago. hopefully all goes well because I can&#039;t wait to test the product.

				Yeah, I have no hesitation ordering internationally from Tessellated. The stealth really was so good your bigger danger would be not being able to find it yourself, rather than someone else finding it.<br /><br />And I thought the claim of 200ug was entirely believable - these are strong tabs. One was enough for a full day spent wandering through gloriously colorful, empathetic nature, with a great warm euphoria, as well as intense fascination. Within half an hour I was seeing early visual alerts, and it just took off from there, prompting my friend and I to start walking and exploring for hours. It felt entirely clean and happy, with no body load. I&#039;m eager to try two next time - though maybe not in too far-flung outdoor places, as I have a feeling it could be intense.
