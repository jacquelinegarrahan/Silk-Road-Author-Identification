				A friend mailed me some medication 5 days ago from the same state. It&#039;s some opioid maintenance meds that I can&#039;t afford to go to a Dr. and get legit. It usually takes 1-2 days for these packages to make it to me. With all that&#039;s going on with SR I&#039;ve started to worry a bit. I finally got the tracking from my friend today, and it says that a notice was left a few days ago at my address. It says that it&#039;s a certified letter, but he says he asked for first class. And he can&#039;t remember if he said yes to signature required. Should I let it go? I&#039;m in withdrawals pretty bad right now, and this medicine would help me so much.

				if this is a serious question between you asking <br /><br />- go get it and risk getting caught by The Man? <br />or<br />- don&#039;t go get it and live through wd, lose your meds?<br /><br />I would want to know if you have criminal record/bad rep with The Man, and perhaps also what&#039;s in the package and how much (vs. how badly you&#039;d be f***ed in case you were caught)?<br /><br />if it was me, I would base the judgement on &quot;jail time or not&quot;... as in, if you have a clean record, and did not order a SHIT TON of oxy, I would go pick it and if shit hits the fan, own up and ask for medical help (now, I am not from USA... so do pardon me is &quot;asking for medical help&quot; sounds like a joke where you&#039;re at). <br /><br />toughie.<br /><br />...sorry I can&#039;t really help more than maybe talk to you/help you ponder... :)

				If you really need it and you will possibly hurt yourself from wd , go get it. If you feel in your gut its not safe, just dont go get it and hope your friend will work with you to get more of what you need. It sucks they dont know if they said signature required. If it was a package it shouldnt be certified mail. If it was a letter mailer, i wouldn&#039;t go get it.
