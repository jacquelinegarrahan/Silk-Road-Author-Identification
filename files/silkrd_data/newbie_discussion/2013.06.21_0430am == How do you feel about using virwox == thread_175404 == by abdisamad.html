				well I just started using them this week, so I can&#039;t be sure of them.&nbsp; I know that when you add money you have to convert it to SLL then to BTC, since my account was new they said it will take around 48 hours to send the btc to my desired address.&nbsp; I just did it today so I can update you if it was a success or not in a day or so.

				i&#039;ve used virwox a few times... the fees are hideous. when 1 BTC was worth $130, which was also the max i could deposit at once at the time, i deposited the full $130... and after fees, and exchanging USD for SLL, then SLL for BTC, what i got was 0.84 of a bitcoin. i felt pretty ripped off; they took about $34 in fees.<br /><br />i&#039;ve also used coinbase and bitinstant... i like coinbase best when i have time to wait for the price of the BTC to go down, it&#039;s a pain having to wait 5-7 days for my damn coin. if you want instant coins, i&#039;d go with bitinstant over virwox, just to skirt the damned fees...
