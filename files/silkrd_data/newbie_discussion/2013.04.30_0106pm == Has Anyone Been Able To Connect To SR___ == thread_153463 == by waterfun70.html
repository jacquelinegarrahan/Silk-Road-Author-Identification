				The Site is down at the moment...... <br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting time, I was here last November when the shit hit the fan....<br /><br />I have faith in DPR, but it seems he&#039;s facing the most challenging problem to date. Speaking for myself, I hate the idea of a world without SR - but am willing to accept this might be the case. I have always been forward thinking with my drug buying habits, not one for the 11:00 PM Friday night call (I would always organise what I needed in advance).<br /><br />I think that&#039;s the real problem with people losing their shit when SR goes down, it&#039;s created a platform where we can get anything we want and we pretty much know the quality of the product will be substantially better than using &#039;dealers&#039; IRL. <br /><br />I dunno, it&#039;s a case of wait and see I guess, it&#039;s a shame we don&#039;t live in a more &#039;free&#039; world.... Being on here for about 7 Months has been a massive privilege. I won&#039;t be happy if it ends, but it seems like everything it might..<br /><br />Just my 2 cents anyways......

				Thanks for the update! My last order of H was a &quot;no show&quot; and the vendor went AWOL, he even removed all of his product postings. I&#039;m hoping the resolve option of a refund went through as I&#039;m itching to place another order.

				users_dont_lose_drugs I agree with you 100%. I decided to check out Atlantis last night as a back up to SR. It was easy to connect to through the tor browser. It appears that they are still building their product offering, but plenty of stuff.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				Nothing today.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, this is likely the work of faceless State entities, or a well funded criminal group that is trying to hold SR (and DPR) hostage. Assuming the latter, I would be surprised if the instigators haven&#039;t requested some sort of payoff to cease the onslaught.<br /><br />Some group is putting a lot of time and energy in keeping this attack going.
