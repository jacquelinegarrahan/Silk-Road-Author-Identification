				Presuming it will be. The reason is i ordered a gram of coke from Holland which was intercepted by UK Border Agency. I received the package, which was empty and it was taped up with UK Border Agency tape saying it had been inspected.

				You should really check the customs proceedings for your country. But to me it sounds like it was intercepted. As for being flagged, you really should check on custom proceeding, they probably have it online.<br /><br />If I&#039;m not mistaken for the US customs must intercept a certain amount of packages before launching an investigation. But I would imagine they keep a record of it in that case,meaning possible increased likely-hood for a more thorough check. Then again I have never gotten a customs letter, in any address in my almost 2 years on SR. But had I, I probably would use a different address just to be on the safe side.<br /><br />Hope that kinda helps. Hopefully someone from the UK will clarify the issue eventually.<br />Kind regards.&nbsp; :P

Certainly for international orders, at least. I know of people who have continued to receive domestic packages after having international packages seized, but that&#039;s a risk you&#039;ll have to weigh and then decide for yourself.

				1. Address burned.<br />2. If it was your home address, then clean house. Eliminate suspicions by having a home that is drug free. If you do recklessly choose to have drugs in your home, then they should be extremely hard to find and/or extremely small quantities. Federal/Imperial agents don&#039;t want to waste resources doing street cop-level busts. They want dangerous criminals, armed militias, terrorists, and mafioso. The less you match that, the better of your life will be.<br />3. Get a new address or STOP USING THE ROAD. If you continue with the burned address, then you deserve what comes to you--and no one deserves to be put in a cage. The Road has a very unique learning process. You have protect against &quot;ghosts&quot;, and you have to believe the ghosts are real... otherwise: prison.<br />4. Revisit #2. If it is truly a flagged address, then you might be on a permanent intelligence list. This is trivial in the lives of most people. I have had friends that were certainly on CIA lists... What it means for a regular Joe, is that iff you ever commit a heinous crime, then there is support against you if you take it to trial. It also means less leniency iff you do hire savvy legal protection. This is a complicated situation, and the best line of advice is to clean house and use clean addresses from here on out... maybe even avoid that vendor. Avoid ordering internationally. Domestic orders are exponentially safer if the vendor is reliable.<br /><br />Good Luck.

				Thanks for your thoughts. All taken on board. Going to check UK Border Force website.<br /><br />Dont keep drugs in the house or anywhere to be honest. Order 1 gram for personal and its gone same weekend.<br /><br />Will check house though just in case (empty baggies etc). <br /><br />Learned by my mistakes but never thought 1 gram in good stealth would get pulled. Bad luck I guess.<br /><br />Thanks again all.<br /><br />

It&#039;s been my experience before, ordering things that get shipped into and out of Holland can be sketchy. Holland mail is a very odd thing, with delivery statistics not as pleasant as one hopes for. There are regular disappearances on both ends of this delivery chain. So, yeah, some official--or regular employee--just had a party. 1 gram is not worth writing home about if you&#039;re a daily inspector, but it is a nice freebee.<br /><br />Best.

I see two scenarios, each associated with the following two examples. <br /><br />One: Address Flagged; Change of Scenery. Effects/Consequences: Obtain second address; adding a crime to your already-illegal lifestyle... your size in the sea just increased a pinch. Off shoots of this possibility could also lead to an amazing life of charity and dedication to one&#039;s own community... through narcotic syndication.<br /><br />Two: Remain Calm; All Systems Nominal. Effects/Consequences: Continue the life of the Road as (cas)usual. Stay out of trouble. Stay productive. No worries. Life goes on, and big fish lure patient anglers; and the other way around--sometimes the fish bite. It&#039;s all a matter of luck.<br /><br />We are living with ghosts, aren&#039;t we? Fictitious, sometimes malicious, demons in our lives, yet we ask not for the curse that living has given to us. Striving to survive is well worth dying for in the most noble, i.e. selfless, manner, and genetics demand of us our lives and repays its burdensome debt with mortality. Yet we think, we eat, we breathe, we act--consciously and unconsciously; immaterially and materially; spiritually and physically.<br /><br />Ghosts, that are both real and unreal, simultaneously conscious and unconscious, serve the greatest resource&nbsp; humanity usurps from nature. Ghosts generate a sense of anxiety and unease that causes us to act, if we believe there is incarceration or Capture Troopers awaiting inevitable mistakes. <br /><br />How can we avoid mistakes? <br /><br />There is no better response that I feel like think of: Practice Makes Perfect. There is a genetic alternative, but that option is still in the future. Imagine OCD as an option at gene therapy clinics. OCD is the natural drive that pushes us to the limits of memory and physical exhaustion. It is a brain clock that drives us to count, clean, think, and act in the world in an orderly manner. It is the answer to entropy, which has recently claimed our funds in the BTC market price. If you are a fan of the Ender series by Orson Scott Card, then you can appreciate the parallels with this highly repetitive and hypersanitary lifestyle and the mandatory lifestyle challenges that one faces with life on the Road.<br /><br />Get into the cycle of life without chaos. Join the future by expressing your OCD gene. Genetics change through time, according to conscious and unconscious environmental conditions. It is a system of feedback, and we are in control if we choose to be...<br /><br />Never stop learning.
