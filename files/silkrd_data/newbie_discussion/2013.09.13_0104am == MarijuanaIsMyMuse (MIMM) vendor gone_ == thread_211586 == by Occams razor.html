				I ordered some MDMA from MarijuanaIsMyMuse 4 days ago. My order is still processing and now today their profile page is gone. I am only able to send a message. <br /><br />Is this normal behavior for a vendor? What happened to their profile exactly? <br /><br />I am becoming suspicious and paranoid. I am definitely considering canceling my order. Thoughts, ideas?

I will research all vendors deeply moving forward. I will never forget this.<br /><br />I will check out megrimlock, thank you for the recommendation. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to risk this order with MIMM at this point, I will cancel my order and get some MDMA, 2C-B or GHB. The latter two I have never tried. Thoughts, suggestions?

This doesn&#039;t happen when they are in &quot;vacation&quot; mode, like, just taking a break. I&#039;ve seen it happen like 4 times to banned vendors, DubGx2, DaRuthless1,&nbsp; and a couple others I can&#039;t quite recall

				So MIMM is definitely confirmed scammer?<br /><br />There&#039;s another vendor in Canada called GoingPostal who&#039;s just appeared with similar listings to MIMM and using MIMM pictures. Are they related in some way?
