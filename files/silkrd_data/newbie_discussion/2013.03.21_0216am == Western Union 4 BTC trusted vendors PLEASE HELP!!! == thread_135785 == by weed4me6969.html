				bro, i just got fucking robbed by Duck Commander ALOT of money!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck WU 4 BTC.... just dont do it, i have heard people swear by Blue sky traders, but i have never personally ordered from them... just check out bitstamp, localbitcoins, any person to person site and you might have to sign up but whatever, use any info... on these such sites, you can get WU for BTC and with ESCROW, how cool is that!

				Check me out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just started my account and it sounds exactly like what you are looking for.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s a long shot because I am so new.&nbsp; But read my profile and/or follow me as a fan until I&#039;ve earned credibility, then maybe we can work in the future.&nbsp; Either way good luck finding what you need.<br /><br />I&#039;m a business man, I swear that I have only good intentions.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have coins, but I need cash.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9965df269c

				Hi guys <br />I am jumping in because my name is in the conversation. As you all know you can see my comments sections and you will see I only have 5&#039;s so that means I am a reliable source. I have not even one customer saying something bad about me and you can see there are many.

				localbitcoins is legit for fast transactions and is very safe and very reliable....also if you have a day or so to spare check out CampBx they are legit too....for vendors on SR....i use JumboMonkeyBiscuit and BTCking all the time extremely reliable and fast , these vendors are both extremely honest, respond to every message and aim to please....i have heard alot about MoneyHoney and here of late domesticdrops and financialfreedom ...obviously you need to do your research and localbitcoins is an awesome way to go but if you are in a pinch those are some solid vendors...i know you asked for WU transfer i only know of a few but the minimum is $800 so i mean for some people that is to much for them
