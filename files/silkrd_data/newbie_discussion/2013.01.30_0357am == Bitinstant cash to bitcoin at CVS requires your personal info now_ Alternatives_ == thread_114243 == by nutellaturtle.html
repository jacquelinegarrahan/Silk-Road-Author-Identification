				This is not my first time buying bitcoins however it seems there is always something new to deal with. Ive used bitinstant.com prior to this in the late summer and had provided them with the name and new email i had created based off a legitimate ID that i had found. However, i never had to provide a phone number. Now not only does bitinstants deposit service (ZipZap) require your phone number, but so does the moneygram service at CVS, aka the red phone. And now cash bank deposits which only required filling out a deposit slip with no personal information is no longer an option on bitinstant. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, my question is... Either does anyone know from personal experience whether the CVS monetgram option every verifies the phone number or personal info? Or... In the US is there any way that currently works to get bitcoins from cash deposit that does not require personal information?<br /><br />Im aware bitcoins are not illegal and i could use my real info and probably be fine, however maintaining anonymity is kind of the idea of this thing and im not that comfortable sending coins purchased in my name into a pool of coins used for an illicit drug market. So if anyone can help me out id really appreciate it.

				@bicman - I agree, ZipZap was retarded. The bitinstant website allows cash deposits of up to $999 however their second party bitcoin provider aka zipzap has a $500 limit per transaction and a $2,000 limit for each day so id be stuck making four deposits everyday for like four days to get all my coins in... and then wouldnt a red flag be raised by all the activity and might they want to verify the information by calling the phone number provided on the multiple moneygrams... i just dont want to go hand CVS my two grand with false info and phone # multiple days in a row (regardless of using different locations or not) and just hope every thing goes smoothly. If something goes wrong theyll have my money and no way to contact me. and if i use my real phone # i sacrifice my anonymity and everything ive done to protect it.

				find an anonymous alternative otherwise its all been for nothing.<br /><br />@bicman - Im interested in your experience with bitcopia for one. did they ever require any personal info, if so what? was your bitcoin purchase more than 500? and did you make multiple? also, did thay use a second party service similar to zipzap or did bitcopia handle all of the transaction?<br /><br />@kesser - thanks for the thread ill look into it now

				Buying bitcoins is legal guys... Giving your personal info shouldnt worry you. Bitcoins are &quot;tumbled&quot; when sent to silk road, and tehoreticly cant be traced.<br /><br />Zipzap moneygram people have been talkiing about seemed like a method I didnt want to do as well... Mainly cause I had to interact with people. I ended up using moneypak to btc on SR, and it worked great. But sense then I&#039;ve connected my debit card to coinbase.com, and am loving it. Minimal fees, but it does indeed take afew days for the bank transfew to go through (maybe a week). Assuming were not all living paycheck to paycheck it really shouldnt be a problem.<br /><br />Anywho, buying bitcoins is legal. Give them ur info at cvs... it dosent matter.

There was no secondary service and i paid no fees. I made one transaction between $500-$1000. They ask that you make the deposit within an hour of opening the request. By the time i got back to my house, 15-20 minutes, i had the coins in my wallet.<br />

				@bicman - wow sounds like a dream site... reading their FAQ its clear they dont give a fuck. and especially for someone like me who is trying to make many deposits ill only have to make half the amount of them with bitcopia as opposed to the CVS option with the 500 dollar limit and personal information requrement.
