				The latest review of 1/5 for starrynight<br /><br />received package today, 48 hours after it was shipped. good packaging, haven&#039;t checked for weight or quality yet but will update. overall good transaction 5/5<br />Edit: weight was good and delivery was swift packaging was stealth enough but left a little to be desired. Product was not at all what i expected for the price. Much lower quality product than i hoped for. 3/5<br />Additional edit: haven&#039;t hears from him in 3 days, trying to get a 50 percent refund because the bud i got did not match its description. very displeased with order. other peoples feed back say his bud is great and he claims it is similar to sour diesel. Maybe i just got a shitty batch.<br />Final edit: its been over a week and still nothing. hes logged in today so hes seen his messages and just won&#039;t answer them. horrible vendor would not do business with ever again, regrettable decision to do business with him in the first place<br /><br />Starrynight only sells orders of 1, 2, and 4g&#039;s of this weed. So your unhappy with only the quality on a small order like that and want 50% back OMFG. <br /><br />I need to teach these buyers a lesson again! Time to fire up Tony&#039;s Mart again!

				Quality control will always be an issue with drugs, even pharmaceuticals. Just because somebody else really likes a specific strain of weed does not mean that you will. Everybody reacts differently to the same chemicals. Gene expression leading to protein structure.<br /><br />Oh the joys of being a seller on SR.
