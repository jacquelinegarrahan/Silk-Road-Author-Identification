				There&#039;s been a lot in the news about how sickos are using the hidden internet to share CP images. The way things are going the next step will be calls for ISPs to start blocking TOR. I understand there have been calls for this to take place in Japan.<br /><br />Just wondering what other people think about this and how people would access SR if this took place ?

				I was under the impression that TOR was designed to not be blocked. The US navy helped fund it so people in Internet suppressed countries could still use it. That&#039;s why they are going after bitcoins instead of TOR and Silk Road. Ironic that Japan is against CP with lolicon and all.

				Where in the news my friend, have you got any links to any articles? I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if that was the argument they choose to support the closing of TOR; the masses will be easily swayed by an emotive subject like this.

				CP is childpr0n. ISP&#039;s can easily block tor, all they need to know are all the tor entry nodes and then block traffic to them. There are ways around that though.

				CP = Child Porn. Tor is not blocked. While it is blocked in some countries around the world such as China, for those of us living in the Western world, it&#039;s alive and running as per usual. Why are you posting this bullshit for?? Tor is only one of the anonymous networks available to users. Others besides Tor include I2P, Freenet and a host of others currently under development. Tor also has many legitimate uses besides those that are illegal and is not the one and only option of accessing CP on the Hidden Web. Shutting down Tor wouldn&#039;t block CP users. They would just switch networks.

				are you, perchance, talking about the &quot;Congratulations! Your browser is set up to use Tor.&quot; (or something to that effect)&nbsp; welcome page, where your LEGITIMATE ;) IP address is displayed? <br /><br />If so, that page has also not displayed for me in about 20 hours or so.&nbsp; IDK if this is because I am a world traveler or if this is due to some other reason.&nbsp; Anywho, I can still access onionland without that one page loading properly.

				Hi - I wasn&#039;t saying Tor is blocked at present, I was saying that this is something that I think will be touted as a solution to the problem of these people sending these sick images whilst hiding behind the anonymity of Tor.<br />From what I understand, it is possible to block Tor at the ISP level, and it is something that has been suggested in Japan.<br />In the law makers eyes, the &quot;hidden&quot; internet is the playground of terrorists, child abusers and evil drug peddlars and it would be possible to stop it.<br />And of course there is the old favourite slogan, if you&#039;ve done nothing wrong, you&#039;ve got nothing to hide, so why would anyone be worried!

				Ive got an interesting conspiracy theory ive been mulling over for the last couple of days....<br /><br /><br />So the military industrial complex develops the darkweb, they can obviously shut it down if they want... but that&#039;s not what they want! <br /><br /><br />They run the drugs and pedophilia trade! They want to perpetuate the darkweb! <br /><br />DISCUSS

The Tor Project can email you the executable file (zipped), you can have the exe. file sent to you on a thumb drive or a CD, etc, etc. More info. about this can be found on the Tor website.

				Interesting conspiracy theory from Walter White, also heard suggested they run the bitcoin laundering sites so in fact they can keep an eye on where all the bitcoins are going as well.<br />I don&#039;t believe that for one moment though !
