				Shit i hope that title gets some ones attention... I wish someone would have slapped the fuck out of me and told me to the first time I (personally) tried to get BTC for MP on the SR. My IRL friend had succesfully done it a few weeks before, so I was in a positive mood about it.<br />Well my first attempt was with kingcopkilla, hes banned now, got my MP as one of his last orders.<br />Success:scam ration, 0:1<br />Trying again now with *namewithheldfornow*, relatively new vendor with good reviews. Almost all of them claiming money within 1 to 4 hours. So at a little over a day after placing the order my nerves are fucked and I&#039;m feeling a 0:2 ratio coming on.<br />le sigh. Moral if the story, if you know a noobie IRL slap that fucker and tell him localbitcoins.<br />Also, couldn&#039;t a vendor just get on SR, make a few extra SR buyer accounts, purchase a couple btc orders from himself (that wouldn&#039;t happen obviously) and then review 5/5?<br />Man I miss having competent IRL friends who knew there way around the road, shit is bothering me now.<br />*I am actually witholding his name in case it comes through, still within the window but damn why is everyone else apparently getting there money in hours and I&#039;m at a day?

				Hmm. I used a domestic bank-transfer service. No risk of scamming, and it worked well. But it took a couple of days, and it is not really anonymous. But then again, BTC&#039;s aren&#039;t illegal and it was just to get started with a small amount so I&#039;m not really worried. I&#039;ll probably start sending larger order on SR over time, and then I should getting my BTC&#039;s somewhere else.

				Yeah, I had just wanted to be anonymous from the get go was the thing, not even connecting a $5 transaction from my IRL identity to my SR identity. In all honesty I shouldn&#039;t even be that worried, its simply because my only other experience was getting scammed that I&#039;m all twisty.<br />And you&#039;re completely right; BTC&#039;s aren&#039;t illegal. But neither are rolling papers/headshops, but you wouldn&#039;t want the law seeing you with either of those now would you. Obviously having bitcoins doesn&#039;t carry the same % chance your using them for drugs as having rolling papers does, but you still get my drift: its a lil sketchy looking, and I&#039;d prefer to not be sketchy looking at all. Why? No reason at all, but hell it couldn&#039;t hurt could it? (pshh... I say after getting scammed).<br /><br />But if your looking for another place apparently localbitcoins is the shit, look all over SR forums, people are practically foaming at the mouth about it. IDK yet, depending on how this vendor handles this situation, I&#039;m probably either coming to him for all repeat business or going on localbitcoins exclusively from now on. <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel like having to go through this &quot;just trust that you get you BTC eventually w/ no prior experience or evidence, other than some random words saying 5/5 that anyone (including the vendor possibly? see my question) could have said&quot;&nbsp; SHIT again...

Oh wait maybe b/c I&#039;m a noobie im being made to suffer a bit just to be safe, okay..... then I thought, wait I don&#039;t even KNOW who is posting the reviews, the listing is free, and SR accounts ARE FREE... he could just make accounts, buy his free listing, finalize it, and post reviews talking about how FAST it was moving money between his wallet, and also his wallet.

				It took us 3 weeks to get a wire approve to mtgox. The feds are trying to lock the access gates where they can. BTC is a serious threat to the Federal Reserve&#039;s &quot;fiat green toilet paper&quot; ($) <br />...so, tired of waiting, we got lucky on localbitcois with a local BTC trader who transferred the coins within 5 minutes of bank deposit verification.&nbsp; text him @ 2069206312 (!min $500!) don&#039;t jerk this guy around with trivial test skepticism... he&#039;s a legit BTC Professional Trader. BTC isn&#039;t just for SR its a hot topic for serious investors losing faith in the US government. Soon we will offer a registered 501c3 non profit corp to transfer BTC online free and fast. SR is more the anarchy... its a long overdue revolution against tyranny...

				forget about mt gox.<br /><br />I used local bitcoins, but I did the transfer in person. he doesn&#039;t know my name I don&#039;t know his.<br /><br />if you do a bank transfer there is an electronic trail. fins someone locally meet them in a coofee shop...give the cash once he shows you on his mobie phone the correct code that the money has been transferred. if you are really paranoid...bring a laptop and make sure the money is in your account before you hand over the cash.<br /><br />A lot of times the bitcoins sellers are laundering money, but often they are just ordinary dudes who make bitcoin by mining or whatever.

				I&#039;ve been checking out localbitcoins, and there&#039;s a seller there (from my own country) who I know from before from a couple of clearnet forums I used to frequent. I&#039;m going to use him next time. But seriously, I see newbies here struggling for a long time getting BTC&#039;s and getting scammed. If you&#039;re just starting out as a small-time buyer like me, I think you should be more worried about getting scammed than leaving a paper-trail. Though Bitcoins feel shady and dirty, it&#039;s completely believable for people to buy one or two simply for fun or out of curiosity.&nbsp; And once you have a couple in your wallet and have placed your first order, you calm down and can look for more with a clearer head.

				So I got my Bitcoins: Despite me constantly messaging the vendor and having a piss poor attitude I recieved my bitcoins today, within his 48 hour window. Faith in SR: restored. now 1:1 success:scam ratio and it &quot;feelsgoodman&quot;. <br />The vendor was BitcoinGanja; he was incredibly professional even when I wasn&#039;t. I&#039;d recommend him to a friend; but like I said, i will only be going to either HIM or localbitcoins from now on, fuck this trusting new people shit; especially with MP. It took him a lot longer to give me my BTC (assuming because A, my MP was for an ugly amount (not big, just a strange amount, not like 100,200,150 etc, and B i was a total noob.)<br />*sings his gonna-get-drugs-now song*
