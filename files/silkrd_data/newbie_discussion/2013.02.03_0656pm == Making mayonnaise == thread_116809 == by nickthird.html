				I&#039;m trying to make burgers with mayonnaise just like the professional establishments use.<br />The regular mayo from the supermarket tastes nothing like it (much worse).<br /><br />I really like mayo.

				I&#039;ve tried all the ones we have here (just two): Hellmann&#039;s some Spanish company.<br />I&#039;m currently using Russian mayo I recently found out about, its better, but no where near the real thing.

				<br /><br />To make 1 cup of mayonnaise you will need:<br /><br />1 cup of light olive oil (less strongly flavored than standard olive oil) or other good-quality oil, like walnut or sweet almond oil<br />1 egg<br />Juice of 1 lemon, or vinegar<br />A pinch of salt (and pepper, if desired)<br />Water to thin the mayonnaise<br /><br />2. Separate the egg. Reserve the whites for other recipes.<br />3. Egg yolks contain a natural emulsifier, lecithin, which helps thicken sauces and bind ingredients.<br />4. Lemon juice or vinegar adds acidity and flavor to the mayonnaise. <br />For each cup of mayonnaise, add between 1 and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice or vinegar, depending upon your tastes.<br />5. Combine the egg and acid in the bowl, whisking to mix.<br />You can make mayonnaise in a food processor or by hand, with a mixing bowl and whisk. The key for either method is to add oil very slowly, in a steady stream, while the processor is running or you&#039;re whisking vigorously. (Note: to stabilize a lightweight mixing bowl, set it on a coiled kitchen towel.)<br />6. Continue to whisk constantly, adding the oil in a slow, steady stream.<br />If the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you desire. Add about a teaspoon of water at a time.<br />When the oil is all mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture.<br />If it never thickened and you&#039;re stirring a puddle, chances are you will need to start over. (Or, if you&#039;re still partway through the process, you can save the emulsion by adding another egg yolk, whisking vigorously. Add in remaining oil, plus extra for a double recipe), and adjust the seasonings.<br /><br />now i wanna try this as well&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />8)

				Marco never lets me down<br /><br />2 egg yolks<br />2 tbsp white wine vinegar<br />1 tsp english mustard<br />1 tsp whole grain mustard<br />Olive Oil<br /><br />Place the egg yolks into a bowl, add the vinegar and whisk. Slowly pour in the olive oil a bit at a time whisking constantly. Add both mustards and stir through the mixture to a smooth consistency.

				Go to fast food establishment, and then ask to buy the mayo they use. Just offer a silly amount of cash and the employees will probably just pocket it and give you a shit load of mayo

				If anyone has a really great mayonnaise recipe, you should definitely get a vendor account and list it.&nbsp; Last I checked, there aren&#039;t any mayo vendors on SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s a completely untapped market!

				Costco kicks ass!&nbsp; It&#039;s more or less the same as Sam&#039;s Club, if you know what that is.&nbsp; Basically, they sell consumer products in bulk.&nbsp; Also, they charge a membership fee to shop there so they are able to lower prices even more than WalMart or other retail stores are able to.

				Mmmm....<br /><br />&nbsp;I am professional Chef and I can tell you few good recipes, but for now I will explain the one that is much close to my heart, my mother traditional recipe!<br /><br />Need:<br /><br />1 egg<br />1/2 garlic clove ( 1 if is small, and remove the interior green part of the garlic)<br />we use xtra virgin olive oil, but you can use sunflowe, or olive oil,or try... ;)<br />A bunch of like 8 gms. of fresh flat parsley.<br />a pinch of salt<br />and a good hand blender (stick blender)<br /><br />so! try to prebiosly remove the egg/s from the refrigerator, for them to be at atmosphere temperature,<br />add the egg/s in a tubular container that it fit the hanblender but not very dancyng on it,<br />then add the garlic (peeled), the parsley (a bit chopped, to make it smooth faster) the salt.<br />and then, this is the &quot;complicated part&quot; you need to poor the oil slowly as you emulsionates (wisk ) with the handblender.<br />You can put almost as much oil as you want to make it larger, if is to thick, just add some water.<br /><br />Insted of garlic and parsley you can try with almost anything, like, mustards,seeds,vegs,even fruits or nuts!!<br /><br />hope is of your interest guys!!
