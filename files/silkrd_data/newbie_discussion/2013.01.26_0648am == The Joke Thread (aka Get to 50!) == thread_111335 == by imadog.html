				A speedfreak is out walking one fine evening. He finds a poor person on the street and helps him up. The poor person says, &quot;Son, I&#039;m a genie. And since you helped me I&#039;ll give you three wishes.&quot;<br /><br />The speedfreak says, &quot;I want a big bag of meth!&quot;, the genie says.&quot;Okay.&quot; POOF, the bag appears! They prepare some thick long white lines and share it between the two of them.<br /><br />The next morning the genie asks &quot;What&#039;s the second wish?&quot;, &quot;I want two big bags of meth&quot;, says the speedfreak. &quot;Okay,&quot; says the genie. POOF! And they prepare it and snort it between the two of them.<br /><br />The next morning the genie asks &quot;And the third wish?&quot; &quot;I want four big bags of meth!&quot; POOOF!! So, they prepare lots of big lines and share it between the two of them.<br /><br />Much later the genie gets up and says, &quot;Okay, it&#039;s time for me to go.&quot; The genie takes a couple of steps, pauses, turns around and says, &quot;Okay, just one more wish.&quot;
