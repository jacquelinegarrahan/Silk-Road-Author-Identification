				I saw a view posts were new vendors offer free samples of narcotics to big vendors in return for some good feedback???<br />Can somebody tell me if there are people who are really so stupid to give away their adresses???<br />Seems to me that when you are a big vendor,&nbsp; that you must have a brain in the first place otherwise you would not become one.<br />I think its for the best if you never ever let drugs sent to your home when you are a vendor.<br />Take this idiot in australia for an example. He had a good thing going ,but because he ordered a not so large,&nbsp; but pretty large amount of drugs on the net he got caught. <br />The package led the cops straight to his home were he had cash, dope, scales, needles and weapons???<br />and rule nr 2 is dont leave your stuff in your home.( ofcourse rule nr&nbsp; 1 is&nbsp; dont get high on your own supply)<br /><br />Are there any vendors who still order from sr also and how do you do this??<br />

				Entrapment may be a crime but it means nothing if they want to get you they will. trust. as for getting stuff sent if you are a vendor then have a separate address of course!

				What if L.E starts a vendor account and offer you some free samples???<br />You give an adres and you are pretty much fucked<br />Were i come from they put i pads in cars in front of the window, and the just wait until some junkie comes and get it. Isnt that pathetic???<br />And by now they are probably so frustrated because they cant beat tor, they will pretty much do anything to show to the world they got one of us.<br />Getting samples as a vendor trough sr is a verry dumb thing to do.
