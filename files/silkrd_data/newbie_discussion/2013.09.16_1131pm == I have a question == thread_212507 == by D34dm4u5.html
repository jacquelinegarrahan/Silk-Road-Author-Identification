				How do i know for sure that when I am browsing on TOR that I am not being traced? What are some ways I can know for sure that everything that i look at is going to be confidential and cannot be traced?<br /><br />I&#039;m using a MAC OSX

				I&#039;m Using a Mac also -- Can you ever REEALLLY know though?&nbsp; Its good that your IP address shows up as one completely foreign to your own, that&#039;s a plus.&nbsp; Then whatever encryption methods you use to communicate with will follow suit.&nbsp; But everything is traceable if one really wanted to...its just a question of is it worth all the time, effort and resources to do so.&nbsp; Overall I think it&#039;s pretty safe, but nothing is 100%

				try checking your IP that will show you, ya know like the first page that shows up, or maybe TOR is a giant honeypot by &quot;the man&quot; whilst selling and sending massive amounts of drugs worldwide they are also getting everyones addresses then in however many years they do a raid on everyones houses at the same time...........................................<br /><br />Or maybe you should take off the tinfoil hat as it&#039;s not helping clearly i can still read your brain waves from my satalite

				TOR offers strong cryptographic guarantees that you are not being traced. The only way that you can be traced (as far as we know) is if every relay in your TOR circuit is compromised.

				its not that you aren&#039;t getting traced.&nbsp; if the nsa et al. what to trace you, they will.&nbsp; its just statistically harder for them to while you are on tor.&nbsp; the more measure you take the more difficult it becomes.&nbsp; that simple.

				Shisha is right but i think there are more ways which we not even think about.<br />F.e. you don&#039;t know if there&#039;s something implement in your network controller, CPU or main board that&#039;s a backdoor for the government. Something like that...<br />

				If anything ever happened with BTC, someone would create a new super currency that would be even better than BTC.&nbsp; It&#039;s on the way.
