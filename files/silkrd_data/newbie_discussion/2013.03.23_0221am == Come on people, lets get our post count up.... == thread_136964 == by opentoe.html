				Then again, maybe the Newbie board is the best place for that. For the true newbies, those new to the forums AND SR itself, RCs are what we&#039;ve had to rely on, too naive to know better. Too straight to know the dude man in real life for anything beyond the ganja,&nbsp; or perhaps too lazy.

				@MFresh:<br />Hello friend, welcome to the coolest place on the newbie board. TommyTucka over here was just providing some musings about life as a newbie, strung out on research chemicals while he waits on International orders of that elusive &quot;good shit.&quot;<br /><br />This is probably a stupid question, but have you tried searching on the Road? There has to be someone there who can fill your order, although it&#039;s a pretty massive one (by my standards anyways...I&#039;m a poor, poor man). If your desired amounts aren&#039;t listed, try messaging some of the SR vendors, I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be more than happy to relieve you of your bitcoins. Maybe get it shipped in multiple installments, idk. I never buy big; just enough for me, myself, and sometimes I

				nice, good call. Hopefully you&#039;ll hear back from some others. Are you looking at domestic only or international? I think there are way more vendors with way better quality overseas.<br /><br />I&#039;m from the states too! Northern midwest. Whereabouts are you?<br /><br />And where&#039;d you get that name? it reminds me of the intro to workaholics, if you&#039;ve seen it. If not, go watch the show right now.

				And so, as he makes his 51st post, little Tommy Tucka proves to himself and the world that he ain&#039;t no clucker. He moves on to the big leagues, the main event, and all told, the dream of the &quot;other forums.&quot; It&#039;s been real for lil&#039; TT in the newbie pad, and he would be the first to acknowledge it. But the times they are a-changin, and a hard rain&#039;s a-gonna fall. But the answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind, and so is tommy. <br /><br />Ayo whaddup yall - shout out to my man BoyMaster, the homie pharmacypowder (review comin soon my man!), Liston, MFresh - I know we just met, but shiiit, real recognize real yo. The one and only Mike Tyson, and Cus D&#039;amato, still waitin for that cage match. ContrabandOnDemand, DeluxeDelivery, QualityMeds, Natasha, etc. Keep it up. Thanks to Opentoe for getting this thread started and catapulting me into the 50+ range. Whaddup Walter White, you crazy murderin&#039; sonnofabitch. Props to Wadozo for guiding me through my early days, and to Scout for always helping out. Finally, a moment of silence for the late Mac Dre.<br /><br />Blucka blucka blucka. Tommy Tucka, muthafucka. <br /><br /><br />Yep, took that way too seriously, or not serious enough. WTF am I doing? I&#039;m gonna go post on some benzo thread now in the rumor mill!<br />But for real, Wadozo and Scout kick ass, along with all the good folks in the PGP practice thread. It&#039;s good to have their help.

				@ELAV8:<br />Newbies can still post in customer support, and I&#039;d highly recommend doing so. That got me a full refund in a similar situation with no communication, etc. In fact, I just posted about it in another thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137037.0<br />Hope that helps. And again, post in the customer support forum. They have mods that will get back to you within a few hours if not quicker and give you step by step advice.

(Pause) You know, if someone had written a book about you, and you were over here in New York and they&#039;d written a book out in California that had told a whole lot of lies about you, some old king had come along, and he held race slaves, as I said, we— The blacks amaze me the most. They&#039;ll hold onto that black book. And King James was the first one that sent the Good Ship Jesus to Africa, to bring us back in slave chains. The way they got us, the way they got the Union of South Africa today, a black person cannot even go out of the house after six o&#039;clock at night in Union of South Africa. And Africa no longer controls. They killed— they came there in the name of the Calvinist Baptist faith, a few years ago, Union of South Africa, said they were gonna educate the people, and Africa didn&#039;t need any education, they had all they needed. They had freedom, they had the land, but they sit down and let those missionaries talk to them, and while the missionary, one of them was talking to them, the rest of them took the rest of them off, and killed them. Killed their leaders. And now in the Union of South Africa today, a woman cannot be with her husband, because she has to work— he has to work, and they cannot travel at night more than a mile from where they work, so a wife will not see her husband for a year, or her children. (Pause) (Calls out) You wake up over there, child, I&#039;ll throw some water on you.

				The external features here are <br />just as causally relevant as typical internal features of the brain.[*] <br />*[[Much of the appeal of externalism in the philosophy of mind may stem from <br />the intuitive appeal of active externalism.
