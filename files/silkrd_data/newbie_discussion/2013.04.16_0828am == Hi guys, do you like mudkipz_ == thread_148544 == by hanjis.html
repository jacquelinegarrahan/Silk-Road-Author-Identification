				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />TA2E - A review of Changa, and my trip report<br /><br />Delivery time - In my case it was 5 days, but that DID include the weekend, so more like three business days.<br /><br />Stealth - This vendor really did a good job with the stealth packaging. When I first opened it up, I was trying to remember when I ordered the package it was in lol. After opening all of the way I had a good chuckle.<br /><br />Communication - TA2E, is very friendly, and quite communicable. Unlike many vendors who prefer not to be contacted, I have found TA2E to be personable and a superior communicator.<br /><br />And now for the wonderful experience that TA2E&#039;s Changa has brought me...<br /><br />(I used a simple vape pipe for this.)<br /><br />first hit - I felt nothing at all. Tasted as expected, and not harsh at all really.<br /><br />second hit - Feeling the warmth of the vapor enter my mouth, the tingling feeling is just starting. Very slight wobbling effect noticed.<br /><br />third hit - On my third draw from the vape pipe, The warmth of my exhaling breath turned suddenly from feeling slightly wobbly into watching all sorts of shapes and patterns coming closer to me from a great distance, which was at the same time not so far away. That may seem absurd, but I can imagine no other way to describe my experience. As the objects came closer to me, I noticed that there was one particular object that felt as though it was wanting to communicate with me visually. Next, as I got face to face with it, I penetrated the object,&nbsp; or perhaps the object allowed me entry. Imagine floating into a giant drop of molasses, if you will. I can only describe the object as a circular membrane or bubble. When I entered the object, the shell of this object was vividly web-like in structure and then instantly became very animated.<br />I quickly lost all my bearings. There suddenly was no up, down, left or right. I knew I was once again in that familiar place known as hyperspace but I forgot who I was and how I got there. I was honestly in absolute awe as this &#039;web&#039; shell morphed into what appeared to be a green plasma-like being with flailing appendages similar to tentacles that were moving VERY fast and appeared to be tending to some task quite dilligently. In addition when these tentacles would move they would emit a reverberating set of tones each movement produced a unique set of sounds. Soon I became aware that this &#039;being&#039; was actually redirecting my awareness to these *incredible* structures that were made with his appendages/harmonic manipulations. Some of these structures reminded me of things on Earth. One was a pyramid. Another, was a burial mound. The most shocking was a DNA helix, and I don&#039;t know why I felt shocked by that revelation. As my experience lingered on, I noticed a shining spot on this being&#039;s head. As the spot became bigger, I then saw the faces of literally every human being I have ever met, within that infinitely tiny spot smiling at me. <br />Before long I noticed a pressure in my center and I realized once again I was contained in a physical vehicle and that I was perceiving the weight of my hands interlaced on my solar plexus. My ego was reassembling itself and the web/being simultaneously was losing it&#039;s animate life-like qualities. <br /><br />As I was coming out of hyperspace I realized I was more than just a creature of independent flesh, but that this journey has revealed to me that there is no such thing as duality. Everything and nothing, positive and negative, it is all simply a charade. We are all the same source from different perspectives. I went into this journey with severe depression, and anxiety. I leave this journey understanding how to eliminate my depression. For me it is perspective change.<br /><br />I want to thank TA2E for providing me with the such a wonderful tool of awakening the truth that lies inside of us all. I am broke at the moment, but I assure you that when I get paid, I will be seeking out more great changa from my new favorite seller; TA2E. <br /><br />If you are reading this, and are having problems deciding on which vendor to go with, I strongly suggest TA2E, as he has a leg up on his competition in every aspect that is important to us consumers.
