				does anyone know if these are actually the 150 mics mentioned or do they feel as less? These were sold some time ago, few months.<br />I ask this as I will only be able to take between a half and 3/4 and if it&#039;&#039;s 100 mics I will be underwhelmed.

				I tasted them and in my opinion, if not exactly 150 ug they&#039;re pretty close. A friend&nbsp; of mine, first timer, actually freaked out on one of those tabs and needed some help to get out of a bad trip. One question though - sorry if it&#039;s obvious to you: have you stored your tab carefully? Light and high temperatures can easily halve the effectiveness in a few months.

It feels CLEAN. It was easy to babysit my friend out of the bad feelings. Little OEV, a few CEV. Music sounding fantastic. In order to have a strong lisergic experience I think I need 200+ug myself. Everyone&#039;s chemistry is different, maybe you also have some natural tolerance?
