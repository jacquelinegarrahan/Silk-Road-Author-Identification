				Hello fellow travelers!<br /><br />I will be selling clonazepam in small and bulk quantities. They&#039;re only 1mg a piece but I will be selling at a reasonable price of around 2 dollars a pill, at a minimum of 3 per order. I will offer priority and express shipping which will be exactly the price at the post office. I will also be selling #4 Heroin. As this can be a tricky sell in terms of potency and quantity.. I&#039;ve decided to take in 60 orders for an absolutely unbeatable price (plus for the shipping you desire) of a .1 sample. I am only doing this to establish myself as a legitimate vendor. My connection is willing to front me a decent amount and all I ask is that the first 60 prospective buyers pay for the shipping and a minor .10BTC. This means FEing but the listing will be for 0.10BTC plus the cost of either priority or express shipping. Trust me, I will be losing alot of money initially due to vendor fees and the initial amount I need to ship out. If this is something you would be interested in please let your voice be heard so I can determine whether it will be worth it for me to go ahead and get enough money to upgrade to vendor status and get these listings up asap! Look forward to doing business with you fine travelers. I can assure you that the quality of the heroin is absolutely amazing, 60mg had me pins and needles, driving like a trucker coming down off a meth binge and I have a monster tolerance. So please leave your username and I will keep a list up to 60. As for the clonazepam, I can offer 50 2 pill samples for 0.02BTC plus the shipping you desire. All transactions will be provided with a shipping number! So let me know if this sounds interesting to any of you crazy cats out there!<br /><br />anon123

				Oh, and the Priority shipping option will be 0.10 BTC and the Express will be 0.20 BTC.<br />No signature required. As soon as the lists fill up, me and a partner will be mailing the packages in a very discreet and efficient manner. Tracking numbers will then be provided, and then all personal information will be shredded. From past experiences I have learned the most stealthy, efficient means of packaging and if you want extra protection I will provide an extra option for priority and express that will only add a couple of dollars.<br /><br />anon123

				Well, I forgot yet another thing to add... Benzos and dope make me one forgetful boy haha.<br /><br />I will be shipping to US, Canada, and UK as a trial run. Of course the Canada and UK shipping prices would vary but not much I&#039;m assuming. I&#039;ll need to research that but I can assure you I won&#039;t be charging exorbitant rates.<br /><br />anon123
