				Hi there. I was wondering why i couldnt post in a Review Thread until i found the newbie section, and the fact that im only able to post here. Unfortunately neither here nor somewhere else you find a pinned Thread giving Details about it, or what is required to post in all Sections in this Forum. Judging by the first and most frequently used Spam Thread in this Newbie Section it seems you need 50 posts? Despite the fact that its a pretty high amount and only leads to senseless spam, at least there should be a pinned Thread somewhere explaining the Newbie Status and the requirements to get out of it. I honestly doubt posting a serious Review here would get a lot of attention, and i really dont have the time or will to spam 50 non sense posts to make 1 relevant post afterwards to be honest.<br /><br />cheers

				just to push this Thread and give an example to what this section leads to, right now there is the whole Front Page of this section spammed with the same Thread, advertising some bullshit fishy Bitcoin vendor. Even though i get that this is one of the Reasons for this section, it still makes this section pretty useless to any serious user. Maybe you should think about an optional way to apply for a early release out of the newbie status by writing a short &quot;essay&quot; about why YOU should be released early, on the other Hand this would probably produce a lot of Overhead work for admins, which are probably having a high &quot;workload&quot; already :(

				Yeah I know - all the spam and those stupid &quot;get to 50 by posting random bullshit&quot; threads really piss me off.<br />And you&#039;re right about the 50 limit - it certainly does seem to be encouraging people to make 50 random, meaningless posts just to be able to post in the grown-ups forum.<br /><br />Pretty sure that kind of thing is not quite in line with the spirit of the 50 post limit.<br /><br />I think the whole idea behind it is that until a newbie has made 50 valid contributions to the community, they may not be entirely familiar with the protocols governing forum communications.

				Yes it is 50 post to be able to post a comment elsewhere in the forum.<br /><br />To be honest i think spamming to 50 is the wrong attitude to have, why don&#039;t you join the community read the vast wealth of knowledge that has been made available to you, get to 50 without spamming and i guarantee, you will be a hell of a lot more knowledgeable in how to protect your online identity. <br /><br />And if you really want, write the review here and i will re-post in The Rumor Mill.(make sure to include the name of vendor + name of product so i can make a relevant Topic header)

				I for one fully support you in this worthwhile endeavour.<br /><br />Not sure if all those who reached 50 posts by posting crap like &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; in those threads realises that anyone can, at any time, view all the posts that they have ever written.

Not that i dont like personal stories and its no offense, but its hard to find Reviews for other Vendors in here without scrolling through 20 pages just to find about maybe 5 non BM/CC related Reviews.<br /><br /><br />Vendor: MethylonDE<br /><br />My first purchase on SR so im going to write a rather detailed Feedback.<br /><br />Delivery Speed: arrived 2 days after order domestic, pretty much as fast as possible. 5/5<br /><br />Packaging: Product in a Baggy, Baggy in a Vacuum Seal. Perfect 5/5<br /><br />Communication: None needed. Adress sended while ordering as an encrypted PGP message, 2 days later you have a smile on your face. 5/5<br /><br />Product:<br /><br />First Look: Surprised a little at first look, since i was expecting the snow white Product you see in the picture, in fact its more into the yellowish to orange/brownish color, but hey i am new to SR and its not Amazon in the end. Never had this buying locally but its probablly depending on the synthesize routine used.<br /><br />Product is dry/powder as subscribed, with a very slight amount of moist left. Pretty much perfect for sniffing right away.<br /><br />The smell is medicore and a very familiar smell. Medium nose burn, had stuff in the past that had much harder nose burn.<br /><br />Quality: I had a longer break from speed so my tolerance is pretty much down to zero, thats why i just took a small line for now but i can feel it coming already. I guess its decent quality for the price. Not high end but he doesnt promote this anyway like other offers here (which judging by reading some forum posts and feedbacks isnt true in most cases anyway).<br /><br />I might give an update later on the quality, for now it seems to be pretty good for the price, big plus that its already dry, so you get what you pay for. If you are looking for dried/powder domestic speed definitely give this vendor a try.<br /><br />Overall a solid 5/5.&quot;
