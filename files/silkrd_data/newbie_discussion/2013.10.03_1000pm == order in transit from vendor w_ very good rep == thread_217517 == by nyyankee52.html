				I&#039;ve had an order in transit from sept 21 but I&#039;m assuming it was shipped the 23rd. I spoke with the vendor (who had a very good rep with lots of good feedback a couple times since it&#039;s normally a 3 day delivery) on the the 27th and the 30th and he said he&#039;d resend it if I didn&#039;t get it by Oct 2nd but the damn site closed down before I could message him back saying I never got it. I didn&#039;t finalize (even tho at this point all the $ is gone anyway) but he didn&#039;t mention anything about finalizing early even tho I was relatively new to the site. I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t choose priority mail but at what point do I give up hope that 1) it was even shipped or 2) that if it was shipped I will actually get it??? It is domestic and I have heard of people waiting a couple of weeks for their package even with priority mail so idk what to do. BMR sucks and so does sheep. Any advice???
