				I have not seen dia morphine I.E heroin in vial form advertised once I have heard a vendor speak about getting it but nothing now I know there are a lot of vendors who ship from countries where it is legal and even in places its not well I know there would be vendors smart enough to make a batch up of home made vials just need good gear. P.S not that some of the gear on here isn&#039;t good its very good some of it but just a suggestion. I thought of since trying some fent vials which were great and made by very smart ppl so it can be done lets lift the mark even higher for this place we are ppl fighting for the right to choose what goes into our mouths veins and nose and lets make it the best it can be if our governments wont look after our wants and needs we can do it ourselves DOWN WITH PROHIBITION!
