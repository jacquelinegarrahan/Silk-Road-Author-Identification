				the problem is that there appears to be a minority of socially isolated people on the boards and they like giving bad karma.&nbsp; particularly in threads like this where people are asking about it, it seems to bring out the nasty side in them.&nbsp; (almost all of my bad karma has come from posting in threads like these - hey ho).<br /><br />What I do now is give out balancing karma when I see that someone&#039;s been hit with the nasty stick, particularly with the real newbies as it&#039;s just not fair on them.&nbsp; So when you finally reach 100 and you&#039;re good to go with the karma wand, just remember that you have that option too..

				It is unfortunate that you need the 50 posts, but I can understand where the powers that be are coming from in wanting you to establish yourself prior to posting... Looking at people&#039;s first 50 posts can give you a basic idea of who you are talking/dealing with.<br /><br />Magicpearl and Abby:<br /><br />You are both correct in my opinion. If someone has a difference of opinion, instead of respecting you for your beliefs and opinions, they immediately go with &quot;Your wrong, I&#039;m right and that makes me better than you.&quot; This is generally speaking, not everyone falls under this (Just making that clear). Those that differ in belief or opinion, chances are likely that if you say something very simple, even stating you are meaning no offense, they are going to take offense to it and hit you with bad karma. It just comes back to the fact that no matter how hard we try, we can&#039;t please everyone.. I&#039;ve come to quit trying to please anyone else. I do what I need to do to take care of me. I want nothing more than to help those that are worth helping and I go out of my way to do it. So don&#039;t think by saying I put me first that I am conceited or greedy.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my wall of text. Hope your day is everything you want it to be. :)
