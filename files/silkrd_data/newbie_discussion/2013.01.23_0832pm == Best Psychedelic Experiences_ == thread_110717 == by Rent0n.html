				in our quests for 50 posts, I thought I would open this thread. so lets hear about some awesome trips! looking for anything on LSD, shrooms, ketamine, DMT, even MDMA. lets fill this thing up with whatever psychedelic drugs you want want to talk about. but lets keep it positive! <br /><br />LSD is my drug of choice. i waited for a summer day i was off from work, put on headphones and laid out in the yard under a big ass tree. watching the trees sway and appear to communicate with eachother and myself was awesome as the sky took on a fluid tie dye color. main thing with me is i have to be outside. btw i was listening to a lot of 60s psychedelic music<br /><br />i had an amazing MDMA experience in my home once by myself with headphones on laying on my bed. ipod on random, louie armstrong what a wonderful world came on and i listened to it 20 times in a row (probably more), each time more beautiful than the last. i never could reconstruct that experience no matter now hard i tried.

				LSD had always been my drug of choice until I snorted 1mg of 25B-NBOMe a couple of weeks ago. It was like acid squared. Waaaay better than any of the other NBOMe&#039;s that I&#039;ve tried:)

				DMT has been my favorite. I did some Yayo and took a few hits of dmt. Wandered through my house and every room was full of different geometric patterns contstantly changing size shape, spinning all kinds of things, the walls started to melt down as if to enter a new visual plane, the walls got about half way down but stop there then began to go back slowly. Felt close to a breakthrough but not there yet. Fucken love that it only lasts like 5-10 minutes really is the businessman&nbsp; trip

				I love all psychedelics.&nbsp; But LSD is my favorite.&nbsp; Shrooms com in second and to me are quite different.&nbsp; My best trip so far on anything came from Tessellateds LSD just this last Sunday to be quite honest :).&nbsp; I am definitely looking forward to purchasing more from him.

				DMT is my favorite with LSD coming in at a close second then it&#039;s pretty much tied with 25i and shrooms, but personally I love all psychedelics

				I think I definitely prefer mushrooms over LSD. I&#039;m more experienced with mushrooms, but I find them to allow me to connect with myself better and it&#039;s more of a full body experience. I&#039;ve definitely had a good time on LSD but the most i&#039;ve taken was two hits of around 100 mics.

				It depends on what I&#039;m going into the experience wanting/needing/looking for.&nbsp; If I&#039;m looking for visuals acid and 2C-B are AMAZING!&nbsp; I&#039;d also highly recommend hippy flipping, the visuals are decent and it&#039;s more of an introspective trip. :) <br /><br />I offer these wonderful experiences in my shop. I don&#039;t keep them listed at all times as my stock is finite and not very scalable.&nbsp; Pm me on the road and I can list a few of the variety you&#039;d prefer. I&#039;m sorry but I&#039;d prefer to do business with established buyers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here a while and I&#039;d rather not deal with the volatility or risk associated with fresh accounts.&nbsp; I understand that this discounts many of you here; however, I&#039;m also aware of people who have been here a while and aren&#039;t necessarily active on the forums.&nbsp; In fact, I myself fit that mold.&nbsp; In any case, when I hit 50 posts I&#039;ll be making a thread in the product offer&#039;s and offering a couple slightly discounted samples.<br /><br />

				Had a very interesting time my last trip, on 200ug of acid. Was looking at pictures, seeing what&#039;ll happen after a while, cos usually they&#039;ll start to move for me if it&#039;s recognizable objects which is always awesome. Like something out of Harry Potter, where all those photos and stuff are actually moving! Anyway, this one picture I got to thinking about what was going on in it, the motivation of the character, and was listening to some music at the same time, one of the lyrics was just &quot;Wake up wake up wake up&quot; repeated over and over. And wow, very hard to describe, but things seemed to come together and it felt like I was stepping into a dream, into the universe depicted in this picture. To my regret now, a sort of reality-check reflex kicked in and broke me out of it... but I think with a little training (and perhaps a higher dose next time) I&#039;ll be able to sort of, step into this dream without jerking myself awake. That promises to be a very cool time... ;D<br /><br />Never quite sure whether I&#039;ve experienced everything LSD wanted to show me for free, and if I want to see more and go deeper I&#039;m going to actually have to put in the work and effort to discover it and find it out... or if that&#039;s just grossly underestimating or disrespecting the power of acid :P Perhaps a bit of both... probably still does possess the capability to surprise me, but only if I put in a little effort on my end to be receptive and willing to let it show me ;D

				Psychedelics have synergies with each other and I&#039;ve found that adding another variety of psychedelic multiplies the effects of each.&nbsp; Jedi Flipping is rather intense.&nbsp; Having some xanax on hand to pull oneself out of a bad trip is always reassuring too. :)

				My first shroom trip not having any idea about dosages boys being boys put majority of what they had picked into some simmering hot water and drank it as a tea, for 30 mins i didnt feel any different so we decided to have another cup until i got half way thru and had to put it down because the television started melting&nbsp; before my eyes, it was like nothing i have experienced before. i almost didnt have the courage to leave the lounge room because it was dark outside but we eventually went outside into the back yard i remember looking up a the huge tree and seeing one of the branches grow before my eyes it was incredible to say the least. After that i was fixated on the technology of the iphone and the physics that were being used in the aps like doodletruck LOL

				Took 6 tabs of Jerseycow&#039;s LSD after a concert. At roughly 172 ug a tab, I had ingested over a mg of LSD. Most of the people that crashed in my apartment did exactly that...crash. I stayed up and eventually left to ride the train around and grab some food. I had a few moments of intense paranoia, but did my best to just assure myself that I was only temporarily batshit insane and I could handle most anything with positivity. I bought cheese fries and a chicken sandwich from a 24 hour hot dog shop. Most of the experience was admiring architecture and art and my music. I was also coming to terms with my fear of the unknown. It was essentially a Jazz funeral in my head with a different soundtrack. Appreciating life despite death. It&#039;s hard for me to quantify the meaning of my experience and I&#039;m sure even harder for you to understand why it is important to me, but I feel that is nearly everybody&#039;s struggle. They can know that something is meaningful, but they don&#039;t necessarily have the words to communicate it.

				That sounds like a positive trip. However, I would never suggest someone consume that much LSD and go out and about; especially alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think most people unless they&#039;ve got a fair amount of experience shouldn&#039;t consume that much acid without a trip sitter.&nbsp; Just my opinion.&nbsp;
