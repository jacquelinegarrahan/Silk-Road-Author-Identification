				I believe it&#039;s critically important for all patriots worldwide to help secure the election of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as president in 2016.&nbsp; He is open to running and has a good chance to secure the GOP nomination. From then on it&#039;s 50/50.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s important we support him because he will go as far as anyone to end the stupid war on drugs which disproportionately hurts young black men and the Obama DoJ medical marijuana raids in California and elsewhere hurting patients and business. Rand is not owned by any special interests and will therefore rely on small dollar donors. <br /><br />This is where DPR comes in.&nbsp; I am sure SR is profitable and I&#039;m wondering if maybe he would be able to - some how - funnel some illicit profits into Rand&#039;s campaign in the US considering he will not be relying on special interest cash from the usual sources like other candidates (Wall street, prison and military industrial complex etc).&nbsp; These are the same stooges who fund Bush/Obama and all the rest. Meaningful change is just a pipe dream with these guys in charge and wholly owned (sorry Obama supporters).<br /><br />So what do you say DPR? Would you be open to it? Does he even read the newbie forums? :) <br /><br />Good luck with your continued success and for anyone else reading... check out Rand PAUL&nbsp; For freedom, for liberty.<br />
