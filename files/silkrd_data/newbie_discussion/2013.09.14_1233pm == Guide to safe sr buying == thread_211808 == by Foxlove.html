				Yes, you can supply a vendor with your address in plain text.<br />But by doing so your putting alot of trust in that vendors skills as a drug smuggler lol.<br /><br />Think of it this way<br /><br />Say the vendor were to get caught, and the cops get access to his SR account. If he hasnt deleted your shipping info, boom you just got a warrant for your arrest for buying drugs and having them mailed to you.<br /><br />So, if you use PGP Encryption to provide your address, the police would need that vendors PGP password in order to decrypt your message sent to the vendor.<br /><br />And since in america, you have the right to remain silent, there is no way the police will get that password.<br /><br /><br />Setting up PGP is very easy.<br /><br />Download this<br /><br />http://www.gpg4win.org/<br /><br />( Make sure when you install it, you check the box that says &quot; GPA &quot; )<br /><br />Youll be prompted to enter some info when you start up GPA the first time, name, email bla bla.<br /><br />You want to put fake information for this, Like for your name, put your SR username, and email just random bullshit.<br /><br />Next, you will be asked to make a Password, and backup your key.<br /><br />Okay, so now you&#039;ve got your shit set up, now you have to import a vendors key to your keyring.<br /><br /><br />Open wordpad, and copy &amp; Paste the vendors Public PGP Key, and save it as &quot; Vendor Key.txt &quot; ( You can put in multiple, GPA will pick up every key you put in that text file )<br /><br />Okay, So now open up GPA again, and you&#039;ll see a button at the top that says &quot; Import &quot; Click that, and then you&#039;ll be lead to a window where youll have to locate that Vendor Key.txt file you made. <br /><br />Once you find it, import it and a small window will pop like &quot; 1 key found , 1 key imported to key ring &quot; or something like that.<br /><br />Now, you have that vendors PGP key in your keyring.<br /><br />Now to the important part, sending an encrypted message.<br /><br />Click &quot; Clipboard &quot; type out your address or message, or whatever your gonna send, then click &quot; Encrypt &quot;<br /><br />A window will pop up with all the keys on your key ring, pick the vendor you are trying to message, and then hit Okay, if done right the message should be encrypted and can now be sent to the Vendor. <br /><br />( Hope this was easy enough to follow )

				As a general rule to vendor ratings;<br />5/5 is of course, preferred, however you always need to check how many transactions this is out of and the reviews written.<br />Anything from 4.7-5 Is reasonable, and as a vendor sometimes unpreventable so as long as you check the feedback and the vendor reviews, you should be fine.<br />Below that is when you, if you need to buy from this vendor, spent a few minutes extra asking around the forum, checking reviews and vendor stats.<br /><br />You should NEVER F.E unless you are 100% sure that this is a trusted vendor (Even then, try not to).<br />There is also a buyers guide specifically for this, you will find this at the side of SR.<br />~D

				I&#039;ve been buying for a while but I FE&#039;d for a vendor as a aplogy while BC price was high because I had caused him some panic because I thought the cops that were watching the pot dealers next door were watching my drop box. NOw it&#039;s been 6 days for priority since he marked it in transit and I&#039;m worrying. After buying thousands of product without making a dumb mistake before this, I feel like an ass....<br /><br /><br />... Well, maybe I&#039;m just being impatient.
