				I&#039;m a newbie so this is just my 2 cents. yes you can send bitcoins to a second wallet and then send them back to your original wallet. I hear that you should stagger your return send with different amounts and different dates.

				I use instawallet.org to send it through a few temp accounts before transferring to SR. I&#039;ve heard the electrum BTC client automatically sends your entire balance to a temp address, the amount you entered on from there and the difference back into your original wallet. This obscures the value of the transaction. SR also tumbles when you send to your account and make any transactions. You can check blockchain.info to see what addresses sent to your SR address, and for me they never match any instawallet one i used.

				Honestly your bitcoins being traced back to you/ your IP is probably the last thing that would every get you in trouble. In any case, if you are truly paranoid then make a separate blockchain that you only access through Tor, take your clean blockchain and just use the built in custom send function to anonymously send them to the &quot;dirty&quot; wallet. Then if you&#039;re really paranoid about being watched by the KGB you can do another anonymous send from that wallet to the road, which already has a built in tumbler. The main thing is to vary the amounts you send, as someone else already said I believe. I will say that I have done a pretty fair amount of Moneygrams for myself and others, and I have almost always used my real information. I have actually been asked for ID on rare occasions. <br /><br />Anyway, remember bitcoins themselves are not illegal, and neither is trading or exchanging them. Hell, I would think even sending bitcoins to a wallet on the road is really in a legal grey area. (That&#039;s not to say that I don&#039;t take precautions myself).<br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t been recommending Instawallet as a transfer wallet anymore due to problems my friends have had with it. (Funds disappearing for over 24 hours with Instawallet support being sketchy).

				The dirty wallet I was referring to is the blockchain wallet that is dedicated to Tor access only.&nbsp; blockchain.info (clearnet domain) is a really good wallet and also provides a search feature so that you can parse the record of the past and present bitcoin transactions that are going on. This means that if you send bitcoins to X address, you can look up said address X on blockchain&#039;s search function and it will show you how many confirmations have been attached to that transaction. A general rule of thumb is after 6 confirmations the coins will be spendable on the other end, but this number is not really concrete whatsoever. Make a wallet on blockchain and experiment around with it a little bit it&#039;s good practice.<br /><br />Also note that there are many ways to work with your coins and &quot;clean&quot; them. This is just one of my preferred methods and I happen to like blockchain because there are more backup and security options than you can shake a stick at.

				It doesn&#039;t matter how many wallets you send your coins through the blackchain will show the BTC going through all those wallets/transactions. <br /><br />In order to be anonymous you need to send BTC from several different wallets to bitcoinfog. This tumbles the coins for about 2 hours, then you can send them to your SR wallet.

It pretty much does the same thing bitfog does. Even if you don&#039;t use it, it&#039;s still difficult to track a transaction and pinpoint with certainty where the bitcoins came from, or who spent them. Especially when you vary the quantity that you move between wallets and do it at different times.

				It probably helps to vary the amounts of bitcoins being sent and to use different wallets etc.<br /><br />But SR also apparently tumbles the coins anyway. And at the end of the day, I doubt that buying from SR is in and of itself illegal. It depends WHAT you&#039;re buying. Unless you actually get caught with an illegal product, you can always claim you were buying something that&#039;s legal in your country, such as a set of scales or some salvia.
