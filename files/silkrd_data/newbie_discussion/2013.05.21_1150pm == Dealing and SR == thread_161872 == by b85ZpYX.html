				I use SR for personal use/very close friends, but does anyone find it disturbing how easy it is to deal once you know how to use it? <br /><br />No interest in dealing, but it just seems like an easy in to a potentially slippery slope.

				the idea comes to mind for sure, but what quickly follows is a series of bad scenarios where i end up in shitty situations. this helps to quell the thought of being a local cool drug guy with tons of chicks and money and drugs and OMG IM DEALING NOW BRB

				I gave into the temptation of it. It was pretty hard not to considering I can get a gram of Ice on the road for around $110 and then resell it for $1000 where I live...

				I can definitely see the temptation. The only thing is, weed on here doesn&#039;t offer that great of a markup, it&#039;s mostly about the same price as I&#039;d get it for locally or a little cheaper. It&#039;s the only drug I&#039;d be comfortable selling and be able to build a customer base easily - I don&#039;t know enough about MDMA and I don&#039;t know enough people who are into psychedelics for that to be worth doing.

				I am currently tempted to use SR for dealing a bit myself... the psychedelics are a good item to flip as in my area they are rather difficult to keep around consistently, and with the purity of a lot of the powders it would be easy to step on them and then be able to make a bit of a profit. I hate buying stepped on shit though so i wouldnt be able to ethically do that. In my area an lsd tab goes for $15 to $20 and so if I were to buy a full sheet or 2 I could flip them for some decent cash..... god it&#039;s way to tempting isn&#039;t it

				Do it on a small base. I buy weed from La Fuente and resell it with a win margin of 8€/g.<br />I know a few people and those people know a few people. Everyone of them buys around 20-30g each time he passes by and then they distribute it to their friendscircle. By that I sell around 200g a month and that is a nice extra income.<br />IMO the risks by doing it like that are low, since basically I know only around 10 people and those are good friends of mine.

He would have to smuggle it to the US, where most of the costs come from (coke tripples it value once it is in the us for example).<br />And yea, I don&#039;t understand the system of the customs yet, since around 70% of his packages got to me so far. Maybe its a random control or different control points over which the packet is being sent to Europe. So in the end it might be dependant on the route your package takes to Europe.

I can see the point tbh. I bet a lot of people are tempted to dive right in without doing the proper research and taking the proper precautions.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;m far too paranoid to ever try dealing (on SR or IRL). I&#039;ve just made my first purchase today and I&#039;m already wearing a tinfoil hat and rocking back and forth in the corner.

				I guess, I haven&#039;t seen any American customers saying his packages have been seized so it might not have to be that difficult. I don&#039;t know how US customs work though and he&#039;d have to have a few different addresses to ship to or it would arouse suspicion very quickly, so again I have no idea on the feasibility, just purely speculation. I suspect that you&#039;re right though, or we&#039;d probably already be seeing American vendors selling Mexican weed for prices close to La Fuente&#039;s, but there just isn&#039;t anyone. La Fuente&#039;s prices are so fucking good no one even comes close. Closest thing is that Swazibud guy, but even his weed is like 3 times the price and appears to be much lower in quality. It would be amazing if someone from a country with less of a... reputation could offer prices anywhere near his - hopefully someday!

I think LF still has a nice profit margin for mexcian standarts, yet other countries vendors can sell it for more, simply because of the country they ship of. People are greedy, thats why they will take the maximum margin - if they can.<br />IMO just invest some extra time and risk the run with LF, he will do a reship if your order gets lost.

				I&#039;m quite ignorant as to how much weed costs to produce, but imagine how much business a vendor from Europe, US or Canada would do if they sold mids at £80 an ounce for example.

If we could compare weed to something, I would say its compareable with beer, whereas MDMA is more likely the vodka.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t feel right if I would sell higher amounts of MDMA to a single person due to its neurotoxy and the danger of that person to abuse it. I sold small portions, such as .5 to persons I do know, but only after giving them a few informations about how to consume it and how not to (for example that partying on it isnt the best, drink a lot of water, don&#039;t mix it up, don&#039;t do it more than once a month, etc).<br />I have a mate who does sell it in bulks, yet his view on that substance is different than mine. IMO MDMA is a beautfil thing, but it isn&#039;t candy. It&#039;s quite dangerous if you do it too often and it can fuck up your life deeply. <br />I read a nice post by someone in this forums a few weeks ago, sadly I forgot his full name ( it was some doctor giving advices).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only way I know to avoid loss of magic and depressive symptoms is to be moderate in dosage, frequency and contexts.<br />&nbsp;To leave MDMA for special occasions and not to make it an habit. This could sound obvious, but I think it is not only a question of neurorreceptors. It is much easier.<br />Suppose that you like Disneyworld. The first time you go you will think it is fantastic but, if you go every weekend you will finally get fed up of White Snow and Donald Duck.<br />&nbsp;Properties of MDMA are so specific that if you use it too frequently it makes you bored. I think it is also important not to expect too much from it, I mean,<br />&nbsp;some people get obsessed with &quot;getting high&quot; as the first times and that conditions the experience. It is also important, in my opinion,<br />&nbsp;to realize and think about some effects of MDMA that can be learn during the experience, but applicable to everyday life.<br />Someone told me that the first time you take MDMA is similar to &quot;learn to read&quot;.<br />&nbsp;Once you have done it, your perception of reality (and your perceptions of further MDMA experiences) changes. You can´t learn to read twice, and, in this sense,<br />&nbsp;the first experiences will be different to the rest. But you can still enjoy the substance if you are cautious in the way of use and don´t expect too much.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe that does help you on your way of understanding it.

				I&#039;ve made my living dealing weed for the past 5 years without the Road. I am definitely tempted to use it to start selling some exotics to my close friends and dependable weed clients. I am more tempted to start selling trees here on the Road as I can get comparable stuff for ~1/3 of the price.
