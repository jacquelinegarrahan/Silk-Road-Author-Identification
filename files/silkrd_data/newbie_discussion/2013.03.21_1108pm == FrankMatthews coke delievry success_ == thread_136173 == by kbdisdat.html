				I know Aussie&#039;s that have received from Frank, but there are no guarantees.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve heard less envelopes are getting through now.<br /><br />Last November/December I was on holiday in Aus so I ordered 2 grams from c63amg, who has slightly better stealth (in my opinion) that FM.&nbsp; These were two separate envelopes (to Sydney) and neither arrived.&nbsp; The vendor said a lot of envelopes were getting seized, so I&#039;m guessing the Aussie customs are pretty hardcore.&nbsp; This pisses me off as I&#039;m moving back to Australia in a couple of years and don&#039;t want to pay local prices for drugs.<br /><br />It sounds like FrankM and c63amg are both making minimal promises to Aussie customers. No re-ships and only 25% refund, or no refunds.&nbsp; Simply too many envelopes getting seized.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s envelopes from NL that have been red-flagged.&nbsp; You could try a vendor from a different EU country, as long as you can be sure their stealth and vaccum sealing is top notch.<br /><br />In my opinion, Aussie customs have profiled the top NL vendors and have samples of their different envelope styles in the &#039;sorting&#039; office, to help customs staff identify similar envelopes (looking for same printed labels, envelope type, return address, etc).&nbsp; This means the sorting staff can more easily pick out the ones which are likely to be SR orders.&nbsp; Bastards!<br /><br />PTF
