				me being impatient as fuck, dropped two halves at 805. 835 started to feel my hands a lil sweaty, waves of euphoria hit me slowly, by 845-900 i was approaching my peak, right then and there i popped another one.(stupid me) BY 915&nbsp; at full on peak, my jaw locking up, my mouth feeling dry, feeling nice, my rug feels awesome, the lightshow am watching on youtube is epic all of a sudden. peak coming down by like 1ish i wanna say? but am not sure. fell asleep ok, the next day a had a lil afterglow, my jaw was sore and body was too.the buds made it 2x better. they are legit, not much of upper roll. more like really clean bean which what i was hoping for.<br />apollonian +1

				Ok, so I received my order.&nbsp; Got 1 Blue superman.&nbsp; ITs been about 10 years since I rolled, and about 5 years for my wife.&nbsp; We split the bean in half, ate it at about 10pm.&nbsp; I was very excited waiting for it to hit, and when it did, MY GOD!!&nbsp; Off of a half!! everything changed to a dim yellowish light. Almost like some beautiful twilight scene.&nbsp; It took my wife about an hour to start rolling, but when she did we had a blast.&nbsp; Hung out on a blanket in my front yard tll about 4AM.&nbsp; Jaws were clinched and kinda sore this morning.&nbsp; I highly recommend whatever you&#039;re doing, wherever you&#039;re at, do a fucking hand stand!! lol.&nbsp; Had a great time!!
