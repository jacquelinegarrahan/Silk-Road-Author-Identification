				Hi Noobs,<br /><br />When we ask this question, we don&#039;t mean the obvious simple answer, i.e. &quot; I look at the highest rated seller and then the feedback, etc&quot;.<br /><br />If that is your method, can you explain the method YOU use on SR? - do you use the search feature? or do you &quot;browse&quot; by category.....do you only look at domestic products?<br /><br />We are also interested in where / how else you make your decisions? - Is it mainly on the newbie forum? or browsing the other sections?<br /><br />If so, what engages / sways you to decide to buy from a &quot;new vendor&quot; rather than an established high rated seller?<br /><br />Do Text &quot;quotes&quot; or Signatures work?<br /><br />Or Close Up pics of actual product like this? - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d30d7863ab<br /><br />We Elves are very interested in everyone&#039;s comments.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />Brought to you directly from the Real(m) <br /><br />Machine Elves.<br />

				I browse by catagory it fucks me off when shits not where its supposed to be (because i know what i want)<br /><br />It has to be a photo of the actual product with the vendors name in photo not photoshoped onto it <br /><br />Ill give new vendors a go because of escrow...simple as new vendors cant ask for FE (also if new offer better prices or other incentives to run the risk)<br /><br />If established vendor I read the feedback and discuss sections and browse the forums too <br /><br /><br />

				INTERESTING QUESTION.<br /><br />Replies to this will be useful for all &quot;New Vendors&quot; who are trying understand the though process of potential buyers.<br /><br />Honestly, I think everyone will differ in their attitude and some will ALWAYS just play it safe, only sticking to high rated vendors and never &quot;taking a chance on something new&quot;.<br /><br />Personally, I love to try lots of varied products but what sways me is always the &quot;branding&quot;, the profile and the initial communication.<br /><br />I love to message new vendors and ask them a few questions, essentially asking them why i should buy from them!<br /><br />It&#039;s their responses (their vibe) that generally sways a purchase of something new.<br /><br />And on the question of locating the vendor, it&#039;s been a mixture of stumbling across a vendor in the forums or by searching by category and seeing something that jumps out......normally the image at first.<br /><br />Hope this helps and would like to hear others comments&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;m relatively new to SR, but as well as all the main site searching and reading of discussions and reviews, I also like it if the vendor links to a review thread on the forum.<br /><br />It&#039;s the &quot;full disclosure&quot; that reassures me.<br /><br />Peace.

				A little bit of ground work doesn&#039;t go wrong.<br /><br />Check vendor profiles, and feedback and get a rapport with them first. It will tell you a bit about the vendor.<br />how quick they respond to messages, what they write etc.....<br /><br />Thanks

				I just made my first order. Looked up what I wanted, checked the box for domestic, checked feedback ratings, reviews and the forums, checked the vendors page to make sure they didnt want me to FE and they accepted orders from noobies and placed my order :)

				What I did was look for the best deals. I read their profile and start branching off to other vendors with similar deals. Usually other reviews and the way they present themselves get my attention.

				I look exclusively in the section im interested in, which in my case is the opioid section. then click the domestic only box. I then read feedback mostly as all dealers will say their product is the dogs. I believe the user over the dealers any day of the week. just need to buy some bitcoins and im laughing.

				I pick my catagory, then sort by lowest price first.<br />Then find something close to what I&#039;m looking to spend.<br />Check for pictures and seller feedback.<br />Check for shipping frequency. I prefer vendors that ship within 24 hours

				It depends on what I am planning to purchase.&nbsp; For example, I refer to the Avengers thread before purchasing LSD.&nbsp; But, in general, I review buyer feedback.&nbsp; I also review the forums to see if a seller is receiving good reviews, alright reviews, or bad reviews.

				With SR, I don&#039;t want to take any chances. I only buy from people with only 5 ratings, with very few exceptions. I don&#039;t want to be the one that gets the shitty packaging or the cut product, and if the vendors ratings are all 5 I don&#039;t have to worry about that.<br /><br />I will only buy domestically unless I am really desperate to find a good deal. I don&#039;t want to risk anything with customs as I don&#039;t really know the process for sending packages to other countries.<br /><br />The thing that really turns me off is high shipping, I have to say I&#039;ve avoided a lot of vendors I would of bought products off of because of the high shipping.<br /><br />I also find my vendors from either the best selling section or the lowest price listings (has to have good ratings) if I&#039;m making a purchase and I have an extra .1-.3 Btc<br /><br />I would be more inclined to buy off a vendor if say for every $400 you spend on their products, you get a free gift or % off you&#039;re next order.<br /><br />Close up pictures don&#039;t really do anything for me, as long as it has good ratings I could care less what the picture is.<br /><br />I would never buy from a new vendor. The best way to get me to buy from a new vendor would be giving out free samples or putting a reduced price on their products.<br /><br />The last thing that gauges my interest in a vendor would be their listing has to be legit. If there&#039;s poor grammar and spelling mistakes everywhere and a shit title, I&#039;m going to expect the vendor isn&#039;t that smart and has more of a chance to fuck up my order by either not packaging it right, trying to rip me off, or just being negligent.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />With SR, I don&#039;t want to take any chances.

Would it be beneficial if someone from the community, an active member, or even a vendor, created a thread for requests? Someone could go there and request something, and then the thread holder would update the OP, and then vendors could go there and see what kind of requests people are wanting and if there&#039;s certain things people want more of.
