				Hey just wanted to start this thread as i want to get to 50 post and also avoid mindless spam!<br /><br />Just wanted to hear peoples thoughts on silk road, I would love to have ability to sort through the vast amount of sellers and products in a more efficient way. <br />My 3 things are:<br /><br />1. Filter out products that do not ship to my location<br />2. Filter out Vendors based on feedback score<br />3. Sorting of products by price and weight<br /><br />

				If you check the &quot;Domestic&quot; only button that will only show venders that ship to you for sure.&nbsp; I feel like it&#039;d be a lot of extra work for the vendors to explicitly list every country they don&#039;t ship to.

				I thought the domestic only option just gave you vendors located in your country?<br />Also all products already have information on where it ships to but you have to individually check as there is no filtering system.

				1. I would change the domestic filter a little (or make another similar option). Let&#039;s face it: if you are in EU, with the only exception of the UK maybe, you don&#039;t want to list only your country&#039;s vendors (especially for those countries where there are almost surely no vendors), but all those inside the EU (since it would work mostly as domestic for the USA in this way).<br /><br />2. Probably a revised feedback system. The 1-5 is not working so well, because anyway anything below 5/5 is the same as negative. At this point it would be probably better something similar to BMR with positive, neutral and negative only.<br /><br />3. Possibility to check money value of BTC also when you have BTC as default and possibility of checking the value also in EU and not only dollars (depending on your country, naturally).

				When you do a search, have the ability to sort by category/location.<br /><br />Update the feedback system so that 1 bad mark doesn&#039;t ruin rep. Make it so the vendor can respond directly in the feedback box to negative reviews. Split the feedback into separate areas for stealth, speed, quality etc etc.

I think there are some vendors who, much like on eBay, lower the price of the product and make shipping costs ridiculous to make up for and even exceed what they&#039;d normally make. I think having an option to sort by combined price (i.e. product + shipping) would balance out some of that by forcing vendors to not take advantage through shipping. The only problem I see with implementing this is that shipping costs can vary on a product due to domestic vs. worldwide.

				The feedback system is too ambiguous, making 5/5 or 1/5 the only obvious choice for most people. It needs to be restructured.<br /><br />Also, filtering by product weight would be a great addition.

				Basically, a lot can be learned by analysing the changes eBay has made over the years to their system. (feedback system, search system, product filtering system)

				Add Litecoin as a payment method!!!!!<br /><br />More vendors reshipping (so you can order 10 items from 10 diff vendors all to a reshippers house then have them reship to you for a small fee once theyve examined the items and re packaged the into one stealthy package that will be sent domestically. <br /><br />Better prices and selection of drugs would be great to see as well!
