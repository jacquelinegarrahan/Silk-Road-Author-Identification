				No shit.&nbsp; They are scammers.&nbsp; They spam the forums every day and the only reason you aren&#039;t used to it by now is because the other moderator and I are on here all day every day trying to delete their accounts as quickly as we notice them.&nbsp; However, you should understand that they are using some kind of script or something that allows them to post over 20 new threads within a minute&#039;s time.&nbsp; So be a little patient and understand that we delete their accounts as quickly as we are able.
