				its a percentage, the highest being 100%. Its not the best way to judge a vendor as its a broken rating system, and people can leave fake feedback. If the vendor is 95% or up you should be fine. Search the forums for the vendors name, and read any reviews. This will give you better information than the feedback on their profile.

				What tops off is the amount of transactions shown for a vendor, at 300.

				what sucks is that a 100 implies no complaints (or no resolved complaints) every in the vendors history.&nbsp; &nbsp; in reality it means they are consistent, probably great customer service, and have drugs that people want enough they don&#039;t want to piss off.... because most won&#039;t sell to you again for less than 5/5.<br /><br />so that&#039;s is broken.&nbsp; &nbsp;but vendors have to be that way because the way it is setup, a 94 and below might as well be a 54.&nbsp; &nbsp;10 complaints from the wrong people (it is weighted and relevant buyers impact it different) and even though you have 390 perfect txrns.... now you have a 95.&nbsp; &nbsp;which isn&#039;t that bad if system was not designed to let users blackmail the vendor (basically), the vendors to punish the customers (blacklist), and there was some type of &quot;middle class&quot; amongst the ratings.<br /><br />As it stands today, if 3% of you total sales were to same assholes that send their food back at a restaurant 50% of the time (you know if this is you, or you know someone like this) you now look like a scammer, and asshole, or some just some lazy dude.<br /><br />if it were corrected and reflected a true customer satisfaction index there would be only a select few with 100&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;anything in the 90&#039;s would be good (it sure fucking would in every other industry on earth )&nbsp; anything in the 80&#039;s would mean mistakes have been made but 8/10 would recommend to another.&nbsp; and below that is a case by case thing.<br /><br />as is stands you are either perfect basically, or you are fucking&nbsp; horrible.&nbsp; &nbsp;there is no class of&nbsp; &quot;average&quot;&nbsp; vendors because of design and asshole vendors/customers both using it as a weapon.
