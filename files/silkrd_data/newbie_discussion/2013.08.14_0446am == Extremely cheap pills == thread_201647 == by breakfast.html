				I noticed today that the vendor overseasmeds is offering a free OXY 80 mg and all you have to do is pay for shipping!? This sounds too good to be true. I noticed that he also sells copies (fake pills) and has a lower score than most vendors, so I feel like this isn&#039;t as legit as it seems.<br /><br />Nobody has yet to leave feedback for the listing. I sent him/her a message and am waiting for a response. Does anyone have any experience with this vendor or something similar?

				I have no experience with that vendor, but would apply &quot;if it sounds too good to be true...&quot;

				Its not unheard of vendors to do this. I ordered a sample of a drug and all I paid was the shipping (which of course was pretty high lol).... It arrived ok, was seriously underweight, but what can you do, its was in essence free.. it was enough for me to sample the product and decide it wasn&#039;t for me though..<br /><br />If its cheap shipping, its maybe worth a look in, I guess the vendor wants some people to try his product hoping your order more. <br /><br />I personally would place an order, if you get asked to FE early run a mile! You might be surprised, and if it is a fake pill, well then you paid a small fee to work out this vendor is one to avoid :)
