				&nbsp;I&#039;ve only made one BTC purchase/transfer, so I hate that i have to start all over. I formerly used BitFloor and Instawallet to get cash --&gt; BTC into SR account. Both of these services are closed. I have considered blue sky traders, but they can&#039;t seem to take deposit request emails from a Tormail account. I don&#039;t feel safe creating a yahoo/gmail account, and emailing them this way. Maybe it is okay though! I don&#039;t know how much about localbitcoins or other services (bitcopia, etc.). The more anonymous something is, the better. ( (i believe bitinstant now requires photo ID?). I have set up an account with BitcoinFog, and am first trying to get ~500 cash (and resulting coinage) into this account as an intermediary. <br /><br />WHAT BITCOIN SERVICE SHOULD I USE??<br /><br />I have heard blueskytraders quite a bit, but is everyone really creating yahoo/gmail accounts to obtain their services? I know obtaining bitcoins is not illegal, but unless you are a miner/trader, one can assume what you&#039;re doing.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple recipe for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
