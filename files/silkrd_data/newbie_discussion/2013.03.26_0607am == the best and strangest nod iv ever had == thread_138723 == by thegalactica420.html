				hello fellow road goers id like to share with you my recent experienced with the best nod iv ever experienced and hear your story&#039;s of amazing nod. so it goes like this last night i decided to get nice and fucked up, started of with 120mg of morphine in the form of mscontin orally, then 900mg of gabapentin. started getting a small buzz from the morphine and decided to do a small bump of k around 40-50mg, right before i blew it i popped 20mg of hydrocodone. did the k felt pretty damn good just pain free and floaty. surfed the web and watched dexter for an hour or two and then decided to take some soma. popped 1050mg now here is where it gets interesting, when the soma kicks in it feels like everything i took decides to peak all at once. its almost overwhelming but&nbsp; i welcome the nod that is quickly approaching. i can barely keep my eyes open, getting eye flutters like im peaking on mdma, every inch of my body feels absolutely amazing. i sick into my chair and just lay there nodding off and laughing to my self till about 5am.&nbsp; i wake up to several people texting me asking if im okay cuz i kept sending them nonsense. i hadnt been able to catch a real nod for a few years now because i wont use the needle but this put everything else to shame. by far the best downer combo iv ever tried, im just glad i was smart enough to put all my temazepam away before i fell into it. but please be carfeul dont just go trying this because i did i have a tolerance to everything i used. anyway just thought id share! have safe travels on the road!&nbsp; ;D
