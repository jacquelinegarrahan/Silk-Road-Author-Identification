				I am not going to details. But I ordered &gt;10g weed from the western Europe country. Yesterday I saw the letter in my post office that my package has been delivered. Since I have good experience with that retailer, I wasn&#039;t worrying. All my packages have gone to the post office. When I arrived there, they were not able to find my package. Today I got call from customs and they were trying to organize a meet-up with me. I refused. In morning I got call that some strange guy was looking for me. So I am kind of confused. I definitely refuse to meet them and asked them to send all the details to my email. Also one order before that was lost, so the seller sent a new package. It arrived few days later like I explained and now some suspicious guys are looking for me.

				You can always deny to customs that you knew anything about the letter (they must have got the wrong person, address, from a database etc). I don&#039;t know how customs work in estonia but in the UK they know this and just send you a love letter asking you to come and collect it (which you obviously ignore lol) I doubt you will be hassled any further, but it might be a good idea to clean your house up and get rid of any sketchy items for a bit until it blows over.

				Definitely clean up your house and prepare a good story just in case they knock at your door.
