				Alright, so I started taking Dipenhydramine as a sleeping aid.<br />It worked great the first night, and the second. And the third.<br />But not the fourth.<br />A quick google search indicated that DPH build up tolerance quickly.<br />Alright, no big deal. Take 100mg instead of 50mg.<br />Fast forward 3 weeks later, my dose is at around 1200mg per night to get the same effects as 50mg.<br />So I stopped, because this obviously isn&#039;t good for me.<br /><br />The world is spinning with me, I feel immensely sea-sick, I can&#039;t sleep, and there are fucking spiders EVERYWHERE, plus parts of my body randomly twitch sometimes.<br />For the love of Christ, how long does this last?

				I&#039;ve been in the same situation, but never ended up taking that many! That is quite a lot, obviously you have a huge tolerance. Anyways, i also felt pretty shitty the following days after i started taking around 250mg a night to sleep, groggy and like a zombie sometimes. If you need to i may suggest tapering down instead of stopping completely because it will be very hard to fall asleep if you&#039;ve beenn using it for a month then stop.<br /><br />But it shouldn&#039;t last more than a few days ~ week at max. I don&#039;t have any scientific proof or anything, but just from experience. DPH has some long term effects if you use high doses very often, it can be bad for you. So try to take less, or take a break for a while. Some natural supplements that promote sleep you can try would be Melatonin or Valerian root (or both) they help me relax and fall asleep. good luck!

				For those side effects you should take an antipsychotic. I recommend Olanzapine or Chlorpromazine. Both should be available on the road. Bonus: they will get you to sleep.
