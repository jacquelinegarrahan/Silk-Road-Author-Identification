				I get the whole thing about posting in other boards other than newbie but what can you post there that you cant post here?<br /><br /><br />the whole board here is sometimes clogged up with these 50 post threads, maybe a time limit to evolve from newbie to full blown user would be easier.<br /><br />I just dont get it.

				I fail to see what the 50 post rule does to help anything, since there is no rule about setting up a thread to spam to 50.&nbsp; Hell the main reason I am replying is so I can get to 50 so that I can post to vendor&#039;s review threads.<br /><br />The vendor review threads are very important in my opinion, and the 50 rule probably stops some folks who would use them but don&#039;t feel like getting to 50 just to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />2 down, 48 to go...

I was just 1, 2, 3 etc. posting with occasional rants to myself, bitching when someone chimed in and said it was supposed to suck and was there for a reason.&nbsp; I&#039;m aware enough to know he was right but that wasn&#039;t my first gut reaction but I held my tounge when I normally wouldn&#039;t and I think it was because I knew he was right that the rule was for a reason, but I kept thinking the system was screwed up and causing such a mess and important posts to get lost until I realized it was not the system, it was people liike me trying to spam to 50...&nbsp; I made it to about 12, said fuck this and started fresh and vowed not to spam to 50(almost broke that vow to post in a thread but I saw this, thank you).<br />Well, my point is I personaly think it is needed and spamming to 50 should NOT be allowed as these forums take some time to learn and there are consequenses just like on SR proper.&nbsp; I mean look at the vendor posting buyer contact info a week ago and other crazy shit. Unless you were here before and had to come back to start fresh, my .02btc is that it is important to spend some time on here and learn how different this all is.&nbsp; I think most of us forget the consequnses of what we are doing.<br />Stuff like tails etc makes it so easy to have enough tools to get by here without the knowledge to use those tools that it is easy to get lulled into a false sense of security and it only takes just a little mistake for bad things to happen.&nbsp; This is the real deal, and though it&#039;s not the only show in town it&#039;s high profile.&nbsp; SCUM SWINE like high profile.&nbsp; The other thing is we not only have the ability to hurt/endanger ourselves here but also others and the community.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stick to trying to use my 50 posts to get to know some of the people here and the right and wrong ways to do things and hopefuly save myself some headaches in the future.&nbsp; I am not trying to preach, if you can get to 50 in an hour and think that&#039;s fine, just my experience as I&#039;ve learned.<br /><br />ALSO:&nbsp; As it&#039;s taking me some time to get out of newbie hell I don&#039;t want to ditch my profile and start over because I put work into building relationships and reputation as at the least a decent person

				A valiant effort but perhaps spamming to 50 is akin to a petty crime such as jaywalking?
