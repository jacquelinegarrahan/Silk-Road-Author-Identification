				The man: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/53555a9222<br />The legend: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/80e256fb39<br /><br />So being the newbie i am, i searched through the road for someone who don&#039;t demand that i FE. And i found jor.<br />But for some reason the only hash jor would send outside the eu is the fez. That made me somewhat sad since i&#039;ve only given myself 1BTC for this SR experiment.<br />But nothing can ever go smoothly, so i loaded some more money and ordered.<br />Before the buy i had the chance to talk to jor abit with my silly newb questions and concerns and he was very responsive and nice.<br /><br />So the money went through, and a day afterwards i see the item has been shipped. And lo and behold, only 7 days later (which is very nice for the shithole i live in) it has arrived!<br />If i wouldn&#039;t know what it was, i could have easily been fooled. There was even a return address.<br />Inside hidden was my prize. So i opened up the packaging to be greeted with a powerful stench that came out of nowhere. &quot;Whoa, so this is the stealth people kept talking about&quot; i though, smiling to myself.<br /><br />Later that day, being an idiot i threw some of it into the MFLB - forgetting that good hash melts. FUCK! Cleaning the MFLB took away attention from the little i had a chance to vape.<br />Bong it is then.<br />Loaded up and took the first rip - not too big, since i haven&#039;t smoked in a while. It didn&#039;t feel very powerful with only a slight kick at the end of the exhale.<br />Then i took a 2nd rip, and it felt the same and a slight buzz started to come over me.<br />Content with smoking a tiny amount - think a toenail clipping, i though to myself &quot;this is nicer then the crap i tried&quot;.<br />When all of sudden -&nbsp; (CLEARNET) http://i.imgur.com/GANoJ.gif (CLEARNET)<br />Damn..<br />What?<br />Awesome :D<br /><br />The sneaky bastard got me thinking i was high just to catch me unprepared and blow my mind.<br />A very nice body high, locked into the couch when the only think that can move me from it is the promise of food.<br />Yes, the munchies were strong with me. This stuff can cure anorexia!<br />I think i ate half the house.<br />I wasn&#039;t too hazy to understand what&#039;s going on TV.<br />I giggled my ass off about the dumbest things ever.<br />I couldn&#039;t believe i got this from smoking and not from an edible.<br />I wasn&#039;t tired, but once i got to the bed i went out cold into one of the deepest and most energizing sleeps i&#039;ve had in quite a while.<br /><br />Next morning i wake up and I&#039;m feeling normal, not bloated due to eating the whole house just feeling refreshed.<br />So i wake and bake - What&#039;s left of that toenail. That kept me at a [6-7] for over 6 hours.<br /><br />This is the best thing i&#039;ve smoked/vaped/eaten in my life.<br /><br />Now just to find a good brand of sativa and i&#039;ll be content.
