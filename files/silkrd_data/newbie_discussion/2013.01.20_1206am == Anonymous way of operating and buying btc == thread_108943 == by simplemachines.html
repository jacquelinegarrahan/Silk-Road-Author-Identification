				This site seems good..&nbsp; &nbsp;https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />I was going to use it because guys will accept paypal and email transfers, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No fees, from what I&#039;ve seen and can communicate with seller/buyer for best method of payment.&nbsp; &nbsp;I , might use this site next time around..&nbsp; You can even find some pretty good priced BCs.

				The best way to buy bitcoins is just to buy from vendors here it&#039;s 100% anonymous. <br />But if you want to sell your bitcoins I recommend my anonymous debit cards and bank accounts it&#039;s great to deposit money from bitcoins there anonymously.<br />

				Bitcoins aren&#039;t as anonymous as you think. The entire ledger is in the public and a lot of companies who deal with bitcoins have to keep records for legislative reasons (MtGox certainly do). You should really use #bitcoin-otc and deal with individuals rather than companies with anti-money laundering policies, never mention bitcoin and use the same vendor as often as possible. Use a &quot;real&quot; Bitcoin client and when you&#039;re sending make sure you do it through Tor so it&#039;s never tied to your IP address.<br /><br />If you were heavily into tinfoil hat fashion then you&#039;d get your Bitcoins by posting used bills and a bitcoin address to some post office box. I&#039;ve not found anyone running such a service yet though, if I did then I&#039;d be using them because it&#039;s what everyone should be using.

Remember bit coins are not illegal and can now be used to purchase all sorts of things, not just goodies on SR.<br /><br />There are some reputable vendors on SR who sell bit coins, just make sure you do plenty of research before taking the plunge to avoid getting scammed, as a general rule the posts that spam up the forums are scams (e.g. Virwex).<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve got a question about Coinbase if anyone can help.<br /><br />What I did for my previous purchase of BTC was Bitinstant&gt;blockchain.info&gt;SR wallet. It worked well and quite speedy.<br /><br />However, found out about Coinbase recently and the fees and ease of buying BTC was attractive. I made an account and was playing around with it. What I plan to do is either:<br /><br />Option 1: Coinbase&gt;blockchain.ifo&gt;SR wallet<br />Option 2: Coinbase&gt;SR wallet<br /><br />My question is which option do you think would be best? Also, I cannot access Coinbase through Tor without enabling javascript. Should I turn on javascript?&nbsp; <br /><br />OR Will it then be a problem if I used a &quot;normal&quot; browser and logged into Coinbase and transfer BTC? Is it advisable to go from Coinbase&gt;SR without Tor? (After typing this out, it sounds ridiculously unsafe)<br />

				I agree. I&#039;m willing to spend a little extra to make sure it gets untraceable. I do moneygram to bitinstant to blockchain (anonymous) to bitcoin fog to SR. I think that&#039;s pretty good.

				You can get into extreme security regarding buying bitcoins anonymously but there isn&#039;t a cop out there who is going to spend the time and energy trying to track down who bought what bitcoins unless you are in a league like DPR running something like this site.

I know people who have been very careless with their BTC purchases.. and purchases 50k + in their own name. <br />Just set up a couple of road blocks (btc fog &amp; others alike) and you&#039;re fine.. <br /><br />Remember, if you were ever detained and questioned about anything!!! Don&#039;t crumble. Shut your mouth and get a lawyer. Don&#039;t listen to LE as they know how to manipulate the situation you&#039;re in to get your to talk!! <br /><br />OH and btw don&#039;t make double purchase of the same amount to the same address with Bitinstant. They have a fraud filter. I would only use bitinstant if I had multiple people making deposits and for under 500$ per person. Watch yaself
