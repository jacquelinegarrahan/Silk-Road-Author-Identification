				I&#039;ve have ran clen for bodybuilding purposes. The plan was to start out at 40mcg (microgram) and increase to 100mcg over the course of 3 wks a few days after 40mcg starting does I upped it to 60 that&#039;s when I decided to stop, I battle with anxity and clen definitely triggered that. I&#039;ve found that T3 (thyroid hormone) to be a much better route or me when cutting. I know of several guys who run t3 and clen together with excellent results. I do know of a very reputable research supply company that sales both excellent t3 and clen.

				my apologies. it&#039;s t3 that causes lactation. source can be googled as its everywhere. <br /><br />why not just juice to lose the weight? its fast and relatively healthy when compaired to other methods especially when your goal is to lose 80lbs.

Clen allows you to exercise some. And with diet, exercise and clen I imagine weight loss will be pretty quick, as for what anxiety... well. I also struggle with anxiety, but its used as a legit med for asthma in EU and I have asthma so its a plus. If i take it slow at first I&#039;m sure the anxiety will peel away.

				i did extensive research before ordering Clen and i ordered from Body in Action and received it in 16 days!!! i plan to start on the 1st, i found some weight loss sites that have how to cycle both the T3 and Clen for fast effective weight loss. But Body in Action was very professional when i got nervous when it was taking long to me(did not know it was coming from the mediterranean area) he reassured and responded promptly to all my messages.<br /><br />some sites that may help you on your weight loss journey <br /><br />http://www.steroidscycles.net/cutting-cycles/clenbuterol-fat-loss-cycle-for-men/<br /><br />https://clenbuterol4.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/correct-clenbutrol-dose-for-men/<br /><br />http://clenbuterolweightloss.blogetery.com/2012/08/21/clenbuterol-for-men-weight-loss/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
