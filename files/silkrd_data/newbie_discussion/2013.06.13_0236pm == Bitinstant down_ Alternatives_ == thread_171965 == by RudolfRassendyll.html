				Hello all<br />I have been trying to get a transaction going on bitinstant sporadically over the past 24 hours and keep getting a message saying:<br />&quot;We are having trouble with one of our partners. Please try again soon.&quot; or something close.<br /><br />Does anyone know what&#039;s up? Anyone successfully use bitinstant in the past day?<br /><br />I&#039;m sort of in need of BTC soon and bitinstant was in my comfort zone. I&#039;ve looked at a couple other options but scams are so common I&#039;m unsure. Anyone have any recommendations for reputable anonymous BTC services that utilize moneygram, western union, etc? There&#039;s a bank of america about 20 miles away... hesitant to drive all the way down but I heard there&#039;s a darknet way of using BOA to get btc? I&#039;m half-tempted to grab the old greendot moneypak but it seems like such a clear way to invite rip offs. <br /><br />Any info appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br />RR

				The problem is, you&#039;re trying to use the service as a guest. It didn&#039;t allow me to do that yesterday. You have to sign up and then have your identity verified. If you&#039;re using a fake name, they will generate questions based on the real person with that name. I was locked out for a week from one account by trying to guess the information of a fake person and somehow managed to guess the three questions correctly for another fake name...then it worked flawlessly. My advice is to try bitinstant again with a registered account. It will/should work.

				Thanks dude.<br />I don&#039;t see why they don&#039;t just say &quot;Please register&quot;, or disable the guest button completely if they are no longer accepting unregistered transactions. Telling me they are having problems with their partners or whatever is stupid; I&#039;m willing to register if they simply said &quot;register&quot;. <br /><br />Will give it a shot and report back. Did you use them with success recently? I&#039;ve read a few tidbits in other threads that say they are having problems this week but nothing definitive.<br /><br />Thanks

				Well, I registered and successfully created a payslip... but my comfort level with bitinstant has significantly decreased. I always figured using small amounts of coin/buying medication that improves my life would sort of let me off LEs long arm... but this is making it a bit easier for them. Quite a bit easier. Guess I&#039;ll have to use btc laundry and lose even more of my money... the anonymous factor is pretty much garbage at this point.

				Just remember, itsnot illegal to buy Bitcoins.&nbsp; Just be smart about how you tumble them.&nbsp; don&#039;t link your bitinstant account directly to the silkroad.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know anything about rerouting coins... I agree with you, I wish they would have just told me to register. I figured a fake name&#039;s question&#039;s out; there are only 3. You could just keep creating emails until you successfully guess the questions. However, the complete anonymity of BitInstant to SR is gone...unfortunately. I still don&#039;t see LE worrying much about people who use SR for personal use and not trying to turn a profit. Safety is great because it lessens the risk for everyone involved, but I wouldn&#039;t be TOO concerned about sending bitcoins to a bitwallet address...

				I used bitinstant last night around 7pm, still no deposit into my bit coin wallet....first time they haven&#039;t been in the account in a timely fashion.<br /><br />I emailed bitinstant and they got back to me so hopefully this gets figured out soon.
