				I am offering a very favorable deal to my first five customers. I am attempting to start up a BTC exchange service. I have offered a 15% bonus up to $50 to my first 5 customers. Anyone interested have a look at my vendor page. PM me on the main site with any questions or buy my listing and we can get to work on betting you some free Bitcoins.

				I think with this service you&#039;ll have to be very patient, it takes a long time to gain respect and a good reputation.<br /><br />Your offer does seem good but it&#039;ll take time for people to be confident in using your service, 15% bonus means shit if you&#039;re gonna take the money and run. <br /><br />Obviously not implying you will or anything but this is how I see it, it&#039;s not that it isn&#039;t a good offer but enticing people with monetary rewards can seem a little scammy. Maybe focus on being fast, reliable and trustworthy?<br /><br />My thoughts anyway- All the best!

				That is of course the plan and the 15% incentive is only to get my first few transactions done and establish my reputation.<br /><br />The other part of the offer is that I am willing to do repeated transactions in $50 increments. So the buyer never has more than $50+a $5 Western Union fee at risk at any time. Basically if a customer wanted to transfer $200, they would start by sending $50 and I would travel to the WU and verify that it got sent, then travel home and transfer their coins. After that we would repeat the same process 3 more times.. The customer gets to do all this from the comfort of their computer while I am busting back and forth to maintain their security of never having more than $55 at risk at any one time.<br /><br />The 15% bonus more than covers the fees so they come out ahead in the end and I have been offering transactions at the Mt.Gox rate so I am offering a favorable exchange rate as well!

				Yeah man, even with your 15% discount. Being forced to have transactions of $50. The fees are going to be around 10% of each one, giving only an actual 5% incentive to trust your money to a stranger. You may wanna go back to the marketing drawing board mate.

				Hey Mate!<br /><br />A few things:<br />1.&nbsp; Your listing is slightly cryptic, lacking information &amp; may be confusing to your potential customers.&nbsp; I understand English might be your second language, but it might be worth getting some assistance in writing a better &#039;copy&#039; for your vending page.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Is there a possibility that what you are trying to do is not allowed on SilkRoad?&nbsp; From how I understand what you are trying to do you would be voiding this rule:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br /><br />&quot;Below is a short list of specific things you should avoid. It is by no means exhaustive, but taking any one of these actions could get your seller priviledges revoked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Directing customers to pay outside the escrow system or in currencies other than Bitcoin &quot;<br /><br />I think requesting money through WU is breaking this rule.<br /><br />Perhaps get in contact with a site admin to confirm?&nbsp; I&#039;d hate for you to lose your vendor account + bond.<br /><br />Anyway, hope you find a business that works for you :)<br /><br />

The $50 transactions are a means to protect the customer so they only have $50 at risk at any one time and do not have to trust me on any amount greater than that. If they chose to do $50 then $150, or just the $200 right off the bat, no problem. But 10% of $200 is $20 and 10% of $50 x 4 is $20 so the fees are the same either way. That&#039;s the way percentages work. The customer will not have to spend any additional fees in either case and because of the bonus I am paying those fees. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah man, even with your 15% discount.

While they do not recommend it because of the risks involved and because of the lack of escrow protection. Which are real risks, don&#039;t get me wrong. I want any potential customers to know up front that I understand why there is uncertainty in this transaction. But that is why I am offering to do it in pieces for anyone to minimize the risk on their end. It is a lot of extra work for me, but well worth it to provide as much security as possible.<br /><br />

				Get rid of the &#039;free money&#039; campaign- It screams scam. <br /><br />Advertise &#039;no commission&#039; instead, or low commission.<br /><br />(If there&#039;s no commission people might wonder why you&#039;re doing it (scam?), low commission shows your intentions are legit and that it&#039;s still a good deal).<br /><br />My thoughts anyway...pinch of salt an all that.<br /><br />There was another btc exhange on here (BitcoinsUK) that offered commission free exchanges to get started, it seemed to work for him.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice. I suppose I can see where it might sound &#039;too good to be true&#039; but all the better for the few folks who decide to work with me. Then anyone who didn&#039;t trust missed out on the deal. No big deal though because after this I intend to offer very low fees for the first 25-50 transactions before raising it slightly until I have 150 -200 transactions...<br /><br />So everyone will have the chance to use my service at low cost, only the first few will get free money on top of their order.

He changed up his MO slightly in order to accommodate me , AND , gave me the best rate I&#039;ve ever got buying bitcoins, PLUS, I got a little xtra bonus for being his 1st cusatomer . I took a chance on Chang, an untested vendor because I had a good gut feeling bout em, and my gut feeling was right on the money,,,,,this time. <br />Chang is a straight shooter, he was a pleasure to do business with and I would not hesitate to do business with him again. <br />Now, if I were anyone else reading this review, I&#039;d be thinkin,&quot; of course he was, you were his 1st customer&quot; . That is true, but, you get a feel for people and I just got the feeling this dude is a straight shooter with integrity. Just trying to offer a service at a much more than fair price . I mean, cmon guys, I got free money. <br />Communications - 10/5<br />Speed - 10/5<br />I don&#039;t know what else to rate as there is no product or shipping to critique, but I wouldn&#039;t hesitate for a moment to use Chang again .<br />Thnx Dude, you came thru for me in a big way today.

				I&#039;m happy to say that Chang&#039;s business is legit! Quick service, extra cherry on top for being one of the first customers. I believe I found my go-to guy when it comes to getting some Bitcoins. We have joint venture.
