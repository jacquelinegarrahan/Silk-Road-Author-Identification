				I&#039;ve been waiting for my MDMA since 23th of June. It&#039;s been sooo long, I sent him 3 messages. One of them 4 days ago, another 2 days ago, and one just now. He replied none of them. They are still bold, so it seems like he didn&#039;t even read them. I only got 4 days till auto-finalize :S He said something like this on his vendor page: &quot; I haven&#039;t been able to reply to messages for 3 days, but I will by the end of Saturday&quot; And still, I&#039;m worried because it&#039;s Sunday afternoon now. We are in the same time-zone too, so it was an inside EU order. <br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. He really seemed like a nice guy and excellent vendor... He got so many nice feedbacks too...Any thought on this, guys??

				(Only) day 2 and no response, still processing. I sure hope he&#039;ll make it, cause I need the blotters for next Thursday... so that will leave me one week to order and get it from someone else, if I count the cancellation time :(

				Only did one transaction with him (~2 weeks ago) , but it went through flawlessly. Pro shipment, good LSD just around the advertised strength. Good shipping time, and friendly no-bullshit communications. I&#039;ll shop there again.

				He&#039;s a pretty busy vendor, I would imagine if he couldn&#039;t reply to PM&#039;s he would end up with 100+ over a few days.<br /><br /><br /><br />Has he talked to you yet?

And yes he has, it&#039;s in the resolution center now. We agreed on a reship two weeks ago, but it still hasn&#039;t arrived. I placed the order over a month ago, it&#039;s really frustrating. I have been receiving other orders since, one from the same country he&#039;s shipping from so I just can&#039;t understand why this one is taking so long... :-\

Or are there other European(but not Dutch) vendors who have decent MDMA?
