				hi. i just noticed a new vendor claiming to sell real deal pre ban meph. pics and description looks legit. anyone tried? i am now 100% sure that the rest products listed as meph on silk road are NOT 4-mmc, but this guys listings looks tempting. his address: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/65989d64b1&nbsp; &nbsp;username: masterpiece

				I&#039;m skeptical since real 4-mmc is so rare.&nbsp; Those prices aren&#039;t very good for a trial since chances are it isn&#039;t real 4-mmc.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of good feedback on SR but most vendors selling cathinones mislabeled as 4-mmc yet good reviews there.<br /><br />If you try it then please report back though.&nbsp; If it is the real thing but I&#039;ll be just as happy as anyone.

				I´ve tried a couple of vendors &quot;meph&quot; but it all seems like mixed cathinones (wertus stuff was quite nice).<br />But this vendors pic looked just to tempting so I ordered 2g.. <br /><br />will update about the product as soon as it arrives, I will probably shit my pants of pure joy if it really is meph. It was way too long ago I had the real deal (2010)..<br /><br />

				I just took a closer look at the pic and I now see that the product is rice-like shards.&nbsp; 4-mmc doesn&#039;t form into rice-like shards but other cathinones such as 4-mec do.

				It is common for SR to have good reviews for cathinones sold as mephedrone.&nbsp; The other cathinones definitely have stimulant effects but it isn&#039;t anything close to mephedrone.&nbsp; Reading through all of the reviews there are a few people that say it isn&#039;t meph.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the Full Escrow UK comes back with whatever he had.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t real meph then it is the closest thing I&#039;ve found and I like it.

				Yeah. I expect it&#039;ll be something else, but if it&#039;s still good then I&#039;m ok with that. While it&#039;d be ideal to get real mephedrone, I&#039;m happy with a decent substitute.

				got the package finally, (Norway) sadly I can´t test it until saturday/sunday, but the crystals looks a bit 4mec-ish.. sadly enough..<br /><br />I´ll update in the weekend after some testing.<br /><br /><br />it will either be a WOOHOO! or a buhu..<br />

				sorry to say this but it was a <br />BUHU...<br /><br />probably 4-mec mixed with some other cathinone.<br />nice buzz though but the effects lasted no longer that 25-30 min.<br /><br />didnt get to do more than about 1g cause i accidentally dropped the bag on the carpet.. <br />but that maybe was a good thing..
