				Hi all,<br />So I have a customer who is wanting me to ship to him using his first name and last initial. I have warned him that his package might not be delivered due to using an incomplete name. He insists that he has done it before and that he has gotten packages this way. But his stats read:<br /><br />Total transactions: 5<br />Total spent: $118.35<br />Refund rate: 11.51%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 month<br /><br />To me the refund rate shows that he may not indeed be receiving all his packages after all. I&#039;m a new vendor and I&#039;m pretty proud of the fact that 100% of my packages have reached their destinations. I think I would be covered in any dispute due to the fact that I provide tracking and I do have proof that I have warned him against this. However, even though I take very careful precautions of leaving no evidence in or on the package that could lead anyone to me, I do not want an undelivered package going under postal scrutiny. Well anyways, I thought I would post this and see what all of you think.

				Sounds like the guy thinks he will be able to hide behind the fact that it wasn&#039;t his full name. <br /><br />In a nice polite way, tell him he is stupid.

				I&#039;ve done this for domestic and international and either first name or last name without a problem.

				Point taken Jack, but like&nbsp; Lysergix implied, only listing a last initial would not protect you much from any LE I would imagine. So what is the point of only using a last initial? I would love to provide my customers with as much freedom and security as possible but I see this as more of a risk for them and me than it is a benefit of any kind.
