				Used to hate the guy, always bringing me bills and notices. Now that I found the road, he brings me good shit too. I&#039;ll have to slip him a $50 for the holidays. ;)

				I&#039;ve definitely developed a different view of the mailman since I found The Road. Now whenever i see a mailman (or mailwoman) i wanna high five em.<br /><br />I know my own postie&#039;s schedule back to front, and I even know that if it&#039;s a wet day he&#039;ll be 30-40 min behind schedule.<br /><br />god bless the working man

				Hell yes. We have a regular guy half the week and the other half dozy trainees or something. Had an order running late a few weeks ago, my friend was getting half and he was camped out at my house most of the day. Usual time for post is 12.30 but by 3pm he had us out in the car driving around looking for him. When we found him it was a full on stalking session. Never came either. Try another 7 days later. When orders are late, its tense. Its the only time I really keep look out for him. But fuck that stalking shit, thats my paranoid buddy. He is funny though&nbsp; ;D

				O yes the mailman my new love. On the days I&#039;m expecting a package I usually camp my window and seeing that yellow car pulling up in front of my house is such a fucking rush, really. And hearing that sound of mail dropping in is just the best. Every time it happens I fucking shoot out of my coach in a millisecound and rush to see what has dropped in.

				Yes, and I think the mailman is starting to think I&#039;m crazy because I&#039;m always there waiting. I have spend entire weeks chain smoking on my porch from 2 to 5 pm just waiting in hopes that my drugs have arrived.

				my postman brought me a jiffy bag containing 1.2g of weed today, not enough to raise eyebrows I know but to me (an ex addict who smoked upto 7g a day) it was very welcome and just enough to keep my demons at bay until the next time.<br /><br />Thank you mr postman.<br /><br />
