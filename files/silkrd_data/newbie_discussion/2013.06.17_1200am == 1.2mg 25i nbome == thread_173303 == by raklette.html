				hello everyone,<br /><br />As I type this, I am coming down from a fantastic 1.2 mg nbome trip as supplied by BlockBuster. This is my fourth time doing these bad boys (dosing of first two unknown) and I think it is time that they get a review from me.<br /><br />So the 1.2 mgs are fantastic. Like, wow. You go completely insane and you see a million colours and you are bathing in the colours of the rainbow. It is very euphoric, very strong physical high as well. And at 1.2 mg. Very fucking emotional. I am talking crying into my hands because of how beautiful a song is. Or just imagining myself locking up the doors, looking after my family, kissing everyone good night - that made me sob like a lunatic.<br /><br />So my day was as follows<br />3.00 p.m. - I am in a clean room, candles lit, heater on. Gums brushed, I insert the tabs that I split in two on both sides of my mouth. I hold on. Remembering not to swallow. and reasoning with myself why I shouldn&#039;t be swwallowing. I am the sort of man that googles the calorie content of the food he&#039;s munching on at that very moment. So I am googling and reading &#039;swallowing saliva 25i nbome&#039; related posts on the internet.<br /><br />3.50 - I can&#039;t really hold it in much longer. There is at least 250 mls worth of saliva in my mouth and I just want to swallow. So I do. Hello :). I am sitting on the loo, looking at my hands. Lady gaga is playing in the background. I can see the blood flow through my veins on the surface of my skin. I am loving it. I always smile to myself when I trip. So I am smiling. I wipe, flush, leave and go or a walk.<br /><br />I walk outside. Walk about 4 metres. Look at some flowers. The sun, sky. Bees flying by are like what you&#039;d see on a good quality HD screen demo TV. very nice. I love god, nature and what he&#039;s done. This whole time I am questioning the connection between natural things and man made things. Very difficult to comprehend my thoughts.&nbsp; I chicken out. walk back. Mess around the house and pester a housemate to lend me his speakers. I go back to my room and LOSE MY FUCKING MIND.<br /><br />4.30 p.m. - I love all sorts of music. So I went back and forth between genres. I don&#039;t really listen to much electronic music. So I threw in some folk and other stuff. This drug, is very FUCKING GOOD for the appreciation of music. if you are ever unsure of an album. Just get these bad boys and put your headphones on. All the musos out there will love this too. I liek to journal/scrible on a notebook when I&#039;m tripping. I also like to walk around my room, stare at things ( I collect funny looking knick knacks so its AWESOME!!!) So I go back and forth around the room scribbling stuff like - <br /><br />&quot;feeling a little bit insane right now&quot;<br /><br />&quot;crossing the boundaries of textbook descriptions of cellular motion&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I am showered in rainbows&quot;<br /><br />I guess that sort of sums up how I feel.<br /><br />at 1.2mg I just go through at least 2 hours of losing my mind to music and my emotions are amplified. I cry, I laugh. I dance - I feel like a child and I feel completely insane. The colors are magnificent. the shapes of the visuals are so wonderfully elaborate and with all the sensory overload you just don&#039;t know how to feel.<br /><br />Insane. that is the only way I can describe it. and I love it. For me, the chaos/trippyness that comes with these bad boys is what I described as <br /><br />&quot;everything&quot;<br /><br />I was talking to my friend on the phone, and she agreed thata on&nbsp; nbomes, you feel everything. happy/scared/angryblablala.. a rush of emotions, ar<br /><br />The peak which comes at the 2 hour mark and lasts up to the 4 hour mark is just remarkably great because you are couch locked, seeing stars and feeling a fantastic body load all at once. Sensory overload at it&#039;s best. Like being fucked by a giant cock in EVERY SINGLE CELL OF YOUR BODY.<br /><br />My soul was deeply massaged. Thanks to good music, 25i nbome.<br /><br />My apptetite is insane on this though.<br /><br />So at the 3 hour mark I get my sister to come over. I am a little bit anxious.... somehow I think the visuals are affected by your level of consciousness. It&#039;s a very controllable high after the 3 hour mark. <br /><br />6.30 - My sister comes over while I am on the phone talking shit.She tells me I sound very stupid. I put the phone down and look at her face... I will never look at her when I am tripping again!<br /><br />We hang around, I introduce her to some of my music. I am still seeing all these shapes float all across the room. I then ask her to lend me her Ipad. I watched music videos. These 3 music videos blew my mind and I recommend anyone tripping to watch them<br />Lady Gaga&#039;s&nbsp; Romance and <br />Tame Impala&#039;s Elephant <br />Tane Impala&#039;s Feels like we only go backwards<br /><br />I ate a bit at this point and chocolate tastes EXCELLENT on 25i nbome :). Unfortunately the insanity dies down after a while....visuals are less intense. But they do come up every once in a while. which is pretty much the nature of the high that you get from 25i nbome. It comes in waves, and if i&#039;m not wrong it follows the circulation of blood within your body.<br /><br />my 4th time round had a shorter peak, I suspect it is due to my tolerance.<br /><br />2.00 a.m. And it is just swirly lights all throughout the night... until you take benzo. and feel your body slowly shut down.<br /><br />enjoy your nbomes people. I did. :)<br />
