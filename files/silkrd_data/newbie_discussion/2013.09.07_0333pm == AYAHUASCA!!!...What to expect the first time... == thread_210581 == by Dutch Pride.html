				I am often asked what drinking ayahuasca is like, not only by people who know very little about it but also by people who have read about it or have seen videos about it but have yet to try it. I usually respond that it is a lot like asking someone what sex is like before you’ve lost your virginity. It’s difficult to describe. I do think that there are a few things that someone could expect the first time drinking ayahuasca. But, just as with a first sexual experience, there are many factors involved and those factors greatly influence the perceptions and feelings involved in the experience.<br /><br />Of course, one important factor is the ayahuasca itself. Because ayahuasca can be prepared in many different ways, the particular method of cooking and ingredients in the brew can produce a wide variety of different sensations and effects. There are even different kinds of ayahuasca vine, the one consistent ingredient in the brew, which produce singular effects as well. This may seem like the most important factor, but I think that too much attention is given to the chemistry of the brew. Ayahuasca is a medicine, but it is not like the medicines with which the western world is familiar. The science of medicine within which ayahuasca is used, called curanderismo, is also quite different from the western world. In curanderismo, the spirit, not the chemical composition, of a plant is what heals an illness. The doctor, or curandero, connects and communicates with these spirits to help cure a patient, so ayahuasca can best be considered as a key to open that connection. What you do with it is the determining factor in the healing process.<br /><br />I think that new forms of healing practices will be developed due to pioneers exploring their own way of doing things. Of course, if you are looking to be healed it would probably be best to seek out a true healer. Imagine needing surgery and trying to do it yourself with no guidance. While the patient in need of healing plays a much bigger role in the healing process within curanderismo than in western medicine, the curandero still plays the central role. Not everyone drinks ayahuasca for the same reason, though.<br /><br />This leads me to what I feel is the most important factor, which is the way you feel about the experience going into it. If you are in need of healing and excited to drink because you know that it will help you find the solutions to your problems, then your experience will most likely be more beneficial than if you are doubtful that drinking is a good idea and are fearful that bad things might happen to you. If you are drinking with a guide you trust in a place where you feel safe, obviously your experience will be better than if you are drinking with someone you don’t trust in a place where you don’t feel safe. These are very basic examples of what is actually a much deeper and more complicated topic, but basically, I feel that you determine your own experience more than anything, or anyone else. Controlling that experience can be quite difficult, however, as it means controlling who you are, how you feel, and what you think, which is a real challenge.<br /><br />So, with all that said, I think this was supposed to be about what to expect the first time you drink ayahuasca. I hope, by now, you see how difficult it is to describe, but I will do my best. Let me just say one more thing, which is that I am basing my descriptions on my personal journeys with ayahuasca and conversations about the experiences of the many participants of the retreats and courses that I lead for the Ayahuasca Foundation. All of these experiences over the years have always been led by skilled curanderos in ceremonies at jungle camps in the Amazon Rainforest of Peru. Ceremonies have always been in the dark and surrounded by a multitude of plants. I have led over thirty retreats and courses and have drank ayahuasca over five hundred times, but I am still just doing my best to describe what is, often times, simply indescribable. Ok, here goes…<br /><br /><br /><br />There is usually some anxiety prior to drinking, as we never know how things will go. It can also be exciting for the same reason. When the brew actually does reach our lips, it has a peculiar flavor and can often burn a bit as it goes down. That burning sensation can then be felt spreading throughout the body. Often times it is subtle, but due to the combination of anxiety and excitement we are often more aware of sensations. We most likely will notice that we have begun to sweat, and there will be an unusual sensation in the stomach that is neither painful nor pleasant. The burning and sweating will subside, or at least become less noticeable, but the feeling in the stomach will most likely persist. Minutes pass by rather normally before the actual effects of the ayahuasca, rather than the effects of our own reaction to drinking, begin to change our perceptions.<br /><br />Our thoughts often become more rapid and somewhat scattered, with more than one line of thinking taking place at the same time, but not in a panicked way, just like hearing two or three people speaking at the same time. Our heart rate gets a bit faster too (it is not a good idea to drink ayahuasca if you have any heart problems) and tingling feelings become perceptible on the interior of different parts of our body, including our head. It is not uncommon to hear an electric hum as our brain activity increases along with our sensory abilities, most especially our hearing. As our eyesight becomes more sensitive, allowing us to see beyond the normally visible spectrum, we begin to see colors and flashes of light. These colors take form into patterns as our consciousness slips into what could be described as a trance state. It is during this state that the majority of the experience takes place.<br /><br />The passing of consciousness into a different state can be accompanied by very unusual sensations, including nausea or physical discomfort, but usually pass as the trance state becomes more established. However, it is not uncommon to vomit at this time. Being unaccustomed to the sensation, our bodies react in different ways. Vomiting does not immediately stop the sensations, but they will diminish more quickly than if you don’t vomit. The peak of the trance will often be accompanied by strong visions, meaning that beyond just patterns there will be dreamlike sequences or recognizable entities, spirits, that may even interact directly with us. Our thoughts may seem much clearer, realizing important information and ways to achieve our goals or find satisfaction in life. We may observe that voices of spirits are telling us this information or showing it to us in visions. After the peak, the visions begin to fade and are usually replaced by pleasant emotions and physical fatigue. Our mind continues to remain connected to spirit even after the visions subside, although it is more subtle. Usually, we sleep very well after an ayahuasca ceremony, once we calm down from reviewing all that happened during the experience.<br />Now for the exceptions…<br /><br />Each mind-body connection works differently from another, so while the above scenario might be a typical response to drinking ayahuasca, there are many atypical responses as well. The most common atypical response is to not have any sensation at all, as if the brew were merely an unpleasant drink with no effect. That may be the case but more likely is that your natural defenses denied the effect, preventing the ayahuasca from working. Our fear, anxiety, or mind set can have a tremendous power over what we do and don’t perceive and sense. On the other end of the spectrum, the visions could be overwhelming and incapacitating, causing many sessions of vomiting and uncontrolled emotions. I’m sure some people reading this would disagree and say, ‘that is not what happened when I drank.’ Like I said, it is not easy to describe. Really, the entire spectrum of experiences is possible from crying the whole time in fear to smiling the whole time in joy. So, am I saying that it could be a wonderful experience, a terrible experience, or no experience at all? Well…. Yes. That’s just the way it is. But there are a few things that could improve the odds of it being wonderful.<br /><br />I think the most important tip is to keep your vibrations high. Love is the highest vibration, so when you drink the brew and are waiting for the effects, start to think about all the people that you love, all the things you love to do, places you love to visit, etc. Say thank you to those people, to the Earth, to the plants and animals, realize and show your appreciation for the miracle of life. Basically, put yourself in the most positive and pleasing mindset possible before the effects set in.<br /><br />Put your faith in ayahuasca. Know that it will help you, that the guide will protect you, that you will be healed, that you will find the answers you seek. The more faith the better. Having faith is the best way of summing up the right attitude and mindset to drink ayahuasca. Be confident knowing that the spirits will do what’s best for you, that God will show you the way, that everything is meant to be, that it’s all good.<br /><br />Don’t be afraid. Fear is a very low vibration and also contradicts faith. I have heard the phrase ‘I’m a god fearing man’ as a way of saying that someone is good but I definitely don’t agree. I don’t fear my father. On the contrary, I love him. And I love God. So, keep fear out of your experience. Even if you have visions of things that might be frightening, be strong and know that you will prevail. You are divine. Divine beings have no fear. Divine beings are made of love. We are all divine. We are made of love.<br /><br />Of course, there are some basics that should be covered, like feeling safe in your environment and with the person or people who will be drinking with you. I think it’s best to be in a dark space, the closer to nature the better, where you won’t be disturbed. There are dietary restrictions that are now well known and the rest of the basics seem to be more readily available for people seeking an ayahuasca experience. What I tried to provide here is a bit more than the basics, but also what I’ve found to be the most important. Does it matter if you have fried chicken the day you drink ayahuasca? Not nearly as much as your personal energy, attitude, and mindset.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				You should not expect your third eye to open, but it will create some DMT and sometimes it can take you into other dimensions outside of your fysical body, insida I should say since you got a universe inside youre third eye.<br /><br />I wish more people could activate their third eye instead of lookin for stuff to make it happen without opening the third eye fully.<br /><br />I can leave my fysical body and fly anywhere and remote view anything.. <br /><br />You could never do that thru drugs you can only do hat by activating your third eye thru meditating and stop the poisoning of your own body by eating right and clean foods.<br /><br />We are just searchin for whats inside of our third eye since there is some real powers in it and humans are sungods and we can fly and stuff since we have a bunch of different energybodies on top of our fysical body and I doubt you can use any of them energybodies thru using drugs, meditating makes your pineal gland produce DMT on demand, myself I think the drugs forces the pineal to create DMT constantly until the high wears off..<br /><br />think about it.<br /><br />Take care man and good luck

				very true, but most of us aren&#039;t that far yet. and i strongly believe that these plants are here for a reason, it&#039;s not a drug...it&#039;s a medicine...and it would seem too much of a coincidence that these plants have these &#039;powers&#039; to ignore it.<br /><br />i also meditate, but i have yet to come remotely close to what dmt brings me.<br /><br />each his own i guess...<br /><br />DP

				Trust me, you just have to manifest it by writing it down so you can see the words, then you will get what you want..<br /><br />I wrote everything I want down and 2 days later I was remote viewing the kitchen because I woke up in bed outside of my fysical body and the 2 people in my bed said something about smoke or fog and it looked kinda foggy so I jumped over the unknown people in my bed and flew out into the kitchen and looked into the oven because i was shure something was burning becaue of the the foggyness, then when I was lookin into theoven I started to think what the hell am I doing here, then I jolted back into my fysical body and I was alone in my bed like wtf who was those two people sitting there saying its smoke in here hahahaa damn enteties or demons or what the hell we should call them, or maybe i know then I dont know but they was here tho when I got outside of my fysical body.<br /><br />You will never be able to do stuff like that using drugs so I suggest you write stuff down and I promise you things will happen.<br /><br />

				I would say it like one of the best comedians of all time said it, Doug Stanhope..<br /><br />He said -if you want to see all the lies in society, then try psycadelic drugs..<br /><br />So be aware about that and if you want to continue to be a docile happy slave in today society it might not be the best idea to try psycadelics because you will start noticing who is bullshitting all the time and who the slaveowners are.<br /><br />

It&#039;s just feel wrong to me selling Ayahuasca to inexperienced users and could be very very dangerous.<br />I think that it is a very bad idea to drink Ayahuasca without a shamanic guide. I don&#039;t consider it as a trip but rather a journey, and shamans who had been to these journeys many times, can prepare you the best for it.<br />It&#039;s the last thing you would want to drink with your friends outside in a park or a forest... who wants to keep an eye on his friend while he&#039;s puking on himself, moving, talking and acting like he&#039;s in another world for like 12 hours? sure not me... and I&#039;m sure that a bad Ayahuasca journey that happened because bad set and setting is 1000000000 times worse than bad LSD trip.<br /><br />I must mention that I&#039;ve yet to try Ayahuasca (smoking DMT yes) but since I&#039;ve read so much about it I know that it&#039;s something very serious that you&#039;ll never forget. Also, after the many visions that I&#039;ve seen of my own future while smoking Salvia Divinorum with my friends, I realized that these plants are not a child&#039;s play at all. When you are exposed to this Divinity, Truth, Sanctity or whatever you wanna call it, sometimes you don&#039;t know how to handle it and accept it, and IMO, that is the biggest reason why people have bad experiences.<br /><br /><br />I find psychedelics are like martial arts - when you&#039;re apprentice you always need your master to guide you, until you become the master - The Shaman. But even the shamans need a guide from their master - The Grandmaster - GOD.<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM

It&#039;s just feel wrong to me selling Ayahuasca to inexperienced users and could be very very dangerous.<br />I think that it is a very bad idea to drink Ayahuasca without a shamanic guide. I don&#039;t consider it as a trip but rather a journey, and shamans who had been to these journeys many times, can prepare you the best for it.<br />It&#039;s the last thing you would want to drink with your friends outside in a park or a forest... who wants to keep an eye on his friend while he&#039;s puking on himself, moving, talking and acting like he&#039;s in another world for like 12 hours? sure not me... and I&#039;m sure that a bad Ayahuasca journey that happened because bad set and setting is 1000000000 times worse than bad LSD trip.<br /><br />I must mention that I&#039;ve yet to try Ayahuasca (smoking DMT yes) but since I&#039;ve read so much about it I know that it&#039;s something very serious that you&#039;ll never forget. Also, after the many visions that I&#039;ve seen of my own future while smoking Salvia Divinorum with my friends, I realized that these plants are not a child&#039;s play at all. When you are exposed to this Divinity, Truth, Sanctity or whatever you wanna call it, sometimes you don&#039;t know how to handle it and accept it, and IMO, that is the biggest reason why people have bad experiences.<br /><br /><br />I find psychedelics are like martial arts - when you&#039;re apprentice you always need your master to guide you, until you become the master - The Shaman. But even the shamans need a guide from their master - The Grandmaster - GOD.<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for your message do i think you are wrong on many accounts...<br />People should not be affraid to take ayahuasca at all!&nbsp; Yes ofcourse you should do as much research as you can before taking it, but if we are all restricted to using ayahuasca only with a shaman, then there would not be enough shamans around the meet the demand.<br />I know for sure it&#039;s a lot more dangerous to drink alcohol than it would be taking ayahuasca...you can check your local newspaper for that..<br />And if you are a group of close friends who care about one and other, then drinking in a forest is a wonderfull idea...you might want to try it before having such an outspoken opinion...i can also say (and i know a lot of people who have done it) that by far the majority of people that have drank it amongst friends or alone in a room have had great experiences and would recommand it to all...<br /><br />Ofcourse it would be more special when done in a traditional setting in the amazon, but that does not mean we should put people off when they feel they can do it their way...this brew does not discriminate because there is no shaman present.<br /><br />this brew should be treated with care and respect...but should not be labeled as dangerous or harmfull...<br /><br />DP

				I have to agree with DP on his last message.<br /><br />If you can afford a shaman that should an advantage, but if not, that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t do it. <br />Of course I wouldn&#039;t suggest anyone to try it alone like smoking DMT.<br /><br />But if you are going to do it with friends who are serious about this experience that might be even better than a shaman. At least that&#039;s my opinion and let me explain where I base this.<br /><br />When people are talking about spirits and etc, I can&#039;t really understand that. In my point of view I don&#039;t see or feel spirits but instead energy. The shaman who &quot;controls&quot; those spirits doesn&#039;t do anything different than vibrating with positive energy towards you. And when you are with friends who knows you better and how your body and mind reacts in different circumstances, you already have a shaman with you who is here to help you. Plus when you do it with friends the connection between you and them is stronger. The shaman is your guide, your healer. But your friend has some more elements that make the connection stronger.<br /><br />I believe that the whole procedure is based on the mind set, you can have a shaman and feel really guided and protected. But the same feelings can be achieved with when you do it amongst friends. Plus the little fact that your friends knows you personally and maybe they are capable of manipulating your fears/anxieties easier.<br /><br />Still, if you can afford going into the deep forest finding a shaman, do it this way and take one two friends with you. If you can&#039;t afford the trip into the Amazon, don&#039;t hesitate to do it with friends. Just don&#039;t rush on it unprepared.<br /><br />Lastly, because DutchPride made a metaphor with the first time having sex, I want also to make one similar.<br />If your first time is with a sex expert you will probably have a mind blowing sex experience. But then, if you do it with someone who has not experience like you, your first time may be very passionate, challenging without the element of teacher-student which is purer..<br /><br />Maybe I am wrong, but that is my opinion anyway.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				The main difference between Ayahuasca and DMT is, with Ayahuasca there is a pretty nasty purge phase.<br />Not nice by all accounts .<br />DMT is the extracted psycadelic molecule from the same plant , without the impurities to make you feel unwell.<br /><br />Same effect but if you want the full experience , chucking up and shittin yourself bash on ....<br /><br />DMT for me...

				Dear Dutch Pride and dear adamiz,<br /><br />What about the &quot;MAOI diet&quot;? From What I&#039;ve read MAOI can cause a lot of completely harmless foods to become very dangerous and lead even to death. So dangerous that the diet should apply 2-3 days before the ayahuasca journey and 2-3 days after. It&#039;s very serious issue!<br />Think about all the people that are going to order ayahuasca because they think it&#039;s fun, hallucinations, hanging out and joking with friends and drink it without reading all these warnings and only god knows what could happen... <br />There are tons of people who are in no way connected to their spirituality, 0%, that like psychedelics because they are junkies and like to get wasted and they do psychedelics in parties - for fun or while driving a car - for fun or while walking on a busy traffic main street - for fun. If they will put their hands on ayahuasca they will do it in the most inappropriate places not even a forest or at home.<br />That&#039;s something you should consider before you start spreading ayahuasca to everyone.<br />That&#039;s exactly what the shamans teach you - that it&#039;s not something for fun. In addition, they know that every person that travel so far to South America to their distant tribe - is a serious person that know why he came there and know that it&#039;s not for fun.<br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard about &quot;Shimbre&quot;, why do you think so many people travel there to drink ayahuasca with Rob? They can just do it in their house, don&#039;t they? :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t have anything else to add, it will just be so sad for me to hear on the news something like : &quot;...the bodies of the 4 missing guys were found in a forest. The autopsy has revealed that they consumed the illegal hallucinogenic substance DMT...&quot; :( :( :(<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM

				hi there, thank you for your concern.<br />the diet is important indeed, but it&#039;s not the foods that are extremely dangerous.<br />it&#039;s taking certain meds in combination with ayahuasca that is harmfull, but that is the case with almost any substance (alcohol in combination with drugs/meds is ten times more harmfull)<br /><br />obviously people have some responsebility them selves and as i say in the ad: do your research!<br /><br />any drug/substance sold on sr comes with a &#039;manual&#039;...we cannot blame the vendors for people who o.d. on heroin or rob a post office on crack.<br /><br />we all are responseble for our actions or lack of actions.<br /><br />DP

				Hi BPM. Glad to hear your opinion as well. <br /><br />Good job mentioning about the MAOI diet. I tend sometimes to forget details assuming that people knows or do their research before actually trying it. Everyone is different and I keep forgetting that. There are people who act like &quot;junkies&quot; as you say and want to take anything they come across&nbsp; without even knowing about the substance they are going to take. Maybe I am a bit extreme, but until now I spend a lot of time doing a good research before trying a substance. It took me over a year before trying LSD, DMT and even cannabis. I guess I wanted to know before. If everyone acted it this way less people would be in a bad position. <br /><br />Anyway. Ayahuasca is indeed a potion that you should be prepared before trying it and we should mention it. Not only mentally as we have said but also physically. The diet before and after is really important! There are plenty of links throughout the internet for anyone to search.<br /><br />In my previous post when I talked about the comparison about a shaman and friends, I was talking about the psychological (or spiritual if you wish) part. And one word that I wanted to emphasize but I couldn&#039;t cause I type and not talk was the word &quot;serious&quot;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But if you are going to do it with friends who are serious about this experience...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I guess I should have written it with capital letters :)<br /><br />In bottom line, I believe that people who are curious about substances and especially psychedelics ones, do their research before taking them. But again, we as a community have also to be part of warning others on the safety and everything.<br /><br />So, as I have said many times before: Be careful, have knowledge and above all respect the substances you are about to take.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Selling this is a ridiculous and bad idea. Without experience and without good guidance drinking something that contains MAIO inhibitors is like asking for the worst trip of your life. I really think you might sell a few drinks but i think that you will have no returning customers.<br />Ayahuasca is not for everybody and if its not for you , then you will have serious problems while tripping.<br />But of course everyone can do what ever one wants. I still think that an serious ceremony is important for this to work positive.<br />The energy of the people preparing will stick to the brew and its clear that this is all about money. Not good.<br /><br />I would really think about it because its not just chemicals your messing with DP! , you might send people to the psychiatric station with this.<br /><br />peace

Not good.<br /><br />I would really think about it because its not just chemicals your messing with DP! , you might send people to the psychiatric station with this.<br /><br />peace<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with you. Ayahuasca is not for everybody and I think too, that customers will not buy it again after the 1st time. Drugs like Ayahuasca or Ibogaine are not recreational drugs like the majority of the drugs and most importantly, not addictive (The opposite is right with Ibogaine :) ) . I will be surprised to hear about people that do such drugs regularly for recreational use.<br />At least DP should bless every customer with positive energy and pray for him that he will go through that journey well. :)<br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM

				Nice post<br />First think u should expecting if joining a real ayahuasca ceremony is vomiting..<br />The rest is a mystery beyond explanation. <br />Trying to explain things like this always becomes wrong, like trying to explain a religious experience (if there is such a thing)<br />Lets say Jesus, Sidhartha, Lao Tzu and Mohammed all where right and got a deeper understanding of the world, when they later tried to explain their insight to those who had yet to get there, it all became adapted to our realm, and suddenly legends and idiocrazy took over.<br />A trip can be seen the same way, nobody can understand who haven&#039;t been there.

				You still cant activate your third eye with this tho and trust me I can fly outside of my fysical body using my astralbody instead of the fysical.. <br /><br />I have done some psycadelics and I can say it does not compare to hearing that buzzing of the pineal gland it sounds like a supercomputer in your head.<br /><br />This is only info for the people who wanna get their &quot;sungodpowers&quot; and you others can continue using drugs to try to find whats inside your third eye since thats what we all are searchin for in life.

				Not everyone is just looking for a party drug here. It seems for the most part, those of us jumping through all the hoops to use SR are pretty serious drug users, not just abusers or careless &quot;junkies&quot;. I myself have done my homework on psychedelics of all sorts. I have enough respect for Ayahuasca to be a little afraid of it. I&#039;m waiting until I know I&#039;m ready (and have the extra BTC) to do it.<br /><br />But really though, let&#039;s not throw names like &quot;junkie&quot; around in a SR forum. Pretty hypocritical if ya ask me.

				Ofcourse I can, there are soundwaves that are scientificly developed to stimulate the pineal gland, there is guided meditations and soundwaves that work like different drugs but apperently they dont work if you dont learn the meditate first of all since them soundwaves dont work if your mind is filled with thoughts. (on youtube there are millions of them)<br /><br />I say skipp all of them soundwaves and write down everything you want to do so that your higher self can see the words and things will start happening.<br /><br />That worked for me it took me 2 days before i woke up outside of my fysical body and for some its even faster then 2 days, but I have not used flouride for 10 years either and flouride creates a shell of calcium around the third eye and it makes it harder to astral travel.<br /><br />But if you live a clean life you should probably be able to do this in 1 day just by writing down what you wanna do, maybe lay the paper under the pillow since many say that it works for them to do that.<br /><br />I have tried drugs, soundwaves and manifesting by writing down what I wanna do and neither drugs or soundwaves worked for me, but manifesting it works , so try that.. Write everything down, all thoughts you wanna get answers to.<br /><br />Monroe who created the soundwaves to be able to astraltravel woke up in the lamp above the bed the first time he astraltraveled, and he noticed someone was laying beside his wife soo he had to look it up who the man was, and when he noticed that it was his fysical body then he got afraid and tried t get into the body fast hahaha<br /><br />And it was almost the same with me since I woke up above my fysial body and i was &quot;halfconcious&quot; but when I became fully concious then I flew back into my fysical body probably because I thought about my fysical body since thats the only thing you have to do to get back into your body.<br /><br />I should had looked at my fysical body when I was my astralbody but I was kinda confused about the whole experience since I thought it was smoke in the aparment.<br /><br />They say it is kinda &quot;foggy&quot; when you remote view things and that probably what i did, I remote vied my kitchen or i flew there with my astralbody.<br /><br />It will become clearer tho the more you do it. things look different when you look at them from your third eye.<br /><br />Please share youre experiences with me in a Pm or with us all in the forumthreads since this isreally interesting to alot of people.<br /><br />And it would be interesting if someone who knows how to meditate and are good at it, if they could test the drug soundwaves since they say they can replicate all different kinds of drugs by just using soundwaves and meditation.<br /><br />Or manifest that you wanna be able to create seratonin and DMT on demand from the pineal gland. Oh damn thats a good idea. We could probably fly thru life on a cloud of seratonin n DMt if we just manifested it&nbsp; by writing it down.<br /><br />Let me say that I dont know where I put that paper i wrote everything down on, and everything stopped when i lost the paper so you need that paper and write alot and look at the words since thats how you manifest&nbsp; things into existance.<br /><br />Later on when youre astraltraveling you will be able to manifest things in the higher dimension that will be moved down to this dimension if you do it continuesly day after day, they say it goes faster and faster to manifest now, in other words it goes faster to get thing down to this dimension from manifesting in higher dimensions.<br /><br />Dont get greedy but they say you can manifest money and I even hear a guy who manifested a guitar just by visualising it night after night in the higher dimensions until it gets moved down into this dimension.<br /><br />Thats what sungods can do I guess, we can create anything we want thru our minds.

				I&#039;ve smoked DMT out of a glass pipe, but I&#039;ve yet to drink the Ayahuasca.&nbsp; I am very interested in going down to Peru and doing it with the Shamans at some point.&nbsp; Sounds like a very interesting experience to say the least, minus the nausea and vomiting in the beginning lol.
