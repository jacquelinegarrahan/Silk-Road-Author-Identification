				I&#039;m new to the road so this might be normal procedure but:<br /><br />I ordered a product, sending my address encrypted with PGP, also including my public key<br /><br />Vendor sent me back an unencrypted message a few days later with my tracking number (which I did not request)<br /><br />My question is, isn&#039;t this equivalent to sending my address unencrypted??&nbsp; I would think LE monitoring TOR exit nodes could grab that tracking and easily obtain my address.<br /><br />Or am I just paranoid??<br />

				We&#039;re in a helicopter over your house right now, COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!<br /><br />Nah im kidding, sorry i dont actualy know the answer to your question but if it helps i had a vendor send me a tracking # unencrypted either, also, i dont think you need to send your public key, they can encrypt their message with their own key and send it back, if they wanted to.

				The tracking number is not evidence of anything illicit in itself. If it were to be intercepted it would not offer even enough information to secure a warrant. Further, a tracking number could simply be anything and typically TOR is very safe even without PGP. PGP is just for those of us with serious privacy issues. The only time I would even worry a little about that tracking number is if it shows the package weighing around 1 kilo as that would be a potential red flag for trafficking, although just marginally more suspicious. You are safe, don&#039;t worry.<br /><br />I provide counter surveillance services for corporations and some individuals who are worried about being spied upon for legal reasons or corporate espionage. I set them up with PGP for all communications even just the more mundane. The idea being, if everything that comes from an IP is encrypted, it looks less suspicious than just the occasional juicy message that just begs for cracking. <br />I don&#039;t use it unless I am discussing business operations.

				None of this ever goes through a exit node.&nbsp; We are on a hidden service so we don&#039;t leave the TOR network.&nbsp; The vendor should have encrypted the tracking number though.
