				well I placed a test order on Thursday , Monday post has been and gone , no delivery , grr<br /><br />I also ordered some other things from dif vendors at the same time and they all arrived Friday morning.<br /><br />So now i start to wonder , what happened to my package , where has it ended up, will this have consequences ?<br /><br />I really cant see a first class delivery taking more than 3 days.<br /><br />O yea and i PM&#039;ed the vendor on Saturday but no reply :( <br /><br />Vendor has 98% &amp; 300 trans , no real bad feedback so not sure about that one.
