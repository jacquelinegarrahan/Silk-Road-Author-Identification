				I would love to place an order but I have no idea how to buy bitcoins. Is there any safe way that I could buy them through SR? I cant even find my SR account address to have them sent there if&nbsp; I figured out how to buy them from localbitcoin.com..<br /><br />&nbsp; Somebody please help me. Thanks in advance.

				You can find your deposit address on SR here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account<br /><br />You can buy there on SR from vendors, sure... but it is possible to get scammed.&nbsp; localbitcoins works great too.

				So once I get my address I give it to the person I&#039;m buying the Bitcoins from at localbitcoin.com and the bitcoins will show up in my SR account?

				You have some reading to do on localbitcoin.<br /><br /><br />No.&nbsp; Well, I guess you could skip escrow with your Localbitcoin seller... but I don&#039;t recommend it.<br /><br />On localbitcoin... you can make a deal to meet in person, right?&nbsp; You make a buy, he should load the coin in the localbitcon escrow, you get a code... when you meet him and show him the money, he releases the coin to you, which are then deposited into your localbitcoin wallet.&nbsp; He will then get that code sent to him, which he must show to you to prove that he released the coin.<br /><br />You then log onto localbitcon and transfer your coin to where you want.&nbsp; &nbsp;Directly to SR if you want as long as you did this anonymously, used tor tor logon to your localbitcoin account , didn&#039;t use your real phone, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />If you make a bank deposit on localbitcoin... it too will be transferred to your account on localbitcoin.

				no, don&#039;t ever give your sr wallet address to the localbitcoin seller.<br /><br />you get a wallet as part of your localbitcoin account. what happens is when the bitcoin seller releases your btc, it shows in your localbitcoin wallet, you will get a notification appear near the top of the screen to tell you this. right by where the notification shows up on the localbitcoins page, you will see a link that says wallet. click that and it will have on the left side of the screen a box to paste in the wallet address of where you want to transfer your funds to. just paste your silkroad wallet address into that, type in the amount of btc&#039;s you want to transfer and click done. the funds will show up in sr usually within the hour but can in some cases take up to six hours. they will always appear tho as long as you done it right.

				Once you have the bitcoins in your wallet, send the BTC to the address provided by SR.... Easy as pie

				I have no idea where you&#039;re located, but I highly recommend you use a known exchange like CampBX. They let you set up an account with nothing more than a screen name and an email address. You can then make deposits with Postal Money Orders and include no more information than your CampBX username and email.<br /><br />Download a good Bitcoin client, I recommend MultiBit. Once your deposit reaches CampBX, you can then buy Bitcoins, which you would immediately send to your Multibit wallet, so that it is kept safe and encrypted on your local machine.<br /><br />When you get ready to buy on SR, just send the Bitcoin the address shown on your SR My Account page.

				www.bitquick.co<br /><br />Is the easiest way I&#039;ve found to buy bitcoins. I use an anonymous email address and I make deposit at a local bank and send verification to bitquick and I&#039;m all set. I use MultiBit a use 3 wallets I pass the coins though before sending them to my SR account. Use PGP when sending address to vendor and all set. At least I seem to think so..

				Thank You for all your help everyone. I think I got it. This may be a stupid question but does the act of just buying bitcoins raise a red flag to the athorities. I know to always go through tor when sending bitcoins to SR account and to upgrade tor on a daily basis but there is nothing shady about just buying bitcoins or is there?<br />

				Innocent till proven guilty is the way I go about my biz on SR. &#039;I didn&#039;t ask anyone to send me a LB of marijuana in the mail has to be a setup or a mistake&#039;. Again, innocent till proven guilty.<br /><br />Using bitquick.co or localbitcoin.com you have the ability to pay cash for BTC&#039;s which can no way be any more anonymous. I usually wear a hat and glasses (disguise) when I go to the bank to deposit into the sellers account, totally unnecessary but still. I have the coins sent to my Multibit wallet which I have 4 wallets setup on (MAIN, Diversion 1, 2 and 3) What I like to do is move the coins through the different wallets before sending them to my SR escrow, again probably unnecessary but will make it tougher for anyone to look and see where the coins originally came from once laundered through multiple wallets before winding up on SR. One rule of mine is I never leave BTC on my SR escrow in case the site is down for a long period of time, don&#039;t want your coins tied up right? <br /><br />Does anyone use a similar method or can point out any flaws to my &#039;system&#039;?
