I know of a few vendors who clear their coins pretty easy on their. If you think about it, it&#039;s pretty easy to use to launder the money.<br /><br />I wont go in to details, but anyone with laundering knowledge should be able to think of at least 2 ways to use it to launder!

				I just don&#039;t have the time, it&#039;d be like running a whole other operation.<br />And my real identity would be linked to it, If the police looked into me I&#039;d be fucked.

				7.5% is really reasonable and i just discovered how to convert ukash online so would be very much up for that, you&#039;re a vendor aren&#039;t you? so you&#039;re gonna have bitcoins pretty regularly, if everything goes smoothly i&#039;d be keen to buy them off you quite regularly

				just saw your bitcoin listing on the road there actually, getting ukash in a bit, it says you only accept first hand vouchers, was looking at converting them on the ukash website and they give you a different code, which means i will no longer have a hard copy of the voucher then, is that ok?
