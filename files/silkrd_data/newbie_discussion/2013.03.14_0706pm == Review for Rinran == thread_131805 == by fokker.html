				As a newbie I&#039;ve ordered my 2nd and 3rd order from Rinran. Both finalized early on request. Both products arrived over land over 3 countries far. The first one arrived in 5 working days the second in 3 days. For me that&#039;s very fast shipping.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried one of both products and it worked as described on erowid.<br /><br />Perfect transactions. Although I finalized early, it&#039;s the only vendor I trust so far. I&#039;ve send him 1 question which he replied the same day.<br /><br />I am very pleased.

				I made my order with Rinran and despite the fact that it was a hedged order Rinran decided not to process my order in a timely fashion. <br /><br />I sent two messages and got no response to either. So not only did he not process my order but he ignored communication with a customer. I canceled my order and went with a different vendor. <br /><br />I will never order from Rinran ever again based on lack of communication.

				I&#039;m not a new buyer but I can&#039;t post in the other thread in the Rumor Mill forum anymore.<br /><br />I ordered some 15 different items from Rinran (all at once), everything went smoothly except for one technical issue which Rinran was quick to respond to. Communication, service, packaging were exceptional. I have yet to weigh and test even half of the compounds, so I can&#039;t say for certain, but based on those I have tried, it sure seems as described. RCs are properly labeled and have a purity marker (most are &quot;&gt;98%&quot;) and come with a paper with chemical data, suggesting a direct-from-lab source hence a high degree of quality control.<br /><br />The stimulant compounds I have tried so far (4-FA, ethylphenidate, MDPV) have produced wonderful, clean highs, and his 4-HO-MET produced a strong, clear-headed tryptamine high distinct from shrooms/4-AcO-DMT.<br /><br />I also got an extra sample in addition to the two samples I asked for.<br /><br />I&#039;m impressed with rinran&#039;s service and quality and he will be my primary stop for RCs.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like paying $15 for a single Adderall pill and you&#039;re considering (much) cheaper NDR/NDRI RC alternatives, I would recommend rinran. All you need in addition is a milligram scale and some rudimentary research skills.<br />

				Hello!<br /><br />I ordered some RC-psychedelics a couple of weeks ago and I got it very fast. I tried it this week-end to see how it was :) I also asked for, and got, a free sample without any whining as you get from many vendors.<br /><br /><br />To keep this simple I am going to make a rating system to the quality of the product and service:<br /><br />Communication: A+<br />Delivery: A+<br />Quality: A+<br /><br />For my RCs, I am going to use rinran as 1st supplier!<br /><br />~Hope this helped

				I ordered 250 mg 5-MeO-DMT HCl to russia. It was delivered after 17 days and it is fast for russian post. <br />Rinran agreed to send it only after FE (because of very bad work of our post and because of scummers (( ). <br />The seller was very pleasant to talk to. <br />5-MeO has good packaging and weight. <br /><br />I have not tried it yet, because i am very busy now. But when i was repacking it, i accidently touched small amount of dust by finger, and i&nbsp; had a light trip after that ! Wow ) <br />Trip was light but completely noticeable. <br /><br />I will try to insufflate 7 mg of it after a week.

				I ordered 250mg DiPT, 250mg 5-MeO-MiPT and 1 gram ethylphenidate and got 50 mg 2C-C for free (as requested). Tested everything (except for the 2C-C), awesome products. Delivery was fairly speedy (within 2 weeks in Europe) and stealthy. Legit guys, got nothing bad to say about em!

				G&#039;day all.<br /><br />Gunna sound like a total stiff....&nbsp; but can someone publish a list of unscheduled RC&#039;s in Ausralia?<br /><br />Any other stories of imports from Rinran to oz would be fab.<br /><br />Cheers
