				It has come to my attention that some of the more established members have been disdainful intimidating and generally detrimental to the newbs. Half&nbsp; of you lot have been here 18 months tops or since the place was founded. May I politely&nbsp; point out you don&#039;t own this place. There are other communities say for instance the WN community, and people have been there 10 years with thousands of post&#039;s.I say the new young bucks are here and just like the older generation of Hippy dealers you will be roughly elbowed aside. Just like virgins in this harsh new world, and you know what happens to virgins in the drug business? They get raped. I can empathize a little you think this club belongs to you, you are sadly mistaken. You may have posted more than us but DPR has put you in your places in regards to the so called originals.

				OMG I have never heard a better statement in my fucking life. Yes sir. Just becuase you have 10,000 posts doesn&#039;t mean your God. It means you need one so you don&#039;t spend all your fucking time on here.

				On the other hand, where there are denigrators there are good hearted people who would bend over backwards. Some are just a bit insecure thinking they&#039;re&nbsp; in an exclusive club and we are encroaching on their&nbsp; territory. The half awake ones are teaching us new members the &quot;Score&quot; They know we are the future. So like anything there&#039;s bit of good and bit of bad. And you&#039;re right the more posts shows the more time spent on here. ( excluding vendors who have no choice) and the less life you are living. If the definition of a psychopath is the inability to form loving relationships, then spending solitary incalculable&nbsp; hours on your own.( On here)&nbsp; &nbsp;must be the perfect process to induce psychopathy. And their are some unstable people here !

				Remember, this is the internet, so there are too many people who haven&#039;t physically interacted with anyone in years. Dude at the corner store doesn&#039;t count. So, they get real brave, territorial, and... well, stupid. You&#039;d never catch a real man/woman running their faggot assed mouth on a forum like that. Then, you have the fact that just any schmuck can&#039;t get on tor, so there is this supplemental feeling of superiority for even being here. Add all that up with a self-esteem issue, and get what we have here. <br /><br />Ignore them, or if you really want, engage them. Then figure out where they are, and fix it if it&#039;s worth it.
