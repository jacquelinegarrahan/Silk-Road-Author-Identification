				I ordered some stuff to my dorm and forgot to specify my name; vendor asked me if I meant to do that and I sent them a new address with my name. Yesterday I got an e-mail from the mailroom saying a package arrived with no name on it asking if I was expecting it. What do I do?

				Just tell them yes, I am expecting an Ebay delivery (of something that would be small) and say you would like to pick it up and check the contents.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not got your name on it.........and if there is some sort of &quot;trap&quot; just say it wasn&#039;t even addressed to me and its obviously not what you were expecting from Ebay.<br /><br />If things do seem odd when you collect, quickly order (or get someone to order / send) you a legit package to tie up your story.<br /><br />You will feel a vibe as soon as you collect, just stay calm :-)

				I&#039;m worried it might be a controlled delivery/they might&#039;ve opened it, though. How can I tell whether it&#039;s suspicious and I should reject?

				Pick it up, LE is way more concerned with dealers (street dealers at that) rather than end users, especially when getting them through the mail, it would take more time and effort for them to try and prove you actually ordered the stuff than what it is worth, I would imagine (I have no proof of this) that they would just confiscate the package, rather than waste a squad of guys to take down a guy ordering a gram of whatever through the mail.&nbsp; And its not like they can use you to get to the dealer, so you are of no value to them.&nbsp; If anything was to go down, you were obviously swatted...right&nbsp; :P

				I don&#039;t understand... if there&#039;s no name on the package, how did they know to email you?&nbsp; Or did you like have your room number on there or something?<br /><br />How much stuff we talking about?... pot?
