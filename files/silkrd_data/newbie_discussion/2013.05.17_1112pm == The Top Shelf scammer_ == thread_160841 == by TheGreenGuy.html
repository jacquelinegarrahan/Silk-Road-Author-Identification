				<br />Like most Silk Roaders, im always looking for a good deal to make some money but dont want to sacrifice quality. Not to mention, extravagant edibles to be healthier and impress friends. So during my process of elimination in my checkout cart, I decided to buy from The Top Shelf for the first time.&nbsp; His feedback checked out and he even responded to my questions quickly. Against my better judgement, i FE&#039;d on a QP, Amber Shatter, CO2 Oil, and Keef Colas! Went to check and see if anyone had updated the FE feedback yet and his seller account is no where to be found!! Usually if something personal happens to a seller, they just refund or take their listings down, not delete their account! So as you can guess, im pretty worried about the fact that i might have gotten scammed. Anyone with new information about this seller and his situation, please share!(Especially if you actually received something!) I have a feeling im not alone here...&nbsp; :-\

				Yeah, TheTopShelf got me too. I am out $140 to this fucking scammer... but a look through the posts in the other forums (just search under his name) shows that I am in good company. Many other people appear to have lost $600 chunks after FE&#039;ing, some lost thousands to this guy.<br /><br />So, obviously the lesson is never to FE, but then if you don&#039;t have many transactions, many vendors will not sell to you unless you do FE. Most of them I would guess, are trustworthy -- but the methodical abuse of the SR system by this guy, who required dozens of people to FE, shows that the system is open to abuse. Maybe the rule of thumb is to just stick with vendors who respect the escrow system... or find a seller who has dealt with you honestly with good service, and perhaps for them only, finalize early.<br /><br />-Rebbeck

				We will see this shit head again but, with a different name. I have come to the conclusion that 80% of the scams are perpetrated by a handful of dedicated children. If we as a community reject F/E scam artists then their resources will dry up and the community can purge these play baby pukes.<br /><br /><br />

				If you can afford to lose your money then go ahead and FE. All scams are nearly always FE related.<br /><br />It&#039;s bullshit that some vendors require n00bs to FE because escrow is there to protect BOTH parties. <br /><br />If a vendor required n00bs to pay for tracked postage there wouldn&#039;t be a problem of some n00bs trying to scam vendors nor would it be &#039;necessary&#039; to make n00bs FE. <br /><br />Idiot buyers who leave it to auto finalize also fuck it up for themselves and other n00bs. Finalize as soon as you get your package and verify its contents!<br /><br />Some vendors say they require FE because escrow takes too long to get the money. If they have no float at all times they are in the wrong business. Just my opinion. <br /><br />

				Sometimes you have to realize, problems can be blessings in disguise. I learned my lesson on not to FE, on a medium sized order, instead of maybe one day losing thousands on a FE transaction. Always try to gain a new perspective on every situation. If my package shows up, awesome, if not, then I guess we all have to get scammed once lol
