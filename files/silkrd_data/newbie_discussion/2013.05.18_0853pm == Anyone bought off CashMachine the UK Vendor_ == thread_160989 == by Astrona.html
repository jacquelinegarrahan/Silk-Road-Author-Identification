				I ordered a gram of cocaine off of Cash Machine on thursday and my order is still processing today and on his page he boasts that the product is shipped with in 5 hours of ordering but here i am still waiting. <br />Has anyone got any past experience with this guy because i really would have liked to get my gear for monday?<br /><br />cheers

				Seriously, don&#039;t even bother with this person, he seems to just never ship. <br /><br />See this thread for more info http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156584.15

				ah yes i remember pure og kush he ripped me off last year( and lots of other ppl) on my seller account. he disapeared, then cash machine turned up instantly. the general agreement was that it was pure og kush.<br /><br />I just created a listing on my vendor account last night offering a cash in the mail delivery service. a few hours later &#039;cashmachine&#039;&nbsp; messaged me saying - &#039; do you buy coins? what is your rate? send me the notes and i will send you the coins&#039; <br />yeh nice try.<br />avoid this guy

				I bought 1g of raw coke and it was really good stuff(similar quality to theXchange) and i was quite paranoid when ordering because of his other crazy listings. I would be careful in ordering large amounts of anything from him just in case he does a runner. From a gut feeling i would guess all his big listings of 1 kilo of coke are fake and if you bought that he would vanish like the 1g of coke i bought from him the night i bought it. His delivery time was good just two days which was in his early trading days.<br />Just be wary i would say to everyone and only spend 3BTC plus with vendors you can really trust and never FE.<br />This game is all about trust and this guy to date has only sold a few big orders like 100g speed so not so big but enough for trust to build up.<br />TheXchange is back on the road and i would like to thank him for his free reship 1g of coke which is clean and strong,buy from this guy if you want nice quality at good price.
