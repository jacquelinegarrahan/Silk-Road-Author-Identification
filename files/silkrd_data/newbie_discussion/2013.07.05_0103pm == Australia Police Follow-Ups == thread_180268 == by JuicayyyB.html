				hi to whoever is reading,<br />was just curious into seeing what happens when a police follow-up occurs and under what circumstances it caused the check up (large amounts, small amounts, specific type of drugs) and what the police did throughout the search??

				Not sure if you are referring to police follow ups from SR purchases, or for raids in general...... If you mean raids in general - here is a story for you. A chick I know owns a house and rents out 3 rooms. All of the tenants are a bit dodgy, but for the most part decent people. Some work. All have previous dealings with the cops but nothing serious - no jail time, only personal use and traffic offenses. <br /><br />Anyway, the chick that owns the house is right into salt water fish tanks, and has big barrels to hold the water, constantly getting packages in the mail for fish stuff, tank chemicals etc etc One of the tenants was a fairly heavy meth user. Would deal but only to friends in small amounts etc. <br /><br />Police raided and on the paperwork, it indicated they thought the meth head tenant was manufacturing meth at the house! Not sure how the cops got the info, but they did a full search on ALL the rooms in the house, including shed and everyone&#039;s cars. <br /><br />The meth head was not cooking there, but did get busted with a bong and weed, and a sml (.5g) amt meth. The chick who owned the house obviously kicked the meth head out after the raid. <br /><br />Since then there has been no hassles at all - the cops have been called since then (by neighbors due to loud music) and no dramas at all. <br /><br />As the house has always been a share house, no one is sure if the cops were watching the house, or were just interested in the meth head. <br /><br />But yeah, no dramas since the original raid.

				If you trawl through the Aussie thread on Off Topic going back some months you will find references to some actual busts related to SR, includes one who was a vendor and having gear mailed from overseas to his home address. Got jail time. Was all publicised in local/national media at the time. Has also been discussed on Clearnet site allthingsvice.com.au.<br /><br />From memory he had multiple seizures but continued to order to his address. Eventually got raided and found with ecstasy, coke etc and dealing paraphenalia, scales, bags etc. Police also gained access to his SR password, purchase / sales records which he foolishly recorded and retained. He was done like a hot dinner as they say!
