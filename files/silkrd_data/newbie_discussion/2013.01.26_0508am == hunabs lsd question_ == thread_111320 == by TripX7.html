				I guess I&#039;m a newbie and can&#039;t ask this anywhere else. Anyway I&#039;m about to eat a bunch of these like 4 and 1/2.<br />Anyway, lsd kinda scares me not cuz of the acid, but because it might not be acid.<br />I&#039;ve taken these before. Seems legit, i got em from NippleSuckcanuck. Are they for sure acid? Anybody test them? I dont wanna like kill myself ODing on some other drug X.x<br /><br />Just my paranoia, anyone know for sure this is lsd?

				If you&#039;re worried about them not being acid, there&#039;s a couple things you can do to try to test. Taste one... acid should be pretty much tasteless, or have a very mild taste. RC&#039;s will have a very noticable bitter and numbing taste. Also, acid works perfectly fine if you swallow it, but nbomes need to be held against your cheek/gum/under tongue for a very long time to work. So if you&#039;re concerned, just swallow a tab or two straight down, and if it works it&#039;s likely real acid, and if nothing happens, you&#039;ve avoided taking an nbome. :)<br /><br />I think DOx&#039;s still work if you swallow them straight down, but they&#039;ll take forever (like 3 hours) to start working, and will last ages too, so if that happens you&#039;ll know what the rest of the batch is.
