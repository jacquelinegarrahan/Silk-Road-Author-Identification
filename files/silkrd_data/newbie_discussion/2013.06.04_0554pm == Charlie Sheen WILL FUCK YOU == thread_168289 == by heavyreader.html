				Just got this from Mr. Sheen:<br /><br />I regret to inform you that your drugs have not been sent, and I will have to request that you send 1 bitcoin to the following address: 1FFa4Ky3NktkewjJA6mEF1qQSSHiNTV9vq<br /><br />Failure to do so will result in the address you provided being spammed on the forums for weeks\months to come to ensure that even if it is an anonymous drop address LE will have a location closely linked to your forum persona and any current or future orders will be lost. On the other hand, those of you that provided their home address or that of someone close to them will have a lot more to deal with. I am not asking much so think very carefully and consider if this is potentially worth your freedom.<br /><br />Charlie<br /><br /><br />what a fucking dumbass, first he scams me for pocket change and then tries to extort me??&nbsp; i&#039;m retarded for sending him anything in the first place, but what kind of idiot really thinks that i would use my real drop on something this sketchy??&nbsp; have fun sending LE to the drop shithead, they&#039;re gonna laugh their ass off the second they walk through the (non-existent) door..&nbsp; what a fucking tool, and what a fucking tool i am for falling for this..&nbsp; <br /><br />here is the thread where he offered the &quot;samples&quot; - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165471.0<br /><br />if you&#039;ve placed a sample order with him, then sorry guys, that sucks.&nbsp; but don&#039;t send him shit, even if he does have your real info (jesus i hope nobody sent him anything that they would even ever plan to use again), the second he tries to spam it the mods will get rid of the offending post.&nbsp; fuck you charlie sheen, nice try but people aren&#039;t as stupid as you think..&nbsp; have fun with my money, i hope you can find something on here you can actually buy with that amount LOL loser

				Hey astor, i think that was bullshit. No way to know for sure. The member that said he was doxing him is a new account, thats signs his posts aryan nation or something. <br /><br />I tell ya man, I really cant stand whats happened to this place in the past 8 months or so.

				wow who knew that the SR Charlie Sheen would act a lot like the real life Charlie Sheen. Why pay 500 bucks for an account just to try to scam people? Seems like a lot of work for not a lot of reward. When you think about it you will only get a handful of orders before your name is blasted all over the forums and you are pretty much fucked.

Really, it&#039;s so big now that it&#039;s hard to call a community. Lately when I go through the subforums that I rarely frequent, I&#039;ll see names that I&#039;ve never seen before with 500+ posts. I&#039;m like, where did this person come from? There was a time when I knew everyone with 500+ posts.<br /><br />It&#039;s like graduating from a big high school and seeing people you&#039;ve never seen before on graduation day. You were here the whole four years? Oh really.<br /><br />But yeah, the worst part is all the scammers and doxers and idiots. That comes with everyone being strangers.<br /><br />There&#039;s a group of people that I&#039;ve gotten to know pretty well, and they are 80% of the reason I hang out here.<br /><br />Peace, db.

				I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot; but I think the mods should make this site like what.cd. You would have to be invited to join and would have to contribute to the site to stay on it. It would keep the people who just pop in for a day then never return and I think it would help keep the site more like a community. Just my opinion though

				Wait, what? <br />That&#039;s kind of ingenious. create some post offering free samples, gather addresses, send extortion pms to people.<br />Even if he gets a single bitcoin, it was worth it. 5 minutes of that thread out there, 100 pms with addresses. 100 pms to the senders, maybe 4% send the bitcoin. That&#039;s 4 bitcoins for 20 minutes work.<br /><br />Damn, I need to automate this...<br /><br />/wanders off to see if she can get her scripting software to cooperate with ToR.
