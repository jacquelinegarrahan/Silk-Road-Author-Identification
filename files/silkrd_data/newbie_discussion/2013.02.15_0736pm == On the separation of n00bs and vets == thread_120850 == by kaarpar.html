				from what I understand, and I could be misunderstanding, but the 50post benchmark was done in a effort to: <br /><br />(1) force n00bs to become a part of the community in a concrete way before adding their two cents?<br />(2) prevent against scammers who infiltrate and make us all more vulnerable? <br />(3) + whatever else I have not yet considered... <br /><br />still, isn&#039;t there something to be said for the problems (albeit small) that this might invite. for one, many n00bs on the boards are not n00bs to SR. so the frustration on their part is more than understood. they have earned the right to contribute, so hopefully something can be done on a case-by-case basis - though that might be asking a lot of forum resources. <br /><br />but also, and this hasn&#039;t happened yet, but my other concern would be that as n00bs can only post in the n00b section and vets can post wherever they want, we might not always be getting the best info re: a security matter or a question about a vendor.&nbsp; think about it, our lack of experience makes us vulnerable and not being able to post alongside the vets (to occasionally be shot down or gut-checked) makes us even better targets. of course, the community is what makes SR strong so measures that are in the interest of our safety as whole is totally the right thing to do. <br /><br />I will say that the vets I have been in contact with (~10 purchases in) are more than generous with their time, patience, advice both off and on the forums. (farmer1 stands out here. he practiced PGP with me many moons ago - I&#039;m still grateful for that and his skush!) <br /><br /><br />anyway, what do ya&#039;ll think?

				I think another reason is to stop &#039;dodgy&#039; vendors creating multiple accounts and giving themselves positive feedback. But 50 posts is just too much, everybody seems to spam to get to 50 anyway.

				@mrbugle&nbsp; those are my instincts as well. but still rough times! I went to review for lucymcgee - not that she needs it, but why not add a voice to the choir - and was real disappointed. here&#039;s to hoping your road to 50 is painless or a moderator sets you straight. <br /><br />@lemonz0r totally, I noticed that too. these forums are spam city now - it&#039;s like freaking hawai&#039;i. (ha. ha. lamesauce, I know) i&#039;m hoping not to resort to that and earn my way into the conversation. but no guarantees as my mind is willing by my attention span is weak.

				As far as I understood it, the 50 post rule was to help keep the forums more &#039;real&#039;. Both to prevent vendors from screwing over other vendors/giving themselves great feedback and to prevent bots/people from spamming the forums with shitty SR products and bitcoin exchangers.<br /><br />It&#039;d be awesome if they instituted a way to tie your SR account to the forums so your buying history could stand-in instead of post counting.

				Im not a noob on SR but rarely post on the forums but I think its fucking genius to require 50 posts before being able to post anywhere else. LE isnt going to take the time to make 50 posts before being able to infiltrate a board. I know they can still read everything, but LE is going to want to gain trust by posting and creating a dialog with potential criminals.

				I think you make some valid points in regard to advise.&nbsp; It really is a double edged sword, but my overall opinion of it is that it&#039;s a good idea.&nbsp; I&#039;m just grateful that some vets/moderators come in here and help out with advise and answering questions.&nbsp; It&#039;s much appreciated.

				I&#039;m a senior member with almost 400 posts and 12 transactions under my belt.<br />But I *definitely* still consider myself a noob.<br /><br />Only been here four weeks. My post count &amp; buyer stats just mean that I talk a lot and like to get high. lol <br />Post-count isn&#039;t directly proportionate to accrued SR knowledge.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I DO think that the vendor 50-post lock out is kinda counter productive though. Don&#039;t really see the logic behind that, tbh.

Taking this measure, has helped the main forum immensely, it&#039;s not to separate anyone from anyone, it&#039;s intentions is to keep the forum running as smoothly as possible.

				At first I thought the 50 was crazy high for a n00b but now after a while I&#039;ve come to realize that the 50 is about quality and while I could post 50 spam posts to get my full &quot;wings&quot; I&#039;m more likely to get + karma and 50 posts which to me is more important if I properly engage in decent conversation.&nbsp; To that end I&#039;m trying to do this the right way to earn a good rep first and foremost.&nbsp; Just because you have 50 posts doesn&#039;t mean you know jack shit either.
