				Okay I know how to add Public keys to my PGP program. I also know how to encrypt messages and get it to show the encrypted coded message in my PGP Clipboard.....<br /><br />But I am having trouble figuring out what to do once I have the code.<br /><br />Like I will select a Public PGP Key and encrypt a message specifically for that particular PGP User, but now the question is......<br /><br />How do I send this code to the PGP User, like, how do I send him the code, so he can then decode / decrypt the message with his PGP Program?<br /><br />I am sure the answer is a simple one but I haven&#039;t been able to really find any topics about this specific PGP Question....so Thanks a bunch

				Basically where ever the normal non encrypted message would go is where you paste the message, don&#039;t worry if it looks like a lot of writing or odd, the other person will just copy it all all out of the text box anyway.

				When you make an order, paste your encrypted address info in the addy box. Most vendors only want that part encrypted and regular messages are ok non encrypted unless they contain info that need encrypting. If you just say product in a mssg instead of coke or weed and such it should be ok non encrypted. Decrypting is just an xtra step and takes time, thats why most only want necessary info encrypted.

				Pleasure. I&#039;m pretty new to SR myself and have been amazed how nice, friendly and helpful people on the forums are, and how professional vendors have been on SR itself.<br /><br />Its worth being causous however and checking out your chosen vendor ratings and reviews, and searching for them on these forums before you place your first order.<br /><br />Always use encryption (as you&#039;re trying to), so make sure you ask any more questions if you can&#039;t get it to work for any reason.<br /><br />And finally don&#039;t FE (Finalize Early). When you put bitcoins into your SR wallet and place an order, those bitcoins go into a escrow system and the vendor only gets their bitcoins when you either wait 17 days or Finalize Early and release the payment. FE&#039;ing basically means paying your vendor before you have received the product. Reputable vendors do not require your to FE, so if they demand it, be careful before proceeding.<br /><br />Good luck!
