				I have been sold methylone instead of MDMA I think . The vendor holds 5stars.I have read a lot of threads on here and Im almost sure this is the case. I have been taking mdma many many times and I can clearly say the difference in experience. I had to took a bit more to feel the effects. Every time It starts with increased body temperature , heart pounding- my friend even had a chest pain :( it was also very strange aftertaste and mouth feeling, strong jaw clenching, not a strong feeling of euphoria.It was also feeling of disorientation at the beggining. The feeling was very speedy but lacked very characteristic &#039;magic&#039; of mdma- no changes in perception of music.... The product was sold as a clear/white moonrocks- with very characteristic strong chemical smell and dissolved faster than mdma when taken orally. What do you think? how can I be 100%sure that it was methylone? It pisses me off that people write reviews and cant distinguish between methylone and good mdma. Vendors get excellent reviews but customers suffers .I didint like the feeling and I bought few g of something which doesnt seem to be even close to molly

				How about investing in a few reagent tests to keep on hand?&nbsp; Seems like cheap insurance and a positive way to positively call out a problem substance without the subjectivity of individual experience... Posting the results on here would also serve as either a great recommendation for the vendor or a very valuable warning to would-be buyers.&nbsp;

				Either Marquis or Mecke will give a positive reaction for MDMA and a different color for most cathinones or other chems that get passed off as MDMA. There are a few things that can show up the same color as MDMA and to differentiate between those after testing with Meckee or Marquis you can use Simon&#039;s reagent.

				Ok, so now it is official . I bought yesterday ez test kit-marquis. I put a sample inside.It gave some smoke and went into black in 2-3 sec. Results : DMX !!! suprise suprise. I thought maybe methylone, I didint now that people can sell such a product.And can you believe that it is selling well ? or maybe it was just me ? because im a newbie? wtf? wake up people and write good feedback and test your stuff if something doesnt feel right !

				I am scared to even purchase any MDMA off here.&nbsp; Bulk research chemicals are very easy and dirt cheap to acquire.&nbsp; As we all know, many of them produce similar effects to the real thing.&nbsp; Personally, I would not go by reviews on something like this.&nbsp; Many people are rating 5/5 just cause they are happy they got something in the mail.

				Learn more how to use tests slirp :) I used the test because the effects were obviously not MDMA.&nbsp; I felt strangeness, a bit of disorientation at the beginning, very weird .... all my friends the same. I have been using MDMA for 5 years, never been sold fake molly. I know the stuff so forgive me but I know exactly what I am talking about. And I am far from hyping that is so cool to buy on silk road. I had expected quality stuff as I have seen feedback system and Avengers. But apparently it doesnt help . I bought a test because I wanted to have hard evidence. Mdma gives purple/ dark purple. It was pure black indicating DXM. So then, I went on to read some stories , and yes indeed some effects were really nasty like people reported. especially this high body temperature, feeling in mouth and weirdness.... So yes . it is official. tested. Be careful people and if you never had experience with MDMA buy test kit and test it first. If you had - be honest with yoursef!

				It&#039;s disgusting how many different substances are going around being called &quot;molly&quot; that&#039;s why it&#039;s really important to test your stuff, especially if you plan on ingesting it. Which leads me to my second point:<br /><br />You have to be careful when seeing a reagent reaction. Sometimes the colors aren&#039;t easy to see and the reaction happens quick. It helps to put it on a dish and smear it a little with a tooth pick or something, or make it run so you an see the true color underneath that dark hue. For example, it might look black, but it could just be a really really deep blue/purple which indicates a good marquis reaction for MDXX. The Simmons I believe is the one that confirms it&#039;s MDMA and not MDXX. That one turns a light blue, really easy to tell that one, but it isn&#039;t very common. Most likely it will be MDMA with a marquis reaction like that. The mecke would go to a similar very very dark blue but would be green for the first few seconds. You&#039;ll start to learn your reactions =) you can start with just a marquis like I did, but it really pays to get all the reagents so you can know for sure what you have and cross confirm the reactions. I hope this helps!<br />experience: raving for several years, testing my stuff, knowing my stuff, respecting what I put in my body.

				I understand. But the reaction for DXM was exactly as described in the internet and indeed it gets sold as molly unfortunately.Maybe it was mixed with something. I remember first time taking it ... there was a feeling of the paranoia at the beggining- which suprised me cos i dont get it on molly. Then first effects wore out very quickly. It dosent happen that 1 g of molly disapears so quickly.... We had also a strong headache on the other day ...the weird and horrible aftertaste in mouth like after speed . <br />We can discuss and discuss about what it was... I know what effects molly gives - I have said it 1000times. It wont change the fact that someone here sells fake stuff- either selectively or for everyone. The reason why I put this topic up - is that I want to help others and not let this guy sell the shit anymore. Today I sent the message to the vendor, he ignored me. The vendors name is Technohippy. I was happy customer with him. He is speedy, responsive , I was happy with the pills I bought from him previously- they were as described. However just because someone has a good reputation and is 5 star vendor - doesnt mean I have to keep my mouth shut. Nobody wants to get some shit and feel horrible.You can do whatever you want with this information but please stop try to convince that it was MDMA. I think it schould be reported or checked by someone else and forbiden to sell. or at least properly called - like &quot; a mixture of DXM and other shit &quot; for those who like horrible trips

I was happy customer with him. He is speedy, responsive , I was happy with the pills I bought from him previously- they were as described. However just because someone has a good reputation and is 5 star vendor - doesnt mean I have to keep my mouth shut. Nobody wants to get some shit and feel horrible.You can do whatever you want with this information but please stop try to convince that it was MDMA.

				BTW, taken from the EZ test website :<br />What DXM does…<br />- A high dose will cause users to feel very spacey and “out of it”. It impairs motor control and causes robot-like movements. It can also produce audio and visual hallucinations, and can sometimes cause nausea and itchy skin.<br />- Some people use DXM recreationally. When they do, they nearly always do it at home, in bed or on their couch.<br />- DXM is definitely not a dance drug, and getting scammed with a DXM tablet when you are expecting ecstasy (xtc) is no fun at all.<br />- It can also be quite dangerous. High doses of DXM have contributed to numerous cases of rave-related heatstroke.<br />- It is even more dangerous to combined DXM with real Ecstasy. Both drugs are metabolized through the same liver enzyme, CYP-2D6 (pronounced “sip-two-dee-six), which means that if you combine them together your liver will not be able to break them down as efficiently as it should. This can lead to significantly heightened effects from the DXM, and a much greater chance of suffering a heatstroke reaction.<br />- Taking breaks from dancing, and staying hydrated are always the best ways to reduce the risk of heatstroke at a rave. If you think you may have accidentally consumed a pill containing DXM, however, you should probably not dance at all, and should stay in a cool environment. Have some friends watch out for you, and chill out for the evening.<br />- Remember, your chances of heatstroke are greater if you have consumed DXM, and greatest if you have consumed both MDMA and DXM together.<br /><br />

				hallucinating horse, yes... the head was terrible next day. but I still was thinking: no, 5star vendor, fast, efficient, it is not possible, it is low quality mdma. In matter of fact on his vendor page it says : &quot;good quality mdma&quot;- good , not excellent like most of them claims here, so I took it as a honesty that the product is good but not top notch. Until I tested it and had to admit it : I was sold shit. And it is not subjective opinion, but confirmed by 7 of my friends<br />JackJarvisEsq, I believe there is plenty of good MDMA here, you just have to now where to buy it. I dont know how they sell shit sometimes. I have seen 5star vendors pages here where 2 on 10 people gets shit instead of the product and nobody cares. Life is Life.<br />

				It worries me now, lets keep fingers crossed that methylone will not replace mdma .since when it became so superfamous to do buisness like that? btw, just read a thread somewhere that vendor that is placed in 1% of highest ranks sells selectively methylone and other stuff like dxm cut with mdma and god knows what else Definietely it doesnt make me optimistic about shopping here. How does it work here? What is the procedure to report the vendor if he continuosly sells shit to people? or they do get away with it?&nbsp; If we could report such people , maybe they could improve quality of their services or at least dont sell fake stuff.

				I find this whole scenario sketchy, the OP has not done a definitive test, this is all purely speculation, in view of this, I think it is very unfair to publicly name the vendor, who I have followed since they came onto SR, I actually did a review on the E tablets and have since purchased a few items, all have been fairly priced and Technohippy have shown themselves as being principled vendors with good ethics, I find it very doubtful that they would pull such a stroke, when they have so much to loose- many people on here either test their drugs themselves or take them to an official tester, I&#039;m sure somebody else would have raised this issue before now. Just because it is easy to buy these tests, it does not mean just anybody can pick one up and correctly use one without having been trained and having gained experience in previously testing known samples of drugs, then noting the reactions.<br />Of course, this is my speculation, but nothing I have read here suggests any truth in the OP&#039;s opening statement!

				The reason for opening this thread was to warn other people. I think I made myself clear enough. Technohippy is a vendor here for 4 months- not very long time I suppose. I have found him and was very pleased to buy his product.&nbsp; I was really happy with the price - 26£ for a gr of good quality MDMA. and the speed of delivery. I cant complain about that. I tried turtles- not the strongest pills I had but no hangover, nice, euphoric feeling . But his mdma? I couldnt believe at the beggining and thought that maybe it is just my imagination or something. But I will repeat : I felt really horrible after this product. nothing really even close to mdma. It was more speedy, sweaty feeling with a bit of desorientation. I tested the product as I wanted to know the truth and I have found out. <br />At the beggining when I wasnt sure I didint reveal vendors name. I sent a message to the vendor , I was ignored. After a while he said that all of his stuff is lab-tested (the picture of mdma on his page is not the same like the product that was sold to me) and it is just me complaining.Today he even &quot;threatened&quot; to me that I will be blacklisted as I user . So in this case do I have any rights as a buyer? I pay money for the product - get shit , leave a honest feedback and get banned? It schould speak for itself. <br />Technohippy is a businessmen here , he makes money. Maybe his business is efficient, he doesnt scamm, delivers very fast but his MDMA product is not as described .Maybe I was just the only person that got this shitty product, or maybe he sends it selectively- I dont know...<br />But I do know that people have right to know- that is the reason for this forum to exist, so we share information, experiences and support each other. I dont buy fake perfums here , but something that I put into my body !&nbsp; I have no interest to lie here. Go ahead and buy it and test it yourself ! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Been a lurker on these forums for a while and a customer on the main site for just over a year but this thread made me sign up.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a couple of orders for MDMA from Technohippy, one back in July and a larger one a couple of weeks back. I therefore have samples from their newest batch as well as the previous one. The previous batch is an exceptionally clean / pure looking crystal, the newest also not far off in purity. Both batches look like good clean MD and while not personally tried by myself, my friends have heaped praise on the product as being much better than the street stuff going around here (well-known northern UK town).<br /><br />I just picked up two EZ Test kits (Marquis) today and tested both batches. Both kits turned instantly dark purple - black with a fizz / pop and emission of smoke. Total reaction time less than two seconds.<br /><br />I have photos of both tests but I can&#039;t seem to find a working anonymous Tor image hosting service to upload these to. If anyone could post a link here of a working service then I&#039;ll get these up ASAP.<br /><br />Ergo, I conclude that the OP is either a. inexperienced with MDMA / the MDMA testing procedure or b. a shill for another vendor.

				Warriorsdance... are you working for Technohippy? :)) If not I think you have been&nbsp; exceptionally lucky to get such a quality product, unfortunately it seems that some people still get shit instead of MDMA... And I think that either you were very lucky- just some people get a real stuff from him, or your comments are just a very common strategy to encourage new customers despite my negative comments. Why you assume I am inexperienced MDMA user or I work for another vendor? Havent you read the thread carefully? Your opinion given here clearly suggest you want to discredit my comments so others dont take them too seriously. <br />I would also want to try his best quality product, unfortunately I have had occasion to do it twice already ... and I will never buy again. From what I have observed there is a lot of fake comments and fake users around in interests of some vendors who unfortunately has to use this tactic...<br />Be aware people... and read carefully a thread :)

				I&#039;m definitely not working for him/her/them, I&#039;m just a customer who has used this vendor before and, on seeing this thread, decided to test the merchandise for myself out of concern for myself and my friends.<br /><br />I&#039;m not denying that legit, top 1% vendors have in the past sold dodgy gear either intentionally or unintentionally, but the quantity of stuff Technohippy seems to move would suggest that if they had a shady batch going on they&#039;d do anything they could to rectify this for the customer.<br /><br />This is only pure speculation, and I don&#039;t really want to discuss things that may or may not be true, but the quantity and type of a certain product Technohippy sells regularly leads me to think that they may well have a secure and regular source for some of the best MD being produced at the moment. Not quite Mortak Kombat / Partyflock / Android quality MD but still above a lot of the shit that gets passed off as MD nowadays.<br /><br />Again, I have pictures of the samples / tests which I&#039;m happy to upload providing someone can point me to a secure and anonymous Tor image hosting service.

If you had - be honest with yoursef!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ermmmm......Hang on a minute, 3 days ago, you admitted you had never used any tester before, but now you are an authority on them:<br />Quote: &quot;Learn more how to use tests slirp :)&quot;<br />

				:) I meant instruction on the test . I am not authority and never claimed to be. I will repeat: read the thread carefully ! test was just to confirm my feelings and I have a whole bag of this shit to test it again. I was definitely stoned but the difference between MDMA and this is like from the earth to the moon :) <br />I replied to your message just to state that the forum is clearly to give feedback and help each other. Those who &quot;think&quot; , will know how to use this information, and some others will try to discredit my opinion ... I would personally really wanted to know what is sold &quot;out there&quot; :)<br />And as far as I am concerned it is not a sunday market so we schould be careful even more. ..

				Warriorsdance.... again... I tested the stuff as well. I had two different batches from him- but just the last one got tested. With the first one- we had just 1 g for a party - it dissapered very quickly- now I know why- it never had the real potency of MDMA and was totally different substance- thus the strangness of the trip/ the effects were very the same as the last one. However I am not the person that is seeking for a problem.I gave Technohippys great feedback and ordered another 3.5 g - I really more looked into it as it was my subjective trip - but it wasnt , how I was about to find out. I would really want to believe that he wasnt aware he is selling this or accidentaly someone gave him this fucked up batch , but it happend and this is my story. Vendor clearly didint care about what happend , he wasnt willing to even dissuss it with me- on contrary - he said he will report me - and I will be blacklisted as a user. <br />Maybe some people get MDMA from his legit source , but unfortunately it wasnt me - twice. I am not saying he is selling it to everyone- how the hell can I know? I am reporting what happened to me. I think personally it is important.<br />I also have pictures and I am willing to send to anyone who is curious. I can test it again using different tester even.<br />I dont see the reason to argue about it here. People asked me to test it&nbsp; and to reveal vendors name - I did it. I didint go stright away and put a vendors name in a thread to flash around. I patientlly waited to test it, to speak to the vendor. I was really pissed off.I trusted him - whatever trust means here :)<br />If you 100% sure he sells the best stuff- thats great :) congratulations , lucky you ... Like I said let everybody judge what to do with the information I have given here :)

				I just try to provide a balanced &quot;voice of reason&quot;, I can understand the way you feel about the way your complaint has been handled, what I do know, is that when I did a tester, the other person that signed up for a tester, tried to extort drugs out of them by threatening to claim the pill in question was fake. Every day on these forums, there are blackmail/scammer/extortion attempts, I can well believe that this may the reason for the &quot;attitude&quot;, although it doesn&#039;t forgive it!<br /><br />This is what Alexander Shulgin, a medicinal chemist, biochemist, pharmacologist, psychopharmacologist,&nbsp; has to say on the subject of the Marquis Reagent and MDMA:<br /><br />&quot;The Marquis reagent is a spot test for alkaloids that was first reported in 1896. The original testing agent was a mixture of 2 drops of 40% formaldehyde and 3 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid. It was originally used for detecting small amounts of certain alkaloids, and for distinguishing between them. The signature of the alkaloid is both the initial color produced, as well as the sequence of color changes occurring with time. In the early days the Marquis reagent was used primarily to distinguish the opium alkaloids. Each alkaloid had a pattern of color change. It is being used today as one of the identifying tools in trying to establish just what may be present in something that is sold as ecstasy. The compounds in the MDA, MDMA, MDE family give a purple-black color, whereas with amphetamine the color is usually an orange brown.&quot;<br /><br />and in particular:<br /><br />&quot;As the test is extremely sensitive, no estimate can be easily made as to the quantity of alkaloid present. And of course, a dark color will tend to hide a light color. As with all assays requiring subjective interpretation, experience is everything. Unfortunately, with our present restrictive stance on Scheduled drugs, it is almost impossible to get documented reference samples of alkaloids of interest, further limiting the accuracy of this kind of field tests.&quot;

				bobhope333, thanks for being a &quot;voice of reason&quot;and understanding. Now, I understand your point. Obviously I understand the whole &quot;issue&quot; with testing....<br />However , like I said many times, dosent matter what it was , it wasnt molly for sure :)
