				Hey guys, <br />Another newb vendor question. Is there a way on SR to offer combined shipping? So if for example, someone wanted to buy 2 items from me they would only have to pay for the one initial shipping cost? What I have done initially was made two shipping options, Priority $5 and Combined $0. But I just got an order today and I think what happened was that the buyer just selected the combined and didn&#039;t pay for shipping. I will still ship this item and eat the shipping cost on my end this time. But is there any way to offer this kind of thing without&nbsp; this happening in the future?<br />Any advice is appreciated.<br />Thanks

				&nbsp;???<br /><br />That&#039;s being a very kind vendor, even a bit too kind as it should be the buyer&#039;s responsibility to select the correct shipping method for each item. They are supposed to choose priority option on one order and additional on the rest. Don&#039;t accept the order if its incorrect and let them clearly know what to do on your vendor page - nope, there are no such options...

				You&#039;re doing it right, but you need to make everything clear on your vendor page/item listings when it comes to combined shipping.&nbsp; Put it in your descriptions that you will cancel immediately if they do not choose at least one payable shipping option with their order(s).

				&nbsp;:) Thank you!!!! That is exactly the info that I needed. At least now I know. It would be nice if some how SR could program so that combined only came up for multiple items somehow. Oh well. <br />Thanks again!!!

				Yeah, there are a few things SR staff could improve on, but it isn&#039;t asking too much to go the extra mile for what we&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Honestly, they could probably totally revamp the site this second to be more user-friendly, but they don&#039;t to keep us on our toes.&nbsp; It&#039;s another reason why one should always have a long, difficult password with a mnemonic pairing or something.&nbsp; Get the brain working overtime to avoid any screw-ups lol
