During that time the site has generated thousands of sales while consistently maintaining an exemplary feedback rating of 4.9/5.0. I can&#039;t even put a $ amount on how much the name has generated in sales.<br /><br />Items sold have included (but not limited to):<br /><br />-Prescriptions<br />-Benzo&#039;s (Etizolam)<br />-High Purity Uncut Cocaine<br />-Cut Cocaine<br />-High Grade Weed<br />-Medium Grade Commercial Weed<br />-Imported Mexican Weed<br />-BTC for Cash In Mail service for no fee<br /><br />Included with purchase of the account is my Forum profile going by the same name with hundreds of posts and good karma rating.<br /><br />With purchase is the option to retain distributorship privileges with me so that all listings remain and profits are thus maximized without interruption.<br /><br />I am selling because I have other vendor pages going now and I want to consolidate a little. I have too many irons in the fire.<br /><br />I am starting bidding at $100,000 USD. Serious business oriented vendors/investors ONLY. <br /><br />My Public Key is listed on my profile page. Please PGP any serious conversations/offers.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />DOC<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />
