				Here&#039;s a quick review of my purchase of one anonymous debit card.<br /><br />Soon after ordering the card I received some instructions.<br />The card itself arrived after two workdays.<br /><br />The instructions proved useful as the card itself didn&#039;t include any in English.<br />The recommended exchange didn&#039;t require any registration and the IBAN transfer was very fast (1.5h).<br />It did have at least one TOR exit node blocked but I could easily get around it by using &quot;new identity&quot; once.<br />I have used the card for an online purchase and it worked flawlessly.<br /><br />Two minor issues, no problem for me but maybe worth mentioning:<br />Listed as shipping from Germany but actually shipping from Poland.<br />Handwritten address might stand out a little bit.<br /><br />Would buy again.

				I&#039;ve never heard of these anonymous debit cards. How exactly do they work?<br /><br />I buy one from you, then I can use the card to buy items online through TOR? Is this safe?<br /><br />Also, going to buy some LSD soon, great price&nbsp; 8)

				Yahoira, debit cards works like bank account but without possibility to send money, it&#039;s kind of wallet like bitcoin wallet but it has got iban and swift/bic so you can load money on there, do deposits and withdrawal. You can purchase products anonymously online/instore, wash money, withdraw money from exchanged bitcoins, create paypal account on it, scam/fraud, use it for carding and other money crimes.<br />You&#039;re welcome and we will help you with product if you will have any issues or questions.<br />Regards,<br />DAC

				WARNING!!: I bought one hit of some psychadelic from this guy and he advertised it as 150microgramm LSD for 0.66 BTC so incredibly cheap so I couldn&#039;t resist.. But there is no way that this could have been LSD since there was a bitter and chemical taste to it and the trip lasted well over 20 hours with severe mindfucks included! I am guessing that it was something like DOB or maybe DOC which is very cheaply produced in China. <br />So I would never ever recommend this vendor to anyone since the advertising of false drugs is pretty much the worst thing that you can do!<br />He probably sells his moderate weed and thats how he gets the good feedback and I can&#039;t tell you anything about that but don&#039;t touch his 150 microgramm LSD! (I don&#039;t know anything about his 140microgramm LSD either which he sells for 0.88BTC so already the way he makes his prices don&#039;t make any sense at all!)<br />I am hoping that I saved someone from a bad trip with this feedback so be careful!

				And why the lack of reviews? you guys have over 300 transactions where is your customer base? Just seems strange to me. Other vendors seem to have A solid base. Oh well what do I know I am only 4 months in.

				I appreciate your prompt service! Unfortunately I have been unable to use the cards without the tutorial. How long do you normally take to send tutorial? Or does anyone here have the tutorial? I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thank you

				He has the best prices! And he is quick too! Unfortunately he is pretty slow in responding to emails. I have been waiting for a tutorial on how to use the cards for about a week after I have received the cards. Other than that I highly recommend him.
