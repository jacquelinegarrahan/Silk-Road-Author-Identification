				Hello all,<br /><br />I was looking for a drug that is banned in my country more used too much at parties and carnivals (LAUNCHES PERFUME ARGENTINO) bad I found no reference here to the forum and not in the SR.<br />Some already used this drug?<br />Someone sells?<br />Someone already had good experiences.<br /><br />I already used, like mainly to use at parties.<br /><br />Below is the description of the drug;<br />-----------------------#-----------------------------------<br />Inhalants or Solvents<br />Definition: In general, all solvent is a highly volatile substance, ie evaporate naturally, Therefore can easily be inhaled.

Often the user may become unconscious or Suffer seizures and even sudden death from cardiac or respiratory arrest. Learn more ...<br /><br />Consumption in Brazil: The use of solvents or inhalants in Brazil prevalent among male students and children and adolescents living on the streets. Learn more ...<br /><br />Definition<br />The term means a solvent capable of dissolving substance things and inhalant is any substance Which can be inhaled, ie Introduced into the body through the suction through the nose or mouth.<br />In general, all solvent is a highly volatile substance, ie evaporate naturally, Therefore can easily be inhaled. Another feature of solvents or inhalants Is that many (but not all) are flammable.<br /><br />A huge number of commercial products such as nail polishes, glues, paints, thinners, propellants, gasoline, removers, varnishes etc., Contains these solvents. They can be vacuumed involuntarily (eg, workers in industries of shoes or paint shops, all day exposed to air Contaminated by these substances) or voluntarily (eg, children living on the streets smelling glue, the boy home smelling acetone or nail polish, or a student who smells Carbex ® concealer etc. ..).<br /><br />All these substances are solvents or inhalants Which belong to a chemical group called hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, trichlorethylene etc. .. To ILLUSTRATE, here is the composition of some adhesives shoemaker sold in Brazil: Cascola ® - mixture of toluene + n-hexane ®, Extra ® Patex - mixture of toluene and ethyl acetate with mineral spirits; Brascoplast ® - ethyl acetate and toluene solvent with for rubber.<br /><br />The well-known product in Brazil is the &quot;smell&quot; or &quot;lolo&quot;, also known as &quot;whiff of lolo.&quot; It is illegal to a prepared base chloroform and ether used only for purposes of abuse.<br /><br />But we Know That When these &quot;manufacturers&quot; are not One of Those two substances, They mix something else instead. Thus, in relation to the &quot;smell of lolo&quot; not well known composition, Which complicates When You have cases of acute intoxication by this mixture.<br /><br />It is important to draw attention to the launch perfume. This name means That INITIALLY That liquid comes in tubes and is used in the carnival. Based on ethyl chloride or chloroethyl is prohibited its manufacture in Brazil and only appears in times of carnival, smuggled from other South American countries. But Increasingly inhalants is the name used to designate Also the &quot;smell of lolo.&quot;<br /><br />Initiation<br /><br />History<br />The solvents are beginning to be used as a drug of abuse by 1960 in the United States. In Brazil, the use of solvents Appear in the period 1965-1970.<br />Chloroform and ether cam serves to drugs of abuse in other times and after its use was abandoned Virtually. In Brazil, the habit came back with the spear-scents Brought from Argentina. Chloroform is known since 1847 to an anesthetic but was abandoned because it Appeared more efficient and safer anesthetics. Also Thus occurred with ether. There are references to the abuse of alcohol ether as a substitute During the Second World War in Germany.<br /><br />By 1960, the fragrance launches, Which were made of Ethyl Chloride, Began to be piped to give a sense of numbness, dizziness and euphoria. The Quelene, local anesthetic, with the pair formed inhalants and was employed outside of times of Carnival, When the availability of fragrance launches was smaller. By 1965, the Brazilian government banned the manufacture of perfume launches and Quelene. However, Began to emerge return references to the use of spear-perfumes, only one product base of chloroform and ether.<br /><br />Initiation<br /><br />Mechanism of Action<br />The with the alcohol solvents are substances Which have a biphasic effect, ie cause the initial excitation, Followed by depression of brain function That depends on the dose inhaled.<br />After inhalation, the solvents reach the alveoli and pulmonary Capillaries and are distributed across lipid membranes in the body. The peak plasma concentration is Reached Within 15 to 30 minutes. Metabolism is variable: nitrates and aromatic hydrocarbons are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal system. Some solvents have active metabolites more potent than the parent compound. Disposal can be kidney or lung.<br /><br />Nearly all inhalants, except for nitrites, produce pleasurable effects and central nervous system depressants. Toluene, a chemical found in products such as paints, adhesives and removers, Appears to act by activating the dopamine system. This neural system is related to addiction. It is Responsible for feelings of pleasure Associated with drug use, as well as other naturally rewarding behaviors such as eating, fri and quench thirst.<br /><br />Moreover, nitrite, also known as &quot;poppers&quot; and currently manufactured for the purpose of cleaning and deodorizing clothes and utensils environment produces the effect of relaxation and dilation of blood vessels and are used as a drug of abuse to better sexual performance.<br /><br />Initiation<br /><br />Effects on the Body<br />The onset of effects, after aspiration, is quite fast - from seconds to minutes at most - and in 15 to 40 minutes longer disappear. Thus, the user repeats the aspirations Repeatedly to the sensations That last longer.<br />The effects of solvents ranging from an initial stimulation to depression and may Arise Also hallucinatory processes. Several authors Say That the effects of solvents (whatever) resemble Those of alcohol, However, this does not produce hallucinations, is well Described for the solvents.<br /><br />Among the effects, depression is prevalent, Especially Brain Functioning. According to the onset of these effects Following inhalation of solvents, were divided into four phases:<br /><br />First phase: the so-called phase excitation, Which is what you want, because the person Becomes euphoric, excited Apparently, feeling dizzy and having auditory and visual disturbances. But They Also Appear can nausea, sneezing, coughing, drooling a lot and faces can be reddened.<br /><br />Second phase: depression of the brain begins to predominate, leaving the person confused, disoriented, his voice slurred middle, blurred vision, loss of self-control, headache, pallor, she starts seeing or hearing things.<br /><br />Third phase: depression deepens with marked Reduction of alertness, incoordination eye (the person can no longer fix Their Eyes on objects), incoordination with wobbly gait, speech &quot;rolled&quot;, depressed reflexes, occurring processes evident hallucinatory.<br /><br />Fourth phase: depression late, Which can reach the unconscious, pressure drop, strange dreams, the person may still present outbreaks of seizures (&quot;attacks&quot;). This phase Occurs frequently among those &quot;sniffers&quot; that use plastic bag and, after a time, no longer Able to remove him from the nose and intoxication Thus Becomes very dangerous and can even lead to coma and death.<br />Finally, it is known That the repeated aspiration, chronic solvents can lead to destruction of neurons (brain cells), Causing irreversible damage to the brain. In addition, people who use solvents are presented chronically apathetic, have difficulty concentrating and memory deficits.<br /><br />Initiation<br /><br />Negative Consequences<br />The solvents Practically not damage other organs except the brain. However, there is a phenomenon produced by solvents That can be very dangerous. These make the human heart more sensitive to the substance That our body produces, the adrenaline, Which makes the number of heartbeats increase.<br />Adrenaline is released every time we have to Exert extra effort, such as running, playing sports etc. .. Certain Thus, if a person inhales the solvent and soon makes physical exertion, your heart can Suffer, because he is very sensitive to adrenaline released from the effort. The medical literature has cited Several cases of death from cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), Particularly for adolescents.<br /><br />When inhaled The solvents can lead to chronic lesions of bone marrow, kidney, liver and peripheral nerves That muscle control. For example, it Has Been found in other countries, in Which shoe factories or workshops in painting, workers, over time, ended up presenting renal and liver diseases. As a result, these countries went into effect strict legislation on the ventilation conditions of these plants, and Brazil has laws Also Regarding.<br /><br />In some cases, Especially When there is an impurity in the solvent, benzene, even in small Amounts, can lead to Decreased production of white and red cells in the body.<br /><br />One of the most used solvents in adhesives is our n-hexane. This substance is very toxic to peripheral nerves, producing progressive degeneration as to cause upheavals in the floor (people end up walking with difficulty, called the &quot;duck walk&quot;), and may even get to paralysis. There are cases of chronic users after a few years That, could only get around in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Other Reasons Associated suffocation deaths from inhalants are - accidents using a plastic bag, since at the team inhalation of the person places the bag on the head and can suffocate; drops - the solvents cause vertigo and dizziness, Which Could lead to falls and motor vehicle collisions, due to incoordination and loss of reflexes.<br /><br />► Dependence<br />The dependence among Those chronically abused solvents is common, the components being psychic dependence on the clearest such as desire to use the substance, loss of interest other than the solvent.<br /><br />The abstinence syndrome, although of low intensity, is present in the abrupt cessation of these drugs, it is common anxiety, agitation, tremors, leg cramps and insomnia.<br /><br />Substance tolerance may Arise, although not as dramatic Compared to other drugs (such as amphetamines, Which are dependent taking doses 50-70 times larger than the original). Depending on the person and the solvent settles the tolerance after one to two months.<br /><br />► During pregnancy consumption<br />The solvent consumption During pregnancy Increases the Risks of prematurity, prenatal death, abnormalities in growth and tables similar to fetal alcohol syndrome (microcephaly, facial malformations, cardiovascular, bone and kidney). There is no definitive information Regarding the carcinogenic potential of solvents on humans.<br /><br />Initiation<br /><br />Consumption in Brazil<br />According to II Household Survey on the Use of Psychotropic Drugs in Brazil - study of the 108 largest cities, Conducted in 2005 by the National Antidrug Secretariat - in partnership with Senad Cebrid / Unifesp and 7939 Involving people, between 12 and 65 - Revealed That the Total users of solvents was higher for ailments (10.3%) than for females (3.3%).<br />The most prevalent male occurred in all age groups except That of 12-17. The largest amount of respondents reporting lifetime use occurred in the age group 18-24 years.<br /><br />The number of dependents, According to the criteria of SAMHSA, was 0.23% of respondents, and 0.27% among men and 0.20% for women. In the age group 12-17 years, the percentage Reached 0.81%.

				It looks like I was right.&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp;They used to sell this stuff in head shops under the name &quot;rush&quot; back in the 1980&#039;s but now I guess they are also marketing it as &quot;liquid incense&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you can still order the stuff online.&nbsp; Here is a website.&nbsp; http://www.rush-poppers.org/
