				Hello friends,<br /><br />this is my first official post but i have been using this and SR platform for a longer time. To the point.. I have had some success perhaps with the entity of this joyful venture of the establishment of SR! Well I want to go deeper into the rabbit hole.. I want to expand my undertakings and make my first big order, which is going to take some time and effort looking at the difficulties of this task. I would like to make this order very soon and I would like to have some input on this, regarding all the security measures that needs to be taken. This deal is about TH4C and I can message vendor on the priv. note if someone has experience with this particular guy. Shipping options would be a P.O. box (which might be too small) or a home address.

				Turn back NEO !<br /><br />Don&#039;t take the red pill.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get out whe you still can.&nbsp; You&#039;ll end up broke, addicted, in the hospital and possibly in jail.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Or you might end up happy and fullfilled.<br /><br />&nbsp; Is the government and all those researchers lying to you about drugs?&nbsp; Or are they all right?<br /><br />Are you prepared to take the chance?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Are you ready NEO ?<br /><br />Blue or red pill.&nbsp; What will it be ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to your boring predicable life , or down the rabbit hope to a bold new world.&nbsp; <br />

				Yes yes the red pill is the only option to all of this mess! I prefer being in the hospital with an addiction with empty pockets and cops waiting to drag me down to the joy division of endless butt-rape whilst regurgitating tons of red pills, rather than polish the cock of some big gov. agenda! Funny though.. please some informal and constructive comments!

				I just though of something. Maybe when you do place your order place it from a different computer then you usually use and also get a new user name. <br /><br />and make sure who ever you buy from is using moisture barrier bags, and also as another safety precaution don&#039;t buy internationally.<br /><br />
