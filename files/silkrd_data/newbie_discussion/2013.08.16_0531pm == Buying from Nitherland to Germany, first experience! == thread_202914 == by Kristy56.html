				Hi, as i wrote in one of&nbsp; my topics, i have ordered a great hash, it was my first experience in it on SR.<br />The seller is like King Kong of SR, the best listing and best pricing!<br />After 2-nd shipping or reshipping i have not my item.<br />And i have to trust to the seller that he has send the item, as he has good feedback and more experience. But i don&#039;t trust that the reshipping is also failed. And the seller try to get time always, asking wait and wait more. What to do in the situation? Bozz, where are you??? :)

				Probably i was wrong, as the seller did not reship me &quot;not arrived&quot; item, he, the seller, just wanted to get time, he was hoping that the item would arrive later. And now the item is &quot;not arrived&quot;, i am offered to get 50% refund from the seller. What about me, i don&#039;t trust, that the seller really send me the item, but it&#039;s just my thoughts. But i don&#039;t trust in post problems also. What to do now, accept seller&#039;s offer with 50% refund or wait till Resolution?<br />

				I dont know his conditions and shit, but if his profile page reads 50% refund the resolution center isnt going to give you anything more.<br />There is always the option to ask nicely for a reship.<br />Well...and that is pretty much it.<br />It is sad to hear that your first experience was a bad one.<br />Maybe next time try a different vendor, do some decent research, read some forum threads and you should be good to go

The post works very good, like &quot;good-tuned&quot; system, the post is the one of the best post services around the world, the seller is also OK(probably), but the item is &quot;not arrived&quot;. And next time, if i want buy something from the seller again, i will not get any refund in the case of fail. I don&#039;t understand the moment, is it mean, that i don&#039;t get any refund from the seller, or that mean, that i don&#039;t get any refund at all?

				And now i see feedback of the seller, his item is &quot;not arrived&quot; to me, and people write practically in each feedback, that&#039;s all OK, the items is &quot;not arrived&quot;, but communication is good, the seller offered me 50% refund and so, and so, but final feedback mostly 5/5. They did not get their orders, they have only 50% refund and again 5/5 feedback. I am new here, and 50% refund i will get in any case, by the resolution(of course, i just think so), but i have no wish to estimate&nbsp; 5/5 any seller only for his communication and for his refund. Any seller must have &quot;good communication&quot; if he is a seller. I think, that each of us must estimate the result as &quot;arrived&quot; or &quot;not arrived&quot; as very important result, the new guys here, on SR, are looking very often&nbsp; only on feedback(and the price), then they buy something. I did so, for example. And then, when an item is &quot;not arrived&quot;, new people here really don&#039;t know what to do in the situation. As a reward for our patience we have &quot;good communication&quot; and 50% refund. But now i can think that it&#039;s may be a business of some sellers from SR, they did not ship any items and they have 50% of money. And also they have 5/5, they try strongly to have it. <br /><br />What you think about, members?
