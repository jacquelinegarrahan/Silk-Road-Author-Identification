				Was going to post to his vender review thread, but I&#039;m too much of a newbie to have access to that area, so....<br /><br />I&#039;ll post here what a great vender this is. Quality product sent quickly and discreetly. Dealt gently with this newbie. <br /><br />A cool drink of water in the cannabis desert.

				I&#039;m in the so I figured I&#039;d post in here. My product also arrived discretely and quickly.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t even sure what it was until I opened it because I had other non-SR stuff coming as well.&nbsp; The past few days when the mail truck was coming I was hiding in the shadows like a fucking ninja so I could watch and make sure it was the same mailman that always comes.&nbsp; A lot of that had to do with reading up about controlled deliveries but seeing how he handled the stealth aspect really eased my mind.<br /><br />Side note:&nbsp; I think I got a little too excited because after I opened it I went downstairs to test it out and fell down the damn stairs :). <br /><br />Anyway, thanks NCC for a great first experience!

				Pretty sure it comes in multiple layers of FoodSaver-style vacuum bags, but I could be wrong and he might have changed it. Best to ask him to be sure...Of course you might have been asking him by posting your question, in which case I apologize for butting in.
