				Hi all. Total noob here.<br />If i was to order a small! amount of class B drugs to my own address but under a different name<br />and the worse was to happen and it got intercepted. Could my computer get seized or would i just get<br />charged with possession .<br />Im not worried about being charged since with the amount planned to order i would get nothing but a fine max.<br />But is it possible at all like any chance that my computer could get seized cause of it.<br />thanks

				What reason would they have to seize your computer?&nbsp; In America, they wouldn&#039;t bother.&nbsp; That costs money and takes time and experts.&nbsp; Not worth it.

				not even if you are ordering class A drugs, as long as we are talking small amounts.<br />law enforcement is a gov. funded department like any other - they have a certain budget and not endless money supply, at least non to crack down on small-time consumers

				As mention by Self, here in the states if it&#039;s a small amount, it&#039;s not worth their time. Not sure how the laws are in the UK but I expect small amount wouldn&#039;t be worth their time either...In the security thread there&#039;s a sticky with instructions on booting a secure OS through a thumb drive and looking into truecrypt doesn&#039;t hurt. <br /><br />Also, that address is now burnt and flagged.
