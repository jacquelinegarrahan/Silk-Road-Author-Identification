				I see that the samplers have been found (and that doesn&#039;t surprise me at all&nbsp; ;) ). <br /><br />But I just want to congratulate Railgun for his smart reply on this post: do use testing kits!!! <br />Also, I mentioned this many times before - but I strongly suggest that vendors who are looking for samplers make their selection depending on their needs from the list of Reliable Reviewers (see my signature). <br />The people on this list often have testing kits, they have proven to be trustworthy and they have an active forum presence (most of them)... toooo many scammers are foaming this forum looking for free stuff (not pointing fingers to anyone, just stating the obvious). <br /><br />If people who are sampling this C wish to be added to the list of Reliable Reviewers, just contact the guy who&#039;s handling that list (and keeping it up-to-date), he&#039;ll check if you do have the qualifications to be on that list and if you do he&#039;ll add you to the list... and you&#039;ll be an official &quot;Reliable Reviewer&quot;...

				And may I ask how you came to the conclusion of 95-100? And please don&#039;t tell me you have used reagents because most of the time they are wack and you dont really know. Would be nice to know what method you used to test the purity.<br /><br />Cheers

				Glad you asked. this cocaine is really fluffy not so much flaky like I heard pure cocaine is, plus it hardly has any shine to it. But its the best i&#039;ve ever tried so i did some tests:<br /><br />FEEL TEST-The simplest is the feel test. In this test all you need are clean, dry hands. Take your index finger and press it into a small pile of chopped or screened cocaine hydrochloride. Then take what adheres to your finger (1/4 of a line is sufficient) and press it against your thumb pad. After a second or two gently rub thumb and forefinger in a circular motion. The coke should melt and feel very slick and oily, about the feel of fine machine oil. Any sticky or gritty feeling is a sign of adulterants. It&#039;s amazing how often this simple test will show its value.<br /><br />TASTE TEST-Warning:because there may be undesirable adulterants in your sample, use caution. Take a little cocaine on your finger and put it on the tip of your tongue. The taste should be bitter, but not terribly so, and there should not be an immediate or quick freeze (numbing). Rather, it should take a couple of minutes before you feel the anesthetic effect. The numb should not seem super intense, yet it should be definite, with an almost &quot;chill effect. If it&#039;s metallic or bites severely, it&#039;s probably cut with a synthetic caine and is to be avoided. Pure cocaine has a more organic taste; it&#039;s somewhat bitter but not sharp to the tongue.<br /><br />TINFOIL TEST-Cocaine will, upon being heated to its vapor point, completely evaporate, leaving a stain where it had been, but no residue. However, there are several other substances commonly used as adulterants which will do likewise. Therefore, lack of residue is not proof of purity, but residue is an almost certain proof of adulteration.<br /><br />Take a strip (about 2&quot; by 6&quot;) of clean, unwrinkled tinfoil (I prefer heavy gauge) and curve it lengthwise into a smooth, elongated valley. Take a small (5mg or1/4 of a line) sample of the toot in question and drop it on the foil about an inch and a half from one end, in the center of the valley. Holding the other end of the foil, heat the sample from underneath carefully with a match or flame. Keep the flame, yet close enough for the heat to be sufficient to vaporize the sample. When the sample has been heated to the point where no more smoke or reaction is evident, remove the heat source and allow a moment for the foil to cool. Placing the foil on a smooth, flat surface, take your index finger and and firmly press and pull it across the burned spot where the sample evaporated. There should be no residue visible upon your finger. There should be a stain of amber to dark brown color visible on the foil.<br /><br />The appearance of any residue is an almost certain indication of adulteration.<br /><br />WATER TEST-Drop a small, finely-screened amount of cocaine (at least 1/2 a line) in a clean, clear, tall glass of plain water. Clean coke is highly soluble in water. Upon hitting the surface, it will dissolve with almost explosive speed, leaving transparent trailers as the particles descend (the only adulterant to impart similar trails being procaine hydrochloride).<br /><br />CHLORINE TEST-The best simple test for discerning the presence of synthetic caine drugs (anesthetic adulterants) in your cocaine is the chlorine test. Virtually all of the synthetic cuts react positively to the bleach test and reliably produce an orange-red or dull brick-red residue on the surface of the bleach. Since the synthetic caines are not removed by the base process, they are of prime concern.<br /><br />To perform the test, use a freshly opened (unoxidized) bottle of chlorine bleach (Clorox, Purex, etc). Fill a clear, tall (8oz to12oz) glass with the chlorine solution. Run a small line (10mg) of the sample through a fine screen, or chop diligently with a razor blade. Care must be taken not to contaminate the sample with any precious cocaine (etc) residues. Even minute amounts of contaminants could affect the test results. Gently drop the pulverized sample into the center of the bleach solution.<br /><br />The sample should hesitate on the surface 5-15 seconds before starting its milky descent. Spiraling downward, the particles should dissolve on or before reaching the bottom. Particles which break out of formation or fall with no trail are usually sugars (mannite, sucrose, lactose, etc). These pose no threat as they are removed in processing.<br /><br /><br />And finally I used the EZ test for purity and cuts. It just confirmed what I knew and gave me a picture to post.<br />what convinced me was finding out there were no cuts and the way it dissolved in water. it was immediate, it left trailers about half way down the glass before disappearing completely. But still this is my first contact with pure coke. thats why the 10 free samples. <br />

				Some people just have no clue, but Jean, I think you made a very good explanation and I think you deserve some credit for the post and hopefully people will have a little more faith,<br /><br />NOTE to other users, TEST KITS are complete shite and waste of money, they can never guarantee you results and besides these days there are so much additives that mimic the characteristics of cocaine that you would end up with a false positive, if people really wanna test their shit, almost every method Jean wrote above is good me and for most people, Jean knows whats hes talking about and his methods are spot on!<br /><br />Nice one pal<br /><br />Cheers

But its the best i&#039;ve ever tried so i did some tests:<br /><br />FEEL TEST-The simplest is the feel test. In this test all you need are clean, dry hands. Take your index finger and press it into a small pile of chopped or screened cocaine hydrochloride. Then take what adheres to your finger (1/4 of a line is sufficient) and press it against your thumb pad. After a second or two gently rub thumb and forefinger in a circular motion. The coke should melt and feel very slick and oily, about the feel of fine machine oil. Any sticky or gritty feeling is a sign of adulterants. It&#039;s amazing how often this simple test will show its value.<br /><br />TASTE TEST-Warning:because there may be undesirable adulterants in your sample, use caution. Take a little cocaine on your finger and put it on the tip of your tongue. The taste should be bitter, but not terribly so, and there should not be an immediate or quick freeze (numbing). Rather, it should take a couple of minutes before you feel the anesthetic effect. The numb should not seem super intense, yet it should be definite, with an almost &quot;chill effect. If it&#039;s metallic or bites severely, it&#039;s probably cut with a synthetic caine and is to be avoided. Pure cocaine has a more organic taste; it&#039;s somewhat bitter but not sharp to the tongue.<br /><br />TINFOIL TEST-Cocaine will, upon being heated to its vapor point, completely evaporate, leaving a stain where it had been, but no residue. However, there are several other substances commonly used as adulterants which will do likewise. Therefore, lack of residue is not proof of purity, but residue is an almost certain proof of adulteration.<br /><br />Take a strip (about 2&quot; by 6&quot;) of clean, unwrinkled tinfoil (I prefer heavy gauge) and curve it lengthwise into a smooth, elongated valley. Take a small (5mg or1/4 of a line) sample of the toot in question and drop it on the foil about an inch and a half from one end, in the center of the valley. Holding the other end of the foil, heat the sample from underneath carefully with a match or flame. Keep the flame, yet close enough for the heat to be sufficient to vaporize the sample. When the sample has been heated to the point where no more smoke or reaction is evident, remove the heat source and allow a moment for the foil to cool. Placing the foil on a smooth, flat surface, take your index finger and and firmly press and pull it across the burned spot where the sample evaporated. There should be no residue visible upon your finger. There should be a stain of amber to dark brown color visible on the foil.<br /><br />The appearance of any residue is an almost certain indication of adulteration.<br /><br />WATER TEST-Drop a small, finely-screened amount of cocaine (at least 1/2 a line) in a clean, clear, tall glass of plain water. Clean coke is highly soluble in water. Upon hitting the surface, it will dissolve with almost explosive speed, leaving transparent trailers as the particles descend (the only adulterant to impart similar trails being procaine hydrochloride).<br /><br />CHLORINE TEST-The best simple test for discerning the presence of synthetic caine drugs (anesthetic adulterants) in your cocaine is the chlorine test. Virtually all of the synthetic cuts react positively to the bleach test and reliably produce an orange-red or dull brick-red residue on the surface of the bleach. Since the synthetic caines are not removed by the base process, they are of prime concern.<br /><br />To perform the test, use a freshly opened (unoxidized) bottle of chlorine bleach (Clorox, Purex, etc). Fill a clear, tall (8oz to12oz) glass with the chlorine solution. Run a small line (10mg) of the sample through a fine screen, or chop diligently with a razor blade. Care must be taken not to contaminate the sample with any precious cocaine (etc) residues. Even minute amounts of contaminants could affect the test results. Gently drop the pulverized sample into the center of the bleach solution.<br /><br />The sample should hesitate on the surface 5-15 seconds before starting its milky descent. Spiraling downward, the particles should dissolve on or before reaching the bottom. Particles which break out of formation or fall with no trail are usually sugars (mannite, sucrose, lactose, etc). These pose no threat as they are removed in processing.<br /><br /><br />And finally I used the EZ test for purity and cuts. It just confirmed what I knew and gave me a picture to post.<br />what convinced me was finding out there were no cuts and the way it dissolved in water. it was immediate, it left trailers about half way down the glass before disappearing completely. But still this is my first contact with pure coke. thats why the 10 free samples.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very good post!<br />This one is worth copy-pasting into a few other threads as well... <br />I leave you the honor to do such as soon as you reached your 50 post and are free to roam the forum unlimited...&nbsp; :)<br /><br />+1 for the detailed testing explanation (I already gave you that a few days ago). <br /><br />Best of luck to your business

				I hear you can&#039;t do 100% cocaine, you will die!<br /><br />The highest % I&#039;ve supposedly ever had was about 90-95% and it was tan in color and shiny.&nbsp; Everyone that tried it threw up, just even the smallest line!&nbsp; This was about 4 years ago when you could buy an ounce of that quality for $700...now days, you&#039;re lucky if you can get in the 80% and the cost is about $1100-$1300 per ounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;It has to be somewhat good where I&#039;m from cuz the people over here like to smoke it.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t get is how come they say it&#039;s at 80% and when you cook it, all of it comes back? IDK cuz I&#039;m not an expert at that kind of stuff.<br /><br />One way that I always know if it&#039;s good or not is the feel test. Depending on how fast the residue on your fingers turn oily tells you how good it is.&nbsp; Usually with&nbsp; the shit I only snort up my nose, I would wipe my finger across the plate we would be doing lines off of, and even with that lil residue left over my fingers would still be pretty oily.&nbsp; I can say that I&#039;m blessed to come across good cocaine now days, i&#039;ve seen some terrific blow lately and all these people think they&#039;re fucking Al Pacino cuz they can do 1gram lines of baby powder!!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D

				Dude, <br />your actual listing is for 0.0 BTC... <br />if you want to make a listing for samples, better to do that in &quot;stealth mode&quot; or as a custom order so that people who visit your page don&#039;t end up ordering your samples... as I just did :-P
