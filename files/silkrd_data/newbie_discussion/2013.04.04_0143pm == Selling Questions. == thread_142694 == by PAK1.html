				This spammer, bnersh434, sent my post to the 3rd page. does the guy believe he will do nay sales at all?<br /><br />So here it goes my question:<br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />I have access to some substances i would like to sell in SR. I can get them at reasonable prices and provide good stuff in SR at decent prices. I did a lot of research regarding security, and how to sell on SR an be safe. I think i can do that now. The bound is not a problem either. The big problem is, how do i get to exchange BC&#039;s for $.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.

				That is a tough one to answer here. Most vendors will not talk about it. Sorry dude. Research here and the clearnet as well :)

				The best idea i do have is to have some one, not related with this having a mtgox account opened and simply send the BC&#039;s to him and pay him a fee on each transaction. I can try that but i dont know if thats secure enough.

				But his bank will still ask questions because of anti money laundering rules and regs. Is he going to be able to explain multiple transfers to his account with no real proof of where they are coming from? Banks can and will ask questions and if they are not answered correctly they have procedures they need to follow.

				Well if you&#039;re in the UK you could use BTC4CASH UK&#039;s services or someone where you are. <br /><br />There are vendors on the road that sell CASH-OUT methods. i.e. You pay big bucks and they tell you how to do it. Not good :((<br /><br />Too expensive. I think Limetless was charging 150 BTC.<br /><br />Or you can figure this out for yourself. Every vendor has.

				Or ask a vendor you have ordered with or some top ranking vendors for advice? They may not share their info but its worth a shot.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142694.msg975631#msg975631">Quote from: 4tron on April 04, 2013, 02:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well if you&#039;re in the UK you could use BTC4CASH UK&#039;s services or someone where you are. <br /><br />There are vendors on the road that sell CASH-OUT methods. i.e. You pay big bucks and they tell you how to do it.

Testing the water first, but it will definitely be implemented soon. Thanks for the recommendation though 4Tron
