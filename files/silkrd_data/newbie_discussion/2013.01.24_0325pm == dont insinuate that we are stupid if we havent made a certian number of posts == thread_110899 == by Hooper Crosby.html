				I could be wrong, but I don&#039;t think i&#039;m the only one who gets the feeling that some mods look down on users with less posts than them as being stupid, or somehow unworthy of being on the main forum. <br /><br />I don&#039;t appreciate the insinuation by some of the mods that &quot;noobs&quot; are stupid, and we need to be segregated to the newbie section until we can learn to play with the big kids. This is a completely false notion.&nbsp; Mods who make insinuations like these only do so to perpetuate their own elitist mentality, and to give themselves some sense of self worth for making&nbsp; thousands of posts.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason DPR changed the rules is to limit spammers and scamers. Lets just leave it at that!&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have anything to do with the disparity in experience between a member with 10 posts, or a member with 10,000 posts.&nbsp; In all actuality, people with thousands of posts can do more damage than someone with a couple hundred posts, if all they do is talk out their ass hole.<br /><br />I know i&#039;m still relatively new, but I&#039;ve been on SR for about 6 months, and have a number of successful transactions behind my belt. I don&#039;t appreciate being told by some oily skinned moderator with dried semen stains on his pant leg that just because I don&#039;t spend all day alone in my 1 bedroom apartment with my cats, posting on this forum, I am somehow not worthy of being in the main forum.<br /><br />From this point forward, lets cut out the negative dialog towards people in this section as being inexperienced, or not knowing what we are doing.&nbsp; The decision to limit users under a certain number of posts to this section was made purely to limit scams and spams, as with every other forum on the internet with the same policy.&nbsp; Not to belittle or alienate an entire sub-community of users.

				Nobody accually insinuated this??<br /><br />Do you really want to go back to a forum RIDDLED with scammer&#039;s spam?<br /><br />Accually,this is the only forum that responds to almost everyone in mostly a positive manner and is very helpfull.

				OP took information I posted and craved it into something that would fit nicely into his troll agenda in an effort to spread misinformation, I in no way said anything OP claims.<br />I&#039;ll even give you the thread url ro read and judge for yourself. :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109864.0<br /><br />Here is the thread and you will find with my posts that I simply created an answer to a question in an effort to keep the entire forum at calm but instead made a mistake and didn&#039;t realized I did more harm than good which as soon as I woke up sober this morning and saw what I had posted not only did I post a retraction on my comment but apologized to the senior members in an honest effort to find the truth i glossed over yesterday.<br /><br />Do not let trolls use misdirection guys it&#039;s their easiest way to start trouble within the community.<br />X)

				Hi OP - I think you are taking things to heart too much!&nbsp; <br /><br />You know that it doesn&#039;t matter a stuff whether someone thinks you are stupid or not.&nbsp; Why worry about what they think?&nbsp; What matters is your intention and your mind and your life.&nbsp; It&#039;s a setting on a bit of software on a forum.&nbsp; It&#039;s not about your intelligence level... and if someone makes it about that, what they are trying to say ceases to make sense.

				I enjoyed the part about the dried semen stain on the leg. I think OP is a bit too butthurt though, I was in the middle of a deep and whimsical discussion about time and the function of consciousness or some shit when I was ejected from the other forums and you don&#039;t see me crying like a little bitch.
