				You need to read before you start.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read up for like 3 months before I even posted, let alone ordered something.<br /><br />Wallet... you already have a wallet in your SR account<br /><br />Escrow is automatic, you don&#039;t need to do anything.<br /><br />Bitcoins... go to localbitcoins.com<br /><br />Surf around the forum and read... go to bitcoin exchanges and read.

				You need to buy bitcoins from a external service like localbitcoins&nbsp; etc try google search buy bitcoin in country&nbsp; then you need to send the btc to sr then you can buy <br /><br />Please read the buyers guide and the wiki in full before making a purchase

				okay lets say i buy them off localbitcoins.com; am i able to buy with a prepaid visa? so that way its annoymous and cannot link back to me... ALso lets say after purchasing them they go to my multibit wallet; and then from there i transfer them from my bitcoin wallet to my SR wallet. does it keep track of where i transferred the bitcoins too? wouldn&#039;t want to get any negative attention that way..

				Why bother with a prepaid visa when you can just walk into a bank and drop off the money?... or just meet someone?&nbsp; Not sure any sellers there would take visa.<br /><br />Why transfer your coin to your multibit?... just go straight to SR.

				Even if you bought them using your real info just use a tumbler service and voila no one knows who you are. That coupled with SR&#039;s tumbler makes it difficult to trace back

				For my first bitcoin purchase I used localbitcoins, met in person exchanged cash and deposited straight into my SR account, pretty sure it doesn&#039;t get more anonymous than it. If anything I imagine the bitcoins I&#039;m using trace back to the seller (if even possible).
