				Long story short: I have 3 items &quot;Processing&quot; right now. They&#039;ve all been processing for 25 hours now. One is a marijuana order (1/8th, one is 2C-B (100mg) and one is an Instant-Lotto win I had last night which still hasn&#039;t been credited. <br /><br />How long does it usually take for the sellers to contact you after pressing buy? At what point do you get worried?

				It really depends on the vendor, a lot of times it says on the vendor page how long it will take for the order to be sent. If I pay for express and need something asap I might message the vendor a day after I expected the order to be marked in transit but in I am rarely in a hurry so that doesn&#039;t happen much. There&#039;s no need to worry though, as long as you&#039;re in escrow you should be okay.

				My first order (1g of MDMA) was put in without any communication to the vendor. Received the package without sharing one word with the vendor.<br /><br />When I put in my 2nd order (different vendor) the vendor responded to my order within 24 hours.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think communication with the vendor is vital but at the same time it is reassuring. Just wait a bit and give it some time. Patience seems to be key.<br /><br />If you are that worried and your orders are still processing then just cancel them and message the vendor about their policies.

				I&#039;m going to send a short message when the item is shipped. I like to get that when I order so I&#039;ll do the same to my customers.

				I&#039;m probably just a bit anxious because these are my first true orders.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t get why the guy who works the &quot;Instant 50/50 Lotto&quot; hasn&#039;t paid me a day later though, not very &quot;instant&quot; (no I didn&#039;t FE or anything, still in escrow).

				I think it would be a good habit to be contacting a vendor at the before or after the point of sale.<br /><br />Obviously, if things were pleasant for you.. let the vendor know. They wouldnt mind.<br /><br />

Just was wondering if its usual to have orders still in the &quot;Processing&quot; stage for a day or two with no vendor contact whatsoever.

Damn, that is fucking fast. I&#039;ve sat here for a few hours now just waiting for something magical to happen. For them to change status, for me to get a message, anything.
