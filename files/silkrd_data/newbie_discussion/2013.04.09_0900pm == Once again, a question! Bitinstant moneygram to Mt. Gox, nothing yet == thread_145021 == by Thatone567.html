				I sent a moneygram on Sunday (the 7th) using bitinstant to my Mt. Gox account. It should still be in USD as I didn&#039;t choose to automatically convert to bitcoins. <br />My Mt. Gox account still hasn&#039;t received anything, and though it says it takes three business days to receive money from wiring, I&#039;ve been hearing lots of complaints on r/silkroad about bitinstant not sending money, causing me to be paranoid.<br />I did get a confirmation e-mail from ZipZap on the 7th with my account number, and I have a receipt from the location I went to in order to send the moneygram.<br /><br />Is this a problem with bitinstant, or Mt. Gox?

				Bitinstant. Their service is terrible and only getting worse. You&#039;ll get your BTC, but as for when, your guess is as good as mine.

				Thank you.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve been wondering if, after I&#039;ve converted my USD to BTC, (let&#039;s say I put in $50 and it becomes .2127 BTC at first), the &#039;bubble&#039; pops and bitcoins lose their value while my bitcoins are in my SR wallet, will I get screwed over while trying to buy something from a vendor? What if I begin the process, and my money goes into escrow, then the value drops? I&#039;ve been told to see if my vendor has a hedge option, but I&#039;m not sure what that entails, other than knowing that a hedge is something that is used to prevent losses.

				I dont hedge my sales. What is means is that:<br /><br />Example 1<br /><br />Bitcoin increase during escrow&nbsp; =&nbsp; Seller, not you, make $$$$<br /><br />Example 2<br /><br />Bitcoin Decrease during escrow&nbsp; =&nbsp; You make out like a bandit. When the seller transfers to fiat currency, the $100, when received is worth $10, Seller loses money.<br /><br />Hedgeing = Price is fixed to fiat currency. When you make a purchase for $100 the seller receives $100 regardless of bitcoin price, but it cost the seller a fee that is passed to the consumer.<br /><br />Hopes this helps,<br />SFd

				Prob is definitely with bitinstant. I&#039;ve always had great luck with bitinstant although yesterday it took about 2 hrs for payment to reach mtgox.&nbsp; <br /><br />Check out mtgox twitter acct, it looks like you aren&#039;t the only one who has had problems the past few days.&nbsp; I&#039;d contact bitinstant support (mtgox can&#039;t help with this).&nbsp; BI should *not* take 3 days, only a wire transfer directly from your bank will. <br /><br />Most of the time it takes a minute or two.&nbsp; But as I said, been some crazy high volume lately so I think they&#039;re just getting backed-up or bugged or somethig.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway try their support and hope for the best.&nbsp; It will get there sometime.
