				These seem to be cheap as shit on here in comparison - seems to be a lot of bitching &quot; I don&#039;t touch those shitty research chems... no telling of long term effects&quot; etc. But what is the actual trip like? say in comparison to LSD? would you recommend trying it? have there been any negative affects reported? (ignoring idiots who do 10 strips or think they can fly etc...???<br />Thanks!

				Thanks for the reply prettyshroomgirl! your name conjours up naughty images in my head, probably my 3 top qualities in a partner, attractive, interested in psychedelics and female (although your probably a fat bloke in his 50&#039;s with a hairy arse!)

				IMO not much Difference in RC´s and other chemical Drugs never know 100% what you take until you get it Labtested...<br /><br />But you can tell the Difference between LSD and NBOMs.<br /><br />LSD lasts much longer then NBOMs for instance...

				Ok, so people saying its different to LSD and &quot;a lot of fun&quot;.<br />But what does that mean? putting smarties tubes on my cats legs and making it walk downstairs is a lot of fun, but I wouldn&#039;t choose it over a good LSD trip!

				lol @ being a fat harry ass guy<br />heavy on visuals, but its like.. they miss the love that lsd has.. its not a trip where you break down and find god. you know that its not lsd. again though its one wild ride. <br />if i were you, id order some from theindigochild and try it myself. they are fun, but clearly not lsd.

				yea, I suppose like any other drug experience its indescribable to anyone who hasn&#039;t experienced it and I suppose I will have to order some myself and see (does it have cross=tolerance with LSD?).<br /><br />Well thanks for the replies, what i&#039;m assuming is you get the LSD-type visuals (fuck my teddy bear is turning into a vision of satan!!) but not the psychological &#039;insights&#039; and sense of peace and understanding that LSD brings?<br /><br />All in all a poor mans LSD?

				@prettyshroomgirl: On the other Hand it´s a nice Way to experience good Visuals without the hvy. Mindfuck LSD gives you sometimes (the Opposite of &quot;finding God&quot; you know^^).<br />I would say:<br /><br />Visuals = LSD<br />Mindfuck &gt; LSD<br />Bodyload &lt; LSD <br />

				Thanks for that balfor. I understand w/LSD sometimes (especially for new users) visuals can be interesting experience but psychological &quot;mindfuck&quot; can be &#039;unsettling&#039;! depends what you are expecting/looking for.<br /><br />BTW what country u from?

				I&#039;ve had plenty of ego death reports on from users on 25i&nbsp; not so much 25c users ( though ive heard it once) I&#039;d have to agree that they&#039;re more for the stereo typical trip very fun with a group and easy on first timers.&nbsp; I&#039;d say 25i is more like LSD because it has the same introspective deepness.&nbsp; but they are very cheap and priced so you distributing street level can make a easy living, think of NBOME as the LSD of the future same price different time period! and more flavors to choose from ;) we&#039;ll have 25b and lsz soon. But that&#039;s not till I start promoting this White on White hard core.

				I can only comment on 25i and lsd. Comparing both, well apples and oranges.&nbsp; Also depends on dosage but 25i is a lot more potent. So maybe more &quot;bang for your buck&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend lsd for first timers.&nbsp; 25i is alright as first time too but might be too harsh for some people. It&#039;d be like riding rollercoaster(25i) vs merry go round (lsd) for the first time.

				Thanks for this thread. After reading this I am definitely picking up some 25i from IndigoChild. This will be my first order, can&#039;t wait!
