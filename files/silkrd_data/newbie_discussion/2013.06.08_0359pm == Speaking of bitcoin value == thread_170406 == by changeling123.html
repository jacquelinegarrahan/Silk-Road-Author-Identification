				When do you think is the best time to buy the coins? The value of a bitcoin is very unstable, but dollar prices of products stay more or less the same. <br />For example, when I bought my first coin, its value was 132 dollars. In 10 days it fell to 109. Now I can&#039;t afford some of the products I wanted. <br /><br />What to do? Buy some bitcoins now? Wait until the value&#039;s up to buy a product? Spend as fast as possible? Is there a thread, covering these and similar questions? <br /><br />I am very bad with money. And even worse with bitcoins. : )

				On SR you can buy from vendors using MoneyPaks and Western Union. etc. Search the tutorials. Don&#039;t be lazy.<br /><br />Regarding the value of the coins, the Liberty Reserve closure has put a chill in coin owners so they are selling to reduce their exposure and get cash into their pockets in case coins drop a lot and they need to hunker down for a while. I believe this is extremely good for the bitcoin market - it is behaving more rationally than I have ever seen and it is a sign it is maturing.<br /><br />I am selling as little as possible just to satisfy my cash needs and holding al my coins for the very bright future ahead. If it takes a week or a month, bitcoins are eventually going to be forced to go even higher than their highest highs and all who can and do sit on them will be richly rewarded as before.<br /><br />Modzi<br /><br />Modzi
