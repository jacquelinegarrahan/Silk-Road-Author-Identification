				Anyone have any experience with ordering from supertripps. I ordered from him almost 3 weeks ago and still haven&#039;t received anything. I feel like I might have gotten scam but have no experience with him. I hope I&#039;m wrong but would like to hear anyone else&#039;s experience.

				Keep pestering him about it and you may very well get it...some don&#039;t though.<br /><br />In future though it is advisable to order from another vendor.

				I realize that now ill give it Alittle more time bc it is still within his time frame. So ill give it a few days before I piss anyone off then I really will never get it. I was just in aww of what I found on SR the first time I logged in. If I was in my normal rational state of mind I would have done my research first. I was a kid in a candy store and if I take anything from it. I guess is talk to the community they know best.

				Just read the guys reviews, I wouldn&#039;t touch him with a 10 foot poll. I don&#039;t care how good or cheap it is, the guy has a history of ripping people off based on his reviews.

				Why is he not on the scammers list. I think they need a way to limit known scammers sales so they either stop ripping innocent buyers off or they just eventually fade into the background never to be heard from again.

				It&#039;s called selective scamming. It&#039;s easy and not very risky to scam a newb because he has no rep therefor no credibility.<br />mdma offer is huge , go for a new vendor or domestic. Start with small orders and build up your stats.

				I guess I most likely got burnt if there isn&#039;t one person who has come forward and been like no he&#039;s a good dude your shit will arrive soon. Well I guess I&#039;ll leave it up to karma now maybe I&#039;m wrong and it will be in my mailbox tomorrow but I have the feeling it will not be bc it wasn&#039;t sent. :(
