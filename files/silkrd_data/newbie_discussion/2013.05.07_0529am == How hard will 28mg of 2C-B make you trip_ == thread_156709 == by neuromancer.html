				Unfortunately dude, none of those equations matter in the case of 2cb.<br /><br />I have seen huge men that party like rock stars totally panic on just 10mg. Ive also seen, people of smaller stature that hardly do any drugs at all, have the time of their lives on 25mg. <br /><br />So, my advice to you, would be to start slow, 5-10mg. Thing about the beez, is that the difference between 15mg and 18mg can be night and day. Good luck.

				Shucks. Well, I have a couple of capsules filled with 28 mg mixed with food filler. What&#039;s a brother to do? Is there a way to effectively separate it out? Dump it out and take half and hope it&#039;s not the whole half with 28 mgs?<br /><br />I know these will be famous last words, but what&#039;s the worst that can happen, provided I&#039;m in a good setting and have a healthy mindset?

				I suppose if the food filler is of a different color than the 2c-b then separating would be somewhat possible, still not too efficient though. If I were you I would just take the full 28mg and hang on for the ride.

				The filer and the 2C-B &quot;should&quot; be evenly mixed since whoever made those caps would have made them in batches.<br /><br />Sometimes you can just pull the capsules apart.&nbsp; Other times just use a razor knife.&nbsp; Put some power into a tissue and parachute.

				Follow-up question... Is there anything that can be taken to mitigate the effects of a high dose? For example, I find eating mushrooms right after a meal usually causes the trip to take longer to set in and larger doses tend to become milder. Same effect with 2C-B?<br /><br />Will Xanax work as an abort button if things get too intense?<br /><br />I&#039;m not super worried about freaking out as I generally have a pretty comfortable with my mind and body on psychoactives -- I&#039;ve only had one negative trip with mushrooms in probably 50+ experiences over the past ~10 years, and it was instigated by ridiculously strong weed that led to some serious paranoia. I suppose it might be worth mentioning that I experimented with salvia a few times years ago and experienced some absolutely insane if short-lived rides.

				I&#039;ve taken my share of 2c-i and I&#039;ve always dissolved it in water and taken in sips. If I remember correctly, I had 250 grams in 10 caps. So, it was about 25 in each cap. I&#039;ve always had 25mg split between two people. You know, like open a cap and dissolve it in a glass of water and then each take sips from it and eye ball around half each. It takes a little time for it to dissolve in water, but if you poke at the white chunks floating in the water, it should eventually dissolve.&nbsp; That being said, I can&#039;t tell you the difference between 2c-i and 2c-b. But what I can tell you is that you won&#039;t be disappointed if you dissolve it in water. It will let you take the 2c-b at your own pace, instead of eating the whole cap.<br /><br />On a side note, the water may taste like plastic. At least that&#039;s what the 2c-i felt like. I tried to use one of those flavor packs to make my 2c-i water taste like fruit punch or mango but it didn&#039;t go too well. Kinda threw up. That was the only problem I&#039;ve faced. And dude, just be ready to trip your face off. I will drop acid anytime anywhere any day ..... but 2c-i is one experience I want to leave behind in college. The trippiest most fucked up trips ever.<br /><br /><br />Someone said that you should take the 28mg and hang on for the ride. I really wouldn&#039;t recommend that unless you have previous experience with 2c.

				The come up of the beez is minimum 30 min, so dosing slowly over time isnt a good idea. <br /><br />What you can do, is open the caps and snort tiny bumps, snorting it will begin the come up in minutes. Fair warning though, the burn of 2cb is LEGENDARY

				Yeeeaah, so you might want to disregard my previous comment. Seems like I wasn&#039;t being bad-ass enough when I took em. But considering the trips, I am kinda glad I didn&#039;t. Parachuting is definitely a good option. And like someone else said, eating anything on a full stomach will take longer to react.<br /><br />To make it clear, I wasn&#039;t saying dose over time when you have it dissolved in water. It is definitely a good idea to take the entire amount that you are wanting to take at the same time.

				Dissolving in water sounds like a pretty good idea actually...never thought of that. Maybe I dump a capsule into some water and mix it up real thoroughly before splitting the glass with my girl. Seems like the best way to ensure a relatively even dose.<br /><br />Or, shit, I&#039;ll just buy some more loose powder and use my mg scale to start small rather than worrying about freaking myself all out. Better safe than sorry with these things, eh?<br /><br />Btw, I&#039;ve always HATED snorting molly because of the burn. A few times I&#039;ve gotten a sore throat that felt like eating acid-dipped razors every time I swallowed. If 2c-b is worse...then noooo, thank you!<br /><br />Appreciate the advice guys!

There is no true psychedelic effect, i.e. ego death, with this drug from my experience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken around 45mg solo and also stacked 15mg with LSD a few times. The visuals seem to be dose dependent. They get to be very fun a lot like the ones from mescaline. <br /><br />

				Thanks for the responses. I understand it&#039;s not completely analogous, but how much MDMA does it equate to? I tend to do a few doses of 100 mgs in the course of a night. Usually no less than two and usually no more than 4-5.<br /><br />It&#039;s good that it isn&#039;t completely psychedelic. Mushrooms are pretty high commitment at higher doses and it would be nice to have a more superficial trip with an engaging body aspect, so I&#039;m looking forward to trying 2C-B.

				You do 2-5 100mg doses of what?&nbsp; 400mg+ of MDMA in a night is a lot and indicates that perhaps you are taking it too often.<br /><br />I hear a lot about 2C-B being a substitute for MDMA but the two are just very different to me.&nbsp; 2C-B amplified my senses to the point that sensation of touch and sound will almost hurt whereas with MDMA sensation feels feel.&nbsp; wikipedia says that low doses of 2C-B (eg 5mg) were once sold as ecstasy but I&#039;m guessing that dose would do nothing for you.<br /><br />Take 20mg orally and give it an hour or so.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel anything then take another 10-20mg.<br /><br />Me?&nbsp; I like taking 2C-B after MDMA (but while MDMA is still in my system).

				Yea dude, thats WAY too much MDMA for one night, shit that enough for two months really. <br /><br />Ease up on that dude, if you know whats good for you anyway.<br /><br />and the beez trip is a commitment, because you will peak for like 4 hours, on and off every 20 min or so. Thing is, it is mild enough to be able to function, for the most part. higher doses tend to make you very confused, lots of thoughts at the same time, then when you think about what youve actually been thinking so hard about, you got nothn. Its strange.

				While 28 mg is certainly not a light dose, I think you should be okay if you have some experience.<br /><br />First time I took 2c-b I took too little (I had no prior experience with psychedelics, only MDMA and weed), I had 18 mg caps and took half, and I redosed way too late.<br /><br />Second time I took too much, over 30 mg, but I had a very good time. It sure was overwhelming at moments, but 2c-b effects come in waves; one moment it&#039;s all green and red and weird, the next moment your mind is as clear and bright as it has ever been.<br /><br />Since then, I have discovered that my comfortable dose is 20 mg. I don&#039;t drink alcohol but when I go out with people who do, I love to take a 20 mg cap, and while my friends get drunk the 2c-b kicks in, and socially this works very well :-)<br /><br />That said, my very best 2c-b experience was honey flipping 20 mg 2c-b + 200 mg MDMA in a club. Incredible closed eyes visuals and the appreciation of the music through the roof! Very interesting how my comfortable social 20 mg dose turned into something mindblowing through the MDMA synergy. Highly recommended! But get familiar with it first.<br /><br />

				To be clear...the time I did 5 doses of MDMA it was super cut and was probably the equivalent of 200-300 mg of good stuff. Usually, I like around 250 mg (split in 2 doses) once every 2-3 months.<br /><br />Look forward to trying 2C-B. I think splitting the cap with my lady is the safe way to go based on Erowid experiences and what everyone is saying. Thanks y&#039;all!

				Hey<br /><br />I like 2CB a lot...and have taken it quite a few times (as well as 2CI)<br /><br />A few notes on your 28mg question<br /><br />As others have said there is a steep dose-response curve with 2Cx a little bit more will do a lot more but it varies with the person.&nbsp; Most people get a bit of excess mucus with 2CB but it isnt usually a major prob.<br /><br />I usualy take 25-30mg of 2CB and weigh 73kG (is that 160lbs ish?) I like the visuals and the &quot;eye candy&quot; psychedelia without the heavy stuff of acid/shrooms (which are also great but for different times!)<br /><br />It does come in waves as has been said so dont re-dose unless you are sure you want more!<br /><br />Dissolving in water is my favoured way it acts quicker than a cap and is almost tasteless, knock it back! <br /><br />If im feeling brave i will have 20mg in water and when im tripping nicely will snort a 10mg bump&nbsp; and BOOOOM! tripping balls for an hour BUT it HURTS LIKE FUCK in the nose :P but awesome fun!<br /><br />If you have tripped before you should be fine with 2CB it has a pretty good record though some people freak out it seems rare (never met one!)<br /><br />one of my tripping buddies snorted 25mg once (brave man!) and tripped pretty fuckin hard (in between holding his nose and saying &quot;owww&quot; a lot for 15 mins) but enjoyed it lots...was hillarious to watch we had all had it in water!<br /><br />finally if you have the opportunity try having sex on 2CB its my favourite! ;) ;) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I my eyes, its generally a weak psychedelic. Good party drug, but weak in psychedelic effects.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a handful of the 2C&#039;s (2C-C, B, P and E with E and P easily being the best).<br /><br />As a psychedelic, it just doesn&#039;t warp your mind as well as the others. Great for an MD replacement, as I hear some people and even a friend of mine gets MD style rushes and euphoria from it. I don&#039;t get these feeling unfortunately, only a mediocre stim-buzz with euphoria. No real rolling like some good Mandy. <br /><br />For a first dose though, 20mg would be a perfect amount. Maybe even 30mg if you like stimulation.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve done up to 50mg in one and then seshed it the same night bumping 5mg+/- up the nose every 10/15 minutes for a good 2 hours listening to music on my bed. Ended up doing just under 90mg. Nice head space, few visuals and a nice contentedness, but as a psychedelic, naaaa, its not for me.<br /><br />Good luck trying it though. Its a good one to first get into Phens.
