				Ok, never tried cyanescens before. They have a really unique and enjoyable smell/taste, kinda reminds me of dried porcini mushrooms. Anyway, 1 gram caught me off guard, I&#039;d say it&#039;s equivalent to a little over two grams of good cubensis. Aside from potency, I found there are some subtle differences in the trip as well. The come-up seems to be somewhat longer, about 1.5 hours vs 1hr for cubensis in my experience, and somewhat smoother and less panic-inducing, which is nice. The duration was also a bit longer for me, 3hrs vs 2hrs, from peak to end. It also seems to be more &#039;direct&#039; if that makes any sense...cleaner in a way. There are definitely some heavy emotional portions of the trip and there&#039;s some time distortion, as with cubensis, but in a way that allows you to keep a slightly better grip on reality and sanity. Being outside is intense and exhilarating, and sometimes frightening, the surroundings really come alive. As I was sliding into the trip, I was leaning against a downed tree, absorbed by the pattern cast by the light filtering through the leaves onto the trunk, when a chipmunk ran up my body and across my face. Very startling. He ran up a nearby tree and started chirping at me, which was really cool to look at, they move so fast...but I understood. I left his territory to trip elsewhere, haha. Anyway, I highly recommend these. 1 gram is a perfect calibration dose. 2 grams should be really interesting, hope to try at some point. This is a great product and a great vendor. He&#039;s got professionalism and best practices in spades, and has a really friendly and sincere presence as well. Thank you cyanspore.
