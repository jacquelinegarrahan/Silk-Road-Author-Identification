				I got this about two hours ago...<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Hello,<br /><br />I need you to resubmit your address to me using the following pgp<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.20 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFIJKuABCAC0WhtqtOKQ0XDvnxHkkqtsQsI6Xa5myJ8lYFe+/dStF1OlYaMD<br />Q67phuOg0M+CdnoSYqZaKxF86UrggYZ3Dh1HxHk1O2sE0cn+ayFzJcFx6ln5Z8Ud<br />.................<br />My computer crashed and the pgp program won&#039;t let me use my older key for some reason.&quot;<br /><br />I included only the first two lines of the PGP key.<br /><br />Hate to be paranoid but I sent the following to SR support a few min. ago...<br /><br /><br />&quot;This is the third try to send this. I&#039;ll try to be brief. I ordered from vendor DieselTherapy last Friday <br /><br />(8/9/13) order marked &quot;in transit&quot; Sat. (8/10/13). Today two hours ago, I received PM asking I resend <br /><br />address using new PGP key because &quot;the computer crashed&quot;. His page says he wouldn&#039;t mark anything &quot;in <br /><br />transit&quot; until it was in P.O.<br />Hate to be paranoid but if LE had raided and hacked acct, they may want less sophisticated (read stupid) <br /><br />to send new addresses so they can make cases off of &quot;Silkroad&quot;. I hope I&#039;m wrong, but....Sent message <br /><br />back saying I valued freedom more than what I ordered so I would wait.<br />My question is, I re-did address and copied and pasted new address with new key into reply then went to <br /><br />forums to see if there was anything there, no info on forums so I closed the window BEFORE IT WAS <br /><br />SENT. I looked at &quot;sent&quot; messages and it showed it had been sent. I deleted the message before it was <br /><br />read. Was it deleted from the server, or should I go on vacation for a while (ie will the people on the other <br /><br />end be able to read it ?)???????&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Has anyone else had same request for address from DieselTherapy with &quot;new PGP key&quot;&nbsp; and has anyone had any experience with deleting messages before read?<br /><br />I&#039;m not new but I&#039;m not big on posting in forums (not what I&#039;m here for) so I am restricted to postin here. Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />kahn

				I replied to this with my address. hoping I&#039;m not falling into the trap, seems unlikely they would hack his messages to get a few buyers, more likely he actually lost use of his pgp key and is trying to get orders out despite issues.

				Hope you&#039;re right MauryDrovich. SR support said the message I closed BEFORE I submitted it found in &quot;sent msgs&quot; was delivered. I sent another two msgs to DT (and I know these guys are busy) but no response yet. If you hear anything let us know.<br />kahn

				Let me catch my breath!!! <br /><br /><br /><br />WHEW!!!! <br /><br /><br />Kahn, it is quite normal for a vendor to ask someone to resubmit their address if there is a problem.&nbsp; I am going to go ahead and cancel your order so that you won&#039;t have to worry about any law enforcement paranoia hype malarkey.&nbsp; LOL!!! Man, you are crazy.<br />

				First, let me apologize. I was wrong and hope I have not caused this great vendor any major headaches. <br />Second, DT contacted me several days ago (after order was cancelled) and explained said he didn&#039;t have a problem with me. The mark of a great man is his willingness to see an others point of view.<br />Third, paranoia has kept me out of jail for a long, long time. Caution = Freedom.<br />I know now he had a legitimate problem w/his PGP as another, trusted, traveler on the Road contacted me and told me the story. Many thanks Juggernog. I simply hope this will not be held against me. I had a legitimate concern and since I am new and do not personally know anyone here, I went to the Forums for help. Hopefully, as time passes and I am able to communicate with more great people, I will be able to ask for advice privately and not cause a problem for a reputable vendor.<br /><br />DT, again &quot;mia culpa&quot; I publicly wanted to apologize to you. When I can get the BTC to go thru, I WILL order ASAP.<br /><br />Chagrined,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />kahn
