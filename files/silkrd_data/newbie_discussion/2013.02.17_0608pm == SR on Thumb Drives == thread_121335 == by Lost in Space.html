				Title: <strong>SR on Thumb Drives</strong><br />

				I heard someplace that just because you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean somebody&#039;s not after you. Here&#039;s a scenario (maybe an idea for a movie script): LE decides to go all out to nail the people behind SR as well as the people using it. They buy a few thousand thumb drives, take them to a special lab where they are equipped with sophisticated GPS tracking systems, then program them with everything one needs to access SR - from TOR to PGP, and offer these things for sale through SR and maybe other sites where TOR is not needed for access to all the punters out there who like to do drugs. The drives sell out like crazy and pretty soon the FBI task room has a map of the world dotted with pins everywhere one of the drives was shipped to. And these people are put under surveillance. That should lead them to a lot of the sellers on SR, but hopefully not the people running SR. Or maybe I just haven&#039;t worked out a way for them to get to those guys... maybe someone smarter than me can think of a way, and think of a way to protect ourselves from schemes like that.&nbsp;

				If you already got on SR to buy this thumb drive hopefully you would know to buy your own thumb drive to put Tor/pgp on it yourself. I don&#039;t think they would catch anyone of value to them through this.

				tor and the privacy and security it provides is great, but not perfect, as theres always some way to get caught up to.&nbsp; in the end, its up to you to be smart and ensure your own survival

				I think you&#039;re going a bit on the paranoid side here mate because just to gain access to the SR you&#039;ve got to have a modicum of understanding on privacy so what&#039;s the point of buying those USB drives anyway?&nbsp; I suppose to the uninitiated it might be inviting but then you&#039;re only going to ever get a handful of stupid users who aren&#039;t going to be that much good anyway.&nbsp; What the LEO want is big power buyers and sellers so putting together a map of small time players might be a small bust but that ain&#039;t the goal i&#039;m assuming.&nbsp; Of course when you assume you know what happens...
