				A long time ago I tried this stuff a friend had it was a liquid and you would smell it in and be really fucking high. This was back in the 90&#039;s so it might take a older person to know but anyone have any idea what it could have been? It always came in little brown vials. It was not ether, thinner, or any other store bought chemical. If I remember right it didn&#039;t even have a smell.

				Oh and thanks for the reply I was sitting here thinking of shit to ask or type about to get to 50 without just spamming. I surpised no one has them on here they were pretty fun while high. That rush feeling was like no other. The best part was the fact it only lasted a few and you where good to go. I also do not remember any real side effects.

				I was just reading though here in USA Amyl Nitrate was banned in 88 only aloud in head cleaner and other cleaning products but most mfg have taken it out or it probably has a bitter agent added like they did with duster. So I do not think that there is anything that would be in a pure clean state. but i could be wrong

				I&#039;ve tried poppers once while I was in NYC a few years ago. who knows what the actual active ingredients were, but I know poppers are still somewhat popular amongst the gay scene because it acts as a muscle relaxant of sorts. what I had was purchased at a store, so i assume it to be legal. Anyway, it was definitely fun when combined with somewhat heavy amounts of alcohol.
