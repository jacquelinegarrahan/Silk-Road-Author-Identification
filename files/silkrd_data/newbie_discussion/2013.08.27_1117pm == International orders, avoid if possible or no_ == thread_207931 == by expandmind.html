				How much increased risk is there? I really want to purchase something international for a better price (~$25 total savings). Is this worth it or not?

				If your in the US and you do your research as far as how good the vendor is with his stealth, you shouldn&#039;t have an issue. As long as your not ordering from South America, The Netherlands, ya know, a red flag country. I&#039;ve got some of the best C on the planet from Belgium, Germany and the UK has some very good stuff too. Not to knock domestic US stuff but I&#039;ve got nothing here as good as the EU stuff I&#039;ve tried, and I&#039;ve had some pretty damn good domestic product. I don&#039;t get it, we are closer to the source , but , I got aq feeling the EU product goes from source countries right over there without the Mexicans fucking it up. They go thru other countries as well, but somehow, someway there are a few vendors are getting their hands on primo product that you almost never find over here, almost. They have it on a regular basis. All letters came looking exactly like any other of the gazillion pieces of mail that travel the world every day.

				The risk of seizure is substantially higher. Domestic packages are rarely searched, but customs control in the US and especially AUS, NZ, Scandinavia are fairly tight. That&#039;s why many vendors up and won&#039;t ship to these countries. International can work, it all comes down to the strength and variety of stealth that the vendor uses. Once LE seize one package in the mail, they will be on the lookout for that particular stealth profile and single it out. Packages from certain countries are also scrutinized very closely, i.e. Netherlands, Germany, anywhere in Latin America. <br /><br />You need to do your research on vendors and the effectiveness of their stealth, and success rate in shipping from their country to yours. There should be enough information in the forums, stats, and feedback to make an informed decision. If there isn&#039;t don&#039;t risk it. You will find the success rate varies enormously, it all comes down to how creative and careful the seller is with their packaging; it is one of the main things that makes the difference between mediocre and great vendors.&nbsp; I have had many SR transactions, all but a few domestic, and the only one that didn&#039;t work out was from NL. Canada to US or vice versa is considered fairly safe and I have had several successful shipments from CA. <br />

				Meh, all of my packages have been international into the US and I&#039;ve never had an interception. Do your research and use a good vendor and you don&#039;t need to worry about a thing.

				Anything that can be packed flat and put into a normal envelope is less likely to get seized. I have made several purchases from the USA and Canada (to EU) and never had any problems. Had one package from Mexico siezed.

I will not tell how it is packed. I will say they won&#039;t open it but even if they open it they won&#039;t find the goods.

				All of my orders have been international. I&#039;ve made quite a few orders and only lost two, one to my own fault of not writing the address correctly, and the second one was an MDMA order from Mercury31 that never came, he has pretty good feedback, but some people have said he doesnt use a return address which could&#039;ve been why mine never showed. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had an issue, almost all my orders arrive quickly, (especially Germany and UK)<br /><br />I&#039;ve even ordered from the Netherlands a few times with no issues, I&#039;ve noticed NL orders take a little longer though. <br /><br /><br />Like everyone has said, take the time to research vendors and peoples experiences with them.
