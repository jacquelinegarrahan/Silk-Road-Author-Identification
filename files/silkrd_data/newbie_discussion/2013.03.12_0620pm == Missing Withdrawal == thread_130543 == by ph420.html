				Hello, I am a brand new account and relatively new to bitcoins and SR in general. Earlier today I made a couple of transactions after depositing 2btc (I had a couple previous transactions pending), I then decided to not get a certain item and proceeded to withdrawal the rest to an address i&#039;m using as a wallet, it shows on my account history page as:<br /><br />withdrawal ฿-1.72 ฿0.00 March 12, 2013, 12:08 pm UTC<br /><br />On the FAQ it says that the withdrawal should take about an hour, yet I have not received it, and blockchain.info shows no record of it. Is there a problem that I should be aware of? <br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				Sometimes there is a delay -- if they still haven&#039;t shown up in 24 hours, then let us know.&nbsp; Is it showing up on blockchain at all?
