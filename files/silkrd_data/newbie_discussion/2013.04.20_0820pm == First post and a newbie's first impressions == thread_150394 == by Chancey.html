				Hi all and its my first post here as you can see&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Well I&#039;d say I have an average amount of tech-savviness but to be honest reading through the various forum sections and threads has ultimately left me feeling quite bewildered and somewhat depressed. <br /><br />The whole process seems to be incredibly complex. I fully understand the reasons why that needs to be the case in order to protect buyers and vendors alike from LE and scammers etc but its so complex nonetheless. What with the PGP encryption thing, finding a trustworthy and value-for-money bitcoin vendor, then a drugs vendor; then the delivery arrangement process - real name v fake name, which address etc. There seems to be so much conflicting advice over all this which seems to change on an almost daily basis, plus who to trust and who&#039;s a scammer and the whole fluctuating bitcoin/vendor situation. <br /><br />All I&#039;d like to do is to be able to but some psychedelics in as safe as possible way for medicinal purposes in my case (no joke), and not recreational, without minimum fear/risk of being scammed and/or busted. I guess I just need some kind soul to take this UK based newbie under their wing, or a little sage advice at least, not that I would expect either as this is really just an opening post giving my initial impressions on the whole SR thing...other than all that it seems like a fantastic community and resource which I&#039;m delighted to have come across :D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

I have been reading through a great deal; the difficulty from what I can see is finding some kind of a consistent consensus when opinions and perceived wisdom seems to fluctuate on an almost daily basis, making the process somewhat of a challenge to say the least.

				I am glad I am not the only one! I have been reading, and reading ,, and reading , and reading , and did I mention reading?? I get the whole process in my mind but when I go to do the PGP deal I somehow screw it up! I am not computer illiterate but by no means a wiz. I think I am going cross eyed staring at screen. I read the thread pgp group that has step by step instructions, feel like a total tard! Any who u are not the only one.

				Hello from a fellow noob!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking around for a few weeks now, gradually making progress in all fronts. Just take your time, don&#039;t hurry and you&#039;ll be fine - at least I hope so.<br /><br />I&#039;ve now found a vendor I feel is worthy of my trust, I&#039;ve learned and acquired bitcoin that can&#039;t be traced back to me, I&#039;ve transferred them to my SR acco, and I&#039;ve figured out the shipping method I&#039;m gonna use. At the moment I&#039;m in the process of learning PGP, and I hope to be able to make my first purchase very soon.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind the wait, my coins are worth almost double what I paid for them now&nbsp; ;D Just have to hope they won&#039;t crash in the immediate future!<br /><br />Remember, though, to plan everything for the worst case scenario - LE busting your door with a parcel in their hands that you ordered. Or at least thats what I&#039;m preparing myself for.

E.g. I was reading one thread about trusted UK bitcoin vendors which I began diligently taking notes on and by the time I got to page 13 people were advising virtually the opposite thing to page 1 - thus about an hour&#039;s wasted time. Of course its no one&#039;s fault because either vendors sometimes start out legit to build up trust only to then rip folk off, or a popular consensus varies. All the various processes seem to be quite fluid and ever-changing too. Other threads are even longer with so many differing opinions I just end up goggle-eyed after a few hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150394.msg1036979#msg1036979">Quote from: nibbler2029 on April 20, 2013, 10:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-1-getting-started/<br /><br />This guy gives a really easy guide detailing all the steps.<br />The section on pgp is very simple to follow, just copy and paste vendors key and other bits on a website.<br />Maybe it could help you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks.
