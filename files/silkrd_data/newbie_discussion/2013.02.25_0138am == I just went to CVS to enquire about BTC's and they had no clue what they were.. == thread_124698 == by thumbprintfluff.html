				&nbsp;So I go to the local CVS store to get imfo on obtaining bitcoins and no one in the store had a freakin clue what a bitcoin is including the manager.

				Just go back and tell them you&#039;re paying a bill.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have to know it&#039;s for bitcoins, and they certainly don&#039;t have to understand what bitcoins are in order to put the payment through.

				I have to be honest with you, I told the kid what I was there for. As stated, they are not illegal. I explained to him that I also buy silver troy ounce bars. that these were lighter. And my concept is accurate. The young man was intrigued. He had no clue my true intentions that I was using walmart to traffic drugs. <br /><br />It is illegal to have weed, not smell like it.<br />

				CVS doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins as far as I know, and your experience at WalMart will be about the same. They are only payment processors; you&#039;ll need to find a separate entity that can accept their payment processing that will exchange for coins, i.e. bitinstant, bitfloor, etc...

				I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re keen on explaining what you&#039;re doing. Anyone with a basic knowledge of bitcoins knows they&#039;re mostly used for online illegal activities. Just go to Walmart (CVS asks for ID), tell them you want to send a Moneygram to pay a bill, and put in some fake information. That is unless you&#039;re looking to get busted.

				We keeping it real? Okay. Go get that shit across the street. Or take your chances here. I did bitinstant. I did my research and heard bad shit. but I wasn&#039;t a pussy and gave it a fucking shot. Roll those fucking bones man and let me know what happens after. Everything anyone posts on here if you cross-reference you will hear bad shit. You know what&#039;s fucking bad? Heroin..I want some, I do not want to go get it from some fuck. I do not want them to know me like that. If they find out that I may at some point in time may have bought that. Let them try to prove it. 2nd prove it. <br /><br />Shit or get off the fence man.<br /><br />If you do what snailgod is mentioning. make sure you put that same fake infor in you bitinstant or whatever you use. because it has to match up. Mention that shit next time snail. It is common knowledge to you and I. For someone who has not done it gets there and they fake shit they put on that insta gram is not the same as the shit they put on whatever site they use. They look like fucking clown shoes<br /><br />My first bad karma incoming probably. But we&#039;re already in dirt. May as well get dirty. That being said. I get off on the chance I can be caught as much as the drug after I have not.

				I bought my first Bitcoins a couple days ago through Bitinstant deposited into a MtGox account that took about an hour to open, and had the Bitcoins in my SR account in about two hours after using the Money Gram red telephone at Walmart.&nbsp; It was hassle and I didn&#039;t really like how MtGox asked for so much personal info to open an account but I wanted to place an SR order.&nbsp; Coinbase.com seems much easier as you can buy Bitcoins from your computer and also costs less to buy Bitcoins, so I opened an account with them.&nbsp; If Bitinstant had the option to send Bitcoins to my SR Bitcoin address I would have preferred to do it that way but I did not want to wait any longer for them to fix their website.

				You are all getting hung up on mtgox. As long as you&#039;re not making huge lump deposits for your first time or what not, they do not care. I been in the dope game a longggggg time.

Of course they don&#039;t know what bitcoins are. You have to read, read and pay attention to threads and read the manual. Real short here it is, Money gram in CVS red phone, but this is after you have an account with Mtg or Bitinstant, got it account first, then MG to zip zap to bitinstant to MtGox or if Bitinstant has there transfer up you can go to an email wallet or BTC-E. But you habve a great deal more to read and learn..You are putting the cart before the horse..

				Yes, none of these places SELL bitcoins! They are merely a place where you can pay for them and have them deposited. Then you get home and they should be there waiting for yea. YOu been at this for a few months trying to figure it out and you&#039;re stuck on getting bitcoins. <br /><br />I am not trying to put you down in anyway, however. You may want to go back your old ways. I found out what I needed to do in 4 days. It was an great deal of reading, cross-referencing and question asking. I made my first purchase here today. You have to follow the steps as are. You have to understand the software and the information for the software. You have to not read, but understand what you have read. then apply it. It sounds as if you could use someone who can actually physically be there to help you. And in forums, that is impossible. We can be there for you. Only suggest off what we have done. <br /><br />Either way, I wish you the best of luck and will be happy to answer anything else I can, that I have even the littlest of knowledge on. It is the only way to learn more about something. However, I cannot answer redundant questions because I will go kill a kitten over the frustration.

				why do sooo many people have trouble with bitinstant. If you cant figure it out there are how to shit all over the forum for 100 different ways to get coins.<br />here is my method i have used 17 times now over 6 months never a problem at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;1.gather cash equal to purchase price AND FEES of bitinstant AND zipzap.<br /><br />2. go to bitinstant.com.<br /><br />3. mark the &quot;pay from&quot; box as CVS or walmart depending on the one you go to or closest.<br /><br />4. Mark the &quot;pay to&quot; box as bitcoin address.<br /><br />5. enter your info below; such as name, phone number, bitcoin address, birth info, notify email, etc.&nbsp; Now to elaborate on this I have, on all my transactions sent my coins directly to my SR account wallet. I know some people move them around for security purposes and use fake info, i.e phone #, email, name but im cool with it cause all i am doing is sending cash money to the zipzap company in the form of a bill payment. (more on this later)<br /><br />6.fill in &quot;are you human&quot; captcha type thing and hit enter.<br /><br />7. if u entered everything right you will get a confirmation page, copy and save this info.<br /><br />8 see next post

				Zener said exactly what I said would happen using bitinstant.<br /><br />using several wallets, off and online reduces the trail. I am not switching methods. Very simple and fast for me to do. I understood a little before hand from fucking up the internet for 10 years before this. This just made me that much more scary. =)
