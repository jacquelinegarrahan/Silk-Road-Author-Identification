				Kush will come through. If you are in AU as the customs is tougher he&#039;s probably taking more pre-cautions and I don&#039;t blame him, he mentions it on his vendor page. To my knowledge and the times I ordered with him it always came through.. Matter in fact I just had one come in today. But, I&#039;m in the states...

				I don&#039;t think so. It&#039;s not there now but on his page it said it&#039;s on hold because all the packages didn&#039;t get delivered. I don&#039;t know.. He&#039;ll get to you, on his board he mentions that&#039;s he&#039;s now replying back to all...the guys probably slammed...
