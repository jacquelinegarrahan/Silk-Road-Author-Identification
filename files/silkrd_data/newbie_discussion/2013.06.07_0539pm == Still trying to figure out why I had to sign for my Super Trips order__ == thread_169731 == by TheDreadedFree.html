				Some vendors require delivery confirmation. Just because you had to sign doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a CD

				Be careful with that stuff buddy it&#039;s cut with fentanyl or a fentanyl analog such as butyramide-fentanyl or acetyl-fentanyl which are easily available on the RC market currently.

				Everyone has been reporting that SuperTrips &quot;H&quot; is only lasting an hour or so which is seriously indicative of a fentanyl based product. Start with a lot less than you would normal H to avoid a serious overdose...look around the forums he&#039;s a popular topic at the moment. <br /><br />Considering his listing is so close up the bestselling list it&#039;s hard to determine whether or not it truly is the quality we imagine / drool over. Though after reading lots on the forum I&#039;ve determined to steer clear of his material for your own personal safety.

On the very odd occasion a vendor may make a mistake with delivery instructions e.g. send with tracking when none was requested but that is very rare. The classic CD involves you being asked to sign so if you get asked a a general rule your response should be to decline as I would rather lose an order than lose my liberty.<br /><br />Seems like you got your order ok though and if it was a CD they would have come through the door a few minutes after you had taken delivery so this would seem to fall into that rare case of vendor error, personally I would be PISSED with the vendor if they did that to me.

				As an ex RC vendor I can guarantee you it was a simple mistake regarding asking to negate the necessity to provide a signature. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it being a CD.

(Maybe not my smartest move to date) House is clean and I waited a while and went to the Grocery store before opening so I was fairly sure I was not being watched.&nbsp; I also saw a comment in the product review prior do delivery saying someone else had an unexpected request for a signature.&nbsp; An experience I&#039;ll learn from no doubt.
