				Yesterday, I receive some yeyo off of SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s been three years since the last time, and I figured what the heck. so I railed about .7 yesterday.&nbsp; Last hit was at 4:45 PM.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am randomly drug test for my job, but s on average, i have been tested every 2 to 3 months.&nbsp; One month has passed since the last test, and now this morning, I receive notification for a test TODAY.<br /><br />Any tips and/or advice to help pass.&nbsp; I will be drinking a shit ton of water for the rest of the day, and prior to the lab closing I will buy a test kit from the local pharmacy to see if it shows.<br /><br />Any other input advice would be helpful.

				If you piss like a race horse, youll pass.<br /><br />Also depends on how extensive their means of testing is. For the most part, LOTS of water, more than you think you could consume. Maybe some water pills, some sort of diuretic that will induce frequent urination. You SHOULD be ok. Dont come back and hold my saying this responsible for failing, if that so happens. Best of luck.

				Hmm, you might be fucked. But also It still is really early, cocaine is still in your system and there&#039;s no detoxing in less than a day. The question however is how long does it take for it to show up in urine. I&#039;ve had a friend smoke very heavily with me one night, and take a surprise drug test administered by his parole officer in the morning and pass. Either way good luck man

				seriously mate, you need to find a clean friend to piss into a bottle for you quick time. cause you ain&#039;t passing that test today with cocaine, i don&#039;t care how much water you drink or whatever.<br /><br />protip: if you&#039;re gonna do drugs again and are under the risk of being tested then piss into a bottle before hand and keep it in the freezer.

				GOOD NEWS!!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Since all of my test for the last 4.5 years have been negative, I&#039;ve been granted a reprieve.&nbsp; I will be allowed to test tomorrow morning.&nbsp; So, if I drink a shit ton of water, which I have been doing,&nbsp; and&nbsp; I take the test tomorrow morning&nbsp; between 8 and 9 am, which is approximately 40 hours since the last hit, what are the chances that my results will be negative?

				I&#039;m stalling as much as I can, however, I must test today by 3 pm which means it would have been almost 48 hours since the last hit.&nbsp; I&#039;m drinking a shit ton of water and gatorade, taking Vitamin C supplements, and aspirin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought 6 drug tests since yesterday.&nbsp; Yesterday, they all tested positive.&nbsp; Today, I&#039;ve tested 2 and a faint line appears indicating I&#039;m showing negative.&nbsp; Ive got one last at-home test,.&nbsp; Just had a small lunch with a diet coke and going to finish the last of a quart of gatorade.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Get a flexible insulated pouch, fill with someone elses clean preheated urine. Strap it to the inside of your legs. Run a clear tube from the pouch along the bottom of your penis.<br /><br />When it is time, squeeze the pouch with your legs, out comes the clean piss. This method can work even if they are watching. Be sure it is warm, they will not trust cold piss.<br /><br />Make sure your urine donor is the same gender as you and does not do drugs.

				if i was you at the very least i would take a small vial or bottle of water with you. then use it to dilute your piss down. maybe 25 - 50%. the tests you got at home are likely to be a different brand to the ones used at your work and could be less effective. you&#039;re still taking a chance going in there just on drinking water

				Hey dude dont panic I was drug tested for a year and had no problems. Go to GNC and get Niacin. It will flush out your system, you may even turn beat red like i did, no worries its just the drug working. Coke only stays in your system for like 2 or 3 days tops. If you do drink tons of water you should be fine, however the niacin couldnt hurt either, just to be sure. I gave this exact advice weeks ago to a close friend and his test went smooth, he took the niacin and hydrated as much as possible. <br /><br />Just to give you some idea, I smoked a joint on a Friday, and got tested on a monday and due to the niacin and drinking plenty of water, the test came back negative. Also like someone else mentioned, it really depends on what kind of test it is. Those tests can be expensive so my guess is they usually go with the cheap version which probably isnt as accurate as you might think. <br /><br />Just my two cents. Good luck buddy and dont panic.

				It&#039;s almost 5 and no phone call or email yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I supply the testing center with 2 vials of urine.&nbsp; Does that mean that if I test positive that the second vial is tested to confirm the second one??? Does that usually happen the same day or the next day?&nbsp;

				Can&#039;t speak for places I don&#039;t know about but, yes sometimes they ask for 2 samples and if the field test comes back positive (if they use field tests where you are) they&#039;ll send the second off to a lab for more accurate testing. This is common in my experience. And in the same vein they didn&#039;t usually notify the tested person until the lab results came back.

				So far so good. I&#039;ve had a few scares though.&nbsp; The lady in HR who&#039;s responsible for the testing, we&#039;ll say her name is &quot;Jane&quot;.&nbsp; Well yesterday, after I got home, my phone rang and the person on the other line said, &quot;[My name], this is Jane.&quot;.........my heart dropped and skipped a beat, I thought my life was over.....then I heard the words....&quot;from the pest control company&quot;.&nbsp; Oh my god, what a relief.<br /><br />Later today, I get an email from someone else at HR, and I&#039;m not viewing the subject line as when I saw her name I got tunnel vision.&nbsp; Then when my vision came back into focus the subject line was something unrelated to the testing.<br /><br />So, if I don&#039;t post anymore, it&#039;s safe to assume, I&#039;m in the clear.
