				I see there is a section for electronics. Does Dead Pirate screen for stolen good, I&#039;d hate to see that shit<br />being put on the site, you have to draw the line there , as I think the majority of people on here are probably<br />decent people who&nbsp; just believe in the rights to do what you choose with your own body.

				They drew a line at weapons. They closed the Armory. I think that was smart and reasoned. If anything is a danger to SR, it would be a mass killing with a gun traced back to SR. Now, from a ethics standpoint... I don&#039;t know and don&#039;t care. I just want to 1) preserve my anon 2)keep SR around

Fuck that. You only have to look at the number of gun deaths per capita

				They got an armory on that black market reloaded now lol. I feel like stolen goods are ok, i mean this is like 80-90% illegal stuff on here anyway. I&#039;d like to see some shaved keys for toyotas and fords up on the listings

				Public opinion is changing for controlled substances / drugs.... it is not changing on stolen goods or unregistered weapons. SR is smart to avoid that stuff.

				Stolen goods are not screened for. How would they ever do that? You should assume that a lot of the non-drug stuff is stolen. Hell, some of the drugs could be stolen. How would we know?
