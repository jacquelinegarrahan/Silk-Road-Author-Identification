				Give me truth or Give me Death<br /><br />I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before you all is one of awful moment to this community. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or blind admiration ; and in<br />proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at<br />truth, and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to The Dread Pirate Roberts and our community. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence? If I did, I would consider myself guilty of &quot;treason&quot; towards the Silk Road community I hold dearly, and guilty of disloyalty toward the nobility that is DPR, which I revere above all political authority.<br /><br />With that said, Mr. DPR, it is natural to man to indulge in<br />the illusions of hope and freedom?. Better yet, is it right to sell those illusions to your fellow man? We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till it transforms us into anarchist drug fiends. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.<br /><br />Are we all mere junkies pretending to be revolutionaries? Is the purpose of SilkRoad really that which DPR says it is? Does it matter?<br /><br />To me, YES.<br /><br />What&#039;s your take?

				Well I have noticed that these &quot;freedom thingies&quot; work only if there is huge money involved, just look at PirateBay. So there is that.

				My point exactly Gioware.. It seems like a notion most people do not want to be open to. Questioning SilkRoad or The Pirate is almost seen as blasphemy. But that&#039;s cool, as long as we get our drugs... Right?
