				Hey SR fellas.&nbsp; I have only been able to smoke decent high mids at best from the street as to people being assholes and greed mongering bastards.&nbsp; I believe drugs are sacred and should not be disrespected and hope very much that the gods put greedy swine in their place soon.&nbsp; I have seen several legit vendors on here that looks good especially for MJ and even within the USA which is great, because I am going to try my best to avoid dealing with customs by sticking within the US.&nbsp; I just wonder the best strand for me.&nbsp; I rarely have money at the moment so I can&#039;t just throw money around.&nbsp; I need my first connect to count.&nbsp; I tend to feel kinda anxious and have random weird thoughts on weed.&nbsp; It also puts me out and sometimes I want to be energetic.&nbsp; I suffer from depression, anxiety and pain within my neck, back and head.&nbsp; I want to have a bud that relaxes muscle tension causes overall pain relief, particularly headache relief and also relaxes anxiety.&nbsp; Weed always automatically seems to relieve depression for me and make music extra enjoyable, but I&#039;d like it to relieve anxiety, particularly including the relief of social anxiety and to have no paranoid effect.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel like I tend to have a paranoid personality anyway so it usually is not too big of a problem, but sometimes a bit annoying at times.&nbsp; The main thing seems to be headaches and social anxiety.&nbsp; From my research it seems like I should look to Indica, but I don&#039;t just want something for before bed time, but something I can wake up to and be able to go out and get stuff accomplished on.&nbsp; I can&#039;t afford to buy two different strains, one daytime and one night time at the moment.&nbsp; I just wonder the&nbsp; best hybrid; I am wondering if 50/50 hybrid would be best or more sativa or more indica.&nbsp; I have read some nice reviews of Sativas that seem to have great Indica qualities and a few Indicas that seem to have enough Sativa to keep one functioning perhaps drink a coffee with it or whatnot.&nbsp; Just wondering if anyone suffers from the same medical conditions as me and what works best for them.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated and perhaps direct me to your favorite vendor for said product.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also while I want energy, I don&#039;t want to feel speedy.&nbsp; I just want to feel utterly cool, calm and collected.&nbsp; Suggestions, experiences, my fellow psychonauts?&nbsp;

				It seems that some strains affect people in different ways so it&#039;s hard to say &quot;take strain xyz for your symptoms.&quot;<br /><br />Two of the best hybrids that I&#039;ve tried recently are Girl Scout Cookies and God&#039;s Gift.<br />Both had a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; kinda of effect.&nbsp; I liked the GSC better personally because unlike God&#039;s Gift, it did not put me to sleep.<br /><br />Good luck finding the right strain for you!<br /><br /><br />
