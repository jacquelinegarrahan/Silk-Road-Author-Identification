				Question for the security and pgp experts here...<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that you placed an international order and it got held up at customs, and the vendor announced a few weeks later that they had an issue with their shippers and many packages in the last few weeks were either the incorrect items or sent to the wrong customer.<br /><br />The vendor then says that they will re-ship but you need to send your address again, and that they changed pgp keys due to getting a new computer (why they didn&#039;t export/import/backup somewhere I don&#039;t know).<br /><br />Am I being paranoid or is the pgp change just a little sketchy?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				I&#039;m newbie as well, but isn&#039;t the easiest way to just stop ordering from that vendor and wait to see what&#039;s going to happen?

				Changing PGP keys by itself wouldn&#039;t really raise flags.&nbsp; It&#039;s also possible that his (or her) computer crashed and they lost all their data, including their pgp key.&nbsp; And if that&#039;s not backed up somewhere it&#039;s (as far as anyone is aware) impossible to determine the private key from a given public key.&nbsp; Admittedly my pgp key that I use here isn&#039;t backed up but my actual pgp key is backed up in like 3 places, including off site, and printed and kept in a fire safe.&nbsp; Actually I intentionally don&#039;t back up anything related to this account.&nbsp; Fortunately I&#039;ve typed my passwords enough times I&#039;ve started to remember them.<br /><br />The rest of the story... I can&#039;t really say (my day job is with computers so I have a good understanding of that stuff). Perhaps other customers will come back and be like &quot;yeah I still trust him&quot; or &quot;stay away from him&quot; or something.

				In the real world, the key is supposed to map to the sender&#039;s name and email address used, it&#039;s one way you can validate the pgp message comes from the person sending it.&nbsp; If you want to change the name or the email address used to create the key, you can&#039;t so you need to make a new key.<br /><br />SR is slightly different because the messages are being sent from account to account, so you don&#039;t really need to validate the key to confirm identity (although I can think of some exceptions where vendors might want to validate the key against previously held keys).<br /><br />Keys can expire and in some cases they should.&nbsp; The older the key, the more chance that it&#039;s easier to crack, so periodically changing your key and upgrading the encryption makes sense.<br /><br />In this case though I&#039;d say it&#039;s because of the tormail problem the other week and the vendor has just created a new key with their new details.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />However, the account may have been captured by LE and they&#039;ve created a new key so they can nail all those unwary souls who order through them.&nbsp; Pick your option depending on your level of paranoia. ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />
