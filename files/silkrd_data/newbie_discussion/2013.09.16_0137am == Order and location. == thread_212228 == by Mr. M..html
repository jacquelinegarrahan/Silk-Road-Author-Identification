				So I&#039;m quite new here and I&#039;ve made my first purchase a day and a half ago. I really trust the avengers so I tried ordering 10 lsd tabs from Jannis and still didn&#039;t get any answers, though I think it&#039;s just the way things work here so that&#039;s not an issue.<br />The issue is that I&#039;m located in Belarus (I highly doubt anyone would care about some guy who wants some acid for himself) and since many vendors don&#039;t ship to Russia it may be the same with Belarus, which I&#039;m afraid of. If Jannis is to say &quot;no&quot; then what do I do?<br />Haizenberg and Alaska also mentioned that they don&#039;t ship to Russia, so I&#039;m getting a little hopeless here. They don&#039;t mention the reason they don&#039;t ship it there, but I still think it&#039;s some reason that would be the same concerning my location.<br /><br />Also, if there&#039;s any explanation as to why is Russia mostly off-limits to SR I&#039;d like to hear it. Just curious.<br />The one reason I&#039;d guess is that their major mail company being catastrophically retarded and incapable of delivering anything on time/safe, resulting in vendors not willing to try their luck and send anything in there.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry if my English is confusing, I&#039;m still trying to get it better. No doubt the process will never be finished.

				Oh well, makes sense.<br />I hate it when a bunch of greedy schmucks ruin great opportunities for others. Especially this time.
