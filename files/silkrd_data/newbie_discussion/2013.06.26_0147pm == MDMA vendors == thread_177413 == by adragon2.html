				Hello SRF<br /><br />Wanted to post my experience on MDMA vendors.&nbsp; So far I have bought from 4 vendors New America, Haizenberg, MeanieMart, and UnderGroundSyndicate. Ive actually bought from Haizenberg twice but since his was my 2nd Molly experience&nbsp; I wanted to have a better comparison.&nbsp; Not sure why but the domestics (NA, MM and UGS) didnt last as long as Haizenbergs.&nbsp; Mr H&#039;s molly lasted a good six hours. A group of friends and I went to the Electric Daisy Carnival I gave them some of Haizenbergs goodies and we rolled all night it was a ball.&nbsp; As far as the domestics my firts impression is NA&#039;s was the best, got a nice1gram rock that smelled just like sasafrass.&nbsp; Rolled about 4hours.&nbsp; Another big festival is comming up I gonna split up the differnt vendors among my friends and see what the feedback is.&nbsp; ill update. But me Im taking Haizenbergs.<br /><br />All of the ones above tested good (mauquis reagent)<br /><br />Oh yeah.....<br /><br />I also bought some from juergen2001 but I took his with some shrooms and had a nice evening I must say but since he wasn&#039;t listed when i was going to by more I picked up some of Haizenbergs

				Whats up guys just wanted to put my .02 btc in. DealerOfDrugs is up and coming, very friendly and responsive, and the guy knows his stuff. Wish I had more experience with MDMA vendors for this thread but I am pretty wet behind the ears and he is the only one i have dealt with.
