				For some reason they cant identify me as a person, but can force me to login to my bank account through their website to be verified. Due to this it makes me wait 4 business days for my coins to be available to use. Was anyone able to be verified so that you get your BTC instantly? Or is the whole thing a hoax?

				What you really have to wait 30 days after you&#039;ve verified your bank account? FUCK. I was hoping to order from SR within 3 days.

				I wasn&#039;t aware it was 30 days..<br />I read somewhere around here it takes around a week.<br />Could be wrong though.<br />I just verified my account but I don&#039;t want to wait that damn long.

				Same here, I can&#039;t wait a fucking month to order bitcoins. Who knows if I&#039;ll even get verified on my first try? <br /><br />The only other site people are suggesting is localbitcoins but I don&#039;t want to meet some random guy in a Walgreen&#039;s. <br />Why is this so fucking difficult I just want my goddamn drugs.

				Before I do any transfer of funds I&#039;ll ask them. Several members reported it only took five to seven days for the coins to show so they could flip them and send them here.<br /><br />I know one thing, coins are cheap as hell there right now. I don&#039;t see them withholding our funds for an entire month, not with the market on bit coins as volatile as it seems to be.

				They don&#039;t withhold your coins four a month, at level 2 verification you get them after 4 days. After 30 days from making a level 2 transaction and finishing the id verification then you can instantly buy 50 btc per day.

				Yeah, that&#039;s how I read it. You only have to wait 30 days if you want instant btc but I can wait 4 days. Not 30.
