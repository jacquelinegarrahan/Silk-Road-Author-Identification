				Hello all.<br /><br />I joined the Silk Road a month ago and love that I can finally experiment with everything I&#039;ve been curious about, plus some things that I didn&#039;t even know existed. I&#039;m wondering though, how many international letters in what period of time would it take to raise suspicion? I&#039;ve received three letters in the last month and have one more on the way. If something else catches my eye, would it probably be safe to order, or should I calm down for a bit?

				It depends on the quantities you order. If you shop online regularly on websites like ebay and so forth and receive a lot of packages internationally, I wouldn&#039;t worry about that one package so much. But if you really want to be on the safe side, I&#039;d recommend ordering from domestic sellers or ordering a few products at a time between time frames. <br /><br />Its just my opinion everything is really up to you, just make sure you stay safe and be smart when ordering. You may even order more products so its in one package from a seller as to avoid having a lot of different ones sent to you from different sellers but it all comes down to you on what you feel comfortable doing.

				Buy shit from E-Bay often. Low value items or items you actually need and even re-list some of them and resell if you wish.<br /><br />Geographical location is a major factor I&#039;d hazard as if in a large city less snooping ;)<br />
