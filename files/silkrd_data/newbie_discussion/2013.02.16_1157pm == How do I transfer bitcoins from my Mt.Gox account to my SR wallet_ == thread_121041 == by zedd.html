				The question is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; I have managed to get the money in the Mt.Gox account and have purchased my bitcoins.&nbsp; They are sitting in the Mt.Gox account and I have been trying to figure out how to send them to my SR wallet for a while with no luck.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if there is another service that does this like coinapult.&nbsp; Thanks for any help!

				This one confused me for a day or so as well! Some googling did the trick for me :) I&#039;ll run you through it though.<br /><br />Log into MtGox, then click on Funding Options on the left (under Trade and above Account History). Once there, there should be 3 options - Add Funds, Withdraw Funds and Redeem Codes -- you want Withdraw Funds. Click on that, then head on over to your Account page on Silk Road. It should have a line of text there with random letters/numbers -- copy and paste that (since it&#039;s your first time, it should tell you that it&#039;s your deposit address) into the Bitcoin Address on the MtGox/Funding Options/Withdraw Funds page, put in the amount you&#039;re transferring across and hit confirm! I pay the 0.005BTC fee, and have only done two deposits and both times selected it so I couldn&#039;t tell you the difference in time sorry. It took a couple of hours for my funds to appear in my SR account.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense! :)

				Thanks for the help!&nbsp; I have one more question.&nbsp; What about the green address and open transaction check boxes?

				Never ticked them either! and both of my transfers went through without a problem :) Someone else may be able to explain them to you though! Unfortunately, I am not that person.

				Guys you may want to &#039;tumble&#039; your coins by transferring them through a couple of instawallets before you send them to your SR wallet. https://instawallet.org<br /><br />MTGOX does not like the idea of money going from them direct to SR. <br /><br />Use a couple of wallets before you send the money to your SR wallet as that way it can&#039;t be traced. <br /><br />WRITE THE INSTAWALLET NO DOWN as if you forget it they can NOT help you get your money back. <br /><br />Instawallet is free, anonymous and requires no signup.<br /><br />The URL is the key to your wallet. If you lose it, nobody can be certain of which wallet is yours and the coins will remain unclaimed.<br /><br />Properly backup your Instawallet address or key before receiving coins.<br />Only share your bitcoin address, NOT the wallet URL or key, with the public.<br />Be aware of who may have access to your browser&#039;s history or cache.<br />Never trust shared computers such as the ones found in internet cafes.<br />Please consider yourself warned: If you lose wallet&#039;s key or URL, your Bitcoins are lost, no matter the circumstances.

				Remediless,<br /><br />Thank you for the heads up! I will keep that in mind for next time I require MtGox&#039;s services. I have found another BitCoin vendor who I will be using for any future purchases, but appreciate the warning regardless :) Thanks!

				Ok so I clicked confirm and some text came up that said withdrawing...&nbsp; however my Mt.Gox account still shows it having all the bitcoins in it.&nbsp; Should the coins have left by now if I clicked confirm about an hour ago?&nbsp; Also how long does the entire transfer over usually take?

				From memory, they should leave pretty well immediately. I take it you&#039;ve logged out of MtGox and logged back in? Check your activity log :)

				Just curious how long did it take for Mt Gox to verify your account? I&#039;m still waiting and it&#039;s been a few days.&nbsp; I&#039;m considering a different source..
