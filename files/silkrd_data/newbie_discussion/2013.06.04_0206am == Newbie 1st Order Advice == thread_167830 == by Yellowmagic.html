				Yo!&nbsp; I&#039;m a longtime lurker who, after researching numerous vendors, is on the verge of making my first purchase.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any luck however.&nbsp; The first attempt, the vendor never processed the order or gave me any communication so I canceled the order.&nbsp; The second attempt, my order was canceled by the vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the process of a third with my fingers crossed.&nbsp; I am using PGP and try to come off as legit.&nbsp; Any thoughts, or advice on how to increase the order success rate for someone with ZERO stats?<br /><br />Thanks!

				youll probably have to find a TRUSTABLE seller that will sell to you with the fact that you finalize early for them. my first few orders were that way.

				Try messaging the vendor before you order noting your newness and asking if a small order in escrow is ok. If they want FE then just say no thanks and how many orders/$ amount would they like to see to have escrow orders. I haven&#039;t had anyone turn me down yet.

				I&#039;m pretty much in your same situation. 1st order no response, so i cancelled. second, I got some weird shit that some people are questioning is legit. I finally found some reputable vendors by looking here on the forums and I also would send an introductory message. Nothing major, except that I was considering ordering from them, and would work with them to gain their trust, as they had already proven theirs with good feedback on SR and in the forums. That helped a lot.

				Cool, thanks for the info.&nbsp; Glad I&#039;m not alone.&nbsp; I will definitely try a brief introduction first.&nbsp;

				Plus it saves you from having to send your address out to a bunch of places with no benefit.&nbsp; You never know and all. I would really start with reputable vendors I&#039;m pretty new and haven&#039;t had many problems. What are you looking for ?

				robby- ive had a few good vendors in the past that required FE, and ive never been screwed over. One actually offered free priority shipping if you FE&#039;d, and it was always a good deal. but i guess you have to trust your vendor first...

				I did one FE which hopefully comes this week, it was a under $80 USD so it won&#039;t be too big a loss if it doesn&#039;t come and I will have learned my lesson. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d FE for much in the future and I would consider it a big gamble no matter the reputation of the seller.
