				I wish I could post with the big kids.<br /><br />I was just at the post office and was told that as of Saturday, those little green DCNs that we all know and love will be a thing of the past. From now on, there will be a number on the receipt instead.<br /><br />That assumes shipping via the post office window, rather than anonymous dropping through the slot or into the blue box.<br /><br />What are the other vendors doing about this?

				I don&#039;t know about this. I think there would have been more of an outcry if this was the case.&nbsp; Besides, DCN is so useful I don&#039;t think they could completely do away with the service unless people walked up to the register..

				That&#039;s what she said. Also, postage is going up. I&#039;m scrambling around trying to find answers online--will report back if I find anything.

				Here&#039;s a link:<br />http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2012/pr12_114.htm<br /><br />A quote:<br />Shipping Services<br />Several new Shipping Services products will be available in January. Free tracking will be offered to all competitive packages, including retail Priority Mail and Parcel Post (recently renamed Standard Post).<br /><br />___<br /><br />That was what she said--no little green slips anymore. Tracking will now be free with every package. BUT she said it would be a pain because people will have to keep all their receipts as that&#039;s where the number will be.<br /><br />I hope it&#039;s not true. Again, I wish someone would post on this over at the main forum. I am, naturally, very anxious.

				I was just in a local post office yesterday and the clerk gave me a whole stack of DCN&#039;s. He mentioned the postal rate going up but nothing about DCN&#039;s being discontinued and even copied a sheet showing the new rates including DCN&#039;s going to $.90 per.

				DCN is being renamed &quot;USPS Tracking&quot;, I believe, &amp; is now included for free with the new costs of all Priority &amp; Express mail. Incase any of you weren&#039;t certain, that means the green DCN slips ARE done with. <br /><br />As for HOW they plan on tracking packages, my guess would be that they use the barcode that&#039;s present on all Prioroity mail &amp; Express Mail envelopes, &amp; the number underneath it would be the tracking number. That, or they&#039;ll come out with a new slip.

				The barcode on flat rate envelopes is a UPC, and is the same on every package of one type (I&#039;m about 90% sure on this). I believe they will be printing an additional QR or bar code onto the package upon acceptance at the PO, perhaps with an ink hand stamp right at the counter. Regardless, no slips and no tracking from blue drop boxes (at least once all the old slips are out of circulation). Sorry if I&#039;m just rephrasing what you guys meant, but this is my understanding after visiting the PO recently. I personally believe a small part of the reason this change is to target people like us by making us walk into the PO (along with efficiency, competitiveness, etc.).&nbsp; I am not sure how I am going to compensate for the new tracking yet; I&#039;m open to ideas!<br /><br />Peace

				There is some new info on DCNs, credit to USAShroomzz in this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120821.msg828431#msg828431<br />in which he posted this link:<br />https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?categoryNavIds=catGetMailingShippingSupplies&amp;categoryNav=false&amp;navAction=jump&amp;navCount=0&amp;productId=P_LABEL400&amp;categoryId=catGetMailingShippingSupplies<br /><br />This is good news, however these labels are not intended for Priority mail. On the FAQ for this service, it says all Priority mail is ineligible. However, this might mean it&#039;s simply ineligible for purchasing the service because it&#039;s already included; and I&#039;m fairly certain they wouldn&#039;t reject a package for that reason. The question is whether or not it will look odd to the people handling it. I asked a clerk about them and he said he didn&#039;t have any; I would have to order them online. He also said that they were for First Class and Media Mail packages, but mentioned that you could use them on Priority if you&#039;re applying your own postage (not paying at the counter). He didn&#039;t say it convincingly enough for me to discern whether or not this will be considered &quot;normal&quot;. He didn&#039;t specify whether the DCN is still free with Priority when using this label, but I can only guess that it should be. I plan to go to another PO to ask about it soon, as the branch I visited is very small.<br /><br />This thread looks like it has some good info: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112044<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;ve since checked more post offices, they don&#039;t have label 400 at any in my town.
