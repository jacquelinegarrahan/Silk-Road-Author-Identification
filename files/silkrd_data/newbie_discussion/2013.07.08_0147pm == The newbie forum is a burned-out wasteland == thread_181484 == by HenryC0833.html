				If you&#039;ve not got the patience to publish the minimum requirement of 50 posts, you don&#039;t deserve access to the rest of the forum.<br /><br />There&#039;s 99% of spam in this forum, because a lot of the time this site attracts users who use it briefly over a few days then ditch it... many of their posts are irrelevant, abusive, full of spam and full of bullshit.<br /><br />This nonsense would spread into other arenas of SR forum, which most of the time, is full of sensible, helpful advice.<br /><br />So yeah... raise your post count or be quiet.

				Yes, yes it is... It&#039;s the burning threshold you must cross in order to enter the garden of higher discussion. <br /><br />It&#039;s also an excellent way to quarantine spammers, numbskulls, and insidious drifters to one forum instead of contaminating the entirety with the stench of pointless conversation (well, even more so than it already is).

				The characterisation you give it is too kind, if anything! The odd island of bollocks in an ocean of manure with occasional flotsam of rational thought was what sprang to my mind as I read your subject line.....drugs seem to loosen the tongue even if they can freeze the synapses....

				... or like an evil kindergarten with no teachers. <br /><br />Seriously, I didn&#039;t think about the spam thing.&nbsp; It seems to work because the grown-up forums are clean and relatively civilised.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve decided to look at it as my sacred duty, my time on the front lines fighting off spammers and scammers.&nbsp;

				Takes long enough to deal with my orders and pms on SR just don&#039;t have time to trudge 50 steps down this road to nowhere.<br /><br />Combine the &#039;schools out&#039; style quality of threads in this forum, the fact you can&#039;t post in a spam thread at the same time as someone else (there&#039;s always some greedy cunt hogging it to themselves), the fucking captcha for every post with the slowness of this site and tor in general and you end up with never reaching that 50 post mark. <br /><br />Been here a long time now and just can&#039;t be bothered doing this but hopefully one day with 1 or 2 posts every couple few months I&#039;ll get there.<br /><br />Maybe there&#039;s a 50 posts on SR forum listing on Atlantis somewhere? Maybe SR could give vendors a break and let them post in the big forum without this torture? <br /><br />Jesus, don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve got to do another captcha when i edit my post as well. Of course i&#039;m human i&#039;m editing my own post ffs!
