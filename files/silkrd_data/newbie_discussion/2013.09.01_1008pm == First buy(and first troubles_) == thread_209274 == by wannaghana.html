				Hi everyone!<br />After 1month about surfing on SR i finally could make my very first order!!! <br />I ve already had decided from days wich would have been my vendor (actually is top 1% ranked),and i just made the order (an average one) on August 28(and it results already shipped at 9pm the same day).<br />After a couple of mins i msg him to specify that&nbsp; i didnt want to sign anything at the delivery(it was my first worry),and he instant replied to dont worry,that it ll not be recorded.<br />After that i answer him again a couple of (stupid maybe) questions regarding the delivery time (it was signed as fast order 1/2 days max but not in my country so i wanted to ask him from his experience how long should i have waited for it...).<br />Since that moment... no answers anymore by him(i also sent him 2 other msgs),the order still result in transit and i have 14 days left before the autofinalizing.<br /><br />Well,<br />In his profile he also requires for auto FE,but surfing the forum i really would like to avoid this practice,at least until he answers me and explicitely ask me to FE before the delivery (he is actually top 1% vendor and i m actually a newbie,i would acconsent for sure).<br />But at least he should answer(in my first msg it was also meant that i was a newbie and i needed a lil bit support more eh eh).<br />What is your opinion people?<br />What should i do in this case(i ve already surfed enough to comprend that my next step if i dont find a way here i will contact the support)?<br />Thanks everybody for the attention and please feedback!!! <br /><br />Ps SR RRRROOOOOOCCCCKKKSSSSSS (as You all do!)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />

				Hi,<br />If he&#039;s top 1% he&#039;s probably busy so don&#039;t keep messaging them, also your broken English is tiring to read, sorry.<br />Keep it in escrow and it will be fine.<br /><br />Out of interest which vendor is it?<br />Keep us updated :)

				Eh eh sorry.. i m just realy stoned and stressed (it s been the weekend long that&nbsp; i m surfing here and my english is messing up).<br /><br />The vendor is actualyy Mr.Cronk (wich i never ever want to give a bad feedback,id just want some more contact,it s my first buy and you all see my leaks lol).<br />Since the first moment i surfed here,due to my actual location (mediterrean sea about) he seemed one of the best seller that i &quot;met&quot; .<br />After that i noticed the rank stuffs and so and then i notice that he is in the Top 1%!!! BOOM. He s mine.<br />So i just order&nbsp; 14 g of Afghan proper gold seal (i love it) because the price is also so good and the feedback also!<br />I cant see the time to get the delivery to finalize and order again,that s my pressure guys! :D<br /><br />Thanks LLama for your kind answer!<br />That was what i was going to do,but a doubt is killing me... if he requires to finalize,and i dont finalize until he ask me:<br />Will he ship my order anyway?<br />Should i just finalize or should i wait a response by him?<br />Eh eh if i m stoned now i cant see when i ll handle that stuff!<br /><br />:))) <br /><br />

				Thanks cryingie for your answer.<br />So the general suggestion is just to wait until the delivery arrives and avoid to msg him anymore?<br />In case after 17 days i dont receive anything (no response from the vendor also) i should just complain in the feedback,but due to the rank of the vendor (from wich i comprended) is almost impossible that this could happen.<br /><br />It s just that i m ansious to make this first experience and to smoke that stuff! And then order again from him for sure :D <br /><br />Cheeeeersss<br /><br />Ps if anybody is in the same situation of me or has passed on over it feel free to share with us his experience!<br />Same for Mr. Cronk wich i have the sincere hope to become his trust customer :)
