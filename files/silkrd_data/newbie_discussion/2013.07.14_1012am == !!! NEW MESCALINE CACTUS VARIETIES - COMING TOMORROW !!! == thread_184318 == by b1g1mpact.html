				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Things have been going well on the road, so to go with our top selling mescaline containing cactus, we have 2 new varieties - for a different &quot;flavour&quot; mescaline trip! They will be delivered tomorrow, so I will take some pics and add the entries then. My mesc cactus stock will be:-<br /><br />Trichocerus Peruvianus (Peruvian Torch, also known generically as San Pedro)<br />Trichocerus Pachanoi (&quot;True&quot; San Pedro)<br />Trichocerus Bridgesii (Bolivian Torch)<br /><br />We only sell the outer dried green flesh, this is the bit with the mescaline and other alkaloids, and as for our Peruvian Torch, it will be available in light, normal and heavy trip packs!<br /><br />Entries will be on my store tomorrow, watch this space!<br /><br />B1g

				Advertising your products and services is fine, but i think you should try and keep it to only creating 1 thread, in the appropriate sub-forum, instead of spamming the same thread across 4 different boards!<br /><br />Actually i think 2 threads would also be okay (one in appropriate sub-forum, and one in newbie-forum), but again, please refrain from posting across 3 different main-forums!<br /><br />If you want to get broader attention to the offer, i could also suggest finding appropriate threads, already existing, and let people know in those (your review thread, various mescaline, or cacti threads), but creating 4 identical threads across different sub-forums can quickly look like spam, which (in my opinion) looks kind of unprofessional.<br /><br />just my 2 cents...

				When you rely on SR for your main source of income, and you&#039;re new - you want as many people to see it as possible! Noobs board, as I am new vendor, rumour mill and product offers is normal - I think I placed on product requests by mistake, so I&#039;ll stick to three in future :-)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />B1g

				There&#039;s nothing wrong with spamming a bit when you are a new vendor. It doesn&#039;t look unprofessional, you just want for people to know you and your product.<br /><br />As an aid in this, b1g, you can also offer some samples to some well know reviewers in the apposite threads so that you can have some review of your product and people will know if it is good. When you have the review of a reliable person or two here on the forums people will trust you much more than normally.<br /><br />Best of luck for your marketing!
