				Thanks so much for posts like this. I was looking to buy from Super Trips as I have used his product in the past to much of my delight. Always got the 220 MG White Speakers. I have since gotten a weird vibe in regards to ST being that I read an order wasnt filled or something? That was resovled id hope..?<br /><br />Anywho,<br />&nbsp;Would you say your more happy with XTC EXPRESS? Whats the most you have gotten and I assume you had to FE?<br /><br />SS

				I ordered 5 grams from him and it never came, and now im waiting on a reship. I&#039;ve noticed that more and more people are complaining about his lost packages and quality&nbsp; :-\. His communication is great but I the more costumers he has, he becomes less professional, or maybe started scamming people? who knows.
