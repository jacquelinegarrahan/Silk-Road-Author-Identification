				&nbsp; &nbsp;All this time I spent dealing with scammers, well didn&#039;t get scammed but all the indian K suppliers ect. just seemed to fishy. Couldn&#039;t get any of them to let me do like a $40 &#039;sample&#039; order..... Because they don&#039;t want to risk blowing there cover.?. Damb politics! Guess I&#039;ll have to settle for high prices for my out of ordinary drugs. I even got to get my MXE and nbomes on here now it looks like..&nbsp; Yes im in US.&nbsp; &nbsp;All drugs should be legal.&nbsp; Then they would have about as must appeal to me as alcohol/weed/benzos which I rarely want.<br />&nbsp; What if this gets shut down? Then what? Heard of something called the farmers market. I&#039;m fine with this for now but what would I do if it got shut down?&nbsp; &nbsp;Any of you ever deal with those overseas suppliers that seem too good to be true?

				There is nothing that requires vendors to make special &quot;sample&quot; orders for people.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean they are scammers - it just means they don&#039;t do &quot;samples&quot; or smaller orders like that.<br /><br />Also, Farmers Market was shut down.

				In regards to the samples... I&#039;ve found most vendors do samples to get their rating up and then stop after they&#039;re rating is high enough. But there might be some out there that still do it.<br /><br />As for the the site getting shut down? Highly unlikely but there is another site called BlackMartket Reloaded. Never tried it. Never heard reviews. Only seen ads. Don&#039;t even have a link for you but I think I saw the ad on the deepweb directory.

				&nbsp;Thanks. And just to clear things up on the sample thing I wasn&#039;t refering to SR at all. I was talking about those vendors from Ukraine/Cameroon ect. that advertise illegals for great prices.&nbsp; &nbsp; But I don&#039;t have extra $ to take risks so even on here I&#039;m starting small.

				I apologize for being a douche, but. damn. a hell of a thing to bitch about with what we&#039;re surrounded with here. I feel safe here too. No one has a gun or a weapon. I am not in some part of a area of a city I should not be. There are things i would like off here, I will prob never ever be able to 1. afford. 2. really shouldn&#039;t do. or try even anyway. I feel privilaged just being here with you all. The entire counter culture expierence of the site for me is worth a bit coin just to be a part of. and if they said I had to pay, I would.<br /><br />I can&#039;t bitch about anything that happens to me on here. I, being an adult know that I can&#039;t get my way all the time, and know there are consequences to my actions and I am prepared for whatever. But, I have taken my lumps so I know what they feel like too.<br /><br />I am pretty stoned right now, so this might be all way off. ha.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I found several people domestically that do samples. Of a vast amount of stuff. Browse more? I am talking about 1-1.5 btc those being USD, you know the market worth I am sure. I def won&#039;t be going any where else. <br /><br />This has only been my opinion. I apologize to you if it sounded as if I were attacking, I was not. I was speaking in generalities and how I feel. Mon Anmie. =)

				I still get weed from normal dealers, I don&#039;t know why but I like to keep at least something grounded in reality. Otherwise I&#039;d miss the risk factor in it. To be honest I only buy things from SR that are completely unavailable elsewhere<br />There&#039;s also that sense of giving back to the local community, I&#039;m a big anti-corporate takeover kind of guy and SR seems just like that.<br />If my dealer starts to get funny on me he&#039;d be gone within the drop of a hat, I don&#039;t need rip-off merchants when I can get top quality shit from here cheaper.<br />IMO street dealers need to start upping their game otherwise they&#039;ll be out of business fast

				I have not had that feeling as I just began my adventure. However, I have known my dealer for a bit, and I have known many in my days. I know that no matter what they sell. It is business. I know what I am doing here is straight up business. We can be friendly and what not. But, it is business. I am going to turn my dealer into him wanting what I have. Even his green is subpar imo. I smoke every day for the past 3 years though. I think I may have missed 1 day out of all of them. I can get better quality and cheaper even. Now I do not have to deal with his kids, his fat fucking wife. and driving across town with it. <br /><br />If someone comes to my door asking me anything about what I have. they do not come in without a warrent. 2. how could they even get that warrent. My dealer is out of business. I am his main money maker. And he sells cigarettes which sell better than weed where i am at. I do not buy them, I was taking him to get them and I have not in a while so I am getting the fucker back there too. I have deals on here that I never get from him.

				I am about to become a vendor here in the next couple weeks. I will be giving out 10 samples of absolutely pure, blood-brain barrier optimized heroin at my cost (will update but should be about $20 per KNOCKOUT dose). I believe in absolute honesty in vending. I will be extracting this heroin myself (have an advanced chemistry degree) and can guarantee it&#039;s absolute purity.

That&#039;s BS in my opinion. That&#039;s a B at best. &quot;pure&quot; #4 heroin is about the same - 80 - 90%. Coke is the worst. Vendors call coke &quot;pure&quot; if it&#039;s over 60%<br /><br />Vendors and customers need to step it up. DON&#039;T fucking BUY shit that isn&#039;t claimed to be pure. And if it IS claimed to be pure, fucking buy the $5 purity test and hold the motherfuckers to their word. The world needs better drugs. Better drugs equals fewer drug related deaths and fewer bad experiences. <br /><br />Anyway, if anyone is a heroin connoisseur and wants to try my stuff, my username on SR is funeightyone. keep checking back for my listings. They&#039;ll be coming up soon. Just DON&#039;T FUCKING OVERDOSE ON MY SHIT!!!!! 10mg at MOST the first go-around!!!!! don&#039;t be an ass and ruin it for everyone else. If I find out someone died because I provided some truly pure heroin out of the goodness of my heart, I&#039;ll never be able to live with myself.

If that is the case, I will most definitely be willing to try a sample. Just to put your mind at ease -- I am not &quot;new&quot; to heroin. I am new to a higher purity, though. I am also new to SR (hence the mention of a deposit).<br /><br />One question. What do you mean when you say &quot;blood-brain barrier optimized heroin&quot;? FYI - I know about the blood-brain barrier. If you could just be a little more specific that would be nice. I&#039;m just curious is all.

Can&#039;t even give free samples away yet. But p cyanescens is not well known outside the Pacific Northwest, so until I get some samples out and get some feedback, people just don&#039;t know how much better those shrooms are. I guess even with wikipedia<br /><br />I&#039;m not even sure it would do much better here even if i could afford the 25BTC. I know the only person on SR who has them also has 50 other drugs, so there&#039;s no telling how small a part that is. People recognize psilocybe cubensis because those can be grown indoors so there is waaaay more of those than the better wild ones you have to go out and hunt<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s just tough starting out. Until i can prove it, nobody knows. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll pick up once i get some reviews, and then maybe I can gather enough BTC to come here but for the time being, I&#039;m stuck in the beginners pergatory, even tho I have decades of hunting experience myself<br /><br />there&#039;s just no other way around it
