				forum REALLY grinding my gears with this whole &quot;doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;ve clean buyer stats, have made any thoughtful posts ever, have been a member for nearly a year - over a year&quot;... <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;because....<br />&nbsp;I have a fucking solution to a question I would have been able to answer prior to this badly executed situation regarding pins, i.e. rigs, noodles, needles, syringes, etc. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;So.... for the benefit of just us &quot;noobs&quot; (oh, when....when...when...will i finally be 1337?!!):<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;In some places, it is a real hassle to purchase these fuqers... you&#039;ll have to leave your piercings at home, pull your hair in a ponytail, cover up those tracks and that ink and get the local pharmacist to believe that you are on vacation and your dog is diabetic and MUST have his insulin (Vetsulin, Humulin N) twice a day or he will die and the nasty TSA took your syringes at the airport...may you please please buy a bag - no you don&#039;t have the meds with you, they are back at the room in the mini-fridge. If she/he buys it, $6 later you walk out with 10 or 12 rigs. Research the size of your &quot;dog&quot; and the needle size you need - Americans, no they are not sold by the inch ;) . Hit up all your local pharmacies in the morning, then another day late in the day and so on....<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;OR...<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Use the interwebz peeps... everything you read on it is TRUE (omg,rly,lol) and it&#039;s not just for pr0n and drugs. i SWEAR. ( . )( . )<br /><br />Be safe, look it up, look it up again, READ, think, then do it if it feels right - after that... have a lovely fuq of an evening. Wewt.<br /><br />--andblue<br /><br />P.S.) Any mod who has a moment... perhaps post some portion of this in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2484.msg781854#msg781854<br />or hell, in some circles... this shit is tech support...
