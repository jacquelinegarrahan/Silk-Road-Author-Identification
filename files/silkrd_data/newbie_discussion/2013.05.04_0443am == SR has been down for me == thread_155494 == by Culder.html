				I have been able to access SR for the last 1 hour plus+. If you are having issues getting to the main page just restart your computer, and make sure it&#039;s not the same IP address as before. I have had the best luck with IP addresses starting with 60-85, anything 90-230 gives me a connection timeout, error, or unable to connect. Thanks DPR for your hard work, and your patience of such situation. DPR is a master mind!!! He thinks about these situations before they occur unlike other people &amp; websites, and the results always show him having the upper hand at the end. Everyone needs to remember that no matter what BM site you do business with there will always be issues. It&#039;s a matter of time, popularity, greed, ransoms, gov, competition, and those who have the mind set of ruining others creations due to there suffers. Be open minded and think positive. If anyone thinks this is such an issue you should delete your account. Those other websites have no customers, and once they do guess what will happen....DOS attack!!!!, and they probably won&#039;t be able to counteract the attack. Best wishes to SR, and those who sail the ship!!! ARRRHHHH

				God knows how many of these topics have been started this week. If I had just ONE bitcoin....<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />(Yes it&#039;s still down, been trying on and off today and tonight.)

				best bet is probably patience.&nbsp; whoever is doing it (if it&#039;s an individual with a botnet or a small group like competitors) will eventually run out of patience or resources to keep it up

As it is always the case with my adorable luck, these things always happens when I need the service the most (if it had happened the same last week I would not have mind that much).<br /><br />Oh well... I suppose it will start to work everything fine when I will need it anymore (damn) ;-)

				I am a vendor and i have been having a LOT of trouble getting online, so much so that i was unable to process a recent order in a timely fashion and had to cancel and refund it. It&#039;s especially irritating because once the remaining standing orders are finalised I am at 29 total orders processed. That one I had to cancel means I don&#039;t know when or if I&#039;m gonna get that last one so I can get my bond back. I opened my account in february and at that time bitcoins were worth $14 a piece. Now they are at 108. At one point they were at 250. I think you can imagine what a pricktease that is. <br /><br />Doubling the misery is that without sales or my bond back I cannot invest in more inventory either. 2 weeks of food is all the money I have now, 5 weeks time I will be in arrears on rent. Luckily I have a backup plan that will go into action on tuesday, finding work or clients to teach english. Not being able to speak the local language well has mostly been a unpleasand and stressful difficulty with being in a foreign country but my english is very good and in demand in a pretty big way here so I think I&#039;ll be ok even if SR ends up being down either for a long time or permanently.
