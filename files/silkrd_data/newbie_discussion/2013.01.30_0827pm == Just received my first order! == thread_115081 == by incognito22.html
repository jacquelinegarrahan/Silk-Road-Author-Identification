I was so excited when I received my first test order. It may take you a few tries to find the right vendor. It took me 7 test orders from 7 different vendors to find a few vendors I can work with. My favorite weed vendors so far are Norcal420HookUp, HeartOfHumboldt, and DarkExpresso. I recommend all 3 of them highly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m waiting on HOH to message me back about shipping and then I&#039;m ordering some Bluberry Kush today.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait.
