				Hey man, <br /><br />first you have to get to 50 post before you can post in other sections, but yeah there is a section for buyers/sellers<br />and general silk road stuff but no matter..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the vender you are talking about however, if he has good feed back and a lot of transactions some say more than 300<br />then you know that really can&#039;t be faked.<br /><br />My advice for you however, is START SMALL, just spend a bit coin or less on your first few buys, no buyer is going to trust you much at the<br />moment as you havent built up a sellers rep.<br /><br />What do I mean, so everytime you buy, you leave feedback but that info is also listed for buyers! so if you have had disputes in the past or whatever this may look bad.<br /><br />As your are just starting up this will also look bad for the seller as you could just scam straight away, say you never got the stuff but you did, ruin their good feedback etc....<br /><br />What they may ask you to do is FE, FE stands for Finalize early, this means that you have waved your Escrow rights (read up on what this is) This potentially a risky thing to do, BUT not if you are buying small and off a seller with lots of good rep and good numbers?<br /><br />They will not rip you off on a small deal for a two reasons, one is that when you become a vender it costs you 6.5 BTC so why would you risk losing that for a one time scam?<br /><br />Second they dont want to lose the rep.<br /><br />SOOOO to sum up, buy if the vender has good numbers (lots of past sales) and good feedback, and buy small...<br /><br />The last thing is obvs you will need to have a form of contact to speak to the vender pass on address etc, for this it is very advisable to use a PGP (pritty good privacy) you may of heard this already I don&#039;t know, if not do your research on it, look up a youtube video for how to use it...<br /><br />Sorry if this is another NUKE for your head, but hey, its pretty fun stuff to learn<br /><br />Welcome to the Road !

				PGP club! search that, they have a tutorial, it&#039;s a must. <br /><br />Don&#039;t stress dude, just be patient, careful and read.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard good things about farmer1 (quality, shipping etc), he&#039;s the only vendor i can see in my favorites that sells smaller stuff - it&#039;s not really my thing.&nbsp;

				If you are really stuck with the pgp you can send me PM message on here, I have just had to learn it all so fresh in the mind, yeah don&#039;t be too nervous, this is safer than the street in terms of being caught by police, but its more easy to lose your money, like ciaobingo said, just keep reading, knoweldge is eveything on SR<br /><br />peace

				Maybe consider buying books, if any interest you, they are cheap and can help you get up that purchase count<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how safe it is considering you download something so there are risks with that but I saw it suggested once and it seemed worth looking into.
