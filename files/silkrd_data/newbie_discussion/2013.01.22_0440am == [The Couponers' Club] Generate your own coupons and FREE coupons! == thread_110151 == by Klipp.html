				Hey everyone! I&#039;ve been waiting to write this post for MONTHS!<br /><br />I saw how much PurpleLotus was helping people, and I wanted to join in the fun. I asked PL what I could do to help, and he said the community could really use a coupon generator program. I took that idea, and ran with it. After several months of working, I&#039;m finally ready to release my baby.<br /><br />Without further ado, I present to you, The Couponers&#039; Club (http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/).<br /><br />The Couponers&#039; Club offers FREE custom-made coupons every Friday, made by the Coupon Generator, which is the main attraction at The Couponers&#039; Club.<br /><br />Using the generator, you can create a coupon to fit your needs. I&#039;ve made a tutorial for creating the coupons, which you can find here: http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/how-to-make-a-coupon<br /><br />You can play around with the generator here: http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/generator<br /><br />From there, you can preview your coupon. After you get credits, you will be able to finalize those coupons, which will give you a full-scale 300dpi printable coupon.<br /><br />The cost of credits are as follows:<br /><br />For $100, you get 10+1 FREE credits : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c53eea9000<br />For $50, you get 5 credits : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ab5d833197<br />For the skeptics, you can buy a single credit at the premium price of $20 : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c3cb5afde6<br /><br />If you run across any bugs, please contact my by sending me a PM here or on SR (where my username is Klipp as well). Leave feedback here, any questions, comments or suggestions.<br /><br />Enjoy the savings!<br /><br />&nbsp;- Klipp<br /><br />p.s. As this generator represents a significant investment of my time, I ask that those who would like to support the continued development and show appreciation to donate to: 1KLiPPunLr4dTJyjypH2ozGb7JGnz5dP.<br /><br />I love you all, and I look forward to continuing to enhance the generator to make all of our lives easier!

				No worries, Mammoth. Everything look okay now?<br /><br />I also want to say that while this is an external onion site, ALL transactions happen on SR. We will not use any other service to accept payments, for the security of our customers.

				DrChong, you can use the generated coupons (and the freebie coupons) at almost any retail store (walmart, target, kmart, etc.) in the USA only. If possible, I might enhance the generator to allow for other countries, but for now these coupons will only work in the US.

				I have just enhanced the generator based on some feedback I&#039;ve received. Watermark images are now more visible, as they were previously too light to be printed by many. I have also made the watermark image repeat if it did not fill a sizable portion of the watermark area. Let me know your thoughts, and please keep the comments and suggestions rolling in!<br /><br />Also, PurpleLotus has created a new freebie coupon for Laughing Cow Cheese, which you can find on the front page of The Couponers&#039; Club, or within &#039;My Coupons&#039; if you already have an account.<br /><br />One of the beta testers for the generator and a respected vendor on SR by his own rights, 420blindman, has posted in the main thread, and I will repost his review of the generator here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fellow Silk Roadies,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on the Road sine last March and have both purchased and sold items. The Coupon Generator is by far the best item I&#039;ve come across, and easiest to use. I&#039;ve been playing with it the last couple of days, and wanted to tell my story. After making 6 coupons in under one hour, I headed out to my local Walmart. Found the items I had coupons for, went to the self checkout with cash, and passed all of the coupons with out a single problem. While still at Walmart, I did some recon for future coupons to make for the next trip. Then, back to the fort to generate some more. Same thing, made another 6 coupons, only this time they only took a 1/2 hour to make, as the program is so simple. Next stop, Target, found the items, did my recon, and had to go to the cashier, as the self checkout was closed. Same results, everything scanned without a question. I&#039;ve since generated coupons for Whole Foods and other local grocers, without having a single problem.<br /><br />To me, this is a game changer, and will be for anyone who purchases it. And with the support you receive from Purple Lotus, I really don&#039;t see why this wouldn&#039;t be the very next purchase you make. What ever money you were saving or using for anything else, can easily be tripled or quadrupled by using the Coupon Generator. For $100, you can make enough coupons to save $1000 in a week or two. On my latest trip today, I spent $29 at Walmart and walked away with just over $250 in merchandise. I went thru self checkout 3 times, and once to the cashier. No bubbles, no troubles...was grinning the entire time.<br /><br />Thank you Purple Lotus, for your genius idea and vision, and Klipp for making it a reality and simple to use.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, or would like further details from my ventures, please feel free to PM or ask here.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Can&#039;t wait for Klipp to hit his 50 posts, in which case I will have to take over this thread also. Since once you hit 50 posts, my man, you won&#039;t be able to post in this thread ever again, but as a vendor I always can come and newb chat.

I&#039;m going to set aside some time and jump in some other newbie threads, I suppose.<br />

				Here are some more testimonials from other threads:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: shrektastic</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">passed my first 2 coupons today from the generator....It&#039;s such a liberating feeling knowing that I can provide for my family with the exact items I need whether it be household items or filling the refrigerator with things that I want us to eat.Yes the other collections are fantastic and Lord knows I use the shit out of those things as well,But Buying this C.G listing will pan out to be the SMARTEST thing/item I&#039;ve ever purchased in my LIFE besides my firearms.<br />Lotus.....thank you for the thousandth time,I know you have had your fill of nut-hugging people who say shit to get free stuff from you,Not that I don&#039;t understand why they do it...You&#039;re such a giving and considerate dude and I&#039;m glad I have the pleasure of knowin ya for more reasons than I can think of.<br />If people DON&#039;T buy that from you....it leads a further belief that I have been fighting that Americans are NOT getting any smarter.Off of 2 coupons at 4 stores in a 1 hr run today mixed in with the OC...I paid for the entire 10 pack that i bought a few days ago.I&#039;m no economics major...but I think I just &quot;Found a winner&quot; and will be investing in THIS.....FUCK the stock market and greedy corporations....I&#039;m taking my portion back thanks to you.<br />PEACE you awesome little bastard. :) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: handsoap</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just finished my first one, looks awesome. Took me all of 10 minutes (got into the details too much)<br />Will report back after use but knowing the man behind the purple plan there should be no problem.<br />I don&#039;t see how anyone reading this is still thinking about it but I&#039;ll preach to the quire anyhow: Wanna save money? GET THIS<br />This listing like any other by PL pays for itself every damn trip<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you&#039;ve not bought credits yet, you&#039;re missing out on a LOT of savings. PL&#039;s coupons were the very first thing I bought off of SR 6 months ago, and it&#039;s been the only purchase that has actually brought IN money, rather than losing more of it.<br /><br />Link in the sig if you want to design and print your own coupons.
