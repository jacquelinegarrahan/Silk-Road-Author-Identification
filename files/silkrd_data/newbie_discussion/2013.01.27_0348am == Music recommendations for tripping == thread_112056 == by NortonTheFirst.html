				What&#039;s everyone&#039;s favorite music for tripping? The other night I listened to the Akira soundtrack while I was on acid. It was unfathomably strange and beautiful, especially the second-to-last track &quot;Illusion&quot;. Highly recommended, but you have to have a good sound system to really appreciate it!

				Depends on my mood. If I&#039;m really trying to have a deep experience and learn from it, I tend to play something like Onerepublic or Coldplay to relax myself and get in the right mindset. If I&#039;m doing something like the 2C&#039;s and just want to be fucked up, I&#039;ll listen to dance music and dubstep.

				haha YES!&nbsp; I did a search for tripping music specifically to see if anyone else appreciates TOOL as much as I do.<br />Listening to Lateralus in full while on acid is on my bucket list.&nbsp; Anyone tried it?

				Can&#039;t believe this wasn&#039;t the first response... Pink Floyd! <br />The most amazing music for tripping or being stoned. Anything from the albums Meddle, Wish You Were Here, The Wall... actually any of them.<br />Listened to Deep Purple the last time I was taking shrooms in Amsterdam also and that really worked well. Child in Time was awesome.

				the classics:<br />pink floyd<br />grateful dead, live stuff from 69, or the early to mid 70&#039;s stuff.<br /><br />Simon Posford/shpongle/hallucinogen<br />hallucinogen in dub sounds good on lsd. so weird and trippy<br /><br />miles davis<br />tool<br />radiohead<br /><br />or really, just put on whatever youre feeling at the moment. if it sounds good and moves you in a sober mood, its going to sound so much better while tripping.

				Yesterday my roommate and I tripped on LSD for the first time. It was incredible. We listened to a variety of things, such as Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Jamiroquai, Bob Marley, The Mars Volta, Jimi Hendrix, and more. Some songs I would recommend would be these:<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve Been Loving You - Led Zeppelin - Live at Madison Square Garden (song remains the same)<br />Dazed and Confused - Led Zeppelin<br />Star Spangled Banner - Jimi Hendrix - Live at Woodstock (AMAZING!)<br />Cosmic Girl - Jamiroquai (really groovy, funky music to dance to)<br /><br />and to top it off, take a hot shower with Aqueous Transmission by Incubus playing. It is so peaceful and relaxing.<br /><br />I actually wrote up a trip report, it is kind of long but to anyone who wants to read it, enjoy! Let me know what you think.<br /><br /><br />Previously to yesterday, I have never taken a hallucinogen except for Salvia a few years ago. Salvia was interesting but I never wanted to do it again. Anyway, my roommate and I took 2 of LucyDrops tabs each, both first timers, at 2pm yesterday. We started to feel something at around 2:45-3pm, just light sensations, as we delve deeper into the rabbit hole, into &quot;Wonderland.&quot; I first noticed a shadow of one of my large speakers floating &amp; rotating, like on a cloud. We were both VERY positive and full of excitement. We decided to play Mario Kart Double Dash on Gamecube as we were approaching the peak, and it was so much fun. My roommate won 1st place in every single game, and we were so engaged to the colorful levels. Following the Mario Kart fun, we observed the giant mirror in our living room and made friends with our reflective counterparts. It was amazing!<br /><br />At around 4:30pm, we took a 30minute walk outside, around the busy city streets. Life was incredibly magnificent and beautiful, I felt so insignificant and significant at the same time. The sun was setting and the colors were so vivid and lush. I was drawn towards the sun, it was so lovely. We started walking back home after a certain point, and just kept taking in the raw beauty of everything, man made &amp; nature together. I felt like I was standing still on a moving walkway, just floating around everywhere.<br /><br />Afterwards, we decided to play Guitar Hero, which was an AWESOME idea. My roommate is insane on the drums, both in the game and in real life (we&#039;ll get to that part soon), while I played guitar. We started off with Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden and I was immediately 100% engaged in the game, dancing and rocking out on another level. We played a few more songs and ended with Uprising by Muse, which I equally got sucked into. After we were done rocking out, we went upstairs and played real music. My roommate got on his drum kit and I cracked my guitar amp and we just JAMMED for 30 minutes. Our groove was so experimental, funky, and just, groovy. I poured so much heart and soul into my guitar playing.<br /><br />We then went downstairs to eat some stuff we bought earlier from the grocery store. Raspberries, mango slices, strawberry ice pops, and more. We put on some music, turned on our 42&quot; HDTV visualizer, fired up the DJ lights, turned on the blacklights, and finally turned off the lights. Throughout our trip, we listened to so much stuff. Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Netsky, JIMI HENDRIX, Bob Marley, Jamiroquai, and much more. Jamiroquai made me dance for 30 minutes straight, and I mean DANCE. So funky. As for Jimi Hendrix, I have to say his music took me to another world. I felt the raw soul and feeling of his playing, voice, and from the rest of his band. I HIGHLY recommend listening to his version of the Star Spangled Banner live at Woodstock. Jimi was making sounds that BLEW my mind, and to think he was doing that in the 1960s..<br /><br />My roommate had some realizations about his beliefs in God, which he shared with me. We also agreed that this experience, LSD, was like being a little kid again. We found so much excitement and fun throughout the whole experience. Also, I should note that we tried smoking weed about 5-6hrs into the trip. It boosted the experience and was great. I also tried smoking some Damiana, which make me even more positive and happy. At some point, we decided to each take a hot shower, in our own showers, with our own music on. It was the best shower I&#039;ve ever taken to say the least. The water felt wonderful, and the music I picked was perfect. The first song, which was the majority of the shower, was Aqueous Transmissions by Incubus. Literally the best shower song while tripping, in my opinion. Go look it up on youtube, it is highly peaceful. At the end of the song, there are sounds of frogs croaking for a good minute, which was very lovely and peaceful.<br />After the shower we gave each other some alone time, with my roommate browsing his computer and becoming introspective, while I put on a movie in my room. The movie of choice? Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Result? I could not stop laughing, everything was hilarious.<br /><br />Following the movie, we listened to some more music downstairs, and I decided to eat a meal. I heated up some Panang Curry &amp; rice w/ Orange Juice as a drink, and it was delicious. I smoked some more weed around 1am, and was able to peacefully fall asleep. I woke up 6hrs later feeling great.<br /><br />I could say a million other things, but this is my general trip report, for a first timer. LucyDrop is an amazing vendor. I ordered 10 tabs on Friday, and received them Tuesday. My roommate and I both have 3 tabs left each, for another trip down the rabbit hole, in the not so distant future.

				TRAP(subgenre of dubstep) Will blow your mind best while rolling in my opinion. Flosstradamus, UZ, OG Status, Crunkin, Dj Dlux are a few to get you started!

				I, like others have already said before me, love anything by Tool when I&#039;m tripping. Their melodies weave patterns through my brain (*worst description of the experience ever*) and it&#039;s truly awe-inspiring. <br />My friend showed me this site *clearnet warning*: https://www.stereodose.com/<br />It&#039;s supposed to create you a playlist depending on what drug you&#039;re taking and the mood you&#039;re in, but I haven&#039;t tried it properly yet. Maybe someone on here will like it :)<br />- JH

				I&#039;d say it ought to depend on what kind of music you like the most!<br /><br />The best playlist I ever made for an acid trip included Animal Collective, The Beatles, some math rock (Hella, Tera Melos, Bygones) and Brahms&#039; 4th Symphony.<br />Definitely try classical music. It&#039;s enchanting!<br /><br />If I were to trip to any music now (last time I tripped was a while ago), I might include some so-called &quot;chillwave&quot; and funky electronic music, like Flying Lotus, Blackbird Blackbird, Micachu, Toro y Moi, Baths, etc.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the artist Animal Collective, however, if I could recommend any one thing.

				Mainly D&#039;n&#039;B and Dubstep.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago i was on 25i and had taken quite a lot which put me in a state. my mates say i was on a couch rolling around with my eyes closed for hours!! All i remember is that i had my laptop on&nbsp; shuffling my dubstep. I could here every single sound like they where coming from different places in the room. I had closed eye visuals that i can only relate to fireworks that went in time to the music. Each sound in the song would come from a different direction and have its own visual firework. It was quite amazing!!

				It&#039;s been said more than once, but it definitely stands out from the crowd...<br /><br />Shpongle - DMT<br /><br />For a wild visual trip look for the Flash video that has that song playing with trippy visuals search &quot;Danny Gomez - Flashback&quot;.<br /><br />

				Already mentioned is Hallucinogen, I particularly like The Lone Deranger (a friend of mine played guitar on it!). Less well known is a compilation album by Return to the Source (RTTS) called &#039;Chakra Journey&#039; - CD2 is brilliantly psychedelic with a fantastic progression based on the different chakras, great sounds; whales, dolphins, sexual moans, amongst others. Totally amazing!<br /><br />Something else I&#039;m a big fan of is classical music; Beethoven&#039;s piano sonatas are beautiful. His symphonies are all amazing, though can be quite overwhelming. I also love JS Bach&#039;s string pieces (I forget all their names) and nothing is as amazing as Toccata &amp; Fugue! It sounds like someone who, having only ever played a pub piano, suddenly finds themselves in front of a massive organ [snigger] and just lets rip!<br /><br />But let&#039;s face it, very little music is actually bad when tripping, except maybe stuff that&#039;s too angry or pop music - can&#039;t stand pop music....
