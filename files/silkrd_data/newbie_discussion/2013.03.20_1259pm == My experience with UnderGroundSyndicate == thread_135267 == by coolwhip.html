				Posting here because it&#039;s the only place I can post things (Mods please move this to the Rumor Mill), as well as the listing was deleted so my feedback no longer shows up. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to other users to not have a heads up.<br /><br />So I ordered something from this dude UnderGroundSyndicate, figured hey 99 rep, he must be doing something right.<br /><br />I was extremely displeased with the quality of the package. There was no attempt to make it discreet. The package had something labeled &quot;Research&quot; on the top, which ordinarily wouldn&#039;t be an issue except it arouses more suspicion if there already was some. I&#039;m not overly worried about this, I was more worried at the lack of smell proofing the package. A dog could smell this a 1/4 mile away upwind... If you&#039;re in a situation where discreetness is a must, he is not your guy.<br /><br />That being said, what lacked in the shipping was made up for in the quality. VERY pleased with the huge shard and plenty of medium sized ones I received. Good quality stuff right here. Weight was spot on.<br /><br />tl;dr Buy for quality, not for discreetness.

				Thanks for this feedback. I&#039;m a new user and I probably won&#039;t buy from them, though I was considering. Lack of discretion in packaging is a deal breaker for me. I&#039;m disturbed by the list of &quot;banned clients&quot; on their seller page. WTF is that all about? This seller hostility is so annoying. I can understand that they might have problems getting scammed, but publishing ban lists? Really???

				I received the mid-grade weed from UGS. No problems. Well packaged--no &quot;research&quot; label. It may be their way of &quot;mixing it up&quot; so there isn&#039;t a pattern for LE to recognize...<br /><br />EDIT: &quot;Ban Lists&quot; is an excellent way to protect vendors from getting raped with bad feedback. There&#039;s enough LE and scams on SR already. It&#039;s a way to police the police and scammers simultaneously. I condone such behavior. It&#039;s a step toward (hopefully) openness and fairness in the marketplace.

				Ban Lists could also include people that have released sensitive information (about shipping/product packaging, etc) that would otherwise jeopardize Vendors....

				Give suitable feedback on the order and then when you hit 50 you can say more in the forums if you want. I&#039;m sure the constructive criticism would be welcome regarding the packaging

				I&#039;ve read through some of these posts regarding UGS (UnderGroundSyndicate) and I don&#039;t know how there could be so many negative comments. In my experience, every transaction done with this seller has been irreproachable. The quality of the product is ALWAYS beyond excellent. I have never experienced these packaging issues that people are reporting--nothing but discrete, well done shipping on UGS&#039; part. In fact, my experiences with this seller have built absolute loyalty to them on my part--if given the option, I wouldn&#039;t even consider ordering through anyone else. <br /><br />Anyone complaining about ban lists is simply ignorant of the way the SR works--vendors have to have their security and assurances as much as buyers do and when there is a buyer out there ripping people off, endangering sellers or the community, or otherwise not following the rules (which should be pretty straightforward to anyone who can read and has half-a-brain), need to get bitch-slapped. Sure, the vendor could just blacklist the buyer--but that would not alert the SR community to a possible danger and someone else could get ripped off etc. <br /><br />What has been established here is an economy--and simply because it operates on the underground of the market, it doesn&#039;t mean that the same principles of economics are any different than in any other market. Operating in an anonymous environment requires additional methods and layers of trust to be built, and that&#039;s just the way it is if the market is to be protected. The only people who should be complaining about ban lists are the people who want to rip off sellers. If you aren&#039;t guilty, then why worry about it?<br /><br />UGS is, in my opinion, top-notch, and anyone who is worried about doing business with them because of the posts in this forum--DON&#039;T WORRY. UGS is fast, reliable, and, in the rare event that something did go wrong with your order, happy to make the situation right. People who don&#039;t get what they expect and rush to give a poor rating/review aren&#039;t following the proper channels--there is nothing wrong with contacting the seller if you think they did something wrong and, in my experience, most of them will be more than happy correct any errors made (which are usually just human mistakes, we all make them). <br /><br />I&#039;ve dealt with a number of sellers on the SR, and UGS is without a doubt, a professional, reliable seller. Anyone who says differently hasn&#039;t got a clue what they&#039;re talking about.

				I was a regular and happy UnderGroundSyndicate customer until this last order two days ago. It was heavily cut with baking soda.&nbsp; When I contacted them about it, all I got was in your face attitude.<br /><br />Their stuff was great, the packaging was great and shipping was quick. I&#039;m really sad to see this happen.
