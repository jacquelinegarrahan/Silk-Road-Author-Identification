				Hi.&nbsp; I did something very stupid &amp; am very worried.&nbsp; I used to order from a site, cleanstar24.pl about 6 years ago.&nbsp; I placed an order with them last week &amp; just discovered the previous owner is now in jail in the US for 20 years as of 2011.&nbsp; The site is still operational.&nbsp; The receipt I received say the payment was made to the guy that is now in jail, and (out of my own stupidity) the payment can probably be traced back to me.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m possibly screwed(my own fault, I admit).&nbsp; I know somebody on the internet knows if anybody has successfully ordered from this site in the past 2 years, and all of my research reveals no useful information.&nbsp; Does anybody have the slightest idea of a place online I can ask this question to?&nbsp; Some tor forum somewhere or something where this information may be found?&nbsp; Thank anybody for any possible advice at all.

				But why would the site still be up and functional?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t look like it did 6 years ago &amp; the domain was transferred to another host in 2012.
