				So basically, yeah, I go on SR, mmmmmmm tasty tasty drugs! And weed &quot;er-whur&quot;. This I like. But sometimes I wander over to the electronics and other sections and I see really cool, completely legal shit that I want and can&#039;t usually find IRL.<br />Would it in ANY way be considered illegal to order something of SR that was itself legal?<br /><br />The only reason I&#039;m wondering is because the law likes to fuck people that are even near drugs/etc.<br />IE If you&#039;re a minor, at a restaurant with even YOUR PARENT, who is enjoying a beer, and they go to the restroom, you can legally be given an MIP for the beer being on the table w/ you. Seen it happen.

				I&#039;m no expert on this topic by any means (and a noob like yourself trying to build posts) but I would say anything connected to SR is considered illegal. Not technically speaking if you buy a totally legit PS3 say on SR, I really don&#039;t see what&#039;s illegal about that, but I&#039;m sure the feds want more than anything to shut it down due to the simple fact that you can purchase illegal items there, but again just my opinion.

				look at it lie this - when considering legality, think about specific charges- if you were to purchase a legal item, what specifically would the charges be? and what would the chances of successful prosecution be? BTC are not illegal (except i guess in Thailand now) using TOR is not illegal- logging onto SR is not illegal - so i would guess purchasing a legal product would not be illegal- just m opinion

				I was startled by my first sight of the front page, all those drugs! I had a vision of a marketplace like a virtual Moroccan bazar,&nbsp; of good deals on everything exotic, including illegal items. <br />Nevertheless I made the effort to get here for something so I don&#039;t know why I was suprised. All those pretty pictures of products like any slick catalog.<br />

				That is exactly my thinking, like yeah you might be Harry fucking Potter but your ass was still in Diagon Alley, that&#039;s some shady shit.<br />What I WAS thinking was that buying some neeto legal stuff off SR at the same time as drugs would at least obscure shit should the law ever get suspicious.<br />Loling at this scenario thats playing in my head<br />LEO: &quot;Okay we have reason to believe this person is recieving drugs in the mail. LOOK! a package for them! grab it, it&#039;s probably drugs!&quot;<br />LEO opens box<br />&quot;Huh, nothing but manthongs/polos/RAM/HDD/usbdrive/fakerolex/NIGHTVISION*/FLIR*&quot;<br />I am at home, wondering where my shit is but not that concerned because I&#039;m baked as fuck cause me weed got there fine<br /><br />*yeah, nightvision and FLIR in the electronics section. COOL AS FUCK. like you can get it off amazon or wherever, but still, cool shit, take a look at electronics if youve never been in that section.<br /><br />verdant: your logic seems flawless to me, and it SHOULD be like that, no doubt.

				Certainly if this were a regular website like ebay, ebay would get in tons of legal trouble for facilitating the sale of illegal goods and services.<br /><br />However, if a vendor came on here and sold 100% legal goods/services, I don&#039;t suppose they could get into any trouble.<br /><br />
