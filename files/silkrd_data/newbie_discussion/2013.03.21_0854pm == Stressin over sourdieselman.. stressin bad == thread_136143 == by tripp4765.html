				If he didn&#039;t ship it, what&#039;s the problem?&nbsp; You did stay in escrow, right?

				he seemed pretty reputable even if he shut down I doubt he plans on ripping his last customers off unless you bought like 10lbs and finalized early I wouldnt sweat it&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is the reason why the silk road is designed the way it is. You should ALWAYS stay in escrow. And use pgp. This keeps your info safe and you money in a trusted location. If it does not arrive so be it.... but your money is safe.

				Also on another note, i order from SDM Monday just a day before all this and he had great communication and delivered my package on time very professionally and completely in escrow. So that&#039;s a notch in his favor.

All i can hope for is that he shipped it on wednesday. I also hope that nothing horrible happened -- its plausible that a partner of his got fucked - i just hope it wasn&#039;t the partner that was in charge of sending out the orders - otherwise, all of our drops/safety could be in jeopardy. I&#039;ll try not to freak out until saturday. I&#039;m really hoping that it comes tomorrow.

				shmiddy,<br /><br />Yes that is correct. If he marked it in transit then your odds are good. Mine was also marked in transit quickly.&nbsp; Again you did stay in escrow.

				Are any of you concerned about a major seizure of SDM&#039;s shipments? The more i think about that the more unlikely it seems to me.

				Why would a vender just close down and say that he&#039;s &#039;gone forever&#039;? That&#039;s stupid and pisses off his customers, especially the ones who are waiting for product. <br />I don&#039;t get it.
