				Was suggested by two people who have sampled it :) to make a topic here in the newbie discussion forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This stuff was great, boshed the whole 20mg as I have a hefty benzo tolerance and this stuff had me drowsy and feeling good within an hour and lasted a long time although i fell asleep after 4 hours. I don&#039;t get on with etizolam as well so I&#039;m definitely gonna be experimenting a lot more with this bad boy in the future. Seller seems like a nice guy as well</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Offered to save me some in case he ran out as I wasn&#039;t sure I was ready to order but I decided to order anyway. Next day domestic. No scales so hard to gauge by eye but think I had about 15mg (but who knows). An hour an a half later subtle effects are obvious - I&#039;ve been taking 6-8 zepose along with 2mg of etizolam for a while, that&#039;s just in the evenings too, so tolerance is evident. Will dose again in a little while but I&#039;m thinking it seems really nice so far, despite taking supposedly up to four hours to kick in - much like phenazepam.<br /><br />I do think this may be very similar to phenaz but without the xanax-esque mental zombification, which is a relief because I&#039;ve done stupid things on xanax. Cheers, will most likely order more in hte very near future. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Brilliant product, super fast delivery and dispatch, excellent discreet packaging (for domestic), and very friendly and helpful communication!<br /><br />Bouncetobass is a very honest and generous vendor, Silk Road needs more vendors like him. I would highly recommend him!<br /><br />Many thanks for the free sample, and I look forward to dealing with you in the future!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Selling here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a60a6366b2&nbsp; &nbsp;250mg of Flubromazepam (Benzo) Powder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£29.95<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/58444d74ef&nbsp; &nbsp;500mg of Flubromazepam (Benzo) Powder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£54.95<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7b2f2bf218&nbsp; &nbsp;100mg of Flubromazepam (Benzo) Powder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£12.45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This topic is for any talk of Flubromazepam, but like I said it was suggested to make a topic here as others can only post here :)
