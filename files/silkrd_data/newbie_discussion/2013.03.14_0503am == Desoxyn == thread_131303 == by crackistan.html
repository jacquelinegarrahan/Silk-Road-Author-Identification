				Title: <strong>Desoxyn</strong><br />

				Any interest in these? I have lots of these and cannot take them, elevates my blood pressure too much. I have no idea how much to sell them for though. Obviously I will not sell them anywhere other than the site, don&#039;t ask. <br /><br />So I am thinking of starting with five packs and a couple of either 10mg diazepam or 1mg alpalozam and a couple of 0.1mg clonidine, but not sure of the price point. <br /><br />Each desoxyn contains 5mg of N-MethylAmphetamine. Made in the USA by Ovation Pharma. Each is stamped OV on one side and 12 on the other.<br /><br />For anybody wanting to research or read about this go here http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=21828<br /><br />If you use a lot of meth, particularly if you are an IV user then this is not for you. If you like adderall, vyvanse, or dexedrine then you will most likely try desoxyn and never look back. I wish I could still take it, but such is life.<br /><br />I had two friends help me organize my garage before winter and gave them each five desoxyn which they both ate right away. One who snots his meth and takes tons of adderall, vyvanse etc was so smoked he was mostly useless in the project because he was so spun he didn&#039;t help in my garage at all. Instead he proceeded to take all kinds of shit out of his car and put it all over my driveway. Probably bundled up some of my tools when he finally packed his shit up. Fucking tweakers.<br /><br />My other friend who came took his five and proceeded to mope around and smoke cigarettes and drink beer doing little work and complaining the whole time that he didn&#039;t feel anything. Either he had been up for several days shooting his meth or was acting to get more desoxyn. Most likely the former as he only asked once for more of them and didn&#039;t push hard. He knew I had several hundred of them.<br /><br />My opinion is that one of these is about like 10mg of adderall, but two of them was like taking a 30mg IR. They come on very very fast. I would take two as soon as my alarm went off at 0415 and hit snooze. Ten minutes later when the alarm went off again I would be up and in the shower. It was great. Fuck, I am late to work all the time now, but not worth it to me long term.<br /><br />I have crushed and snorted a lot of these. Crushed smooth they are actually very easy on the nose. I would usually snort one pill, half in each nostril. They do result in a lot of powder, but they work very very well.<br /><br />So, what would you sell them for?

				I am. I am just waiting until I can flow the deposit to SR, my finances are all planned for the next couple of weeks. In the meantime I am researching the process.<br /><br />I plan on giving away clonidine with all orders as blood pressure is no joke. I will toss in diazepam or alpralozam at the buyers choice until I have my rep built.<br /><br />I just need to figure a price point.
