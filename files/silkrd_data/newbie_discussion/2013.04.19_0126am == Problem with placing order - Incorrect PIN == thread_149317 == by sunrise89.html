				This is extremely frustrating.<br /><br />I tried to place my first order and I am 100% certain I entered the correct PIN to complete my order but it kept telling me I had entered an incorrect PIN. <br /><br />I copied and pasted the PIN from a text doc with all my log in details that I made when registering on SR so it is impossible for it to be incorrect.<br /><br />I tried a few more times, typing the PIN manually and copy and pasting from the text doc but still no luck. I then tried another PIN which I used when updating my settings for security reason and this also failed.<br /><br />My PIN has now been locked for 72 hours which means I am unable to make any orders.<br /><br />Are there any known issues with the PIN/ordering system at the moment?<br /><br />Please could anyone give me some advice on how to resolve this issue and progress with placing my first order?<br /><br />I really don&#039;t want to wait another 2/3 days for for my PIN to reset only to find I have the same problem again!<br />

				If it does happen again, I think the best thing to do would be to contact SR Support. Other than that, there is not really much to be done.

What do you think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It depends how much of a rep your current account has. My buyers account has over 15 transactions with flawless stats, starting over with a new one would take a real catastrophe. But if you are just starting, you don&#039;t lose much by starting over. I would give Support a chance first. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149317.msg1030352#msg1030352">Quote from: tfag22 on April 19, 2013, 02:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">my account logged itself out and now i cant log in i created a new account to contact sr support. perhaps these could be related?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My first thought would be to ask if you got phished. If the URL is not &quot;silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&quot; and/or it asks for your PIN on login, then you&#039;ve been phished. Since you were apparently able to create another account to contact Support, I would guess that it is not a technical glitch. Have you tried to log in to your original account since contacting Support?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149317.msg1030390#msg1030390">Quote from: sunrise89 on April 19, 2013, 02:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does SR charge a fee to send Bitcoins from one user account to another?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not as far as I know, but I have no experience with this myself.

				Thanks Maple. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have any rep on this account yet as I&#039;m new here and haven&#039;t made my first order yet :)<br /><br />Hope support gets back to me and can fix the problem.<br /><br />Anyone else had this problem before?

SR Support has a ton of shit to deal with and it would likely be much quicker that way.

I&#039;m afraid you will just have to wait the 72 hours and then reset it. I&#039;m almost positive there is no way around that. You would need your PIN in order to make any transfers.
