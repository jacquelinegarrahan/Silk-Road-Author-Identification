				Topic says most of it.. The menu with categories++ Is much smaller than it should be.. It is only a few drugs, everything else is gone.. How could something like this happen? I saw it yesterday but was sure it was a little bug, but when i logged in again now, it still the same.. only 29 drugs and no books, no appareals, no nothing.. I<br /><br />Its a big problem since i cant find anything and i am afraid it may be a &quot;counterfit-page&quot;<br /><br />Anybody notice the same? Or have aaany idea on how this can happen? <br /><br />Thanks! Appreciate your help!

				Another thing is that all the pictures on the frontpage are gone, and when i search on different kinds of drugs it just shows a plain text list.. (Before it was pictures at the right of some product is one example) Could it be a &quot;counterfit-page&quot; ?

				Its a good idea to have a &quot;toss-away&quot; account with nothing on it. If you&#039;re ever feeling uncomfortable just log in with it first.<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />btw.

				If your connection to the site is extremely poor, or the server is extremely stressed, the connection can close without your web browser noticing (it&#039;s not quite so simple, but that&#039;s the basic idea).&nbsp; That means it would stop loading the page midway, which would cause what you&#039;re seeing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;re trying to go to your accounts page by the URL?&nbsp; Just click on your balance displayed on the home page.&nbsp; You sound like you&#039;re trolling.&nbsp; Why not give the whole URL you&#039;re looking at, etc.
