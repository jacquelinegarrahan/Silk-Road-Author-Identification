				Punctuation marks are symbols that indicate the structure and organization of written language, as well as intonation and pauses to be observed when reading aloud.<br /><br />In written English, punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences. For example, &quot;woman, without her man, is nothing&quot; (emphasizing the importance of men) and &quot;woman: without her, man is nothing&quot; (emphasizing the importance of women) have greatly different meanings, as do &quot;eats shoots and leaves&quot; (to mean &quot;consumes plant growths&quot;) and &quot;eats, shoots and leaves&quot; (to mean &quot;eats firstly, fires a weapon secondly, and leaves the scene thirdly&quot;).[1]<br /><br />The rules of punctuation vary with language, location, register and time and are constantly evolving. Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the author&#039;s (or editor&#039;s) choice. Tachygraphic language forms, such as those used in online chat and text messages, may have wildly different rules. For English usage, see the articles on specific punctuation marks.

				What are we doing on this site??? We&#039;re making drug deals!!! Whether it&#039;s the Road or the local corner, these deals are always iffy and it aint over ti.ll the drugs are in your hands. It&#039;s up to YOU to protect yourself, thru never agreeing to FE , and, to do your proper research on which vendor you decide to use. Even with all that, nothing is guaranteed with drugs, all you can do is lower your chances of getting fucked.

				i&#039;m starting to feel like it&#039;ll be safer doing a deal on the street of Baltimore where they filmed that TV Show &quot;The Wire&quot; than buying here<br /><br />like someone said in another fuck thread, we shouldn&#039;t be surprised when we get screw by someone selling illegal drugs anonymously on the internet
