				This is for all the people who have doubted or complained about the vendor Indubitably. I believe he is a stand up guy and have nothing but a good experience with him. every time I PM&#039;ed him he got right back to me. Then I had ordered a sample and he returned my money so I pm&#039;ed him and asked for the sample that I ordered and he said sorry for the problem and it came in a couple of days. So as far as him beating people that is a fallacy.

				I can back this statement. I ordered a sample of MDMA from him LITERALLY just before it stopped being free. It came within 2 business days of being posted in transit, and was almost 300mgs from what I could tell. Split it with my roommate and we both rolled VERY nicely from it. If his Molly is as good as his Brown, that is up to par as well! Communication: 5/5, Shipping: 5/5, Product: 5/5 = Overall: 10/5! This guy is destined to be a SR vendor worthy of being an example of professionalism and customer satisfaction-oriented service for all other vendors to learn from!<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor

				Just FYI, there have been differences in the quality of the samples and the quality of the 1/2 and full G&#039;s of H. I can attest to that personally. I&#039;m not sure about the MDMA.

				I ordered MDMA from him and got some crap that was fake. From all the good reviews he was still getting, 5/5, 4/5, I thought it was just a slip up and tried again. I&#039;m still waiting for my order for 11 days now. This guy is full of shit and a scammer. Buy at your own risk, you have been warned.

I can assure you that not ALL vendors are hit or miss, in fact, there&#039;s probably a really huge percentage that are on point in every aspect of almost every transaction they make. I don&#039;t know what kind of drugs you are into, but if you name some of them, I can list some VERY reputable vendors. If I can&#039;t someone on the forums will. One of the keys to not getting fucked over is to do research on the forums. I know the OP can make posts in the big boy forums(now he can at least,) but even if you can&#039;t NEWBIES CAN USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION IN ANY THREAD, NEWB OR NOT. So just do your research here. Its too easy for dishonest vendors to fake feedback on the main site. You need to come here and here recommendations from reputable forum members. Most of them are willing to point newbies in the right direction, provided you use the search function first. Even if you don&#039;t a lot of them(myself included) will help you out. Most people, or at least people like me, hate to see others get scammed by lowlife assholes.<br /><br />As far as indubitably goes, I&#039;ve already had 2 experiences with him. I think he&#039;s either 1) SOME kind of weird scam artist who sent decent samples and then cut the shit out of his big orders, 2) In over his head and really got another unlucky break by getting a bunk second batch of H, or 3) Just a big ass dopehead who thought selling on SR would work for him, but then ended up doing too much of his own supply, forcing him to cut the shit out of his bigger orders. Either way, I&#039;d say don&#039;t listen to the OP, be weary of indubitably.

				I just want to throw my hat into the ring and say that Indub got me my mdma promptly and of good quality.&nbsp; I placed my order late thursday and would like it to have shipped friday.&nbsp; It shipped monday, which still isn&#039;t bad considering the shitstorm he&#039;s been dealing with re the bunk H.&nbsp; I understand a lot of people are pissed about the H and I hope he sets it right with them.&nbsp; Of course, after you miss your daily dose, there really is no setting it right, is there? I&#039;ve been there. I am guessing that indub got screwed on a batch and it takes a while to trace down the SOB who fucked everyone.&nbsp; I hope this works out well for all the decent people involved.<br />Peace,<br />halleo

				I was another customer sorely disappointed by the H. Still giving him the benefit of doubt as a legit vendor but man am I glad I limited my order to just a couple points

				Do not order any MDMA! from him or just maybe his samples! I ordered a sample from indubitably and I received bunk pure white powder that stuck to everything and have no clue what it was.<br /><br />I questioned him about the quaLITY and he never gave a response nor a refund!
