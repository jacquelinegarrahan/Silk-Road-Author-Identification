				Pretty straightforward. My only issue is they recommend the Hanewin JavaScript app to encrypt your address. So you&#039;re outsourcing your security to that site and trusting that it doesn&#039;t steal your address. They wouldn&#039;t be able to link your address to a specific purchase, but I&#039;m not comfortable (potentially) adding my address to some database they could be collecting.<br />

It looks as though it&#039;s all purely JavaScript and no packets get sent to the server (confirmed with Wireshark), so if you have used it you can probably sleep without worrying about anyone having logged your messages.<br /><br />So, in order to answer your question more directly:<br />Yes, by using that page you are ensuring only the person(s) with the private key that corresponds to the public key will be able to decrypt your message. And the only risk it poses is that the owner of the site could decide to make his JavaScript application log everything you&#039;re encrypting, for whatever reason (cooperation with feds, blackmail etc). I doubt that will ever happen, and to be honest you probably run about the same risk of having the OpenGPG source code compromised without anyone noticing; in which case things could also go very bad. In short: I&#039;d be OK with using the service Hanewin provides at the moment.

				Trusting the site to do PGP is indeed a bad idea. I&#039;m glad others have checked with wireshark that nothing goes over the wire. But what if they change the site one day? What if LE compels them to, after seeing that they&#039;re used by new SR people a lot? It&#039;s a bad idea.<br /><br />Learn to use PGP properly, and stay safe folks.

For all you know, the source code for OpenGPG could have been compromised (would be far from the first time that happened to an open source project) leaving some serious back doors open. This would be far more serious than the potential logging of your address, they could even log the exact products you&#039;re ordering. Even more likely to happen is that you download the binary from some mirror server, and this mirror has been compromised and the binary modified (this is why you should always check that the hashes match up) to do nasty things.<br /><br />In the end, you&#039;re always trusting a third party unless you&#039;re writing the software yourself or encrypting the message by hand (which would take forever). :-\

I&#039;m glad others have checked with wireshark that nothing goes over the wire. But what if they change the site one day? What if LE compels them to, after seeing that they&#039;re used by new SR people a lot? It&#039;s a bad idea.<br /><br />Learn to use PGP properly, and stay safe folks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Indeed, this is a risk you run. And to be honest I think we should have our own customized version of OpenGPG (or better yet, written from scratch) to ensure nothing bad goes on. If we kept it really light on features, there would be no need to ever update or change it and once enough people have looked over the code it could be verified and kept as the final version. This, in combination with hash checks to make sure the code is unmodified would be the most reliable thing I can think of because you could spread the hash all over the web. If the feds or hackers compromised this server they could change the hash on this site, but they&#039;d have to hack the entire internet to change all the hashes around (or at least the majority of them). Should there EVER be an update, the only one who could issue it would be DPR and he would have to sign it using his public key.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in this I&#039;m up for writing this software, it would be in either C or C++. I would need plenty people to scrutinize the code though, because otherwise everyone would have to trust me and that could be a disaster (I buy drugs off the internet, after all!). So if you have a lot of experience with C/C++, and would like to help out, please let me know. If you come up with any good reason why this is a terrible idea, please also let me know.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I forgot to add that the source would obviously have to be scrutinized again before the DPR signed version becomes final, in case his private key or he himself gets compromised. And the software would obviously be open source so anyone can look it over and ask questions that need to be asked to ensure everyone&#039;s safety.<br />

But I do think we should get our own version at some point, and it could also be made a lot easier than it is right now for the simple needs of our community.

				What are your thoughts on terabithias h? I only bought 1 stamp and express delivered it, so i don&#039;t expect it to be a priority with all the other orders she has to process. Just wanna know if you&#039;ve tried it and if it&#039;s good. You seem to be knowledgable of the good vendors on silk road which is why i am asking you directly. Thanks man. Btw. Bought it early friday morning, so hope it goes into transit today(fingers-crossed).
