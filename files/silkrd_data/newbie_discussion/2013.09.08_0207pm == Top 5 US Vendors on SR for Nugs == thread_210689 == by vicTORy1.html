				New on the forum but have been following for a few months. In your opinions who are the best SR weed vendors? Rated on stealth, product, service and transit times. ONLY US sellers I&#039;m interested, no offense to our fine gents out of the country but with recent cracks down I rather not run the risk. Thanks to all who take the time to reply, cheers!

				You would need to specify whether you were shopping for personal-use amounts or bulk-resell amounts, as there would be a different list of five for each with little or no overlap.

				I would like to read peoples&#039; opinions/experiences w/ vendors who are selling personal amounts 1/4 to 1/2 oz. of indoor medical grade cannabis-<br />ive read that some sell outdoor as indoor, and some are selling cannabis dispensary rejects - so any thoughts would be appreciated

				I can&#039;t really speak to a top 5, as I haven&#039;t ordered from everyone.&nbsp; Some of my favorites so far though, for quality vs. price, are TheDreamatorium, Buttonwood and LawnMowerMan.&nbsp; All delivered very quickly, with excellent packaging and stealth and the product was oustanding for the price.

				I guess we can break it down a little bit like this:<br /><br />Who has the best connoisseur type incredible bud? You pay a little bit more for it, but the dankness is worth it.<br /><br />Who has great prices on bulk??<br /><br />Who sells good wax or BHO???<br /><br />Who are the best vendors in your opinion/experience?<br /><br />Are sellers on here consistent for the most part? What&#039;s the best bud you&#039;ve gotten from the road? What the best experience you&#039;ve had getting bud on the road?

				New to the forum and busy trying to understand PGP I forgot I started this thread and love the feedback from everyone and agree I should of been more specific on the criteria I was after. My primary purchase will be for personal use only. Looking for GSC, OG kush, Headband, Sour Diesel, Jack Herer basically the stuff I can&#039;t get on the right coast or at least in my local.
