				Hey everybody I just wanna say hiiiii, I&#039;m new to all of this. I never order drugs online, only bought in person. But I plan to very soon once I learn how!!!!<br /><br />This place has got good reputation for being legit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read over the documents regarding PGP and Bitcoin, and I have still a bit confusion. I&#039;ve got the privacy settings set on my computer and everything. <br /><br />My questions,<br /><br />Where do I find a PGP encrypter? Do I just google it or is it a specific type?<br /><br />Where can I purchase bitcoins, and how do I work this bitcoin wallet? <br /><br />Can I pay someone in cash in person rather than online is that possible for a currency exchange? <br /><br />Anyone do online conversions in here? <br /><br />If my order gets seized does that mean I&#039;m fucked?<br /><br />Thanks Guys!!!!! <br /><br />~Lemon<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hi there!<br />If you&#039;re on windows download gpg4usb (easiest to use) or gp4win. There&#039;s a tutorial on the gpg4usb on its website and there&#039;s a really good tutorial for gp4win on here. <br />First of all, look at the stickied threads in the security sub-forum, it has all the necessary information (and a link to the gpg4win tutorial).<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the US, check out bitfloor.com, it&#039;s the easiest way and cheapest way to get some in the US, don&#039;t access bitfloor through TOR though and try to access it with an anonymous computer (a friend&#039;s or the library or something that isn&#039;t linked to you). <br />All you need to do is create an account on bitfloor, make a &quot;cash deposit&quot;, print the thingy, go to a bank of america, and ask for an &quot;out of state deposit slip&quot; unless you&#039;re in New York I think. You&#039;ll have dollars in the next hour on your account. Then do a &quot;limit order&quot; (slower but better rates, you basically sell them to the price you want, but obviously a too low price won&#039;t work) or &quot;market order&quot;, which is instantaneous. <br /><br />Then withdraw the bitcoins to your SR wallet (again, on an anonymous computer, it&#039;s better for you), and you have your coins!! Going through a seller always puts you at the risk of getting scammed and you have crappy rates and they take a huge fee..<br /><br />If you&#039;re not in the US, look at localbitcoins.com, it gives you bitcoin sellers near your area (use the buy cash option). Except you actually meet those sellers and they withdraw the coins right in front of you, it&#039;s cheaper and the risk of getting scammed isn&#039;t there compared to vendors on SR. This method also works for the US but bitfloor is way better..
