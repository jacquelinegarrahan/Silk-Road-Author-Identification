				You need to read the buying guide. This is not a suggestion. Go to this page: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page <br />and familiarize yourself with the process.<br />

I didnt realise this applies to when a vendors products are no longer listed.<br /><br />and thanks will check the thread.

				Ya, just cancel it after the 4 day mark. And contact the seller, because he might try to throw it in transit as soon as he sees the order.

				The vendor has 4 days to mark the item &quot;in transit&quot;. The vendor can also &quot;cancel&quot; the order during those 4 days. The buyer can cancel after 4 days as long as the seller has not marked the item &quot;in transit&quot; which means &quot;shipped&quot;. <br />So, if the item is not marked &quot;in transit&quot; after 4 days then you can cancel the order. The seller has good feedback and reputation, chances are high that he ran out of product after your order was placed. <br />Good luck

				Yeah i guessed running out may have been the cause just seems strange to have run out of C and H at the exact same time. time will tell i suppose. Im not going to email the seller to cancel it if they get it in the post between now and me canceling it then fingers crossed it will still turn up in time.<br />Thanks for replys

				I woudn&#039;t worry at all <br />I have used C63AMG quite some times and he always deliver, usually quite fast.<br /><br />and I would be very sad to see him disappear as he delivers excellent blow.<br /><br />
