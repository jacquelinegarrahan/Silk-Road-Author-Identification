				Been here for a couple of months. These are the vendors i&#039;ve tried.<br /><br />Lloydbrothers - coke - good quality and quick delivery.<br />Ivory - mdma - was really nice mandy.<br />cfd247 - mdma - wouldn&#039;t buy again unless i knew it was a different batch. Didn&#039;t have the nice mandy feel i wanted.<br />foxbelle77 - mdma - haven&#039;t tried it yet, but was cheap, super fast, and it tastes and smells great.<br />Pattern - lsd - got a shiva. Had it NYE mixed with some MDMA. Made for a funny night. Good comms and super stealth packaging. Best i&#039;ve seen so far<br />4Sale - lsd - really quick delivery. Haven&#039;t tried yet, but have read good things.<br />Magic Moments - coke - really nice coke, best i&#039;ve had in a while. Good comms and delivery was quick.<br /><br />Hope this helps somoene

				UndergroundSyndicate (Red ? MDMA pills by Supertrips) Shipped with the Quickness. Product was straight fire!<br />CloudSurfer (MDMA Powder) Stealh was by far the best I&#039;ve ever seen. Product gave a clean mellow high<br />Dutchaanbod (MDMA) decent stealth, butthe best bang for your buck regarding to MDMA. Product was amazing but the duration was short<br />TheILF (MDA) Ships Quick, Great Stealth, Product is retard good plus they really go the extra mile for their customers<br />Xander (MDMA) Cheapest Domestic MDMA, Stealth needed a little work, Shipped Quick, Product was Energetic.<br />Emonkey (2cb) Decent Stealh, can&#039;t really compare any other vendor&#039;s 2cb but 3 of his pills had me in cartoon land<br />4Sale ( MDMA) Decent Stealh, Product was decent<br /><br />Hope this helps

				TweetB - Bubble hash - amazing shit, little bit expensive but very professional, uber fast shipping<br />Farmer1 - Skush - bomb ass indica, fastest shipping of all time<br />Anonymart - Alaskan Thunder Fuck - decent bud, decent shipping speed, pro stealth, probably going to try another strain from him at some point<br />Bamann - Ak-47 - decent bud, pro stealth, epic batman sticker included with order, now proudly displayed on one of my bongs.<br /><br />Ive also got a nightmare situation going on with KushCartel, like many others. Ordered an oz of &quot;White Fire OG&quot; with express mail on 1/16 and it was only shipped yesterday. Total price at the time including the express mail cost was 16.91 BTC, which was around $220 and has now risen to almost $300. The entire point of ordering from him was the $200 price, so a bit of a disappointment there. Could&#039;ve just waited a week and ordered yesterday and it only would&#039;ve been about 12 BTC or so. So hopefully this dreadful business will be concluded this afternoon according to the tracking info he gave me. Never ordering from that guy again. Just so absolutely incompetent to the point that it starts to seem suspicious. I&#039;m also waiting on a quarter of Sour from TheEmeraldTriangle which might arrive today as well, will update on that.<br /><br />In the future I plan to order mostly wax once I get my oil rig. But for now, nugs.

				I am wondering - and no disrespect intended - how many posters are posting about things they have heard rather than things they have actually bought, received and documented in terms of medicinal effect.<br /><br />Just sayin&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m new and I have a wife who has just been diagnosed with Stage IV lung and liver cancer and I need to order oil and bud and CANNOT get burned.&nbsp; I don&#039;t quite understand how it all works yet, but once MTGOX.COM gets off its ass and stops making excuses about not being able to register Dwolla account funds, I guess I can then do something about it.&nbsp; That&#039;s what you get when you are an old square.<br /><br />Greetings to all of you old-timers out there.&nbsp; Keep the faith.

				Keep in mind a good alternative to DWOLLA is Bitinstant, take cash to any albertsons and have bitcoins within an hour...<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried the following vendors:<br /><br />indica9 - opium - great prices, took forever (asia), ok quality I suppose but after all the trouble I will stick with more refined opiates<br /><br />theOCguy - old formula oxycontins - excellent prices, fantastic service, only issue was it took FOREVER to receive packages to US since it came from Europe I think...<br /><br />StealthRX - black tar heroin - first purchase was half gram, he asked for FE for cheap price, went good, gear was great, 2nd order he wanted a moneypak and took 3 weeks to get back to me, he&#039;s also a junkie so unreliable, finally came through but quality wasn&#039;t as good as the first time.<br /><br />Charliemustthrive - black tar heroin - started out with great prices, the gear was ok, cut with fentanyl I think... After my first order went perfect, he disappeared and made alot of people mad, I think he&#039;s a junkie, so unreliable... Wouldn&#039;t try my luck again<br /><br />FastForward - black tar heroin (obsidian tar) - a little pricey ($200/gm), but good gear, great service, excellent stealth, and fast turnaround<br /><br />WeedersDigest - yoda OG kush - good pricing, pretty good quality (not the best medical grade), excellent stealth, and decent turnaround &lt;1 week<br /><br />SmileAwhile - &#039;The Best China White&#039; #4 Heroin - My first time trying #4 or using this vendor, (his gear is arguably the best on SR) Just made my first order a couple days ago, been communicating with him via pm, he was kinda rude and told me that he doesnt care about my review of his product since people in USA dont know &quot;shit from clay when it comes to heroin,&quot; and for me to stop bugging him unless it&#039;s been over 8 days since package was marked in transit. So my customer service experience hasn&#039;t been the greatest so far but maybe he had a bad day. Still looking forward to receiving it since I&#039;ve read so many great reviews about his stealth packaging and his gear, only thing I&#039;m apprehensive about is signing for the package... Will update when received.
