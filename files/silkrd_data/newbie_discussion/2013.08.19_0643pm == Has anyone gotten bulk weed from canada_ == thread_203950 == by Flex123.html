				Just wanna find out has anyone recieved AAA top shelf weed in bulk from canada vendors to the USA? Reason am asking this again is cause there are some canada vendors who say they have AAA purp kush and will ship to USA? There no way this stuff could be top shelf at those low prices for LBs? Am paying any where from 3,100.00 to 3,400.00 for LBs from vendors in USA and it is Top Shelf all the way.

				I am in the same boat. I have talked to a vendor by the name of &quot;mrouid&quot;! His stats are solid and his prices are great, he claims to have shipped products to USA with no problem for the most part. I have not yet made my order because i found similar prices and the quality in USA for bulk weed. But if anyone has ordered BULK* from &quot;mrouid&quot;, please share your experience. All thought, he does have great insurance policies, well very reasonable.. <br /><br />P.S What are the vendors you guys are referring about??

				You could always place a small sample order to test the quality before buying in bulk. Best of luck man.

				actually PKHYDRO is a very good candian seller, only does domestic. but hes rating ar fucking awsome also white shark is good, remember the prices may be low but that dont mean the product is shit, it could mean ur getting it straight from the grower, i know PKHYDRO is a grower so theres no middlemen involved .. hightestmmdg also mentions they are a team of growers on who cut out the middlemen thus explaining the prices .. hope this helped&nbsp;

				From what I can see so far... the best priced quality weed all comes from British Columbia Canada.... Google some video&#039;s on the subject.&nbsp; &nbsp; For instance in one particular town it&#039;s believed that 1 in every 7 houses is maintaining a grow up.<br /><br />The point I&#039;m trying to make is.&nbsp; The reason AAA&nbsp; weed can go for 2000 to 2500 in canada, is simply cause there is an absolute shit ton of it grown in canada, and the more there is the lower the price... The more people growing it the more knowledge and available seed there is to help foster more people with the knowledge and proper seed etc...&nbsp; BC is the world hub of killer weed. (soon to be taken over by Colorado and Washington of course.. lol)<br /><br />As for the growers, suggesting teams of growers, botanists and hippies etc...&nbsp; That may of been true when they started (there own grow0.. but I think now that they are busy, most of their products is coming from neighbors (probably from the same town i was talking about above)... And I&#039;m sure any good grower would consider themselves A Grower, botanist or Hippy.&nbsp; I seriously doubt most of them went to college or university, but there is always exceptions to the rule.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also remind you that it&#039;s been possible in Canada to procure a license to grow medical Marijuana... In fact with the right doctor, and the right amount of cash almost anyone, if they are dedicated enough to pursue it can get a license.&nbsp; I personally now know 3 people who have a license to smoke it, and 2 people that have a license to grow it.&nbsp; Thus you are now considered a &quot;certified Grower&quot; of Medical Marijuana in canada.&nbsp; When in actual fact you might not know how to grow a potato.<br /><br />All that said, I&#039;ve ordered amazing product form PKhydro, and Hightestmmdg.&nbsp; However, I would assume like most vendors dealing in large qauntities, quality tends to vary batch to batch to batch.&nbsp; As they need to procure product continually from thier &quot;neighbors&quot;.&nbsp; But I&#039;m confident with those 2 vendors that the quality should remain AAA to AAA+.

Tomorrow I&#039;m going to visit a full-scale grow-op in order to gather more samples. The master of the house is an old hippy who grows great dope and many different strains. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have an SR vendor account yet but hopefully will soon. In the meantime I&#039;d like to communicate with people down there interested in the weed up here. Of course I&#039;d prefer to deal with someone in bulk that I can simply smuggle across however I&#039;m also thinking of ways to send small packages by mail. At any rate, please let me know what you think...

But this price discrepancy must be attributed to factors other than quality because the ratio of talented horticulturalists to amateurs is probably about the same in Canada and Cali both of which are home to around 35,000,000. But then again, because the consequences of getting busted was a laughing matter up here, even those who never grew a vegetable garden got into the action. Let me know if you want a sample.
