				Fuck Yeah! I&#039;m in! Its still slow and weird but i&#039;m on! I have been lurking and contemplating whether to try the road out and as soon as i got my nerve up this all went down but the last couple days of thinking i&#039;d missed my chance has made my mind up. I&#039;m in, I guess i&#039;ll find out if SR was the best thing to come in my life or a new addiction to be feared and/or managed. lol

				I got in placed an order and got out. I would suggest that anyone needing to complete business does asap so as to allow other users to get it. <br /><br />The shere volume of traffic tryiing to log on atm is probably the reason why its hard to get on. DPR and his team is in front at the moment and has the gate open and has manage to get the defences up to stop the DDOS.<br /><br />I hold no fear that SR will regain full functionality some time soon.<br /><br />Have faith newbies !!! :)

				After patiently waiting and a few identity switches, i was able to successfully log in and place an order.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine what the SR team is going through.&nbsp; Who knows when the order will be fulfilled, but that is the least of my concerns.

				Yeah Man! How sweet it is! Further on down the road....<br /><br />Deja Vu!&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to see some of the ground up peyote that came around out west a few times. It was cool stuff, sort of powdered, and it didn&#039;t taste too bad, but it did gag you as you had to eat about a quarter cup of it. Went to float a river one weekend with a big bag of it. We never put the canoes in the water. We were so high I couldn&#039;t get my feet to touch the ground so I just laid out in the crystal clear cool river water and told the passing canoeist to keep their paddles out of the water going through the next long pool just down the river; because there was a 300 lb. snapping turtle that had been snapping off people&#039;s paddles and he could even knock a canoe over! We would watch and about 1 out of 3 canoeist would be holding their paddle up out of the river as they went through the pool sidewards! <br />I got many other Merry Prankster tripster stories...&nbsp; Have you been acid high and couldn&#039;t stop laughing until it began to scare you? I mean like you are starting to hurt, can&#039;t remember why you started laughing...but you can&#039;t stop...and everything and everybody just seems hilarious! Say, Oh God! Where is the First Aid Tent? You&#039;re gonna have to take me there if I can&#039;t stop this - I&#039;m going to explode! And then that is funny too! Oh, you&#039;ll come down; it&#039;s just a drug like any other drug... it&#039;s not digesting like food, but it&#039;s going through it&#039;s half lifes, and it will wear off eventually.
