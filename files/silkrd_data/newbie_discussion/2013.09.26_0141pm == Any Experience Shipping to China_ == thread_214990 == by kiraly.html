				I&#039;m from a Western country living in China. Have there been any vendors here who have shipped to China? If so, what have the experiences been like? How common the problems occur and what type of problems are they? If you refuse to ship to China, what are your reasons? Any related information would be appreciated.<br /><br />I&#039;m aware that China&#039;s drug laws aren&#039;t the most lenient in the world, so no need to lecture me on that. I just want to weigh my options (and do further research) before seeing if ordering from SilkRoad is worth a shot.

				If I were you, I&#039;d care less about getting things shipped to me... I&#039;d set up a vendor account, contact some drug/chemical suppliers, and be shipping out.

				The thing is: I&#039;m only a consumer. I don&#039;t want to be going into the drug trade for various reasons.<br /><br />In addition to that, I&#039;m only interested in the softest of drugs: weed, which is ridicuously difficult to find here (add to the trouble that I don&#039;t live in a tier 1 city). None of the kids even knew what I was talking about when I mentioned &quot;dàmá&quot; in Chinese. The ones that had any clue about the market mentioned that only Cocaine, Ketamine, Ecstasy, and some synthetic drugs that I didn&#039;t understand were of interest for the most part.<br /><br />Thus, I still want to reiterate: any suppliers have any intel about shipping to China?<br /><br />

				On the subject of suppliers from China, I see drzhang as a supplier for a lot of synthetic products. Is there a high enough demand for them that would merit another supplier in China? I already mentioned that I&#039;m not interested in getting into the trade, but I&#039;ll continue researching into this and if I do happen to get myself involved, the most I&#039;ll ever get involved in is as a middleman. I&#039;ll continue scouring through the threads to educate myself, however.

				Not sure how strict Chinese customs are, but I&#039;ve shipped packages (non drug related) from the U.S to family throughout Asia with decent delivery time and little hassle. Vendors have shipped plenty of drugs into Australia, which as far as I know has one of the strictest customs centers (like 99% of international packages go through Sidney). I don&#039;t imagine it will be too difficult to have weed sent to you, possibly find a vendor in Asia. Definitely a few Ive seen in southeast Asia. hope that helps?

				I appreciate your starting point as a response. Perhaps I&#039;ll give it a shot, but since delivery times take a while, I&#039;ll probably wait till after I do my visa run.<br /><br />Any vendors with direct experience (or at least a statement of no experience) with shipping to China? I&#039;m going to start contacting vendors about this, but I just thought it&#039;d feel less spammy to throw out a blanket thread first instead of adding +1 to a couple of private inboxes.

				Lol. North Korea restricted?<br /><br />Has ANYONE received an order to be sent to North Korea? Anyone? Please surprise me.<br /><br />On a more relevant vein, I received two responses: one with a vendor who has no experience with shipping to China and another saying that there are no problems with parcel delivery from his/her experience.<br /><br />Might just give this a shot. I just need to figure out how to receive mail first. I&#039;ve done some KuaiDi delivery before via Taobao, but I don&#039;t know what happens when it comes to mail that do not require signatures.<br /><br />Of course, any other feedback would be appreciated.
