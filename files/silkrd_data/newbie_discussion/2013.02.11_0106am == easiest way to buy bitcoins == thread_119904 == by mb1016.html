				If you are in America, I have had nothing but good experiences with bitinstant through moneygram. It can sometimes be a bit difficult guiding the cashier through a process they may have never done before, but it is fairly simple, works, and does not require a ton of ID.

				I am going to try at CVS tomorrow.. I had purchased ten at a place called Coinbase - and I still have 6 more days to wait for them to clear my payment.&nbsp; I wish I had understood more before I bought with Coinbase.&nbsp; &nbsp;I sure hope CVS and the moneygram works in the morning.. I&#039;m tired of waiting for my money to go into a wallet..... so I can figure out how to get it to SR.... which I still am mystified about.

Go to Account and you will see a BTC address, send the money to that one and it should show up in your account within a couple hours.
