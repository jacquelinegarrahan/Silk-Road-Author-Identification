At least the rumor mill section should be available for newbies IMO.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For those that are still less than 50 posts you may still start a new review thread or trip report in the noob section.&nbsp; In the title of the post just post the vendor name and the product with review.&nbsp; Those that use the search function like I do would still find it useful.&nbsp; I still want to see serious trip reports and vendor feedback from those with less than 50 posts.&nbsp; Time will tell what net effect this change ultimately has on the viability of the system as a whole.&nbsp;

				Yeah I agree, as they show up in search they are still valuable. I always search the vendors name before purchasing, so any relevant posts are interesting regardless of which forum they are in.<br /><br />Better to post a review in here than not at all...

				&nbsp;Newbie reviews don&#039;t really mean much anyway though, it could easily just be a seller making smurf accounts.

				Unless you&#039;ve been here for a while but just simply didn&#039;t use the forums all that much. But I can see the whole smurf account thing.

				I guess it would be difficult to tell the difference between a vendor&#039;s smurf account and a user, like me, who really only posts when he feels it&#039;s important.<br />

				It&#039;s a good idea to have some sort of post count as most forums do but 50 is a bit high in my opinion

				I think many people only come to the forums to vet a potential vendor, or to complain if they got burned. Recently I decided to become more active in the community but don&#039;t feel like spamming the forums with 50 nonsense posts... Over time newbie review threads that are indeed smurfs will present themselves as such. (only a few posts all for a specific vendor)..
