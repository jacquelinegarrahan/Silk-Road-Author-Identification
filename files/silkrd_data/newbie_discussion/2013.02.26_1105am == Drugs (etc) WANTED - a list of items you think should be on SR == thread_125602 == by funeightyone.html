				I&#039;d like to see what you would like to see listed on SR and for what price. (realistically please)<br /><br />I&#039;m working on becoming a vendor and I&#039;m prepared to offer a few items:<br /><br />1. the best of the best quality uncut heroin<br />2. re mailing services (paranoid about buying drugs from overseas - or anywhere- and having them shipped to your house? I&#039;d let you ship them to me and then I&#039;d forward them to you for a small fee - making sure to double check and improve stealth if necessary)<br />3. buying services (say you have lots of BTC that you need to launder - you could come to me to buy anything your heart desires from food to clothes to cars to houses to furniture to pets. and you could buy them with btc - thereby removing the need to launder)<br />4. Gold bullion (and other precious metals) and certified diamonds in exchanged for BTC (at a rate equal to market value). Most precious metals along with diamonds have increased in value over the last five years at a rate that is equal to or (most often) greater than the stock market. If you are a BIG vendor selling in the $200,000 a year or more range, converting some excess BTC to gold, doamonds, or precious metals would be a very safe and easily liquidable (yet untracable) way to launder money. Shipping 1600 dollars in 100 dollar bills weighs just under sixteen grams. Shipping 1600 dollars in gold bullion weighs 28 grams and has the added benefit of being completely legal worldwide and completely insurable worldwide. <br />5. Possibly personal stash amounts of shrooms, Ketamine, washed coke (guaranteed 85% pure or more), and a special opiate that won&#039;t show up on drug tests but still gives a very strong OC like buzz.<br />6. Stamps for all forms of USPS mail - so you could slap a stamp on something like one of those flat rate express mail or priority mail envelopes and throw it in a blue mail box without ever looking a postal working int he eye. <br />7. Packaging services: ie: send me a kg (or whatever amount) of mdma (or other powder form drugs) and I can use my capsule filling machine to fill caps (they come in a wide variety of sizes) with a very precise weight of drug (accurate to the mg) and then either ship them back to you or ship them directly to your customers for a fee. <br /><br />give me some feedback on those items and...<br /><br />What else would people like to see?

				Quaaludes (methaqualone/Mandrax)! I&#039;m too young to have ever tried &#039;ludes, but I&#039;m just so fucking curious, because my friends who have done ludes say they&#039;re a great orgy drug, especially combined with coke. I know they&#039;re popular in South Africa, but who knows what the quality is like. There is a South African vendor on here who sells them, but they&#039;re currently out of stock. Plus I&#039;m not that comfortable buying internationally, so it would be awesome if someone in the US would make them.<br /><br />As my friend is always telling me, I&#039;m sure there are better drugs out there now, but it&#039;s just a long-term dream of mine to try Quaaludes.

				I don&#039;t think Vassopressin is &quot;the monogamy molecule&quot; I think you are thinking of oxytocin. Vassopressin is used to treat children who wet the bed, but it has an awesome side effect. The side effect is that it facilitates the the conversion from short term memory to long term memory. I&#039;d like to get it to use for a study aid. Tim Ferris said that he was using it to memorize Kanji (Japanese/Chinese character alphabet) and he said that he could cram a few hours before an exam, do well on the exam, and he still remember them. I&#039;m sure he still remembers them not only because he probably continued to use them but still....I want some. <br /><br />+1 for you sir for the vassopressin (nasal spray). I&#039;d also like to see oxytocin although I have never heard of anyone producing it.

				I agree with the person that said hydrocodone. Specifically 10/325 V imprint Norco brand. There aren&#039;t much on SR and the ones that got &#039;em are butt raping customers on the price. Get an American supply of hydro for 5 bucks a 10mg and you&#039;d sell out in a day.

				Hi.<br />I am not sure what the actual name/term for this speed but here are 3 pointers that i can clearly recall: <br />- smelt like dead ants. Looks like slightly wet brown suger.<br />- When snorted, burns rediculasly for good couple of minuts and makes you eyes water.. <br />- 20 min after having, if you were sitting down, you just get up and want to do push ups lol ..or many other activities ;D<br /><br />Im hoping someone knows exactly what im talking about and could please point out the name of the product =)) Used to just be called dead ants in Australia that is. Shits on meth as you are while feeling crazy ampt - thinking clear and perfectly aware of what you doing. Clean.<br />——————<br />Also would like to see some more hardwear on SR. Car unlocking/emobiliser sort of tools. lel. I want to do a rally project

				ALL USA DOMESTIC:<br /><br />High-Quality BULK P2NP<br />BULK 30mg Roxi&#039;s (around 50cents/mg)<br />High-Quality BULK Oxycodone powder<br />High-Quality BULK LSD Crystals<br />High-Quality BULK 2CB powder<br />High-Quality BULK MDA powder<br />High-Quality BULK Ephedrine HCL powder<br />High-Quality BULK Phentermine HCL powder<br />High-Quality BULK Xanax powder<br />High-Quality BULK Benzo powders (ANY and ALL)<br />High-Quality BULK Sassafras Oil (PURE 95%+)<br />High-Quality BULK Precursors/Chems (Mercuric Chloride, p-Benzoquinone, etc)<br /><br />I put BULK as that is all that I&#039;m interested in.&nbsp; You could also sell smaller amounts at a higher price per gram of course.&nbsp; High-Quality, pure Cocaine is available all over California and Florida....it&#039;s just not available on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I list is not readily available AT ALL....at least not US Domestic.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like the idea of a remailer service, but you&#039;d need to list the product to purchase and then provide the extended ETA so that everyone knows the deal.&nbsp; Also, offering this WITHOUT FE would be great....I think this service would be used non-stop.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				1)&nbsp; High quality heroin&nbsp; which really gives euphoria and pleasurable body feelings, not just a nod.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought from 7 vendors and while all the heroin was strong, none compared with heroin from years ago which was much more pleasurable.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Pure cocaine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered from 2 highly recommended vendors and, compared with cocaine from the 1970&#039;s this was crap.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; Genuine opium.

				That&#039;s like asking what more items you want in a Walmart Supercenter. I know it doesn&#039;t answer your question, but SR has never let me down. I seriously can&#039;t think of a single thing that SR has ever failed to deliver.
