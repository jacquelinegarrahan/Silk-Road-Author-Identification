				Yes, I was wondering about this too when I had my first nbome (i looove this stuff).<br />anyway, it&#039;s probably due to the death that happened last year and IF I&#039;M NOT MISTAKEN (this was really difficult to figure out because I am not good with reading chemical compound names etc) - Nbomes are a derivative of 2cI and 2cI is schedule in aus.<br /><br />the schedules are updated so frequently its crazy. tonight on triple j they were discussing the most recent death due to synthetic drugs , and i just realised how crazy it is that the NSW govt is considering the legalization of synthetic drugs AFTER they have undergone testing.<br /><br />I mean - WHY NOT LEGALIZE CANNABIS AND LSD AND MDMA of which have ALLL been chemically tested.<br />this prove that there is a generational gap in the structure and intent of our laws - the older generation wanted it banned because of what IT DID, and the current generation are banning it because of what IT IS.<br /><br />way off topic.. but what do you guys think? wouldn&#039;t you guys feel abit strange that LSD is illegal whilst something like nBOMES are legal AFTER BEING LAB TESTED?<br />

				i agree. and if parents would rather their kids buy drugs of dealers (of whom assume NO LEGAL LIABLITY FOR THEIR PRODUCT) then they can continue to vote for conservative and out of date laws.<br />if my kids are doing drugs i want them to have the best quality drugs from a good source - i can&#039;t wait till this generation of politicians are out of the way. all they think about is money and oil - pfft. you can&#039;t eat any of that. at least cannabis can be eaten as a vegetable. bunch of fools.
