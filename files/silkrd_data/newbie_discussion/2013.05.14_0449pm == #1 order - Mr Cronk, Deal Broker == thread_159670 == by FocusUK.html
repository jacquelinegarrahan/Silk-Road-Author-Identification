				So after a lot of reading I decided to give SR a try. I was impressed with the variety and supposed quality of the drugs available. And since I recently relocated, I have no reliable local suppliers.<br /><br />I decided to order 2g of Thai (haven&#039;t been able to get this for years) from MrCronk, and 1g speed paste from Deal Broker.<br /><br />They are both currently &#039;processing&#039; but I am expecting them to ask me to FE, since I am a new user. Judging by their feedback I suppose I will trust them. *Fingers crossed*.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update when/if I receive my orders and give my opinion on the service, speed, quality and packaging.<br /><br />Peace

				Patience is key.&nbsp; If these two aren&#039;t successful, try other vendors.<br /><br /><br />Again, Never FE&nbsp;

				Good luck. If you want to get your rating up quickly look in the books section and buy a few cheap ebooks.

				McCronk has generally great feedback and I don&#039;t see him stiffing you over 2g of Thai weed. On the other hand the general consensus is never FE&nbsp; :o<br /><br />There are enough vendors on SR who will be happy to play ball with you, so go with your gut and good luck!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the replies. I&#039;ll buy some cheap ebooks when they become available. I didn&#039;t want to FE but it seems the top domestic sellers are asking for it.

				I agree with londonpride2, if you&#039;re willing to risk a small amount and the vendor has good rep (in the forums and the reviews) then you&#039;ll be fine 90% of the time.&nbsp; The &quot;No FE&quot; rule is really just the safest policy.&nbsp; But everyone has their own tolerance for risk.

I thought I would make a few small orders until I&#039;m comfortable with the system and trust it. I&#039;ve spent about Â£35 so it wouldn&#039;t be the end of the world if I lost it, this is just my trial run of SR and why I used two different vendors. If it&#039;s a success, which I hope it is, I&#039;ll be making some much larger orders.<br /><br />Also love the revolutionary aspect and sticking it to the man ;) <br /><br />Peace

				Btw both vendors offered next day delivery, I&#039;m still getting &#039;processing&#039; after 24 hours and have had no messages or been asked to FE or anything. Is this usual? I suppose they&#039;ll be prioritizing bigger orders.<br /><br />Peace
