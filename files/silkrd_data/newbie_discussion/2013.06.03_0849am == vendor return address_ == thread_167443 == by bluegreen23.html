				stupid follow up question from the other side of the coin.<br />How are bitcoins emailed to people? <br /><br />I&#039;m not familiar with the process at all from an email stand point. So please treat me like I&#039;m an idiot (not hard is it?) and give me a start to finish of the process.

				welcome to being the first actual unhelpful person I&#039;ve spoken with. Though I&#039;ve read some of your posts and I know you are a helpful contributor to the forum, why even post such a pointless reply? Do you somehow think I&#039;m just sitting back and not reading threads or trying to search out answers for my many many (MANY) questions? Well let me clear it up for you. <br /><br />I&#039;m new here obviously, I&#039;m inexperienced,&nbsp; and I am trying hard to learn and not be another one of those &quot;noob mediocre risky&quot; vendors. Currently I&#039;m not even vending, nor do I plan to anytime soon because the learning curve is steep. So have I done inexhaustible research on which method every vendor does and what is widely agreed upon as the best and why. Yes and no. I haven&#039;t specifically searched out ever corner of this forum or any other forum for info on this particular question. However I have read post... after post... after post.. after yet more posts. pages and pages and pages. Do you know how long it takes to read through 15 pages of threads in just one subforum? Never mind anything that I don&#039;t understand from any of the posts in a single thread. So before going back to searching nearly aimlessly and getting consistently side tracked trying to understand things that are simply not clear to me at this time for one reason or another. I was hoping for a quick simple concise answer or even a link to a post that might contain the answer so that I could put to rest what is seemingly a simple problem for most vendors, could be a problem for buyers, and what risks there are for each.<br /><br />did you know that if you type in vendor return address you receive 24 pages of hits? at 30 hits per page? Some of these are completely pointless and have nothing to do with my question. Some I&#039;ve already read. Some are similar questions with no follow up answer. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11831.msg110940#msg110940 <br />Asked many similar questions to mine. No answer given. So much for researching that. <br /><br />The consensus seems to be use fake, however this too can put a buyer in danger. As per<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.msg1175916#msg1175916<br /><br />This vendor uses a real business address that is totally unrelated to his own.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119672.msg808961#msg808961<br /><br />in this thread the claim is to use a fake name but real address such as an apt block<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156945.msg1114488#msg1114488<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133573.msg908633#msg908633 this one just says use a real one because fake ones are suspicious.<br /><br />So with that pointless waste of a few hours reading through god knows how many posts and still unclear. What is an agreed upon acceptable method that does it&#039;s best to negate risk to vendor (hence no real return address) and doesn&#039;t put the buyer at risk (dead parcel department filled with product and a buyers name and partial address on it)?<br />what are the other options? pro/con to them (and no I don&#039;t need the obvious)<br />is there a method so that if something isn&#039;t delivered it can be returned, thus not losing the contents of perhaps a high value package? <br /><br />

				Sorry BGF It wasn&#039;t at all personal, it&#039;s just this question seems to come up every fuckin week! <br /><br />&nbsp;Considering this IS an ANONYMOUS&nbsp; marketplace, what do YOU honestly think?&nbsp; What did you discover when you searched this question?<br /><br />We do understand what it&#039;s like to be new here and feel a little out of our depth, <br />however we now have spent the quivalent of 3 or 4 WEEKS on these fora, which seems to be the only way to obtain the knowledge we required ;o<br /><br />&nbsp; It&#039;s not the most clever thing for a vendor to put a GENUINE addy is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;Why on earth would they do that?&nbsp; Shit they may as well include their fb profile as well!<br /><br />Bottom line, UNLESS&nbsp; they want to risk the chance of a visit from LE, the logical choice is to put NOTHING THAT CAN BE CONNECTED TO THEM!!<br /><br />Some out false addys, some use fake addys and some out no addy at all, there are NO rules in this game<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br /><br />Hmmmmm m m motek ;)

				I understand that I acted like a spoiled little bitch and I should be quiet, read more, and listen to more experienced wiser members. Thanks for the patience. sorry for getting snappy.<br /><br />Some days I get frustrated with how much info there is and trying to understand it all, how it relates and whats current versus old so I got lazy with this one. But you were right with your first post. If I can&#039;t research on my own before asking the dumb questions then I shouldn&#039;t be considering a future in vending.<br /><br />Sorry man.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s better to use a real return address (as in an address that exists, not your own address), because a bogus return address is obviously suspicious. You should also make sure the address you use has the same ZIP code as the area you send it from. Some vendors write the return address of an actual shop, to make it look like an online order, and others just make a business name up and use the address of an office or apartment block.<br />It&#039;s generally advised to make it seem like business mail here so I would use the address of a real shop, and use printed labels, etc. Also, don&#039;t use the same address all the time to prevent the postal service or customs to inspect all of your packages after they&#039;ve intercepted one (it&#039;s happened before).<br /><br />here is some pretty good info taken from http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/ I&#039;d read all that, there is more information on the forums but it&#039;s scattered, reading polyfront is a good start. Read section &quot;smuggling&quot; to know how to safely send/get drugs in the mail.<br />This is a list of what would be suspicious :<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">* No return address<br />* Restrictive markings (such as writing &quot;Personal!&quot; on the envelope)<br />* Misspelled words<br />* Poorly typed or written text<br />* Excessive postage<br />* Addressed to an incorrect title<br />* Sent from a foreign country<br />* Sealed with tape<br />* Emits a strange odor (Including masking agents such as coffee, perfume and fabric softener sheets)<br />* Lopsided, uneven, rigid, bulky or otherwise uneven weight distribution<br />* Oily stains, discolorations and crystallization&#039;s on packaging<br />* Packaging appears to be re-used<br />* Package looks generally poorly prepared for shipping<br />* addresses are hand written<br />* addresses contain misspelled information (such as names, streets or cities)<br />* Originate from a drug source state<br />* Are addressed as being sent from an individual to an individual<br />* Return address ZIP code does not match ZIP code of the post office the package is being sent from<br />* A fictitious return address is used<br />* List a sender or receiver name of a common type (Such as John Smith)<br />* Make use of names that are not connected to either address<br />* Package makes noise when shaken<br />* Redistribution of weight is felt when package is moved or tilted<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				i think a real buisness address that you borrow is the best idea, and try and match the packaging of that buisness.
