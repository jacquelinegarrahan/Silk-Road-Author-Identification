				Schizofreen is an awesome vendor. He was my first SR order ever, international from the Netherlands to the States nonetheless. His communication is lightning fast, his stealth is pretty damn sneaky and creative, and of course his product is fantastic, definitely the best MDMA I&#039;ve ever had. I&#039;ve ordered his PARTYFLOCK pills in the past, and just placed my 3rd order with him, for a large amount of PARTYFLOCKs.

				Ive placed my first order with schizofreen for 75 partyflocks to the US, it&#039;s been a little over&nbsp; a week now, and i&#039;m expecting at least another week before arrival based on tracking info. So far he&#039;s been very responsive, processing took a bit but that&#039;s no issue. The tracking info conflicts with the marked in transit day, but I realize tracking can be wonky due to the sheer volume of post in the world.<br />I&#039;ll update on arrival.

				Hey everyone, so I ordered from schizofreen early febuary.&nbsp; He was my absolute first purchase here on the road so I contacted him and he asked if I could FE considering im a noob, so I did, ONLY because he had such good feedback and also because he told me hed provide me with a tracking number so I FE&#039;d I want to say the 7th of feb.&nbsp; He told me to wait at least a week before i try the tacking number so on day 8 I tried to track without tor and for some reason the link didnt work.&nbsp; I contacted him right away and he told me not to worry, to be patient and to give it some time.<br />This past thursday I got a package and it was my beautiful shipment of the Purple Party Flocks x50 =) I was so happy!<br /><br />This dude has great communication and he seems very chill.&nbsp; It took the whole month of Feb except for the first week for my order to come to East US.&nbsp; Enjoy your stuff when you get it, i cant wait to try my stuff out.&nbsp; Oh also, every single one was in perfect condition, very good packaging too.&nbsp; I think I found my pill guy, boy did I get lucky!
