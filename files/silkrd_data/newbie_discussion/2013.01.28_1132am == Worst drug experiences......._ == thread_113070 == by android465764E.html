				I&#039;m just curious. What was your worst experience to date?<br />I don&#039;t mean getting ripped of, but rather adverse reactions, bad trips, hospitalization, etc.&nbsp; And did it put you off, make your more cautious, or not bothered?<br /><br />Mine isn&#039;t terribly exciting. I got too greedy with E&#039;s one night and kept blacking out. Mini-fits and stuff. Did put me off for a good while.&nbsp;

				I made some bad experiences with being drunk and then smoking bong. The thing is when I take a bong hit I don&#039;t inhale like 5 times like smoking a joint, I kill that motherfucker with one big drag. When only smoking weed it&#039;s no problem at all, but drunk it often leads to feeling nauseous, sometimes I even had to vomit. One night I was taking speed in addition to alcohol and weed....well, that was too much, I vomited on my shirt around friends which was really disgusting and embarrassing. Anyway I learnt my lesson, 3 different substances at once are too much (at least for me).

				The first time any of us saw ketamine, a buddy sold us a 20 bag. We didn&#039;t know it was like ten doses for new jacks, so we did four lines. Just imagine four of us in a one bedroom apt, one at the kitchen sink, one at the toilet, one at the tub, and one in the bathroom sink. All vomiting for like two hours, I couldn&#039;t walk for another hour, but the other three were walking around in between ralphs, bitching. Four girls huddling by the door smoking weed, and complaining about the smell. Shit was awful, the next time I did it, I took a line that looked like a meth bump, and got super fucked up. I don&#039;t know how none of us OD&#039;d, I never did it again after the second time. I guess I just wanted to see how it was supposed to be,&nbsp; but I don&#039;t like downers.

				Mushrooms many years ago. I took too much, approximately 10g dried. Was at an indoor trance party with no chillout room and the music was too heavy for me. I just sat in a corner waiting for it to pass.<br />This was my only bad experience ever.<br />

				My worst experience ever out of the weed,shrooms,lsd,nbome,xtc,alcohol,and spice i have had would be the spice. I was on break at work and my friend had a j with some spice in it. i have done it before then but this time i was about to do it on break at work. I took one nice fat hit and went back inside,before i even had a chance to clock back in the shit hit me. i was more paranoid than osama bin laden . i felt like everyone was talking about me (the customers and the other employees.) it was somewhat hard for me to function. and when you are working with grease this weirded me out even more. smoking weed is no problem as long as i remember the visine. but yeah that spice shit just creeped me the fuck out and i havent done it since.

				A friend of mine just recently landed in jail for about 10 years. <br />He took tons of xanax and drank a bunch with his friends and ended up beating an old man half to death on the beach after the old man said something to him. They say he woke up the next morning, couldn&#039;t remember anything, and was sitting in a jail cell. Black out is far too common when taking bars with my grp of friends. hahha

My friends and I have smoked all differnt types of spice since the beginning since its pretty cheap and easy to get in our area. The last batch of spice they made with a different chemical and half of us had the worst trip of our lives. This coming from people who do some hardcore drugs in large amounts.

				Meth!!!<br /><br /><br />Back in the early 90&#039;s, no one did it, that was stuff for low life bikers and poor people. Anyways a buddy thought he had scored some blow and cut us all some big fat rails, as soon as we all did it we knew something wasn&#039;t right. Was up for 2 days before puking and having to be taken to emergency where they pumped us full of xanax.<br /><br />To this day the I hate meth. I never understood the desire of it.

				Well I wasn&#039;t on anything, but...<br /><br />Got a call from a friend saying he was in the hospital for a heroin overdose. He was dead when his brother found him in his house. The brother (daily marijuana user, but nothing more) called the ambulance and the police showed up as well. Searched the place and found the brother&#039;s pipes and some marijuana and took him to jail. Basically sacrificed a clean record and his time/money to save his brother. Long story short, it was a messy ordeal that kind of scared the shit out of me and made me think.<br /><br />So I guess this is my worst experience about drugs: a story of addiction and overuse. This guy was the most educated person I know, other than myself of course, about the dangers of drug use. Just remember it can happen to anyone. Just be careful people, stay away from addiction is all I can say.
