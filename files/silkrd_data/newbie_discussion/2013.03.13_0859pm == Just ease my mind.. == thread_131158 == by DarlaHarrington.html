				I&#039;ve made a few purchases so far. My first order has yet to arrive but I&#039;m aware of the issue. I paid priority on 2 other orders and one was shipped on Saturday and the other Monday. The Monday shipment is no big deal when it comes to length in transit but the Saturday one is a little concerning. When I order Kratom priority it&#039;s here in 2 days(from across the country). Am I just being a fiend or should I start contacting folks?&nbsp;

				Give it 5 business days, then send them a polite message asking about your order.

				Don&#039;t forget to add an extra day in case the package was dropped off in a delivery service&#039;s box, but it wasn&#039;t picked up until the next morning. Worst comes to worst, you&#039;ll have to send a polite message to the vendor. Remember, safety takes time and it&#039;s better to get a package in 5 days than no package at all.

				I&#039;ve posted several very well packaged orders abroad and they still haven&#039;t arrived over a week later.<br />I have them all tracked so I will know when they get there but you have to be patient with these things.<br /><br />Sometimes I post to a relative in Australia (from UK) and it takes 2-3 weeks!! That&#039;s even without contraband! lol.<br /><br />Anyway, relax a bit and be patient, give it a little longer and then mail the vendor. They&#039;re probably tracking it and concerned too.

				I&#039;ve never had an issue with an order except one time. It was the longest order I&#039;ve ever had to wait for, so I messaged the vendor about 9 days into it. He had the tracking number and it did in fact say it was marked as delivered 3 days into me placing the order. It wasn&#039;t a huge amount and since the tracking number did in fact say delivered, I chalked it up to a misdelivery with USPS and gave the vendor a 5/5.&nbsp; The cool thing was about a week after that, it arrived! Completely stealthy sealed and not tampered with at all. Sometimes the post office just fucks up, in this case,&nbsp; it was probably misdelivered and redelivered.

				WARNING!! Do not FE from anyone ever!! There are way too many vendors on here who do not give a damn about you or whether you receive your order or not!! Support will not help you, FE or not. If someone asks you to FE, just ask them to cancel the order. It just isn&#039;t worth it.

				don&#039;t fe and if your package not arriving yet concerns you then get in contact with the vendor and express your concern. this is a business being conducted, you have the right to ask questions politely. like in all aspects in life, don&#039;t be a dick and it makes everybody happier to help

				Reasons for vendors to ask for FE (I am a vendor btw) legitimate and not so:<br />1) The user has a high auto-finalize rate<br />2) The user has never ordered anything before, is brand new and has started with a $500+ order<br />3) It&#039;s a raffle<br />4) They aren&#039;t very confident in their stealth ability<br />5) lots of packages have gone missing<br />6) The buyer has needed a resend several times<br /><br />Reasons not to FE for the vendor:<br />1) Buyers can trust them and feel secure<br />2) You don&#039;t have to chase up the buyer and your stats look better<br /><br /><br />Reasons to FE for the buyer:<br />1) They want some freebies from the seller<br />2) They know the vendor well<br /><br />Reasons not to:<br />1) THEY WILL GET FUCKED OVER<br /><br /><br />Basic conclusion:<br />Don&#039;t do a deal where you&#039;re required to FE unless you have shit stats. I won&#039;t ask you to, but if you have crap stats I won&#039;t ask you to FE, I&#039;ll just cancel the order.<br /><br />Regards,<br />BL

				Thanks ByronLegosi for the breakdown! What&#039;s the best way to start out on the right foot with good stats, so that vendors won&#039;t need to ask for FE? Or is it best to do a few very small orders first and FE them early, so your stats are decent and you can afford to not have to FE? (I&#039;m interested in both buying and selling, btw)

(I&#039;m interested in both buying and selling, btw)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you can usually make a few orders, especially domestically, that are relatively small and the vendor won&#039;t ask you to FE. Once they&#039;ve done and you&#039;ve finalized legitimately a few orders then you can start to expect the vendor not to ask you to FE. If they do, either refuse, ask why or cancel the order yourself. You will almost certainly find the same product from someone else who won&#039;t ask you to FE.<br /><br />As a vendor, firstly, don&#039;t start with listings that you can&#039;t afford to lose. I&#039;ve started small with ones that (and it&#039;s looking like I may have to) I can afford to either resend or refund, that way you don&#039;t need to FE. Once you get a good rating as a vendor then you may ask for FE on larger orders at the buyers risk rather than yours but in my honest opinion, if you have chosen to be a vendor on Silk Road then you should be prepared to ALWAYS use escrow. <br /><br />The exceptions of course having been listed above.<br /><br />All the best and good luck,<br />BL
