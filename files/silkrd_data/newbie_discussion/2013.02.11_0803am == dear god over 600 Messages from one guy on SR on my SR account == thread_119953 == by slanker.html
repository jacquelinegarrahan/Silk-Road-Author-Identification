Ok I&#039;m fine with that. What I am not fine with is I have over 600 messages from this fucker and I can&#039;t cancel my order and it keeps auto sending. Its bloody anoying. I do have some messages in there I do like. I cant seem to block him nore can I cancle the order.

The vendor can cancel your order at anytime though.

				Yes, remove everything. I don&#039;t see the point in keeping any messages after you have read them unless it&#039;s needed as evidence in a dispute with a vendor in the Resolution Center. Keeping messages just leaves evidence of your activities on SR should your account ever fall into the wrong hands. It may seem far fetched. but it&#039;s happened before.
