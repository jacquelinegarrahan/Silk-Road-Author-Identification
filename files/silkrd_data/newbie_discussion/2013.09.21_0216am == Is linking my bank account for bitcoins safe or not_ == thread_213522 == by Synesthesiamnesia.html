				Okay, so I want to use coinbase, for example, as my method for buying bitcoins. It seem relatively cheap, even though I&#039;ve read that it takes about a week to actually pull through. Anyways, I was wondering if linking my bank account is a bad idea if I wanted to keep my tread marks invisible? I was thinking of maybe buying it from coinbase, transferring it to blockchain, or some other wallet, then transferring that to silk. Would that not accomplish anything or how does it work?

				You&#039;d want to do more, such as run it through a tumbler/mixer like bitcoinfog... you didn&#039;t mention trying to use it, but not sure how great blockchain&#039;s mixer is even if you were to use it.<br /><br />Ideally you&#039;d not want to have a connected bank account at all,&nbsp; and buy your coin through localbitcoin anonymous meets/bank deposits.&nbsp;

				That&#039;s the thing, I&#039;d have to pay another fee for mixing it. I want to just pay off the fee for buying bitcoins and then just transfer it immediately. I guess that would be the smart way (mixing it, or just using cash deposit), but I&#039;m wondering if things got complicated and they intercepted a package that they would be able to link coinbase with silk road...

You should check it out.<br /><br />Basically what you want to take from the article is - if you don&#039;t mix/launder your coins in and out of SR you should expect to be caught (sooner or later).

				Okay, fair enough lol. Bad idea. Buuuuuut...I just looked on BlockChain again and saw their send/share option<br />https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-shared<br /><br />Would that be the same as mixing it? It&#039;s only .5% which is nothing, so would I be able to link account, buy it from coinbase, mix it on blockchain, then transfer to silkroad?

				I think I remember on of the resident security experts here doing a test with blockchain&#039;s mixer, and it really didn&#039;t cut it.<br /><br />Bitcoinfog&#039;s is looked at as safer.

There are many ways you can buy your coins anonymously, did it occur to you why the easy ways to get coins require you to deanonymize yourself? don&#039;t do it mate, its the weak link in the chain.

Do your research. Exchanges like CampBX do not require verification unless you&#039;re transferring more than $1K/day. You can make deposits with postal money orders with nothing more than your login name and email.

				Id say no...if small and limited do it,,,if paranoid and trying to be safe buy local!!<br /><br />if u want to be safe blockchain.info has a recieve service to mix and share the coins so it takes away traces...this is .5% and coinbase should implement it.<br /><br />I find it wierd how CoinBase shows when its from coinbase users or not, how can there system tell this when address&#039; come random from network?:(:)

				Not really weird. The address may be randomly generated, but it would be certain Coinbase would know they&#039;d both done business with Coinbase!

				i must admit I am guilty of doing this; however I never went straight from coinbase to Sr, I always used a 3rd wallet as an intermediate, althouhg not sure what that will do other than prevent me from getting shot right out of the gate by coinbase. I&#039;d recommend using bitcoinfog from now on, thats my plan. That all being said I haven&#039;t even done 5 btc through coinbase so I may just be lucky so far. Hopefully it won&#039;t come back to bite me in the ass if I quit while I&#039;m ahead.
