				I want to share my bad experience with SL vendor Fantastictimes and see if anyone has run into similar problems with him. The first time I&#039;ve bought 1 gram of methylone from this vendor, the quality was excellent. It was a regular small crystal m1 with its characteristic sweet smell. The second time I bought 5 grams when in the late February the vendor ran a sale advertising &quot;Large crystal methylone&quot;. Both times the vendor shipped extremely fast and I gave him high marks before I tried the product. The product that I got the second time looked exactly like Moonrock MDMA, beige to light brownish substanse and didn&#039;t have any smell at all. Or more precisely it had an extremely faint, barely recognizable smell, but nothing like m1 or other substituted cathinones.&nbsp; I don&#039;t take drugs more often then once every 6 weeks, so by the time I got to try it, it was April. I took 250mg on an empty stomach and after 40 minutes only felt a mild buzz. I added another 100mg and then another 150mg. I only felt mild non-specific buzz, without any mental or bodily euphoria. Typically on m1 I feel the waves pulsing through my body in response to the music and also if I move any part of my body. None of this was happening.&nbsp; I tried plugging 200mg, the dosage that on its own by this ROA normally would sent me blasting through the roof. I got no additional effect. I gave this stuff to my friends and they too only felt a mild buzz. All of them were sure that this was not methylone.&nbsp; <br /><br />A week ago I contacted the vendor and got no reply. I&#039;ve contacted SL moderators 3 days ago and so fa heard nothing from them either. That goes to show how useful &quot;report a vendor&quot; option is. Has anyone else been scammed by Fantastictimes? Did anybody come across this substances and have any idea what the substance is? Fantastictimes still sells large crystal methylone and I see it being offered by more and more vendors. And it gets rave reviews from the users! But I did find a few references on the web where people described exactly the same product like I got, which was claimed by vendors to be but was not methylone. I figure out that one of the batches of new large crystal methylone that Fantastictimes got turned out to be bunk. To get rid of it he ran a sale at $18 a gram, and I was one of the unlucky buyers who ended up with this junk, which I hope, will not turn out to be poisonous in the long run. Now, this vendor is very good at packaging and sends stuff very quickly. But if my experience tells you anything, next time he gets garbage - perhaps unsafe garbage from his suppliers, he will unscrupulously pass it on to you, his customers. Make you own conclusions!

				After I posted this the vendor finally responded. He mentioned that he is selling the same stuff that other vendors on SL are selling. I can attest to that as several of my friends got the same substance passed as M1. I have asked the vendor to send me the same high quality methylone that he sent me the first time. I will keep updating this thread.<br /><br />I am surprised that nobody else commented about a similar experience. Beta-ketones such as methylone, butylone and ethylone have a similar sweet smell. Other substances do not smell like it. For example 5-Methyl Ethylone (5-Methyl-bk-MDEA) lacks this smell or, in fact, any smell. Other canthinones, such as 4-MEC have a much harder chemical scent.&nbsp; Then there is the effect. The buzz from this substance is somewhat similar to 3,4 DMMC or R-MMC, but then I researched these substances just once because they were not satisfying. Just like this chemical.

Even if you had a large tolerance you would feel normal m1 at 185 mg, and should be able to get a good roll from 335mg. Maybe not as good as the first 10 times, but nevertheless, a very good roll. It should not take 785mg to get you there - that should cause all sorts of unpleasant side-effects. How long was your roll?<br />Methylone on the empty stomach always hits me in 24 minutes and I get about 2 hours of good roll, if I don&#039;t redose.<br /><br />What does your methylone look and smell like? Is it similar to what Fantastictimes has (light brownish crystals, very much like molly, with no scent) or traditional salt-like sweet smelling crystal? If yours is like Fantastictimes&#039;s, have you tested it with reagent kit? If you did, or if you don&#039;t mind doing it, could you please describe the results? (reagent, color change and color change time) <br />Thanks.

				This large crystal &quot;methylone&quot; is now being offered by more and more vendors. In a crystal form it has no smell. The small crystal methylone has the same sweet vanilla-like scent as the same type of methylone powder does. So yesterday I crashed this new &quot;methylone&quot; into fine powder. The powder did have a very light scent reminiscent of M1. That gave me a wild idea. Do you guys know what 4P is? It is a recrystalized&nbsp; mixture of two different cathinones 4-mec and pentedrone in a 70%/30% ratio. Here is the reference: http://www.chemicalservices.net/buy-research-chemicals/buy-4-p-crystals.html. I&#039;ve had both chemicals as well as 4P. I much prefer them separately, but that might be just me. The point here is that rather than selling the mixture of two, which would have the same effects as 4P crystal, somebody came up with a recrystallization process to make a more presentable product. It is possible that for the reasons of cost, somebody came up with a process to recrystalize M1 with some other, less expensive compound. If the compound is inactive, that would explain, why this new methylone is so much weaker. But the large crystals are so presentable that placebo effect kicks in and people believe that they are getting an awesome roll. I always roll to hard-style or to Bajofonda. When I hear this music in a totally sober state, I get the wave of euphoria - that&#039;s the power of suggestion! That&#039;s probably why people are &quot;jeezing in their pants&quot; as I read in reviews. The manufacturers probably sell this product to vendors at a lower cost, increasing their profit. And even though vendors sell it to customers at a lower cost than pure methylone, their margin is probably still higher, than with regular M1. And if the market is flooded with this new inferior&nbsp; product, it might be a trade-off they are willing to take to avoid going out their way in order to source the real thing. <br />It is, perhaps, a far-fetched theory, but how else would you explain that it took SexyWax 785mg to get a good roll?

				Fantastic times has returned 3/4 of the money I paid for his methylone. I would like to add that he was perfectly polite and attentive to me during our communication. Also while my order was for 5 grams, he has sent me 5.6 grams.&nbsp; I am very pleased with the way he conducts business and I would not hesitate to order from him again when he has the first rate methylone that I bought from him the first time. I am writing this on my own will because I believe in giving credit where it belongs.<br /><br />I have ordered trial quantities of M1 from two more vendors, who did not describe their methylone as large crystal or Moonrock.&nbsp; I will post here after I receive the samples and have a chance to research them.

				I bought M1 from FT a while ago when they were selling powder and the shit literally knocked my socks off! I dont know much about this new stuff. Hell, I don&#039;t even know why they switched it up....maybe bc it was powder <br />My current m1 comes straight from the lab (via a vendor here on sr). I don&#039;t really do it leisurely (so i can&#039;t really give an accurate assessment of my tolerance) but I do whenever I get a new batch in. I usually start feeling something 5 mins after taking it (crushed, orally). Usually .25-.30 gives me a pretty good roll. The key to using this stuff is...IF YOU MUST redose...it has to be within 30-45 mins of the original dose. Regardless of how &quot;high&quot; you think you feel, its best to redose during that window. <br />PS...I can&#039;t do more than .5 or it feels like my prostate is gonna explode lmao
