				I am sick of getting ripped of by FE&#039;ing for international orders. ALL international vendors for my drug of choice make FE&#039;ing compulsory.<br /><br />If we all refused to FE for a week starting on a given date, SR and vendors would surely suffer and realize our frustrations. Not saying we do that, but just think...<br /><br />Like &quot;alright, no one FE&#039;s, now what?&quot;.......ha ha<br /><br />Yet when we do FE and get scammed time and time again, SR always puts it back on us, the buyer, with responses like this one for example:<br />&quot;You need to take personal responsibility for your actions. We recommend in the Buyer&#039;s Guide, on the SR Wiki and in DPR&#039;s welcome message that buyers should always stay within escrow. If you choose to go against our recommendations that is your own choice, and you are the only one responsible for the consequences of your actions.&quot;<br /><br />So please bump the thread or comment and lets express our displeasure in this weakness of Silk Road&#039;s in hope they can think it through and come up with a solution.

				The easiest way to not fall victim to FE scams is to not finalize early.<br /><br />Vendors can choose how they do their business here, or else the road would probably be a lot less successful.<br /><br />As for my own personal opinion, I do think FE only vendors are dicks, and I do wish it never became a thing, however I don&#039;t think there should be a rule stating they can&#039;t require it. <br /><br />Instead of banning it, why not just discourage it? It may seem like a daunting task, but sooner or later vendors will understand without needing discouragement from others. <br /><br />If bringing in rules didn&#039;t tend to ruin things, I&#039;d be all for it, but if you think about it, more rules will likely equal less vendors.<br /><br />Just my two cents. Discouragement can be more powerful than enforcement if enough effort is given.
