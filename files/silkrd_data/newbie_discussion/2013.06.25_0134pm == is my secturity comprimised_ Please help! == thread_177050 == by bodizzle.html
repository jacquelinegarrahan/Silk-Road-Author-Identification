				Hey guys. So I use google chrome for regular public browsing but now the login name and password input bars on gmail and facebook are yellow. Before they were white. I feel sketched out about it and I cant seem to change them back to white. <br /><br />I did first find out about silk road in a public search on google obviously, but have done all other browsin on tor since then. Is my security compromised now because of that?<br /><br />Why are my damn Login and PW input bars for gmail and facebook yellow now!?!? Anyone have ideas?

				I don&#039;t know but it&#039;s super unlikely that it&#039;s related to your use of silkroad... You should google it.

				Typically this is due to a saved password which you have the option to bring up.<br /><br />It&#039;s good that you&#039;re being security minded but you may want to try to educate yourself on what is and isn&#039;t a attack.

				Thanks for the replies. I did try googling but came up with nothing.<br /><br />Cannabis, I have had my password option thing forever but it has never turned yellow. Just happened to do that randomly, all of the sudden. Hence my concern. Well hopefully its benign, but I will be using a different browser till I get it sorted out.<br /><br />

				I dont think your facebook or gmail will correlate with using tor

				Actually come to think of it, I did another search publicly (non tor) that involved trying to find the easy to use guide for silk road (yesterday). Do you guys think this red flagged me or something? Am I being paranoid?

				Even if it did flag you it wouldn&#039;t turn the sign in form yellow O.o That doesn&#039;t make any sense.

				Hey cannabis, thanks for that find.<br /><br />I guess that is what Im experiencing, its just so strange that it randomly popped up. Through reading that link you posted, their solutions involve using some manual reprogramming which I have *no* idea how to do..<br /><br />Even though I just read all that, I cant help but shake the sketchy feeling, arg (how it randomly popped up and was never there before, even though Ive always had autofill enabled..). But thanks cannabis!
