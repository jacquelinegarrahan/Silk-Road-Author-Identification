				Ok, I&#039;ve ordered from two pretty reputable MDMA vendors from across the pond and while my first transaction arrived, the subsequent two never did.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never received any love letters or notices in the mail and I was just wondering what other possibilities could have happened that may have caused the shipment to not arrive?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t rule out the possibility that the vendors are swamped and probably didn&#039;t ship when they said they did.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas as to what could have happened?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they were seized (or hope they weren&#039;t at least).

				Either the vendor never sent or the package got seized. I have read that sometimes they don&#039;t send a love letter when they seize a package so the recipient doesn&#039;t have it to show the vendor for a reship. I would look at the vendors feedback and then make a judgement. Or the love letter just hasn&#039;t made it to you yet.
