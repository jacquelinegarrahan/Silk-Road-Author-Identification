				you will find your bitcoin deposit address in your silk road profile/account.&nbsp; when you withdraw funds on mtgox using clearnet you paste in your bitcoin deposit address.&nbsp; tor is only used to access sr.&nbsp; dont access any clearnet sites (non onion url&#039;s) from tor browser.

				when you are using tor, or any vpn for that matter it is best not to access any clearnet site of importance that you have a login account on.&nbsp; sites such as amazon, your bank, paypal, mtgox, gmail etc. tend to notice the difference in vpn aspect and their security stuff flags your access as possibly being hacked.&nbsp; the basic idea is that if you are using vpn to hide ip you should also be hiding your identity.

				Mtgox will take about 5 days to get coins and requires identification. <br /><br />Easiest way to get coins into your wallet anonymously is to use bitinstant. It&#039;s my favorite method anyway. Go to u tube and search how to use bitinstant. Instead of depositing cash at CVS ( like the video suggests ) use Walmart. <br /><br />Take a few deep breaths and relax. Getting coins is confusing for everyone at first. There are a lot of different methods which is confusing to new people.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you access bank accounts or mtgox your accounts can get frozen. <br /><br />It&#039;s fine to use clearnet sites with tor. <br /><br />Again just relax. And good luck.

				Yea thats basic right. Tor is tor and you stay anonymous even on clearnet. If you want to stay as anonymous for Facebook for example then don&#039;t use your current account. Create a new one. Then you can&#039;t even be tracked easily from Facebook. That&#039;s why a lot of forums block access from tor exit nodes. Cause it is just about impossible to track scamers and spamers back to there ip through tor. So they just block all known tor exit nodes. <br /><br />
