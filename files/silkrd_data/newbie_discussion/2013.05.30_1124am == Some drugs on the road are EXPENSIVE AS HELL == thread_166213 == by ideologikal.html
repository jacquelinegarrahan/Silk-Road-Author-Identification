				So after being around here for a few months now... I&#039;ve noticed there are some big price differences from what I see locally (not on SR). Great quality/priced psychedelics, rolls, ganj.<br /><br />But cocaine ~ $180 a gram?!?<br />and adderall, by far the worst offender here, at $1 A MG? It would be much easier and wiser to go convince a psychiatrist you needed them before EVER paying that outrageous price.<br /><br />In my area quality yak goes for around $80... adderall 30 mg are $5 each.

				They are my friend...sorry but what is offered is perhaps rather better quality than on the street,...I know mine is as good as it gets (direct from the transport from Peru and Columbia...period...nothing else) and that kind of quality costs.<br /><br />Though I urge to consider &quot;value&quot; over price...with high quality comes better high, less product needed...etc etc...<br /><br />I guess from some of us, you are buying the Rolls Royce :)<br /><br />Cheers though<br /><br />Doc

				I did last week - not doing any more this week as I have a lot going out of the door right now so demand is high...I have small amounts listed and they&#039;re rather good, so would urge you to have a go...<br /><br />I may do some more samples next week but at the moment it&#039;s pretty popular so not for the time being.<br /><br />Cheers though...appreciate your message<br /><br />Doc
