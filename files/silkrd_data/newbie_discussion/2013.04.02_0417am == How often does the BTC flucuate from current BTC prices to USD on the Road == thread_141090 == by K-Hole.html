				Hey everyone sorry if this has been asked before a million times but I checked the Wiki and cannot find anything and read the SR info thingy,,, <br /><br />BUT how often is the the BTC prices change to the current rates from MT. Gox to SR? Basically if the price of BTC rises the prices of BTC on silk road for something goes down and if it goes down in price per BTC the product costs more BTC...<br /><br />I just want to know when the prices fluctuates on the coins prices on the road ?? <br /><br />THANKS A BUNCH , I wanna know before I buy something since its fucking 105$ a BTC! and I want to make sure I get the right price cause if it has not ben updated and I pay more then it goes down two minutes later the coin price on the Road goes down I will be more than pissed lol

				The vast majority of sellers peg their prices to USD. So you are paying the same amount regardless of what the current BTC rate is. The only way the actual price changes is if the vendor changes it.

				i understand that but if the current price in BTC for 100$ lets say is not updated on the road and the price changes but the coin on the vendors page has not then you will pay higher BTC for that product since the coin is worth more,, If the price for the BTC goes to 200$ then your paying the BTC amount for when it was 100$ (so the BTC rate you pay will be higher on the vendors page until it is lowered because the rate of the BTC went up so before it is updated you will pay double the current BTC rate to equal that 100$ if it doubled like that)<br /><br />The cost you pay in BTC is pegged to the USD sought by the seller but as prices goes up or down the price you pay to equal the pegged price by the vendor fluctuates to the current rate of the BTC to equal their asking price,,,,,<br /><br />Hope that makes since
