				Get your money back? Getting out of hand? LOLOL<br /><br />I am sorry but the silk road doesn&#039;t need to do anything for morons such as you guys. Silk road can&#039;t help all the stupid people who decide to FE. This isn&#039;t a scam, you gave your money to some random seller without receiving your product. You blatantly disregarded the escrow system in place and made a purely STUPID decision. So why don&#039;t you OWN UP to that stupid decision and stop whining and crying to SR when it doesn&#039;t work out? Stop wasting their time. And while you&#039;re at it stop FEing for ANYONE because that is what drives these scammers to keep coming back, idiots like you. You have the power to fix this more than anyone else; no one else is stupid enough to FE. The BIGGEST red flag someone is scamming is requesting to FE, there is NO BIGGER MORE OBVIOUS SIGN, NONE.<br /><br />You honestly need them to completely disable buyer&#039;s ability to release funds so your dumb ass won&#039;t go in there and do it? How would that work exactly, how can SR do anything? You want SR to release the funds for you? What is the difference?<br /><br />Too much sympathy for these &#039;victims&#039; of their own stupidity...the scams will go away once you stop FEing moron, the silk road has doe something about it, it&#039;s called escrow, you CHOSE to ignore it. <br />

				Even legit vendors go rogue. Very few of the original vendors from when this place started are still around. He easily could have run a legitimate business for 7 months and gotten all those 5/5 reviews, but decided that its time to drop this game before he gets caught. An honest person would just close up shop, but it should come as no surprise many vendors just rip off their last customers when they decide its time to quit.<br /><br />Escrow is your friend. And even with escrow you still shouldn&#039;t be spending money you can&#039;t afford to lose here.

				Maybe what you need is someone to be an asshole instead of holding your hand.<br /><br />Yes I know some sellers require FE, and like I just said if they do, DON&#039;T use them. Simply as that.<br /><br />Or FE if you must, but at the very least have the brains to realize the risk your taking, don&#039;t expect anything in return, and please stop posting about it. Learn to understand the risk you are taking instead of expecting other people to resolve your issue. SR has escrow. They advise to use it. Why is it THEIR problem YOU can&#039;t understand why?<br /><br />Less sellers would ask for FE, and less scamming if people would stop FEing. Only those actually FEing for sellers can fix that. I don&#039;t care about how long they have been here, successful transactions...etc. Scamming is much more profitable doing it with built trust. Problem is SOME people trust sellers too much for stupid reasons and can&#039;t seem to use their own senses. SR should not be responsible for this, they would be busy with morons all day long.

Have you really thought about how that would work? It wouldn&#039;t. Please tell me how you&#039;d implement such a system as no FE allowed but sellers get paid in a timely manner? At some point you have to pay the seller. That is a responsibility of the buyer. Sellers would try to exploit any system/buyer in place to get funds before shipment, and the SR admins should not have to take on the responsibility of releasing people&#039;s funds FOR THEM. Point is ultimately the buyer has control of the funds and just needs to be smart about it. No amount of laws, rules or systems in place will 100% prevent stupid decisions and stupid people.<br /><br />Would you have funds sent to sr admins who hold it until you tell them to release funds? How is this different than escrow? Would you not let the sellers have their funds until two weeks later? And who is to say the package did not get there? What effects might this have on sellers even wanting to sell here getting their funds later? That would take a lot of SR admins babysitting every situation and transaction. SO please tell me how would you take away FE???? How would you implement this to be 100% stupid-proof? Do tell.<br /><br />FEing isn&#039;t the problem, escrow works perfectly; butt here is no fix for stupidity.<br /><br />This site makes plenty from quality transactions through escrow. The silk road would be fine without all these newbies doing dumb shit. Hell the site even might run smoother. You know what I see in 20 years if SR holds all these newbies hands and &#039;protects&#039; them? I see more scamming with all this FEing theses newbs are doing giving these scammers a profit, diluting the seller pool and site in general and I see surplus in time spent dealing with their dumb ass problems and situations that really only they, themselves can fix.<br /><br />

				It sucks to lose that much cash but honestly you both fucked up hard, and now you&#039;re acting like complete fucking babies about it.<br /><br />There are plenty of ways to maintain perfect feedback over a long period of time.&nbsp; First of all, you don&#039;t need to be actively selling anything for an account to appear active; Binxster may have registered the account 7 months ago, but only had any listings up for the past month.&nbsp; Second, since this is an ANONYMOUS drug forum, there is nothing to stop them from purchasing their own listings and leaving positive feedback.&nbsp; Contrary to what you believe, there have been some high profile weed scammers on SR recently that have done exactly this, and made off quite well.&nbsp; Third, they could have performed a &#039;selective scam&#039;, where product was sent out only to certain users, possibly only those ordering small amounts (or Binxster may have only listed small amounts prior to posting scam bulk listings).<br /><br />In fact, now that I actually look at Binxsters profile page, his first feedback is from only a month ago!&nbsp; Surprise surprise!&nbsp; Even more suspiciously at least the first 100 purchases (I stopped counting) were for the exact same QP listing, and all the feedback looks nearly identical (notice how the first letter of every single feedback is capitalized)!&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only would it be extremely odd for a vendor to sell 100 QPs right off the bat, but no one would in their right mind would FE on a QP with no prior feedback to go off of.&nbsp; Also, clearly neither of you searched his name on the forums, because if you had, you&#039;d realize that nothing comes up!&nbsp; He wasn&#039;t even a good fucking scammer, but already you two single-handedly made the whole endeavor worth his time.&nbsp; Congratulations.<br /><br />Your money is long gone, and no marrymemetal is almost definitely not the guy who scammed you, he is just trying to knock some sense into you.
