				What is the consensus on this? Im soon going through with my first order, and I trust tor/silk road is secure, but I still feel apprehensive about using real name/address. <br /><br />Have other guys on here done that?

				Every time. Just encrypt it with the seller&#039;s public PGP key and paste the encrypted message in the box on the checkout page on the SR site.

				Well from the sounds of it you have a lot a researching to do on the forums. Yes, it&#039;s okay to use your real name and address to order off of Silk Road. BUT, please make sure you read the buyers guide and research everything you possibly can before you order anything. GPG is the key with using your real info.

				It depends it is very 50/50 on here on who uses there personal address and who has drop addresses everyone is completely different. Where are you based UK/USA/EU etc??<br /><br />I am UK based and personally dont use my own name/address as I&#039;m very paranoid due to personal/work life finding out.

				Either use your real name and address and have your entire house clean and PC encrypted with plausible deniability or go all out and get a drop with a fake name. I have done both and never ran into problems but no matter what you do there is a small chance things can go wrong. Be prepared and understand the consequences before you do anything.

				If I were use say (i know this might sound silly) but just my first initial and full last name, would that be sketchy? Or say &quot;Mr. so and so&quot;<br /><br />Lol, I know it sounds like kind of silly question, but wondering if this would serve any positive purpose?
