				Hey all newbie here, so far i&#039;ve spent a few hours scouring the board and web for information on the best practice to go about my business on here. But i&#039;m just about to buy some BTC and was wondering if it was a bad move to use a 3rd party site (it is a highly trusted one) and pay it via direct bank transfer.<br />Is this a bad idea as there be a trail on my bank statement to the BTC exchange company. Now i know it&#039;s not illegal to actually buy BTC but if i somehow do find myself in front of the LE, this will possible feed their suspicions?<br /><br />All thoughts appreciated.

				I&#039;m pretty sure they need a warrant to check your bank records, if you&#039;re just buying personal amounts it&#039;s doubtful that they&#039;ll ever get a warrant to do so.

				So your saying it would be wiser to withdraw cash and deposit in person at a local branch to 3rd party BTC exchanger?

				Why take a chance? Yeah, unlikely to be traced but an anonymous over the counter cash deposit is peace of mind for a bit of effort IMO.

				I&#039;m also in a similar situation, but just searched &amp; found someone locally selling bitcoins at a decent rate. Would I be better off getting them locally, or going through a site that links your bank account &amp; goes through a transfer? Any help is appreciated! Thank you :)

				Personal opinion but if you start being lazy on certain security risks (for example using bank account) it may become a habbit and cause you to be less secure in your future actions. Just my advice.

				Peace of Mind. Nothing can buy that. Especially for us newbies who will be shitting ourselves during the first few orders.
