				I have reason to believe I have a warrant out for my arrest. I was wondering if I bought a fake ID off SR would a cop be able to tell if I got pulled over or some shit? Can the proper info be programmed into the ID? <br />Thanks

				LOL<br /><br />When they run it they will know it is fake.&nbsp; We have these technologies called internet and databases and law enforcement utilizes them.

				Never give fake ID to a cop, even if you used real info of someone else, they can still pull up your picture from the DMV, I don&#039;t know if this works for out of state ID&#039;s but my guess is they probably do have access to out of state DMV pics. We are in a technological age, you can&#039;t get away with shit like that anymore.

				You need to have a data jammer in your back bumper that can be activated with a switch on the dash.&nbsp; the cellular data jammer will jam his laptop from accessing the real pic.&nbsp; As long as the info checks out and you have the ssn memorized, you will be good.&nbsp; He must believe it to be a real person though.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to jam his radio signal.&nbsp; All will be good if he thinks that it really is you.&nbsp; trust me, find an expert and they can help you.&nbsp; the best bet is to try to work out the warrant, otherwise find someone that can install a jammer and knows some stuff about electronics and fake ids.

				Even if the fake was perfect, and it will not be, you would need to use real information because the cops have access to databases and will look you up.<br /><br />Unless all the info on the fake is real and the person&#039;s whose identity you are taking has the same height, eye color, skin color etc you will be busted. And they will get you not just for your warrant, but having fake ID and identity theft,<br /><br />Better to not have ID on you, they will only get you if they fingerprint you or know you.

				Yes the info would have to match a real person, but that isn&#039;t hard to obtain, I typically pay off associates that work in hr for companies as they make me extra copies of ids when doing new hires.&nbsp; There are tons of ways to do this.&nbsp; ideally find an id for a state out west that has a very low population density, the cops don&#039;t know every feature of every id off hand.&nbsp; i&#039;ve seen fakes pass through cops hands many times without them realizing it.&nbsp; the National Driver register is maintained by the fbi in the us and brings together data from every state.&nbsp; Best idea is pretend that you are amish and never had an id or social card,&nbsp; the amish have special circumstances and no documents when they join the general society and leave the amish community.&nbsp; use this loophole and obtain an id as a new person.&nbsp; set this up ahead of time and you can have a backup or two or three if something goes wrong.&nbsp; you can also modify dmv data if you know someone inside or know a really good hacker.&nbsp; if you can use the amish plan in a state at a small town dmv office you can get the new data uploaded by them to the fbi and then to the national database.&nbsp; Dont have more than two ids in one state and for each legal identity change as much as possible of your face like beard and glasses to throw off their junk facial recognition.&nbsp; do it soon as this technology is rapidly changing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing all of this for years and one of my identities is in the criminal system with felonies from when i was young but the others are clean.&nbsp; i have accomplished everything people said that i couldn&#039;t.&nbsp; however the best plan is to work out the legal issues and get rid of the warrants.&nbsp; changing your fingerprints with acid and razor blades is horrible.

				To buy a new identity that actually checks out will cost you mega bucks.<br /><br />Get a lawyer instead and deal with whatever your warrant is about.
