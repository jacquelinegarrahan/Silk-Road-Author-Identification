				Having demolished a sheet of acid in the last 8 months or so, I have found myself with 0.69 bitcoins. What should I buy now? <br /><br />Background:<br />I&#039;m looking to try something new.<br />Have tried: LSD (up to around 800ug), MDMA, MDAI, Cannabis, 2CB (to dangerously high doses), AMT (to very dangerously high doses), ketamine (1-2g a day habit for a while,ended in short-term psychosis).<br /><br />LSD by far my favourite drug, feel it is more profound than other drugs I have tried (had a messianic type ketamine psychosis for a month or so which seemed very profound at the time, but I&#039;m not keen to blast myself that far out there again at this point in time). Liked MDMA a lot in the past, but compared with LSD it has a feeling of artificiality to it I find, and am really looking for something more introspective I think. Basically am in a kind of apathetic/indecisive funk and looking for something that might force me into a confrontation with myself, show me what it is that I want/desire, help me settle some indecision. Understand that drugs don&#039;t solve problems necessarily, but looking for a helping hand.<br /><br />So here&#039;s a shortlist, open to other suggestions. Looking for something new, as I keep getting the same sort of results on my LSD trips. (I have this kinda recurring trip going on. I had one really out there trip a while back around a time when I had to make an important decision&nbsp; - I was running about all over the place apparently, thinking it was the end of the world, basically not lucid at the time. Was weird as this was not a particularly high dose trip compared to others and this hasn&#039;t happened to me any other time. Basically all my trips since then have seemed to relate back to that one in some way. So it&#039;s like that one was a sort of vision of the future and then every trip since then is me actually living the future I had predicted, slowly marching towards the end of the world/judgment day kind of thing. Although to complicate matters it was like I was choosing one of two futures at that time - I basically had two girls in my life (and not through being a sleazy two-timer before that comes up), either of which I felt I could spend the rest of my life with but had to choose one, felt like I was determining the rest of my life at this time.)<br /><br />So yeah, for those who are still with me, what drug might be useful to get myself out of a recurring trip situation on LSD? And help me either be more comfortable with the decision I have made, or show me that I have for sure made the wrong one? And bearing in mind I had a messianic break on ketamine, perhaps I should avoid anything that is too heavy going (or perhaps not?) And yeah I get that these things might not be possible, but what would you recommend for someone trying to find out this kind of stuff?

				That&#039;s kinda the answer I was expecting/dreading. I guess the worries are<br /><br />1.) It doesn&#039;t last that long, so maybe I&#039;d go back down the road I went with ketamine (short-acting, no comedown, so you can basically take it several times a day and still kinda function a bit while going more and more out there)<br /><br />2.) It&#039;s super powerful so sends me really far out there again and I can&#039;t make my way back for carrying on with my life as it is which I sort of alright with atm.<br /><br />But maybe the answer is that I need to stop being such a pussy and take the shot out of a cannon approach rather than trying to feel my way around other psychedelic headspaces?

				I don&#039;t know, I had fun with dmt for a short while and when I realized the cost was almost becoming an issue, I put it down no problem. When I have some extra cash in a month or so I will pick some more up.

				from a mind explorers perspective, you should definitely try DMT. It takes off where acid left you. If you like acid, you will love DMT. <br />try to take it alone, it is not a community drug. If doing it with others, make them shut up completely until you finished your closed eye visuals, which is rather quick (5-10mins). vape it, lay your vapaoriser somewhere save, close your eyes, let the sun penetrate your eyelids and enjoy it. it raises body temperature somewhat and is rather sticky to the lungs, so breath actively- from there on, there is just salvia that takes your mind further.<br /><br />from a market observers perspective, I would get some mescaline as its rare and right now, available, whereas DMT appears to be widely available. it, too, is very enjoyable and on a plus side, IT IS a community drug, in direct comparison to DMT.<br /><br />shrooms wont give you anything you have not experienced on acid, but they, too, can be a very nice trip. Also, availability suggests you should be able to acquire them anytime. thanks to all the mycologists.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont think mescaline or DMT will make you addicted to them as they are too intense for my linking to redose often, but I am not the kind of guy who gets addcted easily anymore, but have been, so it is easy for me to say. have been on shrooms a long time without a break, so they tend to form a habit.<br /><br />If you have done all of the above, msg me and I will hook you up with rare tryptamines, not only the ones in my listings :)

				I got to try mescaline one time, not that long after a &quot;bad&quot; &#039;shroom/alcohol trip, and it helped me to heal from it.&nbsp; It also helped me to not want to drink for a while, afterward.&nbsp; Maybe it could help you, too.

				Shrooms!&nbsp; They go take a strole through your local wildlife area. Unless it&#039;s hunting season I suspect hearing gunshots would be messed up while tripping.

				this is all imho and from experience<br /><br />mushrooms can be very kind but you have to be really be able to accept all your emotions. the whole spectrum. because if the shrooms release emotions you aren&#039;t prepared to accept then you will create emotional resistance against a power greater than you which you have introduced into your being. what you resist persists. and it may well kick your ass.<br /><br />other than that, a beautiful 3 - 5 hour experience outside of time in a rainbow wonderland. healing for the soul for those who accept it.<br /><br /><br />mescaline is a slightly different beast. at +t3 on shrooms, you will be tripping your face off. at +t3 on mescaline, you will only just be coming up. buckle up bitch. you are in for a potential 12 hour ride of lattice patterns and very strange and deep visions of what I can only describe as your soul.<br /><br />again, be prepared to accept what you are shown. it can change your life if you commit to it.<br /><br /><br />dmt. how do i describe this to others? <br /><br />if you ever have any doubt concerning there being intelligent life outside of what you see with your eyes. dmt will silence those instantly with a breakthrough experience.<br /><br />it can be a bit of a strange one. you have to melt and vape it to get the active fumes inside you. unlike burning it.<br /><br />small doses can be kinda uncomfortable with a nasty body-load.<br /><br />but push it further and that body load turns kinda warm on your chest. the rainbows. chrysanthemums. the joy.<br /><br />going beyond that. well, you know the rumors. :-)<br /><br />bear in mind, it is one of those substances&nbsp; that you have to consume within a certain timeframe. you literally have 60 - 90+ seconds to get as much of the dmt into you as you can. after that, you will not be able to absorb any more.<br /><br />changa is perhaps a good alternative. it contains harmalines (iirc) along with the dmt to allow the whole experience to glide much more smoothly. you can pace the experience then much like pacing a bong session.<br /><br /><br />the choice is yours. my vote? mescaline.

				The only one of these I&#039;ve done is mushrooms. In the spirit of adventure I would probably do the mescaline. If it wasn&#039;t so expensive, and if there was a domestic vendor, I would have ordered a couple grams already. <br /><br />As someone wrote, it&#039;s a potential social drug, and I prefer that over the solitary stuff.
