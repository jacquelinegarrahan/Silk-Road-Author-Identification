				Never bought bud from SR before, dirt cheap and great qual IRL IMO id love to see an exotic dealer come on though with HQ pics and like wide selection of strains. <br /><br />I am not sure who is good though, try searching in the search bar for threads that already exist that might answer your question.<br /><br />-JOS

				If you don&#039;t live in America, Leaf sells some great pre-rolled joints for some really good prices given the weight and strains. New vendor, but super nice and reliably responsive.

				We&#039;ve got some fantastic medical grade stuff (listings will be up later tonight) at competitive prices but if you&#039;d like to go with somebody who&#039;s been here longer I&#039;ve had great experiences with brutusk, humboldtsfinest, and retinablast in the past (before I became a vendor/moved to the west coast). :)

				go with farmer1 or gaiagarden.. you&#039;ll get excellent weed/concentrates for an excellent price and they&#039;re both growers who are very passionate about what they do<br /><br />there&#039;s a lot of bullshit overhyped &quot;medical&quot; on here that costs like 340/oz, don&#039;t fall for it..&nbsp; if you&#039;re willing to pay a little premium, try out ogbryan.&nbsp; killer dank for sure also (another grower as well)

It can also depend on how often you receive packages. A few times a month from a decent vendor using that level of stealth would easily fly under the radar. But several times a week for an extended amount of time may raise some flags.

I also don&#039;t planning on ordering from SR more than every 2 weeks or so. I feel safe...but just to confirm for 1 last time. This vendor&#039;s (CannabisCrew) shipping policy - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5bfac154ce ,it&#039;s pretty much as good as it gets I&#039;m assuming?

				Their shipping policy seems completely legit. Although I wouldn&#039;t recommend doing the FE that they&#039;re requesting at the moment. <br /><br />They seem to have decent reviews for their shipping methods by reputable forum users in their Rumor Mill thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142874.0

				like the person above said, don&#039;t FE altho it only looks like they were requiring that while SR was down, use your real name and address, and it will be delivered.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never not received a domestic package (except from a star trek fan site lol) and i had fam from the coast sending me weed before i ever used SR.&nbsp; with mylar bags becoming the new standard, and with many established vendors having some pretty amazing and very creative stealth, i don&#039;t think you need to worry..&nbsp; <br /><br />just put yr order in, kick back and forget about it for a couple days.. next thing ya know, boom, u got male bro
