				same here, ordered last Saturday and it still says processing.<br /><br />I know the road has been down but I have been accessing fine for the past few days. I assumed that he would have caught up with the backlog by now....<br /><br />NOOB questions:<br /><br />if it still says processing in 2 days time am I able to cancel the order and get a full refund? And if I do, will I be refunded the bitcoins that I spent on the order or their doller value in bitcoins? Because the value has dropped massively this week so I stand to lost about 1/3rd of the value of my order if I get a straight refund...<br /><br />Fingers crossed he will dispatch soon

				Am still waiting here, though it&#039;s not a big deal yet, but it worried me a bit seeing he has no active listings as of now... Any news you guys got about your orders? <br /><br />My order is small and I dont want to be a nuisance to him, I guess the guy&#039;s just busy so I did not message myself... yet!

				I PMed him 2 days or 3 ago&nbsp; and still no reply<br />I didn&#039;t have orders with him yet but was going to because there is exactly the same situation with my vendor TN,- order is pending for 6 days<br />(In my PM i was asking if i could place order with him and not to FE)<br />Is theXchange&#039;s stuff good? Does anyone know? Is he a reliable vendor?<br />

				All ive heard from x man is good things so im a little baffled to why he might not be responding to anyone. Today I cancelled my order as i cant wait any longer.&nbsp; Has anyone noticed that C is drying up from good UK vendors? maybe that has had an effect on his business. I was thinking that because BTC was high before the ddos attack that he would of lost to much money from the drop in BTC.another reason is maybe he has been busted which would not be cool as the police would have all are personal details and might have are addresses flagged.<br />Remember this is pure speculation and should not be worried about.I just wish that X man would reply to someone to put everyones minds at rest.

				I don&#039;t think that BTC rate can cause problems for vendors as all prices pined to dollar and all vendors&#039; wallets have auto withdrawal facility after payment been done to their btc wallet,- to transfer them into dollars or whatever currency they want, but why don&#039;t they post info on their vendor&#039;s page about what the hell is going on and what are the problems, etc!!!!

				<br />I would guess he is having problems but will surely return, you don&#039;t give out as many samples as he has without staying around to recoup his investment.<br />I have had his new batch of Coke twice and it is very good , his Heroin&nbsp; is better than most I have had off SR it is nice No3 smokes great and bangs up ok with plenty of citric to break it down.<br />C
