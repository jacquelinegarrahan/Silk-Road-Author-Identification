				So I got some E on here a week or so ago. I&#039;ve had it before, but this was my first time rollin solo. Now I&#039;m a musician of sorts, studying piano at uni.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve got a good roll going and I decide to sit down and try to play through a piece I have been working on.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been held up on some of the technical aspects of it, AND I know from experience that nearly all chemicals hinder my ability to perform at a high level(creativity is often enhanced though).&nbsp; But the opposite happened.&nbsp; It was as if my fingers were responding with accuracy that I have never experienced before!&nbsp; I was able to dedicate my brain to shaping the phrases musically while my fingers played the notes without effort.&nbsp; It was such an awesome experience.<br /><br />So has anyone experienced anything like this?&nbsp; Was this maybe just a fluke?<br />If you play an instrument, drop some E and play. See what happens!&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;m like this with my decks, feel like I&#039;ve mastered the dj art while I&#039;m rolling but in reality probably just look like a retard pressing buttons and swaying back and forward

				I don&#039;t know much about E, but LSD boosts my guitar skill quite a few notches. If I ever try E I&#039;ll give it a go!
