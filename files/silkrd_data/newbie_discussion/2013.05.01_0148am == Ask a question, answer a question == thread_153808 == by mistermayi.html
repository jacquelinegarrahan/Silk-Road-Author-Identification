				First purchase was some special K, it was awesome!<br /><br />I drool over the MDMA and cocaine from around Europe but am still kinda iffy about making a serious order because I happen to live in a certain country who&#039;s customs is apparently very skilled. and from what I see on here there seems to be a lot of scammers from my home country so we are in turn often the targets of selective scammers... sigh.

My first purchase? Whooh.... Uh........................ Ah! I remember. I got 10 hits of 25C and 10 hits of 25I. I didn&#039;t know how they were different so I tested each. Realized 25C was a poor excuse of a drug and found out 25I was a hell of a drug, and then moved from there.<br /><br />Heard about The Road from the Internet (whispers here and there). Investigated. Was crazy impressed by the security. Visited a few times. Lurked for a while. Went in, made a purchase. Familiarized myself. Year or so later, here we are.
