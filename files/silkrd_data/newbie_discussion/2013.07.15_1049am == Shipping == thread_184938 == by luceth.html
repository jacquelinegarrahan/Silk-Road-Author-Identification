				Hi, I&#039;m interested in becoming a vendor, but I have some questions about bulk shipping first.<br /><br />How can one ship a few pounds of weed discretely? Is it even possible? Or a few pounds of any substance for that matter.

				A few POUNDS?&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much about the vendor angle, but I can&#039;t see any reason to send pounds of drugs in the mail.&nbsp; Anyone buying that much is obviously going into business for themselves, not purchasing for personal use.<br /><br />Sending that much in the mail is really, really risky, and the penalties, if you&#039;re caught, will be severe.&nbsp; Personally, I would never put myself at such risk, just to help someone else set up shop for themselves.<br /><br />If they need a few pounds of weed or coke or whatever to start their business, let them look for local suppliers in their area.<br /><br />Again, I don&#039;t know much about the vendor angle, but I would assume &quot;bulk shipping&quot; means a few ounces or so.&nbsp; Not a few pounds.

				Alright, thanks man. I wasn&#039;t sure if it made more sense to just ship an entire harvest at once, if possible, rather than many small orders. I assumed it would be impractical :)

				There are tons of bulk listings on the road of multiple pounds and even kilos. Yes there are ways to ship it and no it&#039;s not uncommon. Red Rover is talking completely out of his ass. Research the correct methods and good luck!
