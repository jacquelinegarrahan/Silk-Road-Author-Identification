				Hey,<br /><br />This is for all the newbie&#039;s and to those who are still learning how to fly.<br /><br />Please stop getting over excited when your product arrives and leaving over exaggerated and inaccurate reviews of your product either on feedback or on here.<br /><br />I know this is easy done especially if your high at the time,&nbsp; what I would advise is leave it a few days say a week tops before leaving your reviews or feedback as usually once the initial excitement is over you will feel a lot different and if not then great go ahead with what you would have put at the start.<br /><br />There has been plenty of weed/hash over the past few months that I have bought that is nothing like the feedback, I know these days not to really trust it, usually you can pick out the ones to take note of and who knows maybe its fake feedback here also but I bet there is a fair few of you guys out there that are just getting carried away with everything and going over the top.<br /><br />You know who you are :)<br /><br />Many Thanks<br />

				Giving FEEDBACK<br /><br />1. Describe the appearance of the product. Compressed, fluffy? Tasty? Smelly? Crunchy?<br />2. Describe (vaguely) how well it was secured. Stealth? Smells? Double vac-ed?<br />3. Get high as fuck, but write the review the following day--when you&#039;re sober.<br />4. Give more than 10 words. People are concerned about fake feedback. Think Amazon: share a detailed and thoughtful account of your product. Do you recommend it to other newbs? To a friend? etc....

				Great post,<br />I would also add, please don&#039;t bother leaving review saying &quot;FE early for trusted vendor, will update&quot; because that means we just have to scroll through lots of pages of that shit when we want to see some decent reviews. Take a little sample of the product and then leave your review, that&#039;s best for everyone.
