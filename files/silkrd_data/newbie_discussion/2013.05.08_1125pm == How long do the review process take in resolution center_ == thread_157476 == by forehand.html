				Hi!<br /><br />Ive been a SR user for something like 2,5 months and done + 20 deals. Domestic and international from different countries and no hassle or problems with any vendors or deliveries. One time i was a bit anxious when i had placed two things from the same vendor in the UK and a letter arrived with only one of the two orders. It wasn until another week had passed with regular contact with the seller during, that it arrived and it actually was sent at the same time. Not until i placed a domestic order did i get in touch with the stinking filthy sings of being ripped off. Thank God for escrow. Now itś in review and i feel that it would be hard to argue the vendors point with others having gotten the same treatment before this and later too. <br /><br />My question is, how long does it take for the res. center to review the case and decide? It been there a few days now. If anyone knows about or has experience of it&nbsp; iĺl be glad to hear about it. <br /><br />Forehand

There is a backlog due to the recent site issues, but rest assured it will be seen and processed - you won&#039;t be left out in the cold on it.<br /><br />+1 for staying in escrow. :)<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks for your reply! I understand how the process is done and that there is a lot to catch up on with regarad to recent event. I was just hoping for a current ballpark estimate with this in mind, are we talking a few more days or a few weeks. Somethjing like that. I understand that itś difficult to give an exact answer, but i thought if i throw it out there maybe iĺl get a little wiser. Thanks again mate. <br /><br />

				Hi again!<br /><br />Sorry for asking again but i+m just trying to learn. <br /><br />The order has actually been reviewed for more than week today. It was due to be resolved by 6th of may. My question today is wether this is something i should bring up with staff? If only to ask for an estimated time until itś resolved. <br /><br />Im sure that it will be handled eventually but since itś quite an amount involved my btc-ordering is dependent on if this is resolved or not. You probably know what i mean. <br /><br />Any reply would be appreciated.

Itś good enough though and iḿ gonna stop counting on it being resolved and instead see it as a potential nice suprise when it gets resolved. Iḿ counting on getting a full refund here but iḿ not sure how the judgement is done but i feel that the actual &quot;evidence&quot; all point in my favour. The vendor had some old accusations of scamming occasionally but pages full of perfect feedback inbetween and i was reassured that the latest 10-15 orders or so were very quick and no problems so i placed it. <br /><br />My order was sent a little too quickly (in the morning after an hour of ordering) but never arrived. I was very cool first in my communications, giving them a chance to save face and send it even though they already &quot;shipped&quot; it in SR. But no response and by then i had serious concerns. At the same time several other buyers had left new feedback regarding the same thing and someone even had theirs resolved fully by then. No answers to any communications from me and i took it to res-center and one line of text from the seller was the only communication i have ever seen from them about this, last day before it was due. <br />It was that others had got their shipments. Obviously this was true, but the contrary also happened to others. It actually isnt saying that they actually sent it, either. <br /><br />Their vendning also stopped because of some strange issue but would return by a specified date 2-4 days ahead. This was like a month ago and still not vendning openly (gets feedback without listings)&nbsp; and more scam-alerts have showed up. My stats are 0 auto-finalize and 0 resolved. I always pay as soon as it arrives and i take pride in not being a scammer and that pisses me off, that they are implying that on me. If they had been given me a reasonable explanation and made me secure in that they had done their part then i might even have accepted it if i was reimbursed the next order or something (too much money to just give away) but by ignoring me until the last day before its due in res.center saying i will get 0 % is just not believable to me i would have been raided by now if it was intercepted, and its domestic! All other orders have worked just fine afterwards (and before).&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Bdylan: Do you communicate in english and are your vendors communication in english? Some of the communications in my case is in a european language and i suppose if they want that evaluated they need to understand it properly which i suppose they cant qucikstep over it. <br /><br />Sorry for the long post. Some nights afterhours i just can seem to sleep and tend to make long posts. It might be the hard drugs, or the coffee i drank black last week.&nbsp; &nbsp;???

				Hi again!<br /><br />Thanks for the links. <br /><br />A little bump on this subject. <br />The order was resolved as a 100% refund to me a few days after our last posts here.<br />There were many feedbacks giving the same comments about no communication, no orders recieved etc just as me coming in at the same time so i suppose admins had a to take care of alot of their &quot;customers&quot; orders.<br /><br />The part that disturbs me somewhat is that the vendor is still around and now also is listing the exact same products all over again. They even posted an almost silly declaration of what happened with the resolved orders and also that they were disappointed that people still gave them 1/5 in feedback even thought they had recieceved their refunds (wtf!). I suppose that they try to imply that they willingly paid out refunds but only one customer is saying anything about this among the feedbacks given (80% refund), all others are just like mine. <br /><br />They continue to say their review score (+80 at the time) is proof that they still are a good and reliable gang of guys, it obviously hasn dawned on them that this wouldn&#039;t last very long, which it didnt. They coast ahead with a respectable (60) which is the worst i&#039;ve seen so far. <br /><br />Peace!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				How about telling us which vendor you&#039;re talking about? Part of the point of the forums is so that, when vendors do this, and now have the same products up, we can communicate about it and be warned.&nbsp; Not that most people are (hopefully) buying from a vendor with a rating of 60, but still, name names.
