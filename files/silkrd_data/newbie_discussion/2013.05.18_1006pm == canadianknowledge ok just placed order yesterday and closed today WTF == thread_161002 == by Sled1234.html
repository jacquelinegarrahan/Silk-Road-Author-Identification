If you did FE, then there is nothing that Silk Road can do to help you in this instance.<br /><br />Libertas

				Incidents like this ruin FE&#039;ing for even trusted vendors. When we say not to FE it means NEVER FE, take your business elsewhere!

				Sled1234 im in the same boat as you. He got me for a pound worth bitcoin.<br />Really regretting FE, Funny enough the lad even messaged me 2days ago,&#039;Thanks for your order. We are not out to scam so ease be rest assured we are not out to create problems for you&#039;. Well my problem now is a hole in my pocket.<br />What you going to do but learn from our mistakes, I do agree with some vendors that do ask for FE, to keep there<br />own product coming in. If there was no money, there wouldnt be any greed.<br />The reason i hit the FE, was driven by greed, because of the price and the money i would make,<br />guess my greed made me poorer.
