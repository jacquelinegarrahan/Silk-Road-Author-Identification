				I know there are a few threads about KC but I was wondering if there were any new reports?&nbsp; <br /><br />Placed an order last Tuesday 1/15 with NEXT day shipping..Friday it was markedin transit and since it is Wednesday 1/23 now and the mail already came I am assuming that it still has not shipped...<br /><br />The thing is I contacted KC before ordering and let them know that I needed it by last Thursday 1/17 since we were going away..he said he would &quot;Try&quot; and get it here...When I didn&#039;t receive the order on Thursday we pushed back our plans until Saturday.&nbsp; He said he would again &quot;Try&quot; to get it here by Saturday...nothing showed..<br /><br />Since he marked it in Transit on Friday 1/18 it can&#039;t be canceled now...obviously all I can do is wait now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now he won&#039;t reply to the message I sent yesterday asking for tracking either..<br /><br />So just putting this out there for newbies wanting to order...pretty upset by all this.&nbsp; If you were thinking of placing an order I would hold off...

				I am in a similar situation. I have 2 orders with him and I have no idea if they have been shipped or what.<br /><br />One I placed last Wednesday and it was marked in transit Friday.. I messaged him for tracking and he said it wouldn&#039;t be shipped until Tuesday.<br /><br />Then I placed another order Friday with express, to be shipped yesterday. Didn&#039;t show today, but I don&#039;t believe express is guaranteed overnight anymore so.. plus it could have been shipped priority. I originally got the &quot;free shipping&quot; option but he then agreed to send it express in a message, so he could have just forgotten.<br /><br />I messaged him for tracking that he said he will give me Tuesday, but the message hasn&#039;t been read and it&#039;s been about 25 hours. Not too worried about that as he has taken that long on a couple other messages.<br /><br />@OP: His vendor page says all orders placed last week were going to be shipped yesterday. I would not worry too much just yet. One thing though is the incredibly long shipping times is somewhat unacceptable. It has been a week since I placed one order and I don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s been shipped yet.<br /><br />

				Thank you laks for your experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I am just annoyed from the lack of communication..and the fact that using Express it is just a week with nothing haha<br /><br />I did not see that on his profile so I guess we&#039;ll have to wait till the end of this week also..<br /><br />Thanks!

				Yeah the communication isn&#039;t that great, which sucks, because everyone hates waiting on important messages. <br /><br />And I agree with you about the shipping. He claims to have sent all orders yesterday, but you would most likely have gotten it today if that were the case. At any rate, if any orders were shipped yesterday, they will arrive tomorrow and Friday. <br /><br />Hard vendor to work with.

				I placed an order with confidence monday, it may take some time but i dont think anything shady is going on. all orders are in escrow (since i have yet to see any FE feedback on his seller page). resolution center will come into play if it has to. Although being on a time limit is a pain when expecting something in the mail. all i can say is he was responsive im my PMs.

				Hey guys, like you I also have a few orders from KC that I&#039;m waiting on. I placed my order for a QP(2 Skywalker 2 Wifi) last Tuesday and paid for overnight shipping on both orders for an additional 60 dollars(30 each order). I waited a few days and on the third day it was marked as &quot;in transit&quot; and thought I would have a nice package waiting for me in a few days. almost 10 days later I&#039;m sitting here wondering whats going on with my money and if I&#039;ll ever get a package. From what I&#039;ve been reading he has told us all that the packages should be arriving by Friday at the LATEST. We all need to stick together and keep each other updated with any responses or info we get from KC so we can figure out if he is scamming or what. I hope everyone gets what they ordered and it was worth going through this ridiculous ordeal. I can&#039;t speak for everyone but I know I will never EVER do business with KC again. From my personal experience he has the absolute worst service and communication from any vendor I&#039;ve encountered on SR. <br /><br />Good Luck!

				I m in a similar situation :<br />I&#039;ve ordered 2oz on 14 January, he marked as &quot;in transit&quot; the day after.<br />But after two or three days, he told me, via PM, that he was really busy at the time and he could not send it until last monday.<br />I had to wait 10 days without the possibility to cancel the order and now, on 24 January he is not answering to my PMs anymore.<br />He sent me a PM on monday telling me that he was going to ship my package in that day, but after this, he is not reading/responding my messages.<br />How should I act in this case?

If I am wrong, and his intentions are ill, then I will eat my words no problem. Everybody here is right in being pissed at how long it&#039;s taken to get order shipped out, I am certainly not happy about it..<br /><br />I mean no offense, and I don&#039;t want to just bicker about it.. I&#039;m just saying give the guy a break. Like I said, if I am wrong and it turns out he doesn&#039;t have good intentions.. well then you can all say I told you so.<br /><br />

				Hopefully, everyone will receive what they paid for from him, but if he wants to keep good on his name, he will problem need to make up for the&nbsp; 30 extra he charged for overnight to most. Otherwise his ounces are priced the same as the others who have very excellent service

I got my tracking number for my orders and it says delivery is tomorrow. <br /><br />I understand you&#039;re frustrated that you paid for next day, and you every right to be because that isn&#039;t cheap. But I&#039;m sure you will get your order, and maybe if you send a NICE message to him, he would refund your shipping costs. And escrow is always there just in case.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The thing is nobody has received anything from him except lie 1 person within the past 2 weeks. How can he have &quot;alot&quot; of orders when he has a total of 30 transactions? I could EASILY package 30 boxes, keep track of who&#039;s is whos and send each the corresponding tracking information, really, its not that hard at all. It&#039;s great that YOU got your tracking number and that he has been communicating well with you, however, that doesn&#039;t mean that he isn&#039;t a &quot;selective scammer&quot; or anything. It doesn&#039;t sound weird to you that you are the only one who has gotten a message from him in the past week? I&#039;ve sent him plenty of nice messages and all he would say back to me is &quot;I assure you that you are in the best of hands brother&quot; or &quot;sorry about that brother&quot;. It&#039;s much easier for you to tell everyone else to &quot;chill&quot; since you have your information now. I have $1000 dollars just sitting there and I&#039;m supposed to be cool with knowing my package might have not even been shipped? Try to put yourself in the other person&#039;s shoes and you will understand. Glad to hear that you have heard back from him and that your package will be on it&#039;s way. That&#039;s more than 99% of us can say.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First, if I am not mistaken, it only adds to your transaction count when somebody finalizes. So you really have no clue how many orders he has to fill.<br /><br />Second, if you stayed in escrow, I don&#039;t really see how he can scam everybody. If everybody tells resolution the same things, we will all get our money back.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had $500 just sitting there for over a week, so what makes you think I wasn&#039;t in your shoes? Hell, I still am in your shoes.. all I have is a tracking number that says some package will arrive somewhere, tomorrow. I have no clue if its truly for my order or not. <br /><br />The difference is, instead of parading around the forums saying stuff like &quot;fuck this guy&quot; and &quot;this shit is stupid&quot; and &quot;nobody is getting shit&quot; like many people are, I am being patient, understanding that he may just have a lot of orders or is overwhelmed or who knows what else. If I am wrong, and his intentions are ill, then I will eat my words no problem. Everybody here is right in being pissed at how long it&#039;s taken to get order shipped out, I am certainly not happy about it..<br /><br />I mean no offense, and I don&#039;t want to just bicker about it.. I&#039;m just saying give the guy a break. Like I said, if I am wrong and it turns out he doesn&#039;t have good intentions.. well then you can all say I told you so.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think we all have been fairly patient with him, I&#039;m not so much upset that I don&#039;t have the package yet it&#039;s just extremely fishy to me that he can keep in contact with you and message you the tracking number yet he has plenty other customers who have been waiting weeks for their order as well and he doesn&#039;t even have the decency to respond to our messages that have just been sitting there, again, for a week. I wish I could have just canceled this order all together and avoided this incompetent vendor. I know I will be disappointed even if I do receive a package. It&#039;s been 10+ days and I&#039;m willing to bet the product isn&#039;t worth the scrutiny.

				I do agree, it is very weird he hasn&#039;t responded to you or some others, yet has responded to all of my messages. Don&#039;t get that myself.<br /><br />And yeah, we have all been patient enough.. agreed. Just nothing we can do at this point but wait, which SUCKS. I hate waiting.

				I placed an order with KC for an oz on 1/16. I have been watching all of the threads (I count 4 total KC-related threads) and have been ruminating on the possibilities. I&#039;ve ruled out scammer because he stays in escrow. So the only remaining options are LE or incompetence. And given that LE only does controlled deliveries where you sign, never in a way that gives you a chance to get rid of the product, and some users (such as edar who isn&#039;t even in the US) have received a package without issue, and haven&#039;t disappeared, it seems unlikely that KC is LE. The only remaining option is that he&#039;s incompetent. So absolutely incompetent that it seems really suspicious. But in reality he just wasn&#039;t in any way prepared to take on this volume of orders at his chosen prices.<br /><br />I received a tracking number, and after comparing it with another user, and him comparing with another, we&#039;ve determined that we all have different tracking info. This is a very good sign. However, my package was given to USPS only yesterday. 9 days after I placed my order, and 7 days after being marked &quot;in transit.&quot; This is either incompetence or the greatest imitation of incompetence I have ever witnessed. Copy/pasting messages to different users, failing to respond to his review thread for days, shipping only a handful of packages a day while more and more orders stack up in the meantime. I mean we are talking about a colossal fuckup here. This guy is doing it worse than it&#039;s ever been done. I&#039;m sorry if it seems like I&#039;m being harsh, this is just brutal honesty.<br /><br />I have read every post in every KC thread. There is far, far too much paranoia amongst his buyers. &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; This guy is just dumb as a fucking sea turtle.<br /><br />If I&#039;m asked to sign for a package today I&#039;ll come back and tell you all how wrong I was. But honestly I expect to get some kinda okay weed and forget that this ever happened and I recommend that everyone else does the same. Show&#039;s over, folks. Nothing to see here. <br /><br />KC, if you are reading this: Unless you somehow completely convince all these people otherwise, they are going to consider you untrustworthy or incompetent, and they&#039;re not going to order from you again. Your little foray into SR is over unless you pay another $500 for a new vendor account, because this shit is going to haunt you for the rest of your time here. And I swear to god if you come knocking at my door for anything I&#039;m saying here, you&#039;ll have a loud boom coming followed by a long silence, the longest silence.... you stupid motherfucker...

And it sucks because I generally consider myself a street-smart person. I can&#039;t believe I made such a drastic misjudgment of character on this guy. I really can&#039;t believe I made it past the typos on the vendor page and the gmail address attached to the PGP key.... <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t be surprised to learn this guy is like 15 or 16 years old.

Wish this shit could just be easy!! <br /><br />Oh, and I did see somebody said they got their order today and that it is actually pretty good shit. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Alright well hopefully it&#039;s at the other address! I look forward to seeing how everything turned out from someone who&#039;s&nbsp; stuck with us and been active through the whole process. To be honest I don&#039;t even want the QP I ordered anymore. I&#039;d rather have him cancel my order so I can order from someone who deserves the business and who is trust worthy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, I really hope so too. I hope you get either your order or your money back. <br /><br />I&#039;ll have one last report sometime tonight.. plus I&#039;m getting close to 50 posts so I don&#039;t wanna go over before I update this thread again.<br /><br />Good luck all.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110690.msg761812#msg761812">Quote from: lookingfor on January 25, 2013, 06:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Looks like his last review wasn&#039;t so good....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrible shipping time, ordered the white fire og and received some shit that wasnt even close to indoor weed much less fire og, smells terrible, looks even worse.

				Ok, so I got 1 ounce out of the two I ordered. What I got smells sour diesely, and it smells pretty good. You can see trich coverage with the naked eye. I got about 2 grams of shake, and a mixture of small buds and medium buds. It weighed to 30 grams.<br /><br />Its not bad at all, especially for just $200. I am pretty baked right now. Other than the SLOW shipping time, I am actually pleased with it.<br /><br />As for getting 1 ounce out of the two.. I had two separate orders so I bet he didn&#039;t ship the other till yesterday.

				Hello everyone!<br /><br />So I finally received my oz of White Fire OG today. Since no one has opted to do so yet, I am going to be uploading some hi-res closeup photos that I took with my macro lens camera. Right now I am transferring them from the camera, then I need to wipe the EXIF metadata from the files, and then I will upload them to a secure onion site and post links.<br /><br />Good stealth, no leaks. Handwritten label, so that&#039;s a big no-no. KC if you&#039;re reading this: PRINT YOUR GODDAMN LABELS! (if anyone even orders off you again) They look for this kind of shit. That&#039;s a big red flag for them. Since I paid for express mail and the bud showed up after 10 days, I have no choice but to give the guy a 1/5 on shipping speed, even though technically, it was only in the system 2 days. That&#039;s more of a chance thing since I happen to reside close to KC geographically.<br /><br />KC&#039;s communication was good at first. I&#039;m sure most of you are familiar with the story by now. Placed order, waited 2 days, messaged him about why it wasn&#039;t in transit yet, he marks it in transit but doesn&#039;t put it in transit, tells me he can only take a certain number of packages to the post office at one time and that he has to &quot;get to everyone in a timely manner&quot; (great job on that kiddo). I have gotten responses from KC as fast as half an hour later, which was reassuring, and 2-3 days later, which is mind-numbingly frustrating. So it&#039;s gonna have to be a 2/5 on vendor communication. Why not 1/5? It&#039;s like giving a kid points on a test because he spelled his name right. At least he wrote something. Ya know?<br /><br />The bud itself smells good to me personally. Probably just my history with certain strains, I recognize this smell as good. But it tastes like regs in the bowl. The trichs make the bud look a lot more impressive than it actually is (you&#039;ll see in the photos I post in a few). Honestly, given the fact that what I paid in BTC for this has risen in value to almost $300 since placing my order, this is not worth the price. Not worth that $300 price to me personally. 1-2 grams of shake at the bottom. Mix of a few large and mostly small buds. Slightly compressed, not to the point of significant damage. High is mellow, not overwhelming, not sensational, just decent. Bit of a creeper. 3/5 and I&#039;m being generous.<br /><br />Because of this nightmare, I am never ordering from KC again. I am also going to more closely scrutinize all future vendors. But at the same time, I am also going to leave him 5/5 feedback when I finalize and I will not be requesting a refund for the shipping price I paid. Why? Because it was my own goddamn fault to trust this trouser-pissing moron. I consider it my &quot;I&#039;m new, please take advantage of me&quot; tax. Certainly won&#039;t happen to me again.<br /><br />Decent bud, god-awful vendor. Stay away if you came to the Road for excellent, top-shelf quality product and professional service. You won&#039;t find it here. Pics coming soon.

One thing that I would kind of caution against although its your call but I would give him an honest feedback, I mean if you think it was a 5/5 experience then by all means give him the credit he deserves. However, the feedback system helps us all, not everyone who uses SR is active on the forums so sometimes the feedback and rating system are the only things that a buyer can use to judge the validity and quality of a vendor. From reading the great review you did it doesn&#039;t seem like you really had a 5/5 experience. Those are just my 2 cents though! I&#039;m glad you guys are having some success with KC, I still haven&#039;t received the tracking number or anything for my QP and don&#039;t really expect to. Just waiting on the resolution center now. <br /><br />This is my 50th post, I hope to see you guys being this active on the other forums too (:

				I know its been said before, but I can&#039;t repeat it enough for those who have in this thread: NEVER FE. For every vendor you who requires it, theres another one who will let you keep it in escrow. It may cost you a slight bit extra in the beginning, but shit, its better than not getting your stuff at all.

				Got mine yesterday, I think I got the same thing as you lookingfor. Smaller nugs, smelled slightly fruity slightly earthy. I was supposed to get half blueberry and half bubba, its hard to tell the difference between nugs and it came in one bag. Weighed out to 28.5g. <br /><br />Yes hand addressed labels is a no. You should print them out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also never received a brownie either :(
