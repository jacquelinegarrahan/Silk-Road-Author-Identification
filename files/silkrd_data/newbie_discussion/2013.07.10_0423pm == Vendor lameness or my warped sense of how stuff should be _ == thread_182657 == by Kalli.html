				Placed an order with a vendor on sunday night, it states on their profile that <br /><br />&quot;This is what you will get from us 10% extra for every customer,no finalizing early,items are pre - packed and ready to go,fast shipping - posted withing 12 hours,stealth packaging,free post &amp; packaging option, uk first class, fast turn over / processing 24/7 uk - uk delivery times no longer than 1- 3 days<br />if there is anything else i have missed, please message me, lets do this! - any less than 5/5 score i will refuse your next order as this is my choice! delivery times can be slow to fast depending where i post from&quot;<br /><br />Now my order still hasn&#039;t been processed 3 days later yet the vendor has definitely been online every day, so I wrote them a mail a day ago which has been ignored yet I know they&#039;ve been online again as they updated their profile.<br /><br />So is this acceptable behavior for a vendor or am I well within my rights to leave a low feedback score when I get my order/can cancel it ?<br /><br />Don&#039;t like to mess anyone&#039;s business up but feel like they&#039;re taking the piss, the product is for a mates birthday on the 17th but iv got a feeling its going to be late....

				I wouldn´t worry about it mate. Vendors tend to be busy and have a backlog of orders to deal with. Give him time. Also keep in mind time zones and that weekdays people have day jobs&nbsp; xD good luck! so far i&#039;ve gotten all my orders within a week. I have one pending from last friday as well.

				I made 3 orders with Loveheart and they took over 2 weeks to arrive. For UK2UK that&#039;s absolutely fucking shit.&nbsp; PM&#039;d him a week ago before they arrived asking what was up. He replied that they&#039;d be with me soon and said he&#039;d refund one of the orders when they arrived to make up for the delay.<br /><br />Sent 2 PMs to him 3 days ago to say they had arrived and he hasn&#039;t even read them. <br /><br />Thing is, the quality of his drugs isn&#039;t bad at all. If he&#039;d bothered to send my shit out in a timely manner I would have ordered several more times from him in the time I&#039;ve been waiting for the first lot of orders.<br /><br />Judging from his feedback as well as my own experiences with him - he&#039;s clearly not a professional.&nbsp; I&#039;m very disappointed.&nbsp; Some people clearly have fuck all ambition.<br /><br />

				Yeah not answered any of my mails and it clearly wasn&#039;t shipped when said as I ordered from germany at the same time and that got here 2 days ago, ordered some tabs uk-uk yesterday they turned up this morning and ReD EyE always gets my hash to me the next day so there&#039;s NO WAY it was sent when stated. <br /><br />There&#039;s also no way im leaving a 5/5 for a vendor who ignores every mail iv sent plus lies about when it was sent and makes me wait far longer then I should for a domestic order. Even if the gear is good the customer service is an epic fail.

				Yeah I know bud its the fact iv only dealt with decent vendors up to now that probably gave me unreal expectations and I have to say 99% of all people iv had anything to do with have been polite and very fair to deal with (I get free testers of new stuff in stock and even offers of credit from a vendor i use regular when im in a tight spot) along with some great people i talk to in the spare coin thread who have helped me out in more then one way. <br /><br />All in all im very impressed with the community we have here, it goes way beyond anything I expected so kudos to all you decent vendors and customers for making this the great place it is :)

				Yeah got the stuff about ten days after I was supposed to, stuff wasn&#039;t bad as it goes as well. They never replied to mail but suppose I&#039;m just lucky it arrived at all. Shame really if they put the work in they had a decent other products too from what I saw in the feedback.
