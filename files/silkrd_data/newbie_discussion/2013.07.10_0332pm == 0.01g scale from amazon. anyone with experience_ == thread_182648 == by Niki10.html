				I am thinking to buy 0.01g (10 milligramms) scale from amazon.<br /><br />But what I hear is that the scale must be with a special cover when I mesure my product because of the air which press on the scale and give some more additional milligramms<br /><br />CAN IT REALLY BE?????????<br /><br />or is normal scale without any anti-air/anti-wind cover also ok?<br /><br />Peace

				i bought a 0.01g (max 300g) digi scale from amazon for about 15eur and has been great so far. It has the TARE button, so you can place the lid as a container to weigh your stuff (just press tare after placing the lid) and then place the gear. has measured fine so far, not needed any special cover/bag. and has measured 0.01g precisely

				It&#039;s the high precision lab type scales that can benefit from a cover. A relatively small air flow such directly down from an air conditioning duct could affect a high precision scale as the force distributes over the surface area of the weighing area. I would say one test would be take that scale, and after taring, blow maybe 6 inches away from the surface and see if it registers anything. Not sure if a .01g scale would see anything, maybe it would, but a .0001g almost certainly would.

I blew with medium strength from about 6 inches away and the scale jumped to 0.19g. Nicely pointed out. But if you blow from any higher it doesnÂ´t register anything. So should be cool if you are indoors.

				I bought an awesome 0.001 - 10g scale for ~$14.00 on ebay a couple months back to weigh out some molly. I would check there as well.

				Wow I didn&#039;t think it would affect it that much. I picked up a neat one while browsing at Willy&#039;s Electronics a while back, it seems to work pretty well though I haven&#039;t used it many times.
