				hey all, i have this question. When i sent a message to a Vendor, in the &quot;sent&quot; folder it is there as &quot;unread&quot; and with Bold. Does this means it is unread for me? or for the Vendor? cause when i read it, again it is with bold. Is it a sighn of WHEN actually the Vendor has read my messages??? <br /><br />Thanks all in advance for any helpful replies

				oh, that makes sense, And it is really nice for buyers to know when their message is actually read. So i made my first order on SR&nbsp; yesterday, from a top Vendor, who (apart from the last messages that i confirm my order) had answered quick any questions i had. How long is it usually in &quot;processing&quot; ??? What Should i do in case Vendor Seems incative for a whole week or so? There is no chance that i lose my money through escrow , if seller disappears from eatrh, right???&nbsp; oh i am so nervous... its my first order, and i was so glad that i made it to buy bitcoins and successfully transfer them on SR, to buy sth yesterday, so that it is shipped today... but no answer from this vendor, i hope he is ok and not busted..<br /><br />What you all think, what is the average time of &quot;processing&quot;

				forgot to mention that vendor was &quot;last seen TODAY&quot; . So he must be busy preparing orders instead of reading the PM. is that a good sign ??

Some vendors get many emails and orders each day so can&#039;t always reply straight away. Also if your last message to him was just confirming the order you actually placed, you might not get a reply as its not needed for the transaction. <br /><br />hope that helps :) its probably a good idea to read through the forums a bit more too.

				yes, you can tell when the vendor has read your message when it is not in bold anymore.

				I am having the same problem :( It is my first order and it is now marked as in transit. Yet I messaged the vendor before to make some arrangements and he did not answer, he has great reviews and is one of the top vendors but it makes me nervous he not answering
