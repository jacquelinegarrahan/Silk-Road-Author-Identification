				Hi, I wanted to share my experience with a recent purchase.&nbsp; The Seller was quick and efficient however upon trying the product I realized it was probably mis-labelled.&nbsp; I sent the Seller a message.&nbsp; I hope he gets back to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Django<br /><br />Seller: Raverlove<br />Product: 250 MDMA capsules (140mg per cap)<br />Issue: Advertised as MDMA but IMO it&#039;s BK-MDMA.<br /><br />=============================<br /><br />Hi Raverlove,<br /><br />I wanted to get back you about your product in hopes that we can work together to keep Silk Road successful.<br /><br />I bought 250 MDMA capsules (140mg per cap) from you a few weeks ago. I had a chance to try them on 3 separate occasions. I am 95% sure what you sold me is BK-MDMA and not MDMA.<br /><br />1. Physical Characteristics. The appearance was that of &quot;flour&quot;. In my experience this is associated most commonly with BK. MDMA, one way or the other, looks crystally, or at worst, like smashed up crystals.<br />2. Dosage. At .14mg/capsule it was a weak dosage. Most MDMA would have me flying at that dose but for a proper BK roll one needs about 2x the dose of MDMA. In the past I have found this to be around .22mg. Once I re-upped with another capsuel I was feeling pretty good.<br />3. It lacked that desire for &quot;human connection&quot; that is very consistent with MDMA.<br /><br />I happen to enjoy BK-MDMA. However, you billed it as MDMA. I bought it as MDMA. I have experienced users expecting MDMA. I am not sure how we can rectify this. At some level I feel an obligation to the Road to warn other buyers. My next step is to revise my rating and add a small review as well as a review in the forum. I would like to get your thoughts before doing so. I am very opened minded and willing to forgive is this was a truly a mistake.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Django

				There is a thread on reddit where Raverlove admits that he got a batch of BK-MDMA mixed with MDMA crystals.&nbsp; He said that he is trying to rectify the situation.&nbsp; He said that if you send him proof (in the form of a positive reagent test for BK-MDMA) he will reship with MDMA. <br /><br />&nbsp; I have another problem with RaverLove, and will post in another thread, but to summarize,&nbsp; I placed an order with him, have sent him 3 messages, and nothing.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t responded, or marked the order as in transit.&nbsp; Although he states on his vendor page that if you order before midnight, it will go out the next day.

				I would like to update my previous post.&nbsp; raverlove did refund my transaction upon request.&nbsp; So, him/her and I are cool.&nbsp; My only issue with him/her is the lack of communication.&nbsp; This is a &quot;shady&quot; business we are dealing with, and when you feel like you are being ignored, it can make you uncomfortable.
