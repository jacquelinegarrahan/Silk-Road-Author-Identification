				So, for my first buy I ordered a small amount from a pretty reputable vendor and followed the protocol. It&#039;s been a few days and it&#039;s still processing I&#039;ve sent 2 messages and haven&#039;t had a reply, I know I should be patient but is it really this long to get some sorta service with your first purchase?

				Some vendors require you to have x amount of transactions or you to have spent x amount of money before they will even deal with you.<br />If the vendor you chose has a policy like that im sure (since you already messaged him a couple times) he will get back at you and probably<br />cancel your order. But sometimes it may take a day or 2 for a vendor to get back at you.<br /><br />Just chill and in the meantime browse the road for the product your looking for, seek out vendors who have the highest ratings, then look for the<br />ones that (on their profile page) state newbies are welcome.<br /><br />It also wont hurt to communicate with a vendor before you make a purchase with him/her

				Sometimes vendors are just busy. <br /><br />You have the option to cancel without penalty after 4 days if you are unhappy with their responsiveness. <br />These guys want your business, don&#039;t forget that. There is plenty of other vendors who will be more timely and responsive. <br /><br />I have here a couple of weeks now, have had 8 or so deliveries, never been asked to FE and no need to message the vendor after making a purchase. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be put off if this transaction has jarred a little, just do your research and I am sure you will have your first of many packages arriving at your door soon.<br /><br />Tip: Starting small and local is probs the safest way to get your purchasing stats headed in the right direction.<br /><br />Have fun.

				ok folks - just did my first buy with a top class vendor. he wanted me to FE due to my first buy; i&#039;m ok with that. here&#039;s the questions for some of you more experienced players:<br />1. how do you cancel an order? if i see a vendor and merch i want, but vendor is taking all day to view and i have others PM me about buys, how do i cancel original order and go with someone more responsive? do i lose BTC in this process? <br />1.a. side question here. i had an order cancelled for me and was charged .01 BTC - what is this? a service fee? a cancel fee? wtf?<br /><br />2. second question - are there any other top vendors to change MP to BTC? i&#039;ve used the popular ones but charge 20% per transaction?? C&#039;mon. who can charge 5-8% transaction charge? 20% is absurd...any ideas.<br />2.a. also, during this BTC mania, how can some vendors sit on orders, not update their prices and watch the BTC go up (therefore their merch) go up in price while we still have the same amount of BTC? you know what i mean, right - i put an order in at .90 BTC and then 3 hours, this same product is 1.00 BTC?? WTF? any idea, any help?<br /><br />thx for reading...

Once you do that, it&#039;s easy to see that vendor prices are pretty constant, but your account balance will fluctuate based on the BTC market (which, as you know, has been pretty wild recently).
