				The Illuminati took down the Silk Road because World War 3 and full martial law/ police state are just around the corner now.<br /><br />Look at gold and silver, there is a massive shortage now in physical gold and physical silver. The entire bogus economic system is about to come crashing down. The Illuminati will use this to implement martial law and a police state.<br /><br />Soon, you won&#039;t be able to walk down the street without passing through ID checks with armed soldiers.<br /><br />You Americans were too lazy to defend your freedom and now it has been taken from you.

				Disgruntled buyer / seller? No<br /><br />Random malevolent prick with nefarious hacking skills, maybe but I doubt it?<br /><br />The source in my opinion that has the &quot;largest&quot; motive and an actual fucking agenda?&nbsp; Other vendor site(s).&nbsp; That&#039;s my humble opinion and it&#039;s working to some extent, some people are&nbsp; &nbsp;caving in because they need to generate money and of course there are those amongst us who &quot;need&quot; to buy &quot;stuff&quot; so this downtime is having a pretty severe affect on both vendors and buyers and the other competitors are offering incentives to join and their customer bases are growing as a result I am certain.&nbsp; I have checked out a few other sites and see familiar vendors are already there.&nbsp; It may be obvious and already stated a dozen times(?) but that seems to make the most sense.&nbsp; Damn am I glad I am not being impacted &quot;that&quot; much.&nbsp; I mean, I have some orders that have already been delivered, and I am waiting to get paid, but for those that are more so affected, I feel for them, especially if a buyer who has&nbsp; a habit is F&#039;d because they can&#039;t get their product, of course they will jump ship and go to the other vendors.&nbsp; No one ever wants to buy shit on the actual &quot;streets&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s just not a cool scene (hopefully those days are diminishing and most things will remain online)and then you&#039;re really exposing yourself to potential pain and trouble with the cops.&nbsp; The thing the DEA should get is that this site is taking a lot of drugs off the streets and cleaning them up to some degree. I am not sure what the percentages are obviously but it has to be to some degree.&nbsp; For this reason, even a highly conservative Republican would have to admit, the SR has a purpose, but back to the OP&#039;s question, that&#039;s my take.

				Most likely Atlantis(Or another site) trying to compete with the Silk Road. The ransom thing is probably just a bad attempt to disguise this.
