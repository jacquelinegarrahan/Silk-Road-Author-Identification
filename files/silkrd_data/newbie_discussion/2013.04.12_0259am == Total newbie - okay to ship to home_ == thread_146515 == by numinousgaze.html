				Hey guys, brand new here!<br /><br />So, obviously there&#039;s a lot to take in. I think I&#039;ve got the gist of it, but I definitely would like some advice before moving forward.<br /><br />First question: Is it okay to have my purchases delivered to my home? Keep in mind that I&#039;m only interested in small amounts of ketamine for strictly personal use. I don&#039;t have anywhere else to have my orders delivered, so is it fine to have them delivered to my home?<br /><br />Secondly, how do I go about buying Bitcoins anonymously? I found an article that lists instructions here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2012/04/how-to-buy-bitcoins-anonymously-in-the-us-instantly/<br /><br />Are these instructions legit? <br /><br />What if I simply used Dwolla to buy coins on Mtgox, deposited my coins into a bitcoin wallet like Mybitcoin, and then deposited that into my SR wallet? Is that secure enough? Obviously, Dwolla knows all of my personal information.<br /><br />Thanks for the help everyone! I know us noobs must pop up all the time. Thanks for your patience.

				Welcome! first answer: yes, go for it.&nbsp; personal amounts are nothing to worry about, especially if you use a well known vendor who doesn&#039;t suck at packaging which most are very good at.&nbsp; the only reason people talk about using other locations is if its a large order that has a higher risk of being uncovered but even then, its still hard to prove you ordered it.&nbsp; <br /><br />second answer: the bad part about dwolla is that it takes a long time to get money into the account.&nbsp; the quickest, most anonymous way is to use a trading site like bitfloor (my personal favorite). set up an account with a new email address, and start depositing cash.&nbsp; you just go to any bank of america and deposit the exact amount of cash they tell you to based on your request.&nbsp; by the time you get home, your money should be ready to purchase btc with.&nbsp; from there you send it on over to your sr wallet (some people like to send it through a few other wallets first but you have to go through some more fees) and youre good to order whatever your heart&#039;s desire (provided you have enough money).

				Thanks for the rapid response man. Appreciated!<br /><br />I&#039;m checking out bitfloor. Do they allow you to use tormail? Also, I guess they were hacked last last year. Is this still an issue?<br /><br />One last thing - how do I use PGP/GPG? I know, noobiest question ever. I don&#039;t expect you to write a tutorial on it, haha. I&#039;m running on Ubuntu Linux, and I guess GnuPG is the program I&#039;m supposed to be using to do all of this, but I&#039;m having a lot of difficultly simply downloading it using Tor (I&#039;m getting the &quot;connection from invalid IP&quot; error). I take it I should be trying to download the source 1.4 version?<br /><br />Thanks again mate!

A silly question in first place I suppose. To be perfectly honest, I&#039;m just a little nervous making a purchase on here. It seems almost too good to be true! In reality, I&#039;m probably just overthinking the entire process, haha.<br /><br />Well, got my bitfloor account. I think I&#039;m going to deposit into one additional wallet before depositing it into my SR account, just to be on the safe side. Does it take much time to deposit coins into wallets, or is it pretty much instant?<br /><br />EDIT: Got my bitfloor account, but I can&#039;t really use the website, I think because I have scripts disabled in Tor. I&#039;m not entirely sure what this does, but it&#039;s advised to keep them disabled. Is it cool to enable them for bitfloor?
