				You really should do some pretty intensive research on any particular vendor before you place an order.

Bring it to resolution when the resolution center is back up (48 hours from the time the site went back up, as long as there are no interruptions) and explain the situation to an administrator.<br /><br />During resolution the administrator will review the history of both buyer and seller and weigh up any evidence that is presented to them. I would recommend you include the message that you received where you were &quot;laughed at&quot; by the vendor, including its date and time so as the administrator can check that out.<br /><br />If they find that the vendor has acted in such a way that suggests he/she is guilty of the accused act then they will most likely find in your favour.<br /><br />Libertas

Administrators can easily see messages. As long as you didn&#039;t finalize, you&#039;ll be fine.
