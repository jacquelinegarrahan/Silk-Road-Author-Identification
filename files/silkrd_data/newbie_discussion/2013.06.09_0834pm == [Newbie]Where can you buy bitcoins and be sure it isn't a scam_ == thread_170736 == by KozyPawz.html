				Go on SR and look up the vendor named Moneyhoney.&nbsp; He/she charges a 5% fee and will give you bitcoins in exchange for a green dot moneypak.&nbsp; They explain more on their page on how it&#039;s done.&nbsp; I did it yesterday myself and received the bitcoins a couple of hours later.&nbsp; Bitinstant is down for the weekend for cash deposits and that&#039;s what I normally use, but moneyhoney works well if you want bitcoins today.&nbsp;

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
