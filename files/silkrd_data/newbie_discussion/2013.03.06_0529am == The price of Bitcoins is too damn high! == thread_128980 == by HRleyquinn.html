				I&#039;m holding back on several purchases here because the BTC price is clearly headed for a crash. I&#039;m actually afraid that in the time it takes for me to deposit money, transfer to BTC, send to a wallet, then send to SilkRoad, I could lose half the value of my BTC. Today alone, the price went up USD $5. At one time -- not so long ago -- that was the price of one BitCoin. Now it&#039;s 1/7 a BitCoin.<br /><br />I&#039;m not buying anything until there&#039;s a quick and safe way to buy BitCoins, or there is some relative stability in the price. It&#039;s too much money to play with.

				Find someone near you on localbitcoins.com and just tell them you want to meet and do the transaction out of the site. I met a dude and gave him cash. he transfered the coins straight to my sr address in front of me from his phone. the coins showed up after a few hours. two and a half weeks ago I could have gotten the coins for $18 a coin, but waited and had to pay $35 a coin. I didnt want to wait for them to go up any higher which they have.

				I would not bet on that crash.&nbsp; Sure, there will be corrections along the way, but last time it was $30+ and then crashed to $2 or something there was no infrastructure to support the price.&nbsp; Very few people were using coins back then.&nbsp; Now we have online gambling, a vibrant and growing Silk Road community with all of the transactions that entails, and we also have investment banks and venture capitalists all throwing their money into the bitcoin ring.&nbsp; We have a real economy and bitcoin can be used to purchase almost anything these days.&nbsp; If you are betting on a big crash again, I have to bet against you.

				&gt;clearly headed for a crash<br /><br />Yeah, well, that&#039;s just, like, your opinion, man.<br /><br />I&#039;ve personally been trying to study what&#039;s causing this sudden increase in BTC prices. Yeah, BTC has gradually become more accepted over the past several weeks -- key word &quot;gradually&quot;. The likelihood of a crash similar to the Summer 2011 crash is probably low, because there haven&#039;t been any Gawker articles about a certain onion site so as to cause many people to suddenly dickride BTC. I do think the price increases seem a little higher than expected, but, I dunno lol.<br /><br />In the long term, however? A definite considerable increase in value.

How soon do vendors adjust their prices to match?<br /><br />for example, let&#039;s say a certain product cost $180, which amounts to about BTC4.5<br /><br />And then the next day, bitcoins rise to $50/BTC1<br /><br />I basically want to know how much should I wait until I place my order?<br /><br />

				thank you for the quick replies.<br /><br />I figured it would be something like that. Do all vendors have the same option? <br /><br />I always set my SR page to show prices in USD, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be short when I actually charge my account, forgive my ignorance, but am I &#039;safe&#039; if I just put the prices to show in USD and recharge my account accordingly? <br /><br />thanks!

				I studied bitcoin for the first time not longer then a week ago. I decided to invest everything i got to it, since then im 10% up on my investment not complaining, but its kinda same though you end up paying a little bit more for the producst because the currency rises while your ordered items are on transit and btc sitting on escrow.

				Okay, so if your money loses/gains value (potentially) in Escrow. Then let&#039;s say I bought products worth BTC5, then as I received my product, I went to finalize only to find that they now cost BTC6.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say I don&#039;t have that kind of money in my account, and I have no way to get it, what happens then?<br /><br />Just trying to understand this whole thing, loopholes and what not.<br /><br />

				It does not matter how high the price or bitcoins gains because the value of the products bought with bitcoins will just go lower and be cheaper being purchase with Bitcoins and higher and more expensive with paper dollars.&nbsp; So stock up and invest in Bitcoins....

				here&#039;s another example. I have my mushrooms pegged at the US dollar(not here, see sig) so the price doesn&#039;t go through the roof. I can&#039;t be here cause i can&#039;t afford the 25BTC to become a seller here. But if I keep the price low pegged at the dollar and it stays the same BTC to become a seller here, I may never make it at this rate. since the BTC price of my shrooms keeps going down. This of course also means the price to become a vendor here is now higher than the 500 bucks last week<br /><br />I think if SR keeps the entry fee pegged at BTC more people might use alternatives, at least at first like I am. I don&#039;t have much of a choice until I can make the 25BTC<br /><br />it works both ways...I know some sellers have their shrooms pegged at BTC and now it&#039;s pretty expensive compared to a month ago. Not me tho. I want to actually sell them..LOL

				BTC isn&#039;t a hidden currency anymore, many many people know about it. I&#039;ve seen it on the UK news a couple of times as well, meaning it&#039;s getting media attention. <br /><br />More and more people see it as a solid investment now, and it&#039;s going to keep rising for a while longer I think. As for the price thing you talk about, why does that matter, $60 woth of BTC is $60 no matter if it&#039;s 100 coins, or .5 of a coin. <br /><br />Most vendors will peg their listings to $$$, so it usually wont make a difference to the cost in price. The only way a crash would be bad is for all the people who have a large amount of coins. (Investors, vendors, DPR and so on)

				If you place a 100BTC order for gear, they send it to you and you release the funds. Now the vendor has 100btc, but they have to convert that to cash for it to be of any real use to them (unless they are using it to buy other gear). So if the price of 1btc drops from $50 to $20 before they cash out, they went from having $5,000 to $2,000.

				I remember having the same exact concerns before. But basically, it doesn&#039;t matter what BitCoin costs really. As long as you are using a vendor who pegs his price to the USD instead of BitCoin, something that costs $100 will remain at $100 constantly, even though it may cost more or less actual coins. I don&#039;t totally understand, but there are a few safeguards built-in to the SR to protect against the volatility of the BitCoin market and ensure that nobody, either the seller or vendors, gets burned. <br /><br />I do remember somebody saying that unless you plan to &quot;invest&quot; and hold your coins, which I don&#039;t plan to do at this point, then you&#039;d be best off buying your coins and spending them right away. So only get enough USD&#039;s worth of coins to buy whatever you intend to buy, then spend them right away.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the more I think about it the more worried I get because I have been trying to get some coins for a while now.

				I&#039;m having a hard time understanding the surge in value.&nbsp; One thing I have noticed, is that this value surge is on very little volume which may indicate a bubble.&nbsp; Does anyone know the breakdown of where the supposed 22% of active bitcoins are spent?&nbsp; If a large number is spent on SR, which seems likely, and the prices are pegged to the USD, then it seems even harder to explain the surge.&nbsp; For the average SR user and seller BTC value means little because the prices are linked to the USD.&nbsp; It makes the increased value seem almost imaginary...<br /><br />Anybody seen a good explanation? I understand that there are a limited quantity of Bitcoins unlike USD so it is deflationary of time by design.&nbsp; However, this doesn&#039;t explain the huge surge.&nbsp; Anyone have a good explanation that isn&#039;t simply a prototypical Libertarian argument that it&#039;s because of free market and no regulation. That wouldn&#039;t explain what the market forces actually are...<br /><br />Thanks

				as a new user trying to understand BTC, its like THE safest investment, as the demand for it in market rises so does its exchange value. The most important is that over time its ONLY RISING! so this is good for us,&nbsp; if we buy today we will pay less tomorrow, or even in a week that the order will have arrived. Well if theres going to be a crash i really doubt about it. i can bet (to myself) that in the summer it will be 80-100 usd, this because SR is becoming so popular. (as newbs we all tell our trusted friends about it, dont we?) And will be goin for a long time, wish i had money to invest.... <br />In other words, for us the buyers, its wise to wait for the BTC to rise so that u have more dollars to spend than you had at start. The same goes for vendors, they get eg 5 BTC and they convert it after a month with higher value per BTC comparing to the time he got them.<br /><br />Its an invenstmvent, for everyone, from any point of view, unless all the BITCOIN system crashes, but really how possible is that? How safe am i using the bticoin-qt wallet?? how people make fortunes with BTC mining...? its all so complicated, yet working...<br />

				so can anyone confirm what is happening when you wait to FE / receive the order? if you have paid 2 BTC for a standar priced product at 50usd ,&nbsp; and due to rise of the rate, now the day to Finalize (after 2 weeks lets say) the BTC is 1.8 BTC=50usd. What happens? does the vendor get paid at the price of the day making the order? or the escrow release the 0.2 back to my account???<br /><br />Someone who knows please answer this for me

				I think the payment value is freezed at the moment your order.<br /><br />Meaning if you pay 2.5 BTC when ordering that&#039;s what the seller will receive at the end of escrow (and maybe a commission from SR ?).<br /><br />After all the only purpose of escrow is to temporarily put aside the payment until package delivery is confirmed. That wouldn&#039;t be fair to leave the payment freely fluctuating to market value for weeks.<br /><br />On the other hand, if the customer recovers its payment from escrow (refund) , then it wouldn&#039;t be fair either to just give back the exact same BTC value initially given to escrow.<br /><br />

				i mean, because most sellers have a standar price in USD,&nbsp; that means the actual BTC you need for the item changes frequently. If i pay 2.5 and the seller gets 2.5 while in between shipping and reciving/finalizing , the bitcoin value has risen and now the 2.5 BTC are more USD than the sellers listing, what happens, you get the rest BTC back??? the initial payment to BTC is locked&nbsp; on the value on the day of order, or not?
