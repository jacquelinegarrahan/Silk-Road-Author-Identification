				as an avid reader of Bloomberg (and the Times as my other daily bread), I encountered in this week&#039;s edition of Bloomberg, an article that only seemed to skim the surface of the online pharmacy business. So perhaps this article is more pertinent to the bajillion of IOPs that seem to presently exist (as affiliates of perhaps far fewer core distributors) than the SR community of sellers/buyers<br />but in any case, I just figured I would share the article for one&#039;s pleasure reading: (will not post link for maybe security reasons) title of article &quot;Inside Big Pharma&#039;s fight against the $75 billion counterfeit drug business&quot;<br /><br />Albeit the article&#039;s focus on Viagra and counterfeit drugs, I did find it (only slightly) amusing that a particular &quot;drop shipper&quot; was practically breaking all the laws in the book of SR&#039;s guide to selling; in any case, for the sake of brevity, I want to end this post with what I thought was the most memorable claim from the article: &quot;Drugmakers i.e.Pfizer now field their own security squads. Pfizer&#039;s maybe the most aggressive.&quot; It reminds me of the initiatives taken by the private music/film entertainment industry in investing their own money into targeting &quot;file sharing delinquents&quot;<br /><br />anyways, happy reading<br />(for a more shallow journalistic attempt at exploring IOPs, I suggest NPR&#039;s recent article titled &quot;Black Market Pharmacies And The Big Business Of Spam&quot;; a rather stark contrast to the far more revealing Gawker&#039;s article on SR that went viral about just under a year ago I believe)

				There was also an interesting documentary by bloomberg recently examining the sale of opiates in the state of Florida.<br />Some of the so called &quot;pain clinics&quot; also employed there own security forces.

It&#039;s been pretty publicized. Not that people not knowing about it is a bad thing, SR is experiencing plenty of growing pains as is. Also I hate seeing people brag about their &quot;SR quality&quot; drugs like all drugs from here are magically pure or something. Just a pet peeve. <br />Sounds like an interesting article though, I&#039;ll have to check it out.
