				A little note about identity - This is the glue that holds everything together---by keeping them separate!!! you have 2 identities now. you real one and your anonymous id. If you utilize the TOR network correctly, you can stay anonymous. Personally, i use a stolen laptop, on a &quot;borrowed&quot; open connection, surfing through TAILs live flash drive with no persistence. I have never googled m0s1n or silk road or anything about my second identity/life outside of tails. Likewise, while in tails, ill never google my real name, go to fb or youtube, check my real email or anything like that. when im in tails, my first identity is dead. When you&#039;re identities meet, you have to burn it. If you burn your identity, you burn your reputation, if you burn your reputation you have to start over. no &quot;special deals&quot; any more. Also, don&#039;t talk about anything personal on here. You have no idea how little information about you is needed to be able to identify you. TOR will never blow your cover. The only one who can do that is you. <br /><br />Points of contact with LEO&#039;s<br /><br />buying - Just like buying on the street, you need to be informed in order to buy safely. On the street, you rely on word of mouth, reputation, and respect when determining if it&#039;s going to be a safe buy. Utilizing the feedback system and vendor reviews from other users is the key to staying informed. Also being active on the forums is another great way for you to connect with the vendors and speak with them on a personal level. After you select a vendor and complete your purchase, you will need to send some money to the vendor(or LEO!!!). Use your bitcoins! And if you&#039;re extra paranoid like me, you can use a bitcoin mixing service as well. (Read about mixing here hxxp://www.bitcoinfog.com/) This(the buy) is going to be the first instance where your pseudo-identity and real identity will cross paths. The vendor has the upper hand here as he is the ONLY one who can remain completely anonymous. It&#039;s just the nature of the beast. The vendor is going to need your real address and your real name so they can mail your product to you. People use fake names and addresses all the time. Some times this works, most of the time the package is undeliverable. My only advice here is to use extreme discretion when selecting your vendor because the product in which you&#039;re buying will eventually touch your hands no matter how much cloak and dagger (you utilize. This is normal but still risky. Use gpg to encrypt your message to the vendor by using their public key. You can read more about gpg and how to use it here hxxp://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/ ) At the top of the newbie section, there&#039;s a gpg practice area with loads of helpful people that will have a short encrypted conversation with you if you want some practice. A decent vendor should destroy your records after the transaction is complete.<br /><br />Accepting Delivery: Have it delivered to your house or you can get a fake id for about $150-200 and use that to open a po box. Do some research. This part isn&#039;t that big of a deal. Just make sure you never sign for any packages, and any package that gets delivered to you should have &quot;return to sender&quot; written on it IMMEDIATELY and be placed by your door. Let it cool off for a day or two. Most of the LEOs are trying to get you to throw away your plausible deniability(i swear your honer, i had no idea what was in the box. some asshole must have sent this to me just to get me in trouble. I know its not believable your honer, but you have no evidence to prove otherwise because i stayed anonymous on the silk road and didn&#039;t use real money)<br /><br />selling - I&#039;m not a seller. I never have been. Dro out here costs me 300 per oz. I&#039;m a consumer. I&#039;m here to safely buy weed. But i will say this... your reputation is worth way more than your product. Always remember that.<br /><br />transporting - Transportation should only be done during the daytime during rush hour traffic. Use your cruise control, stay in the right lane, drive 2-3mph OVER the speed limit. Find out what your local laws are concerning weights and try to keep what you&#039;re holding under a felony. If you are stopped, be polite, don&#039;t lie if he asks you if you know why you got stopped. If he goes straight back to his car, you&#039;re golden. If he starts asking a bunch of questions, then you either look nervous, scared, or black. at this point you&#039;re fucked. shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up. refuse any searches. you&#039;re going to jail. it&#039;s going to happen. the cops job now is to hit you with as many charges as he can come up with and hope a few stick. He&#039;ll make you believe that he&#039;s not going to take you to jail if you cooperate. If you believe this then you&#039;re retarded. If you stopped talking like you were supposed to, then he&#039;s probably screaming at you now. He&#039;ll say some bullshit like if you don&#039;t start talking, I&#039;ll make your life hell. (he cant. he&#039;s a cop. judges hate cops. judges can and will make your life hell. Probation officers too!) just keep quiet and know that you&#039;re going to jail for a few hours and that&#039;s it. he cant scare you with anything else. that&#039;s ok. you&#039;ll be out in hours.<br /><br />storing - storing is a simple matter really. If you&#039;re going to keep more than a felony weight on hand, no one should know you have it. How can the cops find it if you&#039;re never snitched on or never give them a reason to enter your house? Be smart!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Three things to leave behind:&nbsp; what you have taught to others, what you have created with your own hands, and how much love you have spread<br /><br />Three ways to lose excellence: to become a servant to one&#039;s passions, to not learn from the examples set by others, to indulge to excess.<br /><br />The wise avoid expecting the impossible, grieving over the irretrievable, and fearing the inevitable.<br /><br />M0s1n - /|\
