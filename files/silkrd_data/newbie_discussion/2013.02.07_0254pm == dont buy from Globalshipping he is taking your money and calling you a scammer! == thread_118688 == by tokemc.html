				Wow this sucks bro, hopefully something will come through for you. Otherwise on your next order maybe make it for a smaller amount and with a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE. Sorry for your loss.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about your loss, but this is why all new members are told several times to read the forums, wiki and do your research, and then do it again !<br /><br />You might be in luck if you bring it up with the SR Support team but do not hold your breath, yes I know it is hard for new users to get anything larger or first purcahses from some vendors but there is a way around that !<br /><br />I can not say it enough that it is really important that you do your research and keep on lurkign the forums to learn more and more.<br /><br />-bbw

				It&#039;s reading threads like this that anger me so!&nbsp; Here I&#039;ve got bags and bags of different kinds of bud I grew in my yard in So Cal, and cannot fathom why in the world this amazing plant is not being grown in every yard and byway!&nbsp; I am very sorry for your being scammed, and count my many blessings at being able to grow marijuana without many issues .....&nbsp; good luck!<br /><br />And I&#039;d bring this same thread up over at the Reddit SR page.

				o.k globalshipping is one of my best vendors....i know that in late january he had some big family problems and he posted this message on his vendor page...<br /><br />Update 28/01<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Dear costumers, these last days were really bad for me. Had a couple of personal problems and anwanted family visits that could destroy my operation.<br />i had to relocate all my supplies to another place and couldnt process orders. I also mixed all of them so i send orders that were placed later before older orders and stuff so some of you should have some delays on the arrival of shipments.<br />DO NOT WORRY ALL ORDERS WILL ARRIVE EVEN IF THEY ARE A LITTLE LATE!<br /><br />Please be calm and wait, problems happen and i make everything i can so that my identity and your addresses are not compromised.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d842b8827e<br /><br />so maybe u should check in with him again....cos from my xperience he is a stand up vendor who is a credit to SR...

				DO NOT TRUST THIS VENDOR!!! <br /><br />I made and order from him and he asked to FE, like in hes vendor page says if I live in &quot;risky&quot; country then need to FE. I had no problem whit that, because the vendor stats seems really good top 17. what is really nice.<br />I made an FE 15 minutes before he sent me a message and now he dont respond to my messages, I have sent him like 7 messages and he has not answered non of them. But have been online.<br />&nbsp;I know I was fool to FE before, but stats and reviews seems really good and I thought that he is not a scammer! <br /><br />I want to WARN other people, Do Not Trust This VENDOR!!!
