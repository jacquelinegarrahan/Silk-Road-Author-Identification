				I was wondering if a vendor has a button where he/she can become inactive as a vendor and become a normal registered member. I recently made a large purchase and the vendor the next day does not have a seller page anymore. I messaged my vendor and they informed me they were taking a break to get caught up. Communication has been excellent, but i am worried about a potential scam. This was a reputable vendor with 300 transactions and a 100 rating.

				A vendor can choose to go into stealth mode, which is what you described.&nbsp; If you have the vendor in your favorites you can still view his store.&nbsp; The vendor can choose to continue trading with customers who have the link to his page/ him faved or through individual listing urls.&nbsp; If the vendor wants to get back, all it takes is disabling stealth mode.<br />It&#039;s probably nothing to worry about, it&#039;s not unusual for vendors to go into stealth as they take breaks.&nbsp;

				Thanks a lot guys. I&#039;m glad I was overthinking. I&#039;ve been on the road for well over a year now, and ive been scammed one time. It just had a similar feeling when i saw that.

				Could a vender just post that he&#039;s on vacation .. wouldn&#039;t that negate the need for a vacation mode?<br />
