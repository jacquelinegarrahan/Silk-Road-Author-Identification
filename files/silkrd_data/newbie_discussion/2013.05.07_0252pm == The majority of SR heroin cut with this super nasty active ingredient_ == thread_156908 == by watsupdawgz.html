				Having been an opiate user for more than a year, I&#039;ve come to notice that the majority of the heroin I&#039;ve tried has this very specific, incredibly nasty cut. It causes extreme nausea that is totally disproportionate to the high. It causes some mild fever-like symptoms and a mild headache. It ruins the high. I can say with certainty that this is a cut. I&#039;ve had batches that had a completely clean high, where I could get massively high and throw up and still feel great. This goes for pharmaceuticals aswell; I&#039;ve never gotten that super shitty feeling from pharms which seems to confirm my theory. This cut is not just me getting too high, it&#039;s a very specific feeling that is NOT just doing too much of an opiate. I makes me incapable of really doing anything. I just sit still pondering how shitty I feel, afraid to move as it will likely result in puking. With clean opiates I feel awesome even when I&#039;m throwing up.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if anyone else has noticed this.<br />

				I find this hard to believe as i would have thought that most of the vendors come from very different areas. If SR was the vendor then I would say you may have a point. perhaps you are just doing to much

				Please note the parts where I repeatedly said that I was not just doing too much. I have been an opiate user for more than a year. I know what it feels like to do too much of an opiate. This is not the issue. I&#039;ve had batches where I got nauseas, had a headache and generally felt shitty before my pupils were pinned. Some vendors seem to sell H that is actually clean, like smile awhile and Northern Dancer. Their H is strong, but it feels &quot;clean&quot;. I can get so high I throw up, but I still feel great. SuperTrips and Frankmatthews both have dope that gives me this terrible feeling. After snorting, I feel excellent for about 10 minutes, and then I start feeling incredibly nauseas, I get a headache and I feel this fever-like sensation.

				Do you have any sort of evidence rather than just accusations....?<br />have you brought this up with any (apparently all on SR...) of the vendors that you&#039;re accusing?<br /><br />It&#039;s one hell of a statement to make the heading of this thread &#039;Re: The majority of SR heroin cut with this super nasty active ingredient&#039; and if I were a vendor where this was in fact untrue, I would feel quite insulted. That&#039;s my two cents.

I can assure you that it IS a cut. I&#039;ve been using opiates for more than a year, and I know perfectly well what it feels like to simply do too much of an opiate. This is not what&#039;s happening. Aswell as this, it only happens with some batches. With smile awhile(I use this vendor as an example because he has the strongest H) I do not get this bad feeling, despite his product being the strongest I&#039;ve ever tried, so I repeat: It&#039;s not an issue of me doing too much. I also just got confirmation from another user on another opiate board; someone who&#039;s had this experience aswell, and not just with SR vendors.

				Ive had some H like this in my neck of the woods. Matter of fact i had some recently. I recall getting a really bad head ache, nausea, and more or less a fever. Ive been into h for 3 years now and ive only had shit like this once. im not aware if you shoot it or however you do it but shooting it is how ive done it and lets just say it wasn&#039;t worth it.

				I would love to know where you have been scoring this past year, i have been using H for a little under 20 years and am blown away by the quality of some of the gear on the road. <br /><br />also all gear is cut, you could not chase if it was pure.

This means that every other person will not have your symptoms, but you do. The vendor can do little about it, frankly. <br />Frankly speaking every person is allergic to some specific chemicals, even if they don&#039;t know it yet. It can take years to find out.
