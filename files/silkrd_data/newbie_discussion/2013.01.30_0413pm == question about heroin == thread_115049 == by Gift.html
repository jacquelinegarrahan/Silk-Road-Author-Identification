				Color really doesn&#039;t define the difference in the numbers. #4 can be tan, brown, gray, white, etc. <br /><br />China white is classified as #4.

				#3 Heroin refers to a base Heroin, usually it is smoked, it can be IVed and snorted but you must add a citric acid of some type. Black tar and #3 are not the same thing. Black tar actually is a &quot;crude&quot; process that doesn&#039;t really fall into the #3/#4 category, as it has it&#039;s own refinement process. Black Tar is Black Tar.<br /><br />#4 Heroin is processed to a salt Heroin HCL, and is probably considered the &quot;purest&quot; and most refined of the Heroins. Now Among #4 you have Colombian Brown, Afghan brown, and then China White. <br /><br />Now here&#039;s the deal 99% of the stuff being called China White on SR(or real life) isn&#039;t China White, it&#039;s Afghan or Colombian Brown with a cutting agent(many say Fentanyl)making it whitish in color. As far as I know the only true China White being sold on SR is coming from Smiles Awhile and he is not based in the USA.<br /><br />China White only comes from a particular area in Southeast Asian called the Golden Triangle, Burma, Laos, Thailand etc.. This is where #4 China White is produced, and rarely seen in the U.S. . True China white is considered the purest most refined of all the Heroins. It for all intents and purposes looks like a high quality cocaine, as it is light fluffy and pure white.<br /><br />Go read the reviews of Smiles Awhile and see how glowing they are.

				The #3 I have seen has been a brown powder. I think it&#039;s FrankMathews or another Euro vendor that sells #3. On a side note many say you can just snort #3 as ou nose is acidic enough to make it work. I have no experience with this and can&#039;t vouch for the validity of this claim.

				Got to go along with Mr.Lavish, that certainly some knowledge you got there. China white was about years ago, only form the golden triangle, or emerald triangle. It was a byword for quality H from where I live. But couldn&#039;t get hold of it nowhere, untill the worlds supply was opened up to me. Years ago only the hardest local gangsters and the well connected could source this quality Brown.<br /><br />Now we are free to purchase quality swag, Thats what I call service to the masses. Long live SR!!!!! :-X
