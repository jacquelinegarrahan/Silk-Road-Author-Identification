				Just thought I would preface this with the fact that I&#039;m an opiate-light individual,&nbsp; but have dabbled with various doses of weak opiates/oids including hydrocodone, codeine and kratom.<br />The largest does I ever took of hydrocodone was only 30mg, and I&#039;ve been taking kratom on a regular basis for the past month or so.<br /><br />I decided to purchase heroin from a top rated vendor, just one stamp, just to give the drug a go and see what it offered. This was mostly based on it&#039;s reputation of being the &quot;hardest&quot; of hard drugs, and my previous enjoyment of other opiates, all of which had given me nothing but positive experiences.<br />I recieve my stamp of heroin, and in a state of pure giddy do a line of 10mg.<br />It hits me rapidly, but instead of the deep, intense euphoria I expected, I just felt numb and disoriented. <br /><br />Fast forward an hour and I still felt very meh. The effects were definitely strong, but felt very boring and less euphoric than any other opiate i&#039;ve ever taken, even kratom, which I took 2 days previously, and on many other occasions.<br />I decide after an hour and a half to bump another 10mg, and once again, no good euphoria, just more heaviness.<br />I get into a &quot;nod&quot;, but it doesn&#039;t feel good at all like when i nodded on hydros, which felt fucking amazing.<br />An hour after the second line, I start feeling nauseous and shitty, which continued for a half hour or so, so i decided to just lay down with my eyes closed to ride it out. <br /><br />I end up just falling asleep, and I wake up with a nasty headache an hour later.<br />I decide to eat and grab a slice of pizza, which I promtly vomit up after feeling some incredibly awful nausea.<br />I&#039;m now back to feeling OK, but I&#039;m spaced the fuck out and not exactly pleasant.<br />Why did heroin do absolutely nothing for me, when I love other opiates like hydro that are considered &quot;weak&quot;?<br />I guess this is a blessing, since I don&#039;t ever plan on re-doing heroin any time soon, but it kinda sucks that I didn&#039;t get the euphoria everyone raves about.<br /><br />If anyone has suggestions for another opiate to try (i.e oxy or dilaudid), please let me know, because heroin did not leave me a happy camper.

				Take a shower, smoke a tiny bit of weed. Breathe consciously, slowly and deeply. Take an asprin, drink some caffeine.&nbsp; <br />This is just general advise for stopping hangover like effects.

				This sounds fairly typical of a non opiod tolerant user trying a strong opiate like Heroin.&nbsp; Your puking is a result of the strength of the opiate overwhelming your body, which in turn overrides any euphoria you would receive from it.&nbsp; As was said, some people just can&#039;t handle strong opiates/opiods - this is a shielding light shining down from above telling you it&#039;s not for you.&nbsp; Someone above asked what is worse: H or Meth - this is a very subjective question.&nbsp; In terms of long term health risks, Meth is much more toxic on many parts of the body (Before and after pictures of Meth addicts - hello?).&nbsp; Heroin on the other hand, or any strong opiod/opiate, is different in that, as long as you have the opiate, you can maintain fairly decent health using safe administration precautions.&nbsp; However, when you don&#039;t have the opiate (this happens as much as you do have it) the withdrawal or &quot;dope sickness&quot; is a debilitating feeling that is the absolute worst, and seriously causes you to shutdown mentally and physically.&nbsp; I have been off Heroin for almost 7 years, but am now on MMT, and let me tell you, any strong opiate use, will lead to addiction.&nbsp; Your story is pretty much the same as every other opiate addict - start with opiod pills, take more to get higher, and eventually want to go to the next step.&nbsp; You, however are lucky in that you jumped strengths too quickly, and this could be what saves the rest of your life if you listen to your heart.<br /><br />Any opiate users that want to watch a good movie of the life of many of us addicts - check out the movie Oxymorons on Netflix.&nbsp; This movie is based on a true story that depicts the progress of almost every opiate addict&#039;s progression in addiction.

				Heroin is very touch and go, esp here on SR.<br /><br />Who did you get this stamp from? <br /><br />Ive been using H here on SR for some time now, and have only been &#039;wowed&#039; by DeluxeDelivery. Thats not to say that others have great dope, just that its all very different. Most of the H ive gotten here though, is as you described. As I and another memeber discussed, ill often end up doing more than i need, looking for that rush and just end up passing out waking up a few hours later all silly feeling from such shallow breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				you&#039;ve done too much for a first time user. the first time i used it was a ten bag(.1) between about 5 or 6 of us and i was flying on the best buzz i ever had. <br /><br />nausea is common if you&#039;ve done too much. don&#039;t try to eat or drink and if you feel like puking then go puke. you&#039;ll prolly notice very watery spit flood your mouth just before you&#039;re about to puke. puking always makes you feel better when you&#039;ve taken too much. don&#039;t try to drink or eat after tho, just rinse your mouth out to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />next time don&#039;t use so much, you can always top up your dose but its impossible to untake it.<br /><br />btw did you inject??<br /><br />you might want to try chasing it on foil for your first use. its certainly a lot safer that way.<br /><br />i should also add that it is very common for first time users to get nauseous, don&#039;t be put off. and heroin isn&#039;t the evil drug that its portrayed to be. a lot of misinformation is out there about it. for one its non-tissue toxic. that means it does not cause any harm or damage to the body. the only danger from using it is overdosing, which can be eliminated by smoking it.

				Too much with no tolerance, I don&#039;t condone heroin use, being a recovering addict myself and having half my family still torn apart from the drug.<br /><br />With no tolerance Heroin will do one of two things, kill you or make you very ill, by that I mean drowsiness, headaches, vomiting, itching.. this will no doubt go on for a day or two im afraid!<br /><br />Just be grateful your still alive! Im assuming you smoked it which is why you are...<br /><br />If you carry on using it eventually your body will &quot;get&quot; it and those side effects stop, but then your well onto the road for destruction, tread it carefully my friend!<br /><br />

				Dude I did something similar with Crystal Meth recently, never done it, never even seen it. Ordered 1g of the lab grade stuff, did a phat line, didn&#039;t feel much, or at least not what I was expecting, tried smoking some, ended up doing it all to myself in an evening...<br /><br />Didn&#039;t sleep / eat for 4 days, drove me insane, if someone could of given me H at that stage I would of taken it, anything to get some sleep..<br /><br />Live and learn bro, if a well established substance has a bad rep, its usually for a pretty good reason ;)

				Yeah Heroin is fickle man, it only ever made sense to me IV, ive sniffed it and smoked it but it doesnt give you the hit your lead to believe H does that way, that only comes from IV, and for me that has to be a cocktail of H and Coke / Crack, for me I crossed that line and there is no going back, why I don&#039;t really do it anymore, I could never smoke / sniff it again and enjoy it I don&#039;t think, and IV has ruined my veins and given me Hep C.<br /><br />Ive never done mg of H, but smoking it .1g of good stuff is a standard dose first time, it will still no doubt make you sick though 60mg over a day does not sound like it would do much to anyone, certainly not me!
