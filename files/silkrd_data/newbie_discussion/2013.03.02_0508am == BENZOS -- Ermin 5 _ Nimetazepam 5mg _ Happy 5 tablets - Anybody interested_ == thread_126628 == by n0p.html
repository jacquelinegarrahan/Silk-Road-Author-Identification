				I have a wholesale source for Nimetazepam 5mg tablets and might start selling on SR so I want to gauge interest. It is pretty much the # 1 drug of choice in Singapore and Malaysia and is highly used in Taiwan and Japan but it has never been on the prescription market in the States or in the EU to my knowledge probably due to widespread abuse in Asia. The molecule was also patented by Mitsubishi pharmaceutical (Japan) so that might also be a factor.<br /><br /><br />So anybody interested??????<br /><br /><br /><br />Ermin 5 or Nimetazepam 5mg (Happy 5 or P5 are some street-names)<br /><br />Systematic (IUPAC) name<br />2-methyl-9-nitro-6-phenyl-<br />2,5-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeca-5,8,10,12-tetraen-3-one<br />Routes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral<br />Pharmacokinetic data<br />Bioavailability&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95%<br />Metabolism&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatic<br />Half-life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14-30 hours<br />Excretion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renal<br /><br />Nimetazepam (marketed under brand name Erimin) is an intermediate-acting hypnotic drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It was first synthesized by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in 1962.[1] It possesses hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Nimetazepam is also an anticonvulsant.[2] It is sold in 5 mg tablets known as Erimin. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep.<br /><br /><br />Taken orally, nimetazepam has very good bioavailability with nearly 100% being absorbed from the gut. It is among the most rapidly absorbed and quickest acting oral benzodiazepines, and hypnotic effects are typically felt within 15–30 minutes after oral ingestion. The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short half-life ranging from 0.5-0.7 hours and the terminal half-life from 8–26.5 hours (mean 17.25 hours).[citation needed] It is the N-methylated analogue of nitrazepam (Mogadon, Alodorm), to which it is partially metabolised. Nitrazepam has a long elimination half-life, so effects of repeated dosage tend to be cumulative.<br /><br /><br />Recreational use<br /><br />Nimetazepam has a reputation in Malaysia for being particularly subject to abuse especially by persons addicted to amphetamines or opiates.

				Hey man I&#039;ve been looking for this for a while, its a shame nobody else replied on this seeing there isnt much demand on it. I want to get my hands on it, making a sellers account might be expensive for you for one person, if you do have an account though let me know I will buy some. I would like to know what is the price of one in GBP? Please inbox me, I rarely come on maybe we could work things out together, would really wish to try it. Thanks, Nexi
