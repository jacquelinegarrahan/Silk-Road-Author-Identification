				So i&#039;ve made my first purchase on SR from MrCronk (reputable ganj seller) and everyone seems to Finalise before they recieve the goods and everything runs smoothly. On his T&#039;s and C&#039;s he says that you must (god knows why) finalise early so I have done.<br /><br />Any reasons why? I thought SR tried to stop sellers doing that? <br /><br />cheers

				I&#039;ve never bought or sold on the market, but from what I understand you should never FE (finalize early).<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty certain it&#039;s against the rules for vendors to require early finalization.<br /><br />Best of luck to you.

				NO, FFS, NO!! You might not get screwed, but FFS, I&#039;ve been here a week and only JUST placed my first order, but if there&#039;s anything I learned in that week, it&#039;s that you NEVER finalize early! You &quot;can,&quot; but that&#039;s like fronting to a complete stranger. &quot;Yeah, man, yeah. I got the FIYA back at my homie&#039;s house, but you gotta front the bread first, right?&quot; &quot;Um, no thanks, dude. I&#039;ll keep looking.&quot; You would NEVER do this on the street, so why would you do it here? Besides, I&#039;m a nervous wreck just with my money sitting in escrow at an illegal, underground, drug-dealing website.&nbsp; :-\

				I&#039;m new myself but I&#039;ve read everywhere to never FE.<br /><br />I think there are a few reputable vendors on here for green that don&#039;t require FE,<br /><br />I read somewhere that SR suggests doing everything with escrow because one you release the funds(FE) its basically out of their hands if they need to step in to resolve something.

				Just my 2 cents. I am a newbie &amp; I don&#039;t believe you should ever FE. There are plenty of reputable weed vendors who don&#039;t require FE. Browse these boards, especially the rumor mill and you will get plenty of reviews of vendors. There is a ton of info. on here as to why you should never ever FE. Hope all goes well.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I will only finalize early if I see at least a few people on the forum giving them positive feedback, as well as them having a very high vendor feedback score obviously. A lot of people never do it and that&#039;s a much better idea, but it can be hard to avoid sometimes though especially if you are new(not really for buying weed though there is tons of that available). <br /><br />One of my first purchases was going to be from CaliMeds, some cheeba chews with free express shipping for finalizing early. They had 100% positive feedback and plenty of it so I didn&#039;t see the risk. Turns out it was all fake rep built up in stealth mode and they ended up scamming tons of people.

				if this is your first purchase or you have a highish refund rate, then you could probably understand why vendors are asking for FE<br /><br />Just like vendors have been scamming buyers with FE, there have been a lot of people scamming vendors with escrow claiming their package never arrived when it did and then getting a reship/refund. I think if its your FIRST purchase you might want to consider FE from a very reputable vendor but beyond that, there should really be no need to FE.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s not against the rules for vendors to ask for FE, only vendors who have had their accounts for less than 3 months can&#039;t ask for FE. Unless the rules changed...

				Don&#039;t do it, plenty of people have been scammed by FE requests. Will a vendor who requires FE always scam? nope. But is it alot easier to scam when you FE? Hell yes. There are plenty of vendors out there, shop around and if you&#039;re buying a volume you would not be happy never arriving then don&#039;t FE. You gotta figure out if it&#039;s worth the risk.<br /><br />Basically I was scammed last month by lucydrop, wasn&#039;t fun :(

				The Mod gave you the technical definition and purpose of FE.&nbsp; Still use your common sense.&nbsp; It&#039;s a free market and you have the freedom to do whatever you want with your money!&nbsp; Try to treat SR as if you were buying in the street.&nbsp; Would you give a random dealer on the street money and hope he comes back in a few days with your shit?&nbsp; On the flip side some of you may have trusted dealers in your personal lives that you operate like this with.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about trust in the dealer/vendor, no matter who they are!&nbsp; Every case is different, just do your homework!

				Don&#039;t FE go with a trusted vendor that takes the risk to track the package so that they are willing to fuck with noobies since if you try to scam them (bad karma!) they can prove to the resolution center that the package was sent out. I&#039;d recommend HeartofHumboldt it only took me two days to recieve he answers very fast and the packaging and stealth is top-notch.

				The only time I finalized early was when I bought 2 things from the same vendor, and one came in.<br />I had good faith in the vendor that he had sent the other thing, and the price of BTC was falling down, so I FEd so he could get the most of it.

				Maybe your vendor is reputablet. Nothing personal with him but if he did scam you he wouldn&#039;t be the first vendor with hundredths of transactions and flawless record to one day just bail and run with everyone&#039;s FE money. Just happened last week with TopShelf and he got away with a substantial amount of money.

				Don&#039;t FE. If you&#039;re in the US, there are plenty of weed vendors who will do business with you in escrow.&nbsp; For some drugs, it&#039;s harder to find in-escrow vendors who will work with new buyers, but there&#039;s so much weed on here, that you shouldn&#039;t have a problem, unless you&#039;re trying to buy bulk.
