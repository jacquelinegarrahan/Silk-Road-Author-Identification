				Is there a way where I can buy with a credit card or using online banking or something?<br />This seems way more complicated than it should be. I will go to the bank if I really have to but I&#039;m curious if there&#039;s an easier option. Mtgox requires all this identification to &quot;verify&quot; yourself which is bullshit.<br />

				you trying to be anonymous or whats the goal ?<br /><br />Whats wrong with taking out some cash and going into bank to deposit into spendbitcoins or one of those places ? I reckon its one of the least complicated / fasted methods around.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think many places like accepting CC due to the charge backs. <br />

				You can check out e-forexgold into a liberty reserve account and then into mtgox or some shit. Was a bit of a fuck around though. If you want me to provide u with the exact method, let me know it&#039; aint that hard.<br /><br />I used to do it that way, worked fine.<br /><br />Now days I don&#039;t do drugs nor use SR. I am just going to try and start to educate young people on how they should do as much drugs as they can so they build a tolerance and then need more in quantity but not just that we want young drug users to continue on their way so they seek the most purest form of their drug they are addicted too.<br /><br />ABC

				You manage to connect to the Tor server, encrypt sensitive communication, anonymously purchase, wash and use coins to shop for and receive prohibited substances without the hassle or hazard of dealing with dodgy local dealers with substandard product, all in the safety, comfort and luxury&nbsp; of your padded comfy computer chair, couch or bed and you whinge about walking a couple metres into a bank to fund to this unlikely, outrageously NON physical venture??? <br /><br />Shhhhhhhiiiitttttttttttt.... <br />Get..
