				Alright sure, most of us know Silk Road has been under a ddos attack for quite some time now...but does anyone know who is behind the attack? Or why? I mean ddosing seems kinda below law enforcement tactics... so who is doing this? Competition? Atlantis seems to be running fine...

				Whoever is doing it had better remain anonymous. They are fucking up big business and are going to get a 25 cent hair cut if they get found out.

				Of course it isn&#039;t LE. They aren&#039;t going to ddos. DDoS is quite simple for many people who have access to a botnet. The reason? We can only speculate.

				I hope we find out who is behind the attack, then Tessellated can take down the attacker like he took down the scamming site bitcointalks.&nbsp; Thanks again for doing that Tess, it was the highlight of my week&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Here is the link to the thread for the true newibes <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109831.0

				I heard that alot of darknet sites including ours were getting threatened by hackers that they would DDOS their sites if they dont comply with them and give them bitcoins for DDOS protection and supposedly thats the reason alot of tor sites including tormail was down last week...<br />whether this is true or not is a different story but we can only speculate at this point..

It is still continuing, but it is now much worse than yesterday. The lag times have increased and will probably get worse over the course of today as people realise they cannot simply log out and then log back in again and the online members increase.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even access my own thread I started yesterday just after the attacks commenced as the page simply won&#039;t load.<br /><br />But seriously.... it could be anyone, most certainly including LE. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Could be the people behind Atlantis (new competition).<br />Could be LE - they&#039;re not one global outfit so different strategies may be employed, even if it gets in the way of each other!<br />Could be Anonymous.<br />Could be just about anyone.<br /><br />But the forums are also under attack, no? It&#039;s been very difficult to get in here.
