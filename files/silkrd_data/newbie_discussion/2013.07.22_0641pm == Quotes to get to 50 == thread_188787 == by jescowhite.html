				We have had a mind-programming exercising, thats called &quot;the war on drugs&quot; for the last 40 years, which has been designed to create an internal enemy in our societies and convince people that there are these evil, wicked groups who are doing these terrible, sinful things smoking these drugs and doing this and that. A very dark image has been created around this and people get very upset irrationally about this whole issue. And actually what&#039;s been forgotten in all of this, is that when the state sends us to prison for essentially exploring our own consciousness. This is an grotesque abuse of human rights. It&#039;s a fundamental wrong if I as an adult am not sovereign over my own consciousness then I&#039;m absolutely not sovereign over anything. I can&#039;t claim any kind of freedom at all and what has happen over the last 40 or 50 years under the disguise of the war on drugs, is that we have been persuaded to hand over the keys of our consciousness to the state. The most precious, the most intimate, the most sapient part of ourselves, the state now has the key and Furthermore! They have persuaded us that thats in our interests. This is a very dangerous situation.<br />~Graham Hancock~

				I believe we are a species with amnesia, I think we have forgotten our roots and our origins. I think we are quite lost in many ways. And we live in a society that invests huge amounts of money and vast quantities of energy in ensuring that we all stay lost. A society that invests in creating unconsciousness, which invests in keeping people asleep so that we are just passive consumers or products and not really asking any of the questions.<br />~Graham Hancock~

In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.” <br /><br />“Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming &quot;Wow!

I saw all these threads trying to get to 50 with just number counts etc, so i thought id try and make it a little more fun/interesting, at least for me, writing a number every post is a little boring rather than reposting some interesting quotes, hope that answers your question as to whey these things are posted~

				Humanity is taking a forward step from the cradle stories of the former generation and their individuality and spiritual discernment of the consciousness of the generation that is fast approaching. Delusions, traditions, and superstitions are nearing the end. It is also true of the civilization which they established. The old idols are good enough for the infantile consciousness that is nearing an impasse.<br />Their delusion has caused their undoing as they proved to be only cradle stories woven by a mastercraft of priesthood and preceptor to lull into false sleep the crying infants of an evolving race. Those who saw further afield did not cry and thus were not lulled to sleep. Most of them saw that the cradle stories were not true and many stepped boldly forth to erase the untruth; as they saw directly through to the Absolute, that which has always existed and which has always been seen an and known and contacted directly by a portion of mankind. From this portion there will arise a new and more vitalizing consciousness, fully awake and ready to erase the idols that man has set up for his fellow man to follow and make room for the new ideals which are as old as creation’s dawn.<br /><br />The awakening tiger of higher intelligence and spirituality will refuse to sleep again, as it is already ravaged with the fragments of the past and disappointed with the torture of misplaced confidence. It will demand a stronger and more vital thought with instruction based on Truth itself.<br /><br />Another cycle of spirit is dawning for the whole world. Another age of the Crystal Race is coming up out of the maelstrom. This race does not hesitate to strip the swaddling clothes of delusion from the whole human race~<br />-Masters of the Far East by Baird Spalding
