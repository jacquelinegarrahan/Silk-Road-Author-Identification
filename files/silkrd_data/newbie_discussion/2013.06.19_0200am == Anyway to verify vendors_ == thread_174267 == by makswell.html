				Hi guys, I&#039;ve only been here a month but am having no lick so far with vendors. I received my first order after FE&#039;ing but it turned out to be utter shit.&nbsp; Next vendor asks for an extra $50 for shipping and nothing turns up. I&#039;m now down around $400 and think just randomly picking vendors doesn&#039;t work (for me at least). <br /><br />Any advice for picking vendors?

First, if you FE, you forfeit your right to resolve any issues with the vendor with Silk Road staff. This is your biggest insurance against scams, don&#039;t squander it. Next, the forums have everything you could wish to read on nearly every vendor, and if they don&#039;t, then start a thread. Vendors with a forum presence are extra reliable. LSD and MDMA quality and purity are tested independently by the LSD and MDMA Avengers groups (look for their threads). There are massive threads reviewing cocaine, heroin, speed. Research research research! Talk to vendors before buying, ask them questions you have. Notice if they&#039;re courteous or if they&#039;re assholes. Notice if they&#039;re bullying you into finalizing early. <br /><br />You got the power bud, use it and you will have many happy transactions.

				Thanks for both replies. I understand I could put a complaint in and try and have it resolved but I&#039;m reluctant to given they have my drop details. &quot;Research, research, research&quot;&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll start trying to find the threads I need to do this.&nbsp; Much appreciated!

				Research, research, research, indeed!<br />I&#039;m still in the nuts-and-bolts, how-does-it-all-work phase of research. Getting BitCoin is next, then I will scour the forums for info revealing a trust-worthy vendor for my favorite psychadelics.<br /><br />...damn, this is fun. I&#039;d hate to ruin it by getting scammed the first time. That really sucks, man.

				Not all vendors are equal...advice here is sound...do your background checks...talk to people like me (I&#039;m approachable and professional) then depending on your need you may get the right supplier.<br />Cheers<br />Doc
