				Just did my first transaction ever with BitFloor.<br /><br />So far, so good.&nbsp; I had spent a week waiting for BitInstant&#039;s website to put their form back up last month, then went on vacation and came back this past weekend to them being down AGAIN but even worse.. it seems they&#039;ve now removed their bitcoin address option.&nbsp; Essentially, I&#039;m done messing with them.<br /><br />BitFloor sent me the amount to deposit to BoA, I did so and the funds were there before I was even back home.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently tumbling them around accounts before I pass them off to SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to finally have made it this far.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been researching and attempting for too long.

				Only quirk I had with bitfloor was how they had things setup. But i agree. They look promising, granted I have only used them once.<br />And OP:<br />There are plenty of ways to stay a little more anonymous than ebay. Dont do that. Just dont. Dear god. Dont.

				Just do wire transfer from your bank straight to mtgox, its much cheaper that way and rather fast.

				if you buy from here, prepare to get scammed. there&#039;s nothing illegal about buying bitcoins so just buy them legit and use a tumbler.
