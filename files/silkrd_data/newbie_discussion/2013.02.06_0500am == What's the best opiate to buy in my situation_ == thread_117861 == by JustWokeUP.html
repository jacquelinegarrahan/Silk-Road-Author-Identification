				Hey guys I&#039;m looking for a little guidance here - I&#039;m looking for a good opiate to buy and get high on. I&#039;m a very non-frequent user (maybe once a month usually less), I don&#039;t want to just be high all the time I just really enjoy taking an occasional day off and indulging in opiate-bliss.<br /><br />I know it doesn&#039;t make sense being a non-frequent user but I have done a fair bit of opiates in the past (all pills, oxy, hydro, opana, methadone once) and I find a good dose range for me is like around 60-80mg of oxycodone. (I know this seems high for seemingly having no tolerance but, hey, I think permanent tolerance is a real thing for me).<br /><br />I was thinking of getting some suboxone (buprenorphine w/ naloxone) but can&#039;t seem to get a straight answer on whether it will get a non-frequent (very non-frequent) non-opiate dependent user high. Does it? Should i go for something else like a heroin stamp bag? (never tried heroin).<br /><br />Like I said I&#039;m really looking for like just one good dose of opiates I can enjoy on a random day and 8mg of bup converts to like 160-200mg of morphine right? so maybe if I cut the slip in half? Should I splurge on a fentanyl patch? (obviously I&#039;d be very careful and cut it up)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!&nbsp; :)

				Shameless bump (also if you&#039;re wondering the reason I don&#039;t want to just buy that amount of oxy is that it seems like I can get the same thing for aloot less unless im mistaken...)

				Seriously, you should avoid bup in my opinion, but Ive never had it.&nbsp; Just seems that anything at 8mg being equal to 160-180mg morphine doesnt sound right.&nbsp; I was on opium for 2 years then methadone3 years, up to 149mg methadone.&nbsp; If I were to go back, I would go with the powder H, price seems right enough.&nbsp; I just know that if I get back on that bus, its a terminal commitment.&nbsp; Things may be different for you.<br />halleo

				Maybe, I&#039;m going by the (possibly not accurate) wiki opioid conversion which says that like oxycodone is 2x the power of morphine 90% oral bioavailibilty and bup is 40x with 40% bioavailibilty, rough calculations to be sure.<br /><br />The thing is I don&#039;t want to IV ne thing, what would I do with powder H? snort it? I like to just be able to eat things lol&nbsp; :D

				Umm...... its your choice? Personal preference since youve tried various ones and know you can handle them. Opiates are opiates

				Get some powder H. Be careful because opiates are known to cause addiction even when you don&#039;t realize it

				Avoid the suboxone. Bupe with the naloxone included has almost zero recreational use. A very non frequent user with absolutely no tolerance to opiates may get a buzz from it but trust me its not what you&#039;re looking for. Suboxone is an opiate blocker, but is a strong opiate as well. But the naloxone will bind to your receptors and block the opiates from taking effect. I&#039;m currently on suboxone, treating addiction to heroin. So be careful with opiates, especially if you decide on getting some H. Addiction sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you&#039;re no longer using to get high. You&#039;re using just to get normal. And that is a horrible lifestyle. End of my rant.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />As much as I hate to recommend heroin to anyone. Thats the best bang for your buck in my opinion.

				Suboxone is def not the way to go IMO for a good opiate high on your schedule. I would suggest some good #4 heroin. If I may offer a suggestion SupremeSmoke has really nice #4 heroin in the US. 30mg will have you blasted out of your mind for 3-4 hours easily and I have yet to come across a better deal. I am a very non frequent user of opiates as well and 250mg lasted me a month. :D

				There is no high from suboxone. It is NOT 160X stronger, is has that much affinity to bind with receptors keeping other opiates from attaching. It is mostly used to help withdraws from opiates..

				On a similair note, I want to try opiates. What would be the best to begin with?<br />I was thinking of opium poppies and making them into tea.

				I would suggest maybe a simple oxycodone like 20mg for a noob. I have tried a wide range and I feel like script wise its the way to go. If you are ordering off SR then just go with H. Going with opium tea just seems like a waste of money to me in the long run. Just do less heroin and not get as high.<br />

				Thanks for the replies, I tried opium tea once and I got *FUUUUUCKED* but I drank way too much. There&#039;s all these different kinds of natural opiates and other nasty chemicals in the pure opium pods though that will really mess with your body, wouldn&#039;t recommend it if you have access to other stuff a la road.

				Bupe/Subutex was a miracle drug for me, but not to get high. If you get stuck on Brown or whatever it can definitely help you get off if you slowly taper.<br />If you&#039;ve never done H and can get some good stuff then great. For me smoking Brown on foil is my favourite as I don&#039;t IV anymore but if you want something a bit cleaner maybe a few Vicodin 500/10 or Norco 325/10 are the best? You&#039;re pretty unlucky if you have a tolerance of 60-80mg with barely any use! <br />If Norco won&#039;t do it for you Oxycontin are a better bet than Bupe. If you&#039;ve never done it before Bupe might make you feel a bit dizzy but it&#039;s not the high you&#039;re looking for! Save it for if you get into trouble, which I hope you don&#039;t.
