				If you&#039;re just pissing in a bag and selling it, nobody is going to buy it. They could just get a friend&#039;s piss.<br /><br />If you&#039;re selling one of those kits that are designed to pass drug tests, then people might buy it, although I don&#039;t think those are illegal so you&#039;ve have to compete against clearnet prices.

				O,P listen if you want to pass a test swerve buying it , get a drug free friend to urinate in a urinal test tube, ask you doctor reception or any walk in centre, then you get a drug free sympathetic friend and get him to piddle in it half hour before, then this is the key, you have to put the tube under your arm and keep it body temp, any colder and the test will flag up as inconclusive, Then just slip the urine in the tub your provided for the test and watch their faces when you show them your glazed but nothings coming up...I doubt some of the gear on here would show up anyway lol.

It is one thing to get scammed for your moneypak, because money is replaceable. But to lose your job, or worse; get your parole or probation revoked because your trusting joe schmo&#039;s pee that came in the fucking mail? Your freedom and job are not as easily replaced as money is.
