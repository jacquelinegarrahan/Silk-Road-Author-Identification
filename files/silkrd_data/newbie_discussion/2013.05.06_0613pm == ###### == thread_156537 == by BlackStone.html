				As you noticed after careful consideration, we hired a new moderator.&nbsp; I feel Scout has been a excellent employee always on the forums as instructed.&nbsp; We feel he wil be part of SR for a long time to come.&nbsp; SSBD is good, but not as reliable, so I&#039;m leaving it up to you to feel what is appropiate to do, keep him or let him go.&nbsp; I don&#039;t micromanage so if you need help or anything you can contact me.&nbsp; I will be busy for a while so do what you think is good for the company, and as long as you don&#039;t get any instructions from me do as you like.&nbsp; Remember&nbsp; moderators must be on forums at all times. To all the dealers you are the best also thank you for&nbsp; your hardwork and being dedicated employees to to RD.(Pizzas on me). LOL Thank you and did&#039;nt mean to threaten to fire you(DPR).

				Can one of the mds make sure the forums are used witihn the SR guidelines.&nbsp; As much as I find some people on the forums amusing and this is a freedom to talk, somethings are there for a purpose and not to be abused.&nbsp; I know Mods are here and want some amusement(who does&#039;nt but don&#039;t let the forums get out of hand). SR is all about having fun.&nbsp; I am too a new hire to SR and know this can be handled by emailing a mod to fix it, but like to show who I am in the beggining. And I am real nice but somebody has to keep order. Thank you and Love SR and the Community, everybody please be safe and don&#039;t do something if you think its not right to do, I&#039;m not your Daddy or your Momma so, do as you thinnk is good for you and nobody else.&nbsp; I sound corny but to all have a goodnight, don&#039;t like to make speechs but sometimes it is necessary. Thank you SR community.
