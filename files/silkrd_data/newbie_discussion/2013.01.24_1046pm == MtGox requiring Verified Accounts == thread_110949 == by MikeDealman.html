				Starting May 25th,&nbsp; if you are a user of Dwolla it will be required you verify your Mtgox.com account.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little concerned for my anonymity, should I be?

				You could just use bitinstant. You can make your cash deposit at any walmart using a blue money gram order. That goes through almost instantly and then you have the funds in your Mtgox account

				Buying bitcoins is completely legal, so I wouldn&#039;t be worried about them knowing who you are. It depends tho, do you believe LE in your country have the time to investigate everyone who buys bitcoins? If not then they would only know you buy bitcoins when they&#039;ve already caught you for something.

				Go to walmart. Use a fake name and address.<br /><br />I did this, came up with an addy off the top of my head.

				Getting verified means linking your bank account. I don&#039;t care how legal bitcoins are I say its bad idea to go that route.

				@MikeDealman<br /><br />No you can not deposit BTC at/with walmart...You can use walmart to send $$ to your Mtgox account[i think first you send the money to DWOLLA and from there to Mtgox]...<br />We send from our bank account money to a&nbsp; Mtgox bank account. When we make this payment we attach to this payment a unique code[this code is unique for every Mtgox account] which tell Mtgox to send the money to our account. When we receive the funds we can buy BTC from Mtgox market which is very easy. You just place an order with the average price in that moment and you have your BTC in minutes in your wallet.<br />Yes it is Ok to be verified by Mtgox. You can be sure nobody try to scam you in this way

Follow these instructions:<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.

				MTGOX requires verification before you can touch the coins in your account. They require both ID and proof of residency. They won&#039;t accept pictures from iphones, must be scans. They won&#039;t accept utility bills more than 3 months old. They are dead serious about the process. It also takes a significant amount of time. Don&#039;t expect to create an MTGOX account one day, fund it, and then immediately start moving coins around. I would expect at least a weeks time. I&#039;m starting to become a bit weary of Gox. For holding your savings, their cold storage account is great. But for coins you want to move around quickly and often they are becoming very difficult to deal with in a timely manner.
