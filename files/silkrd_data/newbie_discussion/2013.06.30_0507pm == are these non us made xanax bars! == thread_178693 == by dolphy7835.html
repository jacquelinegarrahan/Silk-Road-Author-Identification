				xanax(usa made) bars seem a little off compared to photos found on line. Font looks suspiciously large on xanax leters and the 2 seems too be a little far below the scores on back. Def has alprazolam in them, but the edges seem a little more boxy than google photos i&#039;ve seen. Cant use pc right now, just my phone for comparisons, so maybe that&#039;s the problem. Trying to be optimistic here, but compared to the yellow bars i took the other day, there seems to be a differnce in effect, albeit small. Any experts out there could help? Don&#039;t wanna rush to conclusions so fast, because has been reall cool with me. 3 times i pmed moneypak for bitcoin and transaction was done in 10 minutes. If these are foreign then i need to call im on this and send a message. If they are generic. What would be fair for me to ask for by him to make up for this! Btw: i&#039;m not a piece of shit scammer who just wants free drugs. I have 0 refund as well as autofinalization record. Thanks

				If they&#039;re marked Xanax 2 they aren&#039;t supposed to be foreign. Unfortunately there are a lot of fakes right now, so if you have the money you can send one off to be analyzed.
