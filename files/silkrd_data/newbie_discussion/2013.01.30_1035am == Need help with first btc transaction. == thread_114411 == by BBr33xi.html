				I have been lurking on SR for a long time trying to figure things out for myself before actually doing any transactions, and i think i know the basics of how btc works and everything, so i just wanted some helpful info on whether or not i should be able to do this without losing $$$.<br /><br />1) Downloaded TOR Browser <br />2) registered at SR<br />3) have my bitcoin wallet set up and synced with the btc network<br />4) have backed up my bitcoin wallet and saved the .dat file on a usb<br /><br />So now i think i&#039;m ready to buy some bitcoins; which is where i&#039;ve been confused for some time now. I have found some sites to buy the coins from, but i don&#039;t really understand how the transfer works, which i need simply elaborated for me. in the wallet there&#039;s recieve coins, and when i click that tab it has an address and i&#039;ve heard every transaction where i&#039;m receiving btc that i should make a new address for each. <br />i&#039;m assuming when i buy some bitcoins i will just provide one of these addresses and the bitcoins will be automatically deposited in my bitcoin wallet; but how would this work if there was more than one user on my desktop? is there only one wallet for my whole computer? i assume that there is. i just don&#039;t want to get the btc sent to a wallet that isn&#039;t the one i&#039;m trying to get the btc deposited into.<br /><br />after i sort through actually getting the btc, all i&#039;ll need to do is upload the coin to my SR account for purchases, is this correct?<br /><br />if no one feels like they can help me, just tell me and i&#039;ll try to explain what i need help with better; i know i probably sound lost, but i have been trying to learn the ins and outs for months now and just want to buy stuff now!

				You don&#039;t have to use an actual wallet on your PC, you can use a web wallet such as the reputable instawallet.org and easywallet.org, when you visit either site you automatically get a wallet link and an actual wallet hash. Just save the url and you have an instant wallet! If you want to throw off blockchain analysis, just make 2 easywallets, and send from 1 easywallet to another easywallet, you are done! The blockchain will show a fresh new wallet with no history.<br /><br />Easiest way to buy bitcoin is to make a mtgox account at mtgox.com, make sure you don&#039;t use tor when using mtgox or they will ban you. You can use a free public wifi like at starbucks though with no issues. Once you make the account, then go to bitinstant.com and choose send money by moneygram to mtgox.<br />It will give you a payment slip, write down the info or print it out. Go to your nearest moneygram like at walmart, 7-11, CVS, or wallgreens, and send the money to ZipZap. Tell them you want to pay a bill and they will look up the biller &quot;ZipZap&quot; manually for you.<br /><br />The money will show up in your mtgox account almost instantly. Then buy the bitcoins on the mtgox exchange at the current price and withdraw them to your wallet.<br /><br />

				Okay, well i think i&#039;m a little less confused now. i will try the online wallet instead. it does seem like a lot of steps still, but i suppose i should get used to it over time. when you say to go and pay with moneygram, is it right to assume that&#039;s in order to cover my tracks, rather than buying btc with credit card or similar things? that&#039;s part of the reason i have held off from actually getting anything for months now. i get paranoid when i&#039;m not sure what loopholes would leave me exposed. the other thing i was pondering doing was buying the bitcoin in the form of those disposable cards that you can buy online for a fixed price, but i think buying in that way is much more expensive than just having the btc transferred online. seemed like a simple way to get them though. i guess i shouldn&#039;t be so worried about it since btc isn&#039;t in itself illegal, but i think there&#039;s only a narrow spectrum of things you can buy with them, so it would be suspicious lol

				Buying BTC with money gram --&gt; Bitinstant (ZIPZAP) ---&gt; Mt. Gox is safe, just use a different name/address/phone on the transfer slip and mtgox account and don&#039;t leave fingerprints on the moneygram payment slip. When sending the money you could wear a hat and glasses for extra safety in case they play back the CCTV video. This is a cheap (4% cost) and fastest way to buy BTC.
