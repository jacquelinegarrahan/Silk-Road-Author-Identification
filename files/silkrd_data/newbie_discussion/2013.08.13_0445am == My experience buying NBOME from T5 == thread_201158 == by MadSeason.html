				&nbsp; Having never tried the stuff, I decided to buy 50 from T5 with the change left in my SR BTC wallet.&nbsp; On the profile page, it states over and over again how potent these tabs supposedly are.&nbsp; T5 states,&quot; If you have never tried NBOME, then DO NOT take more than a half a tab your first time.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I took that seriously even though I have tripped a thousand times on Cubes, DMT, Acid, and 2ci.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So first, it took 17 days for the stuff to reach my mailbox even though I live on the border of US and Canada (shipped from Canada) .&nbsp; That in itself is just asinine as in this day and age, it wouldn&#039;t take 17 days for NBOME to reach me from Mars.&nbsp; That wasn&#039;t really an issue though, just a minor annoyance.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Me and a few buddies decided to go camping to try these so we would be away from prying eyes in case the stuff made us go crazy or some shit.&nbsp; We did as the profile page said....we ate a half a tab.&nbsp; After an hour, all we had was a bad taste in our mouths.&nbsp; No bright colors, no trails, no nothing.&nbsp; We decide to drop 1.5 more in the hopes we could salvage the night.&nbsp; After another hour, we seen some trails and got the giggles a bit, but absolutely positively ZERO movement of any object whatsoever.<br /><br />&nbsp; At this point, I&#039;m the laughing stock of the evening and get the, &quot;I told you so&#039;s&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; It fucking sucked hard.<br /><br />&nbsp; From two tabs of this crap, we tripped about the same as 2g of shrooms....hardly what the profile states.<br /><br />&nbsp; But you know what?&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t even upset afterward.&nbsp; Shit, I spent $35 to find out that NBOME from T5 had about the same effect as drinking a pot of coffee, no biggie. <br /><br />&nbsp; So I PM T5 and explain that I had my doubts that his tabs were 1000au, but I still gave him a 5 feedback and told T5 I wasn&#039;t upset, and wouldn&#039;t change the feedback....I just thought they should know in case they had a bad batch so they could change orders if necessary.<br /><br />&nbsp; T5 PM&#039;s me back and apologizes and doesn&#039;t understand how it happened.&nbsp; We PM a few more times and T5 offers to reship and I accept of course because I want to see what NBOME has to offer.&nbsp; I offer to send T5 the remaining 42 tabs of junk in return, which T5 declines.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; It&#039;s 20 days since that conversation and no reship in sight.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really care about that aspect though.&nbsp; What pisses me off is that T5 gave his word and broke it.&nbsp; Not only that, but waiting on drugs in the mail is stressful as hell.<br /><br />&nbsp; So....Mr./Mrs T5....If&#039;n ya ain&#039;t gonna stand by YOUR WORD, then don&#039;t offer reships because those of us on the other end just end up getting stressed that LE got the mail and we end up waiting for the knock at the door.&nbsp; Also, in the future, put a damned return address on the envelopes full of drugs you send to people for crisake.&nbsp; Not having one on international mail is like putting a fucking neon sign on the package that says, &quot;IM DRUGS&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;m not calling T5 a scammer at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m just calling T5 a lier, which is worse than a scammer in my opinion.&nbsp; Why peeps bring the bad karma on themselves is beyond me.<br /><br />

				Interesting... I hope you get your reship at some point<br /><br />btw, I think you are supposed to place them between your front teeth and your upper lip AND try not to get much into your saliva. They aren&#039;t effective orally, only through whatever I just described<br /><br />But you probably already knew that

				As the other poster said, if you literally ate the tabs they would not be effective. If they&#039;re complexed you need to hold them under your tongue or between your cheek and gum for 30 minutes without swallowing any saliva.<br /><br />If they have an HCL base then you need to do the same thing but only for 5 minutes and you can swallow saliva normally.<br /><br />Also if it&#039;s 25i-NBOMe then i&#039;d say 0.5mg is a weak ass dose, personally 1mg is pretty good but not amazing and 1.5mg is my sweet spot where I can&#039;t stop laughing and get awesome visuals and very outlandish thoughts.

				&nbsp; Before ordering, I read everything I could about NBOME on Erowid.&nbsp; We were aware how to take them, and put them between our cheek and gum as instructed.&nbsp;

				I love psychedelics.&nbsp; <br /><br />Buy some 25c nbome poweder and mix it to 1mg per ml of vodka.&nbsp; <br /><br />half a ml to one is a great trip which is as nice as lsd imo.<br /><br />Only nicer thing about lsd is I can take 10 hits adn feel healthy during adn after.

				&nbsp; I waited a week for T5 to show up on this thread and explain himself but I guess it&#039;s hard to argue the point when you know you&#039;re in the wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I will continue to bump this to the front page daily just so peeps can make a better judgement when purchasing NBOME......go with anyone besides T5 is my advice.<br /><br />&nbsp; Waiting like a fucking retard for mail that never comes really pisses me the fuck off....not to mention the stress of wondering if the douchebag actually sent it and it got nabbed.<br /><br />&nbsp; Fuck you T5.....may you and yours live in interesting times.

				I started to reply to this post even before realizing I just ordered nBOME from the offending T5! Late last year, new on the road and full of excitement for a long waited chance to take LSD, I hastily ordered 25 hits on blotter from the first vendor on the psychedelics page. As it turned out the acid was strong and so cheap I ordered a few thousand because I just love spreading powerful psychedelics around... Anyways UK vendor Tyl3rDurd3n is solid from my experience however unfortunately is no longer online or changed accounts...?

				&nbsp; While checking the mail yesterday, I see the white envelope and almost shat myself....there was the reship from T5!<br /><br />&nbsp; I and a couple of buddies tested them out last night and I have to admit....they were amazing.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the first batch was a fluke of some sort.&nbsp; I just wanted to edit this thread to reflect that T5 did reship, and his NBOME seems very good to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I liked it so much, I&#039;m going to order 500 more from him.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; All in all, everything worked out in the end.
