				I&#039;m just looking for reassurance, nothing has happened.&nbsp; If an ounce of MDMA got seized, would that result in a love letter or a more personal visit (door knock, controlled delivery, etc).&nbsp; Please only respond if you have first hand knowledge, is you received a love letter for that quantity - or more - or got caught up with less.&nbsp; Thanks!

				Sorry, I don&#039;t have personal experience, but have some almost completely baseless speculation instead:<br /><br />For simplicity, let&#039;s say a dose of molly is 100mg. I know that&#039;s on the low side, but it makes the math easier and more likely to fuck you over, which seems to be law enforcement&#039;s MO. 1oz is about 28g or 28000mg. That&#039;s 280 doses. That&#039;s most definitely not a quantity for personal use, so if it were discovered, they&#039;d probably be pretty excited at the thought of busting someone for intent to distribute. Even if it&#039;s not a huge distributor quantity, they&#039;d probably want to question you in hopes of catching someone higher up in the chain. Which sucks for you, because thanks to SR, you have no fucking clue who the next guy up in the chain is.<br /><br />But again, this is speculation.

				You really only want to hear from people busted getting over an ounce of molly in the mail? Cue the crickets.<br /><br />The thing that will make the biggest chance of your getting a visit is where you live. Big crime infested city, not so much. Shitty redneck hick town, maybe. Do the cops look at you already?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so you are probably fucked, if not then stop being paranoid until you have a reason to be. <br /><br />If you are worried about an international shipment, an ounce is small time. Probably get seized and that is it. The odds of it getting seized are a total crapshoot. The only times I eve had things held up in customs were car parts that broke through the packaging. <br /><br />Things I have shipped have only ever been held up going to australia and canada. Both were large packages, the one to canada had fluids leaking out of it (differential) and the one to australia I treid to get cheap and call the contents loose car parts as the tax on a cylinder head was stupid.<br /><br />Smoke a joint or take a valium and wait for the mail to come.
