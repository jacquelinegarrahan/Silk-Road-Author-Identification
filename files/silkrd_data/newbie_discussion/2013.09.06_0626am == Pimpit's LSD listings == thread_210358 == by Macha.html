				Hi guys, have you guys checked our pimpit&#039;s listing on LSD? They are 250ug for a very cheap price. Usually, this would spell out scam to me but considering I have heard nothing but great reviews(based on DMT products), I was wondering if he could still be trying to scam or it legitimately is that lowly priced.. I was originally going to go to machinemaid but looking at pimpit&#039;s prices, I&#039;m stuck debating on what I want to do. Anyone care to give me some ideas?

				I had the same question. One of the two pieces of feedback on his acid comes from the same name as a forum account that I suspect is his, which concerns me. It seems a bit too good to be true, but I&#039;m definitely hoping it is!

				Search&nbsp; Pimpit in r/silkroad on reddit. between these forums and the endless amounts of vendor reviews on reddit, one of them usually has at least one review for everyone. some people are waiting for their order on there as well if you haven&#039;t already checked it out.&nbsp; ;)

				Guys is there any real acid left out there, you know like in the 80&#039;s, walls breathing, seeing music, detached from body?&nbsp; I have gotten a few tabs from friends in the last few years and honestly did not do much of anything,&nbsp; I am not sure I would even take it anymore, if I knew it was that strong (getting to old&nbsp; :-[ I guess), but maybe just one more time before I die.&nbsp; So does it exist, 1 hit and you are in another world, true trip?

				The LSD is legit I tested it last week and it was the best I ever had with just one.&nbsp; He gave one bonus for a total of 6 as well., same blotter art as pictured and everything. I&#039;m picking-up another 5&nbsp; then moving on to trying the DMT next.

				Sorry it took so late to reply, I&#039;ve been super busy.&nbsp; I won&#039;t have time to type up a full trip report right not, but I will soon.&nbsp; Package came and looked good, great stealth.&nbsp; I took one hit, and the come up was nice, smooth and gradual.&nbsp; After a couple hours, I smoked a bit of weed and it shot me out of this world.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking visuals everywhere and my mind was just fucked.&nbsp; Long story short, I died and came back to life.&nbsp; I saw everything come full circle.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think ego death off one hit was possible, but it happened.&nbsp; It is definitely as advertised, and messed with my mind more than any other source I have tried.&nbsp; Get it while its hot guys!

				Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that today&#039;s the end of Pimpit&#039;s 25% off sale according to their LSD listings.&nbsp; I can&#039;t vouch for quality yet, but I placed an order and it made it through customs just fine.&nbsp; The parcel was opened slightly but it was incredibly inconspicuous inside and out.. great stealth!&nbsp; I recently paid 70% more for the same dosage from a US vendor, so I&#039;m glad I took the plunge to save some bitcoins buying from a Canadian vendor.<br /><br />Will update this post if the quality isn&#039;t up to par, but based on other reviews I shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about.&nbsp; Buy it up while it&#039;s on sale!&nbsp; $95 for a 10 strip of 250 µg blotter is amazing!&nbsp; Sorry for the long post but I was on the fence for about a week before I made the plunge and great LSD deals don&#039;t come along every day. :)<br /><br />Link: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d0182b4473

				I have some on the way and will definitely report back here and on his vendor discussion. I really actually wanted to get a good quantity but I&#039;m too skeptical and this seemed too good to be true. I&#039;m extremely sad I am going to miss the promotional pricing on a proper amount but I always stress with a new vendor. Pimpit will be my my 10th vendor though, it feels like an achievement with the new stat system haha :)<br /><br />Hope we all love what&#039;s coming! :D
