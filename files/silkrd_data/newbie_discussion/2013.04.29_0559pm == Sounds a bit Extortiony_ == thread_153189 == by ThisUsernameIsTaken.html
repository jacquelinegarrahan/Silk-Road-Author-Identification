				Sadly, I can&#039;t link the item in question because of the DDOS attack going on, but it was for Cheba Chews under the edibles section. <br /><br />The seller plainly states that they will hold onto your mailing address until they receive their 5-star rating...this is after their introductory paragraph stating they have a perfect history mailing their items and never a problem (and 99% rating).&nbsp; <br /><br />How can a prospective buyer trust this vendor who is basically going to extort you for a perfect rating, when even the Silk Road FAQ for the sellers states that the information such as that should never be saved, and destroyed after shipping? What incentive is there for the seller to ship a good product and work with the customer on any issues ?<br /><br />I really would like to try that product - but not with that disclaimer. <br />

				Whoa, that blows. The solution is simple however - do not have dealings with vendors that hold you to ransom. <br /><br />You should be free to give the rating you feel the product and service you received deserves, no more no less.

				Report that to the Silk Road admins IMMEDIATELY or as soon as you have access to the site. That type of behavior is not allowed and is against the vendor guidelines. And also pretty fucked up if you ask me.
