				I have posted here because of this BS 50 post rule. and i cant be arsed to spam my way to 50. <br />I recently bought 25 hits off LucyDrop. i waited about 8 days since finalization for it to come and was excited as its been getting rave reviews.<br />I dropped 1 and a half blotter which is meant to be &quot;150ug&quot; <br />it takes 1 hour for the first effects to come in. and 4 hours for it to start coming up properly. this is strange acid. but it is definitely LSD.<br />now i didnt get a single visual or CEV from this acid. and barely felt the slightest buzz out of it. <br />I do not believe lucydrop done this on purpose. but i and many others i have seen in his thread have seen a massive potency difference in his tabs. <br />i sent lucydrop a message about this. and looking back on it. this feels what id imagine 50ug to feel like.<br />I had no tolerance left over from any other psychedelics and would encourage lucydrop to have some words with his guy who lays the blotter as i feel ripped off. it is great clean LSD but the way it has been laid is horrible. there are some users reporting some tabs are strong. and others saying it does barely nothing!<br />I hope lucydrop corrects this potency issue with his tabs because apart from that he is a star vendor!
