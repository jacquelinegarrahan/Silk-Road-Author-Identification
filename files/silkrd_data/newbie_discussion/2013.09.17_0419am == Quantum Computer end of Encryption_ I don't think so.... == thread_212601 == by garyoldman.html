				I read on another SR Forum yesterday this posed a threat to encryption.&nbsp; There are many arguments you can find from credible sources that dispute this assertion.&nbsp; A simple solution for those who use PGP encryption:&nbsp; encrypt a message, enclose the encrypted message within another layer of encryption and SO ON ... the effect is to create an exponentially strengthening encrypted message.&nbsp; The article, reposted below, from ComputerWorld also discusses the flaw(s) in thinking Quantum Computers could be end of encryption.&nbsp; I am VERY NEW to the encryption game so intellegent discourse on this subject would be most appreciated and valuable to those of us who love our freedom, and wish to have access to methods of living a private, censorship free existence.&nbsp; Thank you!<br /><br />https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/354997/The_Clock_Is_Ticking_for_Encryption?pageNumber=1

				Commercially usable Quantum computers are still a few years off. They will also bring in their own type of encryption<br />which is only possible with Quantum computers. I&#039;ve not read the most recent research but I think the field is called Quantum Cryptography.<br />The nature of quantum mechanics guarantees that measuring quantum data disturbs that data; this can be used to detect eavesdropping in quantum key distribution. So I don&#039;t think its the end of encryption either.

				depends on the strength of the encryption ive heard 1024 is childs play to de-hash where as ive read about extentions for gpg that allow any program to use 10000bit which is a rediculous amount which i will continue reading about because if true..........fuck yeah im gunna gpg the shit outa some stuff for the world never to read ahahahahaha
