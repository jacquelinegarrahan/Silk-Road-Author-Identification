				My favorite drug used to be MDMA..that was before I tried opiates.&nbsp; Then I went too deep down the road of opiates, so my favorite is back to mdma...Though I only try to indulge every six months.

				25 years of&nbsp; drug abuse. 10+ years wasted to heroin (I/V), 5+ years lost to coke and crack. Its not all doom and gloom, 25+ years taking MDMA and many psychedelics. Ive done hospital, rehabs, 12 steps, you name it I&#039;ve been doing it recovery wise.<br /><br />Im currently clean from opiates and cocaine, but started using drugs again 3 years ago after a 4 year break being abstinent (12 steps work).<br /><br />THE ONLY&nbsp; DRUG THAT HAS NEVER DONE ME ANY REAL HARM IS CANNABIS!!<br /><br />I smoke weed every day with only positive outcomes (well the lazyness and over eating are debatable I guess). For me it has to be and can only be cannabis in all its glorious forms!!

As far as your question, my first handful or so of dmt experiences were with a basic spoon pipe. I measured out my desired dosage and nestled in in between two layers of cannabis ash. Regardless of what instrument you use to administer DMT, you always want it to vaporize. That being said, the ash layers help shield the DMT crystals from burning in the event that a flame touches the contents of the bowl. My best experiences with the spoon pipe resulted from when I had someone there to help vaporize the DMT after the first two inhalations...very important to instruct them to let the heat of the flame be pulled through by your inhalation instead of torching the whole bowl.<br /><br />I now use &quot;The Machine.&quot; Its a homemade vaporizing device made from a small glass bottle and heavy-duty metal scouring pads. One of the best features about this vaporizer, other than being very efficient with DMT, is that it has enabled me to feel more comfortable smoking DMT by myself, not having to worry about setting an ash-filled pipe down. For me, the solo psychedelic journeys that I have had have been tenfold better than having someone else with me, but that&#039;s another story.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently looking into making another vaporizer such as &quot;The Key.&quot; Both can be found via a Google search or on DMT Nexus.<br /><br />First post here on the SR forums. I&#039;m new here, but not so new to SR. Not trying to spam my way to 50 post, but rather help people along the way.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />ZPR

				I said cannabis earlier as my favorite drug, and technically it still is, for many reasons, but as far as pure euphoria, MDMA. Unfortunately with something so good comes a huge tradeoff. I&#039;ve been told never to do MDMA more than 10-15 times in your entire life. I hit the 20+ mark over a decade ago, and that was the last time I&#039;ve done MDMA. Let&#039;s face it, the comedown sucks balls.

				Had some blue pills years ago - supposedly some kind of synthetic mescaline.&nbsp; It was called Smurf at the time (early 90&#039;s) and was pretty amazing - beautiful visuals, great mood and not too much of a hangover.. Taking a random pill was probably not the best idea in hindsight but it was a long time ago.

				Oh man...you ask a loaded question there, my friend. It would be too easy to say weed, as that&#039;s almost become like breathing to me, being in a state where it&#039;s legal. Hallucinogenics are my thing, but my favorite right now is 25i-NBOME. Not to say that good ol&#039; fashioned LSD isn&#039;t fucking incredible, as it is, however it&#039;s not NEARLY as readily available, nor is it even close to as cheap. 25i is simply incredible, and everyone I&#039;ve let try it has said the same. I&#039;ve tripped well over 30x 1000ug tabs in the last month (which probably isn&#039;t good for my sanity) xD<br /><br />I keep hearing MDMA is one of the absolute best as well, though I haven&#039;t tried it yet. Not sure why, I guess I should do that soon.&nbsp; :P Shrooms are a close second to 25i, though they aren&#039;t as visually oriented, which is my favorite part of tripping. :)

				Hi NaturalHigh&#039;s! - Good Thread&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />From age 17 until around 4 years ago, I indulged myself (on and off) in frequent bouts of serious substance abuse.<br /><br />Some impacted me more than others.<br /><br />- Cannabis - Smoked everyday since the age of 15 (and still do).<br />- Clubbing Scene Ecstasy / MDMA - x 3 Re-visited for up to a year or two at a time.<br />- Amphetamine abuse including &quot;Speedbombs&quot;, Base, Paste, etc<br />- Cocaine abuse including Crack<br />- LSD / Magic Mushrooms - Not too often over the years, but always good experiences.<br />- Valium &amp; various other pills.<br />- Heroin - Never did this thank goodness!<br />- Legal Highs - Mephedrone and many others (THIS SHIT NEARLY KILLED ME)<br /><br />Basically to add some background to the above drug taking, I was always able to abuse but kept things on track with the job and family responsibilities. There were two exceptions during the last 22yrs:<br /><br />1. Clubbing Scene (late 20’s) - on the 3rd time around, one time I hadn&#039;t slept for 2 - 3 day and went to work and more or less passed out. I was signed off work for two weeks to recover. To be fair I felt fine after a couple of days rest / sleep but still a shock to the system.<br /><br />2. Legal Highs (37-39) - This was something that completely crushed me (Methadrone). I had previously developed an addiction on speed/coke and this carried over to the legal highs. The buzz on this stuff was incredibly dirty and I went wild on the stuff.<br /><br />To cut a very painful story short, I didn&#039;t sleep for 4 or 5 nights, fell into psychosis and had the most public and embarrassing breakdown you could ever imagine. I found myself not trusting my own family / friends and had suicidal thoughts, as I felt manically depressed and could see no way to get myself back to who I once was.<br /><br />I thought I had given myself brain damage. My parents were going to get me sectioned and it was my brother and friends who stopped that from happening.<br /><br />After being signed off my work by my doctor, I nervously returned but continued battling the demons.<br /><br />Legal Highs had literately turned me into a zombie and I hated myself.<br /><br />Things HAD to change.<br /><br />Things did improve slightly over the course of that last year, I got a semblance of “normality and routine” but my confidence still lacked and I felt I was definitely a shadow of my former self. I felt I had lost brain power, my “mojo” and lust for life.<br /><br />It was at this point around April 2009, that I made my wish. I took the time to ask with all of my heart for something to happen to me, that might give me back what I knew I had lost to Legal Highs and the massive breakdown I endured (was still enduring).<br /><br />It was from that day that I started searching the internet for self-help / self-therapy / meditation / confidence tapes, etc<br /><br />I bounced around from one idea to another, trying this and that, with absolutely no success……although I would highly recommend Dale Carnegies “How to win friends and influence people” - a great read for anyone.<br /><br />I had noticed once or twice during my reading online, mentions of DMT and eventually one VERY fateful night - I got around to finding out what it was all about.<br /><br />After googling DMT, the first thing I ended up watching was Terrence McKenna’s You Tube - “Rap Dancing into the Third Millenium”.<br /><br />I remember vividly it was a weeknight and I started to listen to his speech around 11pm. To say I was gobsmacked by what this man was saying is a massive understatement; I could barely sleep and was thinking about it all the next day. When I got home and the kids got off to bed, I immediately started to read more and more about this unbelievable substance. At this point I had no thoughts on trying the stuff (I was COMPLETELY OFF DRUGS, apart from cannabis anyway); But I was just totally getting off on reading and watching as much as I could.<br /><br />I just couldn’t believe it was in us naturally; the birth, sleep and death releases…..Hyperspace, the Hive, dimensional travel, Entities!<br /><br />I mean what the F!!!<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE – I read and read and read and read from April 2009 until August 2009. Thanks DMT Nexus &amp; Erowid!<br /><br />I convinced myself that DMT was NOT a drug in the regular sense and that it might be useful for me to try it.<br /><br />DMT had found me and for a reason….<br /><br />So, that’s when I extracted my own Spice from MHRB and took my first launch in to the DMT Dimension :-)<br /><br />THIS was what I had wished for – THIS was the therapy I had needed.<br /><br />My setting was all about my own personal mindset of “Wishing to get back to my regular self” - Setting is an internal thing, not external (although being somewhere you are comfortable and with someone you trust does help).<br /><br />I went in with the wish for my brain / mind to be “reset” in someway and it certainly did that and more! A full system reboot on around 60-80mg of DMT via a Glass Bong was all I needed.<br /><br />At today’s date, I have my confidence back in spades and my mojo has never glowed so brightly, I see everything once more through the eyes of a child – Full of wonder once again.<br /><br />As for what is happening to me in the DMT World, well that’s a different set of stories, for a different day.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell........My Favorite by a long long way is NN-DMT&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br /><br />*************<br /><br />Main Listing: 250mg NN-DMT * High POTENCY - Trusted UK Seller *<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7f87868c0d&nbsp; 8) 8)&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />A few of our Stealth Listings (inc Pictures)&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2eee9b641b<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9fdf36e70e<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5ce84c5715<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ed192b3b04<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d30d7863ab

				This is going to sound such a cliché, but hey ho.....<br /><br />For me it&#039;s about the people I&#039;m with and what we&#039;re doing as much as it is the drug I&#039;m taking. I&#039;m into trance music and take MDMA when going clubbing or at a festival because the hit lasts longer than coke, I&#039;m not in my own little world unlike the kids taking K and I don&#039;t end the night throwing up like I do when I abuse alcohol.<br /><br />I really get off on having stupid conversations with strangers, hugging them even though I&#039;ve only known them for 5 minutes. I don&#039;t have that level of confidence normally but MDMA really knows how to bring out the best in me.<br /><br />Friends say I&#039;m funnier on coke than I am on MDMA but it&#039;s such a short lived thing that I don&#039;t personally enjoy it as much.<br /><br />When I was a teenager I took shrooms and LSD, and to be fair I had a fucking amazing time. I&#039;ve not done either in 20 years as I didn&#039;t have access to it and I was still married, but am seriously considering trying acid again... but if I do it then it&#039;ll be at home, alone, listening to some deep and dark trance music and staring at those Magic Eye posters from the 90s.<br /><br />I think I muse be the only person on here who doesn&#039;t really care for cannabis&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />So, anyway, my fave is MDMA by a massive margin, followed by coke - but that may soon change to LSD. And in 3rd place is definitely Jack Daniels&nbsp; :P

				Either 2C-I or LSD, not sure which. Depends on the mood.<br /><br />I have dabbled in everything though. Smoke weed every day and have for close to the last 10 years, love that.<br /><br />Out of dissociatives, I&#039;ve tried all but PCP and ketamine is my favorite.<br /><br />Of the stimulants, I like cocaine and dextroamphetamine, but I&#039;ve tried all kinds of meth, prefer oral administration. I also like chewing coca leaves, though it&#039;s dirty and nasty, you get all the alkaloids instead of just cocaine.<br /><br />Out of all the opiates, I still like opium the best and only in moderation. Everything else just makes my shits hurt, and I don&#039;t like painful shits.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a bunch of different Phikal and Thikal compounds: AMT, 5-MEO-AMT, All of the 2Cs, 5-MEO-DMT, 5-MEO-Dipt. I like mushrooms as well, but my favorites are LSD and 2C-I. They are sublime. MDMA I limit to less than once per year, and always in combination with other substances :)

				Meth - when it&#039;s good, and it&#039;s not always, some processes seem to tilt heavy to the levo. I sure wish meth did not have so many side effects. Dexedrine is near perfect.<br /><br />MDMA, and LSD.<br /><br />xanax is nice at times, as are the opiates, I am lucky that I never go too deep into the opiates.<br /><br />Good cannabis is always good.

				Hmmmm...Tough damn question.<br /><br /><br />I drink nearly every day now, but I can&#039;t say I still enjoy it anymore. <br /><br />Weed is too obvious an answer. While I love the absolute hell out of some weed, it&#039;s not something I can&#039;t live without...though I do smoke pretty frequently.<br /><br />I think this year (yeah, this year), my favorite drug is meth. In fact, I&#039;m finally getting the nerve to actually USE SR here in the next few days for the first time after drooling over the website for months. So, if anyone wants to throw out their favorite meth vendor, I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><br />Last year, and the year before, my favorite was benzos. Got into too much trouble with those and had to lay off of the. Still enjoy them from time to time.<br /><br />Who knows, my next favorite could be heroin. Never tried it before, but I&#039;m a big fan of oxys and such, just opiates in general. I&#039;m probably gonna find a stamp bag to test out in the next few days.<br /><br />But yeah, damn hard question you&#039;re asking everyone, OP. haha.<br /><br />

				The finest chemically-enhanced experience I have had was my first e. Not sure whether it was top-quality or just because I had no tolerance, but it was other-worldly. Have not been able to capture that feeling since. Acid is one of my faves too, although have not done it for a while. But for an every-day, user-friendly drug, you can&#039;t beat pot.

				I read a funny signature once (cant recall who&#039;s it was) that said &#039;whats your drug of choice? Depends, what have you got?&#039; but seriously, favorite drug, in the sense of that word is cocaine, but I find its a very private drug for me.&nbsp; I have had fun in the city, when I drank a little too, which makes coke a bit more euphoric and lasts longer than 20 minutes, but it makes a new chemical in your body called cocaethylene which is more more toxic to your liver, and probably brain too, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, nor do it again myself.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had way better experiences with other people on MDMA.&nbsp; Sharing experiences with others is the best way to go! Best experience ever was the PG pills from JesusofRave, I loved everyone around me, was hugging strangers and the like. Too bad JOR&#039;s gone now, does anyone know where I can get more PG pills from?&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested in trying LSD one day, but I&#039;ve never really been into marijuana, so I&#039;m not sure its the thing for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried 2cb which was fun, everything was beautiful, but the visuals had no real purpose, they seemed unnecessary, everything felt nice, but not the complete euphoria and no empathy like MDMA.

				Wow thats a hard one to answer .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I LOVE all drugs &quot; not the legal ones but, shit the legal drugs will kill you &quot; so only the illegal ones for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ok ill try with the last few real good ones <br /><br />I used to like POT and MUSHIES and LSD and SPEED and METH and Es and stuff like that but not no more .<br /><br />When i come on the road a few months ago i found MDMA and that was mint , you know all the LOVE you feel from it and stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ya see were im from you never see pure MDMA so that was just so much LOVE.<br /><br />Then i found Changa and man what a buzz that was. Never felt the LOVE like that before. So then i worked me way upto pure DMT and fuck me that shit is brilliant for leaving the body and having a good look around the universe and to see and confirm that LOVE IS THE KEY..<br /><br />And now i just found the best LOVE drug ever and that is&nbsp; 2CB and fuck me that is the best LOVEN shit ive ever had in my 60 years of taken drugs. Even better than the old days when the real LSD and SPEED were around i reckon.&nbsp; &nbsp; Man the feeling of TOTAL LOVE you get from 2CB is the best feeling ever.&nbsp; &nbsp; So yeah its got to be 2CB LOVE for me atm.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I LOVE DRUGS ,&nbsp; WHEN I DIE I WANT TO GO TO DRUGEAVEN .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />LOVE PEOPLE ,&nbsp; ITS ALL ABOUT THE LOVE&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;DONT LET THESE CUNTS LET YOU LIVE IN FEAR ANY MORE.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO LOVE AND ONLY LOVE.&nbsp;

				In order:<br /><br />1. Good MDMA, spacing it out by at least a month or two. Nothing beats the clarity and euphoria of M - I owe some recent successful life decisions to the clarity and insight that M gave me. <br /><br />2. Acid - just did it for the first time last weekend, and it was an experience that forever altered/enhanced my perception of reality. It&#039;s a powerful drug that deserves utmost respect. <br /><br />3. Weed - Yeah, barely a drug, especially here in BC. I rarely smoke nowadays, mostly to preserve my lungs, but love the occasional &quot;old fashioned&quot; high.<br /><br />4. Mushrooms - a very rare thing for me, as I usually get anxiety. It makes my list though because the rare good experiences have been great.

				Hard to say if there is just one favorite, more like what combination of good drugs is &#039;the best&#039;.&nbsp; For me; at least a gram of mother of pearl coke, complimented with some good herb and a couple bottles of ale.&nbsp; If I&#039;m trippin on good acid, I&#039;m doing an eight ball, smokin a quarter once, drinking half a case.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there is just one favorite for me.&nbsp; Although, the real good coke is very hard to beat.&nbsp; I do know of someone who has really good shit.
