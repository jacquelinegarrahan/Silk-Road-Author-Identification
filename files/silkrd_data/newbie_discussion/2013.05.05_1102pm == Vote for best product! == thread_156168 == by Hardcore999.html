				Missed placed for many others and I miss especially the shrooms...<br /><br />I voted hash for rich effects and flavors, little harmful to health, little costs. A good moroccan with a cup of coffee on a bright day...

				Coke is my favorite and that&#039;s b/c I can get stuff mid to upper 90%&#039;s . DubGx2 advertises 93% product and I tested it with EZ Test when I got it and it tested at 90-95% with no bad cuts. When I can get quality coke like that it is the only drug I want. There is nothing that comes close to high quality blow and it can be done fairly often whereas LSD (which I love) I can&#039;t do very often and quality is a crapshoot. The weed I can get from a dispensary for about the same price and it&#039;s hard to get going when trashed on good bud. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156168.msg1092959#msg1092959">Quote from: Hardcore999 on May 05, 2013, 11:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Post your vote and explain the reasons !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I prefer Bud/Weed/Hash.&nbsp; I just enjoy it more than any other substance I&#039;ve indulged in.&nbsp; I guess hallucinogens would be my second choice, preferably shrooms or CBoom.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luckily I&#039;ve finally found a great vendor on SR who has fast shipping and QUALITY buds.&nbsp; Where I&#039;m from it&#039;s very difficult to come across really good, dank bud.&nbsp; I prefer Sativa plants because I enjoy a head high where I can still function normally without that &quot;couch lock&quot;.&nbsp; I have to give a big shout out to Cannabis Crew who hooked me up with some nice Liberty Haze and Alien Kush.&nbsp; The Liberty Haze was awesome!&nbsp; Sweet, citrus, pine scent with a great head high.&nbsp; The Alien Kush was out of this world!&nbsp; I had a hard time finding the bud under all of those crystals lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like to give credit where credit is due so check them out if you&#039;re a smoker like myself.

				I voted MDMA but I miss my favorite, 2c-b. I have been a long time user of weed and hash, and only recently started with MDMA (2 years ago) and 2c-b (1 year ago), and I think the novelty plays a big part.<br /><br />But the most amazing time I had when I combined these 3 :-) The synergy between MDMA and 2c-b is perfect and the hash for the smooth comedown. Is can be a bit overwhelming though so better to try them separately first and find your ideal dose.<br />

				LSD, if you get a quality product.<br /><br />I enjoy how it makes me feel, almost always extremely happy. It makes life seem so simple, at the time. It really has helped me out with problems I have had in life and it has changed me for the better. I am a lot better person now that I&#039;ve done LSD.
