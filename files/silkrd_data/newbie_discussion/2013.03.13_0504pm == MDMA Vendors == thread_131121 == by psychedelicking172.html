				Oldamsterdam has had some really good stuff.&nbsp; If you are in the USA shipping can take several weeks.&nbsp; He lists it as 18 working days which can work out to over a month but in Europe it seems to take only a week or so.&nbsp; Your order is usually overweight.&nbsp; I had a 10 gram order that was about 10.5 and two rocks and people buying serious bulk are getting many grams extra.<br /><br />It seems lately his stuff has gone from white rocks to more brown and powder.&nbsp; But that means you are dealing with a purity level that is not that much lower.&nbsp; I am not a chemist but I have heard it is like 83% purity vs. the peak 84% that is possible.&nbsp; I have rolled well off brown stuff. The step to clean MDMA to white from brown can cost you allot of weight taking out the impurities.&nbsp; So someone making kilos could loose a good deal. <br /><br />I would perfer rocks because that is harder to cut, but OA has been legit in the past so I think it&#039;s just because powder is easy to ship.&nbsp; He is the only vendor I have had who sends rocks at all. <br /><br />My last order did not come but I got a full refund via escorw but it seems shipping to the USA is tough. There have been times when shipping was delayed because he said the quality was not up to his standards.&nbsp; Allot of vendors would probably not do that.
