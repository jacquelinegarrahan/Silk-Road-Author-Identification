				Hey guys, i&#039;m new to the site, so bear with me please. I&#039;ve read around, and have a basic understanding of how everything works. Nonetheless, i&#039;m still apprehensive in regards to security. <br /><br />I&#039;m using the TOR network (obviously) to connect to the site. I connect directly to the url from the TOR loading screen. This is sufficient as far as logging in goes right?<br /><br />What i&#039;m really concerned with is getting my coins onto the site anonymously. I&#039;ll be making a relatively small purchase (10BTC), and i&#039;m wondering if i can simply transfer the coins directly from my blockchain.info address to my address here. I purchased the coins through coinbase, and immediately transferred them to my blockchain.info account using google chrome. Do I need to create another wallet file &quot;anonymously&quot;before transferring my coins here? Or is so much additional security really unnecessary for a purchase like this?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have an alternate mailing address to send to, and the mailman won&#039;t deliver anything to my home that doesn&#039;t have my name on it. Is it okay to use my real name in the shipping address?<br /><br />I know these are newb questions, and i&#039;m probably being overly cautious, but I want to make absolutely certain i&#039;m doing this right before i begin. <br /><br />Thanks for helping :)

				Yes,&nbsp; always use your real name for shipping.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fake names are never a good idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just make sure you encrypt your address with gpg4usb<br />Also you can use instawallet for added security but Sr tumbles your coins and small purchases you should be fine.&nbsp; <br />The most important thing is read feedback from your vendor, make sure to go with someone that has been around a while and has a track record of packages making it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Actually it would be better if methods would not be discussed on this forum....<br /><br />Anyways, you can use blockchain (or was it some other site.. don&#039; remember right now. They have an anonymous sending option. My guess it that that is already enough. You can also use instawallet and spread out some btcs and use different identities and even better: Use different ip&#039;s on all of them. Oe send them to different blockchain anfd/or use iinstawallet and then&nbsp; send it to a blockchain wallet whoch you approach with a different&nbsp; ip and then send it anonymously to sr. Be creative and use your brains.<br /><br />
