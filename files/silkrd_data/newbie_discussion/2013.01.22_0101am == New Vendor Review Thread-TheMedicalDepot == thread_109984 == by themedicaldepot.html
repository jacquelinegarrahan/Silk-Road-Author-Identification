				Hey everybody. I wish I could post this on the rumor mill, but sucks to have a new forum account I guess.<br /><br />SR OG&#039;s: Read no further. Yes, I will send some samples in exchange for a review. Contact me through the forum privately and we can discuss it further. <br /><br />I&#039;m SR&#039;s newest weed and hash oil vendor. <br /><br />My seller account: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4a3e8adb7f<br /><br />Currently offering 100$ half ounces of indoor medical flowers and 40$ grams of wax as grand opening deals. With escrow. <br /><br />I intend to become a bulk seller of weed and hash oil primarily, but I will also add some other drugs to the mix over the next couple months as noted in my profile. <br /><br />Please post your reviews below. Or just say hello.

				Almost forgot to mention: <br /><br />I know a wizard in the kitchen. He makes awesome edibles, most of which currently go to real medical patients. And they love &#039;em. So if you just want delicious edibles for yourself or bulk thousand piece plus orders for resale, I can supply them. Send me a message on the main site and we&#039;ll talk turkey. The edible of the moment is delicious caramel. My source can also make weed-laced ingredients for your own cooking needs, like granulated sugar or butter.

				Hi, I might check this out soon when you get more reviews ~100 a half isn&#039;t too bad. What strain is it? If 100 is the introductory price then what will be the final price when you get a customer base? why is it 109 dollars now... did you put the price in BTC or USD, if it was in btc that will have to be changed.<br /><br />&gt;No pictures up because I haven&#039;t learned to scrub them yet but you guys all know what top notch bud looks like. <br />also removing EXIF data is easy, in fact most meta data is easy to scrub and can be done in gimp or photoshop, it also never hurts to see what you can extract with exif viewing tools before and after.
