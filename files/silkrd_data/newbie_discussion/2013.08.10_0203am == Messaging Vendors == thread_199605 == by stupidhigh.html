				How long has it been since you sent them? Do their profiles say they were &quot;last seen&quot; today?<br /><br />Most established vendors only care about encrypting when it comes to addresses or sensitive information. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				We respond quickly, but remember, this isn&#039;t amazon.&nbsp; Some people take their time.<br /><br />Also, if I saw that... I would reluctantly answer yes, and just ask you to buy it, depending on the item.&nbsp; Often times you need to just check the vendor page and read their terms and rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no problem selling to someone I feel fishy about if they FE.&nbsp;

				Give them 48 hours time, if they don&#039;t answer, just write them ah pm that you can choose where you buy from, there are so much vendors here so maybe he thinks about it, but vendors which have over 15 feedback on one day have a lot of work, give them time and otherwise choose ah other one!<br />if you have question&#039;s i am also ah vendor and could help you to write with the vendor only if you are a straight guy!!!<br />greetings

What&#039;s wrong with farmers!?!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />I accept orders from new users and old users alike. <br /><br />From a vendor&#039;s perspective a brand new user buying a lower priced item is actually low risk since they have little potential effect on feedback rankings. I am not sure all vendors realize this though. <br />A new buyer is potentially quite valuable to a vendor. If you can blow their mind with a great product and service then you may have earned a customer for life.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat the first purchase too hard. Pick a vendor with a good rep (you are on the forums so I don&#039;t doubt you have made some good choices), use escrow, encrypt your address, and just order it. Worst case you get cancelled and try someone else. The majority of deals here happen with no communication between the buyer and seller, other then an encrypted address.

				Like everyone else said, just be patient and you will get a response.<br /><br />A lot of vendors prefer you to use encryption on messages. If they have a public key in their profile, it is there for a reason; they want you to use it. I&#039;m sure many vendors simply delete non-encrypted messages.

				Vendors are going to be very reluctant to new buyers in the coming weeks. If I were all you newbies, I&#039;d make some transactions and fast. <br /><br />There&#039;s going to be a flood of people as many articles are being published on the clearnet about the silkroad.

				I always read a vendors profile completely before placing an order. Also, check their feedback comments. This will give you a good idea of what to expect when ordering from that vendor. Many of them will list their requirements for new buyers. You may be asked to finalize early as a new buyer. Most people will tell you not to FE but if it&#039;s a reputable vendor, you&#039;ll probably be okay. Just don&#039;t finalize any more money than you are willing to lose because you have no way to get it back. <br /><br />Your options will be a bit more limited for the first few transactions, but after you&#039;ve been around a few months and have 10 or more successful transactions, then more vendors will sell to you. However, you&#039;ll find the top vendors with the best products will often sell out within a few hours. You&#039;ll want to become a fan of those vendors and keep a close watch on their profile when you want to buy their product.

				In my experience I would check what the vendors policy regarding orders from low stat accounts.Make sure you agree with their terms and then place the order.<br /><br />I would not bother sending a message to vendors who have terms on their profile (they take the time to write the profiles to try and keep the FAQ&#039;s to a minimum)<br /><br />It would be worth checking through the last ten pages of feedback on the vendor page to check that they are active sellers and that they have had recent high success rates...<br /><br />Good luck!
