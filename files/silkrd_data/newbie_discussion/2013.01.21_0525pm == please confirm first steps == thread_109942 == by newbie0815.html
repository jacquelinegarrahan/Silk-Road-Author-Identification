				hey folks,<br /><br />totally new to this, but so fixed not having to leave the house and get aaa-stuff.<br />Have done about 20-30 hrs of research here (even had no clue of what BTC are last week:-)), I would appreciate you confirming and / or teaching me.<br /><br />1. should i do all this ordering / BTC-buying stuff from my house (so my IP?) or should i always use a friends house or internet cafe?<br /><br />2. do i need any additional programming / security programs besides Tor-Browser?<br /><br />3. i need to buy bitcoins, mkay. is localbitcoins the best/safest i can do? I want to avoid anything that is trackable. As in any questions, should i create my account there from another IP? <br /><br />4. OK probably i have bitcoins now (or did i forget any steps in between?) If yes, help is appreciated. It is a code when i understood it right. How can i send this code (these BTC value) to my SR account?<br /><br />5. i have it in my SR account now. I buy an item, i order. Then I give the vendor my adress. Is anybody here that says it is a stupid idea to use my own adress? (i am planning the first few orders&nbsp; to have weed sent only in very small amounts so it wont hurt that bad if&nbsp; i get busted, only Germany, only domestic......makes sense????)<br /><br />6. then i put my BTC into escrow, never FE, thatsÂ´s what i learned :-)&nbsp; &nbsp; Right?<br /><br />7. Open the mail, yummie...<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry for all these stupid questions, but probably you all have been in this stage....or i am just slower then the rest hehe.<br /><br />Thx for your help buddies<br />

				TBH, I don&#039;t understand a lot of what you&#039;re asking, but I&#039;ll do my best to answer.<br /><br />1) If you&#039;re practicing good security then you can order from your house.<br /><br />2) nope<br /><br />3) It depends on your country.&nbsp; <br /><br />4) That &#039;code&#039; is your btc address.&nbsp; You have an amount/quantity of btc AT that address.<br /><br />5) Place the item in your cart. select shipping option, enter ENCRYPTED address, enter pin, place order.<br /><br />6) Don&#039;t finalize until you receive the product.<br /><br />7) Something like that. ;)

				For a buyer? Probably good with a usb boot running tails or liberty. Encrypt your address with pgp when ordering. Be very aware of what incriminating information you are posting. Many people post things that will give them away in a heartbeat without thinking about the possible repercussions.

				1.) It&#039;s safe to buy Bitcoins from your PC with your personal information linked to your IP since buying BTCs is not illegal and all transactions within the bitcoin network are not (easily) traceable.<br /><br />2.) You should consider using Truecrypt or another software to encrypt your HDDs (if your really concerned about security (aka paranoia)). So if police kicks your door in and confiscates your PC they won&#039;t find any &#039;incriminating&#039; data. You should also install a PGP client (e.g. Kleopatra for Windows) so you can encrypt your shipping address with the PGP Key of the vendor.<br /><br />3.) Many sites offer SEPA wire transfers to buy bitcoins, it&#039;s not anonymous, but that&#039;s not so dangerous because of 1) <br /><br />4.) You need to copy the Bitcoin address from your SR profile and send BTCs from your client to this address (every transaction takes ~1h)<br /><br />5.) Use your own address (except you have a idea how to receive mail anonymously (abandoned house, anon PO box.. ???)) , but encrypt it with PGP!

I think Wordpress is the big headline. A lot of people (not Silk Road users) bought in when Wordpress announced they would accept Bitcoin. Wordpress is a big website, so that&#039;s a big deal.<br /><br />Do you even realize how much USD is being held in Bitcoin right now? Do you have any concept of what the larger Bitcoin market looks like versus the measly ~$2 million USD being circulated on this site every month? Bitcoin is much, much bigger than SR.<br /><br />Bitcoin =/= Drugs. Not even law enforcement actually believes that. I can&#039;t be pulled over and arrested for possession of Bitcoins. So let&#039;s not get ridiculous here. It is legal to buy Bitcoins and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to trace them and prove that they were used in a crime. A jury isn&#039;t going to convict me because I bought, sold or spent Bitcoins. They&#039;ll convict me when they find my bong and grinder full of weed on my desk and my blood tests positive for the relevant substances.<br /><br />PS: Here is a link to a chart of daily BTC output as of July 2012.<br /><br />http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/09/chart-520x251.jpg<br />Source: blockchain.info<br /><br />This chart shows as much as 14 million BTC being moved around the network in ONE day. There can only be 21 million BTC in existence. So more than half of all the Bitcoins that will ever exist was moved in a single day. At the time that was around $144 million being spent or otherwise transacted. Try to imagine comparing that to the total amount of BTC owned or held. And then compare that to SR.<br /><br />If I can find a newer chart I bet it&#039;ll show a lot more than this one.
