				After one to many bad experiences in the lovely world of dealing with drug dealers I&#039;ve decided to see what SR is all about. However I need some information as I am not very computer savvy. I get the basic idea behind bitcoins but I need some more info before I go into it. Like is &quot;bitinstant&quot; forreal or just a scam? Also if anyone could explain basically how the transactions work I&#039;d be very appreciative. I know some about PGP but I&#039;ll need to know more if it is really necessary. And is it better to get a PO box or get it delivered to your house? I mostly just buy weed and never really buy over the OZ so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have any problems. Anyways, I know people probably get sick of answering these questions but I&#039;d like to get some straightforward answers or at least linked to a forum that can answer my questions. <br />Thanks, klr37849

				Welcome! Glad you&#039;re asking. Have you tried doing a forum search to find some more answers?<br /><br />Bitinstant is forreal. I don&#039;t use them anymore however. They&#039;ve been having issues with coins among other things. I&#039;m currently using bitfloor and really liking it. There&#039;s also coinbase, btc-e, and many others. The more research you do here and google searches, you&#039;ll find them.<br />The transactions work like this: once you&#039;ve acquired bitcoin (btc) and placed them in your sr account, found a product you like, done research on the vendor to ensure they won&#039;t rip you off, you place the product in your cart, encrypt your address with PGP (YES, it IS necessary, it protects you from LE) and wait to get your order in the mail. Once you do, make sure it&#039;s what you ordered and then finalize your order which releases the money to the vendor. If it isn&#039;t correct, message them.<br /><br />Don&#039;t ever finalize before you receive your product!!! This is an excellent way to get scammed and there are plenty of vendors who will let you order regardless of being new.<br /><br />Check out the newbie pgp forum and the regular pgp forum to learn more about it. They&#039;re both stickied threads and should be easy to find.<br /><br />Do plenty of research and feel free to PM me or post here if you have any more questions.

				Welcome!<br /><br />Bitinstant IS real, however they have been having real spotty service lately. A better alternative would be Bitfloor (if you are in the US and near a Bank of America). Other than that, there are vendors on here that do exchanges. <br /><br />When you go to checkout, you will see all the items you have added to your cart. There will be a field for your address, encrypt, copy, paste. <br />The money will be deducted from your account and held in escrow until you finalize it by going to the orders screen and clicking &quot;Finalize&quot;.<br /><br />NEVER NEVER NEVER FINALIZE BEFORE YOU GET YOUR PRODUCT. If you do that, it is going to be VERY difficult to get your money back. Any vendor that has a blanket FE policy is probably a scammer. Some are not, but it is best to be safe. Only finalize early if you are willing to lose that money, personally I do not see why anyone would want to throw away money but hey, to each their own yeah?&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />ALWAYS do research on a vendor before ordering. This is where you can find detailed reviews of his product and get up to date on any drama going down with him. Not all vendors have a review thread or even a forum presence, this does NOT mean they are scammers, but it is comforting to see a nice huge review thread that you can sit back, light a bowl, chill out and read through. <br /><br />If you are doing personal amounts of weed, straight to your house should be fine assuming you choose a solid vendor (which is what we have the forums for!) The issue with a PO box is that you lose a lot of your plausible deniability. Anyone can get your address and name and send drugs to your home, but usually you are the only one who knows about your PO box. It is up to LEA to prove YOU are guilty, NOT up to you to prove your innocence. NEVER say anything to the cops. If you have an encounter and you are worried you might talk, tape your mouth shut. It could save your life. <br /><br />If you want practice with PGP, check out the newbie PGP club stickied at the top of this subforum. It&#039;s fairly simple once you get the hang of it, nothing really technical involved, just a lot of copy/paste and button clicking. <br /><br />If you have any specific questions about anything feel free to pop me a PM!

There have been people who have gone to jail for receiving things at the post office. Criminal law is very much about intent, and going to pick up mail is very much a active action, you have to know something is waiting for you to go get it. Where as anyone can send you a package to your house, it doesnt mean that you requested it. You are required to have identification and a physical address on file to rent a PO box, so its not like it is any benefit at all if the police come knocking. <br /><br />And just want to reiterate, NEVER say ANYTHING to the cops. Thats what a lawyer is for. Nothing you tell the police can help you if you do go to trial, it can only hurt you.<br />
