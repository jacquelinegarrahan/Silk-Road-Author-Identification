				Ok so I just found out about the road. Fuckin awesome first of all.<br /><br /><br />Now. <br /><br />I seem to be having trouble understanding the best way to get bitcoins. Just when I start to think ok I know how, I get it.......I see someone like NO THAT METHOD IS TERRIBLE!<br /><br />So is there anyone who can point me to a step by step guide on how to get BTC and then get it on to SR safely? <br /><br />So basically it goes like this....<br /><br /><br />1. Get BTC<br />2. Transfer BTC to SR<br />3. Place order, and encrypt address with what&#039;s called &quot;PGP&quot;???<br /><br /><br />I just need some type of A-Z method of buying some drugs off SR lol. Am I a complete idiot for not being able to find such a thing? <br /><br />Also, is 1 BTC = 65.54??? <br /><br />

				Here&#039;s my method: <br /><br />Bitinstant.com---&gt;Cash deposit (I choose CVS)--&gt;pay to--&gt;Bitcoin address. You get slammed with fees this way, though. But it&#039;s a good method for getting a couple hundred bucks onto your account. Also, it&#039;s your choice if you want to send to you SR address or a third party bitcoin wallet address.

				Ok so is it a bad idea to do a cash deposit at bitinstant and then transfer the BTC straight to my silkroad adress?<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read so far, that WILL work but is somewhat unsafe?<br /><br />And also, is it the best idea to be looking up &quot;step by step process of buying drugs on silk road&quot; on the &#039;clear net&#039;?<br /><br />I&#039;m no total computer newb, but new to TOR and SR and BTC and PGP obviously. It&#039;s a lot to learn at first.<br /><br />I know it will be easy once I get it all down though.<br /><br />Thank you all SO much for fast replies, I didn&#039;t expect it to be so fast.<br /><br />Also, what&#039;s the best way of finding the cheapest products? <br /><br />We&#039;re on here buying drugs, so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be judged for saying I want to buy top quality product at the best price and then resell. I&#039;m not new to selling so I&#039;m cool there, it&#039;s just all this process that&#039;s confusing me.<br /><br />Please forgive my newbiness, I&#039;m not trying to make people do all the work for me. If you have a link to a page that tells me exactly what to do I&#039;m not too lazy to read it. Sometimes it&#039;s just nice to talk to real people about it though.

				i do what kandykidd does, i use bitflorr but i used to use blockchain and make a cash deposit at the customer service center at walmart just set up the deposit via blockchain get an email with an account # then go to wal mart and transfer cash to that account number by filling out a moneygram transfer slip and your money is usually in your wallet by the time you leave the store. <br /><br />i would always send it to a separate wallet than directly to SR address btw

				Ok so basically it could go something like this.<br /><br />I make an account with Mt Gox (even though they&#039;re making you give a bunch of personal info now?) and use bit instant to do a cash deposit at the bank that will land in my Mt Gox account as BTC.<br /><br />I get an email with some kind of reclaim code? This is where it gets fuzzy to me, probably because I haven&#039;t done it. After I reclaim my bitcoins in my mt gox account (i assume) I then send it to an instawallet account. I then send it to another instawallet account. Then i send it to another. Then when I&#039;m satisfied with that, I can send it to my silkroad adress? <br /><br />Then just buy whatever I want?<br /><br />I&#039;m still a little confused, but I think I could go out and do it if I had the money. Where can I see what the bitcoin exchange rate is compared to USD?

				I think I might be wrong, but I think it works like this.<br /><br />You create an account with Mt. Gox and get an account number. (do this somewhere other than at home, but NOT on Tor if you&#039;re super paranoid)<br /><br />Use bitinstant to set up a cash deposit at a bank, which will send the BTC into your Mt. Gox account. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen the bitinstant site, so you know that you put in the MtGox acct # and give them a notification email. (use a tormail account for this) <br /><br />Ok so you do everything on clearnet on bitinstant, and you go and pay at the bank.<br /><br />Then I supposed you would check the email (not at home), and claim your BTC in the Mt Gox account. Once your funds are there, you create an instawallet, and send the funds from MtGox to your instawallet. Whenever using Mt Gox don&#039;t be on tor. After you get it in to the first instawallet you can send it from there to an instawallet you made on Tor. <br /><br />Then get on tor, go to your tor instawallet and send them to as many other instawallet acct&#039;s as you want, and then to silkroad, and your good.<br /><br />Is this right? someone help us lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think? I might be wrong, I&#039;m still kind of confused. <br /><br />I feel like you&#039;d probably be ok if you did most of this stuff at home, but if shit came to shit you&#039;d be screwed/a lot easier to find. If you&#039;re not getting major weight it should be fine but do you want to take the risk? It&#039;s a pain to go and do this stuff somewhere public or whatever but I guess it&#039;s worth doing.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll probably go to the community college computer lab to set all my accounts up. You can pretty much just walk in there if you look like you belong on campus lol. I want some feedback on this plan though.<br /><br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />Wait, could you just use BitInstant to send directly to an instawallet account that you accessed with Tor only? Then just send straight from that instawallet to silkroad while on Tor to stay anonymous? I just realized that&#039;s an option. That way you cut out MtGox completely<br />
