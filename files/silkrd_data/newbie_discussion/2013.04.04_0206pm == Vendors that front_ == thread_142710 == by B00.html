				Hey there, let me start off by saying this is my dummy forum account.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on SR for over 10 months now.&nbsp; I have 0% refund rate and have spent well over $5k.<br /><br />I&#039;m a guy that has dealt locally for 10 years.&nbsp; Most of that was dealing lbs of Mexican brick until last year when I found the SR and all the lovely buds offered here.&nbsp; Since then I&#039;ve been ordering say an oz, sell half and keep the other half to smoke until I can place my next order.&nbsp; At one point I had finally built up but got ripped off after trying a new Vendor and so now I&#039;m back to my single oz trying to double up.<br /><br />My question: Are there any Vendors that actually front product?&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming you would have to place some kind of deposit, maybe half of the price?&nbsp; Would it be rude to ask my usual vendor for this option?<br /><br />I have 2 people that sell for me, so moving product isn&#039;t an issue.&nbsp; I&#039;d happily start off with just 2oz if someone was willing but paying $285 for an oz and trying to flip it just isn&#039;t working for me anymore.<br /><br /><br />Ill go ahead and throw in that I actually have a day job. $400 a week just ain&#039;t getting shit done though.

				I doubt it. You may be honest, but from their POV you&#039;d look exactly like someone trying to scam them. I certainly wouldn&#039;t if I was a vendor...

				Then maybe do a few deals with a couple a vendors, build up a rapport, then make the suggestion when you&#039;ve shown you&#039;re trustworthy (or reliable at least...). If it were me I wouldn&#039;t be asking for a cash/BTC deposit though, it&#039;d be personal info so if you screwed me I could screw you right back... guess you&#039;re lucky I&#039;m not a vendor&nbsp; ;)

				I doubt anybody would go for it. They have no incentive. Why would they front you something when they could just sell it to somebody else? The vendors aren&#039;t here to make friends, they&#039;re here to make money, and fronting anything to you isn&#039;t going to do anything but increase the chance that they lose money. On the street it&#039;s different because you are trying to network and move product, but I don&#039;t think vendors around here have an issue moving product. Maybe I&#039;m wrong though, but I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath
