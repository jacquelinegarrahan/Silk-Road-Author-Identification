				So I have got this white powder which is believed to be 2C-B<br /><br />my tiny scale shows its got 20mg, but I dont know whether this dose is too much for me. It will be my first time. I would like to know the decent first time dosage when snorting and when bumping it.<br /><br />Please note: I am not experienced with 2C-B<br /><br />have a nice week-end)))

				I did 25mg first time and it was mental but good, the most painful thing for the nose though, literally burns for 15mg, makes some people sick.<br />Literally laughing for 5 hours, great fun though, intense visuals not much headfuck, so all in all quite a &#039;fun&#039; psychedelic, take some k on it and it is mind blowing :-)<br /><br />Have fun!

				Ok, I see, my 20mg should be fine to bump although I have heard people saying to take less for the first time.<br />But really, this dosage of 20mg is often provide by most of the sellers<br /><br />And in combination with K (I guess its Ketamine) is indeed something new for me. need to find out how to take them together<br /><br />is btw S-Ketamine also fine to deal with?

				Me n my friends just recently got into the bees.&nbsp; I will say.. and this is very important.. DOSAGES VARY GREATLY from person to person.&nbsp; Even the first time.&nbsp; Me and 2 friends tried some a few months back.&nbsp; We decided to try 15mg as a &quot;low dose&quot; to get our bearings.&nbsp; It was like the 3 bears lol.. one friend it overwhelmed and he felt like it was too much (next time he took 10 and it was better for him).&nbsp; He was tripping hard.&nbsp; Other friend said it was perfect. And for me, I barely tripped and felt the side effects more than anything.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since decided my threshold is anywhere from 30-45 mg.&nbsp; So... try low dose first experience.&nbsp; after an hour or two, you can dose again a little if you want.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t suggest snorting it tho.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it once and it made my throat hurt for like an hour lol.

				I would say 25mg is probably a good starting dose. Yeah its true avoid administering this through the nasal membrane because it burns like hell. A good 20-30 minutes of pure pain. 2CB is a wonderful drug it just make everything look beautiful and you will see colors that you have never seen before. I really love it. Its a shame tolerance builds so fast and that you have to give it a least a week before taking it again because otherwise I think it would be great to take daily to enhance every sense. Also the effects it plays on your audio is quite unique as well. I have some 2CE looking forward to trying that at some point sounds similar but sliglhy more intense and less predictable. Anyway have fun.<br /><br />Peace.

				oh man. no advice for you. my one of a couple 2-cb experiences were all magical. probably one of my fav drugs. i think 2c-i is up there as well. i really dont think you could have a bad experience on either of those.<br /><br />and yeah, burns like hell, but fuck it, it&#039;s worth a little burn :)

				2C-B, like that whole family, is somewhat similar to LSD visually but without the expanded headspace. I did 20mg my first time and found it rather intense, but manageable. Body load was high, felt like shit the next day.<br />I don&#039;t much care for insufflation but even if I did, a full oral dose of 20mg sounds like way too much. My recommendation is to halve that... better yet, eat it instead. It&#039;ll last longer and the come-up was already fast when eaten. Insufflating the shit will make it much more rapid and intense.<br />Fuck that... but you go ahead. ;D<br /><br />Remeber: Erowid.org is your friend. Look it up. Read about it. Learn the science. Listen to the experiences of others. Know your drug. Be smart. Play safe.

				20mg is great for a first time and I recommend you take first 2cb alone and check for combinations later.&nbsp; 2cb is really wonderful!

				If you&#039;re gonna do 20mg u should consume it orally.<br /><br />By nose (insufflation) is half the dose for starters.

				Last weekend me and my friends each took a 16mg 2-CB pill from JanDeBouff, but we hardly noticed anything.<br />Afair 16mg should be a good dose, but there were no effects, no change in mood, no visuals (or what I might have attributed to it might as well have been bedazzlement from the bright flashing lights), my friends said the same, although they reported things feeling a bit artificial and they were a bit more confused, but that might as well have been the darkness/location and the constant &#039;search for effects&#039;.<br /><br />We didn&#039;t redose though, maybe I should try it again with more next time?
