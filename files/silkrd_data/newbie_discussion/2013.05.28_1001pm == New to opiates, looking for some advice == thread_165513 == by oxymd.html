				Besides a few percocet prescriptions here and there, I am completely opiate naive.&nbsp; IV&#039;ing an opiate is something I have decided I want to try (so please spare the &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot; posts).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure which opiate to start out with.&nbsp; I would like to get a reasonable bang for my buck and a real introduction to opiates.&nbsp; As far as I could tell from the times I&#039;ve had opiate pain medication they are not really my favorite thing and I got quite nauseated (I prefer stimulants), but none the less I would like to try. <br /><br />I am comfortable with an IV route of administration, and have access to all the sterile gear.&nbsp; I have given many injections and placed many IVs in my day, so this is really not an issue.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if I should start out with morphine, dilaudid, fentanyl, or heroin.&nbsp; Also I have no idea what a reasonable starting dose would be.&nbsp; I know what is recommended for pain relief, but no clue what a recreational dose for a first timer for any opiate should be (I am 140 lbs/63 kg).&nbsp; Any recommendations or personal experiences are appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks :)

				To be totally honest with you dude, whether you want to hear it or not, the fact of the matter is, that if you have little to no actual opiate experience, starting to bang right from the jump, is almost sure to prove a naive mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;Your probability of hard core addiction is imo, is much more likely... That being said, i know nothing of banging anything.

				Well you can certainly get Dilaudid or Oxycodone pills and dissolve and inject. Just make sure you filter properly when injecting any pill, as the last thing you want are binders in your bloodstream. Just look for micron or wheel filters on SR. Start with a low dose and go up as you need to. Never start with a huge dose just to get really high. That = OD.<br /><br />If you want a &quot;true&quot; IV experience, get a stamp of #4 heroin. One stamp should get you high as balls since you&#039;re basically opiate naive. With #4, you only need to dissolve in water.<br /><br />In my opinion, you should go with H if you truly are wanting to try IV. I used to divert Dilaudid in the ER and inject it (the actual hospital grade IV solution). I probably wouldn&#039;t have an arm if I were doing that with pills. IV&#039;ing drugs are dangerous, even if you know what you&#039;re doing, but pills make it exponentially more dangerous due to them not being made for that purpose.<br /><br />Edit: You say you&#039;ve started IVs and have access to sterile gear. Sounds like you&#039;re in the health care field as well. If you do, just make sure to never make that mistake of diverting from work. I got started down that path and I lucked out and avoided the worst consequences. If I&#039;d known about SR to begin with, I never would&#039;ve taken anything from work. Be safe.

				Sorry, no that&#039;s not what I was suggesting. I didn&#039;t make that clear, my bad. I was suggesting one stamp period, since that&#039;s really as small as you can buy. I was combining that with what I said before about starting with a low dose and going up. My bad!

				Don&#039;t do opiates.. YOU WILL BECOME ADDICTED&nbsp; :(. And then your life will spiral downward. Speaking from a whole lot of experience. Have fun with something else that won&#039;t put your body in a vise grip if it becomes un available.

				Well looks like your getting the much needed advice to stay the fuck away from the IV of the opiate. Whether you heed this advice is up to you. Personally I don&#039;t think you will. So with that said, why would you want to try this so bad? Seriously, I am more than curious to why someone who states they really did not care for the effects of pain meds and that they made you nauseous. Why then would you want to pursue a main line to your blood stream and the quickest onset to the brain you can get? Do you think this is going to make it better? Do you think your missing some euphoric orgasmic experience that you will just walk away from. Come on! Use your head for a minute. ;)

				I have also been taking opiates irregularly for a couple of years, sometimes pills sometimes H it just depends what is around. <br /><br />Starting to get a little bit more frequent now though, it&#039;s a very slippery slope it is one very seductive bitch heroin. I think everytime you take it maybe it gets a little bit harder not to want to do it again. <br /><br />It&#039;s your life though mate, do with it as you wish.

				You get addicted to opiates and don&#039;t even know you&#039;re addicted, because it totally washes away all normal logic. You&#039;ll rationalize with yourself that decisions you&#039;d normally consider wrong are right, because the end result is you getting your fix. Withdrawals won&#039;t kill you, but you&#039;ll feel like you want to die and it&#039;ll cross your mind a few times. Opiate addicts, like myself, can tell you all day long how bad it is and how you should avoid it at all costs. Right after that, we go get our fix because our legs start cramping. It&#039;s a pretty vicious circle. Shrug. At least there&#039;s SR for us degenerates. :P

				When a bunch of people who know a lot about drugs are telling you (on a drug-forum) not to do said drug, at least reconsider and flip a coin.<br /><br />That being said, how have you done the percs before? Cause before banging a stamp try; blowing some dope and ease your way into your eventual addiction. Ive sniffed once and it was awesome but IK what it was and once was enough no matter how good it felt. <br />So use some different script opiates and experiment before you head strait for that dope.

Opiate naive people can get wasted on 0.5 mg of the IV solution. I&#039;m not sure how much the PO = IV when it comes to dissolving the Dilaudid tablets. I&#039;ll let someone with experience in IV&#039;ing the tabs answer dosage. From my personal experience of taking and giving Dilaudid IV, 1 mg is a good starting point. I was up to 4 mg IV (a few times I tested my limit and did 6, but my stomach turned too much). Dilaudid is the closest thing to H I&#039;ve felt, H just lasts longer. In my opinion, getting some 2 mg Dilaudid tabs and IV&#039;ing half of one is probably going to be a safe dose for you. To be really safe, you can dissolve half of a 2 mg, pull it up in 2 mL and IV 1 mL. If that doesn&#039;t get you, IV the other mL. You know the routine in health care. You can always titrate up.<br /><br />A .45 micron filter will usually get the solution clear for you and if you don&#039;t IV pills constantly, should be ok for occasional recreational use. I&#039;d definitely get the .22 micron filters though if you want to be the safest. Do you have access to IV tubing filters? There&#039;s a filter you put certain IV drips on that you can just attach a syringe to and pull through and I believe it was even smaller than .22. It&#039;s been a while since I used it, but if you&#039;re in a health care sitting you should be able to get one with relative ease.

				hi oxymd<br />i would start sniffing first just to build a little tolerance. pushing off with no tolerance can be dangerous and also make you pretty sick.<br />although people do inject oxys, i wouldnt waste the time. they are pretty much all binder and junk. the high is good but not nearly the cream of the crop. oxycodone would be the bottom for rec usage.<br />iv. hydromorph and morphine are step in the right direction. here you start to get the blanket of love and all that warm bliss<br />imo the best of the best is and always will be junk. its the best bang for your buck as well. oxycodone sells on SR for over $1/mg with some vendors&nbsp; :o you can get very decent h for $0.20/mg and h is several times stronger then oxycodone. but i would start with some small bumps to build tolerance first, like match heads. if you want to get the real rush of h then you do need to bang it. it has to hit you all at once. <br />dont fuck with fentnyl without a tolerance you can too easily overdose.<br /><br />honestly h feels amazing but your playing with fire. it usually never ends good.<br />best of luck<br /><br />and i just want to add about dosing. please always start low esp. when banging. you can add a little more but you cant take it back. if you have no tolerance with h, 10-15mgs might get you high depending on weight and such. thats a very small amount of powder. i read above someone saying to do a full stamp. i think thats crazy. 100mg could easily kill you. try to get a jewel scale that weighs .001 and start with a small amount. have someone with you. you dont want to nod off and choke on your puke<br />if you do to much you can just close your eyes and thats it. h is very strong, most people build there way up to the stronger opiates

				your right, its not a good idea to take an unknown quanity. when dealing with strong opiates, minor increases can be alot and its difficult to eye out milligrams but dillies come in pill form so you will know how much your doing. h is always cut so you do have some wiggle room<br /><br />.1mg is no good for you. thats 100mg and remember there always a margin of error usually +/- 0.1<br />so your scale could say 100mg but really its like 175mg or it could 50mg. that scale isnt used for weighing anything under grams accurately <br />theres probably no stronger opiates you could handle 100mg of. it would be unsafe, make you very sick and if its good quality could kill you<br />if your doing h, start with like a match head size bump, a pea would too big. just to taste it. sure it will probably not fuck you up at all but atleast you will have a guide now to go off of.<br /><br />and legs means the length it lasts. i got some wicked black tar heroin that had some crazy legs

				You&#039;re in an enviable position right now. Most people dive in - or blindly stumble into - opiates without laying much groundwork or doing much preparation. You have a great opportunity to do everything you can to reduce the speed which with you&#039;ll become dependent (and odds are good that&#039;s a when, not if), and to enjoy as many beautifully euphoric highs as you can before the drugs stop working and you find you need them just to feel normal. <br /><br />You can research this yourself, but both OTC lithium orotate (not the lithium carbonate used to treat bipolar) and magnesium guard against drug dependency and slow down the rate of tolerance. Magnesium also increases the euphoria and analgesic effects of most opiates, so if you&#039;ve been taking magnesium supplements regularly, and then dose again before your first hit, you&#039;ll need less of the drug to feel an effect. And keeping your tolerance low is obviously a good thing. If you can visit a supplement shop and pick up both this early on in your opiate career you&#039;ll be much better off. <br /><br />Look for other potentiators, too. Phenylalanine is good. Basically do whatever you can now to reduce the amount of drug you&#039;ll need to get you high.

If you&#039;ve done four lines of something that takes 15 minutes to kick in thinking that the stuff isn&#039;t strong enough, by the time you feel the first rush it&#039;s too late to go back.

Most people dive in - or blindly stumble into - opiates without laying much groundwork or doing much preparation. You have a great opportunity to do everything you can to reduce the speed which with you&#039;ll become dependent (and odds are good that&#039;s a when, not if), and to enjoy as many beautifully euphoric highs as you can before the drugs stop working and you find you need them just to feel normal. <br /><br />You can research this yourself, but both OTC lithium orotate (not the lithium carbonate used to treat bipolar) and magnesium guard against drug dependency and slow down the rate of tolerance. Magnesium also increases the euphoria and analgesic effects of most opiates, so if you&#039;ve been taking magnesium supplements regularly, and then dose again before your first hit, you&#039;ll need less of the drug to feel an effect. And keeping your tolerance low is obviously a good thing. If you can visit a supplement shop and pick up both this early on in your opiate career you&#039;ll be much better off. <br /><br />Look for other potentiators, too. Phenylalanine is good.

				My experience with -attempting- to IV some coke was terrible - I couldn&#039;t get it in the vein and kept skin popping/having my veins leak blood into big baubles over my skin. Yuck.<br /><br />If you can place IV&#039;s well, you&#039;re at a good starting point then, though.<br /><br />My advice (I did extensive research also), is to (a) ensure you use the appropriate wheel filters to make sure you don&#039;t give yourself a blood infection or something equally nasty! I can post a guide on how to use the different filters for different meds/street gear if anyone&#039;s interested? If you PM me I might be able to sort you out some wheel filters (depending on your location) - I&#039;ve got a bunch left from my times (unused of course) - we have a very good harm reduction program where I live.<br /><br />(b)It sounds like you might have access to medical equipment/medications from your initial post. If you can get your hands on some naloxone, get some, and have someone &#039;babysit&#039; you while you dose. Make sure they know how to administer the narcan first!<br /><br />(c) Start small - you can always do more next time. Once it&#039;s in your veins, there&#039;s no turning back. Also - if you do it again with a different batch, please start small again - purity could be different. Seems obvious I know, but many people have died from eyeballing their usual &#039;dose&#039; when there&#039;s no way of properly measuring it.<br /><br />Good luck, have fun and be careful - I&#039;m glad to have tried slamming once or twice, but I left it at that. I&#039;m not saying you should do the same - that&#039;s just what worked for me.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Mr P

				I&#039;d get the 400mg tablets and then take two every four to six hours; if you start experiencing loose bowels at that point, ease off; if not, or if you don&#039;t notice anything, up your dose (I&#039;ve taken three to four times that and not run into problems). It&#039;s not a particularly dangerous mineral, and as long as you&#039;re careful in your experimenting you should be fine. <br /><br />If you search online for &quot;magnesium&quot; and &quot;opiate withdrawals&quot; you should find some good information. And if restless legs (so horrible) are a problem for you, try calcium supplements, too. Both should help. RLS is the worst.

				What opiate is gonna give just the best high in terms of feeling warm, happy, calm, blissful?<br />I would assume IVing H is the ULTIMATE, but i don&#039;t wanna get involved with that.<br />I&#039;ve done oxy 30&#039;s, both ingested and insufflated. but it almost feels like a stimulant, and sometimes makes me nauseous (which is all opiates though). <br /><br />like if i got dilaudid (hydromorphone), opana (oxymorphone), raw opium, morphine, etc. which one do you think would just be the best high for the above mentioned desired effects?&nbsp; I want to be able to just chill, feeling happy and awesome after taking something.<br /><br />some of these have low bio availability, so insufflating is still an option. not willing to IV :(

				I have to re-iterate what a really quite bad idea this whole thing is, not even just the conscious decision to start using opiates, which although we have all done, I&#039;m sure many of us really wish we hadn&#039;t and we had listened to someone that told us not to do it at the time instead of the usual &quot;It won&#039;t happen to me&quot; thing! <br /><br />If you&#039;ve never done H then just don&#039;t even consider IV&#039;ing it, regardless of the dosage you can&#039;t be entirely sure of the purity even from SR and it&#039;s just really not something that most people start doing. It&#039;s usually what people end up doing to save money and not waste H smoking it because they&#039;re addicted and need every crumb they can get not to sick. If you buy some of the higher grade heroin and you have no tolerance pretty much, just smoke it over foil with the top of a bottle cut off so you don&#039;t lose too much and you&#039;ll be absolutely fucking battered within minutes. Probably rushing, puking and wondering what the fuck just happened! You don&#039;t need to IV to get high from H or get a rush! <br /><br />Plus, and I am not in any way trying to patronise you or tell you what to do, the decisions you make will only affect yourself and not me that&#039;s all I&#039;m saying. I have been to enough NA meetings and met some of the smartest people, guys who have been clean 10 years and now own their own business&#039; and drive expensive cars, to realise that if you start fucking with opiates they will get you and they will own you and they will fuck you and take most of if not everything you&#039;ve got. Doesn&#039;t matter how smart or careful you are it just seduces you and before you realise it you&#039;re an addict, occasional opiate users are pretty few and far between and we all start off like that. Then the rest of your life you&#039;re either on H all the time or in jail or in rehab or just living your life clean thinking about it all the fucking time wishing you had never bothered with that shit in the first place. It fucks people up, I&#039;ve seen girls I know go from being so hot at 21/22 then going to H and looking about 50 by the time they&#039;re 30 and people injecting in their groins to find veins etc. <br /><br />You make your own decisions in life but my advice would be a resounding &quot;don&#039;t bother&quot;. <br />It&#039;s really not that special anyway if you ask me and the more you don&#039;t even get high any more and then you&#039;re graduating to speed balls and we go back to my last paragraph.
