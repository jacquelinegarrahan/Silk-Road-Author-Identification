				This jackass Nawlins said he shipped me a pkg and I never got it. I asked for a tracking number, tracking number says it was delivered in a state ten hours away. So I&#039;m thinking he got the tracking number wrong. <br /><br />However at this point, he will not communicate with me other than to tell me to take it up with Resolution center. I did that but tried to resolve amicably upon the way. No response. In the resolution I put exactly what I stated above, that I never got it and then the tracking number he gave me was for a place nowhere near me.<br /><br />Today I have a message waiting for me saying &quot;SR has resolved your transaction as 0% refund. We hope this is agreeable.&quot;<br /><br />WTF SR? Agreeable? What kind of shitty resolution center is that? I just got burned on an order, and I&#039;m supposed to be happy about it. Any advice here I would love to have. Every other transaction on SR has been a good one, this one sucked. <br /><br />BUYER BEWARE on NAWLINS. Which by the way brings up another thing, he has a ton of bad feedback, many griping the same thing as me, yet only the positive ones come up first when you click on him. Makes me think he is in bed with SR, how do only positive reviews show up? BS.

				I have had a couple orders from Nawlins with one being some 2C-B rolls and just a couple days ago my wonderful mailman delivered some Teacher&#039;s Pet MDMA. Sucks that the vendor wasn&#039;t more willing to work with you though.

				Teacher&#039;s Pet was what I ordered. I started small to test Nawlins and I was going to do a lot more business had it worked out, but it didn&#039;t. I don&#039;t gether he needs my business, but he literally missed out on thousands of dollars worth of business - oh well his loss.

				@ Mountain Cedar. I may have messed up a number or something, but not the city and town so forth of where I live. The tracking number was for ten states away, I didn&#039;t mess it up that bad. <br /><br />And I say he was &quot;in bed&quot; with SR bc the SR staff did absolutely nothing for me. What is the point of the resolution center? I didn&#039;t even get 25% back. So the only thing I can think of is they took his side because he has hundreds of transactions with them and I&#039;m a newbie. Hence he makes more money for them, so they side with him. Unless I missed some basic thing you are supposed to do, which is why I started this thread.<br /><br />@ Mister Stoner. When you click his name, only positive reviews show up. He has like a 99% positive feedback rating. But then if you scroll through pages and pages of reviews you find tons of reviews saying the same thing happened to them - no communication and no package ever arrived. I think it&#039;s very misleading to put only positive reviews up on front page. They ought to do it like Amazon - most recent positives and then most recent negatives.

				From your explanation my first thought is, &quot;well, then there must be more to the story&quot;<br /><br />Most of us that have been around a while know that Resolution staff wouldn&#039;t send that unless there is something missing from your OP, maybe SSBD is right and its your stats OR you missed some key piece of information out.<br /><br />Idk, but it can&#039;t be that simple. The vendor &quot;being in bed with SR Res staff&quot; is so highly unlikely thats its almost impossible.
