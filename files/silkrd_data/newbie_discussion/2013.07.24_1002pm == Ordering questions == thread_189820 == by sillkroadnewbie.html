				Hey Guys,<br />I have just recently found out about silk road and was instantly intrigued! I am not very tech-savy and am confused on how the ordering works.<br /><br />Can someone please explain me a step by step process of how ordering works?<br /><br />Also I am located in the US and only plan to order domestically but am very paranoid about getting items shipped to my house. How do I know I will not get in trouble by ordering something to my house.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hi,<br /><br />Welcome to SR!<br /><br />Make sure you read the Buyers Guide: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><br />Choose your favorite product, choose a reputable vendor. Start with relatively small transactions to build your buyer stats.<br /><br />Good luck!

				There are lots of good guides to help you get started, and the Buyers Guide is one of the best. If you&#039;re looking for a clearnet guide, check out the sidebar on www.reddit.com/r/silkroad. Most people seem to struggle the most with PGP but if you take the time to learn it, it&#039;s actually pretty simple. Without PGP it&#039;s much easier to get caught, so do yourself a favor and don&#039;t order from vendors who don&#039;t have a key.

				I Posted this elsewhere, reposting here:<br /><br />Step 1) You&#039;re going to want to find the specific vendor you want to buy from. Take into consideration price, transactions made, rating, # fans and very importantly, whether he/she requires an FE (Finalize Early).<br /><br />Step 2) Once you&#039;d found someone, you&#039;ll hit &quot;add to cart&quot;, just like any other online shopping website and you will proceed to checkout where it will show you the cost and a box where you are to put in specific information<br /><br />*****If you don&#039;t know how PGP Encryption works, I suggest you look into tutorials on it, because almost every vendor will require you to send the message with your personal info to be encrypted. *****<br /><br />Step 3) You will write down your address (With your real name and your real address) and encrypt it with the vendors PGP Key, and paste that into the box. Most vendors have a specific format you want to you, others have all sorts of buyer requirements, so make sure everything is in check before you send in your order.<br /><br />Step 4) Your order will be in progress until the vendor see&#039;s it, verifies, etc... The vendor will mark it &quot;In transit&quot; and you will then have 2 options from that point on: Resolve and Finalize. (Dont do either until you&#039;ve received your package, or you were requested to).<br /><br />Finalize: If you were required to FE, you would then finalize it, and leave feedback. What this will do is preemptively leave feedback and also release the money to the vendor.<br />Resolve: This will open up the resolution center where you have two options, request a refund, or extend the amount of days you want to wait before you believe the package will never arrive.<br /><br />Step 5) Wait. If you know where the package is coming from, look up shipping estimates and be patient. DON&#039;T WORRY. There is a very low chance your package has been compromised, but if it has, refer to this: http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=202568<br /><br />Step 6) Once you&#039;ve received the product, check to make sure it&#039;s what you ordered and then finalize and leave feedback!<br /><br />Things you should know before you buy:<br />PGP Encryption<br />Buyer requirements / Vendor specifics<br /><br /><br />This is just a summary of a step by step order.<br />Let me know if I missed anything!<br /><br />-TrippingSquares-<br />

				the most important thing is to use pgp encryption to communicate with vendors.<br /><br />Get pgp4usb, free download, incredibly to us. Lots of senior members here who will help you master it.
