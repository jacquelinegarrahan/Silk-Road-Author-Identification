				Yeah VICE is kind of a good doco series - although its not as reliable as other documentaries<br />but their krokodil one scared the shit out of me - no IV for this guy<br /><br />Drugs Inc. by national geographic has some good shit<br /><br />IF you&#039;re into psychadelics<br />look into Terrence Mckenna - God of Psychadelics<br />SHULGIN - God of RCs (research chemicals) and psychadelics - erowid is his...<br />Joe rogan provides his take on psychadelics - pretty interesting

				As another poster mentioned, the Vice Krokodil doc is a good one. http://www.vice.com/read/krokodil-tears-v18n9 (link to video is in article)<br /><br />I also recommend &quot;American Drug War: The Last White Hope&quot; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mcFg9LneKE
