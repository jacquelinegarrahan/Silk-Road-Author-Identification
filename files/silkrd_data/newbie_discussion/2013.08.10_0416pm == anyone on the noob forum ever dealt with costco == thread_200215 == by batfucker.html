				Costco has some good prices, shipping times, and quality of product.&nbsp; I would recommend buying form them.&nbsp; If you have low/no stats you might want to message them first.&nbsp; Costo replies pretty quickly and seems like an easily approachable vendor.

				From his profile - &quot;Your order will automatically be canceled if you have spent less than $500 on SR. If you have spent over $500 but less than $1000 on SR or if you have been on SR for less than 90 days contact me before you order so you donâ€™t waste either of our time.&quot;<br /><br />Good vendor, but I don&#039;t think a good first choice for a noob with no stats.&nbsp; He only sells larger quantities, so he isn&#039;t gonna risk getting scammed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read any vendor&#039;s profile carefully before you order - so you know their rules - i think if it&#039;s your first order - you are wasting your time at best - pissing off a large vendor at worst.&nbsp; Good luck with your 1st purchase.
