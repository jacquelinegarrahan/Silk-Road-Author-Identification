				Stumbled on your listing :) Have tried 6 SR coke vendors, will be a sampler for CannaConnection&#039;s new coke as well. I look forward to trying you out, Jean Ralphio, and will leave an appropriate review in the Rumor Mill when received and tested.<br /><br />Best,<br />~ozy

				Well I dont know what has happened to Jean-Ralphio?I have pm&#039;d him a few times with no reply but I did get the coke sample he promised to send so here goes with the review:<br /><br />Received a plain enough looking envelope from the USA on saturday,the postmark said that it was posted tuesday.USA-UK in 4 days,very fast post.upon opening I thought that I had received literature from a website that i might have looked at in the past but upon futher inspection found a vacuum sealed package.The stealth was excellent.I immediately weighed the baggy it was in and then opened it onto a mirror and weighed the baggy again.It was spot on 0.5gr of coke,which is what he promised.the coke was very powdery with tiny grains in so I chopped it a little and had a small line,about 0.05gr.I didnt get any sort of a high from this but my throat was very numb.10 minutes later I racked up a 0.1gr line and went out to wash my car.I still didnt get any sort of a high or even noticed higher energy levels,just a very numb throat.I decided the best thing to do with the rest of it would be to wash it back to crack which is what I did.when mixed with the ammonia I lost almost half of the 0.35gr I had left so washed again with water and left it to settle.In the end I got a small stone of about 0.15gr but when smoked on a pipe It was a very powerful rush,I nearly puked!It was also very clean tasting and left no crap on my pipe.It all melted down very nicely indeed.<br />If I were to get more of this coke from Jean,I wouldn&#039;t bother sniffing it,just wash back into crack.<br />To sum up I didn&#039;t think it was in anyway near to the 90%+ purity he said it was and it was definatly cut with something because of the amount lost whilst washing back.It makes great,clean crack but is no good for snorting.
