				So I&#039;m pretty new here and already wasted a few $ on paypal fees and virwox fees. <br /><br />As a new member, can I send my bitcoins from virwox to my coinbase once I sign up for it?<br /><br />Nub question, so we use our real names when signing up for coinbase right? and is it legit site that&#039;s similar to paypal?

				I use Coinbase for buying BTC. The major problem is that it takes 5 days to get BTC and recently it&#039;s been at its limit for purchases so I often cannot buy any. But it&#039;s easy and legit. You use your real name and you can link to your checking account. It&#039;s easy to send and receive BTC. Once it can handle more transactions I&#039;ll like it more, but it&#039;s a decent option in my opinion, mostly because it&#039;s easy to set up and use. I should also mention that I&#039;ve heard people talk about how their BTC purchases were deemed &quot;high-risk&quot; and cancelled (due to purchasing a large number of BTC and/or the price of BTC fluctuating a lot in a short amount of time).

And, for what it&#039;s worth, I made a small purchase from coinbase last night and there was no notice of limit. The five-day transfer, however, is still in effect.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to see if the purchase is made using the market rate from yesterday, or the market rate when the purchase is finalized.

				I just set up an account like 30 minutes ago! lol It was easy to set up. It said on the site that a regular limit is 10 BTC&#039;s a day. A more verified limit is 50 BTC&#039;s a day. FYI

				Friend has Coinbase, loves it. Much easier than setting up the Dwolla -&gt; Mt Gox route. I heard good thins from him and decided to get an account there too, it is easy but not practical if you need bitcoins RIGHT NOW because of a price change or a show just popped or, or, or...<br /><br />As far an anonymity goes (linking your name and bank account to your bitcoins), you can use a laundering service or send to mt gox.
