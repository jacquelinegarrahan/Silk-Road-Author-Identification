				I don&#039;t like the icons at all. But, the implementation of the multitasking, and quick settings/notification centre is great. I also really like the animations, and subtle changes (the clock app moves in real time, the weather animations, etc.) Those are the reasons why my device was jailbroken. I think I&#039;m going to keep the beta on for a few more weeks to see if I can put up with the easter egg colors, and if not, back to 6.1.2 I go!

If you need help on downgrading/upgrading or anything iOS like, or if you get stuck, hit me up with a private message and I can walk you through it step by step to perfect what you have in mind for your iDevice. WE all have to remember that we control our devices and not the other way around haha. I think a minimal version of iOS 7 would be nice, however I&#039;m sure with a little tweaking/theme variation I could get that on my own. What would be your perfect rendition of iOS 7? Because in all honesty the other versions of iOS were just tasteless and bland (albeit being simple and intuitive) so it&#039;s almost like I had to customize/jailbreak to get the phone I wish I could have straight out of the box.

				iOS 7 is still in a very rough beta (they still haven&#039;t finalized what the icons are going to look like). I&#039;m sure by the time its ready for an official release some time this fall it will be much better.
