				I got this message typed out on a yellow piece of paper:&nbsp; &quot;Please give this notice to a clerk during regular business hours. We are holding some of your mail for the reason(s) listed below:<br />1. The article is too large for your box. (5.5&quot;x11&quot; is the size of my box)<br />2. There is too much mail to fit in the box. (not the case)<br />3. Postage due. (highly doubt that is the case)<br />4. The mail requires a signature. (not the case with in priority mail I have ever recieved)&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I numbered them but they were boxes to be checked for the reason for having to see a clerk.&nbsp; None of the 4 boxes were checked.&nbsp; On top of that on the back of the blank side of the card were 5-6 other p.o. boxes that had been crossed through like they were recycling this piece of paper.&nbsp; There was nothing in my box prior to the order and it showed up at the time my shipment should have arrived.&nbsp; The vendor was 5 star rated but has had not logged on in 2 days which seems odd for a highly rated vendor with over 300 sales in 6 months.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sent 2 messages to the vendor and have yet to hear back.&nbsp; I feel like this post belongs in the shipping thread but I can&#039;t post there. Does anyone have any experience with this situation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought 7-9 items on SR and this is my first problem.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.<br />thanks

				It probably just didn&#039;t fit. Only way to find out is to go up and hand them the slip. I don&#039;t think it can hurt to ask.

				Well, presumably there is already some kind of documentation linking you to the PO box, at the very least someone there could identify you. You use the same excuse that anyone should use &#039;how am I supposed to know why some idiot thought it was cool to send me stuff, you can&#039;t hold me responsible &#039;. IMO it would be more suspicious to not go pick up a parcel they&#039;re holding for you - kinda indicates you know there might be something suspicious...&nbsp; :-\

				&quot;Ya I got this slip, are you sure it&#039;s the right box, I didn&#039;t order anything&quot;<br /><br />let them tell you what&#039;s up, and you can say Ya, I didn&#039;t order anything from them.

				First off thanks for the quick responses.&nbsp; As for the package not fitting&nbsp; any time that has happened in the past (non sr items) a key is left in my P.O. Box to retrieve the larger than my box allows package.&nbsp; Secondly it is only 100 valium and I have a large box.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never not had a package arrive so this is definitely new.&nbsp; Of the 4 reasons the only one it could be is postage due which is highly doubtful based on the rating of the seller.&nbsp; You (kittenfluff) are right there is documentation leading to me and I agree it does look suspicious that it is not being picked up with the exception I seldom use the box.&nbsp; It is for items I don&#039;t want left on my porch or SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read JanetReno&#039;s thread (the ex postal inspector) and from what I can gather the worst mistake I could make is to sign for it and walk out the door.&nbsp; It is USPS Priority that does not require a signature.&nbsp; By signing it I am opening myself up to a search of my car on the way home and my home when I get there.&nbsp; The frustrating part is the lack of communication from the vendor.&nbsp; I ordered on the 7th, package shipped on the 10th and my vendor has not logged in for 2 days.&nbsp; I have explained the situation in a message to see if the package may be too large or if he/she has any idea what may be going on since I was not given a tracking number/dcn.&nbsp; I am going to give it another 2 days to see if I get a response and then bite the bullet and not sign anything when I go to the teller.&nbsp; As they say denial is not just a river in Africa.&nbsp; Hopefully all is well and I&#039;m just being paranoid.&nbsp; Whatever happens I&#039;ll update this thread and again thanks for the input.

				Lol man, why are you trippin?&nbsp; That is completely normal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had hundreds of though.&nbsp; I only get them when I need to sign for something or if something is bigger than one foot by a foot and a half.&nbsp; Haha quit trippin!

				Hahaha it&#039;s just a hundred valium.&nbsp; They don&#039;t do shit for a three month supply or less of schedule five controlled substances.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had more than 22,000 schedule five pills seized lololol literally!&nbsp; I had a package with 1,200 xanax bars seized before.&nbsp; Chill out and go sign for your shit. :)

				Yeah I get a little yellow slip like that all the time.&nbsp; When you go to pick it up they shouldn&#039;t ask you to sign but if your really nervous then don&#039;t sign but I bet it&#039;s fine.

				Based on the comments it looks like I am earning my newbie title.&nbsp; I&#039;ll go pick it up tomorrow and see if they ask for a signature.

				They will ask for sig., just sign for the the package. It&#039;s exactly what a normal person would do.

				It&#039;s probably no big deal. If you are worried about a Controlled Delivery just don&#039;t sign for it. Say I have not ordered anything requiring a sig and walk away

				I picked up my package yesterday.&nbsp; I handed them the slip with the 4 options (none of which applied) and they shot the package with a bar scanner and said have a great day.&nbsp; If none of the 4 options applied I don&#039;t see why they didn&#039;t just put it in the p.o. box.&nbsp; The package was very discreet and included 2 xanax bars and an extra valium.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely feeling newbish on this order but out of 11 I&#039;ve never been through this.&nbsp; It&#039;s always been open the mail box and take out the package.&nbsp; Anyway it is all over and went well.&nbsp; I&#039;m 11 for 11 on SR.&nbsp; Hopefully the vendor got a laugh out of my paranoid message and won&#039;t hesitate to business with me again.&nbsp; Thanks again to all those who responded.&nbsp; You put my mind at ease better than what I ordered.<br />
