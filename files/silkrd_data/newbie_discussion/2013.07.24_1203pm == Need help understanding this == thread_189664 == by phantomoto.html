				Hello And Greetings<br /><br /><br />I contacted a BTC Vender here on SR and asked to buy a BTC He was nice enough to reply quickly by PM<br />And stated he would not sell to me because I didn&#039;t have any stats.<br />Why would this matter?<br />I understand a buyer being weary of a new contact.But A Seller ?If I give the money to him where&#039;s<br />the risk for him?I must be missing something right?<br />Thanks for any explanation on this matter.Thanks

				This does seem odd. I guess it depends on how you were going to get them the money.... If you were to send them cash, there would be zero risk for them, and 100% risk for you. If you were to send them money via PayPal, you could file a dispute after you received your BTC saying you never had and have your money refunded.<br /><br />

				The vendor&#039;s risk is that he has to *trust* an entity that has no buying history. If the buyer is honest, (most of the time they are), all goes well. Some percentage of of the time, though, the buyer claims to never have received the product, even though vendor shipped it, and the shipping rate of success for his shipping method is 99.99% effective.<br /><br />Now the vendor has to either <br />a) do full or partial refund (knowing full well the item was rec&#039;d); or<br />b) Go into time-consuming resolution; or<br />c) Receive threats by the buyer of leaving bad feedback. <br />&nbsp; (Even when bad feedback is unwarranted, it hurts the vendor&#039;s reputation.)<br />d) Do some drama involving messages, threads on forums (which vendor hopes to catch before wildfire starts)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All of these outcomes take up the vendor&#039;s time and tie up financial resources. Vendor can&#039;t re-up because he hasn&#039;t been paid. <br /><br />If a vendor turns away with a buyer with no stats, it&#039;s because he&#039;s decided these risks aren&#039;t worth the reward, or he&#039;s not in a position to be burned. This is why many vendors state that they&#039;ll deal with new buyers, but only in small amounts. If they get burned, they get burned less.<br />

				Maybe &quot;MedicineWoman&quot; thinks you were talking about buying substances off The Road. For which her opinion is pretty accurate. When it comes to BTC, it really is quite different.<br /><br />Just my opinion.

				Remember too that Bitcoins are not illegal and SR tumbles the coins before they get to your account on the road so the source of the coins is well protected. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about purchasing Bitcoins on the clearnet with your real information. Or, like someone has already posted, you can usually find good local Bitcoin dealers that will just take cash.

But there&#039;s one method which is risky for him. If he&#039;s relying on you to provide him with a valid MoneyPak code. This scenario:<br /><br />1. Buyer places order for 1 BTC, providing an INVALID MoneyPak code with the order<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This MoneyPak code has already been REDEEMED.<br />2. Vendor receives order, and tries to redeem MoneyPak code. Cannot do so.<br />3. Vendor contacts buyer, stating that the MoneyPak code was previously redeemed.<br />4. Buyer denies it.<br />5. Vendor now has to enter resolution, which ties up time and is no fun.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious -- is this how the vendor in question works -- with MoneyPak codes--or some other method?<br /><br />Peace,<br />MW
