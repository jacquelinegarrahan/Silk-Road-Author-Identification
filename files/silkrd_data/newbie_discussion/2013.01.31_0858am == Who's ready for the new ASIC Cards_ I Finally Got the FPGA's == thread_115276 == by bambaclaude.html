				I know I have mine pre-ordered. keeping a 60 GH/S one for me, another 60gh/s to sell and 10 4.5 GH/S ones all from butterfly lab.&nbsp; <br />Hoping i can in the first month/weeks earn atleast 100% more coin than normal, because right now i have a ATI card farm, i&#039;ve spent almost 2,000 on SR over 2 years and with these new cards I wanna save up and become a vendor finally so I can sell these FPGA 800Mh/S cards, i get em to do about 1.1 gh/s with some tweaks and have 10 to get rid of. I figure since both these are out of stock they would go fast but I dunno how to go about getting someone to fund my vendor account. I would sell the fpga&#039;s for $80-200USD and they are $500 each depending on if i sell em bulk or not. I did get the usb cables and the usb hubs for em so u can run all 10 at once at 8gh/s with tweak they can go to about 13gh/s at half the watts of one of the ATI&#039;s i have lol :) . I know my SR account would show anyone my perfect history and 0% auto and refund on around 50 transactions. Also would sling something else i wouldnt talk about here if I got a vendor, or got someone to vend for me. Hope the right person reads this. Please don&#039;t even let it cross your mind to msg me with non-sense. I might of just started the forum but I&#039;ve been a blah blah blah you&#039;ve heard it before ;) time for sleep, but yes i hope the right person reads this and something good can come out of it for both parties! <br /><br />I know we all like to get high on here but nothing better than getting high for free after this shit pays for itself. Thats my goal!

Does anyone click through a spam link?!&nbsp; ??? ???<br /><br />Actually, I feel the same way about internet adverts - I keep getting &#039;smart&#039; ads that simply advertise websites I already visit - what&#039;s the point of that?! Still, if it pays for stuff so I don&#039;t have to, I can ignore that shit....&nbsp; :-X
