				This post is half serious, half jest.<br /><br />Likewise it is half rant and half inquiry.<br /><br />I am interested in feedback from buyers but even more so from vendors, since this involves my buyer-vendor relations and I can only see it from the buyer perspective at the moment.<br /><br />So I placed an order last week and selected Express Mail as my shipping method for which I paid a premium. I had hoped to get the package to celebrate my birthday at midweek alas no dice. And now it looks like this weekend is a wash too.<br /><br />This tied up almost a whole BC with this vendor and I live paycheck to paycheck enough that I have little spare money to invest in such things idly. I am now flat broke until my next payday.<br /><br />My previous priority order with this vendor also had slow shipping times but clearly that issue was with the USPS who sent my mail the wrong direction and locked in a potal loop. <br /><br />The vendor also more than corrected for the issue even though I FE&#039;d not by request of the vender but through my own accidental stupidity.<br /><br />That was readily identified by tracking. Unfortunately I have no tracking for this. SilkRoad reports the package was marked in transit on Tuesday<br /><br />The vendor himself reports it was sent earlier like Sunday night into Monday. <br /><br />The vendor has fallen silent as well and has not as far as I can see even read my messages but he has been receiving steady positive reviews from others (though some also comment on the speed) . And an earlier conversation via torchat indicated he was being crushed underneath orders.<br /><br />This vendor is not fly by night by any means they have many many positive transactions over a long period. <br /><br />So how long should I reasonably wait for an express shipped package before feeling I am not getting the service I paid for? <br /><br />I value this vendor and his product and I hardly want to create a bad relationship with him. Worse given the way that buyer feedback is calculated and the fact that I am a newbie to SR entirely I fear killing my own rating so that other vendors wont deal with me. I do not live in a market where I have other sources, do not have the knowledge to find them anyway, and am old enough, having entered the pyschotropic haze later in life, that a street dealer would be a near impossibility anyway. <br /><br />Its a catch-22, but one I am sure I am in no way unique to.<br /><br />Of course, unless and until the seller becomes responsive,&nbsp; I have few options until resolution becomes available. <br /><br />Meaning that, irritatingly, even though I paid for express the time frame for such is very very long indeed. <br /><br />So how would you cope with such a situation?<br /><br />How would you handle the crushing weight of real life in light of such disappointment and depression?<br /><br />How would you occupy your time in light of the tremendous soul sucking boredom that crushed your&nbsp; mind?<br /><br />How would you deal with the vendor in this instance. <br /><br />Worse I am waiting on packages from another vendor too which is not here either (though that was free first class so I am unsurprised. But this means I am without psychotropic enhancement AT ALL! Woe is me. What am I to do?<br /><br />

				Baaah. That is a really rubbish situation. I&#039;m only a newbie buyer on here, so probably some thoughts from vendors will be helpful as you say.<br /><br />Sounds like you just have a slow vendor -- if others are commenting about the speed, and he&#039;s made no move to get you to FE, then perhaps he shipped it later than he said. Or perhaps you just got unlucky with the post again. Although a week for &quot;express&quot; delivery is slow, if this guy is inundated with orders he might not consider it a serious problem yet, or at least one that might go away if he ignores it. <br /><br />Does he post a policy on refunds/reships in his profile? Obviously you&#039;re out of pocket, but if he genuinely did send it then he is too.<br /><br />Mostly replying cos I really really sympathise with expecting goodies to arrive then having them not arrive. I waited 2 weeks for one vendor (not from SR), emailed them, they said &quot;I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll turn up&quot;. It did, 2 days later, and the tracking code showed they hadn&#039;t shipped it until after I emailed. Grr! That was two weekends that I was expecting to avoid sobriety. At least you have some other stuff on the way. Hopefully it&#039;ll all arrive soon!

				That sort of situation is what I fear though I have no reason at this point to suspect the vendor would do that. Unfortunately now he is not even responding so I have no way to know one way or the other. But given priority express has an overnight to second day guarantee we are at the limit of realistic patience I think. Worse express is expensive to the tune of&nbsp; a quarter BC expensive. Seems to me that for that price one expects.. oh I dunno the mail to arrive &quot;express&quot;

				Hey falerin.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I have all the answers for you but I&#039;ll try to give you my 2 cents based on experiences.&nbsp; <br /><br />First off it&#039;s a real bummer that you don&#039;t have tracking on DCN so you can track your package.&nbsp; I don&#039;t vend so I&#039;m not entirely sure how that works but I believe you have to walk into the post office to get the tracking and a lot of vendors don&#039;t want to do that and instead just drop it off in a blue box on a street corner.&nbsp; <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read on these forums the Express mail is supposedly handled by different people than who normally handles the regular first class and priority mail and I&#039;ve even read comments where people say the Express mail employees are much worse at their jobs than the normal employees (go figure right).&nbsp; <br /><br />The good news is all is not lost with your package.&nbsp; It could be and probably still is out there somewhere trying to be delivered to you.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve never had a package take forever before the first time it happens you&#039;re just thinking the worst and that all is lost.&nbsp; I had a priority package take 8 days about a month ago and I was getting pretty anxious.&nbsp; Only when I had given up hope that it was coming did it show up.&nbsp; So your package may still turn up.&nbsp; But in the future, you do what you want of course, but Express packages should be avoided if at all possible.&nbsp; They typically only get your package to you a day or two earlier and cost that much more but the biggest factor is how law enforcement looks at Express packages more closely for contraband.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible your package was discovered and destroyed.&nbsp; Typically you&#039;d get a letter regarding that though.&nbsp; <br /><br />To take care of your depression, this may not be your thing, but exercise is a great ally.&nbsp; It really gets your good chemicals flowing and makes you feel good and sleep good.&nbsp; Keep doing it on the daily and eat some good food and you won&#039;t feel depressed.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in the Northern Hemisphere, get out there and enjoy summer while it&#039;s still going on.&nbsp; Take a walk or a bike or just people watch at the park.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally in regards to the vendor, if you can&#039;t prove it was his fault the package didn&#039;t show I&#039;d give him the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Wait until the resolve button is available and then message the vendor saying perhaps you&#039;d like to give it a few more days and if the package doesn&#039;t show perhaps they&#039;d do a full refund or a reship.&nbsp; A lot of times the vendor puts their policy for refunds or reships in their profile.&nbsp; Considering you&#039;re living paycheck to paycheck I&#039;d be firm and push for a full refund or reship so you aren&#039;t out of pocket.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;
