				I recently made a purchase with the vendor &quot;WizardOfAussie&quot; and as of yesterday when ever I click on his account all I get is the send message to page. I am assuming he has put his account in holiday mode perhaps? But I am just wondering what the go is. I guess I will just wait for resolution and cancel but it is still a pain :/

				Same thing with Thurgood Jenkins vendor page ..... I strongly suspect that these vendors have either been banned or demoted. I know that a handful of TJ&#039;s customers got love letters....... and this may have something to do with his Ban ???&nbsp; If your package was marked in transit then you should be OK ..... By the way TJ was an awesome vendor.

				yeah I noticed that to with wizardofaussie.<br /><br />been waiting 2 weeks for my order to be delivered.. each week he told me there was sum issue and he&#039;d get it out asap. Last night infact he apologised again for the lateness and offered me a partial refund (I didn&#039;t ask for it)&nbsp; so I&#039;m abit curious why he&#039;s disappeared now. Seemed like a nice person, so not sure what the deal is. I&#039;ll. My order was very small and in escrow so not to concerned about that aspect. <br /><br />pretty sure he&#039;s not on vacation mode, that doesn&#039;t disable the vendor profile. <br />Is the only way a vendor profile disappears if they get banned, or can they unvendor themselves or something ?

				FYI, I&#039;m currently de-listed as a vendor according to VENDOR SUPPORT.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy as VS has forbidden refunds, compensation etc etc and as far as I&#039;m concerned, anybody utilizing the SUB-ACCOUNTS vendor feature is in an identical situation as it makes no sense that a sub-account can have identical privileges to the admin account. <br /><br />All those effected, I am aware of the situation but VS has specifically said I cannot follow through on a range of things due to a revoked vendor status. <br /><br />I&#039;m pleading my case as honesty is much more important in a vendor than scammer tactics like THIS ( https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=187565.0;topicseen ) personal experience.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep all effected up to date but as it stands, WOA vendor account is revoked.
