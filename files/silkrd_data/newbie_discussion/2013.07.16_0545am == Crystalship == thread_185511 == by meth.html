				I made an order more than two weeks ago for crystalship, and got express shipping. <br />Generally I receive express in about 5 days, the longest has been 12.<br /><br />He hasn&#039;t responded to any of my messages.<br /><br />Has anyone else had similar issues with him or am I being paranoid?

				Ive read some where, some time, that CS MAY be a selective scammer. Not confirmed though.<br /><br />There is a handful of reliable meth sellers on SR. I can recommend either FirstClassFix or TheDopeSpot.

				I&#039;m really glad I didn&#039;t FE,<br /><br />If you go through his feedback, you can see some people starting to changed their 5/5 FEs to negative feedback because they didn&#039;t get anything.<br /><br />I have only a few days left on resolution, I am going to ask for 100% back, <br /><br />Wish me luck finding a meth vendor who ships internationally and doesn&#039;t just try to rip you off.<br /><br />Maybe 5th vendor will be the lucky one -.-

				Silk road is good. It&#039;s just like with everywhere else, there is assholes.<br /><br />I have made around 50 ( I think) transactions on silkroad and only been scammed a handful of times. You just need to pick the vendor carefully, do some voodoo rituals and have good luck.<br />Meth vendors seems the most dodgy out of all of them. 3 out of the 5 or so times i have been ripped has been by meth vendors. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see why people can&#039;t just do what they advertise. (Ie, receive a set amount of money form you then ship a specified amount of drugs)<br /><br />Another day has ocme to an end with no mail for me.<br /><br />Has anyone had luck shipping from europe for meth?<br />I always feel like the german vendors are more suspect to customs.
