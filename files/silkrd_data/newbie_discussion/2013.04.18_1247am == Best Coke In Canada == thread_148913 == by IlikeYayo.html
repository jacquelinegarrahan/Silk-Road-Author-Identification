				Just wondering if anyone has tried multiple vendors located in Canada. Im going to be putting in a order in the next couple of days. Feedback would be great. I&#039;m doing my fair share of research before blowing my bitcoins cause I won&#039;t be a happy camper if I end up with weak coke cut with speed..Plenty of people to buy that crap from locally.

				Least speed has a little value still. I&#039;m not sure where about in Canada you are but the yayo that&#039;s in Toronto to st Catherine&#039;s seems to be hevealiy cut with a livestock deworming agent called lemasol or something like that.<br /><br />People say the high from it is coke like but less enjoyable with more side effects and clammy hands and some &quot;scalp tingling&quot;<br /><br />So if your around those areas at all and your getting a decent amount it might be worth getting some tests for dangerous cuts. I think it&#039;s coming into the country cut like that instead of being done lower down so it could &#039;ve more wide spread then I thought
