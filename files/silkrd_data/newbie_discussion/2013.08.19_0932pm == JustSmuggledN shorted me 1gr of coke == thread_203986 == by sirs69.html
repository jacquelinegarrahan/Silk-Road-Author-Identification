				I would hope that you have messaged the vendor and at least got an answer back/waited till the message was read.<br /><br />Vendors are human, and humans make mistakes. Reputable ones will generally accept errors are fix them as needed.

				Dude, there&#039;s a difference between ripping someone off and making a mistake. You said &quot;shorted&quot; , so you got part of your order , right?? WhyTF would he send you anything at all if trying to burn ya? You should communicate with any vendor about an issue like this B4 shouting &quot;SCAM!!&quot;<br />I know JSN is a relatively new vendor and , because of his very competitive prices, and his quality, he&#039;s swamped and a bit overwhelmed . He&#039;s treated me right, I&#039;m on my 2nd order with him. Give the dude a chance to make right, what are the details??? What did ya order and what didja get??

				Chill out , he didn&#039;t rip you off. If you read his review thread, he does have issues returning PM&#039;s . Everyone over there has the same problem, but, they&#039;re all still getting their product. I ordered some C last Thursday, paid for express , and it just got put in transit today. His vendor page says orders should go out in 24 hrs . Why??? Not becayuse he&#039; a theif, because he&#039;s busy and underestimated the work involved in being a busy vendor. Why don&#039;t you put yoyur energy towards getting 50 posts so you can get out of this newbie shit and then go to that thread and talk to him, he&#039;ll see it. And don&#039;t make yourself sound like a spoiled little pissant 16 yr old who got the wrong color transformer at Christmas.<br />Shit happens, these are drug deals, they always get fucked up IRL and same here. By the way, JSN&#039;s product rocks,/.
