				Hi.. <br /><br />So i have just set up my account. I had bought some bitcoins through the third party ppl.. coinjar. anyway ive sent my money to the address it gave me when i clicked on make a deposit... now how long does it usually take to appear? also i didnt change my pin and that before hand..&nbsp; i have since changed it though..<br />so i guess my main question is how long does it usually take to appear?<br />thanks in advance. and if anyone can point me in the right direction to a different third party to get coins then let me know..<br />thanks !!<br /><br />Also i am in australia.. would it be safest to buy products domestic? thanks.

				Depends how busy the blockchan is. Can take as little as an hour or two all the way to 12 hours. Also tor speed is a factor. My first time was about 4=6 and I was getting impatient as hell lol.<br /><br />The reason, I believe, for changing password and pin, is simply to confirm you know them, no other reason. This isn&#039;t like ijerkoff.com where you can have them send a link to reset to your email =)<br /><br />Coinbase, mt.gox, camp bx. There&#039;s hundreds. Ebay if you are desperate. Suggestion though, don&#039;t send your coins directly to the road. Send them to at least one wallet before the road.<br /><br />Domestic is always best, no customs to worry about. And remember, Australia is the only country with a Silk Road vendor bust.

				it usually doesn&#039;t take longer than 1 or&nbsp; 2 hours but it can take up to six.<br /><br />localbitcoins.com is a great place to get coins.<br /><br /><br />since your customs are really bad i would recommend buying domestic. <br /><br />cheers<br />

				http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/01/silk-road-crackdown<br /><br />Don&#039;t visit that from tor.<br /><br />The bust was due to him having many large shipments going through customs.<br /><br />Small shit, you are probably fine with though, but domestic is still safer, and faster.

				hi gem, Im in au also and am currently using bit trade australia for my BTC purchases. I was using bit innovate till they stopped dealing with BTC but these guys have been good so far. Have not waited longer than 3hrs in about 6-8 transactions from bank deposit till it was in my wallet. looked into coinjar when bit innovate stopped but they were asking for way to much info. these guys dont even ask your name, just email and wallet.<br />also dont believe the hype about our customs being any more efficient than anywhere else in the world. I have been using SR for about 4 mths and have received no less than 1 and up to 4 orders a week originating from international locations and have not had 1 seizure. admittedly they are all small amounts but I dont think SR is really for commercial quantity purchases. forgive me if im wrong. the au &quot;busts&quot; in the media where guys that had bad irl practices and brought le attention to themselves then where caught with envelopes containing drugs that were addressed to different locations then made full admissions. nothing to do with our sophisticated detection methods.<br />SR has been a godsend for me. I havnt used huge amounts of drugs for some time now and since SR my usage has not decreased, but I am spending about 25% what I used to and probably getting 75% better quality. I wouldnt buy kilos of smack from thailand through the mail but a gram or two a week from the US hasnt been a problem for me so far... I hope I didnt just jinx myself
