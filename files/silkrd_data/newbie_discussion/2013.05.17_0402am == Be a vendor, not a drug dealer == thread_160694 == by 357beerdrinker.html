				With the amount of effort it takes to setup a vendor account, I&#039;m surprised I still experience vendors acting like street drug dealers.&nbsp; Vendors don&#039;t update their own vendor page and yet still expect buyers to be held accountable to their rules.&nbsp; If you say you ship within &quot;x amount of days&quot; then live up to it.&nbsp; Shit happens especially when dealing with drugs.&nbsp; Just communicate with your buyers and let them know what&#039;s up, not bullshit them with made up excuses.&nbsp; If you ran out of product, just say so and ask if they&#039;d like their order cancelled but provide some incentive to keep their business like a free .1 gram or something.&nbsp; I&#039;d consider to continue doing business with someone that said &quot;hey, we got slammed with a lot of orders and couldn&#039;t pull our listing fast enough.&nbsp; Yours was one of the last and we are unable to fill it at this time.&nbsp; How about we work something out?&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s better than pissing off a buyer and getting your vendor rating hurt by a bad score.<br /><br />

				You should become a vendor to, because its so easy. And if you run a day behind, give away your product for free if someone whines about why their $20 order isn&#039;t getting the hourly update. I wonder why my partner and I have never thought of this before!! Oh wait...

				I have neither the inclination nor ability to become a vendor.&nbsp; Being on the selling end of this business is far from easy.&nbsp; I get it, shit happens that you don&#039;t expect.&nbsp; Just be up front with the people you consider your customers.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think proper communication is too much to ask especially when it&#039;s one of the things people talk about and rate vendors on pretty consistently.&nbsp; If I send a personalized message not even asking about where my package is or anything related, at least read it and not send me back some bullshit reply that was just a copy/paste.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t expect any real-time update but if you know there&#039;s an issue and have a cookie cutter response ready to be pasted into a message, take the few minutes to put the info on your vendor page.&nbsp; Some of us will look there to see if there are any updates since this is pretty common practice with vendors.&nbsp; I&#039;m in no hurry, this is a recreational activity for me but there&#039;s still money involved and should be treated as business.<br /><br />Grass4Cash, I appreciate the products you offer that aren&#039;t supported here on the site any longer.&nbsp; &nbsp;You took the time on another one of your posts to inform potentially interested buyers of your current status.&nbsp; That&#039;s just being a good member of the community and a professional.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Ideally a vendor should be able to reply to every single PM they get. However when they start receiving 100+ PMs a day, responding to each and every request/message and giving them a personal touch is just unrealistic. Most vendors (My self included) have jobs/business outside of the darknet. Especially on SR&#039;s speed, I remember I tried to update my profile on SR and I got booted off of the site after I spent 20-30 minutes typing up new features/updates. Imagine reading/responding to 100 messages.... or 200 messages or more a day! It would take hours just to open all the messages. <br /><br />Just remember to have realistic expectations ;)

				Is it realistic for someone who visits a Dr. monthly to set up a vendor account just for the sake of getting rid of about 60 adderall a months, or 40 suboxone?&nbsp; Just curious.&nbsp; Are you expected to have a large stock of items starting off and throughout vending carreer
