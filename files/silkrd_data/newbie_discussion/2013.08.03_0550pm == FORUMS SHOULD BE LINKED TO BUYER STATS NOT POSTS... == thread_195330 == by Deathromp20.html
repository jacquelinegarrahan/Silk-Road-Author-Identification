				you know that old refrain....action speaks louder than words...well we should stick to that here on the road...rather than &quot;spamming&quot; your way to 50 posts to be granted access......I think it would be fair and very telling if a buyers stats paralleled his/her forum stats....in other words...access would no longer be granted via &#039;chatter&#039; but rather by a consistently honest track record on the road--of successful purchases.. 0 returns...ect. I dont see why this system doesnt work this way....it seems highly unbalanced- if someone were to post consistently and frequently on the forums it could be telling of age or other factors which may not necessarily match their buyer stats...at all...yet given some rank or credibility when reviewing products.&nbsp; this probably wont be seen- or acted upon but worth a try...

				HELTER...- thanks for reading/responding to post...may I ask why you prefer the two to be separate? You probably have good reason...reasons I havent thought of and maybe you + DPR have considered them... just wondering. I rarely post on the forums..although every once in a while I get the urge to praise a vendor and his/her goods...and am quickly discouraged by the lack of access to the larger-more varied topics.... <br /><br /><br />

				I think it is because&nbsp; i am paranoid about the man using what i say in the forum against me should i get busted using SR. probably worrying too much but this whole site is well shady and sadly i think it is only a matter of time before the dream ends and there may well be a shit storm for us users.

The reason why DRP will not post a response here, on this topic, would be redundancy. As Helter implies above, forum names and silk road buyer stats are not, and should not be connected for personal SECURITY reasons.&nbsp; Think about it, if forum rank went by buyer stats and NOT by number of posts, then those of us who spend millions on here would be widely known &quot;personalities&quot; to varies Authorities. <br /><br />People like to be able to come on here to discuss various concerns and practices without revealing who we are, and how much money we actually spend on Silk Road.&nbsp; Granted; there are a few silly members who wear their purchasing stats like some badge of coolness --but really, it just makes you more of a target.<br /><br />Not to mention, this is run on an entirely different server, also for security purposes. <br /><br />The better question to being asking... well, only yourself, would be &#039;Why am I not thinking about my own personal Security first?&#039;

				So people who are very helpful to the community, but do not engage in too much actual commerce on SR should just be shunned? When you look at it that way your statement seems almost foolish doesn&#039;t it?

The 50 post rule was put in place to eliminate or reduce the spam problems we were having on this forum. How someone gains full access to the forum to prove they are not a spam bot should not tell a vendor anything. Fortunately I never had to go through a 50 post newbie trial period, but just because someone does the bare minimum to achieve their proof or being real does not make them a selfish or greedy person.<br /><br />Someone who does a &quot;spam to 50&quot; should once they reach 150 posts go back and delete their first 50 &quot;spam&quot; posts IMO. For their own good as well as to clean up the forum Or OP&#039;s who initiate &quot;SPAM to 50&quot; posts should delete them after a set amount of time. That way anyone who used that method and did not contribute much afterwards will lose their privileges again and those who continued to contribute will be unaffected.

				The forum is a totally different animal than the marketplace.<br /><br />I see what the OP is saying, but I disagree because modding a forum is a big job.&nbsp; The 50 posts rule is put in place to prevent spam.&nbsp; Also, it seems, the 50 posts rule is a good idea to get people to talk about the SR before new people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about clog up the other parts of the forum.

				I like the disconnect between the forum and SR but the post minimum is BS. Post minimums encourage spamming and have nothing to do with content quality.
