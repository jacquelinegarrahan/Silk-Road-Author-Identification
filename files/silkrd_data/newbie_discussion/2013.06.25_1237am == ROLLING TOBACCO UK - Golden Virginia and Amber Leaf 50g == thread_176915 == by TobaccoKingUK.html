				Hi I am considering becoming a vendor on SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;I sell rolling tobacco, Golden Virginia and Amber Leaf in 50g pouches. <br /><br />The tobacco is from Gibraltar and brought into the UK. This is advantageous for three reasons. It is cheap so I am able to offer customers great prices. As Gibraltar is an English colony the writing on the packs is all in English. Lastly, I get it brought into the UK ready to ship from here. This is good as the main cigarette seller on SR from Moldova who doesn&#039;t even do rolling tobacco cannot guarantee delivery to the UK because Customs are so bad here.<br /><br />Would many people be interested in this? Prices would start around £10 a pouch with discounts for bulk buys... (Tesco price for Golden Virginia is around £17)

				I just rolled my first cigarette this weekend and it was lovely. As a pro joint roller, I even found it a bit of a challenge. 10 pounds for 50g sounds pretty great, pretty much 3x the cigs for the dollar here in Canada. Would you ship outside the UK?

				I would also offer big discounts for bulk purchases for people who want to sell on in their local pubs/bars. Lets say orders of 100+ pouches I could do at around £7.50 and prices for everything in between.

				There is only one other seller on SR at the moment selling tobacco despatched from the UK, they currently sell GV pouches but are 25g pouches.<br /><br />If you look in the tobacco section the user is called&nbsp; &#039;Smokeables&#039;

				Haha I call em sleaves. Got ya! Yeah there is a defo a demand for that but I only get tobacco. Cigs are detected a lot easier by Customs you see. If I can locate someone bringing them in on mass via the ports I may consider buying to list. However, as far as myself is concerned I just get the tobacco

				If you do also have any way of getting counterfeit cigarettes I would pay way for B&amp;H silver or B&amp;H gold. Unfortunately I have never seen anyone offering it on here and the guy I buy it from down the pub is unreliable as hell and keeps trying to flog me DVD&#039;s after I have purchased the cigarettes so I&#039;m not usually making any savings&nbsp; &gt;:(

				No I only sell the real deal mate. So yeah forget that £7-8 stuff you get on the street that is half the time Chinese fake shite. This is 100% real deal GV and Amber Leaf with English writing direct from Gibraltar!<br /><br />I am quite happy about the responses so far and the interest looks good. Anyone else?
