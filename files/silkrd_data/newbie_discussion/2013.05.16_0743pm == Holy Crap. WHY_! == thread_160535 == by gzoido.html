				So I was here a while ago and there wasn&#039;t a need to 50 posts to post on other threads. Oh well, I guess I shall make this my thread to allocate spam. Although I have posts already in different forums. -_-

				Maybe this should be explained in a sticky (isn&#039;t it?), but obviously there is a reason for this. Why would they have you post to 50 for no reason? They wouldn&#039;t, and they didn&#039;t for about 2 years leading up until now.<br /><br />You see, back in the old days (2012), we used to get a lot of spam on the main boards. A lot. of spam. So much so it was difficult to even post anything or engage in any sort of discourse. It was seriously disrupting the forums. The mods were breaking their backs deleting every instance of spam, but it still wasn&#039;t good enough. And when the mods weren&#039;t around, it was horrendous. This 50 post count requirement is a necessary evil to keep the boards in line and everything operating smoothly. Those who DON&#039;T intend to hurt SR with their presence, will get a 50 post count here and continue on to converse with the rest of the community.<br /><br />Fun fact: The spam was also actually a SCAM. That is, a fake btc transfer operation that stole people&#039;s money. Mtgix, I believe it was..

				the 50 post min makes sense to prevent time wasters, despite it being a real pain.
