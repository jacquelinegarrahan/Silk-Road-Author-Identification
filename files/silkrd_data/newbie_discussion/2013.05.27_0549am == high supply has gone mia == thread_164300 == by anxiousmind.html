				PM a mod like Scout or Libertas. Find one of their posts on any thread, click on their name, and from there you can PM them with your concerns. They actively encourage it to keep SR and the forum&#039;s integrity for the benefit of all.<br /><br />Hope you get it sorted.

If that was their name then that vendor has been stripped of their vending privileges. If you are still in escrow, hit the resolution button and request a 100% refund. Refunds given in instances where a vendor has been stripped of their vending privileges do not affect your purchasing stats.<br /><br />If you FE&#039;d then there is unfortunately nothing that can be done - the escrow system is there for your protection, and Silk Road advises all customers never to FE.<br /><br />Libertas

				Ah - when a vendor has not logged in for 72 hours their listings are taken down automatically. Given that the vendor hasn&#039;t logged in for 13 days and the last 5 reports are buyers stating that they did not receive anything, I would strongly recommend you take the order to resolution and request a 100% refund.<br /><br />There are many reasons why vendors don&#039;t log in, but if your order hasn&#039;t arrived yet and others have reported the same thing, I think it&#039;s safe to assume that your product isn&#039;t coming.<br /><br />Libertas
