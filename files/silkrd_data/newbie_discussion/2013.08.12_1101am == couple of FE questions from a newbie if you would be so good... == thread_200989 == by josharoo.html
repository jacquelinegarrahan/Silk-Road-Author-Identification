				Hi, firstly just want to say how blown away I am that places like this exist - never even heard of SR or Tor or BTC or any of that jazz until a couple of weeks ago, lurked and learned for a while and kind of got my head around it enough, I figured, to give it a go, s-o-o-o..... Hopefully a little package now winging its way towards me :D ..... Thanks heaps to all the movers and shakers there on SR who get all this stuff happening. <br /><br />Couple of questions if I may, and I appreciate very much any responses: We&#039;re told not to FE early - no FE was requested when I ordered what I did, yet in the customer reviews I read many comments like, &#039;FE, very exciting&#039;, &#039;FE as requested&#039;, &#039;FE for trusted seller&#039;. So all these people are apparently willing to take the risk? Is there really much of a risk? How come they all seem so blase about it? How come I haven&#039;t been asked to FE (on this, my first ever purchase)? Will I be asked to FE down the track a bit (just ordered today)? (OK, sorry, that&#039;s more than a couple of questions, but heh, trying to get my head around a lot of stuff! Thanks again...

				When a product is shipped, as long as you haven&#039;t FE, your bitcoin remains safely in escrow in the event the seller is trying to scam you. Basically you pay your BTC to SR, which holds on to the funds, until you finalize the order. Ideally, you finalize your order when you receive your product, and SR releases the funds to the seller. <br /><br />Many times you&#039;ll see &quot;FE trusted seller&quot; because the buyer might be sitting on the package for a few days before retrieving it. Some vendors might not appreciate the product reaching it&#039;s destination and still not receiving their payment. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take this as a sign that just because you buy from someone for a very long time and you trust them that you might not get scammed. tony76 man. Look into that story. The short of it is he was a very very well trusted and major vendor on the road, one day announced a huge sale, and requested all of his customers FE on their purchases. Lo and behold, no one ever received their products, and because every order was FE, they couldn&#039;t get their BTC back. Maybe he took the money and ran, maybe he got arrested, who knows.<br /><br />Moral of the story, never, ever, ever FE. There are plenty of vendors that do not require FE for new buyers. One more tip, no such thing as reading too much. You can never spend too much time reading the forums for new information and arming yourself with knowledge. <br /><br />Hope this helped :)<br />

				6 orders. Never been asked to FE. All arrived quickly, and as advertised. Fan-fuckin-tastic place. No reason to FE, someone else will have the same product. Look around and research your seller.

				Weeell I obviously did a noob mistake and promised to FE today, although Nevita seems to be a trusted seller.. I KNOW I KNOW; there&#039;s no such thing as a trusted seller, when will I ever learn. It&#039;s my first purchase so really want it to be successful :) <br /><br />Loving sr and tor, been sat all day going through some random directories looking at all the strange stuff that can be found lol.<br /><br />boom!

				FEing is ultimately useless at the moment. Yes if the bitcoin is tanking while your shit is in the mail and the vendor is trusted you might want to FE just to be a nice guy.<br /><br />At the moment and actually for a while now the bitcoin has been steady as fuck maybe going up or down a few dollars but that is the risk vendors take here. Unless the bitcoin is going from $100 to $50 then no FEing.
