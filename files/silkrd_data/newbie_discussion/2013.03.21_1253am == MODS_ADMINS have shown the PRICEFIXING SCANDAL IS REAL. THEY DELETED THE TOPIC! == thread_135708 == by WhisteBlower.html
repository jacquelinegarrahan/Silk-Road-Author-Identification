				Looks like the Mods and Admins are determined to protect the Vendors who have been colluding and price fixing to keep prices high. Wow. They deleted my thread. I got atleast 20 private messages of people interested in proof and I have started disseminating it. It shows how high up the ladder corruption here goes. Wake up people, wake up. Ok, since theyre going to play hardball so will I. <br /><br />Email me at &quot;Whistleblower@tormail.org&quot; I will send you details and evidence from the Vendor Forum on how the top Coke, Rx, Heroin, MDMA vendors are colluding on prices and how the SR head honchos not only encourage by reward this behavior. The battle lines have been drawn. <br /><br />Such a tragedy how my thread got deleted. You can silence one man but you can never silence the truth. Put an end to these artificially inflated prices and bring these corrupt vendors and their SR enablers to task. Allow newbie vendors with cheaper prices for their product to get a chance to vend too.<br /><br />THIS DEBACLE HAS JUST BEGUN. THEY TRIED TO CENSOR MY VOICE, THEY CANT CENSOR MY EVIDENCE. I HAVE IT IN TORMAIL.

				Damn and I still love the MDMA prices. Bing is cheaper where I am locally, and so is acid (when it issss around which is pretty much never) but MDMA is never cheaper. I would gamble that they set prices for expensive things like bing but maybe not mandy i mean if they are I dont even care. We cant stop them

				It&#039;s not publicly known. It&#039;s only recently coming to light. It started with the other guys post in the silk road subforum about Nod price fixing on coke and then I had been working on my own investigation into this.

Tell me why the cheaper priced vendors get fucked over while you guys price fix? You admitted to me on PM that you all hav been price fixing together, and when I pasted it here the thread mysteriously vanished. <br /><br />The buyers will boycott and go to the cheaper vendors.

You might note that my first post on this matter was the entirety of your PM to me and my laughing response to it.<br /><br />Secondly, as I said in another thread, this IS and illegal marketplace and there are no &quot;rules&quot; against price-fixing AND the prices here are greatly lower than in many areas of the USA because most of my buyers resell IRL.<br /><br />Thirdly, pull your head out of your ass fool and stop trying to sound cool like me by using words like &quot;loquacious.&quot;<br /><br />Lastly, you have one thing right, I am a corrupt vendor. I vend illegal shit and that&#039;s pretty corrupt, no?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if mods moved your post and you can&#039;t find it, or even deleted it. I don&#039;t know the difference between a mod and an admin. I don&#039;t know any either so nuf on that.<br /><br />I see other vendors with lower prices than me. But my people buy from me because they like me motherfucker. People like me. Would you like me to describe what that feels like?

Yes, people seem to like you so much so that you currently don&#039;t have any listings up, and you were trying to collude and intimidate a prospective vendor the other night via PM and buying up his cheap stock of Rx so that you can re-sell here for 2x profit.

				Because a lot of things go on behind the scenes Scout. A friend of a friend wanted to become a vendor the other day.. and was even gauging interest in potential prices for a product thats currently overpriced.<br />Our friend Modzi.. without getting into specifics.. immediately set into motion a plan to run the guy out of business even before he started and .. surprise surprise.. reveal his greedy designs to keep the prices fixed. Let&#039;s just say that DPR vindicated that his has been going on.<br /><br />Also, DPR says he won&#039;t do anything to breakup these cartels. There are two cartels currently operating. Overpriced Coke and Overpriced Pain Pills. But DPR, if you can read between the lines, makes it clear he doesn&#039;t exactly feel its a positive thing. He said he will let it be.. but a retard can sense he finds it a bit reprehensible and counter to the free market principles we have around here.<br /><br />Anyways.. I am glad that this scandal has been uncovered and the Boss Dawg DPR himself addressed it, and CORROBRATED what these guys are doing.<br /><br />Scout - as you can see in DPR&#039;s message, if any vendors want to whistlebow and/or re-paste vendor-forum information here it&#039;s fair game. I assume further whitleblowing on collusion and organized price gouging, if reproduced here, would not be swept under the rug anymore sir?

				It took a moron to misread and reinterpret what DPR and Scout have clearly stated. That cartels may be attempted and are fine, if difficult. <br /><br />Regarding your &quot;friend of a friend&quot; he asked me to buy his whole stock and I gladly agreed to put a plan together. Why? So that I may bring his product to SR because the guy was not a vendor and didn&#039;t want to deal with the hassles like having to talk to a foolish derp like you, DickBlower.<br /><br />And if you are indeed that guy, then good luck being successful you pompous and insufferably ignorant ass.<br /><br />Modzi

				Modziw, I wouldn&#039;t even bother responding to this troll if I were you. I think he&#039;s definetly desperate for attention and provoking Scout or you or RxKing etc.. he is just trying to get 15 minutes of fame.<br />Have not done business with you yet, but I&#039;ve done business with some of the other RX vendors and they speak highly you and each other. <br /><br />To the &quot;Whistle Blower&quot; who can not spell his own name properly - You are completely wrong. DPR has not &quot;vindicated&quot; anything. You obviously&nbsp; have some personal bone to pick, or you simply can&#039;t afford to buy the drugs you want. Sucks for you bro.&nbsp; I usually buy from the RX vendors. I don&#039;t think anyone of these guys&#039; prices (and btw, they&#039;re all different to some degree.. so nothing is &quot;fixed&quot;) is astronomical. In fact most of them are charging less then IRL dealers charge, without the hassle of driving, waiting, driving around carrying narcotics. You press a few buttons and a couple days later a fucking package arrives at your house with exactly what you wanted without fail. Now, if you find the prices are too high.. then you should stop doing drugs! I can afford it, so I&#039;m glad to pay whatever they charge. If the prices even went up a few bucks.. I&#039;d still buy from them because I can afford to and I love getting high. That&#039;s the beauty of this place. If they&#039;re getting together to &quot;price fix&quot;, who gives a fuck? We still get our drugs, we get great customer service, we get privacy, anonymity and peace of mind. That alone is worth a premium. You don&#039;t think commodities like milk, gasoline, cigarettes, etc are all fixed prices? <br /><br />There is no scandal here man.. you need to lay off the bath salts. And even if they were all colluding in some secret attempt to form a cartel, so? Cartels are fucking cool, dude. Don&#039;t you watch movies? Cartels are badass as it is. I&#039;d love to see some cartels here. <br /><br />This entire circus started because a vendor reproduced something from the vendor forums here. The only thing of DPR&#039;s post that I didn&#039;t like was that he said they will stop trying to remove vendor-forum-only-info from being posted here. I actually think that&#039;s not the best idea. Whatever the vendors do and discuss, it&#039;s best left OUT of here. I don&#039;t want stealth techniques and other security sensitive discussions being strewn about this place. There is LE here for sure. There might be LE in the vendor forums but it&#039;s either unlikely or negligible since LE is not about to setup a vendor account and start selling drugs for fun. <br /><br />As for bitching at the mods and admins for deleting posts that are clearly meant to instigate some kind of backlash towards certain vendors.. I wish the mods straight up BANNED people who are screaming like they&#039;ve been chainsmoking meth for 48 hours. If you have an issue with some vendors prices you have 3 options : 1) Don&#039;t buy from that vendor&nbsp; 2)Make more money so you can afford the drugs you want but cant afford 3) Become a fucking vendor yourself<br /><br />

				I&#039;m very curious how this will all play out. What we have here is a rare economics experiment where cartels form in a largely unregulated yet massive internet black market. Can cartels exist successfully when strong cryptography makes it difficult for them to use physical violence against non-compliant vendors? What tactics will they use to maintain their marketplace dominence? Will they be effective? However this turns out will impact free market discussions in the future.

Let&#039;s not do that. When he runs out we will get prices for our stuff that will keep us in business. And we agreed and then pretty much didn&#039;t change a thing but we didn&#039;t get into any price wars and we kept selling to happy customers who NEVER complain about the price, by the way.<br /><br />Yep that&#039;s some baaaad ass cartel we got going on.<br /><br />Modzi

				Man I want to see some cartel war here. Like the Coke vendors form a cartel and fight it out with the Oxy cartel. The MDMA cartel is forced to choose sides. The bud cartel plays both sides.. lamborghinis, coked up strippers, shootouts on boats. Some fucking Miami Vice shit on the Road.
