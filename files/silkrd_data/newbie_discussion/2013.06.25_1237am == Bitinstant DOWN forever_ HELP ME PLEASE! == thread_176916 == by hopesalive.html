				What do I do now? I knew it was way too easy, lol. Bitinstant was SO easy, now I have no idea what I am going to do do.<br /><br />I wanted to place an order on Wed and receive on Friday. This is VERY important, because I am leaving town on Saturday and I need something to bring me with me or I will be one suffering person.<br /><br />Can anyone help me figure out another way?&nbsp; I need an instant way to get my bitcoin and place an order on Wed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any assistance is sincerely appreciated.<br /><br />Thank&nbsp; you in advance!

				What other services have you tried? I&#039;ve been using CoinBase for quite some time, but they&#039;re slow as hell (takes several days).<br />I&#039;ve heard that LocalBitCoins is good, if you live in a populous enough area.

				yup, that&#039;s the BitInstant site, alright.<br /><br />&quot;Time is Money&quot;<br /><br />...if you check the security forum (and places like BitCoinTalk), you&#039;ll find that they&#039;ve had a great many problems since upgrading to their new site. All reports are that your BitCoins DO arrive, but the delays were many days up to a week. Go check ClearNet for BitCoinTalk and do a general search for BitInstant over the last 24-48 hrs.

Made 2 transactions in the last week with them, and both times had my coins within a couple hours, with confirmation emails and blockchain tracking info. also completely annonymous bank deposits!<br /><br />only thing is....if you need $50 in BTC....add a lil more....like a total of $56 cuz they will set up your deposit for $50 and they will take their fees out of that, and you wont get $50 youll get more like $45. their fees are cheap(&lt;10%), but if your asking for exactly how much you need....add a lil more for their fees.<br />
