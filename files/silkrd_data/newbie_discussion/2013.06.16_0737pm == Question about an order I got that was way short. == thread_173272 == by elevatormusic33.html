				I posted about this a couple of days ago, but it was deleted...idk why?<br /><br />Anyway, I ordered 2 ounces from a pretty reputable vendor a couple of weeks ago. It was 2 ounces of greenhouse sour OG. Well, what I got, in a small priority mail box, was one ounce of crap IMO, and 5 or 6 grams of this crap was shake and stems. Now, I&#039;m not here to vent about the quality. It is what it is, a gamble I took ordering weed from a complete stranger. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;My complaint is the missing ounce. Someone said on my last thread to make sure I was accurate with the weight. Come on. The one ounce was marked &quot;whole 28g&quot;. And I have accurate scales. I&#039;m talking about 28g missing. Not just one or two. <br />&nbsp; So I sent many messages to thd vendor, being very polite and asking what he wants to do about this. I proposed he refund the other ounce instead of a re-ship, because of the quality, but at this point I&#039;ll take anything.&nbsp; Now, since all this has happened the vendor had gone into stealth, and posted on his page apologizing to all his customers about some shipping mixup with USPS. He&#039;s assuring all his customers that as long as they haven&#039;t FE their money is safe. <br />&nbsp; Well, I finally get a response from him personally yesterday, and it was a privnote message stating that after careful review of the DCN number and the box it was shipped in(?) he has determined that 2 ounces were sent and no refund would be given at this time. Really? So I&#039;m a liar?&nbsp; You&#039;re having all these problems now, forced to go stealth to address everything, sending out a mass apology...and I&#039;m the one who fucked up??? Bullshit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a buyer on SR for 8 months. I&#039;ve spent thousands of dollars here, with many transactions. I&#039;ve never auto finalized, and I&#039;ve never had or asked for a refund. <br /><br />Is this asshole going to win in resolution? If all he has to do is provide a tracking number then I&#039;m screwed? I saved the box he sent it in, which I don&#039;t see how you could fit 2 ounces of bud in it, maybe 2 ounces of compressed brick weed.&nbsp; And I took a few photos of the package just how I got it, and of it opened. But that doesn&#039;t really prove anything.<br />Anyone have any advice? Or a similar experience. I plan on fighting this til the end. They will have to take the funds from me, I will not FE. This is almost $300, not chump change for me.

				You could show the vendor the picture of the box pre-opened, or opened with the weed inside unopened, which according to you will prove that 2 oz wouldn&#039;t fit inside. Then explain that if nothing is done about him shorting you, you will do your best to make sure it doesn&#039;t happen to anyone else (which you should).<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why people are dishonest on here. This type of activity requires both parties to trust each other. How can that happen when you have customers lying about what they got, and vendors lying about what they sent? You&#039;d think people would just want things to run smoothly so that it&#039;s not ruined.

				I totally agree. I&#039;ve never had a problem, aside from a few shipping errors. I really don&#039;t think this vendor did it on purpose. I think he got overwhelmed with orders, and he thinks I&#039;m trying to pull some shit. But the part about carefully reviewing his info and determining that he in fact sent 2 ounces is just wrong. Because if he did have some kind of accurate records of what he sent then it would show that he only sent one.<br />&nbsp;A part of me thinks he has people working for him that are fucking him over. Idk, the whole thing just seems fishy. I would advise all to stay away until he gets his shit together. The vendor is Fast Forward.

				Fast Forward is fucked in the head. I&#039;m sure that the fact that I just said that will give him yet another excuse to not do what he promised, which is make everything right on everyone&#039;s orders. In my case, I ordered two different items to be shipped in a single Express shipment. After it didn&#039;t show for a while, he finally gave me a TN. Note: when he sent me the TN, he hadn&#039;t even checked the tracking results himself because (get this) he was too busy shipping out that day&#039;s orders. Are you fucking kidding me? After he had said he would do everything possible to make sure I got my package, he can&#039;t take the 25 seconds it would take to go the USPS website and type in the number? Now there&#039;s a vendor dedicated to customer satisfaction.<br /><br />Now, had he tracked the package, he would&#039;ve seen that for some reason, it was categorized &quot;Return to Sender&quot; at the very first sorting center it arrived at, and then sent back to the post office covering the zipcode (I believe) he used on the return adress. The tracking information has not changed for almost a month. In the meantime, despite all his wonderful promises to make things right cause we gotta trust each other, yeah , yeah, and all you have to do is put a message out there saying URGENT with the transaction ids and he&#039;ll fix it up right away, he hasn&#039;t done *anything*, not even read my messages. The last message I got from him said that he was going to somehow post &quot;PROOF&quot; that he properly addressed the package in a private msg restricted to myself and SR admin. He said &quot;I can see you feel that more is needed from my end so here is the last proof I have to give you. I will encrypt the paper copy with your address and the excite same tracking number in a private listing that only you and SR can see. Let me know and I will set aside the time in just a bit to do this. &quot;&nbsp; This was over two weeks ago and he has not done what he said he was going to do, nor has he responded to any of my messages during that time.<br /><br />However, I also know that Fast Forward is aware that he fucks up packages. A while back I had an order in with him for two items, and another order in for one of those two items from another vendor. The package from the other vendor first and because I&#039;d never ordered from him before and the time was more appropriate t the FF package. I emailed FF, saying that he had forgotten one of the items and he was jus like &quot;ha=ha&quot;, I thought I had mixed that up because the other guy had complained too. Well, a couple days later, my *Express* package from FF comes in with the correct contents, only the postmark showed that it had been shipped two days after he had marked it &quot;in transit&quot;.<br /><br />I think that Fast Forward&#039;s heart is generally in the right place, but when you start ignoring people to whom you owe $400 while implying that the only obstacle in getting the money back is aneed to remain patient and polite, then you&#039;re just on some weird power trip. He&#039;s the only vendor I know of whose standard is &quot;If I can show a DCN showing the package was shipped, then tough luck.&quot; Well, you can&#039;t get the destination zipcode of a USPS package with a DCN unless the package is delivered, so all he has to is send any empty box to a bad address and he&#039;s got his proof.<br /><br />I suspect what happened in my case is that when he went to collect the PROOF that he had sent to the correct address, he discovered that he had in fact fucked up and used a wrong address and hey, since this guy was stupid enough to FE and he&#039;s actually had the gall to express annoyance at the delay and confusion, why not do the easy thing and keep his money. After all, it&#039;s not like I set out to scam him. That makes it okay right?<br /><br />Fast Forward, if you&#039;re out there reading this, be a man of your word instead of a whimpering coward. Talk is cheap and so far, that&#039;s all I&#039;ve gotten from you. Why don&#039;t you stop by the PO that allegedly had the package on hand and see what they can tell you? I&#039;ve spoken to them twice on the phone.<br /><br />Do what&#039;s honorable, not what&#039;s merely convenient. And stop advertising on your profile page that you&#039;re resolving all problems with missing packages, when it&#039;s clear to me you are deliberately ignoring my case.<br /><br />-- Scratch<br />

				Damn that sucks that you FE&#039;d. I got some crazy messages from FF about how he was so plagued with arthritis that he could barely type the message he was sending me. Idk, weird. But anyway I sent the case to resolution, and he (or his assistant?) agreed to send me &quot;a hell of a variety&quot; if I promised to finalize once I received the package, and if I went to the forum to help clear up his name and all of the slandering. Slandering? You have a shit load of pissed off people because they&#039;re not getting what they paid for, and they&#039;re being ignored on top of that.<br />But u agreed to his terms, even though I wasn&#039;t sure what a &quot;hell of a variety pack&quot; would consist of, since my order was short an ounce of Sour OG, which let me just say the one ounce I did get was mid grade at best with 5-6 grams of dry ass shake and stems. So a few days went by, and I sent another message to see what the status was, and the next day I had a message from SR staff informing me that he agreed to my original resolution of 50% refund.&nbsp; So, in the end I ended up losing about $40 from fees and fluctuations I&#039;m guessing, and it left a bad mark on my refund rate, as it was my only refund in being a buyer for almost a year now.&nbsp; Overall a shitty experience and I&#039;ll definitely never do business with FF again.<br />I feel for you man, and I hope FF makes it right with you and resolves your issue. Leads on learned I suppose.
