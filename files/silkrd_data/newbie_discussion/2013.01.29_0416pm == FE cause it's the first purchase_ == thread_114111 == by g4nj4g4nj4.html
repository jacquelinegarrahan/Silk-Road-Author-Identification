				Okay I&#039;m just waiting for my bitcoins to arrive and about to place my first order&nbsp; :D<br /><br />The vendor I&#039;m looking at (DrugsAndCash) requires FE if you have 0 buying stats so far. Just not sure if this is legit? His feedback score is 100 % now but what&#039;s gonna stop them for selectively scamming new buyers. So I&#039;m feeling so well about it.<br />On the other hand the offers look really good and with only a small amount I could just risk a gamble :-\<br /><br />What do you guys think about this?

Perhaps find a different vendor for your first buy who doesn&#039;t require FE and then return to DrugsAndCash?<br /><br />Alternatively, buy a cheap digital good for a dollar or two to get some buyer stats.

				All the advice says to never FE.&nbsp; I think this is a solid rule for large purchases, but new members can be a bit more flexible.&nbsp; Being a new member, I placed two orders the other day, one of the vendors required FE for having less than 4 or 5 purchases.&nbsp; With hundreds of positive reviews and having been around for 6+ months, I figured the odds were pretty small that the vendor would want to risk a stellar reputation on a $100 transaction.&nbsp; Could I get screwed?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Am I concerned about it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; For small purchases by new members using a long-time vendor with top-notch reviews, I think FE is OK.&nbsp; Once I have 4 or 5 transactions, I don&#039;t expect to be asked to FE any more.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				FE = Finalize Early.&nbsp; It&#039;s where you release your funds to the vendor before you actually receive the product.&nbsp;

FE is acceptable when you are a newbie, it&#039;s the only way a vendor can protect himself against scammer buyers who will open a new clean account after they get a refund. But you have to be sure about the vendor and only buy small quantities! Of course after a few transactions he has no right to ask for FE, you have no reason to trust him more than he trusts you.<br /><br />

				I would avoid Finalising Early at all costs and recommend buying from a different vendor first, even if slightly more expensive. There are plenty out there who don&#039;t require it for newbs.<br />After all, what if you&#039;re not being scammed and it genuinely does get lost in transit? Finalising early will then put a burden on both you and the seller.<br />Find someone who doesn&#039;t require FE simply for peace of mind.

				all signs say DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY, but the truth is most of us have to finalize early from time to time. I have stellar stats, long time member, no auto finalize, well over any vendors &quot;must have x number of transactions&quot; and some vendors still make you FE. Ivory is a prime example, he has made me finalize early on every transaction we have done. My first buy on SR was from one of the top 3 vendors and they selectively scammed me cause I was a noob. They did reship, but in hindsight I know they tried to scam me, it only makes good business sense to try to rip off anyone you can, right? The vendor knows that a certain percentage of first time buyers regret sending off for contraband and when it does not show they think they have been compromised and they never visit SR again. Pure profit to the vendor. Sorry that it happens, but it does. If I ever vend I will not do ANY rip offs. My advice is shop around, lowest price doesn&#039;t mean squat if your item never arrives, go ahead and pay a bit more to insure quality and delivery. Good luck

				Thanks guys, think I&#039;m gonna go with a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE then. Don&#039;t wanna waste money and time.<br />I got ripped off by street dealers often enough. Hoping for the better on here&nbsp; 8)

				I only have 3 buys and I had to FE them all. I&#039;ve used mail-order drugs long before silk road, so I&#039;m used to paying first. I would suggest that you only FE for reputable domestic vendors who offer tracked shipping.

				There are a couple things you instantly know about a vendor who does not require FE:<br /><br />1. If they do not require FE then you can be sure that they already own the drugs they are selling you.<br />2. If they do not require FE then they aren&#039;t going to get paid until your package arrives. This means they will most likely get your package in the mail ASAP.<br /><br />Aside from this of course you get the calm that comes with knowing your money is safe in escrow.
