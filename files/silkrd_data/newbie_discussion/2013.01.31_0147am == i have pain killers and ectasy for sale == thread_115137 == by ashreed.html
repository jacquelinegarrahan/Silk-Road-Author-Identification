				I have to break it down to you man. First you are posting for drug sales outside of SR in an SR forum and you posted in a Newbie section, next the fact that you even gave out your phone number and email address is a huge concern. The fact that you have a yahoo email address posted instead of a TOR email address and that you gave out your phone number speaks you are an armature. Good luck with you endeavor, but I highly doubt you will get any business.

				Yo have enough people reported this to get it removed yet?<br /><br />Why are the mods slacking? Anyone who comes to this site and posts any kind of personal information even if it IS their own (which I am guessing it isn&#039;t) should have it removed asap.<br /><br />I know I would be pissed if a bunch of random people started harassing my number because my asshole friend put it on a forum full of people looking to teach him a lesson for listing his number.

				I bet this is one of 2 things. Either the guy is a some law enforcer (I doubt it they are a little smarter than that), or this guy/girl is a complete moron (I bet the later rather than previous). Now the road does need to get rid of the thread or just let the fool take ridicule from all of us.

I really think he needs to post a link to a gps so we can watch his/her every move. Then when we really need something we can find him/her if they decide to not answer their phone.
