				This might make me seem a bit stupid but hopefully the information will be useful to some of you. Sorry if I could have posted it somewhere more appropriate<br /><br />I ordered a small amount of amphetamines from a relatively low-risk country. After about 5 weeks of waiting I began to suspect that it had been lost or intercepted along the way. Due to what i had read, and common sense, I was expecting either; a letter on the subject from the AFP or Customs, nothing or possibly a knock on the door from the locals. Instead I got two cars worth of police taking my house apart over an amount of drugs that wouldn’t get me through a weekend. The man-hours would have cost 10-20 times the value of the drugs. This also took place around the time that Customs announced it lacked the resources to recover the bodies of around 55 asylum seekers who had drowned north of Australia, so it’s nice to know that priorities are in order and taxes are being well spent. Anyway... due to the amount of time that had passed, I had become a bit complacent and left a bong and some bud sitting around.<br /><br />I ended up admitting to ordering the stuff off the internet, as I wasn’t prepared to sign a false statement or lie in court. Facing court was a risk because of the bong found on my property. I received a formal caution that appears on my full police record, but not the two lesser ones. <br /><br />The cop that interviewed me pretended not to know about Silkroad. I gave a vague explanation of the site and of bitcoins. He was interested in methods of cashing out for vendors but I said I didn’t know any, which is true. He also asked how I had found out about the site. He didn’t ask the name of the vendor, which I would not have supplied anyway. I never received any advice of the seizure from Customs and the local police also refused to give me any documentation. I have not yet contacted the federal agencies to make a request for this.<br /><br />So my advice to other Australians would be to make sure your house is spotless and to consider ordering only within Australia. The price is massively inflated but it is more likely to get to you. It may also mean the difference between an importing and a possession charge. The greatest dangers for most recreational drug users, other than the law, are; associating with criminals and impure/inconsistent products. If you use Silkroad properly you can basically avoid these two things. Long live the dark web and all defenders of privacy.

				You really shouldn&#039;t have said anything without a lawyer. <br /><br />Unless they had physical proof (such as your computer with tor etc) they wouldn&#039;t really have a case.<br /><br />May I ask what the substance was? And was it classified as a personal amount by law?<br /><br />It interests me because it doesn&#039;t make sense for the police to waste such resources unless they had suspicions of something on a much larger scale. <br /><br />Either that or the AFP are really cracking down. Which would shock me while not really being surprised at the same time.<br /><br />Or you&#039;re trolling. Who knows.

				I assume the authorities had a warrant that would indicate the reasoning for search and seizure.<br /><br />Personally after 5 weeks and worry I would have cleaned house and awaited the Love Letter or Knock.<br />I doubt I would have given an interview without a lawyer present but in your case seems to have worked out ok with a simple &#039;caution&#039;.<br /><br />Sending to Australia/New Zealand is Roulette odds are not favorable.

				It would be pretty ineffective, time consuming trolling if it was. Yeah it was a personal amount, can PM you if you need to know what it was. Also I did get legal advice before I said anything. Nah they didn&#039;t take my computer or anything, but they could have charged me for the bong. In terms of the warrant, the seizure was evidence enough. I wasn&#039;t keen on signing a false statement because I am somewhat ethical and it can backfire. Just trying to give people an idea of what happened.

				you fucked up big op. <br /><br />you&nbsp; never ever talk to the cops. there is absolutely nothing for you to gain by doing so. don&#039;t take any notice of all that bullshit they tell you about this is your chance to get&nbsp; your side of the story across, it isn&#039;t, the court room is your place to put your side across. the only purpose of a police interview is for the police to secure more evidence against you via a confession. you cannot talk your way out of charges in an interview. they either have enough evidence to charge in which case no matter what you say will make no difference. or they don&#039;t have enough evidence to charge in which case they will be really needing that confession. trying to bullshit your way out will inevitably trip you up and then they get to call you a liar even before the court case has started.<br /><br />and don&#039;t think that actually being innocent is reason to talk either, in fact it is even more reason to stay silent. lets say for example somebody ordered drugs off the internet to your address. maybe a friend who is always round yours and you had no knowledge of this. so you go in the interview and tell them you really have no idea why drugs were sent to your house and that somebody else must have ordered them, but you&#039;re not sure who. you have now just given your whole defense to the police who will now spend the next months leading up to the trial looking for a way to disprove your defense. they will even make shit up if they have to. and then the prosecutor will get all this info, he knows exactly what you&#039;re going to say in your defense and will work his case in such a way to make you look as guilty as possible, coz that&#039;s his job. he&#039;ll know all the answers to the questions he asks you, and he will also know exactly which questions not to ask. court cases are won and lost solely on whether the prosecutor or defense puts their case over the best.<br /><br />why give them the heads up when you don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />i mean its too late for you now op, you got drugs on your record now. watch over the years how many times that is going to come back and bite you in the ass. ain&#039;t no fucking joke bruv.

				one day the op will get himself together, he&#039;ll get a nice decent job and will start to climb the ladder of success a little bit. one day his boss will call him in the office and say &#039;hey, we want you to go to LA with brad and help him sort out a new deal we&#039;re setting up there. go see mary in the office and she will sort out your tickets and stuff. the op will be like &#039;omg yo, this is fucking awesome, i&#039;m going to LA, all expenses paid and everything&#039;.<br /><br />he&#039;ll go and see mary and she&#039;ll say &#039;yeah just fill out this form for your visa and we&#039;ll sort the rest out for you&#039;. op will start filling out the form and when he gets to the criminal convictions part he will remember his little silk road related caution. &#039;shit&#039;, he&#039;ll think, &#039;what do i do now&#039;. he can either put in his conviction, in which case the boss will see it and say &#039;hey, you lied to us, you&#039;re fired&#039;. or he can leave it blank and hope nobody notices. then he&#039;ll get to LAX, prolly travelling with some work colleagues, they will get off and go to immigration where they will say to him &#039;fuck off, you got a drug conviction, you ain&#039;t coming into our country, lol&#039;. word will soon get back to his boss who will then say &#039;hey, you lied to us, you&#039;re fired&#039;.

Burden of getting evidence is on them. <br />Nothing has been substantiated, what can they charge you with? they havent proven anything<br />Good lawyer will argue there is no case here.<br /><br />There can be hundreds of other reasons why theirs drugs in your mail box<br />but because you opened your mouth, theres only one reason <br /><br />Case 2)<br />Theres drugs in the mailbox<br />and the police are here<br />you tell the cops everything<br />You go to jail / get charged<br /><br />I would take case 1) any day.

				I know it&#039;s been said, but...don&#039;t say ANYTHING to the cops. <br />That means not admitting anything, as well as not denying anything either. It doesn&#039;t matter what they find in your house/car/mailbox. They will try to trick you into saying something, and they will try to intimidate and threaten you as well. Why make their job easier?<br />It is hard to keep your cool but it is so worth it in the long run.<br />I have been busted interrogated by police regarding drugs but somehow managed to keep my mouth shut, it was the only thing that saved me. Not trying to boast or be a tough cunt, just hoping this might benefit someone.

				The explanation given by the OP is a little vague.....<br /><br />The way I read it, the Police might not have been there for drugs. Maybe they suspect the OP of some other crime and the topic of drugs only came about when they found the bong. Sounds like the coppers didn&#039;t know anything much about SR by the questions they asked?

				1) I can&#039;t understand how police (state, AFP?) can get a warrant to search your house based on the fact that they suspect you have ordered a small amount of illicit drugs under a false name to your house.&nbsp; Especially without any supporting evidence.<br /><br />If they have confiscated the drugs before you became in possession of them you did not receive them,&nbsp; 99.9% of legal case GONE.&nbsp; Why do you think they do controlled deliveries/substance swaps?&nbsp; What good is searching the house to find other drugs that have no bearing on the crime they are trying to prosecute in the first place? Finding a bong and some bud does not legally imply that you are an importer of amphetamine...<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t give them their whole case on a platter.....<br /><br />If this was a valid example, think of how many houses would have been raided by now after 2 1/2 years of SR orders being confiscated.&nbsp; I just find this example very unlikely, or at least complete madness if it is true.

				This doesn&#039;t sound right. <br /><br />Do you represent a consortium of Australian Vendors trying to get people to order their ridiculously inflated prices instead of o/s? <br /><br />(That doesn&#039;t go for all but MOST vendors)

Facing court was a risk because of the bong found on my property.

Have you ever heard the phrase : &quot;Deny,deny,deny!&quot;<br />You could have admitted the bong was yours and the weed. The meth could have been anybodys . Instead&nbsp; of saying something like : I didnt order shit! You could also say: &quot;You cant get drugs in the mail,thats silly!&quot;<br /><br />INstead you fucked yourself. You probably wouldnt have even had to pay the lawyer if they booked you on the meth charges. You most likely would have been found Not Guilty. Except for the bong and weed.

				I don&#039;t know why they went to so much trouble as I haven&#039;t read about any searches over small amounts. Maybe people aren&#039;t writing about it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spoken about the legal advice I received and wont go into it again. I will just say that a conviction for weed/having your name published etc is undesirable in some people&#039;s circumstances. Fair enough if you want to say &#039;don&#039;t do drugs if you don&#039;t want to go to court&#039; but that doesn&#039;t contribute much to the discussion. I don&#039;t necessarily recommend anyone do the same thing in the same situation, that&#039;s not really the point of the post. The info is there for anyone who is interested enough to read it properly. <br /><br />My other advice to people starting on here would be that a lot of the posters on this forum, like any forum, don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about. Be aware of the laws in your state. That will be more useful to you than slogans or experiences relating to the American legal system.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Fire your lawyer.&nbsp; Name and shame them!<br /><br />There is only one answer to: &quot;Should I speak to police?&quot; No sane lawyer would advise you to speak to the police in a situation like this. Especially if they are not with you at the time. <br /><br />This is law 101. <br /><br />Think about it, cough up to an importation charge to hopefully not be charged for the most minor possession rap you can get? <br /><br />You should be questioning how they were able to get a warrant, presuming they had one, with no evidence to justify a search...<br /><br />This has to be BS.<br /><br /><br />(Australian stats show that approx 4-7% of people approached or charged by police refuse to say anything so if you are real, you are in &quot;great&quot; company&quot; )

				I reckon if you had a genuine interest in this you would be less interested in me and more interested in what the cops did. I found a few similar stories on here today http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15687.msg154098#msg154098 <br /><br />Anyway there&#039;s not much more I can say about it. Expected some abuse but decided the story would be useful to some of you.
