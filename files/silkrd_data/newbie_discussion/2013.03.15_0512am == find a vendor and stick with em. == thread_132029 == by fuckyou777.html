				ive been on the road about 6-7months. ive seen quite a bit.( maybe not as much as some) ive seen ALOT of new sellers...and this is to be expected wut with the gain in popularity this last year. back to my point....FIND A DEALER AND STICK WITHEM! this comes from a place of total paranoia BUT lets be serious, the cops? yeah they want us. they want us ALL. and setting up fake accounts to gather address for there database seems like a sure posibility. ihave gotten sketched out by 2 &quot;newer&quot; sellers and have permanently learned my lesson..if it sounds to good to be true...it probally is. find a dude.....even if it cost more money( i know how hard this is) and just stick with him if ur satisfyed with his product. hopping around from vendor to vendor trying to find the &quot;holy grail&quot; is really just gonna end with your addy being post marked on LT. Douchebags library of watched addresses....paranoia out.

				Would that I could stick with the same vendors, but people&#039;s stock seems to come and go so quickly these days too... hard to have a favorite vendor when they&#039;re so popular their stuff flies off the shelves, yeh?

				This is stellar advice - as long as the seller has everything you want.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit tougher for those that want top quality for multiple vices...

				It&#039;s gonna take a while though to find that one vendor you stick with for good, there&#039;s too much of a selection here!

				I have used quite a few vendors over time, and stick with about 3-4. It seems all the newer vendors have this fucking attitude that I just cant stand. They threaten to black list you for giving less than perfect feedback for SHITTY service that is worse than Taco Bell at 3am on a Monday. Another word to the wise, I can&#039;t believe how many vendors are getting away with requiring FE for orders. This should almost NEVER be used, so dont be a sap and do it, regardless of the feedbacck!! I cant tell you how much of the feedback is FAKE on 70% of the vendor profiles...<br /><br />Escrow is there to protect both buyers and sellers from getting fucked, if a vendor is so fucked up that they cant wait 2-3 days to get thier coin, then they should NOT be in biz, or are most likely a SCAMMER! Stay away! Any good vendor, (and there are quite a few long time ones out there that have just about everything you may need), that will follow the rules, go above and beyond.&nbsp; Any good vendor, if you order by noon, should have it shipped that DAY, with delivery withing 2 days, period. None of this, I&#039;ll get to it when I feel like it BS, and dont bother me for DCN/delivery info. FUCK THEM! DCN should be provided with every order its paid for. Forget all the BS&nbsp; that has spread like week old bullshit, it is NOT a security risk. The sellers have more of chance of getting in a acccident on the way to the PO statistically, than finding out some irrelavant info about who shipped what by tracking a DCN. There are MILLIONS that go out a day, the few that g out from SR vendors are virtually non existant. <br /><br />Stand up, grab your sack, and make SR what it used to be. The admins/siteOPs all need to work together to set the bad eggs straight. This transparent authority, sadly does NOT work with the sheer volume of the site these days. PLEASE HELP AND STAY TRUE TO SR!!!<br /><br />Peace out-

				I have dealt with quite a few vendors over the past year, close to 20 different ones and have been lucky in that all of them were legit.&nbsp; The problem I have is that many do not keep in stock of the things I look for so it is hard to always stick with the same one.&nbsp; It is very important to do research, check the forums for vendor reviews and trust your gut if something seems sketchy.&nbsp; The fake feedback does seem to be a rising concern.&nbsp; Also, not finalizing early is probably the best way to protect yourself, its better to refuse a deal that seems really good than to risk being ripped off by some punk bitch scammer.
