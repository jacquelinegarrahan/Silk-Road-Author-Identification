				i want to give credit to a couple of excellent vendors on SR. Chaletla and Hammertime. i have dealt with both of them for meth quite a few times and have always been happy. both have good product and great pricing. both have great customer service with fast turn arounds on orders, reliable shipping and great communication. i have been using Chaletla a bit more lately, because they have the best price for the item i want. and free priority shipping is nice too! i would recommend either one but if i had to choose, the scales are tipped to Chaletla at the moment, mainly for the pricing, product and good experiences with speedy shipping. thanks to both vendors. hope they stay on the road for a long time!

				Bumping this thread for new folks because it&#039;s full of truth.<br /><br />Chaletla is the real deal from placing your order to finalizing the deal. Expect to have no problems.

				Just placed a small .5 test order with this vendor, I&#039;ll add my .02 when I receive.<br /><br />I do know his pricing is top notch, pricing like you&#039;d see on the street IF you knew somebody. Makes you wonder why they have to charge 500% for cola on SR?

				Chaletla is NOT standing behind the shit he has been selling for the last month or 2.&nbsp; It used to be decent and now he is pushing crap and won&#039;t make it right.&nbsp; He is not getting orders out and sitting on people&#039;s coins.&nbsp; Don&#039;t waste your time on this fuckup.&nbsp; AmericaOnDrugs and DankHerbalIncense have way better shit for almost the same price.&nbsp; Hammertime has great stuff as always for a little more, but professional as shit.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy into the hype of the reviews of Chaletla - people give him 5/5 because they were afraid of being cut off because nobody could touch his prices - until now.&nbsp; He got people hooked on low prices and decent shit and now sells shit shit and low prices.&nbsp; Try the other vendors and get good shit at low prices.&nbsp; This dumbfuck has used the same post office to send hundreds of orders.&nbsp; His time is up.

				I cant say any thing good about&nbsp; Chaletla. I tried to&nbsp; order from him, but made a mistake with PGP, I messaged him a few times with the correct PGP but he didn&#039;t reply nor processes my order. now my coin is in limbo for 4 days till I can cancel. Hamertime was good but Im going try AOD.

				He never processed or sent my order. when that happens my coin sits for 4 day until I can cancel. Sr said the vendor has up to 4 days to send my order and after 4 days if they dont send I can cancel the order and get a refund. But during the whole time my coin is stuck.

				Before I get into this, a friend of mine ordered significantly often from this vendor so that is THE ONLY reason I gave him a try (the 100 rating helped too). <br /><br />My struggle with Mr. Chaletla (copied from my feedback to him of 1/5 and with some explanatory additions with brackets):<br /><br />&quot;The whole story with my order:<br />Order marked in transit day after. I wait one week checking the mail, everyday after the 3rd day, and nothing. I start sending messages to track it. I get a reply that it&#039;s going to be sent tomorrow (that&#039;s 9 days after marked in transit! [10 days after the order is placed]). I gave the benefit of the doubt. Three days later I receive a bag of stuff that looks like ketamine tiny shards. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER FINALIZE UPON RECEIPT. I smoked it and I guess if you&#039;re an idiot from a state like mine that doesn&#039;t know too much about tina maybe someone might&#039;ve thought &quot;that&#039;s what crystal must be like.&quot; So I reply that I better get the real stuff and I want it express for the utterly obnoxious wait time. [he replies he&#039;ll send me ten grams for the fuckup]. Two days later I receive a package of 60% big ass beautiful shards. Awesome product [turns out I was even fooled by the shards because the friend who recommended it smoked some and said it&#039;s not what he was sent two months ago]. The other 40% was that same crap from first time. But like a dummy I saw those gigantic beautiful shards and hit the finalize button. As a seller on the streets I figured I have a lot of people who just sniff so I&#039;ll give them that. Two of those people felt sick for two days. Personally after I accidentally mixed some with the big shards to smoke-test it, later in the day my hands, mouth, forehead, and forearms became pockmarked. I have no idea why this seller chose to fuck with me specifically given his amazing reviews and honestly a 5/5 level product [my friend says it&#039;s 2/5 compared to his old stuff]. However I seen forum postings about people with less than 5 transactions getting this fake shit. So if you have less than five be REAL WEARY of this guys shit. So, Chaletla, I hope all the people with low stats that buy from you and never tried tina or just not too good with understanding what REAL meth is wake the fuck up and don&#039;t fall for your &quot;meth.&quot; If you want me to make this a 5/5 review, (and your product was 5/5) then send real shit and not in a ratio of real to fake. JUST REAL&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not upset about losing money at all. I am upset about losing potential money I could make selling this shit in an area that has a massive demand but the lowest supply imaginable. But if this is being done to &quot;newbies&quot; then that&#039;s a dickhead move like no other because these people are already nervous about how SR works and when I was using my 1st account (which I sold to a close friend because he needed an acct. with high stats to order bulk from another vendor), those first buys to me were exactly like Christmas morning. Had I been ripped off in my first few buys I would never have confidence in SR and would have missed all of these amazing opportunities in money-making, self-discovery through psychedelics I have no access to where I live&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Vendor got the message that I was one upset customer. He offered to resend the package, +weight, and express. The package arrived on time and was perhaps the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. GIGANTIC shards and beyond superb quality. My only advice to newbies or buyers with low stats is to message him before buying it and making sure that everything will be on point. Let him know you have heard about it happening to others and will not stand for it if it happens to you. <br /><br />Vendor told me that his packaging person was fired solely because of how I was treated as a customer. Chaletla takes customer satisfaction very seriously and I admire the tremendous effort he undertook to make my transaction satisfactory to me.
