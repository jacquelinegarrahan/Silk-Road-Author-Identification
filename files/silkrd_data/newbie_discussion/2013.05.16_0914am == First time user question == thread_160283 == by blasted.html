				You should be more patient..<br /><br />&nbsp;A) Looked through the newb forums for an answer to this, found my newb FAQ thread, asked there, got and answer..<br />&nbsp;B) It takes a minimum of 6 confirmations on the blockchain.info to be available in your SR account, with each confirmation taking at least 10 min... some times much more, but its uncommon.

				I don&#039; know what Cavirtex is but when I deposit my money it normally takes about 2 hours to get to my wallet then I send them to my SR wallet which takes about another 2 hours. Idk if that helps you at all but I hope it does.

				Please see the SR Wiki here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_isn.27t_my_deposit_showing_up_in_my_account.3F<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why isn&#039;t my deposit showing up in my account?<br /><br />It can take up to 6 hours for a deposit to be confirmed on the blockchain, processed, and credited to your Silk Road account. If your deposit still hasn&#039;t shown up, first check that it is showing up on the blockchain by searching for your deposit address on a site like blockchain.info. If your transfer doesn&#039;t appear here, then it was never sent and you need to find out why from the person or organization who initiated the transfer. If the transfer does appear, then there could be a problem on our end and you should contact us. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Libertas

I buy them via my bank in Europe and they get deposited to my wallet in blockchain and now I send the straight to SR.<br />See it si not illegal to posses bitcoins nor is ti illegal to send them to SR and.... SR tumbles them upon arrival which also delays them to arrive at your account - but in a sense it should be OK if<br />your level of paranoia is same as mine.<br />If I were a vendor with a huge number of transactions I would be much more careful - I doubt LE will spend too much effort or energy to crack down on me for buying a few grams of coke - more importantly keep your address PGPed and change the bitcoin address every time in SR
