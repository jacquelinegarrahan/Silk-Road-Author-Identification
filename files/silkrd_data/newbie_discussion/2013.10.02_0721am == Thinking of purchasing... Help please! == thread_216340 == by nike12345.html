				I hope everyone is well. I have always been fascinated by this website and I thought enough is enough, I want to access it. Once I did my mind was blown. <br /><br />I might interested in buying cocaine and maybe some ecstasy pills down the track. Can you please tell me the most secure way of purchasing through this website<br /><br />I want to find out;<br /><br />Where I should get the package posted to (a fake ID with p.o box?) (my home address?)<br />Where I should buy from (the cocaine that I am interested in is from the Netherlands and would mean posting it a long distance) (should I only buy local?)<br />I&#039;d want to buy 3.5g of cocaine - is this too much if I want to be discreet as possible?<br /><br />Any further advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />I am a complete noob, but I want to be educated about SR please!<br /><br />:)<br />

(I&#039;m guessing US?) Although international may have cheaper product/higher quality you have to take into account the&nbsp; &nbsp; extra risk of the package having to go through customs.&nbsp; The vendors stealth comes into play much more when going through customs.&nbsp; Make sure and read vendor profiles to see their policies on int&#039;l shipping and they usually address what will happen if package goes MIA.&nbsp; Also, you should read vendor profile even for domestic orders to know their policies.&nbsp; This also goes to say that I am seriously considering looking into Canadian bud vendors.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;d want to buy 3.5g of cocaine - is this too much if I want to be discreet as possible?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I can&#039;t speak to this size,drug or vendor specifically but 3.5g of powder is a bit harder to hide than some RC,LSD,Benzo Blotter.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;d bet a dollar that packages from the Netherlands receives extra scrutiny (nothing to back this up, just gut feeling)<br /><br />As someone who was recently &quot;noobish&quot;, after a few transactions you get the hang of it.&nbsp; Just remember to not do anything stupid and you are responsible for your actions.&nbsp; If you let a vendor convince you to FE early(release funds to seller before you receive package) you will have no hope of getting refund/reship unless vendor goes out of the way(RARE).&nbsp; Also, learn PGP many vendors require it, ALL of the good ones I&#039;ve dealt with require it.<br /><br />Ratings are not always the be all, end all, you&#039;ll have lots of fun weighing out risk/reward between vendors.&nbsp; Newer vendors who may not have that many transactions alot of times will go out of their way to make you super happy.&nbsp; They want that 5/5 rating but due to being new may slack on labeling and stealth in general.&nbsp; Where as a vendor who&#039;s been around for a year will, usually, be flooded with messages and generally won&#039;t respond to questions and will be more expensive.<br /><br />When traveling the road, always remember to take care of your shoes.

				Like the doctor mentioned, eliminate as many potentials for screwing up as possible. Stick with domestic and you can&#039;t get caught in customs. Shipping to a visibly empty house has an increased potential for getting caught. Small amounts means the feds can&#039;t be bothered with you much. <br /><br />If you do use a PO box monitor it closely. They run drug and bomb dogs through the post offices every now and then. The longer your care package sits in one the more likely you are to have bad luck.<br /><br />On the 1 in a zillion chance the cops find drugs in a package sent to you just remember: you know nothing about it.

I&#039;m on my first purchase and am trying to research things as much as possible. I&#039;m having the debate about the PO box because I have to goto a more public location to pickup the goods (there are cameras). they do dog sniffing for drugs like you said. If it was my home address It seems more private and unlikely to be caught. Although I&#039;m giving out my home address to the vendor. <br /><br />I plan on ordering 7 grams to start. What do you all suggest from your experience with ordering small amounts to a home address? I live in the USA.<br /><br />thanks

				If you&#039;re dealing with a vendor that&#039;s active and 6+ months with nearly perfect feedback receiving at your home should be no issue.<br /><br />A PO Box is ideal though as you can rest easy that no matter what where you sleep is not compromised. And if you get a big enough<br />one, depending on the location you can enter at night with little to no traffic to retrieve your pack!<br /><br />Ordering from the Netherlands is a bad idea in general, imo. There may be some vendors that are more than capable there but the<br />country is a horrible place to receive packages from as it is assumed by most people to be something illegal.<br /><br />If you want your packs quick just order from your home country as dealing with customs increases the risk of seizure. Yes the prices<br />are higher but its the fastest/safest option always.<br /><br />
