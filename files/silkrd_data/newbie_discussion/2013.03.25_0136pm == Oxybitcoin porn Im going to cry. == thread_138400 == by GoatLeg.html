				I keep comming to Silk Road and theres all these drugs to buy but I just cant access it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cant buy bitcoins and feel really thick.&nbsp; Ive googled it and Ive watched videos on Youtube about it, Ive registered with websites but it just doesnt click with me.&nbsp; I also get the feeling its bad etiquette to ask for different payment options.&nbsp; I wish we could use UKash I really do.&nbsp; Theres minning and theres hash numbers and theres wiring this to here and sending that over there, I have even set aside whole afternoonS trying to work it out and Im obviously just a bit slow when it comes to it.&nbsp; Ive even messaged sellers on here asking them to tell me how to do the bitcoin thing.<br /><br />Im in UK, whenever I watch a youtube video on how to send bitcoins its always telling me how to send it via Walmart or Scmlogreens or whatever the shops are called over there and then I go to the website and even the options that WOULDNT work for me have gone.<br /><br />Im so frustrated this like drug porn............. Look, imagine, fantasize, but no touchy touch.<br /><br /><br />Im after Oxycontin 40mg or 80mg.......... small orders to begin with from a reputable vendor.&nbsp; Heroin was my drug of choice but UK heroin it terrbile so I have to find another way.&nbsp; If any reputuable UK vendor has Oxycontin (Old Forumal) and wants to either use Ukash or tell me how to use bitcoins, Ill buy a small order first time.<br /><br /><br />Does anyone from the UK know an easy way to get Bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So I can go in (wherever) and say there is your money please can I get the friggin bitcoins now please.

				Go to blockchain.info and make yourself a wallet.&nbsp; Hit the pay with cash to start the bitcoin process.&nbsp; Take your cash money to your choice of options and when you have your bitcoins in you wallet transfer them to your SR account....<br /><br />Is there a Wells Fargo or Chase Bank anywhere close to you?&nbsp; <br /><br />OR...... OR&nbsp; &nbsp;you could just get some bitcoins from a vendor here on SR like Sugar Mama.... easy peasy.... Buy a Reload-it card and put some cash on it.... pm Sugar Mama and/or read her profile... It explains everything there.....<br /><br />Good luck on your search....

				Mantidman<br /><br />Thanks very much for the reply..................<br /><br />I will go with buying bitcoins from vendors on here. I know its more money but I think its worth it for me,&nbsp; Its only 10-15% or so.&nbsp; I look forward to being able to use this site now <br /><br />So yeah...... thanks again<br /><br />GoatLeg.

				If you want bitcoins quick then goto Blockchain and use the Barclays Pingit app from your phone.<br /><br />You&#039;ll need to set up a wallet first and keep a record as you go along of your passwords and account details. Print these details off and keep them somewhere safe as bitcoins are next to impossible to recover once you&#039;ve lost access to your account. If you&#039;re making a one off purchase then try to purchase only the bitcoins you require as it is harder to convert them back to cash.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t be tempted by offers to send you free bitcoins for completing surveys, watching videos or from a bitcoin faucet. The value of the bitcoins gained will be less then the fee for processing them and will leave you out of pocket when they transfer over to your Blockchain wallet. <br /><br />Before attempting to make your first purchase though make sure you&#039;ve learnt how to use PGP first as you&#039;ll usually be asked to encrypt your address before you send it to the vendor.<br />
