				Did you grind up the bud or just put it straight into the needle?<br />If not, he probably died because there was shitloads of air in the needle.<br />It&#039;s impossible to die directly from weed, no matter how you take it. Whether snorting, eating,&nbsp; injecting etc.<br /><br />In the future, I advise all to grind the cannabis and distill it in some hydrofloric acid if injecting.<br /><br />I&#039;m generally against injecting cannabis, as this increases the addiction potential ten fold. I&#039;m favorable of the suppository method, there&#039;s no thing in this world quite as pleasurable as bending over, lubing up a nice bud then inserting it up your anus. The high you achieve is far greater than if you snorted it or other method, as the process of inserting a foreign object up your anus increases your blood-pressure, thus the speed and depth of the high. However, you quickly become used to the high, so ensure you mix up your form of consumption. An old friend of mine who had no mouth, no nose and no veins/arteries had no choice but to have his hit inserting in his anus, he soon got used to it and resulted to consuming in public to increase the blood pressure. He died last year after using a shotgun loaded with rounds using cannabis buds instead of lead, on his final hit he mixed up the ammo and resulted in shooting his bodily organs straight out of his non-existent mouth. His family believed he commited suicide, it would kill them to know it was accidental while trying to hit up some weed.

				Never heard of anyone trying to inject weed, sounds a bit rediculous to me. Injecting anything ruins the fun of getting high, it just complicates everything too. To each his own I guess.<br />

				Hmmmm... interesting dillema. Considering the suspected volume of THC necessary to overdose is roughly 40,000 times the THC needed to get a strong stone going....<br /><br />I have concluded that your friend died using some killer pot. Pass the needle!&nbsp; ;)
