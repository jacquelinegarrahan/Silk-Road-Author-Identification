				I have a cousin that has autism, and I am close with her. I feel kinda bad her condition, but I want to help. I have heard that marijuana helps with some medical ailments, but I don&#039;t know the extent. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

				Dont mean to sound the bore man but my advice would be to check with an actual doctor. I know someone who suffered with Autism and honestly never smoked weed with them as didn&#039;t know side effects it could have on them etc. <br /><br />I&#039;d check with a doctor first see what they advise about Marijuana, if that fails perhaps ask directly on Autism sites.<br /><br />Hope all works out.

				I have researched, and it seems like it is mixed, but mostly positive. Were my cousin is they have legal medicinal pot, but I am not sure about medical liability for asking a doctor. I believe that under Clinton at least, that a doctor could be liable for suggesting that. I don&#039;t know if this still applies.

I am based in the UK so completely different laws/medical requirements etc. The only thing I would say is you mentioned earlier that where your cousins based they have legal medicinal marijuana? I would of thought if it&#039;s going to help your cousin the doctor would have prescribed it and if not I&#039;m sure if your cousin mentioned to the doctor she had seen something online about marijuana being helpful I&#039;m sure he would advice her.

				But it is not legally federally, thus the doctor in question could get in deep shit for advising something illegal on the federal level. I imagine she could get a prescription from another doctor though.

All I can say is go on specialist autism forums and ask around there I am sure people who have been in the same boat as you will be able to help. Sorry couldn&#039;t be of more help and hope everything gets sorted, keep me posted.

				I have used cannabis to treat my mental disorders for years.<br /><br />Autism isn&#039;t one of them. It may make her more sociable but you definitely shouldn&#039;t have her rely on cannabis for social situations. It will only become a crutch later in life.

				Autism and cannabis probably wont work out the way you would hope but cannabis for depression and/or certain non-psychosis related disorders could be beneficial from what I&#039;ve read!
