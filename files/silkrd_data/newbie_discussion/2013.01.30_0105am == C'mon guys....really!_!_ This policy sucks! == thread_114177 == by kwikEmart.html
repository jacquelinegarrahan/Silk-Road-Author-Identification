				Spend a few posts here in the newbie section starting a &#039;kwikEmart Newbie Review Thread&#039;.<br /><br />Add a link to your vendor page in your signature. Then every helpful post you make in the newbie section will be a sort of advertisement to potential customers.

You spamming the sub-forum is one way for you to have your account banned, not to mention the extra work you&#039;re creating for the forum&#039;s Mod&#039;s. How about helping some newbie&#039;s out with some posts on what to do and what to avoid doing? Start up some threads on how your customers should order from you and what you expect from them. Doing these little things will increase your post count whilst helping others out instead of just spitting the dummy and having a whinge! ??? ???
