				I get this on certain stimulants. Caffeine being one of them. I have had this on MDMA aswell. Mildly usettling.<br /><br />Considerations<br /><br />Yawning is a normal response to fatigue and drowsiness, but excessive yawning can be caused by a vasovagal reaction. This reaction is caused by the action of a nerve, called the vagus nerve, on the blood vessels. It may indicate a heart problem.<br /><br />Normal yawning may happen when someone else yawns.<br />Causes<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Drowsiness or weariness<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Vasovagal reaction<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heart attack<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aortic dissection

				Yes I have experienced this. <br /><br />Proper MDMA is not a stimulant in the traditional sense. It also seems to affect different people in different ways, I have found smaller women in particular are afflicted by this yawning/drowsy response.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found a good solution is to to bang an amphetamine of some description at the start of the night, then drop the MDMA about an hour later, roll with that for several hours, then as you are coming down, a snatch more amphetamine to keep the party going.

				It happens quite a lot to me, only on the come up though. The MDMA will start kicking in and I&#039;ll be yawning non stop, I&#039;ve actually felt tired enough to lay down. It only lasts a few minutes, as it quickly smooths over into a warm roll, which I get up after feeling too damn good.

				Yes lots of Yawning with MDMA. MDMA is really quite sedating for me, it is nice and has its place, but MDA is my fav. In-fact MDA is kind of like MDMA with a bit of Dexedrine but without the nasty after effects. <br /><br />As an aside anyone know of a source for MDA since ILF (I think that was their name) just went off-line?

				Speedier/more energetic, some people don&#039;t care for that, like you may get chattering teeth, not necessarily clenching though. But gives the love and empathy of its sister MDMA. Personally I have found that I have more energy the next day after 150 mg MDA then a like amount of MDMA. Just a note on the chemistry, MDA is the Amphetamine (3,4-MethylenedioxyAmphetamine) versus MDMA (3,4-MethylenedioxyMethamphetamine) making it the Methamphetamine version. The difference makes the ride smoother and mellower with MDMA, but at least in my opinion almost to mellow, I like a bit of energy! <br /><br />Mushmold

				You guys have to look at it like this.. First off, MDMA is not a stimulant, maybe in a sense that it stimulates your senses, but its not an upper.<br /><br />&nbsp;Think about this, Heroin..It floods your brain with dopamine, The Molly, is the exact same thing, only totally opposite, if any one can make sense of that. When i hit people off with raw shit, rather than stepping it with anything, i have actually got call backs from people, exclaiming that i sold them dope. LOL To which i say, this my naive friends, is pure MDMA. LOL<br /><br />Ive yet to meet any one that deals IRL that has or passes out pure or next to pure MDMA, always steppd with amphetamines, either pink or white, or caffeine powder, or meth, or K , or 2c-b.. all of which are great shit to cut your molly with. But undoubtedly produces a slue of different effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT; The caps or pressd pills, that make you feel like you can dance for days, and swollowing even a sip of water is like trying to swallow razor blades, likely cut with meth.<br /><br />&nbsp;The ones that make you feel very talkative and sweaty and gives you slight jitters, ie fast hearbeat, likely caffeine, or maybe even coke.<br /><br />The ones that give you silly trails and fairly intense visuals, likely cut with 2c-b.<br /><br />The ones that make you feel like your floating, or very outer body/ third person view, likely cut with K.<br /><br />&nbsp;Shit in some cases people use all sorts of other chems, like 4 aco or the other psilibin type analogs. <br /><br />Just some reference points.
