				I have noticed that there is no listing for kilos or even half kilos of cocaine. Y is that is it more dangerous to sell large amounts on SR does it make you more of a target? I am thinking about posting kilos of cocaine on SR at a very good price for domestic sales should I rethink doing so?

And therefor I see at the beginning less chances to be sucessfull. Until he may have good stats, vednor for a long period, and last but not least the price. As in general its here more expensive than you can score in RL. So I am not questioned people importing or dealing with that amount of coke.<br />But maybe I am just wrong, and 1kg of coke is something to &quot;just give it a shot&quot;. Lets see maybe works out maybe not, so what ;-)
