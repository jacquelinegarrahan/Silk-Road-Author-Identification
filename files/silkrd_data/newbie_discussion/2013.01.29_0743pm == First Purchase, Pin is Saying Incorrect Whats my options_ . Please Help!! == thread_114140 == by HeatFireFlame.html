				Hi all and thanks for your help in advance. <br />OK so i was really looking forward to making ym first order, I was convinced that was me that had the hang of SR now, iv spent the last few weeks lurking and learning Now ive got it all and this happened. <br /><br />I was making my order&nbsp; i encrypted my message with pgp then put my pin in. it came up incorrect pin 5 attempts left. I tried 1 other possibility that it could be, and that was wrong too, So i started to panic a little and did some research on the forums and found that some more experienced buyers were having the same problems, albeit a while ago. <br /><br />So i still have 3 attempts left on my account at this point, I thought of just making a new account seeing as im a new member anyway i wouldn&#039;t be loosing any feedback or rep. but you need your pin to transfer funds to another user,So that was out the window. <br /><br />I tried resetting it, It logged me out, when i logged back in i tried re-ordering 1 more time and it came up incorrect pin again, I still have the 2 tries and i dont wanna fuck this up. Iv got 10 BTC in my act and it&#039;s my first purchase. Maybe i should have gone a bit smaller but i really had a grasp on how it all worked and i was happy to have found a reputable person willing to sell me them at a fairly decent rate and they had a good reputation so i took advantage of the moment and bought the 10, so it is a fairly decent amount of money to me, Not life changing or anything but i wont be smoking as much as i would like to for the next few weeks if i lose this cash. I was really cautious and safe doing everything right from scratch and value my anonymity highly. Is there any way of Getting this sorted ?? I mean if it&#039;s saying my pins wrong, and there seems to be no way to spend the money or transfer it without my pin,&nbsp; Am i screwed? I still have 2 tries left on the pin.What should i do?<br /><br />any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys. :-\<br />

				Here from the wiki:<br /><br />After 5 failed attempts to enter your PIN an automatic message will be delivered to you and the Support staff. Reply to that after 3 days to get a new PIN.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ%27s

				Message SR support on the bottom of the SR page page that says &quot;contact us&quot; and let them know you forgot your pin and you would want to reset it. Happens to the best of us, you will have to wait a couple of days before they let you reset your pin.
