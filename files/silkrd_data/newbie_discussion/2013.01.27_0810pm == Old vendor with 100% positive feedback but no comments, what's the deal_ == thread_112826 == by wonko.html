				A newbie question...<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at musent: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/db95fc1aff<br /><br />He has &quot;100% positive feedback from 206 transactions&quot; but no feedback comments. He &#039;has been a member for 1 year&#039;, is the feedback comment system new? Or do the comments expire? Or something else?

				Thanks, I came to the same conclusion, that feedback is from me :) There are 3 others on there now too...<br /><br />If everything goes to plan I&#039;ll be trying them later today.

				I&#039;ve also been looking at musent and wondering the same things. Many thanks for the info! It seems to me that the UK could really use a decent, reliable seller of psilocybin.<br /><br />If you guys happen to try these capsules, would you be so kind as to report back and share your experiences?

				It makes sense that the info is purged considering how many sales these guys do.

				Hmmmm purging all of the feedback seems like a mistake. I get if there&#039;s thousands and thousands of transactions they want to limit the SQL database size but purging absolutely all feedback isn&#039;t the best idea. Why not leave the last 20 feedback entries and purge the rest?

				Tried them last night. Wow!<br /><br />A brief report:<br /><br />Packaging was very discrete and fast, up to the high standards I have come to expect from SR vendors. Musent kindly packed in an extra .5g and I decided I would take the entire 4g.<br /><br />I took 2g to start with and then the remaining 2g over the following 20 minutes so as to not challenge my digestion too much. Over the first hour had the typical shroom coming up effects, then in the next 30 minutes everything exploded in unimaginable beauty. I found myself lying down saying &#039;wow&#039; over and over and thinking &#039;this and every thing is incredible&#039;. Some of the most intense mushroom visuals I have ever experienced. By the time I checked my trip timer again 5 hours had gone by.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking mushrooms on and off for a decade or so but not so much the last couple of years, I&#039;d forgotten what a truly wonderful experience it is. Absolutely fantastic, thanks Musent.
