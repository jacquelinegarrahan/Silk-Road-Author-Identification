				I was just wondering why there is not any vendors in North America that sell mephedrone.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried researching this topic but haven&#039;t found any reasons just requests for it.&nbsp; Im tired of having to wait for it to be shipped from Europe, although Wertu&#039;s stuff is so good its worth the wait.

				Supply and demand is my guess -- and European consumers tend to pay more for 4-MMC so its less profitable for a US vendor to buy some to sell. Its also on high alert on the export side customs since the &quot;Meow Meow&quot; BS articles (including the lie about it being called Meow meow) gave it too much attention.<br /><br />This is just an uninformed guess though. Be wary of it being cut with 4-MEC too. <br /><br />Good luck, I wouldnt mind a domestic vendor selling some. I like a serotonin mindfuck every now and again.

				It&#039;s just a fact basically no one in the United States does meph. The craze hit Europe not here my friend. Ketamine used to be really popular in Europe and no one ever did it here. Now things are changing.

Although, I&#039;m not for sure I&#039;ve ever had a proper &quot;coke high&quot; before, I&#039;m not sure. So take what I say knowing I&#039;ve done both drugs only 3-4 times each. <br /><br />Mephedrone gives you an extremely euphoric feeling. It&#039;s very hard to keep your tongue in your mouth and your brain in your head. When it first hits you, you will be talking your ass off. Everyone who does it starts talking. You&#039;ll talk about things you&#039;ve never talked about before, just confessing stuff, because it makes you feel so empathic and so free of inhibition -- which is part of the reason it became a public concern is because people were doing weird stuff while on it. Your mind feels like it just took of on a rocket ship straight to Everything&#039;s Okay Land to ride the No Fucks Giving Roller Coaster all day. Your clothes feel amazing on your skin, it&#039;s hard to eat, but your jaws are constantly moving because it feels good to do so and sweet things like candy taste so absolutely amazing that you&#039;ll never want to shallow them.&nbsp; You&#039;ve got a do a line every HOUR or so, not sooner, you&#039;ll OD quick if you do it more than once an hour. And that hour is going to FLY by too. <br /><br />The first time I had it, I&#039;ve never done hard drugs before, never insufflated anything either. So I took some orally and started to feel very calm, like drunk, very happy. So I decided to try a line. The second I got up I was blown away, I started talking my ass off and I couldn&#039;t keep my head from bobbing back and forth over and over because it felt really amazing to do so. It was so bad my friends had to drive my car to the party we were going back at my neighbors house. I couldn&#039;t keep my head straight for the life of me, hahaha. It was a rush, but after an hour or two it was just a tiny glow. It goes away about as suddenly as it comes on. <br /><br />Now in comparison to coke -- I never even feel anything from coke. The first time I had coke I was expecting something like mephedrone, but it wasn&#039;t there. Coke just felt more like having a lot of useless energy. Mephedrone comes on in waves, so something you want to sit and other times you want to stand, but you&#039;ll be sweating your ass off. Coke just feels like a quiet surge of energy and impatience, never want to sit, never want to be calm. <br /><br />I think I need more coke to give you a better analysis mr.cocaineandhookers, but I&#039;ll bet you&#039;d really enjoy mephedrone. That&#039;s all I can say with certainty.&nbsp;

Two different kinds of psychostimulants. MDPV is a potent NDRI and Mephedrone/4-MMC is a SNDRI. Simply put, Meph is an entactogen -- it makes you more socialable and bumps up serotonin. MDPV in contrast does not alter serotonin and often does not increase lovey-dovey feelings like entactogenic stimulants do. Ones for nightclubbing, the other is for being able to stay laser sharp focused on a productive activity for long periods. Serotonin is much more finite than Dopamine and slower to replenish, so use 4-MMC and other entactogens sparingly unless you like mental roller coaste rides ;)<br /><br />Some irresponsible MORONS combined MDPV and 4-MMC and even other stuff into &quot;bath salt&quot; products and using both even at small doses can cause serious cardio issues, psychosis, and serotonin syndrome among other things. I equate those responsible with the assholes who cut heroin with fentanyl and sell 2C-* as LSD (both resulting in serious injuries and deaths even for responsible users). This coupled with the problem of people insufflating extreme doses assuming you need a whole &quot;line&quot; and it was a news media wet dream. Please do not ever buy from convenience stores that sell these branded bath salts, or head shops. Buy from places that disclose the contents. And boycott anyone in the business who engages in irresponsible selfish actions. <br /><br />Its one thing if someone dies from using a drug that was labelled properly. That is on the user.<br /><br />But to die from something like that bath salt shit (note im referring to the shit being sold in gas stations that doesnt disclose contents -- not MDPV and 4-MMC themself) the asshole who produced them is partially responsible. Just like those poor bastards that overdose because they inject heroin when in fact its mostly fentanyl or some toxic analog of fentanyl. Please, if you are going to adulterate your shit with active drugs, disclose it to the buyer. <br /><br />Never sell one thing as something else because one could be non-toxic and the other could be very toxic. <br /><br />Practice proactive harm reduction and educate people to save lives so we stop having hysteria in the news media over this drug or that drug. <br /><br />I am glad to say that all things I&#039;ve bought here at SR have not been adulterated with either inert or active substances. If you insist on selling unscheduled psychoactives in gas stations, then disclose the contents at least. RCs including fentanyl analogs were used and sold on clearnet websites in the 90s and 00s without much fuss.. until some greedy SOB decided to mass market proprietary mixtures of stuff to convenience stores with no regard for safety. I&#039;ve known MDPV users for 8 years and they never had psychotic breaks because they were informed consumers, buying from vendors who disclosed as much as they could (sometimes even copies of their HPLC report from their Chinese lab for that batch). I was saddened deeply when I learned this stuff was being sold as proprietary &quot;bath salts&quot; without adequate labelling. <br /><br />Anyway, 4-MMC is very potent and like every other drug, its up to you to use it responsibly or not. Just please take time to research available data on pharmacology and interactions (serotonin syndrome in particular from MANY Rxed SSRIs, MAOIs, etc) and invest in a decent milligram scale. <br /><br />

I become very confident and feel on top of the world, sometimes this can lead to cockiness, but as long as your head is screwed on right, this confidence just leads to connectivity with others. With MDMA, it&#039;s like everything in the world is beautiful and friendly and therefore you have no anxiety or stress about anything, with coke you can remain very sober (or at least not intoxicated) but because you feel great and are so confident, nothing could get in your way.<br /><br />Atleast that&#039;s for about 30-40 minutes before you comedown, and you need to do another line to feel on top of the world again.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fun drug, but it&#039;s the kind of thing that can absorb your whole night, rather than having a night out with friends, your night is about being out with friends and doing coke, seems to change the dynamic a little bit.&nbsp; For this reason I save it for special occasions.

Due to massive budget strains, less and less non-bulky mail gets put on the random inspection belt these days, its expensive to have both canines and professional handlers getting paid $20 an hour to watch dogs walk up and down and USPS in recent years has been getting gutted in terms of budget and ICE is refocused on the border trying to keep pesticide-laden cannabis and levamisole adulterated with a small amount of cocaine from coming in mostly to keep up appearances that we are &quot;winning the good fight&quot; the proverbial shit-eating grin by some district attorney invoking that cliche of a phrase &quot;dope on the table&quot;. <br /><br />PM him, and remember to use GPG to encrypt if your msg contains sensitive info.

Don&#039;t be like &quot;100% REFUND NOW YOU SCAMMER!&quot; lol and if the vendor doesnt reply to you and doesnt accept a proposed resolution, then SR staff will resolve it [and in my experience, they do a damn good job of weighing fair resolutions...] <br /><br />Always give benefit of the doubt and dialogue with your vendor if problems arise before assuming the worst. :) Always finalize as early as possible and always give feedback that rates discretion of package, quality of product (remember, you can edit this later, so you dont neeed to wait til you use before giving feedback) and how good the transit time was, as well as dialogue. Finalizing early should only be done if you have a long business relationship of buying/selling with the person and its an optional courtesy.

But make sure to pm the vendor to tell him/her why [and use GPG if mentioning sensitive details] help them be discreet because they might not have known. Anytime you just finalize and leave the default &quot;Leave feedback here&quot; you miss an opportunity to help the community grow.

				Mephedrone is dirty and gives you a very unclean high. It&#039;s fucking cheap but it shows! If you take a lot you are just fucked and out of control, the comedown is dreadful too. Good coke, you can tell, is much cleaner and better for your nose. The comedown isn&#039;t nearly as bad and you can get away with being on it in a club, whereas with mephedrone it&#039;s just too obvious.

				there isnt none there cause the real deal is hard to get hold of. theres so many deriratives like 4 mec, 4 emc people have actually forgot what real drone feels like. the market for a particular fucks when the chinese labs start to find a replacement. the 3 majors were mdpv, meph, methylone. only place iv found real meph after a while is on here. its hard to get hold of just like good coke is. glad sr is here. but i reckon as there are 1-2 vendors that have the real deal they should arrange distribution in the usa. would make life easier

				nrg was a mixture of mdpv and other things. there are reports online on what mixtures they used and they kept changing them. id never touched pre packaged branded stuff that is labelled as plant food. mephedrone isnt as bad as people think it is. the chineese are very greedy and to be competitive they left all the impurities which they pass on to the customer. with meph it would be sensible to take precautions like limiting yourself to 1g per night. if you have an additive nature then dont purchase 5g etc. i always have benzos at hand as well. with meph valium is the best one because it has vasodilation properties that last upto 30 minutes. where as xanax doesnt. the cleaner the better and iv always noticed the indian crystals were always the cleanest. the chinese had excellent meph in 2009 but the market grew very fast and greed became the topic.

				Not sure why, probably because of the media, bath salt scare, &quot;zombie&quot; epidemic, etc. and MPDV in general giving 4-MMC a bad name (both drugs are dirty as fuck btw, not defending them at all) Outside of a hardcore group of users who can&#039;t get real drugs, There&#039;s a general distrust of synthetics from the people I&#039;ve talk too about it. I did some research on it, and most of this shit comes from China &amp; India, the type of countries that give people life sentences/executions for possessing/manufacturing any type of illegal drug (was invented/synthesized originally in Russia). Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if these synthetics are some kind of underground/asymmetrical warfare being waged by these countries against the US, funded by their governments.
