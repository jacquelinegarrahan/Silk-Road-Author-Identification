				So I have access to several bank accounts that are very well funded. What I need and would appreciate are ideas on how to anonymously buy bitcoins with these accounts. I woulod like to get roughly 10-30k in coins. I was thinking western union through one of the vendors but am unsure. Any ideas on how to get coin through these would be greatly appreciated. I have account numbers, routing numbers, social, D.O.B, address. Basically everything. If someone can tell me how to procure the funds safely, I would be more than happy to transfer some coin to the person with the best idea that gets me the coin. Thanks

				I don&#039;t remember saying that I stole these accounts. Perhaps they&#039;re my accounts that my wife won&#039;t let me access for various personal reasons. Perhaps a friends who is in the same situation. Perhaps a thousand different things that someone like yourself, who participates in a site that sells drugs to an unknown amount of people, many who are children, shouldn&#039;t make assumptions or be as judgmental as Hitler loving Nazi.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want the coin, don&#039;t reply

				the face that you have the money in the bank account makes it non stealth<br /><br />you need to go make a cash withdrawl and then find someone to trade with in person to be annymous... not to mention mixing up the coins even after you receive<br /><br />check out localbitcoins.com
