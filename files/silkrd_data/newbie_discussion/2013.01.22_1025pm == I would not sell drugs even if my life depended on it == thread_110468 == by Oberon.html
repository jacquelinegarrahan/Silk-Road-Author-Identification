				Well I went to an IVY league university and here I am selling drugs. A Harvard study has proven that weed reduces tumors by 50% when used as treatment so I strongly belief in the product I sell and many other studies also support this finding. <br /><br />Also I like the freedom it gives me to not work inside the system for the system and deal with all the bureaucracy and stupid office politics and fake interactions that come along with it. <br /><br />I hope I can continue making money unconventionally using a decentralize currency that I belief in bc I sure as hell do not trust the federal reserve and hope it gets shut down.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t like a lot of the stereotypes associated with dealing drugs because I feel like i&#039;m doing something good and positive for someone when they get hooked up with some dank weed or fire acid. I actually give a lot of free doses to people and this is technically distribution of a schedule I substance which seems silly.

				suppose its personal choice and circumstances that dictate the decision. But thank God for SR. I can finally get top quality products at good prices, without any bullshit or hassle of waiting around or being treated like a jerk by a two bit thief. I think SR has added professionalism to the trade which it desperately needed. I know 99% of the dealers I have got drugs from, wouldnt have a inkling about SR. And if they ever tried to sell on here, the lack of professionalism and service would finish them. THANKS SR, I LOVE YOU.

				I feel like I thought I would never sell drugs until I started doing enough where it became profitable as opposed to a drain on my bank account. SR does definitely add the element of professionalism where you&#039;re not dealing with drug addicts, but people, like you who do drugs but are still functioning. (or at least have a computer) ;)

				A business is a business, no matter how you look at it. What is illegal today, could be legal tomorrow. I don&#039;t agree with the selling of weapons, but in many cases this is a perfectly legitimate, successful, wide-spanning profession... and also an equally large and profitable illegitimate one. Stigma towards certain things will always exist, especially in a society that labels such things. That being said... opium and coca are some of the oldest drugs known to man, and if not for their early discoveries as either a potent euphoric experience or their success in medicine, we wouldn&#039;t know many of the things today that make surgery tolerable. They have their absolute downsides, Opium has also been the direct cause of more than a few very... very extreme conflicts. But hell, cocaine built the railroads... and I can&#039;t imagine what surgery would be like without an opiate or a cocaine (or similar *caine) local anesthetic.

				Depends on the drug and the context.&nbsp; I buy a decent amount of weed at a time and don&#039;t smoke much, selling most of it to a few friends of mine for cost so they have access.&nbsp; Technically that&#039;s selling, but it&#039;s such small amounts that where I&#039;m from I wouldn&#039;t even get charged.<br />More heavily regulated/punishable drugs I&#039;d be wary of (like coke or mdma, which get the same treatment in Canada) I feel pretty uncomfortable with on me at a bar in small amounts even.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve personally never done any drugs in my life so far and while that might change later it would most likely only be for something like Ayahuasca, DMT or Ibogaine. Circumstance has led me to the drug retail business where I handle the technical side of things along with intelligence on things like Law Enforcement and improving packaging. My business partner handles the drug aspect and has been in the business for several years himself as both an importer and grower of his own cannabis, although he fairly recently got the trust of a big time importer which has changed the dynamics a bit. The reason I decided to take the final step to become a drug dealer was not an ideological one at first, I&#039;ve been unemployed for several years by now and if society puts zero value on me I simply have to find some other way of providing value. Time will tell if me and my business partner will be successful but we have a good combination of skills which I think can go far as long as we don&#039;t get caught.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Might sound semi-corny but Silk Road itself and the spirit of Dread Pirate Roberts in a sense for me has transformed the drug dealing job into an ideology where the purpose is to be unrestricted by constructs of society - I will not say governments as unfortunately the reality is they have very large support of the people in general. For me personally I&#039;m in it for the long run now simply because drugs should not be outlawed, and until we&#039;ve gotten rid of these laws as a society we will stay stagnant in these areas indefinitely.
