				Good Day All,<br /><br />Is it okay to access the TOR network through a university wifi, I have to enter my university credentials to access the wifi. From what I understand once I&#039;m connected to the wifi and funneling activities through TOR, it won&#039;t connect my login with the TOR traffic, rather it will simply show that someone is using TOR (not necessarily me). Is this correct or am I offbase?<br /><br />Also, I have another question about shipping. I currently live in an apartment that has had numerous past residents, should I use their info for shipping or would it be okay just to use mine in case of mail mix-ups or forwarding the mail (I only plan on ordering personal use amounts), I also don&#039;t want to use previous tenants names since I want to keep my use of sr to myself only and don&#039;t want to have to explain to current roommates why I&#039;m accepting past tenants mail, any opinions on this? I live in a large city so would that help reduce the chances of notice?<br /><br />Any help or opinions are greatly appreciated

				I would use the real name, since post people sometimes notice things like that. You just want it to blend in with all your other mail, not stand out to anyone. <br /><br />And I&#039;ve connected to tor through my uni WiFi, but I also used a boot able USB to connect through tor.
