				<br />That is one flaw in this veil of obscurity we all enjoy here - if you ship to your home address, the vendor gets to know your real identity. However, I&#039;m not too worried about that myself. I don&#039;t know which country you live in, but seriously, do you think the police would be granted a search warrant from a *very* anonymous tip sent to them from a dodgy source? From a legal perspective, it might very well be considered an extremely clumsy setup - send a politician you despise drugs, tip the authorities, and *poof* they are spending the next part of their life in jail?&nbsp; :P<br />...And how would the police judge the information from the anonymous source? &quot;Hey, I KNOW he has illegal drugs - I sold it to him myself!&quot;<br />Report the bastard to admins with screenshots of the message transaction, but don&#039;t worry too much.<br />
