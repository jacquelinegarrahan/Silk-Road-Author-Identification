				I really wish I could post this in the proper forum, but unfortunately I don&#039;t really have the time/inclination to spam to 50. Maybe I will at some point, though. Either way, I&#039;m glad to do my part to prevent that awful spamming bullshit we had to deal with. <br /><br />My question here is very basic. I just want to know, basically, how a VPN works. From what I&#039;ve read, they create an encrypted pipeline to the internet, but what does that mean for security in addition to TOR? The real reason I wanted to get a VPN was so my ISP can&#039;t &quot;spy&quot; on what I&#039;m doing on the clearnet, but, more importantly, can&#039;t decisively know whether or not I&#039;m using TOR (I have heard ISPs have ways of knowing by simply checking their database records). In this day in age, SR is no longer underground. We have to face facts - LE aren&#039;t stupid. If you&#039;re using TOR, that in and of itself may be grounds for investigation - maybe not today, but someday. Especially if you have a previous criminal record. So I&#039;m wondering, does this VPN work to prevent my ISP from knowing any of the sites I&#039;m connecting to, and, more importantly, whether or not I&#039;m using TOR?<br /><br />Thanks for any and all responses.<br /><br />(Maybe a nice mod will move this to the security section? ;) )

				There are several discussions about this in the forums just search tor vpn but the best advice if you go this route is to use a vpn like mullvad (there are others but I don&#039;t recall them) which accept bitcoin for payment and check their privacy policy to see if they promise not to keep logs, although there&#039;s no guarantee of that either.<br /><br />here is a clearnet link discussing pros and cons of vpns:<br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#you-X-Tor<br /><br />one forum discussion: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147608.msg1019915#msg1019915<br /><br />good luck

If you&#039;re using TOR, that in and of itself may be grounds for investigation - maybe not today, but someday. Especially if you have a previous criminal record. So I&#039;m wondering, does this VPN work to prevent my ISP from knowing any of the sites I&#039;m connecting to, and, more importantly, whether or not I&#039;m using TOR?<br /><br />Thanks for any and all responses.<br /><br />(Maybe a nice mod will move this to the security section? ;) )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are already many threads in the Security forum discussing this very topic. It is possible to run Tor through a VPN in order to hide the fact that you&#039;re using Tor from your ISP.<br /><br />Just a few threads I found with a quick search:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=49275<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45249<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85322<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150472<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to use the Search function - that&#039;s what it&#039;s there for! :) Do the search from inside whichever forum or thread you wish to search through, or to search all of the forums just search from the forum homepage.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Libertas. And sorry, I always UTSE. I did actually type in &quot;vpn,&quot; &quot;isp,&quot; etc. but I did not come across a thread that answered my question. But these are fantastic, thank you.<br /><br />Also, from my previous searches I heard mullvad was the best and that they don&#039;t keep logs. Can anyone corroborate this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No problem at all! :)<br /><br />As a mod I personally don&#039;t want to recommend any VPN provider in case others take that up as me (or even Silk Road) endorsing them. All I&#039;ll say is that you can&#039;t really be sure that your VPN provider isn&#039;t going to be keeping logs. Whichever one you want to go with, you should ALWAYS use a VPN provider that you can pay anonymously (with Bitcoin for instance), and never let the rest of your security drop just because you&#039;ll be using a VPN.<br /><br />Hopefully others can chime in here with their own VPN experiences, but go have a browse through the first few pages of the Security forum and you might find a few recommendations etc.<br /><br />Libertas

				I&#039;ve used tor since 2004. I don&#039;t see much correlation between it and SR myself.

				In response to the OP, the use of a VPN encrypts your connection from your router (if implemented at the router level), or your computer (if the VPN software is installed directly on your computer), to the VPN provider. The provider then provides an exit node, whereby your connection will be out in the open if not using some form of end-to-end encryption, such as SSL. So even the lousy VPN providers will encrypt your connection from your point of access to the provider&#039;s network- but they&#039;ll still know where you&#039;re going on the internet because you can bet your ass that they keep logs. The good thing is that a hundred other people could be using the same node, making sniffing for a correlation a nightmare for any snoops (LE or otherwise).<br /><br />I strongly recommend the use of VPN. You just have to choose one that meets all of the following conditions:<br /><br />a) they don&#039;t keep any logs at all, or log for a maximum of less than a week for diagnostic and anti-spamming purposes only (self explanatory)<br />b) they accept Bitcoin as a form of payment (total anonymity: no one will know who you are as a customer to begin with)<br />c) they have a guide for setup on a router (absolutely vital if you want all of your computers and devices behind the VPN)<br />d) they aren&#039;t headquarted in your country (always diversify)<br />e) they offer openvpn (none of that pptp or l2tp garbage, please)<br /><br />I can also add good feedback and rep online by people who are extremely concerned about protecting their privacy and anonymity. The same goes for their efforts to circumvent new ways of government blocking and interception, such as what China is doing right now. They&#039;ve been blocking Tor for more than a couple of years now and have found ways to kill VPN connections by looking for OpenVPN &quot;handshakes&quot;, which is what the protocol is doing at the IP level to make a connection. Some providers are looking at tunneling OpenVPN over SSH or SSL, which makes it highly impractical to block (they have to kill all non-VPN SSH and SSL traffic)<br /><br />TorrentFreak on clearnet has a couple of posts about VPN providers which respect privacy. Plenty of reviews there, complete with a Q&amp;A from the TF writers.<br /><br />One last thing: using Tor over a logless VPN, paid with Bitcoin and maintained with a Tormail address, is the gold standard of internet anonymity and privacy. It can only be defeated locally by physical intervention.

				Even if your ISP knows that you are using tor, there is nothing illegal in that.<br /><br />A VPN would make it so that your ISP doesn&#039;t know what you are browsing, but the VPN provider would know... and that might be worse. Even the VPN who say they don&#039;t keep logs most likely keep logs to deal with potential abuses (child porn and the like)..<br /><br />TOR with a decent firewall (like Tails has for example) would be the perfect solution IMHO.. It&#039;s free and you can also browse the clearnet with it, making that your isp doesn&#039;t know what the shit you are doing online...
