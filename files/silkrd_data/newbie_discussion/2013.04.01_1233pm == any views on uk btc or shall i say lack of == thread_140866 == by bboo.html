				Does anyone know whats going on with blockchain i cant bank transfer money in the uk. All i want is to get fucking high every other country you seem to be able to buy BTC with ease but in the uk its becoming more and more difficult and at the moment i am at a loss on how to be able to get BTC&#039;s without paying over the odds. Frustrated is not the word to cover I just want Drugs man it&#039;s not to much to ask is it? iv&#039;e only been a member of silk road for just over a month and I would hate not to be able to use the services now that I have found the inner sanctum.<br />So if anyone can give advice on buying BTC in the uk it would be greatly appreciated.<br />Hope your all having a great easter weekend.

				UK transfer through transferwise.com to Mt.Gox or any other EU exchanges bank account and buy BTC that way.<br /><br />Fees are minimal this way. <br />Or find a local seller on localbitcoins

				its the bloody uk goverment trying to crack down probably because there is no way for them to make money from it they are cracking down on transfer&#039;s in the uk for bitcoins, it dont half fuck me off its my right what i put in my body and if im not commiting harm or loss to anyone else then let me be. anyway im going to try and buy bitcoins from the sr seems the only route for now really.

				try btcxuk@tormail.org if you&#039;re not in a rush, i&#039;ve used him with no problems and his rates are better than the btc sellers on here. he can be a bit slow, there&#039;s a thread about his service on these forums. remember it&#039;s always at your own risk though, there is no escrow to protect you.
