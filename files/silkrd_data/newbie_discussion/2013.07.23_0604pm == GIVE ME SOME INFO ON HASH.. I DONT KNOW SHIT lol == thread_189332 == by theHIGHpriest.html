I don&#039;t know the difference between hash(s) and I dont know for better hash if I should look at a International vendor or a Domestic (USA) vendor. ... if anyone has any kind of insight on hash (bubble,wax,regular hash) or whatever is out there.. please help a brother out!!!! I would appreciate this. <br /><br />Thanks, theHIGHpriest

				interesting question, i was hoping to see a few answers here - considering how the world of drugs have changed since the late 60s/early 70s i was hoping to see new, innovative techniques for smoking it<br /><br />back in the 60s, when it was rarely available, we&#039;d jump on it - it was the resin off the plants so it was the creme de la creme - we&#039;d put a small chunk in a small pipe bowl and keeping a ligher flame on it, suck or draw thru the pipe like a motherfucker - wouldn&#039;t take a couple of hits to put you away for the night<br /><br />with all the equipment i see offered, ie vaporizers, etc i was hoping there were new and more controlled ways (ie more efficient) to consume it<br /><br />maybe someone will step up to the plate<br /><br />fwiw

				hash i made from compressed trichomes off the marijuana plant.&nbsp; by weight, the trichomes are the richest in active cannabinoids of any part of the marijuana plant, so collecting them for smoking greatly reduces the amount of plant material that needs to be burned for a pleasurable high to be achieved.<br /><br />there are several ways of collecting these trichomes.&nbsp; most involve special screens with holes of exact specifications.&nbsp; You can get hash with inferior screens, but it&#039;s going to have more fibrous and leafy material in it than those designed for only a trichome to fit through and little else.&nbsp; some methods use cold temperatures to make the trichome brittle and thus easier to break free of the leafy matter.&nbsp; other methods involve just rubbing the plants in your hands and scraping the accumulated thrichomes off.<br /><br />the smoke contains concentrated cannabinoids, so the high is the same.&nbsp; it is more potent, though, so easier to inhale more of the drug than you would smoking bud.&nbsp;

				Personally tHp, I think hash is overrated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent almost a decade in the middle east and not too many of those day were without a bowl or two (mostly more) of some of the blackest, stickiest hash you&#039;ve (n)ever seen!&nbsp; In fact, you couldn&#039;t find the leafy version if your life depended on it.&nbsp; Also in the late 70&#039;s in Sicily almost 3 years in the military (pre- piss test era) smoking what we called Lebanese Blond among other types I&#039;ve forgotten - again, almost every day.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, and trying some of the finer strains of buds here in the states (and Amsterdam), I would take weed any day of the week.&nbsp; Better tasting, better smelling, and much purer without any additives.&nbsp; JMO and hope that helps.

				Nowadays there are four main ways to extract hashish.<br /><br />Rubbing is the classic method that has been abandoned nearly everywhere due to commercial and quality reasons.<br /><br />Dry sieving is sieving dried plants, usually per beating them with sticks like a drummer and collecting the powder which is then sold as Polm / Pollen which is slightly pressed or its sold as harder pressed hashish. Normally in high quality hashish the resins will turn black through oxidation which shows in pressed hashish being dark to black on the outside. You can usually tell of the shininess and wetness of its good product.<br />Polm is usually divided into qualities, since they sieve plants more than once. Obviously the first sieving is the best and the third or fourth is used for Standard. Often Standard gets thinned down at the farm with other material - in the old days it was Henna nowadays I think they like bird-sand, but not sure hvent smoked cut product in ages.<br /><br />Wet sieving is used in the Ice-o-lator process which is a sieving process with extremely small holes being used in connection with bud / trimmings being put into ice-cold water together with ice-cubes. This hardens the trichomes and makes it easier to let them pass thru the 25+micron sieves. <br />Ice-O-Lator is usually very pure but can have disappointing taste since the less plant material you get the less actual taste you have - in addition the broadness of the cannabinoid spectrum becomes decreased - in the best case you have product that gives you exactly what you want and only that, in the worst case it gives you nothing. This is a typical problem for all hq hashish, also probably being caused by small holes letting through less ripe glands.<br /><br />Oil extraction: Usually using coffee-filters this method uses different gasses to extract the fluid resin from the plant material. Stuff will be called Dab or BHO or Wax or Glass or whatever shiny name they give it :P This kind of hashish is mostly created in the &quot;medical Marijuana&quot; scene, which is really just a name for high-end junkies. I would keep away from that stuff, the body cant metabolize the cannabinoids quick enough, 11-thc-ooh will go into your fat in masses and you&#039;ll be stoned for months after stopping, possibly get dopamine-deficiency and other shit.<br /><br />In any event, if you&#039;ve never smoked hash go for an easy polm.<br /><br />cu<br /><br />J.

				Butane Honey Oil, or CO2 extracted oils are all the rage right now. If you want clean, pure concentrated cannbinoids and providing it&#039;s done right, it doesn&#039;t get any better. Can get as high as 80-90+% pure THC. Dabbing this stuff with a proper oil rig will knock your socks off.<br /><br />A good full melt bubble hash is close, then maybe a good quality dry sift kief. The rest is practically garbage in comparison. IMO, of course. Most people i know wouldn&#039;t touch charas. It&#039;s hand rubbed off of live, outdoor and likely very seeded plants. Who the hell wants someones grubby hands all over your stuff? lol

The result is I think called Dutch Standard or something and is hard as a brick naturally. It doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be bad though, it depends on the amount of oil, its quality and the quality of the leftovers they use.<br /><br />Then of course there&#039;s soap-bar which might contain machine-oil or industrial glue - you&#039;re not looking for that ;-).<br /><br />If the sieve / rub is good there is no necessity to put oil into the hash. Oil is already in there, nicely protected in the wax skin of the resin glands.
