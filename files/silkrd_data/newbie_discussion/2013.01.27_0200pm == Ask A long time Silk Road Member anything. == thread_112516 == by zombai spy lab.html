				Thanks for reaching down into the muck to help us newbies.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve made 4 purchases now and 3 of 4 were perfect.&nbsp; The 4th, blow, seemed light and while it was good - I was expecting better quality.

Be sure to ask the vendor if he really doe s calibrate the scale on every order.<br /><br /><br />I suggest all vendors be contacted with simple questions to have them answer generally , this will improve your information on which vendors are gonna be real professional vendors a or smoke blowers to just get sale and always review your orders in the forum. Don;t hesitate to ask a vendor before placing orders it&#039;s both their and your privilege to get a transaction .<br />Most vendors will go out of their way to make a buyer happy. If a vendor is rude to you I would suggest you not give them your business.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also sorry missed second post: Domestic orders are beyond simple and safe I&#039;d not order beyond canada simply because you are gonna wait from 8-15 days for the package to arrive depending on source location from the UK to Germany

If you are getting over sea orders it isnt needed but sometimes vendor do use it as insurance to have proof an overseas package arrived in case a buyer tries to scam the vendor and say it didnt arrive. I suggest you not ever order large from over seas and in fact orders in general are gonna get you in the most trouble but if you are doing it to resell I guess sometimes you have to weigh the pros and cons. All international orders are gonna get looked at and that simply is not a domestic problem unless the vendor is not a professional packer.<br /><br /><br />To be honest with you though if your package hets all the way to you at the normal mail delivery time then there is most likely no problems with the package and it would be safe to sign but I personally dont sign anything and suggest others dont either.

				Hey, thanks for opening this thread :)<br />Do you think it&#039;s a good idea to tell a vendor before buying one of their products that you plan on writing a review of it on the forums? Or does that come off as gloating and an attempt at getting special care over one&#039;s order.<br />- JH

				Hey Zombai. Also, like others have stated, I&#039;m sure we all appreciate the guidance and words of advice.<br /><br />My question for you is more of a scenario. The situation I&#039;m in is that I&#039;m ordering from the U.S. trying to get some LSD. After looking at the sellers, the most legitimate one (in terms of reviews and price) is this seller called Lucydrop (ships from Canada). He&#039;s in the top 2% of sellers with 99.6% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions.<br /><br />The Catch = He requires you to FE. I know that pretty much everyone tells you to never, ever FE, but I&#039;m wondering if this seller&#039;s extensive history and rank might be validation enough. Obviously it comes down to whether or not I want to risk it, but I&#039;m asking what you would do if you were the newbie in my position.<br /><br />Thanks for the help man :)

				I mean for God&#039;s sake between the LSD Avengers and all sorts of crap ive made two lsd purchases, one soooo very weak it didnt even have a mental effect, the other just paper. im on my third and starting to think i need to wait for a star vendor to have new new batch, read the threads, and buy a shit ton at once. might be worth it. im just sick of this crap already. people playing games with lsd. they have something that could give so many people hope and joy and decided to give us zero or a 1/100th of the dose. unreal. what happened to the Dead Days? I&#039;m still search, but I swear sometimes it keeps me up at night,

Where did you find this information if I may ask?<br /><br />As for my question; How do you go about ordering weed in the 100 g- 500 g range if not more. Assuming you live in a Nordic country with relatively strict customs and domestic product being way too expensive (1300 usd for 100 g even on sr), so naturally you opt for non-flagged EU countries to send you this amount. Why exactly is it NOT good to sign for your package? Are they always checked and scrutinized extensively regardless of how good the stealth is or is it the fact that it can be an opportunity to screw you over?<br /><br />Many thanks in advance!

				Thanks Zombai.<br /><br />Not sure if you&#039;ll get to this... but being the total noob I am, I&#039;m not sure where to ask this... nor have I found the answers anywhere else:<br /><br />Why is there no link to the actual SR Market here?... apparently an account here is completely detached from there, correct?&nbsp; And clicking on random vendors links only brought me to a login page which would not allow new registrations.&nbsp; &quot;temporarily not accepting new members atm&quot;&nbsp; Guess I&nbsp; got lucky though after doing enough clearnet searching, I found a link that would let me register.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t not having an obvious direct link from here open noobs up to phishing?... like LE could set up a mirror SR or something... or some sort of pass-through/overlay claiming to be SR, a more easily found SR?&nbsp; Fooling lost people like me.<br /><br />How does one become&nbsp; a vendor?...

				Have you ever heard of anyone catching a case from using Silk Road? I read about someone who used both Silk Road along with Paypal and they got caught up because of the Paypal connection, but I am wondering what is the best safeguards against any problems on the Road. <br />Also, is there any problem with consistently logging on to the Tor network from one location?

Your ISP i.e LE, could easily find out if you are using Tor but this is as far as they can get. They can only know you use Tor, not what you do AT ALL while using Tor. But, there are exceptions, if you do not listen to the guidelines of how to use Tor safely then you can breach the security of Tor by surfing non-secure websites and what not. Do not leave software opened on your computer when using Tor if the software can access the internet in any way whether it is Skype or something else. Also, you should encrypt your hard drive with TrueCrypt, just make sure to turn your computer off if LE are coming for you! :) <br /><br />I hope this helped,<br /><br />Entity

				Thanks EntityCreature,<br /><br />But I am using Windows 8 which in and of itself is constantly connected to the internet. Also what about the antivirus, antimalware software that is continually monitoring internet traffic? Should I not use any of this stuff?

The only way to have an idea as to what is inside the package is if it is accurately labeled on the customs form, providing it is coming from another country. If it has been sent domestically then there won&#039;t be a way to identify the contents, however I&#039;m pretty sure most packages we send over SR aren&#039;t accurately labeled anyway ;)<br /><br />If you pick up a package from the post office, and have to sign for it, then the principle is the same as if it was received by you directly at your residence. It may be an indication that you are aware of the contents / expecting the package, and so a claim that someone sent you illegal narcotics as a set-up may not be accepted. I still think that signing for packages containing small amounts is relatively safe, as if the package&#039;s contents had been discovered by customs they would have probably just sent you a letter informing you that they have seized the package. Only if you were ordering large amounts would they bother carrying out a controlled delivery; delivering the package, waiting for you to sign for it and then arresting you and carrying out a search (providing they have a warrant) of the residence. Of course they will arrest you for possession of a &#039;suspected&#039; illegal narcotic and possibly with intent to supply or some other bull-shit. <br /><br />All in all, if you&#039;re ordering small amounts, or from a vendor who is experienced with stealthily packaging larger amounts, then you will probably be safe. That being said, I only order with tracked shipping/signing when for some reason I need to know exactly where the package is along its journey, all the rest of the time I just order via regular mail. If you&#039;re planning on a bigger order, check the vendor&#039;s feedback for larger orders and see if you can find out whether people normally order with tracking/signing from them, and if they&#039;ve been successful. I understand it&#039;s a debate; you want to have tracking because you don&#039;t want to loose a big order, but you don&#039;t want it because of the possible legal repercussions. At the end of the day it&#039;s your call.<br /><br />Hope this helped,<br />- JH

I understand it&#039;s a debate; you want to have tracking because you don&#039;t want to loose a big order, but you don&#039;t want it because of the possible legal repercussions. At the end of the day it&#039;s your call.<br /><br />Hope this helped,<br />- JH<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Heya Joe,<br /><br />I am happy I have learned this useful stuff, it is definitely making me feel more confident with my endeavors here. I did not know that was the case for your country and other EU countries. I did once notice this label thing you mentioned, I did not much care for it until now. <br /><br />Yep, it sounds logical in every way to approach this conundrum in the manner you have suggested. Indeed, it is ultimately up to me. You have to be able to sacrifice to manage in this world, I believe, so it is not necessarily a dilemma to have to choose between these. Thank you, JoeyHartley, be seeing you in the forums :)!<br /><br />Sincerely yours,<br /><br />Enity

				That&#039;s an inordinate amount of time.&nbsp; I REALLY appreciate your control in NOT spamming the forums after 20 minutes when they didn&#039;t arrive, but in the future after a few hours I&#039;d start getting a little antsy and message SR support.&nbsp; Check blockchain.info to verify you&#039;ve got the correct address and then see how many confirmations you have.&nbsp; Then message support again.&nbsp; Honestly, If they arrived at this SR marketplace they could just be tied up somewhere and they&#039;ll straighten it out for you.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of funds being tied up for &gt; 24 hours and it getting cleared up.

The situation I&#039;m in is that I&#039;m ordering from the U.S. trying to get some LSD. After looking at the sellers, the most legitimate one (in terms of reviews and price) is this seller called Lucydrop (ships from Canada). He&#039;s in the top 2% of sellers with 99.6% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions.<br /><br />The Catch = He requires you to FE. I know that pretty much everyone tells you to never, ever FE, but I&#039;m wondering if this seller&#039;s extensive history and rank might be validation enough. Obviously it comes down to whether or not I want to risk it, but I&#039;m asking what you would do if you were the newbie in my position.<br /><br />Thanks for the help man :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Excellent question &quot;The Catch&quot; as you put it is exactly what vendors rely on to selectively scam new members randomly. I am in no way saying this vendor scams at all but there are those that do. The ranking and stats is what usually allows them to when 50% if not 100% of the transaction btc. Now if you decide fuck all the advice I&#039;ve been given I&#039;m gonna try and see what happens never finalize early anything more than you are willing to lose at a rigged casino game.

				So, I&#039;m confused about the shipping practices of some (almost all) of the H vendors, esp the international ones.&nbsp; I thought it was one of the golden rules of Sr that you shouldn&#039;t sign for a package, nor go with a vendor who requires it, yet it seems like most of the heroin vendors do (esp for newer users).&nbsp; I get that they&#039;re worried about being scammed out of money if the person claims they didn&#039;t get it when really they did.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t have a dummy/offsite shipping address yet (I&#039;m shipping to my apt under the previous tenants name, who gets a bunch of mail here all the time) and so I&#039;m really paranoid about signing for anything.&nbsp; Plus, I just dont get why this &quot;rule&quot; is being broken by so many of the vendors with great feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;wtf?&nbsp; advice?&nbsp; do I just need to STFU and either get an offsite address or be willing to take the risk of signing for it until I&#039;m more of a known quantity?<br /><br />PS, I may be new to SR but I&#039;m neither new to this drug or to getting busted, which is part of the reason I&#039;m taking the not-signing thing so seriously.<br /><br />

It depends on where you live as different countries have different policies and procedures, some being harder than others to facilitate a successful delivery. However, if your using a previous tenant&#039;s name to receive orders already, you could use it for the signed package delivery. Where I live, even if I had answered the door to the postie and the package wasn&#039;t addressed to me personally, they will still give it to me as the address is correct. If they ask, just say it&#039;s a room mate or your boyfriend/girlfriend, what ever the case may be. If the postie leaves a card cause I&#039;m not at home, on that slip is a section where the addressee can sign it to allow another person to pick it up for them. There&#039;s other steps you can take but I&#039;ll send you a PM shortly about that. :)

When you see them, you need to bookmark the URL of the listing and save it for future use. This could be done by the vendor for many reasons such as they don&#039;t want any new customers for that particular item. There&#039;s not a large percentage of listings which are Stealth when compared to the overall amount of listings on the site. It&#039;s not how you get the best deals. In saying that, I&#039;m sure there are some great deals listed Stealthily, but equally there are great deals in view of everyone. Look around, ask questions if anything is not covered on the vendor&#039;s Homepage, always be polite and courteous and take your time in deciding which vendor to order from. Research, Research and more Research. :)

				Wadozo, I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m a little hurt.&nbsp; After all the good discussions we&#039;ve had you are ignoring MY larger, more informed, centralized, thread and posting on this sad mockery?<br /><br />Honestly, he claims that he&#039;s been a vendor for &gt; 20 months(doubtful) and he can&#039;t even use proper grammar. :/&nbsp; Disappointing.&nbsp; I suppose it is technically POSSIBLE.&nbsp; Though I&#039;d like to point out that there are a LARGE number of people who are in the same boat. See, that long ago you didn&#039;t have to pay for a vendor account.&nbsp; You could just list an item with any account and when you did it changed to a vendor&#039;s account.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t even have to MAKE A SALE.&nbsp; I guess I believe that ZSL has had a vendor account for that long(so have I), but I don&#039;t believe he actually uses it/makes sales.&nbsp; If he does, he&#039;s certainly not a top % vendor.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason for that.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about.&nbsp; Either he hasn&#039;t implemented the things he&#039;s talking about(read: Spewing bullshit), he HAS implemented them and they aren&#039;t successful, or he hasn&#039;t been selling and therefore (likely) doesn&#039;t have the practical knowledge.<br /><br />All these questions have already been answered in my thread.&nbsp; I mean, post here redundantly if you&#039;d like, but seriously.&nbsp; Besides, how often do people get the opportunity to chat with Weird Al?&nbsp; This is a monumental chance people are passing up to ask questions of this inferior, self posturing sham of a &#039;vendor&#039; who&#039;s more likely to give bad information or just rehash what he&#039;s read in my thread.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Much love.<br /><br />By the way, if you&#039;re looking for my thread i believe the reference is on page 2 of this one.&nbsp; Also, on the note of grammar: Yes, I&#039;m aware I didn&#039;t capitalize &#039;he&#039; when referring to ZSL. ;)
