				Hey guys, im looking for a drug that will not show up on a drug test and is similar to MDMA, MDA,bk-MDMA. I understand that these are mainly either not tested for and only in system for a couple days. Please let me know! Also i am looking for something that will not show up with false positives. I understand that this might not be possible and if you think that just let me know. -Dino

				I know it&#039;s not quite the same thing as you don&#039;t get the Love feeling but sometimes truffles (tampanesis etc) can produce a lovely body high. The trouble is it&#039;s variable and sometimes you just trip your pip and other times you can be totally on top of it with body rushes

				bath salt but i would not want you to eat anyone&#039;s face off please dont do it!!! just wait till you take your drug test and then have real MDMA and not worry about it, MDMA will usually be out of your system in 2-4 days from all my experiences

				Yeah, very few things will come close. You can experiment in the research chem field. <br /><br />Though personally, I would just pick up some DMT, and a bag of mushrooms. After a weekend in the forest MDMA is the furthest thing from my mind.

				2c-i is pretty similar to MDA and kind of like MDMA, MBDB would probably not show up on a drug test. The best option though would be to use MDMA and just make sure that your test is at least 2-3 days after use as MDMA is out of your system pretty quickly.

				2ci is nothing like MDMA!!! it is an intense psychadellic. your best bet is methylone- bk-mdma as it is a cathinone not an amphetamine it is not tested for in drug tests.

				Try some 25i tabs.<br />It&#039;s not really like MDMA, but it&#039;s still a pretty awesome drug to have a good night with. It&#039;s cheap, doesn&#039;t show up on any current oral drug tests and has no scent so if you&#039;re say, at a festival, you don&#039;t need to worry about police dogs giving you trouble.<br />:)

I have looked into a few and these and even if not similar to MDMA they look very interested and safe for the most part.

				The closest drug on the planet to mdma without failing a drug test is Methylone, 6-apb is also a good one but harder to get and less tested.

				If you&#039;re gonna try RC&#039;s, which are usually what don&#039;t show up on tests, try 2CB or 4-aco-dmt...
