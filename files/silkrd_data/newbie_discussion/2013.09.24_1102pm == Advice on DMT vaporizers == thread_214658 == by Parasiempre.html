				Absolute newbie here, wondering what people think is the best product on SR to vaporize DMT? I was personally thinking of the Bomb bubble vaporizer, mostly because it&#039;s a cheap option. <br /><br />Any thoughts?

				Well I looked into the GVG and it does sound good from what a lot of people say, but I thought I&#039;d be able to get away with something slightly cheaper.<br />Still, $100 isn&#039;t that much, but it&#039;s always nice to save some money !<br /><br />Thanks for the advice !

				I take a large plastic Hawaiian Punch container, cut out the bottom, get some tinfoil and shape a new bottom for the container using the tinfoil. Use tape or a rubber band to keep it snug. When you&#039;re ready, place the DMT in the tinfoil, and make a cone shape so it stays in one place. Take the top off the container, light underneath the DMT in the cone shaped tinfoil, and inhale. You can cap it, or take it all at once.<br /><br />I found this method on youtube, and it works.

I experienced all of it, so it does take some practice. It will work if you can&#039;t find another method, but to each their own. I like what MachineElves says on their page, about using a bong and loading it with cigarette ash, then dmt. Wish they shipped to the states, but it doesn&#039;t look like it. I&#039;m not a cigarette smoker, but I do have alot of weed ash, so I&#039;m going to try it that way.

				Vapor Genies are the best! If you are serious about DMT (and you should be because its a serious substance) spend the money and get the right tool for the job. It is seriously worth it.

The mission is to inhale smoke!!! But the trick is to not get the smoke to hot... <br /><br />Process:<br /><br />Start by slowly heating the meth pipe (this is dependent on glass thickness).......Once the glass starts getting warm (approaching dmt vaping point) the DMT will turn &quot;oily&quot; and literally start running from the flame/heat... at this point start rolling the bowl (simply rolling/twisting the pipe with your fingers, while inhaling, so the flame/heat is spread evenly across the glass globe) so to avoid &quot;hot spots&quot;... Inhale until you cant......exhale....and repeat (if possible)....<br /><br /><br />Heating:<br /><br />The heating part is key with this type of pipe or any DMT pipe, if not done right you will waste product, not achieve desired effects, and could burn your lungs/mouth... This is why vaporizers/vape genie&#039;s are recommended..(easy/simple/efficient)... Also &quot;the machine&quot; is much more full proof and efficient plus easy to make and cheap/free....<br /><br />The meat:<br /><br />That being said, dump dosage in pipe,&nbsp; Try and keep the flame ~2-1 inches below the glass/dmt (slowly heating)....At the first signs of vapors/smoke start inhaling slowly (hard enough to keep smoke rolling in the pipe but slow enough so you can get a full hit) you don&#039;t have to pull hard, just long.... <br /><br />Keep in mind to heat enough (by controlling the lighters distance from the glass) to get continuous smoke..... but once you start seeing smoke you have reached DMT&#039;s vaping point and should try and &quot;keep&quot; that temperature.... <br /><br /><br /><br />--I personally cant advise you on SR&#039;s DMT much other than the stuff i smoke i made using &quot;BuddhaNature&#039;s DMT tek&quot; (R.I.P) which can be found here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35649.0<br />But any freebase dmt should work....<br /><br /><br />hazed<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
