				Would you go to a Ford dealership to ask its customers about a Chevy salesman?<br /><br />No.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking rude and offensive to the members of this forum to ask that question and mention that piece of shit flea market.<br /><br />And as I said, no one here has any experience with &quot;Symatec&quot; because he doesn&#039;t sell to us.
