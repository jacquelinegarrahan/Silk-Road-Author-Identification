				I&#039;ve been in my home for more than 5 years and I still receive mail for the deceased, previous owners. Would it be a wise move to use their names for SR orders to my home?

				If you&#039;re still getting mail for the guy you could, I guess. <br /><br />I think it all depends on what you intend purchasing, where it will be shipped from and how severe the penalties are in your local jurisdiction. <br /><br />For instance, if you were in Australia and you were to receive a small quantity of just about anything from a local vendor, then - so long as the address you receive the goodies at isn&#039;t a bust waiting to happen - then you could probably get away with using any name including your own. <br /><br />If, however, you were receiving anything from overseas, the simple fact that you would be effectively &quot;importing&quot; increases the potential penalties and thus, the risk. <br /><br />It is always preferable to be safe.
