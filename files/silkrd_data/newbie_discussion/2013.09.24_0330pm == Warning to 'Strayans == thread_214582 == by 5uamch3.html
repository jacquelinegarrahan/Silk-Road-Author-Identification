				---WARNING---<br /><br />Express to OZ order... no dramas, <br /><br />Package has CLEARLY been tampered with.<br />---THIS IS NOT THE VENDORS DOING--- <br /><br />The product is also tampered with.<br />Weight: slightly over ordered quantity.<br />50% decent.. looks legit...other 50% is cuts (ie. crushed so fine - ran it thru a kitchen sieve to separate) - crush is bunk (tested)<br /><br />The Postage label (sticker) had been sliced, a replica of the label had been printed and sticky taped over the top...<br /><br />Inside:<br /><br />-not what I&#039;ve come to expect from international vendors.. (trying not to give anything away here)<br /><br />But inside:<br />-no mylar.....<br />-a greeting card... ---------IT HAS AUS$ / NZ$ PRICE ON BACK!---------- - seems odd..... it came from Overseas.. :-S<br />-The &quot;stealth&quot; would NOT have passed customs inspection.&nbsp; ie.- there was none.<br />-however, product WAS vacuum sealed<br /><br />Bout 10am - &quot;delivered&quot; (tracking)<br />No doorbell or knock... (was on door watch)<br />It was carded (in mailbox - not visible from house) - card said collect after 3.30pm at PO.<br /><br />Collected after 3:30pm...<br /><br />Somewhere in the time it cleared customs and accepting it at 3.30pm, something went down...<br /><br />Looks like an organised operation.....? but FUCK... why bother?! <br />Plus; how did they know it would contain anything? (Although I recon I could have a pretty decent lucky dip with success....)<br /><br />Somebody is:<br />selecting, opening, inspecting, thieving - (only half?) replace with cuts, scanning replica label and printing, sticky taping fake label over sliced label.. repacking.... then getting it back to PO by 3.30pm....... ??<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Well why wouldn&#039;t they just take it all and just give you an empty box or something?<br /><br />Why go to all that effort to cut it and revac seal it?

				If the postman wanted your drugs he would just keep it. It is not as though you are going to report him.<br /><br />More likely it was tampered with by someone who knows you order these things, or that is just how the vendor sent it.<br /><br />Talk with the vendor.<br /><br />Your theory sounds so unlikely.

Accusations have been made - Although, the person in question is denying and was covertly tailed all day.... (he is the only one bar tail who know)...<br />he didn&#039;t have access to the tracking.... So he had VERY little warning. Then he would have to source and fabricate: cards, imitation labels, bunk product, vacuum sealer, tape, printer, scanner.... plus motivation; of which he has very little......<br />(Bear in mind he had not seen package style before.... )<br /><br />I&#039;ve giving the vendor the full story.. see what comes of it<br /><br /><br />Doesn&#039;t seem possible....
