				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if I can use PrivNote as a substitute for the PGP system. <br /><br />I find PrivNote A LOT easier to use.<br /><br />Cheers

				I don&#039;t know anything about priv notes. Something about notes that destroy themselves after they&#039;re read? I wouldn&#039;t be too sure they&#039;d be completely gone, though. Even if they were perfect, you&#039;d have to get your potential dealers to trust it as well.<br /><br />PGP is secure as they come though. It&#039;s RSA encryption which is essentially what online banking uses.

				There is a huge difference.<br /><br />PGP is the technology for encryption.<br /><br />PrivNote is a website that attempts to make that PGP encryption easier for the user.<br /><br />The difference is that when you use PGP you are responsible for all the data because you keep the PRIVATE KEY.<br /><br />When you use PrivNote, they keep the PRIVATE KEY, so they can decrypt your data.&nbsp; You must trust PrivNote, a third party.&nbsp; You must trust that they do not abuse their access to the private key and you must trust that they are in fact deleting your messages after they are read.&nbsp; There is no way to know if they are doing this.&nbsp; There is no way to know that PrivNote isn&#039;t a honeypot setup by the NSA for the sole purpose to read messages that are thought to be encrypted.<br /><br />The difference is where the private key is stored, PGP it is stored on your computer and you are in control.&nbsp; PGP is a much much better solution if you actually care about your data.

				I looked into the privnote side, but once you get your head around PGP it really is so simple.

				Difference between Privnote and PGP is night and day. MANY ways to compromise Privnote, very difficult to compromise PGP, not impossible but very very difficult. That&#039;s why it called Pretty Good Privacy and not Perfectly Good Privacy (can&#039;t take credit for that last statement, I read it somewhere else on a forum).

				Privnote has been proven multiple time to be unsecure. You&#039;re safer trusting the SR message system than privnote. BE smart. PGP or get the hell out of SR...nore heat here is not needed. Just like dumbasses who cant be bothered to educate themselves. It hurts everyone in the community when you get bested ya know.
