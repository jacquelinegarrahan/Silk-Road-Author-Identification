				Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m really new here, this is my first post. I&#039;ve mostly just been browsing the SR to see what it is like, then the forums to see what the people are like behind those delicious images.<br /><br />First, I would like to share my feelings about it all: After reading DPR&#039;s chat post, it struck a chord within me. This person hit the nail on the head regarding so much of what is wrong with our societies; governments demanding control and taking our money to pay for bullshit such as wars and paying off corporations. If they were to fully fund important things like education and health care before anything else we would all be so much better off! Screw the bastards pocketing our hard earned money, AND THEN telling us how we can and can&#039;t have fun! Our system is in desperate need of overhaul. Change must be forced upon those in power. This type of a system, whether used for legal or illegal, has the potential to instigate that change by creating a truly free market where supply and demand rule and the only law is to not bring harm to others.<br /><br />Second: By reading people&#039;s posts during the system outages and just seeing the general response and support, I think this all has a very sound chance of succeeding! This group of folks have loyalty and honor, tied in with honesty and openness (although complete anonymity). Even though the majority of sales is for drugs, I would love to see expansion in the market to create a more legitimate place; anything and everything. Make this a true anonymous Amazon.com deal, but with drugs too :)<br /><br />My experience so far has opened my eyes to how amazing it would be to revolutionize commerce and take the power out of the hands of the few, redistributing it to anyone that feels like participating!<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to making a purchase of any nature, legitimate or otherwise.<br /><br />Keep up to good work and lets change this world!<br /><br />-Tastylures

				I wonder if DPR specifically doesn&#039;t release the details about what is going on/if it is known who is initiating these attacks. It&#039;d be nice to have some sort of resolution to all the speculation!

				I&#039;m only a newcomer around SR myself, at least as a participant - I&#039;ve visited here or there in the past but my personal availability of privacy and freedom was at a low (but she&#039;s gone.. ^.^) and now I&#039;m finally entering what I&#039;ve wanted to be a part of for a while now.<br /><br />As for the point on why some of what is going on isn&#039;t necessarily said... its not always easy to really be able to say what truly is going on. On the surface, a DDoS is a broad statement... it really could be just about anything, from anyone - a competing market, LE (law enforcement), or otherwise. Stating who, or what it is, isn&#039;t always possible - and to say that it is or isn&#039;t (and then be wrong) can also be something of a demoralizing situation. That information is in the power of the admin to be told or withheld, and personally when I&#039;ve had to deal with it IRL I tend to lay on the side of information that I see available here regarding it. Keeping people informed, without having to divulge information that honestly I usually didn&#039;t even know myself, when battling similar events. The internet in its current state doesn&#039;t make it hard for someone to &quot;become&quot; someone else, and push blame to another group.<br /><br />I feel the important thing is that the presence IS there, and that they make themselves known that we are here to fight. We know when something is going on, and we know when progress is being made... or when it isn&#039;t. The struggles are not after-thought press releases... and that is not an easy thing to maintain.

				offbeatadam - Absolutely. Anyone can say anything which I am sure is why there is so much speculation that went into that fiasco. I had my doubts about the viability of this whole community. I figure with the money, time, and LE heat, there just isn&#039;t much of a chance something like this can prevail. Until I read DPR&#039;s post titled &quot;chat&quot; wherein my view on what this was actually about spun around. It&#039;s not about drugs, or money. Although those are two fantastic benefits. This whole thing is really just a big crowd of middle fingers to the governments and politicians of the world who want nothing more than control and absolute power. Exactly how I stand in life. That was a refreshing thought, that someone out there had a vision and put it into play, utilizing the very economics that drive our world wide systems of power and greed. And although those instances do still happen here, those people are cast out as dead-beats, shamed, instead of being thrust into the very positions of power that offer them the chance to carry out their tasks.<br /><br />As for being a libertarian, I could see that being quite a plausible fact. Although I do not affiliate myself with any political view, I simply want everyone to be able to make their own decisions based on morality and kindness. I guess I assume that most people will make the right choice when they know that others will as well and this can be ensured by freedom of choice as well as communal acceptance of what is right, not through force and fear mongering. Murder, betrayal, ignorance, gluttony, sloth. I&#039;m not religious either, but there&#039;s something to be said for the &quot;seven deadly sins.&quot; Treat others as you would like to be treated.<br />
