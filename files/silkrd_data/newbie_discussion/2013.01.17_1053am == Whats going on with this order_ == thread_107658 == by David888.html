				So i made an order with a new vendor called OZPharm. I made the order almost a week ago. After a few days my order was still processing so I ask him what&#039;s up, he says he just moved house and forgot a vital computer cable and can&#039;t decrypt my pgp address but if I want to send it as plain then he will send immediately. Anyways I send him the address using privnote (I know its not secure) and then a day later he says his javascript was disabled and to resend privnote again. I resend using privnote and then don&#039;t hear anything for the next 48hrs, order is still &quot;processing&quot;. So far he only has 5 or something feedback but its all 100%. He&#039;s not trying to scam me coz I dont have the option to FE since he&#039;s a new vendor but im just thinking WTF

				Hmmm... Order still processing , I would cancel and find another vendor however there is no other vendor that ships this product domestically and Im not prepared to order international. My money is safe as I can still cancel anytime assuming there is no time limit on the order &quot;processing&quot;. I will give him a couple more days then give up
