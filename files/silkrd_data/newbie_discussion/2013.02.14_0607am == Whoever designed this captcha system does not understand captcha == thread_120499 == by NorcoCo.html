				After typing 50 posts I realized this entire captcha system is broken.<br /><br />Each letter is a separate image and there are only a couple variations of each letter - that is EPIC FAIL<br /><br />This captcha can easily be broken by a mediocre programmer without any human assistance.<br /><br />How embarrassing. <br /><br />If you are going to use captcha at least understand how it&#039;s supposed to work. All this is doing is annoying people, it is not stopping bots.

				Oh I think the programmers here are not stupid at all.<br />As soon as someone has set up a bot to analyze this captcha, SR will spit out a new different style of captchas.<br />Bot kiddies will soon get get tired because they invest a lot of work for nothing.<br />

The current system wouldn&#039;t likely need a custom OCR module either.
