				How busy the blockchain is on any given day,Ive waited up to 4 hours...in the past.<br />Buying btc from vendors is alot faster. The BTCS come from the source you will be spending them.

				It can take up to 24 hours apparently, depends on how busy a day it is for the blockchain servers I think.

				Yeah, there are some serious delays happening right now.&nbsp; Best thing to do is hang in there, be patient, and know that you WILL receive your coins.

				Go to blockchain.info and type in your SR address (I&#039;d recommend doing this in TOR.) When it gets between 6-10 confirmations, it&#039;ll be in your account.

				Really hope its a temp problem... haven&#039;t had this issue before.<br />I know I&#039;ve seen people here on the forums having issues getting BTC *out* of SR.<br />I&#039;m on the opposite - wanting to push BTC in...<br />I clearly see the transaction - just not confirming.<br />Weird :/<br />
