				So obviously the 50 posts idea isn&#039;t working out. I came up with two different ideas after thinking for a few minutes -<br /><br />1. Require new accounts to wait a set amount of time like 3 days before being allowed to post. I&#039;m sure that they&#039;d forget their own login unless they&#039;re THAT hellbent on spamming and decided to wait it out.<br /><br />2. I&#039;m not sure if this is possible, but somehow block all new threads/posts that contain any variation of the website name being spammed I.e. virwex<br /><br />Let me know what you think<br /><br />

				I think they should make a change to the CAPTCHA so that it is a question/answer rather than typing letters, as the bot&#039;s OCR is able to read the characters produced by SR&#039;s CAPTCHA system. Questions could include &quot;5 + 2 = ?&quot; and &quot;Who is the President of the United States?&quot;, this would mean that the bot would need some degree of intelligence to be able to answer.

				If it was a 3-5 day wait. The spammers would just make a LOT of accounts every day and use them as soon as that time is up. Can&#039;t be hard to write them down.

				maybe the 50 post thing isn&#039;t such a bad idea. I am fed up of spammers and 50 posts isn&#039;t that much. Just a bit of a PITA.
