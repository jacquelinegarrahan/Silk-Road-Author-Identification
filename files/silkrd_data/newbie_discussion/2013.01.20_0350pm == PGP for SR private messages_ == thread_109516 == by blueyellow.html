				Title: <strong>PGP for SR private messages?</strong><br />

				Hi, <br /><br />I placed an order with a vendor last night and whilst reading through the FAQ&#039;s thought it would be courteous to inform the vendor via private message that although I am a first time buyer I had followed all the proper procedures before placing my order.<br /><br />I realise that PGP should be used when sending a vendor your address or e-mailing them, but does this apply to sending them a private message through SR too?<br /><br />

				If your message does not contain any sensitive information that could be used against you, I would say the answer is no.<br />The fact that you are even aware about the importance of PGP is a good sign. A lot of buyers don&#039;t use PGP at all. Keep doing your research on the forums, minimize your risk as much as you can. If you are ordering small amounts, and if possible domestic, your risk is very low.

				I agree with the above post but it also varies from vendor to vendor, some will delete the message if not encrypted.<br />It&#039;s best to keep all information that is incriminating&nbsp; encrypted.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

I don&#039;t bother with pgp for messages, but I might start. Lazyitis I guess. Didn&#039;t know that some vendors delete non encrypts. Thanks for that.

				Some vendors will want PGP for everything- others just want it used for shipping addresses. Be sure to check their profile!

				As for me, using gpg for all SR conversations is quite a good manner. It&#039;s not difficult, but can sufficiently decrease the paranoia level.
