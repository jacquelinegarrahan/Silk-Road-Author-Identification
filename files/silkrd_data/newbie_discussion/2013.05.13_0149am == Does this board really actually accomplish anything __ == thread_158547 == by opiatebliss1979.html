				I think they made the newbie forum to control the flow of new accounts into the main forums.&nbsp; Anyway if you have a vendor complaint I&#039;ve read that you can just put it directly in the newbie forum under it&#039;s own thread and it is just as effective.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally read many helpful reviews of vendors that came from the newbie forum using the search feature.&nbsp; Hope this helps a little.

( I know, because I have made a few other accounts on here, just to keep LE from following my posts. Best not to let them develop a &#039;profile&#039; on you, if you know what I mean. <br /><br />That being said. Feel free to PM me, and I&#039;ll gladly relay your message to whatever board you want, letting them know your forum name of course. <br /><br />I was like you. A &#039;non-forum&#039; type of guy. Then the Silk Road went down. - And I don&#039;t mean the past few weeks, that was NOTHING!<br />I&#039;m talking the 1st few WEEKS of November. - Some didn&#039;t see a Silk Road login screen for over a week! - Very few in fact saw one any earlier than that. <br /><br />So the only place to turn for information was these forums, and I made quite a few good acquaintances, and friends. As well as found great connections to the things I was seeking, that I otherwise wouldn&#039;t have know about. <br /><br />Everything happens for a reason. <br /><br />I hope you become more comfortable on here, as I did. <br /><br />Obviously you care enough to have come on to report the bad vendor. - That&#039;s what this is all about! <br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be &quot;Mr Social Butterfly-Forum Man&quot; - But give these pages a shot. You won&#039;t be sorry, trust me. - I never liked forums of any kind,<br /><br />I&#039;d given up on Facebook and all that other social media crap. - This is the one place I go to now for information, and to &quot;give back&quot; to this community, in the form of &quot;warnings&quot; like you&#039;re doing, and Reviews of Vendors. <br /><br />Feedback on a profile can be faked, made up etc. - They can&#039;t do that so easily on forums. - It&#039;s the one single thing that keeps the Vendors honest!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				It deprives people of good coke :(!<br /><br />I sent some samples early last year on the Road and then took a hiatus because I didn&#039;t know of a good way to convert bitcoins to Cash. Now I do, so I decided to reopen my account but I&#039;m stuck in Newbie Jail ;).
