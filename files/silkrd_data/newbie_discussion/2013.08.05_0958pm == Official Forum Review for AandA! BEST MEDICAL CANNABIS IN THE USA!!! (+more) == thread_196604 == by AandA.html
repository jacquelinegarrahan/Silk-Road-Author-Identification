				Title: <strong>AandA FLO STRAIN REVIEW 1g</strong><br />

				This is a strain review for AandA&#039;s FLO Strain which he is currently out of stock. I have to say it is the most highest quality weed ive ever ordered and the nugs were full and not popcorn, and aswell properly cured to perfection! Now lets get to the reviews.<br /><br />Purchase Info:<br /><br /><br />Strain Name: FLO<br />Amount Ordered: 1g<br />Price: ฿0.14-฿0.15<br />Postage Price:฿0.0764<br />Speed: 2 Days<br /><br />Strain Review-<br /><br />Look: 4/5- On the ad, the strain shown looked more purple, but I got a greener batch. THC Crystals dominate this strain as if they were sugar coated. Very Light Green with many red hairs. Very clean and Beautiful.<br /><br />Smell: 5/5- The smell has a strong fruity snowcone syrup smell to it, lol, with undertone of dankness. When lit up, tasted sweet, and smelled like fruity playdough.<br /><br />Effects: 5/5- I hit up a bowl of this with just a little amount and have got to say, a total Indica feeling, but the Sativa effects were there in my head, I was sleepy and lazy, but fully focused and awake at the same time. I came down with a total blanket of sleepiness.<br /><br />Potency: 5/5- 2+ Hours<br /><br />Overall: 20|25<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the good weed AandA, I will be coming back for a third time soon! :)<br /><br /><br />For Pictures look on MedicalMarijuanaReviews.com

				SR no longer gave me the option to leave feedback in the regular/old way, so I&#039;m leaving it here:<br /><br />First of all the packaging was especially good because it came in a form that doesn&#039;t resemble most of the other weed packaging I&#039;ve seen on the Road. It had all the necessary stealth features you&#039;d imagine needing though. Can&#039;t really say any more...<br /><br />The weed is really good (I ordered the Sativa, the Island Sweet Skunk). I have a substantial tolerance for hash oil (I&#039;ve been smoking mostly Indica oil lately) and in some ways I think this weed has a better high than the oil, more potent and energetic, though I prefer Sativas usually in general.<br /><br />The composition is perfect, as far as dryness, burnability and freshness.
