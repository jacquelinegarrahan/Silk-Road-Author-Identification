The name BANANARUSSA (Russian banana) came from the fact that our first server was in Russia. So we just kept the name and the &quot;tradition&quot; of the name. We can&#039;t really tell you the location of the servers for security measures.<br />About the second question: You CAN&#039;T be sure! As any other internet service or anything related to the internet, you can&#039;t be sure of anything! I&#039;m offering a service to replace the &quot;hole&quot; that TorMail left. We took our precautions, we hosted it in three different country, we encrypted the message that our users exchange, we encrypted the communication between the accounts and the &quot;send/receive protocol&quot;. Beside that, our users are encouraged to use PGP whenever they think is necessary.

That is why there are good people in deep web which makes life easier, they provide secret email service which you couldn&#039;t find in public network (simply searching through google), and these email providers will do everything to keep Your data private (read post above, the one with the FBI mentioned)...so to keep totally privacy in email contacting, You can you (and You should use) GPA (or PGP, I am talking about the same thing). You have to learn how to encrypt Your message with GPA (it is pretty simple)...when You encrypt Your message with GPA, You can be sure that no one else will read it, except You and the person in Your list, the person You have sent the message...If You need help in using this encryption, write back, we will help You step by step

				It is only MHO, but I would not consider ANY email service to be secure and anonymous these days, regardless of the supposed identity and intent of those running it. You have no idea who owns the data and what they intend to do with it, do you? Recent revelations have shown that security agencies are going to great lengths to break even personal encryption like PGP and I think it would be wise to assume nothing and take extreme measures. As long as your sensitive data is on some physical media somewhere in some format that may be readable someday you are not truly safe or anonymous :( Sorry to be such a downer but the assumptions many of us have made in the past cannot be relied upon. Maybe being as non-specific and vague as possible in your communications is the best option? Try to come up with language that, even if read, could not be construed as incriminating in a court?
