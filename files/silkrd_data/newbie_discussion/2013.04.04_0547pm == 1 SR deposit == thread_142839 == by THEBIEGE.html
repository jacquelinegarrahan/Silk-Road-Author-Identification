				Can take up to a few hours. Don&#039;t worry so much, if you&#039;ve done everything right you&#039;ll see the confirmations come through in a little bit.

				I made a deposit via Bitinstant over 2 hours ago to my bitcoin address and still nothing.<br /><br />I got this reply from Bitinstant customer support:<br /><br />I apologize for the delay. Due to an API issue on the Mt.Gox exchange, there are delays funding and processing to Mt.Gox/Bitcoin purchasing exchange that has caused orders to get ‘stuck’ in our system. Rest assured, your funds are safe and your transaction has already been re-queued. Your order will process in the next couple of hours as soon as we have the appropriate balance. Thanks so much for your patience.<br />

				Instead of MTGOX and Bitinstant, Try looking into Bitfloor and LocalTill.<br /><br />I use Bitfloor/Localtill to buy and Mtgox to sell. Bitinstant has been going downhill and I no longer trust them. They were great in the beginning but since they were robbed I&#039;m not so sure they are the optimal way to go anymore. Just my opinion..

				since i&#039;m about to make my first deposit soon ill ask my question in this thread! <br /><br />I just read through the silk road wiki to gain more information about bitcoins, but some things are still unclear. I guess every bitcoin-address looks the same (even the ones from legal websites) and therefore its not possible to see where my bitcoin-address leads to when i give it to a bitcoin trader. so the bitcoin-trader does not know that he is sending my bought bitcoins to silkroad. and the only way to find out that my bitcoin-address is the one from silkroad is to look into my silkroad account, am i right?<br /><br />and can someone recommend me a good/fast/safe bitcoin-trader for the EU?

				If you haven&#039;t received your coins in 24 hours, send a message to SR Support on the main site.

				FINALLY!<br /><br />At exactly 6 hours after I paid ZIPZAP at Walmart, my coins magically appeared in my SR account! I&#039;m so happy! Now to spend them before they devalue! I bought at $136 each and now they are $132!<br /><br />P.S.- Hello SCOUT! I want to thank you for posting that link to ASTOR&#039;s tutorial on GPG4USB. It is awesome and I was encoding my address in 2 minutes!

				Now can anyone tell me how often vendors change their prices to reflect the ever-changing BTC prices? I would think they&#039;d be slow to change as long as the BTC value keeps increasing.
