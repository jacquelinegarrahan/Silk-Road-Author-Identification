				So far what i&#039;ve learned there is Human&#039;s life and Life as all other forms and whole concept. People just being a part of it, just most reliable life-form on EARTH in only measurable by size Solar System wich is just a tiny peace of universe.<br /><br />Depends on how wide your perception is.<br /><br />We are humans, we need other people in a form of friends and family - just like this simple. And that&#039;s only REAL pleasure after all my friends.

				The meaning of life is all about learning to know the Source of Life, where life itself comes from.<br /><br />Obviously there is a Genius behind it.<br /><br />And just as obviously, there is great confusion as to what and how this being is.<br /><br />Still, I claim that the Source of life is Good, only Good.<br /><br />Even though life itself is often bad, sick, crazy and mad as hell.<br /><br />Apparently life in this world is composed of both good and bad.<br /><br />So the meaning of life is to find out how the Source of life can be perfectly good, while our experience here and now has parts of both good and bad.

				You are looking for &quot;reason&quot; where there is none. There are the mechanics of HOW. Abiogenesis. Evolution. Physics. Chemistry.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the WHY is something humans put onto nature because man is a creator. There can only be reason if there is intent. There is no evidence of intention. At best we might say &quot;evolution&quot;, i.e. to pass your genes on, to procreate. But even so, part of evolution is organisms *not* procreating.<br />

				There is no inherent &quot;meaning of life&quot;, i.e. it doesn&#039;t have a core value, or message to deliver. After all, life could be a sperm whale, Hitler, or algae.<br /><br />But as reasoning beings, surely (and I quote this as an atheist) &quot;do unto others as you would have them do to you&quot;, is a pretty good rule to live our hominid life by?
