				&nbsp;8) As we Newbies are unable to take part in the discussion going on regarding the recent attach on the SR, our Ship&#039;s Captain The Dread Pirate Roberts, his blessed Colleagues,&nbsp; and his long awaited Charter; I would like to publicly display how appreciative and in support I and others like me (too new to the crew to speak out on other forums), are in the human rights struggle taking place on this battleground we call the Silk Road! This old hippie is now a grand-dad, and lived for many years on a large lake located in the South, where many youngsters spent a lot of time swimming, fishing, boating and playing. We have survived very well for many years using one Golden Rule, stated so simply that anyone could understand it, and it was difficult to argue: BE NICE. Our transparency here on the SR makes this not only possible, but practical as well. It is the best way to do business, live your life, develop yourself as a human being! Why do we need the SR? To restore sanity and order, for one! I haven&#039;t drank alcohol for over 21years now (I&#039;m allergic to it, I break out in handcuffs, break out teeth, windows etc...), but I can drive right down the street and buy, what is to me poison. Had my connections over the years, but now they are (literally) dying off, getting too old to drive at night or for long distances, so my supply had just dried up! Man! I bet a lot of you can imagine my delight when I first logged in to the SR and saw what I saw - like a kid in a toy store! Man, if money weren&#039;t so tight on my fixed budget and raising 5 &amp; 6 year old grand-kids, I&#039;d try some of every bud out there! Thought about moving to Colorado or Washington, but just couldn&#039;t hack it! Now - I will fight for the SR! Keep your fucking hands &amp; minds off of my freedom to travel the SR! Thanks to the brilliant Pirate Roberts and colleagues, our traders and vendors and all fellow travelers! Long live the SR!

				I&#039;d like to officially second Dr. Pappy&#039;s post regarding the appreciation of the &quot;newbies&quot; for DPR &amp; Co.&#039;s tireless efforts to pilot this ship through the storm.&nbsp; And, as the struggle for true freedom and human rights perseveres in spite of government oppression, propaganda, misinformation, and outright lies in order to control the masses, I hereby second the SR Charter!<br /><br />DPR, in the immortal words of Brett Michael&#039;s &amp; Poison, &quot;Here&#039;s To &#039;Ya!&quot;<br /><br /><br />-Rogue3<br /><br />&quot;The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in times of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy.&quot; - Martin Luther King, Jr.

				Well said. We noobs need to work on educating ourselves and making SR stronger. The system is not perfect but it&#039;s as good as it gets. There are still&nbsp; scammers among vendors, but they are in a minority. Do your research and only deal with reasonable people.. <br /><br />Let&#039;s weed out the few scammers left out there. They prey on newbies so watch out and be diligent. A few bad apples are giving bad name to so many decent vendors. Be on the watch. I am.

				&nbsp;8) Arrrgh! Arrrgh! to dagerms &amp; Havok78 &amp; babyshiva999!&nbsp; !Viva SR &amp; DPR! Great point babyshiva999! Praise the good and report the bad! The $500. escrow account required by DPR should help (I&#039;d like to vend a bit, have some very good, high-demand pain med available, but have got to get serious about it before I put up the escrow to sell...) Encourage all travelers to do their due diligence!

				I can&#039;t believe we live in a world where the world&#039;s most notorious drug dealer is calls himself Dread Pirate Roberts and he&#039;s a regular folk hero.

				Ive seen a couple posts saying &quot;oh its just a drug webstite&quot; and i don&#039;t think that could be further from the truth given DPR&#039;s history.<br /><br />DPR has earned my respect and trust.&nbsp; When people talk about government or big business i often hear the phrase &quot;absolute power corrupts&quot; and that couldn&#039;t be further from the truth when it comes to DPR and SR staff.&nbsp; They have absolute power here, and they always act in the best interest of the community.<br /><br />DPR has made tons of money on the site, he earned every bitcent.&nbsp; This clearly isn&#039;t about money anymore to him.&nbsp; DPR is running the site to make a change in the world, and hes doing a great job!

				Great points about DPR. He&#039;s making money off the site of course, a man&#039;s gotta make a living. But in the grand scheme of things it goes much deep. It has an amazing potential to force powers that be to change the drug policies and repression and criminalizations of ordinary users.
