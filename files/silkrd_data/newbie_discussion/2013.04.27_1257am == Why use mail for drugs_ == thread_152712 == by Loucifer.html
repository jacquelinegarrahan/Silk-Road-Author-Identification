				Honestly why do you guys use the mail for drugs? Is it because you guys don&#039;t know anybody who sells the drug of your choice or what? I don&#039;t think I will be making any purchases anytime soon as I think i&#039;m getting a heart attack! Anybody know how many people got arrested on SR? I saw that some guys in Australia got convicted recently and another drug site was busted last April. Anybody have info on these arrest statistics?

				Unless you&#039;re ordering massive amounts, the absolute worse case scenario is a knock on the door, which you just play dumb about. If you&#039;re ordering mass amounts, then you should be smart enough to set up a few fail safes to ensure your ability to avoid detection. <br /><br />SR prices are cheaper, buying is safer, and the product is 100x better. I don&#039;t know any MDMA dealers in the US that can provide the quality I get shipped from overseas, or grams of amazing shrooms for dirt cheap that are twice if not three times as potent as local junk.

Local law is hard to enforce in the distance between my mailbox and the privacy of my home.<br />And why the mail? Because it works, and it&#039;s pretty cheap compared to the other options. As it has been said, just be prepared to play dumb and keep in mind that anybody can mail you anything, just never go out of your way to locate a package you were expecting.<br />I think you&#039;re much more likely to fall prey to a scam, or selective scammer, than to have a domestic package intercepted by the post office.

				The retard at the site that got taken down were giving their real credit card info out on a shit site that thought they could get by if they just limited member without using any real security precautions.<br /><br />I came here to begin with because a good friend of mine I didn&#039;t want to dissapoint asked for mushrooms. I asked EVERYWHERE. Tried the best I could. Then I was told about the silk road. The place has everything I can possibly imagine for prices I could never get on my own, for whenever I want it and probably with less risk than talking to some real strange people hoping they might have something I want. Tell me one place in a rural-to-suburban area that you can buy Ketamine by the stereoisomer by the gram. Friend of mine got bust for shrooms and the cops got nostalgic as they hadn&#039;t seen any shrooms since the 70s-80s in my part of the country. I know people who got shot at for trying to buy an ounce of shitty weed and the dealer decided he didn&#039;t trust him any more.<br /><br />The likelihood of drug dogs catching anything over the mail is negligible at best if you take some basic precautions and depending on what you&#039;re buying. When I first came here I asked why not use UPS or someplace not controlled by the government and faster and better? The response: the government is too incompetent and broke to look into any package that isn&#039;t insanely dodgy. UPS and the like actually do somewhat of a good job. I guess if I wanted to buy half a mill worth of drugs, maybe it&#039;d be best we worked out some sort of a drop-off point or something, but until then, you can rest assured that this is a good, safe option for purchasing drugs.

				&quot;Why use mail for drugs?&quot;<br />-----LOL why are you here?<br /><br />&quot;When I first came here I asked why not use UPS or someplace not controlled by the government and faster and better? The response: the government is too incompetent and broke to look into any package that isn&#039;t insanely dodgy. UPS and the like actually do somewhat of a good job.<br />-----That&#039;s not the only reason people don&#039;t use UPS. They don&#039;t use UPS because they can snoop on your packages. (I know you&#039;re not the one who said that, I just wanted to explain it from a different angle)<br /><br />In the US, they need probable cause to get a warrant to open your mail. Without a warrant, it&#039;s illegal here for anyone other than the addressee to open mail (without permission). Plus UPS is much more expensive.<br /><br />&quot;Anybody know how many people got arrested on SR?&quot;<br />I&#039;ve heard that it happened in Australia.<br /><br />&quot;another drug site was busted last April.&quot;<br />That was in 2011. It was The Farmer&#039;s Market. They got busted because they were using Western Union and other payment processors when they first started. They switched to btc later, but too late.<br /><br />They also weren&#039;t using PGP and were sending unencrypted emails through hushmail thinking that hushmail wouldn&#039;t turn over the emails to the feds. They were wrong.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;I don&#039;t think I will be making any purchases anytime soon as I think i&#039;m getting a heart attack!&quot;<br />-----I used to feel the same way too. Take many precautions, do lots of research, and, most important, trust no one.<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, here&#039;s a link to the Australian bust story:<br />http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/01/silk-road-crackdown<br /><br />And the Farmer&#039;s market bust:<br />https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/feds-bust-farmers-market-for-online-drug/232900406<br /><br />And the indictment:<br />http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/2012/045.html<br /><br />

				usps handles a huge amount of packages a day. They do no have the funds to check every single package they handle. It just makes sense to ship via mail.
