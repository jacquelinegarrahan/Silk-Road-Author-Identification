				What would the chances of getting caught be with domestic only orders for mephedrone or any substance and what would the chances be of 3 grams of mdma getting intercepted from the Netherlands to uk

				Get the mdma, it&#039;s infinitely better than meph. I haven&#039;t touched that stuff in years and have no desire to, go dutch it&#039;s worth the small amount of risk for a product that is 5000 times better than mephedrone!

				Thanks for the reply, I couldn&#039;t agree more about the mdma being better mephedrone has nearly ruined my health, neither products are for me at the moment though, mdma is for a friend I was going to order domestic today but the price jumped up a little and I found someone selling mdma for like 14 pounds a gram from Holland but he&#039;s a new vendor so going to keep an eye on the feedback for a bit before I jump in, if i don&#039;t buy from him though there&#039;s lots of other dutch vendors with cheap product and this will likely be the only time i order from another country was just wondering what the chances of it getting intercepted are.

				Just a bit of advice, I would order your stuff 1 at a time so if 1 does get intercepted you don&#039;t have a few others floating around in the mailing system and if you do get a few caught out it looks much worse than just 1. Just something I saw on here that would seem like common sense but I never thought of it when I first ordered.

				I haven&#039;t had a problem ordering from Netherlands. Just check out the vendors feedback and go for one that looks reliable.
