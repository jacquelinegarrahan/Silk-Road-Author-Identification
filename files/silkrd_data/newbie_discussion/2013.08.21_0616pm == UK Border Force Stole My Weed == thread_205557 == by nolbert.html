				Hi<br /><br />I have received a letter from Border Force today informing me that they have a quantity of cannabis which was imported from the Netherlands. I ordered it about six weeks ago and had assumed it was either customs/border force or a rogue postie, but it was still sad to have it confirmed. Has anyone else had the same problem and then resumed ordering from NL? How risky do people think ordering from NL is?<br />

				Generally the risk involved in ordering cannabis is usually limited to packaging quality, however if you want to be extra cautious check the percentages of imports to your country. The packages that will be least suspect are the ones from countries that regularly make their way to your destination

				Hey Man <br /><br />Sorry to hear that UK Border Force took your weed. In my own opinion it is risky ordering from different countries. Normally i only order form the UK Domestic Only.<br />I have never had a problem like that before. But remember it could of been the Stealth that give it away :(. Don&#039;t loose hope. Also i would be careful with ordering to your own address again as they might keep watch on your mail and stuff. <br /><br />Keep Strong and dont Lose Faith :D <br /><br />BrotherFox&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I had used the seller a couple of time before and the packaging had been very good. <br />Do you really think my address may be watched locally? I had thought it was probably not a good idea to import anything, at least for a few months, but didn&#039;t think a that few grams of weed would be enough to bother them too much.
