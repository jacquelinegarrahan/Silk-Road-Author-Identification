				I placed my first SR order last Wednesday. USPS express domestic. 1 gr coke. Today will technically be the 4th day and still no arrival. One wrong move I might have made (from listening to advice from another poster) is to misspell my first name a bit, like I was on a mass delivery sent out by a big company&#039;s computer. Don&#039;t know if that, along side being express, has raised suspicion, but I surely hope not.<br /><br />Since its my first order and I am a complete newbie still, my paranoia is kind of high right now (thinking all the worste case scenarios here, CD, etc..).<br /><br />Guess I am looking for words of wisdom from the more experienced members in this regard. Is over 4 days sketchy? Could the 1 letter misspelled in only my first name cause some suspicion?<br /><br />Feedback greatly appreciated. Thanks guys

				Ive asked the vendor to check the tracking on his end (thought vendors didnt like giving out tracking numbers) but that was on friday to which he said it was still &quot;in transit&quot;. <br /><br />Would it be within reason for me to ask for the tracking number now? Im really starting to get fed up here tbh...

				Would it be a big no no to try calling the postal facility to see if they had any missed express deliveries (in case postman forgot to leave pink slip)?

				Your Vendor Lied to you is what it sounds like. If you made a Order Last Wednesday an Friday he said its still in transit, something Is off, He didnt ship it when he said he did, which is not out of the Ordinary , Vendors lie. Not all do but allot . <br /><br />Like Jack said, you Paid for Overnight an have yet to get it, ITS OK TO ASK THE VENDOR FOR YOUR TRACK# Also you need to let him know that you wanna be refunded your money for express. Sounds like your getting jerked around. EXPRESS= 2DAYS Max. <br /><br />See what the vendors says now. If he doesnt wanna give you the traking tell him to copy an paste the updates from the tracking an give it to u. <br /><br />If you never receive, SAVE ALL THE PM&#039;S an see him in resolution.&nbsp;

				The vendor did eventually get back to me and said &quot;it seems it was lost in transit&quot;. He offered to re-ship and minus the charge for express or a give me a full refund. <br /><br />I messaged him back wanting a re-ship but I wanted it to go to a different address this time, in case there were complications in that regard. I informed him of this, but have not provided the new address yet as I wanted to get feedback from him on whether this might throw up some red flags.<br /><br />Does anyone think it would throw up red flags to have a re-ship to a different address? (assuming he is mailing again from the same location).
