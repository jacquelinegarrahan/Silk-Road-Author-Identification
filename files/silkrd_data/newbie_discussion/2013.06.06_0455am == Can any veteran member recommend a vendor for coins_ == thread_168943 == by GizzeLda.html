				It would be very helpful if an experienced and trusted member could direct me or some of us newbi&#039;s to a trusted and reliable vendor that can turn some cash into coin. Without having to put up 500 plus dollars.&nbsp; Thanks for any help,&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*&nbsp; :-* Love Love

				JumboMonkeyBisuit is of good repute. Don&#039;t think there&#039;s a minimum for cash. Takes 10%. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not a vet., however. <br /><br />

				Shit I pay for my btc at walmart through a moneygram with bit instant. I use a fake name on the paperwork and my store doesnt id. Gets directly deposited in my sr wallet. I think its pretty anon. But I also just made my first purchase yesterday and havent been around long enough to have heard any different. Idk. I almost didn&#039;t go through with sr but I felt comfortable after the transfer at walmart.

There are cameras where you deposit the money and it is most likely against the law to not use your real name (I assume). If you deposit the coins directly to SR, it also looks very suspicious due to the way the coins are handled once sent to your SR address.

I would think that they are not concerned so much with the small time individual buying a few coins every so often, but there most certainly will be a video of you by going to Wally World regardless.&nbsp; More importantly, is there an electronic trail from moving coins and are the coins labeled with an electronic Id?&nbsp; ???&nbsp;
