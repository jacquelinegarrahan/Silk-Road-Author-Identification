				Well it still appears to be up...<br /><br />DEA / FBI whatever are always on here anyway. Whether or not they have the forum server right now is unknown.<br /><br />Anything that is private info just make sure you use PGP (as always).

				It&#039;s as safe as it&#039;s always been. Which is about as safe as posting on a forum run by the feds. Everyone you&#039;re talking to is a fed. And always has been.

Chances are the forum is hosted somewhere else and is yet to be compromised, but take extra care, at all times.<br /><br />

				Who cares as long as your not posting anything illegal/incriminating. I think a better question is how safe is this new SM site that everyone is hopping over too. Sounds like a classic honeypot to me.
