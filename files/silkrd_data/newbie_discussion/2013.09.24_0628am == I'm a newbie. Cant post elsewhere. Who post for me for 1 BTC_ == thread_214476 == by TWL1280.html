				I need someone to post the following text in the forum&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Market » Product offers<br /><br />Headline; New SR Vendor offers free sample of Cocaine of extreme Quality - produced in Germany<br /><br />&nbsp;A new vendor has shown up at SR who claims that he is&nbsp; actually importing coca leaves instead of cocaine and refines the cocaine himself in a lab in Germany.<br /><br />The result is almost medically pure Cocaine HCL for an affordable price<br /><br />During the beginning, the vendor states that he will offer .5g and 1g as well as pulverized coca leaves (hard to get in Europe), from which one can make an excellent, stimulating tea.<br /><br />The vendor seems to use these small amount in order to build up a reputation and - once&nbsp; this is done - intends to move to larger amounts. Thereby, not only shipments from Germany will be offered, but also from their labs in South America.<br />&nbsp;While the prices from Germany remain high, the prices when ordering from South America will be around 25$ a gram (uninsured, i.e. FE and no refund) and around 45$ including full insurance (refund or reship).<br /><br />The vendor states that he aims to bring a product of extreme quality to the customer for a decent price. The Cocaine is always between 91% and 98% pure and has no other alcoloids<br /><br />Now at the beginning, the vendor offers free samples and reduced prices on all products. Products can already be ordered, but will not be shipped before Monday. However, the vendor uses full escrow.<br /><br />The vendor, however, warns about is product, as occasional users may overdose the to the extreme potency.<br /><br />For further information and free samples, please visit my vendor page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/366529fdc9<br /><br />IT&#039;S NOT AGAINST THE RULES AND I PAY 1 BTC IMMEDIATELY!!!!<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t call myself a &quot;lazy slob&quot;<br /><br />We have worked very hard on our product and on bringing it online. It is easy to judge.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t feel like making 50 random posts about topics I know jack about, just to be able to post in the vendor forum.
