				But I get anxiety when I think about giving a seller my info. I going to have to if I ever want to get anything from SR but dammit I live in the bible belt and the laws are what they are. With civil forfeiture always a possible thing I would be pissed to lose what little I have. So a quick few questions what are ways people do this receiving thing? Should I not worry and just take the dive? This is a big deal any other responsible home owners have a way they work around this? Should I just use someone else name, my address? Would that be good enough plausible deniability?&nbsp; To top it off all I want is some seeds to be able to supply myself and never worry about shady shit or being at the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp; So anyone have any ideas to due this with the least amount of exposure to myself?

				Are you concerned about the seller themselves having your address, or are you worried about cops/the government/the law?<br /><br />If it&#039;s the former, there&#039;s no reason to worry, there&#039;s nothing sellers can do with your name &amp; address that incriminates you without incriminating themselves. If you&#039;re worried about a seller being an undercover cop or something, then what many people fail to realize is that nobody&#039;s going out of their way to bust buyers on SR for possession.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not the seller themselves that you&#039;re concerned about, use PGP to encrypt your address... Something everybody should be doing no matter whatt they are or arent worried about.

				no dude, use the name that corresponds with the address your item is being sent to. It will be obvious something is wrong if someone named Jake is recieving a package at Tims house. understand?&nbsp; Your home address would give you 100% plausible deniabilty if your house was clean of illegal material and they didnt search your computer. When recieving a package at your house you should not have to sign for it. Most domestic sellers if not all of them do not require a signature. If by some chance you do have to sign for it do not open the package right away. Wait a day at least and after a few hrs write return to sender on the package. That way they dont catch you doing it right after youe sign for it. SR is secure just use a vendor who has credibility,learn PGP,it is very easy and if you dont know then search the forums. I ususally obtain my bitcoins with a moneygram cash deposit to bitinstant.com with a fake name. its really interesting learning about this site thru the forums and it gets even more interesting when you can get any drug you want. good luck&nbsp; and think before you act and all will be well.oh and you scared me with your title , i thought you commited suicide as well.

				Wow really sorry did not even cross my mind the title would be thought as a sign of suicide. It was more along the lines of you got to get feet wet before you jump in the water and swim. Being that I got my feet wet bought a couple none address needed items its time to decide if I want to swim. Maybe I&#039;m just over thinking things but shit I&#039;ve tried to think all sinerios out comes. When you have nothing to lose like being rich and able to afford fight with lawyers or poor without a pot to piss in you can say fuck it. In my case I&#039;m in the middle if I choose wrong ie the seller I&#039;ll be the one without the pot. I know people say not to worry and using encryption is good and all but all it takes is one domino to fall. Our big brother is a great destroyer of lives and he will chew you up and spit you out. Wham bam thank you ma&#039;am. See over thinking I just don&#039;t want end up on a list I&#039;m already probably on one being a vet with outspoken views of our government and guns with stock piles of ammo.

				IF domestic and you don&#039;t have to worry about anyone going threw your post like roommates and parents you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Use your own name and find tutorials on this forum on how to use transcript and plausible deniability

				I&#039;m not particularly worried.<br /><br />There is a really good reason the feds aren&#039;t interested in busting us. Its not worth the money. 500$ (at m minimum, or a lot of effort) to arrest some druggies? NOT worth it. This isn&#039;t even including the cost to send out a fed, and take the person to court.<br /><br />Think about it. If a fed bought an account, how long do you think it would be before people began reporting controlled deliveries, or reporting that they had been arrested? 1-3 before nobody wants to ever buy from that vendor? Perhaps just 1 purchase. Would you buy from a vendor with one or two reviews, both saying they got screwed? NO.<br /><br />Stop worrying. There are plenty of reasons SR in safer than people think at first glance.

				what he means is NEVER sign for anything you and the seller did not agree you would be signing on. FYI signing something you and the seller agreed youd sign is fine.
