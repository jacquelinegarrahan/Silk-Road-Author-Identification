				I doubt this will be read by the powers to be. However a little about myself I don&#039;t do drugs exception of modafinil around exam times. I really like the concept of the bitcoin and the concept of silkroad. Silkroads Vendor fee was put into place to protect it from tainted goods. However fake goods is exactly what I want to sell. And as this is the only product I&#039;m going to sell and I&#039;m going to sell cheap pretty much just want shipping + supplies price back until I&#039;m good enough that my product actually becomes demanded (if it becomes demanded I&#039;m not sure how many mtg players use silkroad lol). and thus would be too much of a risk financial risk to even start investing into a sellers account.<br /><br />http://share.pho.to/2Xbmo<br /><br />Here&#039;s a gallery of my very early stuff. I&#039;m looking at selling them at like 1 dollar each. I&#039;m investing into a higher quality printer and will be trying different paper and making these things by the bundles I hope. well fishing for reviews what do you guys think? Eventually I want to get to the point where people could probably pass them off as real. Should I just make my own website? or seek investors/charity. <br />

				That&#039;s a pretty awesome idea, if I played it&#039;s something I&#039;d be interested in for sure.
