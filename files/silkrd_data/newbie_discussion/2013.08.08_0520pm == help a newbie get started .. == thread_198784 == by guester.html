				not sure about the email thing. but yeah that PGP you have is fine. I delete the vendor keys after I use them. It&#039;s just as easy to load their keys again as you need them as it is to bring it up with kleopatra or whatever you use.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible and going through a VPN would add another layer of security, but you have to make sure the VPN client takes your anonymity VERY seriously. Most people will not go through the extra step to find a reputable VPN client, being as they are exceedingly difficult to find and feel that TOR works well enough for most purposes. <br /><br />It is perfectly legal to create a bitcoin wallet on any device with any operating system. I just use firefox and the clearnet when getting bitcoin. Nothing illegal with that.<br /><br />

Do not use safe-mail! I can&#039;t find anything on what is a good service to use, from what I have read, as long as you ENCRYPT EVERYTHING with PGP you will be fine and have little to worry about. So you can use safe-mail.net but you better encrypt every god damn thing and don&#039;t make your username something like &quot;ismokecrackdaily@safemail.net&quot; Be safe out there guys!<br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				SAFe-mail, as suggested above, is a fantastic service accessible via TOR.&nbsp; As with any email service, you are only as secure as your messages.&nbsp; The biggest advantage of SAFe-mail stems from it being hosted in Israel.&nbsp; You can bet that the Mossad monitors at least certain accounts, but by their very nature it is damn unlikely they share that info with any other governments.<br /><br />And if you use PGP, the only thing that matters is your ability to connect to the provider anonymously, and no blocks on tor exist nodes should be sufficient for that with SAFe-mail.
