				There&#039;s a special place in hell for scumbags like Sam ...... Yes I did an FE like lots of other people ....... his feedback was 98 plus with virtually no negative comments when I placed my order. I wasn&#039;t taken in by the extra 20 % .... I was simply looking for a quality vendor. My purchase / loss was minimal ($70) by comparison. NEVER EVER will I FE again. This should be a lesson to the entire community as to how quickly you can be taken even by those who appear to be legit. One thing I will never be able to figure out is why so many people continued doing an FE even with horrendous feedback staring them right in the face. I mean really.... what was the motivation, did they think one in five buyers were pulling the scam. It would be interesting to ear from someone who placed an FE with Sam in the last 3 - 5 days. Lessons learned people.

				Another reason it took a long time (other than the fact that the site was under heavy attack recently) is that SamGiancana had been banned before.&nbsp; When that happened, admins were sure that they were making the right decision, but he presented some kind of evidence that put it all into question, so his vendor status was reinstated.&nbsp; What that meant for this most recent banning is that admins had to be even more certain and find even more proof before they banned him again.<br /><br />Looks like they were right (like most of us thought!) the first time they banned that douche!

				If people don&#039;t read the forums, they weren&#039;t to know without checking feedback, he was top of the lists for stimulants, and they&#039;re listed in order of popularity. Someone said last week, that this is a shopping site like Amazon, and people don&#039;t check the Amazon forums, not everyone is into social networking. Some of us just want to buy drugs in a safe way with no hassle. We generally put our faith into presumptions a lot of the time, hey, he&#039;s top of the list, most popular crack. Also, drug users IRL aren&#039;t known for being trustworthy, so who do you believe if you look at some negative feedback? The vendor who spend $100&#039;s buying his vendor account, or a buyer/potential opportunist thief? I have only just started using the forums because of a few shared mix-ups from a vendor this last week. I now see them as invaluable research and communication tools. Good luck to all fellow travelers in finding, avoiding and reporting future scammers.&nbsp; Hope all deals go smoothly from now on. Peace

				I have to agree with the forums being an invaluable tool. But negative feedback is a huge red flag and near the end Sam had a ton of negative feedback. I know because some of it was mine and I was no lone ranger. I have a hard time feeling sorry for anyone who would do an FE with multiple people complaining of 1) No communication after FE ...2) Sam lying to his customers ......3) issuing bogus tracking numbers 4) claims of a hacker getting control of his account or ....5) ALL of the above.&nbsp; There comes a time and point where common sense should prevail. He wasn&#039;t the only swinging dick selling drugs on SR now was he ???? I can only hope he gets his in the end ...... as one poster said Karma is a bitch

				I was one of those who sits in the background and trolls the forums. Luckily I did cause I DIDNT finalise on a 100G order with the cocksucker.<br /><br />Decided to register an account and try spam to 50 yesterday. This whole spamming shit has really turned me off registering an account for a long while but now I understand everyones voices does need to be heard when it comes to vendors like this cunt.<br /><br />Now all my funds are tied up in the resolution center. I hope admins could just check every order placed with this guy and refund all moneys back. Over 3 weeks now arguing with him, him trying to push to FE etc etc now I just wanna place another order...<br /><br />This whole experience has nearly put me off this website completely however I know DPR is doing as much as possible with the current mods so I decide to stay loyal. Id hope in the future we could have a few more people who deal with the resolution center and a few more moderators on the forums would also help significantly IMO. <br /><br />This whole spam to 50 shit is just not the way to go, I think about all the people like me who just cannot voice their opinion cause they dont understand why they cant post in the major fourms...<br /><br />As I said to SamGiancana, some traditional tribesmen of my people will be casting black magic over him causing utter misery with the funds he stole off the noobs/unsuspecting innocent customers of this great site. I dont give a fuck if people do or dont believe in that shit but I know one thing, when he tries to return to get it removed - I wont be here for the dog to remove it!.<br /><br />Regards.

				Sucks for the ones who got burnt....<br /><br />I guess it would be wise for most to only deal with sellers for a short amount of time seeing as there really is no reporcussion for stealing and all you really have to do is build some good feedback reel in some buyers over time increase the amounts you move and one day bolt<br /><br />ESCROW ESCROW ESCROW<br /><br />

				Hi Joolz. thanks for the advice&nbsp; i learn a lot from your posts. in the future i will<br /><br />1) Check vendor for percentage.. Is it trsnding up or down.<br />2) is vendor trolling for people to Fe<br />3) is vendor offering more than what u r paying for ( i.e. 20% more), do people get what vendor promissed<br />4) is product being delivered per customer feedback<br />5) are there multiple Fes with no update that product has arrived<br />6) do a thorough search of forums on person i want to buy from<br />7) Stop being a dope fiend&nbsp; looking for cheapest price or in a hurry to get my product<br />8) finally&nbsp; &nbsp;NEVER NEVER MEVER FE AGAIN<br />.<br />CLPICARD

If that&#039;s so somebody has an address of yours (it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s not in your real name, some information will still be there, and certain &quot;things&quot; you cannot avoid, differently from people coming after you).<br /><br />If the vendor from whom SamGiancana ordered is around can he please contact me by PM giving me that info? Thanks.<br /><br />Let&#039;s see how you will smile if I receive this info (probably it will not happen, but luck comes and goes, you know).<br /><br />Never watched &quot;Bring me to hell&quot;? Movies sometimes are truer to reality than you can suppose... I don&#039;t usually lose time for imbeciles or for those which life pathetic, but you have even the courage of making irony? It will be time well spent.
