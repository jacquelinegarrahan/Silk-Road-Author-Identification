				<br />ive got a friend who will black out very easily.<br />he&#039;ll a weed cooky and waking after going to bed on my couch.screaming bout how he hurt me....<br />he always is immediately concerned if he hurt me or my partner.<br />he&#039;s never been violent.<br />just blacks out super fucking easy.im the only one in his life who can get him to do <br />anything because of his adverse reaction to anything.i&#039;ll give him some dmt and he&#039;ll come back<br />saying&quot;dude did you feel that,i know someone had to feel me do that.i hope there good and not bad.<br />i just pinged super hard.they had to feel me do that.i hope the government doesn&#039;t come.&quot;<br />i tell him i didn&#039;t feel anything.and that i dont know what he meant.<br />he eats some mushrooms at this cave with me and blacks out and starts talking bout how he killed a mountain lion.and how he&#039;s seen it a thousand times before.no mentioning the ping.<br />mushroom trips have been some of the most vaguely remebered expierences for me.<br />they shake me down deep.very overwhelming. it&#039;s hard coming back from that sector of psych space<br />with any useful&nbsp; information for me. at least with strong mush doses.small amount&#039;s are fun but when you eat 1/2 ounce , it turns into a very different thing<br />one thing that i know when i feel it i know im coming up real strong is looking down at my physical meat wagon and seeing my body shape changing.my arms get super long ,stretched out.<br />i find looking at my self in the mirror is pretty crazy.<br />it&#039;s always me and other peoples body&#039;s that trip me out .how we start to look different.<br />the sense of sound is also greatly warped.<br />tttttttttttttrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiippppppppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn<br />

				I get that whole body shutting down feeling. I can feel sections of my body just relaxing and they spread until they all converge. I just drift into a seriously deep mental and physical trance.<br />Peace

				Every proper shroom trip I have done (the only way to do Psilocybin is in strong doses IMO) involved a &quot;blackout&quot; period while out walking.&nbsp; You will be walking along, very much deep in thought and some period of time later (10mins, 30mins), you essentially &#039;awake&#039; to find yourself in a completely different area.&nbsp; Traveling at least a mile isn&#039;t uncommon.&nbsp; If that isn&#039;t part of the experience, you did not take enough mushrooms.

				When you think the entire building is going to melt any second and you think u can actually read people&#039;s minds whilst drawing pictures with eyes closed/open (doesn&#039;t matter both works when you take a great amount of shrooms like 5g+). I must say that you haven&#039;t truly tripped before in my eyes if u haven&#039;t taken 5g+ it&#039;s just so different (in a positive way though feels a lot more spiritual and less giggly/childish like 1.5-3g). I love psychedelics as they&#039;re so different from uppers/downers and they can change your whole mindset forever :).
