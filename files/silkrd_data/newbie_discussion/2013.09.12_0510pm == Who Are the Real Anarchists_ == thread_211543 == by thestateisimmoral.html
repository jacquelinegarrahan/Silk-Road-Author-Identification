				people who think that the world can run without rules ... we can fight against the established rules and try to change things. but not live without! because it will return the same. it will be the law of the jungle. the rules are dictated by a group composed of individuals devoid of social quality. anarchists are themselves victims of the system they buy like everyone else in the stores and they pay with the same currency, they have the same needs and the same desire that everyone etc. ... except most n &#039; have not the courage to get up in the morning to go to work and nourish their families. and who may want their children to a world that is harder than ours? these people have looked too MadMax ;). and I&#039;m sure most &quot;anarchist&quot; would cry as a children if the world were like this!<br /><br />anarchy for me is ultimately the same as the dictatorship!

				Anarchist? Someone that believes in a society without a state. One that believes in free association.<br /><br /><br /><br />littleitaly, please do some reading about anarchism. You&#039;re one of very many that has a poor, ignorant, interpretation of the word.

				well go there! launches you and change the world! :))<br /><br />he has not asked you the definition you&#039;ve read in the dictionary. but what do you think.<br /><br />You should also read the definition of utopia. and also learn to think for yourself.<br /><br />I knew very well the anarchist movement. I have an advanced age, and I thought, and tried many things in my life. it allows me to be so harsh in my words ... do not call me ignorant without knowing me.<br />your definition looks like junior Wikipedia. but I think you will change his mind over the years. anarchist is not a movement devoid of greed and benefactor my friend.<br /><br />it&#039;s like communism. it is good on paper, but the reality is different. (Such as capitalism)<br />

				anarchism is Silk Road!<br />anarchism is Bitcoin!<br />anarchism is NOT blowing up a library or shooting a school! <br />anarchism is me not having sex with a girl bcuz she doesnt have big titties!<br />anarchism is the dude that put a Silk Road how to guide on Amazon!<br />according to Websters: <br />:1)&nbsp; a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups<br />2)<br />:&nbsp; the advocacy or practice of anarchistic principles <br />

(Hey onetimething! SR or bitcoin ... there is nothing philosophical! Is a story of money, that&#039;s all!)<br />but it is better if the young still believe they can change the world and make it better. we need this rebellious spirit and I encourage it.<br /><br />but the major part of anarchists, not absolutely fit the definition you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />want more social, solidarity, love, pacifism, etc. ... is to be more human is to be a good person. but it is not inherent in the anarchist movement! be against all forms of authority, that is the true basis of anarchism. and that&#039;s completely unrealistic.<br /><br />I hate the police ... but how do you do without? you think it is enough to be an anarchist to remove all the bad side of human beings? no, of course!<br /><br />Since time immemorial, people line up behind the leaders. like wolves. humans are like that. single dominant can survive in an anarchist world since the followers are not protected by an authority ... and therefore, it is not anarchy. Do you understand?<br /><br />therefore believe that it is beautiful ... but completely unrealistic! and if you think it is possible then you&#039;re an anarchist ... but also a sacred dreamer!<br />
