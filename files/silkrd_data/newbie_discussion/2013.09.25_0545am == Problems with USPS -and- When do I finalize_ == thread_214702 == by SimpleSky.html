				Man, leave it up to the USPS to fuck shit up.<br />So, my order comes today. Express shipping paid for, and excited to get my order - instead of coming home to a box at my door, there&#039;s a fucking pink slip stuck right above my door-knob. No sig was required, nothing special about the package except that it was an express package.<br />Problem is, I get home much after the local USPS office closes, so now I&#039;ve lost both my time in waiting another day or two before they get around to re-delivery, but I&#039;ve lost money having paid for express shipping. What kind of a dumb fuck takes a package that doesn&#039;t require a signature? Fuck these ass wipes.<br />Next problem is - this is my first order ever. Do I finalize now that I know it&#039;s here? Is it fair to make the vender wait because a jackass mailman has his head up his ass and took matters into his own hands? I mean, to be fair, I haven&#039;t seen the product yet - I haven&#039;t sampled it - ya know?<br />Why would the mail(man|woman) do this? Who the fuck do they think they are? Don&#039;t they know they just wasted my time and money?<br />How do I handle this?<br />How do I prevent this from happening in the future?<br />Fuck fuck fuck - I&#039;m so pissed off - I want to catch that jackass in action and ream his/her stupid ass. Like - shouldn&#039;t that fucking click? IT&#039;S FUCKING NEXT DAY SHIPPING ... BECAUSE I WANT IT THE NEXT FUCKING DAY, YOU STUPID FUCK SHIT FACE ASS CUNT.<br />Jesus fucking christ man.<br />*rubs temples*<br />so ... yeah - a bit pissed here. Suggestions? Thoughts? Similar experiences?<br />Thanks all.

				You mad bro?<br /><br />JK, I wouldn&#039;t finalize till I have laid eyes on the goods myself.&nbsp; However you may have an issue because the mailman should have left it if it didn&#039;t require a sig.&nbsp; I would ask the vendor if there is a chance he forgot to check the &quot;waive signature&quot; box.&nbsp; My mailman always just leaves the package in my mailbox even if it is express as long as the sender waived the sig.

				i&#039;ve had this happen before. My theory is that since a majority of the packages that do go express mail do require a signature they are in autopilot mode. Once you didnt answer they just left the slip like they normally do. <br /><br /><br />Alternatively -- It also comes down to your shipping habbits. If you have numerous of those packages without sig your mailman will pick up and remember. Some postman do not leave packages publicly visible if you live in a shady area. <br /><br />but yea express mail retards -- theres a reason you paid a 300%&nbsp; premium<br /><br />Maybe tell your postman next time you see him/her&nbsp; that you give permission to leave packages that don&#039;t require signature and POLITELY inform them they cost you. Last thing you want is a nosey pissed off person delivering your shit.

				True true. I&#039;d thought about that. I&#039;d love to just ream them raw, but at the same time, I don&#039;t want - like you said - a nosey grumpy postal employee to be delivering my packages.

				Express is a waste of money.&nbsp; Half the time it takes 2 days anyways same as priority as long as its not going half way round the world.
