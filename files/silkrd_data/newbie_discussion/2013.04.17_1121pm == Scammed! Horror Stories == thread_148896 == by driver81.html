				I think that having a good horror story thread is vastly more useful than it might at first sound. There aren&#039;t any statistics on this but, based on what me and my friends have experienced, almost every consumer of illicit substances has been ripped off at least once. It&#039;s a right of passage in many ways, you get knocked back, but you come back stronger and better than ever. That&#039;s why Silk Road in particular appeals to me. The only time you get mugged off on here is if you don&#039;t use the site correctly (checking feedback, forum posts etc) or you got phished.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m just being long winded. STORY TIME CHILDREN!<br /><br />At the tender age of 14, I had an acquaintance a couple years older than me who had just began experimenting with cannabis, pre-ban mephedrone, ketamine and MDMA. I was obviously very keenly interested in what this guy had to offer, whenever I&#039;d had any such drugs in the past it was alcohol or very shitty weed. I began giving him money to buy weed and ketamine for me, in return he could pinch a bit off the top of whatever was in the bag. For some reason, he started taking a particular dislike to me, and I stopped buying from him and talking to him.<br /><br />A couple months later, he started speaking to me again, about how he had found this new dealer from a few miles away who could get &quot;anything&quot;. I trusted him, that was my mistake. I asked for the dealer&#039;s number and was given a mobile number. I have a good long conversation with this guy about what things he could get ahold of, prices and rates. We eventually agree that a few days later, I would buy the most I&#039;d ever spent on drugs.<br /><br />We arranged to meet at a half way point by train. I arrived at the meeting point, and got a text from the dealer saying that he didn&#039;t have time to get off his train as he had to be elsewhere by a certain time, and I would meet him at the door of the train and he&#039;d pass me the goods and be on his way. Alarm bells were ringing but I didn&#039;t listen, because I couldn&#039;t imagine that my mate would set me up. The train pulled in and standing at the door was a scruffy looking 20-something. He yelled my name and I shuffled over to him, passing him the cash. He pushed a weighty plastic bag at me and skulked off back into the train. I quickly left the platform to somewhere I could check out the package.<br /><br />It&#039;s contents were<br />-A weighty rock (supposed to be soap-bar hash - just realised now it&#039;s sat on the window sill opposite my desk)<br />-6 fruit pastilles (think he just put that in there to piss me off)<br />-A bag of crushed up paracetamol (meant to be ketamine)<br />-A jelly bean in a baggy (ecstasy pill apparently)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t quite realise how solidly I&#039;d been screwed over until I was nearly all the way home. Just that sickening feeling in your stomach. But that wasn&#039;t the worst. My begrudging older mate began to brag about how he&#039;d set me up and then spent all my money on drugs to his mates. Word spread, all I felt was shit, I wasn&#039;t even angry enough to face up to him and settle our differences. From then onwards I&#039;ve become so good at gauging whether a deal is genuine or not, and I&#039;ve saved a fair few people from getting screwed since then as a result.<br /><br />Damn, feels good to get that shit off my chest. Post some of your horror stories of being scammed while I roll myself a doobie.<br /><br />(P.S. Anyone who says you&#039;ve never been scammed: Fuck you!&nbsp; :P)

				I just got scammed for the first time the other day. Unfortunately it was pure stupidity on my part. In my rush to order things for 420 I failed to do research and made the rookie mistake of not hitting the forums first. Xq<br /><br />I finalized early for a new vendor after letting my greed get the best of me when he offered free product. It was EJDriect and while he only got me for 40 bucks It&#039;s still a piss off that I was so dumb.<br /><br />Moral of the story is never FE unless you already Havre a good relationship with vendor and make the personal choice to, and even then it should&#039;ve avoided.

				I saw an episode of a British fly on the wall police show on TV a while a go. They apprehended a shop-lifter, searched him and found what he said was heroin.<br /><br />When they later ran tests on him they found out that his &quot;heroin&quot; was a bit of dog biscuit in a wrap. Poor sucker, judge ordered him into drug rehab anyway.&nbsp; :-\

				FE&#039;d with Binxster a while back. First &amp; hopefully the last time getting scammed. As everyone always says: If it&#039;s too good to be true, it probably is.
