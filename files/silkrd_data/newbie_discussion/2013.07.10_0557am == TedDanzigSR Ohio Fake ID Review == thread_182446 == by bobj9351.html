				Ted makes it as easy as possible to order a fake. His website provides step by step instructions which makes it practically impossible to screw up your order. After I made my order, the id was made within two days and at my doorstep two days later. The stealth was perfect and there is no reason that any shipment from Ted will look suspicious. I have a friend with a real Ohio ID and when we had a bouncer look at them one after the other, he thought that my friends was the fake id. When you hold the ID in your hand it has the perfect weight and feel and bends perfectly. One issue that I have noticed on other fakes is severe orange peel on the laminate cover. On Ted&#039;s ID, the laminate has almost no orange peel and has the perfect amount of shine.&nbsp; Colors are reproduced accurately and everything looks crisp. I decoded the PDF417 barcode and my data was written correctly onto the bar code. The holograms are the best I have ever seen and the UV ink is high quality as well. The most impressive aspect of these ids are the two identification pictures. I sent Ted a zip folder with several photos and he picked the one that would work best for his editing process and I have to say that it looks like the photo was taken in an official government office. <br /><br />There is no point in spending $130 for a mediocre fake ID from other sources when for a little bit more you can receive a premium ID from Ted that will work in state and can fool bouncers and cashiers anywhere without risk of being taken. Not only that, but you get to interact with Ted who is extremely responsive to customer messages and requests. No other ID vendor can be trusted and relied on like Ted can. I have already recommended him to many people and I plan on being a repeat customer for the foreseeable future.
