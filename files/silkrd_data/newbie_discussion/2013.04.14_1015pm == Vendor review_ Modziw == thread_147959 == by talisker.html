				Since I am not active on the forums the new anti-spam system won&#039;t let me post in the main section, so I&#039;ll post here instead. <br /><br />Just wanted to let everyone know that Modziw is the man! He has been doing business during the whole bitcoin crisis with absolute professionalism. <br /><br />I placed a large roxy order with Mod during the crash and received my package 3 days later. He ended up taking a big loss on my transaction. He never complained about it, didn’t cancel the order, didn&#039;t ask me to FE, and still honored my transaction. What a great guy. I felt really bad though. I wish I had more bitcoins in my account to help him absorb some of the loss. <br /><br />I hope OXY vendors on SR don&#039;t get wiped out by the current bitcoin situation. I only have two favorite Oxy vendors on SR and I hope they both survive the bitcoin crisis.<br /><br />

I look at bitcoins as part of the SR experience and if you are not willing to lose sometimes you shouldn&#039;t play the game. After all, sometimes the exchange goes in my favor as well.<br /><br />I appreciate your business and I really appreciate you taking the time to write about your experiences with me.<br /><br />I hope we do a lot more business together!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />(:<br /><br />Modzi
