				PICTURES http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/47f.jpg<br /><br />Sorry about all that paper trash in the background, I can&#039;t find a table top that does not have any on it.<br /><br />Anyways, the package arrived like this expect it had a fucking envolope. I say the stealth is a 10/5<br /><br />The product: All I gotta say dude, thats actual 100% dog shit. What the fuck?<br /><br />Overall I paid $900 for a 1/8 pound of some dank shit. Even though thurgood went MIA for 4 weeks, he came thouogh, but not with the weed I ordered, but a pile of dog shit. Final scrore -200/10<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				Thurgood has the best green on SR and the best dogshit. It&#039;s a nice mellow high with a deep indica body buzz. Tastes like shit but damn... I will be back. Stealth could be better, right when I opened the first layer I smelled strong Fido-like odor. <br /><br />(I think the money is a threat to Thurgood. He is saying &quot;I will be ordering more dogshit from you soon and exposing the troof.&quot;)

				I don&#039;t know about anyone else but one of the first see things that i saw/heard/was told/ and read when coming to SR was NEVER FE!!! NOT TO ANYONE!!!&nbsp; because if you do you are on your own.&nbsp; If you got ripped off i&#039;m sorry,&nbsp; but don&#039;t come here expecting pity when every other post is someone warning not to FE.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you deserved to get (allegedly) ripped off.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying stop expecting people to feel sorry for you and come join your cause.&nbsp; I got ripped of for 250 dollars by trying to buy bitcoins with a moneypak when i first arrived here but i never complained because everyone told me i was going to get scammed with a moneypak.&nbsp; I realized i made a stupid mistake and ate the loss like a man.&nbsp; I made a single post warning people from the scammer and that was the end of it.&nbsp; Please stop making a mess on the boards by reposting this over and over.&nbsp; It&#039;s not necessary.

				Laughed pretty hard at this ;D<br />Why would you pay $900 and FE for 2oz. when 1 oz. listings from most other venders hardly EVER go above the $350 range? Pay an extra $200 for what exactly? If your trying to trash Thurgood you should at least claim prices that are somewhat realistic.

				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />Scammerhounddog/Dealerofdrugs/Coachella420/Infinitesource/boostintohyperspace/real scumbag is posting things like I sent him dogshit and lettuce and things like that. They&#039;re too poorly done to seem real, but if you&#039;re wondering here are all the messages he&#039;s sent me telling me he&#039;ll do this:<br />http://imgur.com/rMxrkP5<br /><br />And all the threats to my feedback:<br />**clearnet**<br />http://imgur.com/S1RNW4a<br />http://imgur.com/a/bwf7o/all<br />http://imgur.com/QCwi8FN<br />http://imgur.com/xHgAWIb<br /><br />Please note a few things that prove just how batshit insane these are:<br />1. Heatfan is crossed out and Thurgood written over it. If I was really running multiple accounts and was a top 14% vendor on one of them, I wouldn&#039;t be so dumb as to be like &quot;o, wait, no, I&#039;m not heatfan, let me just cross that out and write Thurgood, cause that&#039;s good enough right?&quot; No, that&#039;s just obvious bullshit. Also, on my vendor page it says none of my packages contain handwriting, so obviously I never sent that.<br /><br />2. The Mods are on my side:<br />http://i.imgur.com/CsLtxFY.png<br />http://imgur.com/DTgHJsV<br />Here are the mods confirming Dealerofdrugs is Coachella420 and the like and just being douche.<br /><br />3. Why would a vac seal dog shit so that it doesn&#039;t stink and so that he would never have to handle it? All he would have to do is throw it away, so that doesn&#039;t make any sense.<br /><br />4. None of this exists on my feedback from people who have proof of ordering from me. If he could take a screenshot of any order placed that&#039;d be awesome. Just an FYI, those who FE can still update feedback. So if he says you made me FE(only people that place FE orders have to FE) he could still change the feedback, so it&#039;s obvious bullshit. Any screenshot of messages from me, or any correspondence or business would be nice.<br /><br />5. It all started on /r/silkroad if you want to go look. here&#039;s a link to where I got involved:<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1icxgs/to_put_an_end_to_the_dod_fun/<br /><br />6. Look at his karma... obvious troll. <br /><br />Just look at the facts and it will be obvious.<br /><br />Thanks guys :)<br />Thurgood<br /><br />

				All ScammerHoundDog is accomplishing is giving Thurgood good publicity by making his customers come out of the woodwork to defend him. (As if he needs any defense against these retarded attacks.) <br /><br />It is hilarious, however, that ScammerHoundDog-Coachella-DOD-whatever had to pick up a pile of dog shit to put in that vac seal.
