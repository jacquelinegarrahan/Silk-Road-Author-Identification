				i&#039;ve been a long time browser and active on the main site but never posted on the forums before. just wanted to get your input on this: <br /><br />attempted to order 4x of a listing at a lower than usual price from a vendor today in escrow. less than 5 minutes after i placed the order, it was canceled for reasons unknown to me. my buyer stats are impeccable. i sent the vendor a message asking why my order was canceled; they read it and didn&#039;t respond. after i noticed that 4-5 people left feedback stating they had to FE per vendor request, i sent another message asking if the vendor would cancel my order if i placed another one. the message was read but still no response.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been in a similar situation before with vendor &#039;xanax bar&#039;, and they turned out to be scamming people (it was confirmed on these forums).<br /><br />let me know what you think.

Thus the cancellation.
