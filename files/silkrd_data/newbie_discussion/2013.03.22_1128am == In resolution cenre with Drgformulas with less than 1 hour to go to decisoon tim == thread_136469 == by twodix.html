				They took my order 3x80mg oxys around 300 bux nto escrow&nbsp; a few weeks back and although guaranteed a 24 hour express ship.<br />I never received the product even though it had previously arrived no problems before using 24 hour Australian domestic.&nbsp; <br />The day I made the last order with them was a strange one and I should have tweaked something was iffy. Let it be a lesson for others.. <br />They had no listings up at all so I sent them an internal SR message and they responded within minutes stating everything was available again right now, like this very instant! Which it was, with an even more diverse range on offer than before. <br />I thought this odd, that&nbsp; they&#039;ve suddenly deciding to put up everything they had previously been offering right at the exact same time that I asked them for some of their products, but also thought maybe I was lucky?<br />No chance was I lucky. <br />I haven&#039;t heard a thing back from them in regard to the order, and they&#039;ve changed their vendor page to some BS about getting hacked and people&#039;s orders that were sent (by hackers they reckon!) and were supposedly tracked by them all being delivered thus putting the onus of responsibility for the financial loss of the supposedly delivered packages onto those whose money is held in escrow. They&#039;re trying to scam SR by getting a percentage of their&nbsp; supposed customers escrow monies, the cunts.<br />Whatt&nbsp; a pack of scammers.<br />I have no idea what&#039;s going to happen next to my 300 bux since there&#039;s no response from Drugformulas <br />despite their empty unfulfilled promises that they&#039;re going to put it all right with their customers. Now there&#039;s a countdown from the SR resolution centre to... what?<br />Personally, I deserve my money back 100% and I&#039;m expecting it back 100% as requested in lengthy detail.<br />I will update for all you other n00bs who might be wondering how a situation like this is going to pan out. <br />Fucking Drugformulas!

				Good on&nbsp; SR who have given me a 100% refund of my funds in escrow! <br />Much pity all those poor buggers that Drugformulas made FE, but that&#039;s a lesson learned. <br />SR is still the best drug dealing model in existence and don&#039;t ever FE unless there&#039;s a very decent history behind the seller. <br />Even then, you might get burned. <br />Enterthematrix, ozcoldhorse and now Drugformulas have proven you really can get ripped off badly, but I&#039;ll still be using SR though.<br />It&#039;s time LE woke up and openly supported SR as a model that governments could use to regulate, tax, harm minimize and which could make the job of a police officer who joined up with the intention of protecting the citizens of his/her nation so much easier.<br />When will logic prevail?

				Well done to all at SR, gives me confidence in them that they will respond to individuals and get these things sorted. That&#039;s how to earn loyalty from users.
