				So i have always followed basic rules(Use PGP etc) but recently i am starting to stress out a little more over my security. <br /><br />So i would like too:<br /><br />1) Clean my computer<br />2) Start using Tails/VPN/Some other added security<br />3) Find out a little more about being verified at an exchange.<br /><br /><br /><br />1) Apparently, to actually clean your computer you need to erase, fill and then erase again correct?<br />1b)After i clean it, would buying a 200 laptop and using that at a local wifi a better option for browsing TOR/SR<br /><br />2)Tails? VPN?<br /><br />3)I am currently verified at an exchange that allows up to 10k deposit per month in cash. I have the cash right beside me, can i just go deposit it without worry seeing as i am &quot;allowed&quot; to do so?<br />My income would probably not be a reasonable jusitification for that amount into the bank, but would 1 time flag anything?<br /><br />Am in the process of getting about 5 other verified accounts under different names with different incomes. Could i put 2-3k/month under each name even if there incomes are only ~1200/mo? Should i keep it to about 1k per month? Forget it and find another way?<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help i may receive. Once i get this one out of newbie forums i will post elsewhere.<br /><br />

				For deposits, are you in the US? If so I would follow the lead of Blue Sky Traders and not deposit or move more than $4500 per transaction anywhere.

				Am in Canada which means i cannot use moneypak or Reloadit, there is one cash only exchange but it maxes out at 1000 and is almost 25 dollars above mt gox, which at this price eats a large portion of funds.

				As it is only a two ish hour drive to the border, would it be possible to go down and buy up ~15k of money paks?<br /><br />If i do, what is the best way of getting the funds down there?<br /><br />If i slowly filtered all the cash into my bank and then online transferred it into an exchange would that be less heat?<br /><br /><br /><br />Never thought things would get fast enough that i need to resort to money laundering haha. Maybe its time to get out :S. Crazy!
