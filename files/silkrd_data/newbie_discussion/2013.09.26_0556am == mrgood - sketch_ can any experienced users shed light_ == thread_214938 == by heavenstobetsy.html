				Just wanted to run something by you guys since I would feel terrible not sharing this if in the off chance my gut turns out to be right.&nbsp; I actually signed up for this forum so I could post this here instead of right on the guy&#039;s user discussion page, since I am trying to use a bit of tact here.<br /><br />So, I wanted to purchase mrgood&#039;s FE listing of 1g, but after reading the conflicting info on his sellers page and user comments, I felt a bit uneasy, so I decided to pm him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I asked if; order wouldn&#039;t be sent till sat or mon, whether he still provides tracking number, and why the listing for the non-FE 1g option wasn&#039;t available.&nbsp; <br /><br />He told me that it wouldn&#039;t be shipped till the weekend and that the non-FE listing would be put up when everyone had finalized on his currently available deal (no mention of tracking #&#039;s).&nbsp; <br /><br />Super nice of him to respond so quickly and let me know some info but I decided it didn&#039;t feel quite right and that I&#039;m way too impatient to wait that long anyway, so I responded letting him know I would be looking forward to doing biz in future but the timeline wasn&#039;t gonna work well for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />The next message was what really set the warning bells off - he told me that if I ordered this now that it would qualify me to be added to his &quot;VIP list&quot; and that from now on I would be charged 120/g in the future, but if I didn&#039;t it would be 150 (despite saying on the listing it would go up to 180?).&nbsp; <br /><br />My problem with this is that it, again, conflicts w/info he&#039;s telling all his other customers on his page.&nbsp; On it, he says clearly that this is his new-seller-offer and he is extending it only til thursday out of fairness to others who weren&#039;t able to participate, but on the item listing it says something about a hump-day sale.&nbsp; And there&#039;s nothing anywhere about a VIP list or that the customers on it will be privy to the $120 price point from now on.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of this added together is just too weird.&nbsp; Did any of you guys who ordered his $120 FE 1g deal (before mrgood decided to hold off delivery til sat/mon) get added to a VIP list, and were any of you told that the $120 deal would be available to you as a result from now on?&nbsp; <br /><br />I would feel like a total jerk if this guy is legit, and I sincerely hope he is since before the last couple of policy changes he was regarded as best new talent, but I know how close I was to ordering and would hate for myself or any of my fellow consumers to be bamboozled in a way that I&#039;ve heard other vendors have pulled off in the past (offer great product, quickly build rep, pull listings except for FE, hold out shipping for days while the orders come in, and then bounce with the coin.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Please let me know all of your thoughts and if I am way out of line for posting this!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to get all demanding and 20 questions w/the guy - he may just have forgotten to update and streamline all of his listings and info maybe?&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope no one takes this the wrong way, either.&nbsp; The last thing I want to do is cause unjust damage to anyone, but since this is a community where trust in one another is paramount, I feel like it is the right thing to do and welcome all inputs.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my book.

				idk if you saw my thread, but heres my expirence with ordering from him, in escrow. Your going to hear this a million times over and over, but i would strongly reccomend against FE, SR reccomends against it, and all the veterans of the forums recommend against it. <br /><br />For trusted vendors with lots of transactions, and good stats, and being a new buyer, i can see there being exceptions, but not for such a new vendor imho. <br /><br />https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=214179.0<br /><br />thats my expirence with him. If you don&#039;t have enough dope to get you through til wednesday of next week, i&#039;d hold off from ordering. Or order an additional amonut from another vendor. My only issue with mrgood is my order was shipped monday, and i was told it went out on saturday. The postage was purchased, and thus the tracking was available on sat, but it was accepted at the PO on mon. I made the cutoff for fridays orders, and was told it shipped in time to get moving on saturday. Also, i had to pm him twice to get a tracking #. I understand he&#039;s busy, but just say so, and tell me its going out on monday. I was dopesick at the time, and thus i regret some of my language in that thread, but not all of it. <br /><br />Personally, i never FE. Not for trusted vendors, not for new vendors, not for jesus, the pope, or santa claus. Why? If anything gets fucked up, you have a decent chance of getting your money back. Since mrgood is a new vendor, and keeps dropping his price, at the requirement of FE, i&#039;d say find another vendor for the time being. If he decides to put up some escrow listings, or gets alot more orders/positive feedback, mabey. But considering my experience here, and how long his account has been active, and his requirement for FE, he keeps dropping his prices, but requires FE, i would not order again. <br /><br />Understand, when you FE he gets your coin. If a new vendor puts up such a lucrative offer, with the requirement of FE, its very easy to get alot of coinage very quickly, then disappear without ever sending out an order. Then you, and many others are fucked. <br /><br />Just a heads up from someone whos got a fair deal of experience on the road, and almost 60 orders under their belt.

				I have ordered from mrgood247 and everything came perfectly. <br /><br />I was willing to FE because I&#039;m new. I&#039;ve just gotten a note from him saying I won&#039;t have to FE anymore. <br /><br />He of course could be sending out great dope and great prices all with the eventual master plan of ripping us all off, but that seems like a lot of trouble. Its far more likely he has a great supply of dope and wants to make good money selling it at the best prices. <br /><br />I&#039;m new, you can&#039;t trust me. But thats my two cents. <br /><br />

				As a new vendor here is my philosophy. Keep it simple. Don&#039;t require FE and don&#039;t make it hard for people. Business principles work on SR just like they do in regular life. The customer wants a smooth transaction so if you complicate it, its your own damn fault. This is why we are starting very small. We have a great deal going but it won&#039;t last. Prices are conservative enough that people can take a gamble and we can build our reputation SLOWLY. One customer at a time. We are sitting on so much product right now its ridiculous but if I made a million listings with a million different deals it would be hard to keep track of everything and the possibility for miscommunications grows exponentially! <br /><br />In any case. Be careful, don&#039;t FE. Spend the extra money to buy elsewhere if you don&#039;t feel good about it.
