				Ok,so ive been using SR for about 6 months or so and after seeing what a delightful site it is,i want to finally become a legitimate vendor! the issue is that i dont have a comprehensive guide to becoming a vendor and am wondering what other members and/or vendors would reccomend as to what steps i need to take to achieve that.If somebody could give me a step by step guide to becoming a vendor,i would be forever indebted to them.If someone is able to help me i would help them once i became a vendor either by giving them some bitcoins and/or giving them free product iam selling.I&#039;m going to be selling 30 mg adderall and 8mg suboxone.Either way though, i need someone help. While i realize, the person or persons who help me,i will never meet, that doesnt mean that i wont forget about their help. I&#039;am a legitimately honest person and if you legitimately help me I WILL NOT FORGET IT AND I WILL REWARD YOU! the reason im trying to become a vendor is because i need to make money quickly so i can get out of my parents place because its just not a good environment and the economy hasnt been very kind lately as to getting hired with a job that you can actually make a living at! So this is where the awesome SR community comes in,so if your interested please message me and/or make a post :) Thanx in advance
