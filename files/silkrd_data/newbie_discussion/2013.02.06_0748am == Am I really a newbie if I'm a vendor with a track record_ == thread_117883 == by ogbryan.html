				Do I really have to make 50 posts if I have nearly 50 completed SALES on the web-site? <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to spam the board, I just want to reply to the nice things that people are saying about me and product in the rumor mill. <br /><br />How silly<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9ef88d66eb

				If you have been a vendor for several months and have 35+ transactions, then put a link to your vendor profile in your forum signature.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve done that, then send a message to inigo requesting access to the vendor forum.&nbsp; If you are granted access, then you will be able to post anywhere on the forum regardless of your post count.

				Thanks for the response! <br /><br />I&#039;m not quite there yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s been only a month and I have 40 transactions...over 50 including what&#039;s in transit. <br /><br />Thanks for the heads up, I appreciate it. <br />

				A good first step (which will also help you as a vendor!) would be to put a link to your vendor profile in your signature here on the forums.&nbsp; That way, people can easily find your products!

				really? I just ordered a qp from OGBryan, let me be clear here-its decent. It is not however AAA, at best I gave it single A-/B+. Zero and I mean zero smell. Low bag appeal. Very tight and small. Not a single 1/10 over, spot on. It was decent. 2 me not worth his price, there is much much better.<br /><br />As to stealth-just a passing grade, C+/B-. You really need a couple things-a dark layer in the wrapping, and to be clear food grade vac bags are not odor impervious. I wont be a repeat customer. If the package is violated, you gotta have a dark wrap in the mix. <br /><br />One word-Unimpressive.<br /><br />However speedy, and weighed, and decent stuff, just on par with whats out here, and not representative of AAA Cali med.
