				I really enjoy them in tabs form. But I&#039;m open for suggestions. I usually take them by mixing them in a beverage(preferably juice since it&#039;s bitter). Should I go for tabs like Mortal Kombat or should I just buy them by the MDMA gram?<br /><br />Also, I have only tried weed, ecstasy, and cocaine in my life. I&#039;m open for suggestions too.

				I buy by the gram and wash using dry acetone. <br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />A litre of acetone<br />Small bag of epsom salts<br />Coffee filters<br />Stirring rod<br />Two beakers / glasses<br />Hair dryer<br /><br />Instructions:<br /><br />Cook epsom salts in the oven at 200 degrees c for an hour.<br />Let the salts cool down for a few minutes. <br />Add to a litre of acetone and shake well.<br />Wait 20 mins or so for the cloudy salts to settle. <br />You now have acetone with no water content; a polar solvent.<br /><br />Crush MDMA rock (or cocaine etc) and add to first beaker.<br />Pour a small amount of dry acetone on top.<br />Swill it around and mix it with your stirring rod until it&#039;s dissolved the bad stuff. <br />Put coffee filter into second beaker and slowly pour the solution through.<br />Keep topping up and filtering until you&#039;ve got everything out of the second beaker.<br />You&#039;ve now got a coffee filter full of pure MDMA!<br /><br />Flatten the filter and give it a blast with the hair dryer.<br />Once completely dry open it up and scrape out the contents.<br /><br />At this point you can weigh it to see how much you&#039;ve lost, but you can be sure that the remaining MDMA will be very fucking strong and free of junk and any left-over safrole from the manufacturing process (a weak carcinogen in rats and what MDMA smells of). <br /><br />I then take 2mg per kg of body weight wrapped in a Rizla. This is way better than eating random pills made by dickheads who don&#039;t give a fuck about you.

				Sounds like a lot of work but I can guarantee safety and cleanliness from that. However, doing ecstasy is not really a long thing for me. Just wanna pop a random pill from time to time. Has anyone ordered from the chemicalbrothers?

				Yeah I can see why you&#039;d think that, when I was younger I didn&#039;t care what I ate and just wanted to get high. Nowadays knowing what I&#039;m eating is a bit of a hobby for me, I have my own place and can turn the kitchen into a chem lab if I want to and it&#039;s a fun way to spend half an hour, specially with friends who I&#039;ll be doing the shit with later.<br /><br />The best thing about purifying your gear is that you can benchmark other shit against it, it&#039;s knowledge you keep forever. I can take a pill now and say with confidence &quot;There&#039;s about 50 mills of MDMA in those, they&#039;re shit.&quot; I know this because I&#039;ve tested and purified MDMA myself, nobody can take that away from me.

				I don&#039;t buy tabs, just pure Molly. I don&#039;t see any reason to pay extra for a pretty design and pill binders. If you don&#039;t mind going through customs, Europeans have the best quality and price MDMA.

				Wow!, If the vendor&#039;s claims for those pills you ordered are right, then you&#039;re gonna be fucked! Looking forward to reading your report. Personally, I agree with the last guy. MDMA makes more sense for the reasons he said

				hello GFX4DRUGS<br /><br />Ive been dosing X in varying forms since 1996. heres what ive learned. <br /><br />1. Know what you are taking. ive had pressed pills containing everything from H to K and Crystal. ask the vendor. more often than not you will get honest info. Too often people are tricked into thinking they are taking X when its actually M1 (BK-MDMA) or 4-MMC (mephedrone). <br />2. know your dose. start small with either 1/2 a pill or 100mg. this will give you a good idea as to your comfortable dosing level and help you avoid becoming &quot;sloppy&quot; or an &quot;e-tard&quot;. you can always take more and keep in control. <br />3. Dont snort it. It hurts like a mofo. generally hits you faster but your nose and soft palate will pay the price. <br />4. Gel Caps are not necessarily bad. some of the best rolls ive had were via gel cap. your best tool is your nose, smell the product before you Buy/Take it. it should have a strong Sassafrass&nbsp; and chemical bitter smell. (opinion) <br /><br />I have purchased from Clearance here on the road. the pricing is good (5g purchased). the quality is good to better. the stealth is superior. its a sandy crystal typically called &quot;tan&quot;.great transactions. waiting on a S-isomer K order to arrive and expect the same great transaction quality and service. <br /><br />sorry to babble, Vikes just kicking in and i get yappy. Good luck!!!! <br /><br />:)

				I have never tried pills so can&#039;t really offer any advice on that, but I have quite a bit of experience with MDMA in its pure form, and highly recommend it. You can monitor exactly how much you want to take by measuring it out rather than splitting up a pill or taking one whole. Also, you can re-dose throughout the night by dabbing some of the the crystals on your gums - usually it tastes very bitter but this is a pretty good sign ;) <br /><br />I have bought from many vendors and recommend Symbiosis and subtickle in particular.

				I need to try MDA &amp; others. Been doing &quot;Molly&quot;/Ecstacy for years with quality levels ranging from good to horrible. Since I&#039;ve found SR, the increase in quality and therefore the experience has made my relationship with the drug much better. I tried a friend&#039;s molly yesterday and it reminded me how big the quality difference actually is between the stuff you can get here and your run of the mill street dealer.
