				I think the whole idea of getting to 50 posts so you can post on the main boards is about your contribution to this community.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to spam 50 posts and go to the board a few hours later, but why not take a few minutes out of your life and help some others that have questions and earn your 50 posts.

				Definitely the answer. If it were a reasonably low count, that&#039;d be one thing. But 50 is a bit overkill IMO.

				Apparently so. Most of the topics here are spam. There&#039;s not much helping to do. The vast majority of questions can be answered by looking in other sections or reading the wiki.

				Well, spam currently is &quot;the answer&quot; if you want to participate in the other forum sections - fifty posts is a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />There should at least be a noobie review thread - i&#039;m betting noobs would be more willing to take risks on vendors (looking for a cheap onramp to the road) and it&#039;d be good to give any of those people a place to review vendors no matter what their post count.

				I don&#039;t think I would have made an account here unless it was urgent. I need to contact a vendor that I ordered from, so I made an account on the forums, then I found out that I needed 50 posts to make a topic in the right forum. That took me about 12 hours of spamming, including sleep, where I just needed to make one post in the correct forum. I tried asking here in the newbie forum, mind you, and I didn&#039;t get a reply. 50 posts is just far too much, and this forum doesn&#039;t seem to have any worthwhile discussions, as everyone moves right along to the other forums as soon as they spam their way to 50 posts.<br /><br />TL;DR: 50 posts is too much, and there isn&#039;t any worthwhile topics in the newbie forum to legitimately contribute to. Spamming is the best way.

				I don&#039;t believe spam will help. Most people don&#039;t like spam.&nbsp; I say contribute to earn your 50 post. I&#039;ve almost spammed to get to 50. But i could never do it. If someone see&#039;s my name on there I feel it would decrease the respect they have for me. Also... If there was a review thread that newbies could reply on. Don&#039;t you think it would be easier for scammers to make multiple accounts and post on there themselves to make them look good?

				Been on SR for 3 months and didn&#039;t create a forum account until today.&nbsp; I wanted&nbsp; to contribute with reviews, but I didn&#039;t want to go to the trouble of getting to 50. Finally decided that it wouldn&#039;t be too bad to get to 50 without spamming.

				Spam is best fried with spicy mayo on a sweet hawaiian bun. add coleslaw to really make it pop.<br /><br /><br />and good luck contributing positively in this forum for 50 posts. at some point, you&#039;ll want one of my spam sliders.

				I just want to discuss Shipping questions and stuff! But anytime I create a topic talking about that it gets modded for being off topic or overlooked. So spamming seems to be the answer. They should make a few boards open to newbies, that way there wont be much spamming.
