				Hi everyone,<br /><br />As title says, I&#039;m an older fellow who used to smoke pot back in the day.&nbsp; However, back in my day, there was only 1 kind of weed available to us, which was basically what we called Mexican Dirt Weed, full of stems and seeds, etc.<br /><br />Fast forward decades later, I now see there are many, many types and varieties of pot, and surely way way stronger than what I ever smoked back then.&nbsp; Whenever I see TV footage of &quot;medicinal marijuana&quot; shops, I&#039;m amazed at the number of varieties in different mason jars.<br /><br />So I ask for help from the community.&nbsp; I have no idea what &quot;kind&quot; of pot I should buy today if I want to smoke again.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t think I need super strong stuff.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want stuff that makes one super paranoid, or causes ones heart to beat rapidly (this becomes scarier as you get older haha).&nbsp; I&#039;m just looking for something that gives a good basic high but not &quot;wheelchair&quot; as we used to call it.<br /><br />Please educate me!<br /><br />Thanks for all your input!

				Use www.leafly.com to find something appealing.<br /><br />Pretty much any top shelf medical cannabis strain will make you paranoid and give you a rapid heart rate because you haven&#039;t smoked in decades.&nbsp; All of it is wayyyy stronger than what you used to smoke.&nbsp; I&#039;m also surprised that you only had one type of weed back in the day.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t have stuff they called red hair, Jamaican, Colombian, Acapulco gold or anything? :(<br /><br />Even the brick weed should be better than what you described.&nbsp; If you really don&#039;t want it to be too strong then you might want to start with that.&nbsp; Otherwise you should only take a half a hit if you&#039;re smoking medical bud.&nbsp; Something like 0.05 grams...

				I hadn&#039;t smoked in 10-15 years, yes I agree, the quality product sold on SR is probably four times stronger than even the best &#039;nuggets&#039; I could get off the street years ago.<br /><br />First I&#039;d say start out slow, like take a small toke, and then wait a good 10 minutes before doing more. The sativa rich strains especially can tend to cause panic (at least for me) if I take too much too quickly of those.<br /><br />So right you might prefer a more indicia dominant strain. I&#039;m enjoying Hindu Kush at the moment, it&#039;s very good, but in highish amounts it really knocks me out.

Take a look at some vendors offering outdoor-grown priced around 75 a 1/4. Stick to the sativas or mostly sativa hybrids.<br /><br /><br />Phal

				My grandad told me about Acapulco gold. He said it was the best weed back in the day. 2 years from now he&#039;ll retire and i&#039;ll get him high off the bomb we get now, really looking forward to that day lol. Don&#039;t buy any commercial weed for sure. Leaf sells pre-rolled joints might want to check him out.

				I would stay away from any medical. I wouldn&#039;t even do it in small amounts because the effects to me are of a different quality than mids, its not just a potency difference. If you&#039;re looking to buy on the road, go for the second listing in the cannabis section,&nbsp; the quarter of mid&nbsp; grade. Its about 50$, so you&#039;re paying less than 10$ a g and it looks quite reliable and a good deal. I have smoked the type of mids which give you the basic high, nothing mind blowing or couchlocking or making you sketch out typa reefer everyones talking about these days, and that looks like it to me.<br />What I do when I want to chill out with an easygoing high that will get me out of my stresses a little bit is roll some trim up in a joint and that way I get a light high at a very cheap price. And I actually really like the way it smokes, since it takes a full joint to get high it actually feels like a full smoke, not like some of the high grade which knocks you out before you&#039;re halfway through smoking it. I dont have to worry about wasting it either since growers want to get rid of it and most people dont care for it, so I can just sit back, blow some O&#039;s and enjoy the flavor. If you&#039;re gonna look for trim on the road go for carlos lopez. Its a really good deal, I have some right now and have been rolling it for the last few weeks, it has alot of bud mixed in which I would rate a 6 or 7 in terms of quality. He&#039;s a pleasure to do business with. Heres his trim listing<br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/78482c49e9

You just need to try harder next time!<br /><br />But seriously, I haven&#039;t touched any mexican brick for 10 years now. Back then it was crap. Total crap. Every once in awhile, you get something decent. Of course, they need to start improving their product as they are taking a hit I am sure from what is occurring NOTB. Nowadays, I hear that avg. mexi is hovering around 8 % thc up to 10-12% +-. Great. whatever. Why buy it tho? Support the mexican drug cartels? Consume nasty chemicals from ferts and pesticides? Crappy processing, no curing and who the hell knows what else. I&#039;ll pass and stick to some domestic. Again, like others have said, find a strain you like and control your intake. That is the benefit of medical... So you don&#039;t have to subject yourself to these aforementioned undesirables (of less of them) because you need to consume less due to potently.<br /><br /><br />Phal<br />

				Thanks for all your responses so far everyone.&nbsp; I feel so clueless today.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know what Sativa or Indica mean, of course a few minutes on a Wiki page will probably educate me on that stuff.<br /><br />I mean, I&#039;m not THAT old, my high school/college pot days were &#039;79-&#039;86ish, and yea basically you just bought what was available, which in Arizona at the time, was Mexican shit lol.&nbsp; But yea some of it was actually pretty good.&nbsp; However, not by today&#039;s standards I&#039;m sure.<br /><br />I think the advice of Carlos about the &quot;trims&quot; or the &quot;mid grade&quot; is probably what is best for me right now.&nbsp; Not looking for &quot;wheelchair&quot; as we called it, or paranoia panic attacks.&nbsp; Amazing how much has changed, a beer then is still a beer now, but pot then is definitely NOT pot now!

				Yeah, just take the advice here and smoke VERY little.its way different than it used to be. I am of about the same vintage as you, and my feeling is &quot;2 hits are two too many&quot; a lot of the time. Small bowl (or really small water pipe), half a hit and wait 10 min before deciding how much more you want. <br /><br />Or get some hash and just eat a really small quantity of it.

				OK, so after a bit of research, and re-educating myself on Sativa vs Indica, I can say for 100% that I would prefer a Sativa high (more energetic, head high, not &quot;couchlock&quot;).<br /><br />So, what do you guys think are some of the best pure Sativa strains?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t know all the names.&nbsp; Except I read Purple Haze is Sativa.&nbsp; What about other pure Sativa&#039;s that you guys recommend?<br /><br />Thanks!

				What you call a &quot;wheelchair&quot; I believe the current term is called &quot;couchlock&quot; if i&#039;m not mistaking what you&#039;re trying to convey.<br /><br />A sativa is more of a &quot;stimulant&quot; high. There are over 400 diferent chemicals which get you high called &quot;cannabinoids&quot; the main two are THC(delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol).<br /><br />THC is psychoactive while CBD is anti-psychoactive. Yin and yang.<br /><br />THC is the main &quot;high&quot; and it is a stimulant. Cannabis effects are all detemined by ratios of different cannabinoids(Like I said there are 400 of them which is why all cannabis is different. Even the same strain grown twice, hell even two seeds from the same mommy grown in the same conditions)<br /><br />Anyways so THC is the main &quot;high&quot; while all other cannabinoids I think of as &quot;high modifiers&quot;.<br /><br />CBD, the other main cannabinoid, is anti-psychoactive. This chemical is sort of the yang to the yin of THC. It produces an opposite, yet balancing out effect to complement the THC. It is very good for treatment of psychological disorders as well as many physical ailsments. I won&#039;t go too deeply into medical use as it doesn&#039;t appear to be what you&#039;re interested in.<br /><br />Anyways sativa has a high THC to CBD ratio. This leads to a very energetic, creative, uplifting high.<br /><br />Indica has a high CBD to THC ratio leading to a more lazy, couchlock, sleepy high. Or a &quot;wheelchair&quot; high I think...<br /><br />No plant in the world is 100% indica or 100% sativa due to uncontrolled genetic mixing due to them being plants in the wild and all.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t believe the paranoia bullshit, in reality cannabis paranoia is not caused by potency. Infact I only recommend top notch quality bud. Ever. Paranoia is caused by harvesting buds too early. You see when buds are harvested early(typically by mexican shit weed growers and mids growers or novice dank growers) it will have developed it&#039;s THC but not the CBD to balance it out. This causes a fucked up THC to CBD ratio, THC alone causes paranoia. CBD counteracts it and soothes you.<br /><br />This is shown when people take marinol. Marinol is a pure antificial THC pill, noone in history has ever died from cannabis in plant form due to all cannabinoids balancing each other out but four deaths have resulted from marinol. It is known to cause paranoia and a plethora of other &quot;problems&quot; which anti-cannabis advocates scream from their soap boxes.<br /><br />Anyways so i&#039;d recommend buying bud from some of the vendors on the road. Always buy dank, become extremely familiar with SR before using it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be watching this thread.

				Heh, well call me crazy perhaps, but I decided to go with a little &quot;Super Lemon Haze&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably buy a new dugout (I like the ones that look like a cigarette for quasi-public smoking), and start off with a micro-toke, I mean a real small toke and see how it goes.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with &quot;Super Lemon Haze&quot;?<br /><br />P.S. - CannabisConsumer thanks for that great info two posts up, really liked it.&nbsp; And yes, what we called &quot;wheelchair&quot; back in the day is most definitely referred to as &quot;couchlock&quot; today!

				Lemon Haze is a great Sativa choice. You will definitely not be getting the couchlock effect from that :) Plus its a lovely looking bud and smells great.<br /><br />You will find yourself really appreciating the different types of highs and tastes you get from each herb, having access to so much on the silk road is a blessing!

				You might like Sour Diesel, that&#039;s mostly sativa.<br /><br />You&#039;re right, the sativas do tend to have a more energetic high, but be careful with them at first. Pure sativas or hybrids with a strong sativa presence in some people can cause panic. I had it happen the first night with the Sour Diesel even though I was trying to be careful and smoked only a very small amount and waited about 10 minutes between hits. But once I got used to it, it is smooth sailing now and no issues.<br /><br />Anything with much indicia will give more of a &#039;body&#039; high, like tingling, feeling like a monkey is massaging the back of your neck, etc. It&#039;s still very pleasant. I&#039;ve found though that much indicia will make me lethargic and usually I will fall asleep. The sativa rich or 100% sativas, wow, once you&#039;re used to them you can go out hiking or do whatever you want. Everything is just really intense and pleasurable.

				Hey mate just my side of advice im from New Zealand our climate allows for rather easy growing conditions<br />if you want something that isnt to strong 1st of all buy something that was grown outdoor as the thc contents drop dramaticly and so does the quality with leaf stalk etc<br />also i would sudjest trying something that was<br />1 . pure indica<br />2. pure sativa<br />3. a mix of both see what sorta buzz you are looking for<br />pick what you enjoy and go with that

				Here this should help with you telling the differences between sativa&#039;s and indica&#039;s&nbsp; <br />***CLEARNET WARNING*** <br />http://www.medicaljane.com/2013/06/28/cannabis-indica-vs-cannabis-sativa-differences/<br /><br />imo go ahead and try an indica but take it slow. take a hit then wait a couple minutes and take another hit. keep doing this intill you get to&nbsp; a point where you feel comfortable then stop. easy peasy. hope this helps!!

				The replies here are good. You may like a hybrid, too. I find that, while I hate couchlock, too much sativa makes me paranoid, so a hybrid can be the perfect mix. Yin and yang, indeed!!
