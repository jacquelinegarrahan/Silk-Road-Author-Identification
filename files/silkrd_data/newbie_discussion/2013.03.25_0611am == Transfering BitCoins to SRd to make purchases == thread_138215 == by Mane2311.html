				The &#039;code&#039; you see when you click on &#039;click here to make a deposit&#039; in your sr account settings is your sr bitcoin address. Send the coins from your wallet to this address, after a few hours the amount you sent will be credited to your sr account and you&#039;re ready to make purchases.<br /><br />Never sent coins to anyone from external wallets! If a vendor demands this he&#039;s most likely a scammer because this way you&#039;re not protected by sr&#039;s escrow system.<br />

				Thanks for your help guys. I was just panicking because the BCs didn&#039;t show up in my account right away. After a few hours they came through. <br /><br />The problem I have now though is that I can no longer access that account! I think someone has hacked it!! I&#039;ve tried every conceivable PIN and I cannot get back in to it! I&#039;ve had to set up a new account to access these forums and message support for help. I know what the PIN and passphrase should be! Will they be able to see if this has been changed by anyone in past 4 days??&nbsp; Otherwise it seems I&#039;ve lost the money to a keylogger/hacker of some kind :(

				Why would you have lost access to a keylogger? Are you using a public PC in a library or internet cafe or something?<br /><br />If you are brand new to SR and havent any stats, from reading up on it, I doubt you&#039;ll get anything back, too many scammer attempts.

				I noticed the link on the hidden wiki directs you to a fake SR that scams your pin. Thankfully I remembered reading someplace that SR will never ask for your pin besides when placing an order.

				Well i&#039;ll say this sorry but if you entered a pin your account is as good as gone as well as the coins... Secondly you should of read up on everything until you felt comfortable enough to jump in. I&#039;ve been here for a week or so and think i have a good handle on everything but i&#039;m still waiting before i jump in and try and order something just in case.. If you read the rules it states sr will never ask for your pin to log in, only time they will ask is to make purchases that&#039;s it.. Sorry it happened to you man..

				OK panic over people. I don&#039;t know what was happening last night but I am now back into my account! I&#039;m sorry I was getting PIN and passphrase confused, I was only being asked to enter my passphrase. I now know never to enter my PIN unless making a purchase. I don&#039;t know why it wasn&#039;t working last night but I&#039;m back into today. <br /><br />Thanks so much for all your replies. As a newb I&#039;ll take it as a warning and make sure to read up on everything before proceeding.
