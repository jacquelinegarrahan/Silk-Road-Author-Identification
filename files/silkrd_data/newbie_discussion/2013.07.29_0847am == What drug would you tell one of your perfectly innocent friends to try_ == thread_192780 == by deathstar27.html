				Forever and a day, MDMA.<br /><br />Just make sure you buy some nice clean caps (I&#039;d steer clear of pills, you never can tell) with little mini crystals in them. Caps being the capsules. Htey&#039;re great because you can pull them apart crush the crystals and insuffolate if you need to get high fast, or you can just drop them and let the anticipation build. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t give MD to friends that are on mood suppresants or anti-depressants. Specifically SSRI&#039;s but its best to just steer clear altogether<br /><br />Actually, you know what ever better and a perfect beginner drug. NOS (nitrous, nangs, bulbs, laughing gas etc.) It&#039;s a super short, super intense high that only lasts about 30 seconds then your right back to normal. Its also virtually impossible to harm yourself with it and best of all, you can buy it at your local corner shop!<br /><br />So yea, MD or nangs, both together is great too ;)

I like to think of SR as my backup or place to get something unusual not available at home.

				Unfortunately for me, the pilss around where I&#039;m from are terribly unreliable. Buying caps from a seller who I know is not going to flake every other time is a pretty nice thing to have. Also, I find SR vendors far more plesant than your average run-o-the-mill street dealers. Aaaaannnndd, MD is cheaper off the road for me. <br /><br />I&#039;m so jealous about the festivals, there was a huge one near me *cough coughsplendocoughurinthegrasscough* and I cocked it and forgot to buy tickets... not a mistake I will be making again. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				wouldn&#039;t go for anything mind altering unless u know the friend 2 be of strong character. something speedy is generally pretty harmless and can add up 2 an awesome &amp; big night. moderation is the key when introducing any1 2 something new, remember u the last thing u want to do is harm a friend - all that said.....get yr buzz on:)

Had some good coke a few times. But since its the G/F&#039;s drug of choice I can&#039;t do it. (She&#039;s a dope fiend) However she is fine with my medicine so I am allowed to smoke as much cheeba as I wan&#039;t.<br />I&#039;d say weed or hash but certainly not Meth, Coke, H, or Crack, wtf.<br /><br />Fuck the man!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />H/gear and crack sound a bit crazy for any first timer lol ....<br /><br /><br />I had a similar experience not as old as you but a few years ago my first time was when one of my friends actually put half a pill in my drink and didn&#039;t tell me till about 20 minutes later hahah ... it was what&#039;s called a Snowball where I&#039;m from which is a xtc pill (MDMA) dipped in acid ... he told me what he gave me when I noticed rain drops on the wall (it was inside) and the ceiling started to breath up and down but obviously this was all amazing at the time. Terrible comedown though. <br /><br />2 lessons learned that night: how amazing drugs can be and how shitty comedowns are<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MDMA is new to me, actually never heard of it until I came here. I always say &quot;Don&#039;t try anything new, because you might like it too much.&quot; I think its dirty to dose people without telling them because they never get that choice to hear those words. Glad it turned out ok for you but its frightening in a way.<br />Had a friend freak out on LSD somebody slipped into his drink. He almost got a felony charge at 19 because of that. He literally freaked and climbed up his really tall TV antennae tower in his underwear...screaming.. we were never sure why he left his underwear on, moment of clarity I guess because that was all that kept him from being charged, tighty whities. ;D

				Silly rule, you should try it :) It&#039;s well regarded as a pretty tame drug and if you&#039;ve got nice pure stuff, its very difficult to do yourself any serious harm. Except that is, for dancing too hard or accidentally becoming bestfriends/sleeping with an absolute asshole.<br /><br />

I know it sounds funny to ask: How addictive is it besides liking the results? I mean in the physical sense.<br />I mean I liked coke but not enough to keep buying it.<br />Weed is another matter, I went through an entire semester in college stoned off my ass and still pulled a B average for that semester. I&#039;m riding at a 3.8 GPA and that is being both drunk and stoned quite often. Maybe college is too easy or I am too smart or dumb depending on personal opinion. I never enjoyed being sober and alcohol is poison to me because it makes me do crazy ass shit with zero fear that I don&#039;t remember doing. And weed isn&#039;t legal...worse I might do is jack off in my closet looking at old &#039;70&#039;s porn.<br />&nbsp;;D :-X

				Alcohol.&nbsp; My perfectly innocent friends are most likely to try it, due to the lack of social stigma, and legality.&nbsp; Once they realize that it&#039;s possible to stay in control and enjoy an altered state of mind, I&#039;d be more comfortable suggesting other drugs, such as LSD.

				GHB is a good one based on the OP&#039;s search parameters.&nbsp; Pretty chill effects, a bit of up and then a bit of down at lower doses.&nbsp; Great for rolling around in bed with someone.&nbsp; And while some people get hooked on it, it&#039;s pretty darn rare.
