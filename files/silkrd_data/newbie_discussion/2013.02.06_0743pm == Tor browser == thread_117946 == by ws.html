				Hi was just wondering if it is ok to have your tor window open but also have another normal window open like safari or firefox etc open at the same time so that normal browsing can be done without running slow like it is when browsing with tor, so you can just switch between the two?<br /><br />What Im basically wondering is if I have normal window open when I switch to tor window will it is be anonymous?<br />

				Yes, you can have as many browsers open at the same time BUT ONLY the TOR browser will be routed through the TOR network. All other browsers will be from your IP/ISP as usual.

				I personally would only use TOR by itself.&nbsp; I believe I read that it is possible for websites used in the Firefox/Chrome/Safari browsers to report back other internet data even if it isn&#039;t in those browsers.&nbsp; These browsers have vulnerabilities that can allow someone to access your computer with relative ease, so I see no reason why I would like to have a program open like TOR which I specifically am using to not release date.&nbsp; Please correct me if I am wrong but I believe you would in fact be significantly more vulnerable.

				If you are using the Tor Browser Bundle then only the Tor Browser will route traffic through Tor. Browsing the clearweb in a different browser is completely unrelated to it and can&#039;t affect it.<br /><br />If you are worried about being hacked by a security exploit in your main browser then keep it up to date (including your plugins like Flash, Adobe Reader, Java and any add-ons). Most modern browsers automatically do this now. If your web browser does get hacked then you have bigger problems than Tor and not having the browser open won&#039;t necessarily mean you are safe once your computer has been compromised.

				I agree with safras.<br /><br />The other thing I always do is to use an anonymous VPN connection before starting up TOR. That way there is no trace of you using using TOR from your home IP. I don&#039;t have the link to hand but there is a post on the Security forum that lists a site which can find your &#039;real&#039; IP address even when using TOR. I tested it out and it successfully displayed the IP address of my TOR connection then eventually the IP of my VPN provider!! Luckily it couldn&#039;t get any further than that but it proves that with the right technology we are still not completely anonymous...

				The more people that are on here the bigger the challenge for LE, little things like this are good to know there should be an updated sticky in the security forum at some point with EVERYTHING on there.<br />Remember to respect your enemy at all times, when i see people gloating to LE it makes me uncomfortable.

				I also use a VPN before logging onto TOR. I&#039;m currently using GoSecure, but I&#039;d love a recommendation for an open source one, as I don&#039;t necessarily trust proprietary code.
