				Anyone else suspect this vendor as LEO? Just curious if any other people have thought that this vendor is collecting addresses. All of his/her reviews are usually &quot;too long&quot; and he sent packages with &quot;postage due&quot; to some buyers?<br /><br />Maybe it is my contact internal paranoia, but it just seems like a LEO operation. Can anyone vouch for him with 1000+ posts and a history of receiving packages. We all know LEO have been around since day one, but this seems like a lot of people are going to be pinched because of his/her legit stupidity or intentionally collection of addresses? I&#039;ll eat my words, but the trust level on SR has gotten so high that it isn&#039;t worth the risk. Especially when packages aren&#039;t delivered.

				I sent him a message asking about the postage due thing as I&#039;m expecting an order as well. He said that they fixed that problem as of may 22. Also he&#039;s only offering priority now, so I doubt he&#039;s LE.&nbsp; Well I certainly hope not, for my sakes.

				There is a difference between being an amateur and stupidity ... I think McFeely is brinking on the latter. I wouldn&#039;t think your package is going to show up. My buddy&#039;s hasn&#039;t. It had to go into resolution. I think this is a vendor that needs to get his/her shit together otherwise, he/she will lose customers REAL QUICK. From what my buddy has told me (I am a semi-lawyer simply from experience), McFeely is probably a cop. If he/she isn&#039;t, then he/she is daft beyond belief.

				Wraithe,<br /><br />You don&#039;t have kick around a newbie that doesn&#039;t have skin in the game. You are observant, but I am not my friend. He loves his dope, but I am an uppers person. I don&#039;t dig on what he likes, but I solid in my beliefs ... &quot;your body, your choice.&quot; He started talking to me at the bar about a &quot;missing package.&quot; I finally got the whole story, and as someone who has legal training, I went to worst case scenario mode. <br /><br />1. You use your real name.<br />2. You use your home address.<br />3. The person selling you illegal shit is not vetted AT ALL.<br />4. The product never arrives.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it takes even someone with legal training to understand this is a shitty situation. And you can try to call me out, but man, I could give two shits about your opinion. I have one also, but I just choose not to flap my gums. All 4 of those points without considering other factors makes me worried for my friend of &quot;x&quot; years. My concern is gather all of the facts and gather any anecdotal evidence I can to ensure his safety and to avoid any form of prosecution or controlled drop. Isn&#039;t that what people are here for? To help each other?<br /><br />I could care less about what everyone is into ... I have my hang ups as well, and I own them. I just don&#039;t want this guy getting in trouble. His name and his address are floating around &quot;somewhere&quot; with a controlled substance ... I sure as hell am not going to at least &quot;canvas the area&quot; to see how I can help.<br /><br />And wraithe, I know you are knowledgeable and have been around this for awhile (from what I see in your stats), but seriously, lose the caustic attitude. It isn&#039;t helping anyone. I noticed you are working a scammer thread ... kudos; keep it going for newbies like me so we don&#039;t end up in these situations like my brother here.<br /><br />In the end, I am a hell of a lot more knowledgeable on law than a lot of a people. Glean from the statement what you wish because I don&#039;t want to say anything else in connection from myself, but I am not searching for &quot;4th amendment search and seizure&quot; on google. It&#039;s second-nature after awhile. This whole situation seems FUCKED UP, and I told him to cancel any current orders to avoid any further bullshit.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.

				well your lawyer training would tell you that delivery of a supposed controlled substance and being in possession of said substance would be more advantageous than intent to receive contraband.<br /><br />there is no proof he was the one who ordered it, if he never received the package.&nbsp; case would be weak as shit and prosecutor wouldnt want the case.<br /><br />so you need to get a refund on your law classes lol<br /><br />dont throw around LE accusations for no reason.&nbsp; I do run a scammer thread that applies for members as well as vendors so, its my duty to say what on my mind when it seems suspicious

				Wraithe, I respect your input on this issue. The issue for me is this ... you NEVER KNOW WHAT THE PROSECUTOR has in his/her possession until discovery. I have seen my fair share of clients believe they left no trail, but in fact, they left just enough bread crumbs to entice young prosecutors. They are trying to make a career as much as the the PD or an expensive defense attorney. I will refrain from making any direct accusations against this vendor because I am working off an incomplete &quot;factual framework.&quot; My buddy is a junkie (no judgments), but he probably left something out along the way. All clients do ... they are scared to be forthright with a friend/family member/attorney because of countless reasons (usually embarrassment).<br /><br />Speak your mind ... it is your right, and if you are running the scammer thread, I suppose you have a duty to speak your mind as clearly and openly as possible. But, I know we can get along just fine without any unnecessary flame throwing. I&#039;ll back off from this thread, and if a moderator wishes to close it, then I have no problems with that.<br /><br />Really man, it is coming down to looking out for a friend and wanting to get something for myself after a worrisome situation. That&#039;s the bottom line.

				MisterMcfeely is not LEO! I had an order for one gram shipped the Tuesday after Memorial day and it had the correct postage and it got to me in two days (Thursday)! If it is LEO then there awesome cause two day coast to coast first class shipping, 2x vac seal with multiple layers and not to mention the gram weighed 1.2!&nbsp; HE is legit guys, no worries :)

				If he was LE, then I can tell you from personal experience that LE would be shipping genuine, high quality tar to their customers, and allowing them use it, long before busting them. I don&#039;t think this is standard police procedure. As far as I can tell, he&#039;s completely legit... But perhaps my 2 cents is irrelevant to you because of my low post count.<br /><br />The postage thing was just a stupid mistake and lack of being properly prepared. I&#039;m not saying he should be entirely excused from this mistake, I admit that I&#039;d be pretty upset if it happened to me, but they seem to have sorted it out, and also refunded everyone entirely. Vendors are humans, they make mistakes, especially new ones. I&#039;ve seen it happen a million times before, new vendors taking a couple weeks before they get everything together and perfected, or at least aren&#039;t prepared for the large number of orders and get swamped and backed up.<br /><br />Now, you&#039;re definitely right that address harvesting is indeed probably a real possibility on SR, but in the big picture, why would they waste their time? If anything, they&#039;d be going after the big time vendors, and even then, there&#039;s not really any practical way of going about this. Don&#039;t be so hard on Mcfeely and quick to make very serious assumptions, he/she/they are still new and made a couple mistakes, but what makes them any different than the couple dozen other new vendors right now that don&#039;t entirely have their shit together?

				FOR ANY FUTURE POSTERS, I RETRACT ALL OF MY SUSPICIONS AGAINST THIS VENDOR. I TRUST THAT THE SR COMMUNITY KNOWS BETTER THAN MYSELF ABOUT McFEELY. I APOLOGIZE TO THE VENDOR IF HE/SHE READS THIS. I AM A FRIEND OF A PURCHASER, AND I WAS WORKING AS A ZEALOUS ADVOCATE ON HIS BEHALF. I AM NEW TO THIS COMMUNITY, AND I OBVIOUSLY JUMPED THE GUN.CV

				Im a heroin connoisseur and I WILL NOT be purchasing with this vendor<br /><br />someone (and I PROMISE not me) left this review<br /><br />&quot;Placed order first time, was Canceled by vendor. Placed order a second time. Was again canceled by vendor. All reviews for this vendor were great. I guess he just thought my business was just not worth it.&quot;<br /><br />Well if hes going to mess buyers about cos they are new or whatever the reason is I can go somewhere else - out of princeaple - vendors need to know we do &quot;listen&quot; to other peoples reviews.<br />Its only one review but hes too new for bad reviews - Ill go elsewhere. Thanks anyway.
