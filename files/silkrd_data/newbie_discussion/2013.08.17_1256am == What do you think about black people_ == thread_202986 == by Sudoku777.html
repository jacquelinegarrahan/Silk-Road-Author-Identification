				Rofl I can&#039;t believe this is a question. I&#039;m colourblind man. I have friends who are both black and white (I&#039;m white)<br />The colour of a persons skin does not dictate how good they are man. You need to forget that and become colourblind like me too.

				Well, according to alot of statistics, for example in the US 80% of the inmates are african americans. So that would tell me atleast, even tho they are not the Majority race in the US, a large percentage of their population got involded in criminal activities. <br /><br /><br />While this is interfering with safety and anonymity, i would like to have a tab on this websites where you could look if the seller of the product offered on the marketplace is either black or white

				Also, you should be aware of that the police never sentences anyone to jail, thats what judges do. So by saying that its the mistake of the judges by sending so many black people to prison, arent you saying that the whole juristicial system is wrong in the US?

				My take on it is this. Stereotypes exist because largely, they are true to some extent or another. The problem with stereotypes while they can be funny, is that they also perpetuate the belief that the entire race of people exhibits said behavior which is just not true. I would also not say that the reason there is a significantly higher percentage of crime committed by black people is due to racial profiling either. Realistically, black people charged with crimes because they were profiled is probably a small percentage. Yes, there are LE officers who engage in racial profiling, but I would guess that a vast majority of the crimes committed by black people is because they actually did commit a crime. For the record, it works both ways. I have been kicked, harassed and had my life threatened by black officers who used racial slurs and treated me aggressively because I was a &quot;white motherfucker.&quot; <br /><br />If I am talking about crimes people have committed against me personally, then by far most of them have been committed by black people. Like I said, there&#039;s truth in stereotypes. It does make me more cautious when dealing with black people in certain situations and that comes from a triggered defense response based on my experience. I don&#039;t like that I feel that way, but again the proof is in the numbers. I have been beaten, robbed, abused, harassed and any other number of atrocities at the hands of black people. Does it stop me from making friends with a good person who happens to be black? Absolutely not. I won&#039;t paint an entire race with a broad brush because a majority of them can have criminal tendencies. It just makes me more cautious. If I were a racist, I would have missed out on knowing some downright interesting and amazing people. <br /><br />Bottom line, people of all races commit crimes, no race is full of saints. Black people seem to commit more crimes, but it doesn&#039;t mean you should avoid anyone who is black either. <br /><br />And finally, I know your thread was serious, but waaaay off topic and out of left field, lol.

Also they are supposed to be setting an example for how it is acceptable to behave. I would not mind so much if politicians didn&#039;t lie so much about their crimes, that shows that they themselves know it is wrong.<br />I personally do not think murder is a very important crime in many cases, seeing as animals kill each other every day, and I also do not think such crimes should be dealt with by outside agencies such as a judicial system. However I am not very well read in the American legal system to be honest. I believe humans should be allowed to deal with their own affairs and not be interfered with by enforced systems they did not agree to be a part of. I&#039;m sure that many murders are justified.<br />Child molestation is something which I view as unacceptable, however I also believe it is a symptom of our current social system and could be mostly eradicated with some changes to our current social behaviors.

It could also be that there are a greater majority of black people who live in poverty (again, ALL races have their poor) and are subject to other lingering societal disadvantages left over from the &quot;whites only&quot; era that come into play.

				well you gotta be more specific, and there is just one way of saying this clearly. You either view murder as less significant then corruption, or you view it actually more significant. Meaning that as a judge you would sentence someone to more years in jail for murder then lets say a police officer for corruption ( lets say that police officer taken money to get drugs across the border)<br /><br />In your view, its actually a lesser offense killing someone then being corrupt. Also i would like to know if it makes any difference to you if the corruption was done by a politican or a police man? are those 2 types any different to you?

				It really doesn&#039;t vary on skin color so much :/ I know white people who have the stereotypical black attitude/dress/lifestyle...&nbsp; Admittedly, I do beleive that blacks make up a larger percent of the uneducated and criminals.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t mean, though, that I judge people by their skin color.&nbsp; Alot of blacks/whites don&#039;t end up talking just because of racial tension and that is complete bs... Not to mention that racial tension seems to be being promoted nowadays.

				In the US, there are huge profits made by jailing people. More People of Color are in jail because much of the United States engages in racial profiling and blatant racism. There is actually a ton of info out there about the prison system and its relationship to People of Color. It&#039;s a disgusting situation and did I mention that it&#039;s racist? <br /><br /><br />

However, from my perspective there are more significant things in the world than one person being killed. People die every day. It depends on the reasons and the other factors leading to the murder. For example, if 20 people die in the Middle East today, everyone acts like it is normal, but if a little old man who owns a local store is killed, people will react much more emotionally.

I think a politician must accept that they should be punished more severely because they are an example to the rest of society on how to behave.<br /><br />If I was a judge I would see what the people in the society affected by the crime thought should be the punishment and then try and consider that in my decision.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Well judges always base their decicion upon the cause of the Crime. Thats why you dont get sentenced to jail if you murder someone in self defense. <br /><br /><br />Also if you would let the society decide what the punishment should be, why would there any need of judges anyways?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly, I do not believe that we need judges or the entire legal system at all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again you given us very good opinion on what you think. As you know its the right for all to express their opinion on this board. But may i ask you this, if you think this way why are you still living in a society that has these rules?<br /><br />May i give you some places that would fit your needs a little better, you should consider visiting the following countries that merely fit your description of what you think is right:<br /><br />Somalia<br />North Korea<br />parts of Congo<br />parts of Afhanistan<br />Oman<br /><br />Now, even THOSE countries only partially fit your needs. All of whom base their system on a basic principle of justice, wich of all who participate agree upon. Now if you commit a crime in North Korea, there maybe wont be a Judge to sentence you, maybe its the Great Leader that will sentences you directly, but he speaks for the whole People of north korea.<br /><br />In afghanistan you may get killed if you commit a crime that society sees as beeing worthy to kill someone for it, but that offense will be written down in the quran. <br /><br /><br />What happends if you let people decide whats good or bad comes down to a list of rules that the WHOLE society agrees up on, and this is what happends in every country around the globe, even the most radical and corrupt countries. There will always be a set of rules that the members of a society will have to follow in order to be part of that society. <br /><br />If you get a bunch of murders together and let them decide what to do with a murder they may come to the conclusion to not let said person get killed. Because they are all murders and none of them wants to get killed by others. So they form a society of Murders. Now the people that dont agree upon that principle wont be part of that society. Thus they have to be excluded. <br /><br /><br />Meaning that if you dont accept the rules of the society you life in, you have to get punished for it ( i prefer severe punishment )

				I believe that black people, as a race, are bad. I have been to jail, it is full of black people. I am not claiming I know why, I just know what I see. And what I see is that blacks\mexicans are the major source of crime. I believe it is because of the way they are raised, by a family\in a neighborhood that knows nothing else. I also believe that there are exceptions to this rule. Like any rule. I have some good friends that are mexican. To be very honest, I don&#039;t have any black friends, but that is only because where I live now there is a very small percentage of them. But I know to group 100% of them as bad is wrong, but I will say, 90% is a good number in my head. <br /><br />And what about that double standard? As shown in the Zimmerman case, the witness didn&#039;t think that the phrase, &quot;Crazy ass white cracka&quot;, was racial. Who believes that? What if I went up to a black person, and said, &quot;Look at that crazy ass black nigga&quot;. Oh, you bet your ass that would be racial.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />My way of seeing EVERYBODY, no matter what color, is this. If you call me cracker, white, or any other racial name, you are one of the bad ones. If a person respects me, they get my respect back. I don&#039;t care&nbsp; if they are the craziest black person ever, if they respect, I will respect back. I don&#039;t consider myself racist. I consider myself a realist.

Stereotypes exist because largely, they are true to some extent or another. The problem with stereotypes while they can be funny, is that they also perpetuate the belief that the entire race of people exhibits said behavior which is just not true. I would also not say that the reason there is a significantly higher percentage of crime committed by black people is due to racial profiling either. Realistically, black people charged with crimes because they were profiled is probably a small percentage. Yes, there are LE officers who engage in racial profiling, but I would guess that a vast majority of the crimes committed by black people is because they actually did commit a crime. For the record, it works both ways. I have been kicked, harassed and had my life threatened by black officers who used racial slurs and treated me aggressively because I was a &quot;white motherfucker.&quot; <br /><br />If I am talking about crimes people have committed against me personally, then by far most of them have been committed by black people. Like I said, there&#039;s truth in stereotypes. It does make me more cautious when dealing with black people in certain situations and that comes from a triggered defense response based on my experience. I don&#039;t like that I feel that way, but again the proof is in the numbers. I have been beaten, robbed, abused, harassed and any other number of atrocities at the hands of black people. Does it stop me from making friends with a good person who happens to be black? Absolutely not. I won&#039;t paint an entire race with a broad brush because a majority of them can have criminal tendencies. It just makes me more cautious. If I were a racist, I would have missed out on knowing some downright interesting and amazing people. <br /><br />Bottom line, people of all races commit crimes, no race is full of saints. Black people seem to commit more crimes, but it doesn&#039;t mean you should avoid anyone who is black either. <br /><br />And finally, I know your thread was serious, but waaaay off topic and out of left field, lol.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was gonna write something along the lines of what PAt1969 wrote, but he hit the nail on the head for me. Unfortunately it&#039;s true. But how can you get an idea about something/someone/race without using stereotypes? I know I&#039;m gonna get flamed here for saying that... but it gives u a good idea so you can guess how they are going to act. And to be honest, I&#039;ve been ripped off by spanish and blacks way more than when dealing with white kids. No white kid every fucked me or robbed me like that. but I have no problem with spanish or black people. I just use more caution when doing &quot;business&quot; with them for the reasons I stated above. I wish it weren&#039;t true, but for a lot of people this seems to be the case. I don&#039;t mean to sound racist but these are the facts for me unfortunately.

				<br />On behalf of those of us who intend to live to be old white gentlemen, I say this &quot;ripthesystem&quot; character is an uniformed ignoramus who watches too many fictional crime dramas where &quot;...almost all serial killers and kiddy fiddlers are middle aged white men...&quot; Not in this world. On the rare occasion someone is murdered in a small town predominated by white people in the American Midwest, the community goes to great lengths to locate the body and find and punish the killer (unless the victim was a real stinker.) Over the course of one year there are more unsolved homicides in a place like Mexico City, Johannesburg or Mumbai than murders in all of North America. Also what is generally regarded as sexual perversion in the west is widespread and tolerated in the east. Sudoku777 you should stop worrying about black people (doesn&#039;t mean you have to want them on the range) and take a closer look at the greatest enemies of the white race who usually wear white skin

				Eddie Griffin the stand-up comedian talked about albinos, that 2 negros can make a albino and he said they they kicked the albinos out of Africa because they looked weird and then alot of years later the white people came back with alot of parentissues in their heads and collected their parents by the use of force and then turned them into slaves..<br /><br />The truth is probably that more negros are connected with nature and has a healthy pineal gland, more then other races.<br /><br />And the white people have the fewest people who is connected to nature and have a workin pineal gland.<br /><br />All races are docile tho but when you have blue eyes then youre dying and it happens even to darkskinned people when they are about to die, their eyes turn blue.. And the pineal is blue when its calcified.<br /><br />That&#039;s why you often see alot of blueyed people in the governments since they are soul-less and they got no feelings and they are controlled by demons who took over their living bodies when the soul left it, thats why they can drop bombs on families without it bothering them at all.<br /><br />People still think they human tho since people believe what their 2 eyes see and the third eye is not activated in most people and they dont even see that its the governments against the peoples in the countries they have created to be able to divide and conquerer humanity.

				The first bag of weed i bought was in the projects-my friend showed me. I was amazed, like a drug drive through! Anyway, one black dude came up to&nbsp; my car-told him I wanted a dime-and handed him my cash. He shook his head and told me, honey-NEVER give your money out before getting your shit. Looking back I realize how stupid and naive I was. Never forgot how cool it was for him to warn a crazy little white girl-when most would have ripped her off. That being said, I believe most people confuse racism and prejudice. I think racism is when you actually hate other races. Prejudices are preconceived notions-or stereotypes-and I believe everyone has a certain degree of prejudice. So if I am being honest-i have prejudices. Like if im alone in my car in a bad area, and a black dude walks by, i may lock my door. But i do not believe in judging whole races of people by any standard. I judge each person upon their actions. I also believe that although things have changed tremendously in this country, it is still true that black people generally have a few strikes against them that the average white person doesn&#039;t. If you are born and raised in poverty,&nbsp; educated in the schools in those areas-you are not getting the best our country has to offer.&nbsp; Same is true if you are white and in the same position.&nbsp; I definitely believe that racial profiling happens, and that black people are punished more often and more&nbsp; harshly for the same crimes as whites are.&nbsp; And once you have a criminal record-felony especially-it is very hard to get a decent job.&nbsp; What it all boils down to for me, is to not judge people-treat everyone as I would want to be treated.&nbsp; Particularly, not to judge a whole race of people as one, but to judge actions instead. OF course the older i get, the more cynical i become about people in general.&nbsp; I know most druggies have a bad rep, and i get pissed because if people knew i do drugs-then they would think thief, liar.&nbsp; Neither of which i am.&nbsp;

What seems more probable is that certain races get caught up in opressive societies, certain races are demonized, they get a bum rap, then this &quot;-karma&quot; perpetuates itself through successive generations. In certain black neighboorhoods, most of the crime is black on black. Most people can&#039;t connect the dots and say it&#039;s racial, or it&#039;s genetics. But it&#039;s a cultural thing where one group stigmatizes another group.

				when small kids can order heroine then that is not a personal issue its a society issue and as long as the war continues kids will die because the heroineuse should be in coontrolled envoriments so notyhing can happen.. Now its like all druggies shut up about the war .. they got the drugs so who cares about if kids can order heroine and kill themselves.<br /><br />We should see past this war and think about the people aND end the war and then the price for weed would drop to $1 per kilo&nbsp; since the price would not be desided by the war it would be desided by the speed of growth so cannabis should be the cheapest thing on the planet since it grows extremly fast.

Always asking for money, much more racist towards white people, and generally just obnoxious and threatening. However, northern black people can be just as bad, but something about southerners...<br /><br />Also, white people in the south are fucking retarded as well. So honestly, everyone pretty much sucks.

				Personally I can&#039;t believe anyone is giving this question any serious thought at all. People are people, their color has no effect on what kind of people they are, they are who they are because of genetics, experience and circumstance. When you start discussing color you are just delaying social progress. There is one race; the human race and we all need to start thinking about ourselves and everyone else as capable of great good or great evil based on our bio/psycho/social makeup. Drop all discussion of color and start talking about how we treat each other and how we can improve circumstances for everyone and promote good, stop evil and do away with inequality.

Now white people dont know anything but they know they are afraid since death does exist and when death comes then you stop existing they think.<br /><br />White , blueyed people can even change their eyecolor to a dark color by lookin into the sun 1 hour in the evening and 1 hour in the morning before the sun get to much Uv sent out from it.<br /><br />That would not be possible if they was not darkcolored from start then something happened.<br /><br />The radiation is rising in the solarsystem and so is the cancer, white people will have more problems then dark people because of the lack of melanin/sunprotection. <br /><br />And the fact that white people can get colored from being in sunshine also makes it obvious that white people are black people that has stayed out of the sun to much and it had some negative consequences.<br /><br />White people will be the ones eating eachothers because of the lack of food while black people will have their food growing everywhere in nature.<br /><br />White people will be the ones that burn up when we go thru the rebirth thru the sun.<br /><br />But it still has more to do with the inside then the outside and the melaning since humanity is evolving from carbon to crystalbased lifeforms.<br /><br />Alot of white and black people will not make it becaue they are eating poison substances thru their food and animals should never be eaten by a herbavore like humans are.<br /><br />

				What the hell is a black person? Or white for that matter?<br />And even more, what is a yellow person????? <br />I live in Asia part time, and I have never seen a yellow person. Black? Well, perhaps a smaaaal minority in Africa can be called bluish black. But most are brown-toned. As well as we are yellowish-purple-beige-toned. <br />Skin color depends on evolution according to the climate, how hot/cold it is. And doesn&#039;t make a person less good or bad. However, there will always be gangs with mostly people of &quot;their own kind&quot;, may it be &quot;white power idiots&quot;, &quot;black gangstas&quot; or &quot;latino leagues&quot;, &quot;Yakuza&quot; etc etc. This, however, have nothing to do with their skin tone, rather something to do with a feeling of national unity. <br />I know &quot;black&quot; people in asia from America, they get way better along with the &quot;white&quot; travelers than with the African immigrants...

				First off, me being and educated &quot;BLACK&quot; man, I been all over the world and have friends of every color and religion. This racism stuff is fabricated to keep people divided like religion does. Thats why the media create stereotypes to separate the masses. It gets a whole lot deeper that that being that Africans were brought here as slaves in a system that was not designed for them to succeed in . Its easy to see. Many Blacks live in impoverished areas whereas many people who ridicule have been GIVEN everything through wills, inheritances and such. The nuclear truth is that ONE created ALL and people have been migrating millions of years so yes, some people that moved to colder climates became lighter and those that moved to tropical conditions became darker, etc. We are all the same. Where you live or how you live dont matter in the end. Of course I keep my hand on my gun when I see suspicious black, white, spanish or whatever individual looking shady. Times are hard and people have to feed their families as well. If you want to blame something, blame society. My message to all of you is to realize that we are in the information age and all this stuff can be found online or by researching. Not watching FOX news and anything that comes through the media. Judge people by there ways and actions, Peace!

				+1 ultimate reality<br /><br />the dumb thing about racism that most racists just don&#039;t get, is that their racism is based on the idea that all people of the race they hate are exactly the same. which is pure dumb ignorance and just downright retardation. everyone of every race is an individual, yet some people just can&#039;t imagine anything beyond the stereotype that society, the media and the idiots paint of them. i&#039;ve known many many black, asian and white people in my years on this planet and i know through real experience that none of them are all the same. you do get asshole black guys, you get asshole asian guys but you also get asshole white guys. on the flip side you also get proper sound black, white and asians. i&#039;ve known many sound blacks and asians. when you get to know them you realize that the good ones are just as good a people as any good white guy. the good ones are very generous, non judgmental and extremely down to earth. i&#039;d take many black and asians over a lot of the wankers that happen to be white that i have encountered over the years as well.

				What do I think about black people? I tend to think that we&#039;re people...<br /><br />I&#039;m quite amazed at myself. I&#039;m actually shocked by this thread and I&#039;m generally pretty unshockable. Once, after his initial pretense of &quot;I just want to get my post count up to 50, so why not enter a philosophical discussion …&quot; the OP reached the level of &quot;The only trolls here are the people that try and defend the niggers with their useless arguments,&quot; I actually thought it couldn&#039;t get any worse. Goddess, was I wrong.<br /><br />The life experiences of each individual may affect a person&#039;s interactions with others and, due to historical and sociological factors, in some parts of the world certain types of people may have more difficult experiences than their neighbours. What matters to me is what each individual is like today, after the current total of their experiences to date and what they&#039;ve made of them, when I interact with them.<br /><br />What next? What do we think of Jews? Of homosexuals? Of gingers? Of the Welsh? How about, what do we think of bigots?

				Indeed. The Israelites were slaves in Egypt and went on to own slaves of their own. Elsewhere, throughout Africa, China, India, Greece, Rome, the ancient Islamic states and the empires of Mesopotamia, slavery seems to have existed for almost as long as what we call civilisation.

				It seems to me a whole lot of people are still stuck in the MATRIX. If you cant decipher that movie with real life, you are still sleep with your eyes open. If any of you have ever tried DMT and still wonder about all the black, white, race this, that race, KILL YOURSELF!!!!! Better yet free YOURSELF. You live in an illusion plain and simple.

				Take a course in behavioral evolution and genetics. You&#039;ll find out really fast that we&#039;re all the same meat. The fact that african americans make up the majority of the prison population in the US has nothing to say of their character as a people. It says something about our culture and about what happens when a people are suppressed and victimized. It shows what happens when there is a high degree of prejudice (*ahem* looking at this post) in a culture.

				My American Prayer Lyrics - Downset<br /><br />Metzger! Farrahakan! Yup we got it going on. Race in the mix<br />and the melting pot&#039;s hot! Well, I don&#039;t know where you&#039;re at,<br />but I know where I&#039;ve always been: Downset at the bottom with<br />my underclass freedom. The birth of this nation, birth of the<br />systematic jack, from land grab to whips across black&#039;s back.<br />No progress money means more humanity less, nothing done<br />changed in this land of soaked bloodshed. Liberty only to an<br />economic few, patriarchal tradition to economically gaffle you<br />fool. Racism? Guilty! Thievery? Guilty! Sexisme? Guilty!<br />Executed traditionally. Living in the shadow of five centuries<br />misery, homie blind forced in your game choked equality. Why<br />am I gonna be like that? Why must I pack that vocal gat,<br />because off the blood of humanity your pockets are getting<br />fat? This is America the hatefull! I&#039;m gonna be down to live<br />this protest! I&#039;m gonna be down to die this protest! America<br />better check itself before it wrecks itself, because differen-<br />ces seem to be bad for its health. Black! White! Yellow!<br />Brown! Christian and Muslim! Heterosexual! Homosexual! All<br />want to get some. Democrat! Republican! They putting that work<br />in, Aryan nation! 5% nation! Native American wants division.<br />Man&#039;s diversity is American&#039;s biggest enemy! Niggas! Woods!<br />And ese&#039;s stifled with apathy. Standing strong like a soldier,<br />struggling like a soldier, taking bullets of hatred watching<br />my soul get colder. Circumstances dance on interracial roman-<br />ce, separatist fist bomb on this love at first chance. America<br />taught me to hate you! America taught me to hate you! Taking<br />shot at the external even though I never knew you. Will you<br />fade and follow doubtless next in the death rate, or love<br />suffocate beneath this fashion of hate! I was taught to hate<br />you and you weer taught to hate me! Love sees no color, but<br />America always will. Humanity means nothing in this place<br />where we learn to kill. I don&#039;t believe in this hatred anymo-<br />re... Red, White and Blue is gonna kill you! I throw the brick<br />of my protest through the window of your inhumane corruption,<br />and watch the fragments of your greed shatter to the frigid<br />ground...and it&#039;s like that! Martin Luther King! Ruben Sale-<br />zar! Malcolm X! John F. Kenedy! Red, White and Blue is gonna<br />kill you!

				The same as i think about other people.&nbsp; If they ask questions like this i usually i am weary.&nbsp; Have you not scene your share of crazy white meth heads running around do the shit they do.&nbsp; No doubt there are shit part of cities where if black is the major minority living in the low income areas crime will happen.&nbsp; Just like in asia in low income areas, same in us in trailer park areas.&nbsp; Crime will always be here, shitheads will always be here, best we can do is hide from the diving shit hawks.

				I think they are people just like us.&nbsp; They can be good or bad.&nbsp; Unfortunately most of the ones I seem to run into fit the nigger profile to a tee.&nbsp; Now i have met plenty of shitty whites indians and mexicans but not nearly in the same amount.&nbsp;

				Is this a serious question OP?<br /><br />You cannot judge people by race or culture.<br /><br />Some are assholes, some are kindred spirits. You cant tell unless you get to know them (which is the very fear of insecure, racist people)
