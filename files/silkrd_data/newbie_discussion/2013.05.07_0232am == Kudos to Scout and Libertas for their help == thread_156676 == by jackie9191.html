				I have been looking at all the crap some people have been throwing at the folks who make SR run and I think Scout and Libertas have done a fabulous job in keeping everyone on an even keel. They have been patient and courteous when putting up with some extremely rude people and I for one think they deserve a shout-out. When the coin starts moving again I&#039;m going to throw some their way and I would hope some of you all do the same. It&#039;s the least we can do for their efforts. Viva la SR!

				We appreciate the support!&nbsp; It&#039;s understandable that when issues arise, people get a little excited (or very excited, in some cases), but we&#039;re all in the same boat here together.&nbsp; Libertas and I can&#039;t actually fix the glitches, but we can do our best to answer questions and try to reassure everyone that the world (or our little dark section of it!) isn&#039;t ending!<br /><br />Thank you for the encouragement - it means a great deal, especially on days like today! :)

				I second this post! I posted about the delay in a couple different topics. I felt a little bad because I didn&#039;t expect they would address my posts. :-/ I was just trying to get feedback from others, and I know they have been responding to posts non-stop, but they took the time to post a response anyhow.<br /><br />I hope I didn&#039;t make your work more tiresome, scout or Libertas! I very much appreciate your efforts&nbsp; ^.^

				+1 to this Lim.<br /><br />I think that the moderators are literally the fucking glue keeping this place together. And thats during NORMAL times. Last few weeks have been a rollercoaster ride.

Deep down, we all desire freedom. It is hardwired into our genetic structure. When we get the chance to experience that freedom - by using Silk Road to purchase what governments do not allow, and conversing freely here on the forums for instance - it sets off something inside us that cannot be restrained by any police force, nor any legislation.<br /><br />These forums mean so much to me because what they represent is an essential part of my personal vision of the future that I desire for everybody - a future that is free, fearless and unrestrained.<br /><br />Libertas

Everyone should be acting at all times as though everything is compromised in order to ensure that they do not slip up with their security measures.
