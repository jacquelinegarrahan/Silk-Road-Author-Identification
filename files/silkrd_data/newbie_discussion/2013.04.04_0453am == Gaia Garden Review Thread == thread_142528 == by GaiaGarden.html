				Also I just wanted to thank you guys for the support and look forward to all the reviews.<br /><br />If all goes well I will be searching out only the best grown strains for everyone. I know about 15-20 different strains all around me, plus the numerous ones I can go search out. Once we had a strain that was an accidental cross of Blueberry and Jack Herer. Amazing! Alaskan Ice is a great everyday all day smoke. Prophet tends to be similar, but more cerebral.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what you are looking for is appreciated too.

				GaiaGarden<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/666fb9fb2d<br /><br />Hey all Im back here with a big&nbsp; ;D on my face to review three of Gaia Garden&#039;s amazing, astounding products! I got a chance to try out two different strains of his famous buds the first was called Alaskan Ice and the next was Prophet. I also was fortunate enough to receive a generous 1.5g sample of his personal recipe earwax! This vendor is very generous and will likely throw in extra with each order judging by his sample generosity. <br /><br />Shipping/Packaging<br />&nbsp;5/5 <br />Was on tap with all items arriving in the same pack. All were triple vac sealed if I remember correctly, there was absolutely no smell getting out of this package whatsoever. The buds were not compressed at all and were even labeled nicely! The labeling on the package was professional as well. Speedy time in transit and it got here in only 2 days. This vendors location is handy for shipping to anywhere in the US! <br /><br />Vendor<br />5/5 <br />This vendor is a very generous person. I always enjoy the ones the most who don&#039;t care to small talk and address some of your questions. This is that vendor. The other thing I like is that he is always online and very fast to respond to you. I have a feeling that his customer service skills are perfect for vending on SR. Not to mention his prices will KICK ASS! Going to make the market competitive! Awesome communication.<br /><br />ALASKAN ICE!<br />*PIC*<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2m.JPG<br /><br />Well I did some research on this specific strain only to find out great news. One of the highest recorded THC %&#039;s to date! I was stoked going into it. This stone was very mentally challenging but in a good way. I loved how deeply it affected the thought process. Almost a psychoactive experience but not quite that bad. Def in a good way. I would highly recommend this strain for painkilling as I feel that is what it&#039;s best use would be. I would buy a very large amount of this bud because it will last you a good while!<br /><br />It was very sticky and a joy to break up. It also featured a very fresh taste. Its almost as if each hit relieves a little bit more pain with each inhale. One of the biggest comments I had on it was how it literally &quot;brings you to your knees&quot;... Lovely strain!<br /><br />She is very heavy in crystallization like her white widow genetics show. I mean completely covered. Her looks are just as good as her other qualities. <br /><br />THE PROPHET<br />*PIC*<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2y.JPG<br /><br />This will likely go down as one of my top ten strains of all time. I enjoyed looking at/ breaking down / smoking/smelling..... every single thing that was associated with this bud made me fall madly in love with this strain! The strain is derived from pre-&#039;98 bubba &amp; tang tang. <br /><br />The smell is not as musky as the bubba genetics have shown in the past, but rather a kushy citrus aroma.<br /><br />&nbsp;With a background of the Bubba dankness, the flavor is lightened up by the Tang Tang, adding elements of citrus and herbs.&nbsp; The flavor isn’t overwhelmingly strong like a proper Bubba is, but it hands in the mouth in much the same way, reminding the user of the flavor seemingly at random for a while after smoking.<br /><br />The Tang Tang adds a potent package of head effects and seems to step up the overall potency of the Bubba.&nbsp; The Tang Tang phenotypes have a very strong head presence, with a feeling of a boulder rolling around inside the back of the skull at times, as well as quite a bit of eye pressure fluctuation.&nbsp; It has major mood elevating properties as well, finishing cleanly and without any sort of crash — it makes for a versatile medication suitable for day or night use.&nbsp; The Bubba-dominant phenotypes are definitely heavier, and if let go long will pack quite the narcotic punch, aiding sleep and relaxing muscles. I copied some information from the strains generic information. I can assure you though that everything mentioned here is well incorporated into this strain.<br /><br />EARWAX<br />*PIC*<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2c.JPG<br /><br /><br />I was informed by GaiaGarden that I received a sample of some of the last of his personal batch of earwax. He also informed me that this is a very tedious process done by him and he incorporates his own &#039;recipe&#039; when making this wonderful substance. This will soon be featured on his vendor page at a very reasonable price. The tint of this earwax was on point for sure. A very dark tint that was a glazing honey almost. <br /><br />The smell was fantastic. I know concentrates aren&#039;t known for wreaking but this one is pretty fun to stick to the nostril. I dab&#039;d this on my nail&amp;dome rig that is like a bubbler. The substance has no problem at all vaping and is a HITTER.. <br /><br />A small dab gives you just enough of a hit that you need not to start dying coughing. Well actually you will cough quite a bit but not much. This earwax is very strong and mult dabs may cause you to sleep. Be careful on the inhale because if you try to go big you will regret it. Keep these dab sizes small because you do not need much and will over do it fast with this particular product. It is a heavy hitter &amp; I would only recommend for the experienced smokers!

				Full review forthcoming.&nbsp; Pretty high on the Prophet right now.&nbsp; It&#039;s great stuff.&nbsp; I think I remember it being advertised as an Indica, but I didn&#039;t pay close attention to the info on that because I was just trying to get a sample of the Alaskan Ice.&nbsp; This dude sent me two grams of both.&nbsp; Holy crap.&nbsp; Anyways.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s an Indica and I&#039;m just a guy who&#039;s high, but this feels like a mellowed out Sativa.&nbsp; A very cheerful stone.&nbsp; Maybe a 70/30 sativa/indica split.<br /><br />Everything with Gaia has been positive.&nbsp; A solid vendor, here.

				Here&#039;s my review of the samples I received from the new cannabis vendor Gaia Garden. GG sent me very generous samples of two different strains- Alaskan Ice and Prophet. He is a cool guy to talk with and is definitely very knowledgeable about what he does. Judging from the quality and generosity of the samples he provided, it&#039;s safe to say GG is fully committed to his customers&#039; satisfaction and to building a successful business here on SR. I&#039;m happy to be one of the first to give him the praise he deserves. I have a feeling there will be many more to come.<br /><br />On to the review...<br /><br />Shipping (5/5) - I placed my order for the samples late Thursday night/early Friday morning. GG informed me that he would put the package in the mail first thing that morning. It arrived today, Monday, so he was definitely on top of it. No worries in this department. You should have no issues with shipping/response time when dealing with GG.<br /><br />Stealth/Packaging (5/5) - This was very well done, as well. The outside of the package was inconspicuous and discreet, with printed labels and clean, professional packaging methods. No sloppy tape, rips, etc. On the inside, it was similarly well done. I had asked GG to label the samples, which he did, and they were double vac sealed with plenty of visual barrier on all sides. The visual barrier also doubled as a clever way to add a little more weight to the package, making it seem like something else entirely. Not a bit of smell until breaking the last seal on the buds. Again, no worries in this department. GG has you taken care of.<br /><br />Product (5/5) - The first sample that I tried was the Alaskan Ice. Clearnet pic -----&gt; http://i.imgur.com/eLE3yVb.jpg<br /><br />I am somewhat familiar with this strain, but it has been quite some time since I have had the chance to get my hands on some. I was quickly reminded of what a great strain this is. Upon initial inspection, I was greeted with a pungent, spicy aroma. The undertones were almost skunk-like, but not quite; I would describe them as piney. It was sort of like what you would envision an exotic rainforest to smell like; just really bright and clean. The buds are a mixture of light and mid green with bright orange hairs crawling all over. These buds were given a nice trim job, as well. Properly cured, with a nice density, but just the right amount of &quot;give&quot; when giving the bud a gentle squeeze. The bud is coated with a thick layer of sticky trichs. And I mean STICKY. It is so sticky that it is almost a bit of a chore to grind up, but nevertheless it ground up pretty well and, as expected, produced a very nice amount of kief. I can&#039;t imagine trying to break this bud down by hand. <br /><br />The Alaskan Ice has a taste that is similar to its smell. There is more of a fresh, earthy undertone on inhale, while the exhale provides the pleasant spiciness that is present in the scent. After vaping a good sized bowl, the high crept up and set in quickly. The sativa dominance was apparent almost immediately as a warm, euphoric state of mind took over. Just a bright, clean high with a nice alertness and sense of awareness. Best described as a &quot;soaring&quot; type of high, in my opinion. The indica traits are noticeable as well, although obviously less so. But you still get a nice bit of stoniness that sets in later on in the high and provides a bit of a mellow, relaxed feeling. However, the cerebral effects are on full display at all times and are clearly the redeeming quality of this strain. A very enjoyable strain to experience.<br /><br />I moved on to the Prophet a few hours later. Clearnet pic -----&gt; http://i.imgur.com/aNReoHO.jpg<br /><br />This was my first experience with this strain, and it definitely did not disappoint. This strain had less of a pungent aroma than the AI, but it&#039;s still worthy of noting. The scent was slightly more musty, although not overpowering, with floral hints. Also a bit of a hash undertone. The bud is a bright lime green with reddish-orange pistils curled around it. A bit more leafy than the AI, but still well trimmed, and covered with glistening trichs. The Prophet was quite a bit more dense than the AI as well. These are some rock hard nuggets. They were clearly well taken care of during every step of the growing process. <br /><br />I broke out my glass for this strain since my girlfriend had commandeered my vape. The inhale was smooth, but potent. The taste was quite the contrast to the AI, with the main difference being the dominating presence of kush. Upon exhale, a bit of citrus is noticeable, along with the undertones of hash that are present in the scent. A nice lung expander, for sure. The bud was flushed properly and burned to a light white ash. The high was also in direct contrast to the AI. This is an indica dominant strain which provides a mellow, peaceful full body experience. The heady buzz is still there in nice balance, but the relaxing, somewhat narcotic effects are what this strain is all about. I sank into the couch after smoking and was just in one of those familiar trances. Fairly long lasting effects, as well, when compared to many other modern strains. Another very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Overall (5/5) - I am very impressed with Gaia Garden. He delivered in every aspect of the transaction, and I would certainly not hesitate to do business with him in the future. As I stated earlier, he was very generous with his samples. Thanks for that, GG. I fully expect him to be successful here on SR if he continues to provide product and service of this quality. Thanks again GG, and I look forward to dealing with you again sometime soon.

This guy deserves some exposure outside the newb forum.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142566.msg992207#msg992207

				I type this my fellow roaders with low eyes, a dry mouth, and a smile on my face.<br /><br />Shipping 5/5<br />Asked Gaia if there was a possibility of a sampler on tuesday, he then confirmed that it would go out Wednesday. Received the goods on Friday afternoon. Faster than Ladybird after one of my propane grilled T-bones I&#039;ll tell ya h&#039;wat!<br /><br />Stealth/Packaging 5/5<br />Not only did the sampler arrive, but it took a knife to get through the packaging. Much better than I&#039;ve seen with previous MMJ vendors.. but then again it was only for a couple grams.&nbsp; I would like to see how his full oz shipment compares. For a new vendor you&#039;re doing A-OKAY in this department. Maybe a third vacuum and you&#039;re gold.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />(Initially I reached out to Gaia for a .5 sampler of each strain in hopes of a response, and when I received the package there was a generous 1.3 of each strain.. what a pal!)<br /><br />Product 1 (Alaskan Ice)<br />Nice sweet aroma and taste that is typical with White Widow. But also has that hint of haze from its genetic precursor.&nbsp; The strain has a very nice energetic and rather uplifting high, but with a higher THC content that it&#039;s genetic precursors the high lasts a bit longer. A nice everyday smoke in my opinion. I give this strain a <br /><br />4.5/5 <br /><br />only because I&#039;m an Indica man, and this is more than obviously a sativa. Awesome smoke, don&#039;t get my wrong.. but everyone has their preference right?<br /><br />Product 2 (Prophet)<br />I&#039;ve personally never smoked Bubba &#039;98 nor am I familiar with the &quot;tang tang&quot; plants.. but I do know that this is my favorite strain of the two Gaia currently has to offer. Everything from it&#039;s beautiful bud structure to it&#039;s sweet yet spicy inhale/exhale has got my praising this strain.&nbsp; Having ordered from previous vendors such as lucymcgee, mrhumboldt, rocker, etc.. GaiaGarden&#039;s Prophet has got to be my favorite strain tried thus far.&nbsp; Thick smoke and strong effects with this one, a nice cerebral high with ever so relaxing neck buzz.&nbsp; Named Prophet with good reason, this is one you guys don&#039;t want to miss. Gaia has my trust, I&#039;d favorite this vendor and place an order ASAP.. I know I will be.&nbsp; I give the Prophet strain a <br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Overall Sampler Experience<br />5/5<br /><br />Gaia thank you very much for the opportunity to sample your lovely strains and provide feedback, only thing I will add is the compression of the alaskan ice strain.&nbsp; I mean I&#039;ve had compression before, but it was pretty flat.. not complaining, just stating.. curious as to how the compression might compare with half oz - full oz listings. <br /><br />Stay medicated my friends&nbsp; 8)

				I know I&#039;m too late to get any freebies but, that is O.K with me. I&#039;ve been waiting to recover the money I lost on the BTC crash and, I have seen your offerings Gaia Garden. (The name sticks out) I am going to remember you now because, I am going to come back and read the review on your product. I have a feeling your stuff is top shelf and, if income allows I&#039;ll place an order some time and be sending you and your garden some good karma. I&#039;ll be looking to Bookmark / favorite you too. Just stay in it for the long run because once a buyer has confidence in a vendor they tend to stay put. <br /><br />-Agape from a place of forgetting<br /><br />oubilette99

				Haven&#039;t received the Prophet yet, but it shipped next day. Which is awesome for me, since I&#039;m new to SR and didn&#039;t expect any vendor to trust me. If the Prophet looks as good as the pictures I&#039;ll be real pleased. Will update with pictures when it arrives

				Alright fellas. I have received the free samples from Gaia Garden.&nbsp; Received it international within 7 days.<br /><br />Firstly: THANK YOU very much Gaia Garden for the free samples. I got 2g each!!&nbsp; The packaging was really stealth. <br /><br />Both strains are killer potent IMO. The Prophet especially is filled with copious amount of crystals, and is super duper potent.&nbsp; Alaskan Ice is amazing also, with its clear, cerebral high.<br /><br />When I was vaping the Prophet, I did find its taste to be a bit strong. But with the strong taste, its high is matched proportionately!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Again, my sincere thanks to Gaia Garden for the free samples! :)&nbsp; And yes, I will be ordering from you in the near future for sure!

				Glad everyone is enjoying the smoke. Yeah my stealth has been upgraded after reading a bit on the forums, even though it was mostly ok. I&#039;m just trying to get to best I can do. And I do plan on going easier on vacuum now with my upgraded stealth. Maybe I was a bit careless on a few of my packages. Some only got two instead of three layers of Vac seal. This has all been resolved though. I really appreciate the feedback. Look forward to my Honey Butane Earwax, Ketamine and MDMA here this week. These have been sourced from the best of the best.&nbsp;

				So I finally made some earwax HBO and it looks amazing. I will have about ten samples to hand out to the right people. Hit me up on my sellers account if you have good stats. I rarely check my messages here. Also I do have some MDMA for sale, but only a limited supply. This stuff is what my close group of friends takes to party.

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />At last I&#039;ve received the package! There was some local shit in my post office, &#039;cause the package arrived a week earlier, but I haven&#039;t been notified.<br /><br />Shipping 5/5<br />Sample has been sent very quickly (just after few hours after my PM) and arrived within 14 days (Ukraine).<br /><br />Stealth/Packaging 5/5<br />As for me, it&#039;s really cool that the package avoided being seized by customs or being stolen by postmen. Stealth packaging: double vac is splendidly.<br /><br />Alaskan Ice 5/5<br />Luxurious smell and awesome smoke.<br /><br />Prophet 5/5<br />Remarkable taste!<br /><br />Summary 5/5<br />GaiaGarden, thank you a lot for the sample! These strains are awesome, it&#039;s great that these buds were home grown with love! I was also surprised by the quantities - the sample is really generous. Thanks a lot for really tasty and potent buds!<br />https://imageshack.us/a/img209/7590/img3042012013311.jpg

				I&#039;m waiting on 1oz of the Prophet. After reading through this thread and seeing the pictures, looks like I made a good choice. Gaia managed to get it sent out even while SR was having problems which is a plus.<br /><br />Unless I&#039;m mistaken I think GG grows him/herself so there&#039;s no middleman which means really good prices. Assuming the bud is as good as others have mentioned, I&#039;m pretty sure this is the best price you&#039;ll find for &#039;top shelf&#039; on here.

				so my order came in today, less than 72 hours from checkout.. great stealth, some of the best i&#039;ve seen on here.<br /><br />i made a custom order for 8gs of BHO for an awesome and very affordable price, didnt weigh it cuz my dumb ass stepped on my scale the other day, but it is definitely more than 8g..&nbsp; upon opening the parchment paper (THANK YOU for not using messy wax paper!!) the smell is pretty immediate.&nbsp; very pleasant, sometimes bho reeks and this definitely had a strong odor but wasn&#039;t nauseating like some can be..&nbsp; very fresh.&nbsp; the taste is similar, delicious, and makes me draw slower just so i can taste the smoke more..&nbsp; <br /><br />it disappeared without a trace off my Ti nail, literally, i almost never see bho vape this clean.&nbsp; awesome honeycomb texture thats a lil hard to get on the dabber but i resisted the urge to just dunk a chunk and im glad i did.. FUCKIN A i am a strictly concentrate smoker and i need to be conservative when i dab this its so strong, i love it so much, instant red-eye, total and complete stonedness sets in moments later, perfect for any time of the day seriously seriously helps me with my medical problems, moreso than just about any other concentrate has.&nbsp; if this vendor has concentrates up for sale again any time soon you NEED to pick some up, blows away all the other vendors totally.&nbsp; this chunk is a thing of pure beauty and i will be dabbing off it like crazy for many days to come..<br /><br />5/5 all day THANK YOU GG

				I would like to tell you guys of my experience with GaiaGarden.&nbsp; I was looking for a new vendor to try, and after reading all of the reviews and reading his vendor page, I decided to shoot GaiaGarden a message.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get many chances to order Sativa&#039;s and I noticed he had a few strains of those.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this stage of the game (getting to finally smoke weed after a decade of laying off due to random drug testing) I want to try different strains to find weed that helps with pain, and also gives me a pleasurable buzz.<br /><br />I had roughly a 100 bucks in my account and wanted to spend it all, so I asked GaiaGarden if they would create a custom listing for all my money and if I could get 4 strains to try.&nbsp; He responded that he would do that and minutes later a custom listing was available for me.&nbsp; He gave me roughly 2.5 grams of each of 4 strains.&nbsp; I know the extra work that is involved in packing up 4 strains and also creating a custom listing, so I was very pleased that he was willing to accommodate my request.&nbsp; Working with the customer, rates very high in my book.&nbsp; Please keep in mind, while he accommodated my needs and created a custom listing, I am not inferring he does that for everyone.&nbsp; He may well, but I do not want to give the impression that everyone should just expect that.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Communication: (5 of 5)&nbsp; We sent a few messages back and forth and he was very prompt and answered all questions<br /><br />Shipping: (5 of 5)&nbsp; It was In Transit the next day after ordering it, and I received it in 2 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stealth: (5 of 5)&nbsp; It was packed beautifully.&nbsp; Each strain was vacuum sealed and labeled.&nbsp; There was multiple levels of protection and implemented MBB.&nbsp; No smell whatsoever, until opening final bag.&nbsp; Outside of box was professional and nondescript.<br /><br />Product: (5 of 5)&nbsp; I ordered Triple Diesel, Sour Diesel, Cough and Sage.&nbsp; All 4 of them were A++ weed.&nbsp; Each one had it&#039;s own distinctive smell and taste.&nbsp; It was nice to smoke some Sativa finally, I missed the more awake high.&nbsp; I could throw in a bunch of keywords for each strain, but I will let my photo do the talking.&nbsp; I have included all 4 strains on one photo, so you don&#039;t have to click on 4 links.&nbsp; I spent more then 5 mins on the photo, so please give it a look!&nbsp; You will see exactly what kind of weed you can expect from GaiaGardens!<br /><br />Pic of all 4 strains (Triple Diesel, Sour Diesel, Sage and Cough)<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4b1.jpg<br /><br />GaiaGardens has earned a top spot in my go-to vendors for fine medical weed.&nbsp; Every aspect of my interaction with him/her, was top notch.&nbsp; They worked with me on my needs, they responded in a timely fashion, they were very fair on their pricing, they aren&#039;t the type to blow smoke up your ass and hype their products to be more then what they are.&nbsp; They sent my order and I got it 2 days later and most of all.... all 4 strains of the weed, was top notch!&nbsp; I am enjoying every toke of each strain!!<br /><br />GaiaGardens is the perfect example of what SilkRoad stands for, in the Vendor area.&nbsp; I believe they are a small growing operation, so the weed you get, was grown by the same person that&#039;s selling it to you.&nbsp; They are honest, low-key, flexible with the customer, have fair pricing and it is not about quantity with the, it&#039;s about quality.<br /><br />Thanks GaiaGardens for a perfect transaction!!! :)<br /><br />You can visit them on the Road at&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/666fb9fb2d<br /><br />You won&#039;t be disappointed!

				Very well said, PoolPlaya!<br /><br />I love reading reviews like these from buyers. <br /><br />My experience with Gaia Garden was stellar to say the least. This was my 1st cannabis purchase from SR. I am still in awe over this Sour Diesel. This tasty Sativa strain is going to be my all time favorite I believe, or at least until I can find another Sativa to prove me wrong. <br /><br />Everything about Gaia Garden is PHENOMENAL! Processing-&gt;Transit, Shipping, Quality, Weight, and Customer Service (did I miss anything?) exceeded my expectations. <br /><br />Gaia Garden, you&#039;ve gained a repeat customer for sure. Keep up the great work!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This guy has some awesome BHO. I got the Banana Kush wax and the taste is among the best I&#039;ve had. Awesome stealth, shipping time, customer service, and a beast product. Will be back for more, I remember it like it was yesterday I was sampling your buds when you were a new vendor!<br /><br />Cheers to the positive progression!

				It&#039;s a hybrid that leans more towards the indica side.&nbsp; I feel like its a great everyday smoke. Wanna just feel good and get stuff done. It doesn&#039;t get you couch locked or too paranoid...
