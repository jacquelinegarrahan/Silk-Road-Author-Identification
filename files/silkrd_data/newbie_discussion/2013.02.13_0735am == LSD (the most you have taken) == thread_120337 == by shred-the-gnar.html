				I&#039;ve never actually taken more than one blotter, but once I got my hands on this seriously bad-ass blotter. Went trippin&#039; like something else. Probably was between 160-200Âµg. Planning on exploring the higher dosages soon.

But then again, some people have natural tolerance and need to use higher dosages. I think it was Strassman who documented this oddity. What is the full effects, really? I have noticed that the effects not only vary in intensity, but also in character. It has to do with dosage, but also a lot with set and setting. It&#039;s good to try different levels and different activities :)

				I think the most for me was around 300 ug hard to tell as they were dropped directly from the vial. A very intense experience but not the trip I&#039;m used to. Rather than the calming state I&#039;m used to we went adventuring climbing buildings and being creatures of the wild. A night I will never forget.

				my first ever purchase on SR was a five strip of juergen2001&#039;s 250 microgram hits. (back when they were actually 250, now his acid is shit). I ate two hits when i was by myself, because I was stupid and had no idea how many micrograms a person was supposed to take. I was completely unprepared for this situation. I freaked out and called my friend over to come trip sit me. He found me in my backyard in a tshirt and boxers babbling at a tree. Thank you Silk Road for teaching me what micrograms are the hard way!<br /><br /><br />p.s: I am totally planning on taking this much again sometime. It was a VERY interesting experience, just very intense. You need to know what your getting into when you take that much

				The most I ever took was two microdots (these are the compressed tab form of LSD that floated around in the 60&#039;s for awhile).<br /><br />They were 175 ug each, so 350 ug all together. I had a complete ego death, tried to jump out of the car as my girlfriend drove me home from the festy we were at, and then proceeded to DESTROY my room when I got home. <br /><br />After I came to, I had cuts and bruises all over me, a hole in my wall, and my computer screen was cracked.<br /><br />Needless to say, I&#039;m not going over 250 ug next time, probably not going over that ever XD I will say, though, that this was the only bad experience I had on LSD (And even within my batshit brain, I was having fun at some points) I think Lucy was just trying to tell me to tone it down a bit lol

				<br />in 1979, i took 10 snoopy blotters, speedy stone for 2.5 hrs, then i would get a<br />mind numbing migraine for 8 hrs. i did this 4 times , same result all 4 times.<br /><br />32 yrs later w/o acid or any chemicals of any kind<br /><br />i took one 3jane alphaCentauri from June 2012 batch at 130ug approximately&nbsp; on New Years Eve<br />wanted to go see the fireworks but it was -32celsius with the wind blowing 20. Fucking near<br />fractured my mind for ten minutes, experienced my first ever hotflash, whoa, didnt like that to<br />much, but any ways no migraines .good strong clean lsd, not speedy though ?<br /><br />LSD in 2012/2013 is fantastic, real and you know the dosage, never heard of dosage in the 70&#039;s<br />you only asked if it was good. You got either what we thought was acid or you got ripped off.

				510ug, and it was full blown psychedelic experience. Not the most visual one, not the strongest one, but I think the most analytycal moment of my life, my mind was working like a supercomputer analyzing everything on so many levels.

				7.5tabs when I used to sell it a decade ago. We went for a walk, houses were spinning in circles, street lights were forming arches on the street and a walking path literally seemed to slam shut as I reached the entry. I have never been higher in my life.
