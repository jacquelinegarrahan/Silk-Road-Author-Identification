				Hi all. I&#039;m about to make a largeish order, a value of around £400.<br /><br />The order wont leave the country at all so no customs or international nonsense going on. I&#039;m just curious weather I should be tracking the order, the seller says they&#039;ll only offer a one time resend if they know it&#039;s gone missing due to it being tracked, although seems highly unlikely that tracked parcels go missing, what do they say on the tracking status &quot;We&#039;ve lost your parcel?&quot;<br /><br />So is it worth bothering tracking it? I&#039;m also a bit wary about signing for it, ideally I&#039;d like it to be just popped in the letter box with no intervention from me minimising all risk. But theres a huge risk in the package being a no show if I don&#039;t opt to tracking it.<br /><br />Thoughts on this people?

				Dont see any problem with getting it signed for there are no internal drug checks within uk they deal with 70 million letters small postal packages every day of the week. I recommend this option for my customers, cuts out any chance of scamming, and when signed for you get a code which the vendor will have to track you can request this beforehand ... i opt for due diligence all the time

				Yeah thats what I was thinking too, I know some people who work in the Royal Mail and they say no mail gets checked for contraband at all, unless it&#039;s blatently obvious it&#039;s smelling of weed or something. This is just pills so I can&#039;t see it being any trouble.<br /><br />I think I&#039;d rather be safe and make sure I know where my money is I guess.

				It is good to use tracking.<br />When you pick up, don&#039;t have anything suspicious at home.<br />Be ready to show what&#039;s on your computer (keep sensitive data on a Pendrive or external harddrive, Truecrypted of course)<br />Always say you were not ordering this, only something that is legal.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT
