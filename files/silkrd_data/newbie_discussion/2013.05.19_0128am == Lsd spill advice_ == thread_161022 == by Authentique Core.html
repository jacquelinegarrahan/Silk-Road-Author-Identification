				unfortunately my only next contribution to the msg boards is more &quot;Can you all please help me?&quot;<br />This time I was trying to do what the vendor JOR said might be a good idea, which is add wine preservation gas to a vial of lsd. I seemed to think this was going to be fine, unobserving the common sense that if I shoot a spray of air into a vial of lsd, likely the lsd will shoot up out of the vial and soak everything!<br /><br />Well luckily just the wood chair I was utilizing to work on, which I dabbed as much L as I could from its surface.<br /><br />So this goes out to all the LSD experts. I have a tissue soaked in lsd, still wet with it, that I sealed into an aluminum slip (you know, the aluminum baggie that our drugs often come sealed in) It was the best I could do... I did go and wash my hands, not wanting to skyrocket on lsd, like a little wimp, i might add.<br /><br />Anyway how to conserve this bad situation best!<br /><br />I have tissue, soaked with lsd (at least half the new vial of 100 drops) sealed in the aluminum baggie, but assume the moisture of itself is not good for it to be sealed up? Also I will lick the wood of the chair later where it spilled... any other advice, because (oh by the way) JOR&#039;s LSD is really great! <br /><br />There is a great cosmic lesson and also much to be laughed at here, concerning this financially poor, LSD crazy, just plain ignorant newb...

				I can feel your pain.&nbsp; They don&#039;t make smileys for the expression on my face right now.<br /><br />Remember that LSD is sensitive to light, air, and heat.&nbsp; Other then that I don&#039;t think I can help you too much.&nbsp; You can absorb LSD through your skin too.&nbsp; I have soaked hits of blotter cutting them without gloves in a past life.&nbsp; I would make sure that the chair is put away until you are ready to properly lick it.

				Ok thank you 013517.<br /><br />I have already covered the chair with a pillow just wish I could have it fully vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Well, shit. You guys are really the best i can do here? Is there anyone else who knows best what to do with a wad of toilet paper soaked in lsd?

				Put it in your mouth and have a good night?&nbsp; Your pillow will just absorb LSD off it too, so that really isn&#039;t a solution to your LSD solution problem.<br /><br />Sorry that isn&#039;t good enough.&nbsp;

				Hi. Sorry 013517. I didn&#039;t mean it that way. Thanks for posting and also the tips about degradation of lsd. Indeed eating the toilet paper seems like a very good idea. Never thought I would say that sentence, but I think you guys are right. <br /><br />Thanks again.

				man that really sucks. i have lost my share of product in the past. once i dumped a ball of k in the carpet. i ended up putting a pylon cone over top of it until i could discover the technology to separate the powder from the carpet lol with the help of many i got a hold of said technology after much searching and when i lifted up the cone the ketamine was gone :( i dont know what happened, the carpet snorted it.<br /><br />anyways, i&#039;m sorry that happened but be very carefully eating that tissue paper. i dont know how much lsd you got on it but it could be a massive dose. you don&#039;t want to take something thats going to be way to much. best of luck and be safe

				Its going to be weird if you try to sell the tp cause different areas will be different dosages. I suggest tell people to try a small amount, and if they need more just give em more. You will be able to tell if they are lying ;) Maybe circle the areas of tp that were soaked with a pencil to keep track.

				thanks guys.<br /><br />yeah i don&#039;t intend to sell it. I think what I&#039;ll do is schedule a day to go insane on acid (right between finding a job and a new apartment), perhaps finding a buddy, and just nibbling it bit by bit until pretty &quot;out there&quot;. Not to forget arts and crafts.<br /><br />anyway even though i appreciate the &quot;sorry about that man&quot; i definitely look at it as a cosmic lesson, and that it was meant to be. I reacted so strongly to it with bad things to say and think about myself, like I deserved doing it, (because truthfully this acid probably means more to me than most my puny possessions, and it is totally for personal use). But when I saw myself reacting that way, as well as thinking, &quot;How do I preserve it?!!&quot;...<br /><br />Well the main thing is I could see myself reacting that way and stopped it! Because what happens, happens, and the best thing to do is take it as a karmic hit, and maybe i made up for something that I did in the past. On the bright side, I still have a wad of soaked lsd that (I imagine) will still be great for a little while... of yeah and i have another vial and at least 30% in the one that spilled!<br /><br />Carpet snorting ketamine... good grief...
