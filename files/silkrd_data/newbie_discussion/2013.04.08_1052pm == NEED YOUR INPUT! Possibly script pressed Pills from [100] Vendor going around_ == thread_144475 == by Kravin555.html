				so these pills saw seemed odd, they gave off a small powdery layer where they were placed in a small slip-lock bag (finger across the line; approx 4&quot; by 5&quot;, and had seem they tightly stayed in each of their spots in the bag)... ALSO the more odd thing is 1 pill that has 3 numbers, for example 505 on 1 side and nothing else, just made that number up**, the pills are all very smooth and not chalky or &#039;very&#039; hard for the most part. so, all the pills had the 505 on em, one specific looked weird .. the 0 was missing and it was complete smooth as if it was just &quot;5 5&quot; pressed. Later the product was tried (2 of them; a strong upper; insufflated) and approximately 35 minute later ...weirdly... there was a period of fairly deep sleeping for 3 hours and no felt effects. There is no tolerance to the pills or amphetamine category. They were ordered from a (100) vendor for the record. When insufflated it was said to be very smooth and hardly felt at all going up.<br /><br />Are these pressed and fake? Is this person a con? Possibly a cop? Or Maybe a scammer? Or is it a freak accident? Or are there just asking too many questions being asked? You tell me ... (hahahah)<br /><br />If so, what plan of action should be taken, and alertion ((doubt thats a word haha) to the amazing mates here?<br /><br />Please, post your input. Thanks for reading.

				I would probably grab a test kit to be sure you are ingesting what you are expecting to if you suspect there is something off.<br /><br />Maybe even message the vendor and ask if he can offer any insight into the product as well.
