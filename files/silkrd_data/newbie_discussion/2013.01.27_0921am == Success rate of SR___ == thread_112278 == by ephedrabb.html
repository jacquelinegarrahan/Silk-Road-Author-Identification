				Just wondering if anyone has any idea how many people have been caught? I have read some stuff on Google of people getting caught but they could not get enough evidence to convict anyone on anything more than possession. Seems pretty safe but anyone else know if/ how people get caught?

				Not been caught: 25 transactions so far no problems. One transaction where I had to go to resolution sender. Sender resend but twee week later original package shows up, so not intercepted<br /><br />Order domestic if you can even when the price is higher. Domestic is virtually risk less.

				Almost never do buyers of personal amounts have problems on Silk Road, it&#039;s when you think buying in bulk and selling irl for profit does the issue become a practically concern.<br />I say this having close to 700 transactions of small personal amounts on a weekly basis so I keep my concern over orders being screwed up and noticed to a minimal that I never get a question about them.<br />I&#039;m a SR OG from the first 2k members with a new buyer forum account to be safe and not have to use my vendor username as a cross reference in a paper trail of purchases and sales un related from giving reviews.

				Done about 20 transactions myself over the past 8 months that I&#039;ve been a member and never had an issue.&nbsp; I prefer to read most to all of the feedback before doing business with a vendor.&nbsp; I typically try to stick to 98 to 100 rated vendors.&nbsp; Look for comments talking about stealth.&nbsp; If every other person is mentioning it then you know you&#039;re set.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m curious, because I haven&#039;t ordered here before- when it comes to amounts, anyone have a rule of thumb for keeping things less noticeable.&nbsp; For example, 1 g of MDMA is obviously safe, but is there a max you would buy?&nbsp; 5, 10 28?&nbsp;
