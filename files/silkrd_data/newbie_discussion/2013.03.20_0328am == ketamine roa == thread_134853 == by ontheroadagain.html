				I crush the crystals to fine powder before eating or insufflation.<br /><br />Remember to research doses etc. Its very dependant on body weight.<br /><br />Be safe have fun :)

				I will tell you this, do not IV ketamine.&nbsp; I have smoked, snorted, shot (IM), shot (IV), K and would not recommend ketamine IV.&nbsp; I did it once and I was unconscious before I was half done with my shot.&nbsp; A very unpleasant experience.&nbsp; IM is a very intense experience, it&#039;s like riding a wave.&nbsp; I did around 100mg (.1) and it was plenty for my first time.

				If you want to try and avoid nasal pain, k damage, put the crystal into a frying pan, add a small bit of boiled water and let it dissolve down into the liquid, then turn on the heat and slow fry, the liquid will start bubbling up and make sure it doesnt cook too quick. the liquid will eventually cook up into powder. make sure its nice and crispy, not burnt. scrape out the pan, and youve got nice warm k ready to sniff up that shnnoozer.<br />If your new to k, take a debit card or something and scrape up a corner or two and sniff, take it slow and wait until you start to feel it... then go with the flow. always best to do a little less than too much as it could put you off!<br /><br />5 yrs into ket and now IM&#039;ing, because too high tolerance for sniffing. IM is an amazing relaxing experience as long as you start small and build. Keep clean and use fresh pins.<br /><br />

				DONT EAT KETAMINE.<br />It is highly not recommended. It converts to norketamine in the stomach and can cause havoc on the insides...<br />sniff it and spit out the back drip, have lots of water after to flush out the system

				Im not sure how it could work whilst your on XCT but after a night on the K, drink some acidic drink to counteract the alkaline of the k like orange or apple juice and lots of water should help to flush it through the system...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				wow! good stuff. i found a guide on erowid that recommends eating it but i mostly want to try it for the positive effects that i&#039;ve read about. apparantly it can restore damaged synapses and at least temporarily relieve depression. sounds good for coming off mdma.<br />maybe i&#039;ll just stick with mxe, though. i know i like that one<br /><br />

				After many years of insufflating, I finally found a good source of vet grade vials.&nbsp; Intramuscular is definitely the way to go, especially if you&#039;re getting it in sealed vials.&nbsp; I guess you MIGHT find it unpleasant depending on the setting, but if you&#039;re at home experimenting you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; just remember to relax and enjoy it..&nbsp; the more you try to get up and do things, the more likely you are to vomit.
