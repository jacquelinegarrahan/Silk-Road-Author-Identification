				I&#039;m thinking of starting up my mushroom growing operation. When I last had it set up, I was harvesting fruits almost constantly. I could possibly set up a service on SR where I can send off a fresh mushroom. Doing fresh mushrooms is way different that taking them dried, in my opinion. Has anyone ever tried this? The USPS can deliver packages fairly quickly (coast to coast in 2 days), all I need to figure out is how to package them up to maintain freshness.

				i think its a great idea i love mush and can never get enough( i wanna start my own box) and noone i sell to ever has enough<br /><br />always lookin for more haha<br /><br />but theres a pretty decent sized market on SR for dried and powdered mush so i dont think youd have &#039;a lot&#039; of business but you might get some<br /><br />id suggest selling both fresh and dried (read-to-eat) if you wanted to sell!<br /><br />maybe once i get some more BTC id buy from you though haha

				yeah, 2 days is about the ma I would think without an ice pack. They&#039;ll go bad and bacteria will grow on it, and especially if the customer gets it and doesn&#039;t take it immediately and leaves them out for a couple more days....eewwww<br /><br /><br />that&#039;s pretty much the reason why dried is common and fresh isn&#039;t

				The Dutch did this for years, I dont know around 2005 we ordered fresh shrooms and it was not a problem and I dont see how it would be one now.<br />Ok you would need a steady customer base who is always buying or you will have to dry the shrooms.

				Also: I think making products like shroom chocolate or shroom honey would be nice the thing is that with the RCs now that mimic psilocybin perople could have less trust in something like the chocolate where you cant see the actual shroom.

				You&#039;d have to be growing quite a lot of mushrooms. Consider the potency difference of when eaten fresh,&nbsp; if I&#039;m not mistaken, you have to eat about ten times the amount fresh to achieve the same desired effects as however many grams dried...30 grams for every eighth...so depending on the size of your stock, you might go through it pretty quickly unless folks aren&#039;t buying in which case you&#039;re gonna want to dry them out and store them which is okay because then you&#039;ll have more in stock, and can sell for ten times the price, cause they&#039;re not 90% water anymore. (Probably why nobody else lists their mushrooms fresh). If you have enough to sell fresh, you&#039;ll probably end up selling dried stock too. I say go with both anyway, there probably is at least a small market to be filled for fresh mushrooms and currently nobody to fill it.<br /><br />Whether you decide to sell fresh or dried, i wish you the best with your venture, always good to have more mushroom vendors on the road (:<br /><br />and happy tripping!

				they would get tissue damage and get mold/mildew very quickly.&nbsp; it could lead to people getting sick if not eaten within 48 hours of being picked.&nbsp; pack them in a plastic bag and your guaranteed problems with a variety of nasty contaminants.<br /><br />not even safe to consider.<br />

				Dehydration is a tried and true method of preservation. Just sell them dried. Plus, since the weight is 80 to 90% water noobs are gonna buy them, eat a 5 gram boomer and complain that they didn&#039;t &#039;trip balls&#039;. <br />

				There&#039;s a market for fresh shrooms for sure. You&#039;d want to ship Express only, and sell an ounce at a time minimum with instruction to eat 10 times the dry weight. Cubensis lose enough potency when dried that plenty want them in a fresh state. They could be dusted with a preservative possibly (Vitamin C powder or something?) to help maintain freshness while vacuum sealed.

If the food industry can manage to ship fresh mushrooms to supermarkets, SR sellers should be able to manage shipping fresh cubensis to customers. It is possible, it&#039;s just a matter of figuring out how to do it that makes economic sense...
