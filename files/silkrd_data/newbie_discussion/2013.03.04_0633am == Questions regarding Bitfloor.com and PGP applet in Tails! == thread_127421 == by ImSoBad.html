				So I just read some reviews on nice bitcoin vendors and thought I&#039;d try bitfloor.com. Even though it was mentioned several times that people transfered their bitcoins directly from bitfloor to their SR account, to me that sounds a bit suspicious and questionable. I only say this because it seems to me that bitfloor, and any law enforcement that looks into it, could see that transfers were made from my bitfloor to a SR account. Shouldn&#039;t people be transferring through multiple bitcoin wallets or a tumbler service before transferring to their SR account<br /><br />If I do decide on bitfloor for my first bitcoin purchase, is it actually safe to directly transfer it to my SR account? Also should I access bitfloor.com through my tor browser (ice weasel on tails)? I know that you should for bitinstant and shouldnt for mt.gox so I want to be sure on how exactly I should access the site and transfer funds.<br /><br />Also for PGP encryption ( this is the most frustrating aspect for me)...how do I used it lol....<br /><br />I boot off my usb and use tails to browse and do anything SR related. I just got the newest version (0.17 or something like that) and at the top of my screen there is an icon next to my Tor Onion that says &quot;Open PGP Encryption Applet&quot;, but I&#039;m not quite sure on how to use it.<br /><br />Sorry I know that PGP is covered a lot in the forums but I&#039;ve actually had trouble finding anything that actually gave me the info I needed. <br /><br />Thanks!

				I can tell you how I go about it to message vendors. First you will need to visit the vendors seller page (the link below the price -&#039; seller:&#039;). Towards the bottom of their page you will see &#039;<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&#039;, highlight this thru the &#039;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&#039;, being careful to include all of the dashes, right click the highlighted text and copy (or ctl+c) to copy highlighted text to clipboard. Open the openpgp app. Click on the Edit/paste - this will add the vendor public key to your keyring. You can validate that it worked by clicking the &#039;other keys&#039; header. Go to applications and open accessories/gedit text editor. Enter the message you want to encrypt. Highlight all of the text (ctl+a) and then right click - copy (ctl+c) to put the info in your cliboard. Go to the openpgp app and select the second option - &#039;sign/encrypt clipboard with public key&#039;. The applet will then go to your keyring for you to select the previously entered vendor public key. This will encrypt the info currently in your clipboard. Go to the vendor page and select &#039;send a message&#039;. Enter something in the subject header. Go to the body and right click - paste (ctl+v) and you should see your encrypted text. This will allow you to send your address info to the vendor securely.<br /><br />You will need to setup your private key and post your public key at some point in time if you want someone to encrypt their message to you, but you can read up on that.
