				I have 10 free samples of Bubba Kush (0.4-0.5g), 10 free samples of High quality fishscale cocaine (0.1g), and 5 free samples of Rockstar Oil. Do I offer my free samples over the SR Forum or the SR site? Thank you :-)

				Not exactly sure how the whole vendor thing works but I suppose you should just sell them like you&#039;d sell anything else, just set the price to 0 and write that it&#039;s a sample :)<br /><br />Also you could probably create a thread for reviews.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to try the bubba kush by the way, if you ship to europe and don&#039;t mind me being a newbie.

				I would offer the samples through the forum in exchange for an review about communication/shipping/stealth/quality<br /><br />P.S. A vendorpage-link in your signature make it much easier to find you on SR<br /><br />trabsh

Go to your profile and update your signature to include links to your vendor page and later include your forum review page. You will want to have a forum review page created in the Rumor Mill section of the forums, not the newbie section.<br /><br />Then you want to create a forum post soliciting your samples for community members to see what you are offering.<br /><br />After you have found your samplers, you want to create some personalized stealth listings so each sampler engages in an SR transaction with you and you can establish feedback on both SR and on the forums. <br /><br />This is a good sampling, out of 10 samplers, hopefully you will get 4 or 5 good reviews, 2 or 3 okay ones, and a couple who just don&#039;t do what they claim they will... <br /><br />Good luck to you. If you need a review thread created message me and I can help you out.

				Thank you everyone for all your help! Once I have my page figured out to offer the samples message me there to request one? <br /><br />I have not done my research on shipping to Europe, or any other countries besides USA and Canada for that matter, so will need to do that first, but am open to shipping internationally if it&#039;s feasible that the safety risk is more or less equivalent to shipping to USA/Canada (From Canada). Any general knowledge on this? I just heard to definitely stay away from Australia lol.

				You should not give samples via the forum... do it via the main site and just charge the shipping costs. This way we can leave you feedback on the main site (most important) and reviews on the forum.<br />Setup your vendor page, and then create a a new thread on here called &quot;hydrostar review thread - free samples available&quot;. Post your vendor page there and the links to your free samples and ask that people leave feedback and reviews asap.<br />Good luck! <br />P.S. if you ship to Spain i will try and review your samples&nbsp; 8)

				You might do well to only offer these samples to people that can post in the rumor mill. I believe you can make a private listing and PM people the url.

				Yes you advertise on the forums, That you are giving away samples. Then you have a listing that is either in stealth mode and you PM people you decide (usually established members) the link to purchase the listing, Charge 0 for it and only charge for postage. <br /><br />:)Any questions feel free to ask me. Im a new vendor also. However i have been on the road for a long time.
