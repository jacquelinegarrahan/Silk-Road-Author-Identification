				Yes, the MP has been cashed. and I&#039;ve spoke with him on Torchat but he pretty much just dances around the question. first he says he has to move BTC to SR(yeterday), then he says he has to figure out the precentage @ the time i bought it. So i told him just value the BTC @ $80 USD(much lower than market rate). Still no BTC or response.

				He may just be buying time until the rates come back up (as someone pointed out above). You need to understand this, especially when dealing with him/her and deciding what to tell him/her.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say he sold a product on SR and received 2 BTC for it two weeks ago, when the rate was 1 BTC = 100$. If you had done the deal with him on the same day, he would have owed you 2 BTC.<br /><br />Now that the rate dropped to 80, he owes you 200$/80 = 2.5 BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;So he has to come up with the extra 0.5 BTC&nbsp; of his own money because the exchange rate dropped.<br /><br />To put it another way, the 2 BTC he received two weeks ago were worth 200$. Today, they are only worth 160$!<br /><br />Maybe you know all of this already, I got the impression that you may not so I am just trying to help out.&nbsp; Now that being said, you may tell him something like &#039;look, I know the&nbsp; rates have dropped but I really need the BTC immediately. Just give me (insert what you think is a fair amount here)&#039;. For example, 2 BTC or 1.9.<br /><br />In any case, this is bullshit, you should not buy from them again, even if this is the reason for the delay. This is exactly the reason why it is in&nbsp; everyone&#039;s interest to transfer the BTC ASAP after theyreceive the $. <br /><br />Right now, you have nothing in your favor because he has your money and he is being shady. My suggestion is to settle for 2.1 BTC politely, and then ream his ass when you review him so other people can be warned. In my opinion, 2 days is way too long unless his listing specifically said it could take up to 3-4 days or whatever.<br /><br /><br />

				Yea, i was going to go with JMB but he removed his listing. I&#039;ve been messaging this guy for days and he refuses to respond to me. If I dont get my money back, how can I go about making sure this doesnt happen to anyone else?

				When you go to &#039;orders&#039;, there is a link on the product you purchased that says &quot;finalize&quot;. I think that&#039;s the only way you can rate him, you would give him 1 star and write a review.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if there is anything else you can do. I am pretty new. Other people will have more input.

				I&#039;ve been using Moneyhoney, get my coins within 24 hours at least. <br />I&#039;ve had MP-BTC transactions take up to 72 hrs (longer than i prefer) but iv seen it. <br /><br />I recently had a close call with losing 1,000$ (a sketchy transaction that took me arguing with the vndor to get my coin) <br /><br />Now I always get 2 or 3 MP&#039;s and sell em for BTC seperately.

Tell him if you can at least get an ETA on your coin, and that you know the card has been cashed. <br /><br />If he fails to do so, alert SR staff, letting them know you are fully aware you are responsible for the loss seeing as you gave him the code willingly, but just tell them he&#039;s out there scamming MP&#039;s and to keep an eye on him. Then come here and slander is name, AFTER YOUV CONFIRMED HES NOT GIVING YOUR COIN. <br />Be patient and polite, but assertive and vigilant. <br /><br /><br />Good luck homie<br /><br />I recently had a close call with a vendor tell me my 800$ MP was empty, which was impossible seeing as i sent him the code literally an hour after i got it. We went back an forth, keeping the conversation somewhat civil, (i was getting a little pissed towards the end) but after establishing the fact I wouldn&#039;t just be OK with him telling me my MP was empty he told me &quot;i&#039;ll take the loss and send you the coin since im a good guy&quot;.....<br /><br />Needless to say thats the last fuckin&#039; time I deal with him.

				Never buy bitcoins on this site period. There is no way to escrow them here. The people dealing in them don&#039;t seem to understand business too well and if the price drops after you pay they don&#039;t want to send you your coins. They peace the fuck out and may get back to you, but only when the exchange rate is to their advantage. I feel like that is exactly what BitInstant is doing and maybe BST. They are gonna sit on coins right now because they would lose money otherwise. So in come the stall tactics. As soon as it is profitable again I guarantee you they will all be back selling, and you may get your orders filled. Use localbitcoins.com, they escrow your coins and the vendor can&#039;t easily screw you over. <br /><br />And DO NOT finalize it like the person above suggested. SR cannot help you if you finalize it. Hell it may be the scammer himself trying to get you to finalize. Don&#039;t do it till you have what you paid for, ever.

				Who knows, he may fill the order when the price comes back up. It&#039;s a bitch move not to fill an order after you accepted money because the price fell, but that&#039;s what almost all BTC sellers do. Everyone on here gets scammed at some point I imagine and it sucks to eat a loss. I hope he gets right with you at some point though.

There is no way to escrow them here. The people dealing in them don&#039;t seem to understand business too well and if the price drops after you pay they don&#039;t want to send you your coins. They peace the fuck out and may get back to you, but only when the exchange rate is to their advantage. I feel like that is exactly what BitInstant is doing and maybe BST. They are gonna sit on coins right now because they would lose money otherwise. So in come the stall tactics. As soon as it is profitable again I guarantee you they will all be back selling, and you may get your orders filled. Use localbitcoins.com, they escrow your coins and the vendor can&#039;t easily screw you over. <br /><br />And DO NOT finalize it like the person above suggested. SR cannot help you if you finalize it. Hell it may be the scammer himself trying to get you to finalize. Don&#039;t do it till you have what you paid for, ever.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Exactly put.&nbsp; There is no reason you should be buying coin off of the road.&nbsp; This site is not built for those kinds of transactions.&nbsp; Even on my first visit to the site and finding out I&#039;d need BTC to do anything... there was something very very very eerie about those&nbsp; BTCoffers...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to second (or possibly third, I haven&#039;t read through all of the forum postings) to use a local bitcoin exchange.&nbsp; Personally it&#039;s all I use and it DRAMATICALLY cuts down on the transaction costs of fiat currency to BTC currency.&nbsp; Depending on your reason for being on the road, this might help to make more room for your margins.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, a lot of the vendors on SR that are selling BTC seem to be miners or hoarders or both.&nbsp; This means that they are typically trying to cash out on the coins they&#039;ve come across.&nbsp; On local bitcoin exchange sites, you have a greater chance to find a trader -- i.e. someone who is simply playing margins and cares not about the rise and fall of the coin so much he/she cares about buying low and selling high.&nbsp; They definitely&nbsp; value return customers and keep a healthy habit of selling AND buying BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly I sleep a little easier.&nbsp; It saves money and it&#039;s wayyyy fucking faster because it&#039;s a simultaneous transaction that can be done in cash and in person, or over the web and hedged.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, protect yourself.<br />If you don&#039;t leave it open, they can&#039;t put it in o.o&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I assume everyone is a scammer until I can prove otherwise by research. Even then I am skeptical until I do a small transaction. My 2nd transaction here was with Tony76 who had perfect reviews on the forum and I got sold fake product. Even with proper research you can get scammed. My strategy is lots of research and small transactions. I&#039;ve done some larger transactions before...well larger for me being 500 dollars+ but that was with vendors I had history with. I don&#039;t FE either although bitcoin transactions you have no choice done through SR. <br /><br />Anyway I am wondering about Sugar Mama.
