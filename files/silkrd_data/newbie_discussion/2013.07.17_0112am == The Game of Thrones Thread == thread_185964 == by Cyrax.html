				Game of Thrones is amazing until the Red Wedding then it&#039;s a big pile of shit.<br /><br />I mean, who the fuck cares who wins now?<br /><br />The only reader/watcher-friendly character is a creepy paedeo&#039;s dragon-themed savage-raped platinum-blonde old-man&#039;s wank-fest.&nbsp; (He even surrounded her by old, flawed, paedo-minded men who JRRM didn&#039;t realise was him when he was writing them.)<br />
