				I hate the 50 posts thing. I understand it but hate none the less.. I cannot do small frequent posts.. they evolve as I type and end up as mini novels and time machines taking me hours into the future sometimes... so while I loath spammers and scammers I think if I&#039;m forced to post 50 posts before I can reply to the posts in the other forums I want to I will run out of time and keyboards!! heh so anyway the problem as I see it is the ability to create the burner accounts and make automated posts about whatever.. Usually an email activation and captcha system fixes this but the nature of these boards means that any verification or activation is a threat to security.. No good then <br /><br /><br />So really we want people to be able to post here IF they are actual SR customers and really it shouldn&#039;t mater if they have dribbled 50 times before they may have something very important to dribble this time.. but linking SR accounts to forum accounts sounds undesirable too... <br /><br />FYI my stats are;<br /><br />Total transactions: 30<br />Total spent: $4137.65<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br />yet I am afforded no respect or dignity here because of the arbitrary post count.. seems a little silly and ironic that an underground black market has such strict controls on the &#039;public&#039; forums... <br /><br />Why not have a system where after a value is reached for total spent on the SR account a button or whatever is made available that generates a code that can be used to activate 1 account here on the forums that can post where ever it wants... The code shouldn&#039;t be unique to the account generating it so not to tie anything together but that way you ensure that the people who post in the forums have actually purchased something and therefor are less likely to be up to no good.It could even be extended to say if I purchase from vendor A and want to post a review in the forums for them then I must use a code generated for that purchase.. maybe not the second one yet but the first idea is a winner...<br /><br />what are the thoughts of any others out there... <br /><br />although please can we limit the thoughts expressed here to ones that have merit and not dreamed up between periods at high school? <br /><br />And maybe the ones that feel I&#039;m a genius could be expressed first and most often?<br /><br />Apart from that though... ideas?<br /><br /><br />;-p

				Spam.<br /><br />Only kidding, but unfortunately you will probably have to spam like the rest of us to get 50 posts. If each of your messages is like that then you will never get there. Once you are out of this god forsaken place, you should bring it up in one of the active forums where it is more likely to be read by someone who can do something about it. <br />In my opinion, the post count should be reduced to 10 and you should not be allowed to spam to reach it. As for your idea, it does sound nice. I would guess however that both the forums and the real site are on completely different servers, this would make it very hard to implement what you are suggesting. Perhaps the idea is flawed though, just 1 confirmed purchased is enough to demonstrate you are valuable to the community.

				Made it eventually... It was a while back and happened quicker than I thought it would TBH and then couldn&#039;t remember what threads I wanted to reply too and so&nbsp; my posts have slowed again. Meh I am always upset when restrictions are placed on me and seem to see it as a personal challenge to meet and exceed the requirements to have them removed.. then don&#039;t understand what all my fussing was about and get bored then distracted by another &#039;mission&#039;.

				How do these bots verify themselves?<br />Anyway, I think there should be a timer on how often an account can create a topic (assuming there isn&#039;t one already) like once every 10 minutes or so.

				A timer seems like an easy thing for a bot or spammer to over come. The initial wait would suck but by creating accounts systematically over the time you are waiting it would eventually get to the stage where you would have a pool of &#039;aged&#039; accounts and so long as you created a new one every time you burned one you wouldn&#039;t have any gaps.<br /><br />Surprisingly, now I have my posts up, I find my indignation towards the state of affairs regarding the post count requirement and sympathy for the newbies still working at it has waned significantly...&nbsp; Well... What can I say? I figure if I&#039;m going to dribble shit... I may as well dribble the best shit I possibly can and for as long as I can so took the 50 posts this as carte blanche within these padded walls called the Newbie section and got down to the posting of my thoughts/gripes etc.<br /><br />The OP got almost no replies for ages.. lol. seems like a contextual error or something... to me anyway.

				Yeah, I hear ya, the 50 post limit is a bit silly. Though even if you changed it to 10 and made a no spam rules, you would still have just silly pointless responses to threads, almost like this one ;)

				If it&#039;s the way they want to do it, then let it be.<br /><br />Seems kinda silly that we&#039;re forced to spam to 50 posts whereas most forums don&#039;t even let you spam xD.

				Yes, I think the 50 post hurdle is too high. I think it should be reduced, the system proposed in the first post sounds quite reasonable.
