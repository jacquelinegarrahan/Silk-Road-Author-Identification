				Hi,<br /><br />I need some advice regarding an LSD purchase.<br /><br />I bought this: 5 LSD blotters rated at 150mcg from The Flying Dutchman.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e6dbb529bd<br /><br />The purchase arrived.. but the item was not on perforated blotter paper. So it wasn&#039;t split up into doses. I contacted the vendor and he apologised, told me that I could cut it up with scissors and offered an extra 2 tabs with my next order... well... ok.<br /><br />However... the blotter that arrived measured 6cm by 5cm. From the few LSD purchases I&#039;ve had from other vendors the tabs are quite small - there would be a lot more than 5 on a 6cm x 5cm sheet. <br /><br />I&#039;m concerned that the wrong order might have been sent and there are more than 5 x 150mcg doses on the sheet (the vendor also sells 10x 25x 50x) . If I cut it up into 5 pieces then I&#039;ll be getting much larger dose than anticipated.<br /><br />I&#039;ve re-messaged the vendor again to see if I can get some confirmation/information, but have had no response as yet.<br /><br />Does anyone have any advice?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />

				It&#039;s also possible your blotters are not LSD but -Nbome etc. This especially since the tabs are bigger than normally.

				Start small, boy... Why don&#039;t you simply test small piece and redose till desired effect?<br /><br />-nBome: Swallow them - if it kicks in, it&#039;s Acid - if not you had a RC

				I just received my blotters from the same vendor. 1 tab is about 8x8mm, so if your measurements are correct and you were sent real LSD - Flying Dutchman has always sent me the real stuff - you are holding about 50 doses.<br />Swallowing works fine, it&#039;ll take up to 2 hours to kick in then.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I wouldn&#039;t say it is nbome because the sheet is larger, I haven&#039;t found nbome blotters to be much larger than acid.<br />8x8 sounds about right, I would cut them into tabs that size, take one and see what happens. Not the most efficient way to go about it if you were looking forward to setting some time aside for it and don&#039;t get the chance to take it very often, but it&#039;s the best option you have. That or get a test kit and find out for yourself.

				Real LSD should take effect within an hour, 5-MEO-AMT on the other hand takes 2 hours and lasts alot longer than real LSD, so this may help you figure out what you are taking. You can use a ehrlich test to see if either LSD or AMT and not anything else, but they are both indoles and therefore a ehrlich test will not discern between them, you will have to use a marquis test afterwards to determine if its real LSD. In any case real acid is very hard to make and after all that risk and effort they are not just going to drop them onto a piece of computer paper. If it looks sketch, it probably is.
