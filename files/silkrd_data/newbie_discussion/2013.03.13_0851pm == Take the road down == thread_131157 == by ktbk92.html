				What would be the point of having a top secret Uber weapon if you don&#039;t use it until it&#039;s outdated? If LE could shut down SR, they would. However, they don&#039;t have the manpower/talent to overcome the manpower/talent of the SR staff (for now). Look at how successful the bit torrent system has been, and that&#039;s far less secure and far more widely distributed than SR (and record companies have way more money than the federal government). I&#039;m not saying that SR is immortal, but as long as it&#039;s still running, it hasn&#039;t been compromised yet.

				I think you seriously overestimate the government, and overestimate this so called &quot;war on drugs&#039;.&nbsp; The system is about money, they&nbsp; don&#039;t to stop the drug trade, they want to tax it.&nbsp; That&#039;s what the entire system is about, cops, lawyers, and judges are all just there to get a piece.

				The SR has been around for a while now I think if any government could take it down they would of done so by now, there is a video of a NY senator talking about the SR and actually browsing around on here so obviously the most powerful government in the world knows about it I think they just cant take it down

				The difference is that it is not in anybody&#039;s face. If Newtown CT had happened with guns purchased from the Armory we would see a much different attitude towards it.<br /><br />The moral majority (are they still a majority) for the most part would not be able to figure out how to get into the site. The DEA is aware, but with finite resources and limited ability I am not too worried about the site going anywhere.<br /><br />Now if somebody sells a bunch of poison to kids and it is known that they all got it from SR then there may be a push to do something. Or the people selling whole keys of heroin here, that may get the heat after you but unlike on the street where it is easier to bust the user selling rocks to support their habit the reward for busting somebody selling five OC&#039;s at a time just isn&#039;t there.

				It is more likely that the state attack will be upon BTC, not SR directly.&nbsp; But trying to regulate BTC is challenging as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am glad that SR is only drugs now and not weapons.&nbsp; The right to bear arms is important, but one glance at the TV these days will tell you where the state and their corporate minions are concentrating their efforts.&nbsp; I would be much less comfortable doing business on SR if illegal arms sales were normal here.<br /><br />A small amount of efficient drug economy is not a very real threat to the state.&nbsp; The US makes so many black dollars on our dope they are laughing all the way to the bank.&nbsp; Do some reading and you will quickly realize this is how it has worked for some time now.&nbsp; Sure, they play both sides of the prohibition market, but busting poor people IRL is much more profitable for the prison complex than spending more time on less return by trying to bust smart SR users.<br /><br />A large amount of untaxed currency is definitely a potential threat to the state.&nbsp; <br /><br />An unregulated arms market of any scale will always be a threat to the state.

				If &quot;they&quot; could break SR - so it did not work anymore -, I think they would save that trick for something more important. Once they use a trick like that, the international IT community would probably learn to adapt and the trick would not be as effective anymore.<br /><br />If they could infiltrate and read all private data in SR, I think they would want to use that info to support local LE to bust people while trying not to let the source of their intel be known. That would be expensive to do, so I think they would pick and choose cases and their favorite LE to cooperate with. I think they would try not to let SR know what they were doing/that it was compromised.<br /><br />If they can&#039;t do shit, I think they will talk big about a war on ... and act like they are making a big difference fighting... and mistreat those they do catch to make themselves feel better about their many failures and general inadequacy. Sadly they will use the whole fiasco to enrich the wealthy and politically backward elements of society in a variety of ways.&nbsp; -End Rant, NWN

				I read an article about a FOIA request that pretty well proved they would come after SR...but they can&#039;t. They were given a lead on some exploitation or another (cp I&#039;m sure) and, in their own words -&nbsp; &quot;there is not currently a way to trace the origin of the website.

				I don&#039;t think LE (American or International) has the technology to &quot;shutdown&quot; SR, as long as we all just continue to be smart about using the Marketplace, I.e. using pgp encryptions and buying BTC anonymously, then LE should lose some interest in busting the end user of SR products. Now as for the big time vendors and resellers, I can&#039;t say if LE has interest in taking you guys down. Oh well legal recreational use of MJ in all 50 states is right around the corner methinks.

				So in doing my due diligence about the road, I ask a IT professional &quot;stoner&quot; about the safety and anonymity of the site and his thoughts on if the Man can take it down, or selectively take certain players down. His response was that if they want you, &quot;they&quot; can get you. Then he tells me that a relative of his works for the nsf and says that they are storing all the &quot;data&quot; for a later date. He says that someday they will be able to prosecute and take it down. Now take into consideration that the guy snapped 5 bong rips in about 30 mins, but he is no rookie. I look at it this way, if you keep it on the DL and don&#039;t go Tony Montano on the site and stay on top of your stealth, your safer than hustling on the street. I&#039;m more concerned about scammers than LE so far...
