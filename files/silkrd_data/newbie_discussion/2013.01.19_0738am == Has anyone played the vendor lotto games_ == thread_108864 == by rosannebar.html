				I imagine people must win once in a while. <br /><br />I actually haven&#039;t looked into that. How much are they and what can you win.

				I have a couple on there on my Vendor&#039;s account and they&#039;re both legit.<br /><br />One of them is a lotto which uses a system I designed myself that is verifiable by the players when it&#039;s finished but it needs all 255 places to be taken so it&#039;s gonna be a long wait!<br /><br />The other is a random one based on transaction IDs but I looked at the odds for some of these (I&#039;m a computer scientist and work a lot with stats) and to be honest, the odds people put on their lotto games are a little exaggerated.<br /><br />STILL we all get that spare change thats useless really, may as well have a go. (Unless you just let that odd bit add up to a lot! lol)

				I think you&#039;d all be better off leaving the lottos alone. It is gambling with ridiculous odds and when I saw it as a vendor I thought why the hell not. I actually feel a little bad having lottos on there.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I made my prizes so high so that at least winners got something awesome.<br /><br />BL<br />
