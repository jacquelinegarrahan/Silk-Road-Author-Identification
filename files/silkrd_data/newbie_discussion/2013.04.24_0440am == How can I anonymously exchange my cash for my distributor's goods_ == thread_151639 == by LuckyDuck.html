				I opened a vendor account on SR (obviously, NOT under the name &quot;LuckyDuck&quot;) and will be selling pot. The pot is grown by a friend of a friend, lets call him &quot;Doug.&quot;<br /><br />The beauty is that I have never met Doug and Doug has never met me. Our mutual friend, whom I would trust with my life, has vouched for both of us being honest&nbsp; people. Doug is motivated to work in larger quantities, lacks the interest and technical skill to manage SR, and would be delighted to have me take a pound at a time rather than him selling in small increments and taking big risks.<br /><br />To keep this safe, it&#039;s best that Doug never learn my identity or location, and vice-versa.<br /><br />An idea I came up with was to park my car someplace, say, &quot;Location A&quot; at say, noon. Doug would come by at 1 o&#039;clock, open the trunk, remove the bag of cash, and place the bag of product. But things could go wrong. Someone who knows me could dash out to confront Doug about breaking into my car. Moreover, Doug would then have my license plate number.<br /><br />SO, VENDORS -- HOW DO YOU ANONYMOUSLY EXCHANGE GOODS FOR CASH?<br />

				Why don&#039;t you have him open a bit coin wallet , not necessarily on SR and then transfer the bit coins? You could then have your mutual friend, if he&#039;s willing, middle the hand off. You might have to compensate him but maybe the dealer would split your friends commission.<br /><br />Or, you could stick with your dead drop idea, just don&#039;t use the car. I&#039;ve actually left stuff above a droppede ceiling in a public restroom for people. You need a bathroom that has a lock so one person atr a time only can use it.And, time it right so it&#039;s not siting too long, nighttime is better as there is less chance of some kind of repairman like an electrician or plumber probably wouldn&#039;t be fucking around up there. Usually Dunkin Dognuts have these types of bathrooms.<br /><br />Better yet, either money gram it to him , you might both need fake ID&#039;s for that, &#039;m not sure,or have him get a money pack and you could load that for him .

				Thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />Regarding having Doug open a bitcoin wallet: out of the question. He lacks technical skill and wants nothing to do with computers.<br /><br />Your bathroom idea is nice, but more nefarious than I was looking for.<br /><br />I had a similar idea which was to use the locker at my gym. I could come in, prepare for my workout, and leave an envelope with cash in the locker, and lock it. He would arrive at a later time, open the locker, remove the cash and deposit the goods. Trouble is, he doesn&#039;t want to open a membership at my gym.<br /><br />I figure this is a problem vendors have face many times, so I&#039;m eager to hear advice from others.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				You suggested using your car to do the swap. Why not borrow someone elses car? Preferably not a close relatives.<br /><br />Or you could both send representatives to meet keeping you out of it?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there is a really simple solution&nbsp; :o

				Interesting suggestion, Quantum. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to involve *any* parties other than myself and Doug. After introducing us, our mutual friend wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thought:<br /><br />At the complex where I live, each resident does not have a mailbox near the door; instead, there&#039;s a mailbox &quot;pod&quot;. Each resident has a key to his or her box.<br /><br />From my condo, the &quot;pod&quot; is not visible. So Doug could maintain his anonymity.<br /><br />There are so many people living here, that if I saw a stranger standing and unlocking the box, I would think nothing of it. <br /><br />Mail delivery always takes place by 6 pm. So we could make a rule that our exchange time is after 7 pm. <br /><br />So, I&#039;d place the envelope with cash in my mailbox, on the agreed-upon date at 7:00 pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doug would come by after that and make the exchange.<br /><br />What do y&#039;all think of this?<br /><br />:)<br />

				Aren&#039;t these all the same basic idea? <br /><br />What&#039;s most important here? <br /><br />He wants to never meet you/you never want to meet him? <br />You obviously want to leave your cash and him leave the pot in something secure.<br /><br />At the gym, you&#039;d both presumably be on video coming in the front door. Any of these places could be surveilled in other ways, yeah? <br /><br />I personally like the gym idea to some extent. Would he need a membership? Did you have to register for your locker?

One thing to consider, is generating a pattern. The Public is very keen on strange behavior. When people follow the traditional system of corner dealing, there is a recognizable pattern that is 1) atypical behavior 2) predictable.<br /><br />If you are located in one place, selling drugs, then you are a red flag. In the conventional narcotic enterprise, this is the drill. Stand in one place, have a few guards, a look out, and it&#039;s on. It takes care of marketing: word of mouth + open-air sales. Security is already intertwined with this approach, but it still leaves a world of hurt: rival gangs and LEO harassment.<br /><br />Even if you are two people making harmless Cannabis exchanges, if it looks suspicious to a nosy neighbor, then it is a dangerous risk to business. These are your finances at risk--retirement, charity, food, shelter, rent, etc. Your livelihood is at stake by Capture Troopers. Live a normal life, and your life will be normal.

Answer:<br />1. ANONYMITY.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The MOST important thing is for me to NEVER know who Doug is. My assumption is --correct me if I&#039;m wrong --since Doug is selling in bigger quantities than me, LE might offer me a deal to turn HIM in; but they would be less likely to offer him a deal to turn ME in. IS THAT TRUE?<br /><br />2. SECURITY.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a. Not being noticed or becoming suspect in any way <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Not developing a pattern<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;c. Not getting ripped off by others<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE: we are small-timers. Doug currently ONLY sells to personal friends of his.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do NOT have huge ambitions. We simply want to feel safe that, if I put a quantity of cash in an<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; envelope, it ends up in Doug&#039;s hands, not someone else&#039;s.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PerpetualMotion&gt; Even if you are two people making harmless Cannabis exchanges, if it looks suspicious to a nosy neighbor, then it is a dangerous risk to business. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>THANKS for the reminder. Using the &quot;pod&quot; just got ruled out.<br /><br />I thought of using lockers at a hotel or bus station, but again, cameras, patterns, etc. A lockable box in a remote yet public place is appealing, but I&#039;d like Doug to minimize time spent in his car with the goods.<br /><br />In fact, Doug&#039;s biggest reservation is that he has to leave his house with the goods. Whereas with his current scheme, he doesn&#039;t leave the house; buyers are coming to him. He&#039;s looking for an alternative because of the obvious and HUGE risks he is currently taking.<br /><br />THANKS for the stimulating &amp; interesting replies. I know I&#039;m on the right track, but the final solution will be dead simple, I&#039;m sure.<br />&nbsp;:)<br />

				Okay, I&#039;ve done some more thinking and have a suggestion.<br /><br />Where has public lockers other than a private gym that requires membership? Say a bus or train station? A locker where you can put the cash and take the key with you. Then you can stash the key some place your supplier can find it to do the trade and leave the key back?<br /><br />It would be much easier to hide a locker key than stash n&#039; cash.<br /><br />&nbsp;:P

				DQ - nice! Yeah, I&#039;ve been looking all over for rentable public lockers. I don&#039;t like bus stations or train stations though, as I see cameras everywhere, and those are designed for one-time use. It would look abnormal to visit and re-visit a locker at a bus station. Whereas in a gym, it&#039;s absolutely the norm to visit and re-visit the gym, and to lock your things up each time. And no one is tracking which locker you used. Securely emailing one another with only one item -- the locker number -- would suffice.<br /><br />Instead of hiding keys, both parties would simply have a copy of the key.<br /><br />Anyone have other suggetions for public lockers?&nbsp; The gym is ideal, except for the membership part.

				Perhaps a more refined version of Tessellated&#039;s idea sounds good. If you want to avoid CCTV altogether you need to get out of the city and look out in the wide open spaces of the countryside.<br /><br />Christ, there&#039;s loads of hiding places out in the wilds. Ever see The Shawshank Redemption? You need a locking cash box, buried near a wall close to a tree. Yup, thats it.
