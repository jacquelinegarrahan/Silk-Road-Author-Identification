				Well, I&#039;m pretty new too and here&#039;s how I did it. First, you gotta get bitcoins. I used a website called btcquick.com because they will take credit cards but it&#039;s not the best exhange rate and you can them lots of other places. Then use blockchain.info and get a free wallet. When you get your digital bitcoin certificate from whomever you bought it from (my guy emails me with a link to download pdf files with the certificates on them). Take the &quot;private key&quot; number, copy it and import it into your blockchain wallet. Then you take the silkroad payment number (listed in the &quot;Account&quot; link of your Silk Road profile) and enter it into the &quot;send bitcoins&quot; area in your blockchain wallet. Within an hour or two, your bitcoins will be in your SR account. Does that make sense?

				I made my first Bitcoin deposit into SR using Bitinstant transfered into a MtGox account and then transferred my Bitcoins into&nbsp; my SR account Bitcoin address.&nbsp; Opening a Mt Gox account took about an hour or so because they want you to scan your Id and send it to them through a PDF file.&nbsp; Anyway my Bitcoins were in my SR account in about two hours.&nbsp; I don&#039;t worry about being annonymous because Bitcoin transactions are nearly imposible to trace what you spent them on.

				Oh, and also just have the package sent to your address and never sign for the package.&nbsp; In the rare event that LE asked you any questions just play dumb like, I have never ordered any drugs and don&#039;t answer any more of LE questions.&nbsp; You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney to speak on your behalf.&nbsp; Just because someone mails you drugs does not make you guilty of a crime.
