				Yeah I was almost set on XTCEXPRESS but I got the paranoia and went for a higher price and a sounder mind. It&#039;s better quality and lower price than I&#039;ve ever gotten from the streets, so I&#039;m happy. ;)<br />

				I did try to buy here because i am now 40 + , saw the beginnings of the rave scene &amp; electronic music , but i m not anymore in the drug buisness community .So i did try to do my first orders here to have quality stuff with an average price.... i m not into a particular drug , i didnt try all existing drugs yet ...and there&#039;s plenty of great stuff here ^^<br />I obviously love MDMA , Amphetamins, lsd , k , 2 c family , some opiates sometimes ..... well basically everything nature &amp; gifted chemists have to share with us !!<br />Not so much into the new &#039;legal&#039; highs or new chemicals because we don&#039;t have a big overview on health problems &amp; long time use .... except whats written on Erowid website.<br />I also trust that were safer buying here ( if not scammed lol ) than staying on the streets looking for dope ... yes i m a fuckin&#039; paranoid.

				I&#039;m here because I&#039;m a geek who likes drugs... and SR merges those two things very nicely. Also I like ordering things online if possible, ordering online is like buying from a shop but you have the whole world standing there letting you know how good or bad the products are. <br /><br />Mainly I just like being able to order quality stuff instead of getting questionable stuff from dealers for about the same price (the ketamine I&#039;ve been buying from here costs the same per gram as the street stuff, and the street stuff is cut to fuck).

				Only smoke weed (and bho) that i grew &amp; the same goes for mushrooms. I am currently here looking for reagents for my chemical explorations. Lithium Aluminum Hydride is my #1 goal but i will accept other reducing agents etc. I may also procure a few liters of safrole for my chemical explorations as well.

				I&#039;m looking for things I can&#039;t get elsewhere, some of the rare yet illegal compounds, also that s-iso ket, beautiful stuff<br />I can&#039;t really be arsed with the weed, the mandy, the acid (having said that, I want a couple of these ultra strong tabs, just for the collection like!), the common as muck RC&#039;s and these fancy pharm opis (way too expensive). I can get the same thing half the price elsewhere<br />However the purity of some things on here are unmatched as to what I can get on the street, like coke, haven&#039;t ordered any yet but when I do, it&#039;s gonna be the best of the best. something I could only dream of before i found SR<br />I&#039;m always on the lookout for those unicorns, scouring the marketplace for something a bit special, something a bit obscure.<br />Also even though I can get MXE much cheaper elsewhere, the quality i get from the road is unmatched, tempted to say even better than pre-ban<br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE message me if you find that diamond in the rough, christ i&#039;ll even send some btc your way!!<br />And the speed here is bang on, got some to use up my btc and it&#039;s just out of this world, give it a go!
