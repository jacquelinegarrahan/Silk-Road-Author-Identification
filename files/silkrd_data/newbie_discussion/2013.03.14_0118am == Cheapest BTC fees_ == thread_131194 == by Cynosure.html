				I put in $630 which I figured would be more than enough for my $573 worth of orders.&nbsp; After buying my bitcoins, transferring them through Blockchain, and then to SR, I only had about $560 in my account.&nbsp; $70 seems like a high % of taken BTC in fees and such.<br /><br />I used Bitfloor and ended up losing like .004 bitcoints in each of my three Blockchain accounts.<br /><br />Are there any cheaper ways to do this or is that the norm?

				I usually use Bitinstant (Pricey though), but just made my first purchase through Coinbase. The fee&#039;s are very modest, though it takes a little time to receive your coins. I bought some yesterday, and they&#039;re supposed to be in my account on Monday the 18th.

				I have found Bitfloor to be cheaper than Bitinstant and actually more efficient.&nbsp; Make sure you mix your BTC on the way no matter how you do it.<br /><br />The good drugs on SR are also more expensive than the less-good drugs IRL, and they come to your door with less risk.<br /><br />Time is valuable. Security is valuable.&nbsp; Do the math on it and choose wisely.&nbsp; SR represents an efficient market, like it or not.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t, try cold calling the corner boys nearest to you and you may change your mind!

				&nbsp;8)<br /><br />I&#039;m not bashing the legitimacy, efficiency, or security of the Silk Road.&nbsp; I was just checking to see if there were any cheaper options.&nbsp; The $70 just seemed a bit steep.. that&#039;s over 10% in fees.<br /><br />But, it seems it&#039;s the best way.. so I&#039;ll keep doing it!

				Ahh... see, that&#039;s quite a bit cheaper.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t use them because they have been down every time I&#039;ve wanted to order some coins.. and when they finally came back up they had gotten rid of the direct address option.

				With BitcoinsUK not only do we offer the lowest fees (and if you become a member, you actually get your coins for UNDER market value) of just 20p above market rate per coin, but the only other charge you incur with us is the cost of postage - it must be recorded with tracking.<br /><br />Depending on your stats you will either get a portion of or all the amount you are after as soon as the deal is agreed, and we transfer coins via your username, so not only do they show up practically instantly, but you have no worries about blockchain or anything like that :)<br /><br />Currently we&#039;re redoing the profile and options, it&#039;s a bit too...messy and confusing it would seem. Changing our label to currency converter instead of bitcoin trader is our main bit..for those people who got the rest of their coins upon cash arrival, they expected the same rate as the previous night, which as anyone following the prices recently will attest to, would end up costing me a small fortune with a big enough order.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a member with decent stats (3 months minimum membership and a good amount of buys will get you a £50 &quot;up front&quot; credit for instance, but those with 9-12months and large purchases can get up to £150 up front on their first purchase - and if membership is bought, from just the second purchase you are likely to get all the coins straight away..again depending on stats)<br /><br />So if you&#039;re after BTC in the UK give us a try :)
