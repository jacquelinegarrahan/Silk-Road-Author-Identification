				A lot of people here seem to have PO&#039;s or order poste restante, but now in Finland they&#039;re making both harder. I was wondering if anybody has insight on whether or not it&#039;s intelligent to order to your own home address with your own name.

				Weather you pick up a pack in our name or someone else&#039;s, if they want you they are going to get you. With the fake name LE has the option for additional charges of criminal impersonation.

				The idea behind sr is to make mail look like any other mail you would get. If you all of the sudden receive mail for a name they have never heard it will raise suspicion.

				In the UK, you can use a false name with zero risk. The postal service do not know the names of all the people living in a house, you can address to &quot;The Easter Bunny&quot; and it will still come through the letterbox.<br />House number, street, postcode. This is what a postman looks at.&nbsp; <br />The top line is irrelevant. How the fuck does he know who&#039;s living in my house?<br /><br />People in the US say this isn&#039;t the case for them, for some reason. But here in the UK, you can use whatever name you like.<br />If you&#039;re super paranoid, you can leave the item in the hall for a few days with &quot;return to sender&quot; written on it. So that if by some miracle LE do pay a visit, you have your plausable denial all ready to go.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used my home address a few times when a drop isn&#039;t available, each time with a random name, and each time it arrives no problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suggest that you send yourself some test letters, all with different names, to see if they get through. No idea how things work in Finland, but I see no reason at all why a false name is a risk.

				If you order to someone elses name and it doesnt get delivered then if you complain vendors will think you&#039;re trying to scam them and will blacklist you. Best just to order honestly then if it gets flagged, deny deny deny. (write &quot;return to sender&quot; on box and dont open it immediately)

But I might just be wrong. To be sure, I think I&#039;ll order honestly like SRSuperfly said I should, because I can just claim I don&#039;t use any. There&#039;s no proof of use on my computer, and all transactions I&#039;ll make will be by bitcoin so they can&#039;t prove anything. But thanks for the help anyways!

				we are all cary paranoid.<br /><br />We just think LE are always looking to us...FALSE!<br /><br />they are lazy, and is impossible to get problem as long as you deny deny.<br /><br />anyone can send you box with guns or stuff.<br /><br />even if you buy from mtgox and you directly send coins to sr account, you can always say that you made an investiment like stock trading.<br /><br />be positive, relaxed and busy, and everything will be fine.

				I live in the UK and order in my real name and address. Done 12 orders now without any problems or any fear of being caught. If a parcel came for me and it was too big for the letterbox and I had to pick it up at the Post Office they would demand ID and if it was in a false name they wouldn&#039;t give me it.

				i&#039;m kinda under the impression that if you&#039;re not ordering huge quantities of shit for resale, you should be ok.&nbsp; i mean, what&#039;s the point of le going through a huge investigation just to bust some end user with a small amount of contraband.&nbsp; in my case, anything i order would result in a first offense possesion charge that would most likely be dropped or pled down or something.&nbsp; just never make it worth it for them to bust you.
