				&nbsp; &nbsp;Agree wholeheartedly. Aussie users need to start operating as a secure, cohesive community with at least one unifying goal: Keeping Aus leo as ignorant of our doings as is humanly possible. Nobody&#039;s ordering 50 grams of MDMA to Afghanistan, and everyone knows which country is &quot;the hardest to get gear into&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Our security apparatus is far from ignorant, and we&#039;re increasingly learning about the immense abilities they have to profile and monitor every aspect of an individual&#039;s life. Let&#039;s fight back, not make it easier for them to press the case for a heavy focus on Aussie SR users.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i understand you mite think your doing your fellow Aussie a favour in convincing him to shop with a certain vendor but your NOT! if you have a question just ask the vendor?? He may not give you 100% accurate advice but its the risk you take! look at feedback and check there refund/reship policy if they have confidence in there stealth there policy will reflect it. And NEVER EVER FE!!!! I recently got burnt and outed $300 because i thought a vendor was a nice guy! Feel like the biggest moron but hey i guess i learnt the hard way... Unfortunately its the fly by&#039;s that are posting they received it from Aus not your longtime Shoppers that scroll thru the forums for useful info...DPR Needs to get in on this and post it on the main site because if the Aus market goes down i think its safe to say we accommodate a big chunk of buyers out there...
