				I&#039;ve been playing this game for quite sometime now but now it has entered uncharted waters. Before the road, the longest I would wait was maybe a day or two to receive the goods but now it&#039;s several days to a week at a time. I find myself getting very anxious and impatient.

				I agree the waiting is tough, you could try to order smaller<br />orders several times a month or just order more in<br />general!&nbsp; Could get expensive tho!<br />Luck to you!

				You have no idea! I posted my first order (try waiting on smack!) four days ago... two days in I wasn&#039;t sure that I did everything right so I sent the vendor a message (encrypted) just letting him know I was new and if I did anything wrong to let me know, otherwise ignore the message. The guy got so pissed that he sent a diatribe about not having time for messages and cancelled my order (this was a VERY reputable vendor)... I was SO pissed... not only had he taken four days to mark the package in transit... he just cancelled the damn thing after waiting more than half a week. Just today I changed my order to a new vendor and I&#039;m STILL staring at that &#039;in processing&#039; crap. Can&#039;t wait to just get some freaking product! I&#039;m trying to be as good a customer as I can and this crap is driving me nuts! I remember the anxiety waiting for pot... but smack is just TERRIBLE. I can&#039;t stop refreshing!

				I ran out of weed yesterday and finally stuck an order in this morning. However I was on the verges of ordering earlier in the week on Tuesday, and gutted I didn&#039;t, but I had terrible toothache and abscesses that I couldn&#039;t even bring myself to look at the computer screen I was in that much pain! Now I&#039;m also going to have to wait a few days sober instead of having some there for when I run out.<br />

				I spent some time buying from different vendors and made a mistake. I had several incoming orders for the same thing from different vendors. One didn&#039;t show. I didn&#039;t know who it was to contact. <br /><br />May want to keep that in mind for regular buyers .

With some venders it might take more time to get the goods than with others. If your order does not come in a month that&#039;s when you need to start worrying.

				If your able, try and figure out how much you smoke and get ahead of yourself.&nbsp; I smoke about a gram a day of weed or a .25g of oil a day.<br /><br />If your a daily smoker, smoking weed will only do you for so long, eventually you will need to go concentrates.<br /><br />1g of oil lasts me longer than an 8th and gets me higher too, both average about $60<br /><br />I&#039;ve been smoking since I was a teenager, when I got older learned that the plant part of pot was useless and all the active ingredients are in trichome heads protruding from the leaves so I began to only smoke hash or oil. <br /><br />Concentrates are much more efficient and easier to transport.&nbsp; I just have to put like .2g of oil in my vape and after 1 relatively smokeless hit I am so high I feel like a teenager again.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vapes have a bit of a learning curve if you&#039;ve never used one but they are the best way.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Good tip, thanks! <br /><br />I would assume that if SR goes down vendors will be sitting on a lot of product that they can no longer move as quickly. So they would probably still operate under tormail. Ohwell, i dont like talking about doomsday situations. Makes me panic and want to stock up on sweet, sweet drugs.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />What do you guys think about the going concern of Silk Road? The site has gained massive profile lately. A few of my friends were hanging around and talking about drugs they couldn&#039;t get. All I said was sure, I can get it for you. They were both like Oh, so you&#039;re on Silk Road. Like separately three people in the room new all about it, one using it. Is it&#039;s growing fame a concern to it&#039;s existence? I don&#039;t know how the regulation of the deep web goes on.

The more people who know, the more people who will be using TOR. Right now one of the biggest flaws in some areas of the world is that only people using SR for illegal purposes are using TOR. If more people hear about SR, and the &quot;deepweb&quot; (I hate that term) as a whole, then it will better anonymize the rest of us. One negative, however, is that it may lead to laws being drafted making the use of TOR illegal, but I do not see that happening anytime soon. As someone in another thread (I can&#039;t remember where I read it! If anyone know who to cite, feel free!) stated TOR is of more benefit than hindrance to the powers that be (due to global political instability in the mideast/Africa and censorship in nations such as North Korea and China). A more realistic and probable negative outcome of increased attention is that there may be an influx of new vendors and buyers who are not as legitimate as the current and older group. If all of us users make it our duty to inform the new and ignorant of any errors in their processes and actively promote safer, more anonymous internet use then there is room for all of us to flourish along the Silk Road.

				I think the waiting game is what we are all in it for.&nbsp; I have waited for almost every kind of drug there is (excluding speed. I am not a stimulants guy, I am a downers guy.)&nbsp; And I think the wait is the game. Every time, the thought of how great its going to be when I finally get what I have been waiting so diligently for, is what makes it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The drug is never as good as the wait, or as good as finally getting it.&nbsp; Some of you will understand, but some won&#039;t.&nbsp; Embrace the game, its all about the wait.

Any flood of new vendors or buyers could be easily handled by SR raising the price on a vendor account (charging would-be vendors $2k just for the honor of a booth would help weed out any non-professionals) or raising the bar for membership (no joining without an SR password, which could be PGP encrypted and regularly changed, say, or no joining without first paying the site one Bitcoin - refundable after your first order - or making a smaller, nonrefundable SR donation). Personally, I do wish the bar to entry were a little higher. If you couldn&#039;t join the site and forums without first demonstrating that you knew how to use PGP and that you&#039;d already set up a BTC wallet and were comfortable making purchases with it, it would enhance security and save the vendors time. <br /><br />On the other hand, everyone starts somewhere, and as you wrote, there&#039;s room enough for all. <br /><br />
