				I am considered a newbie, though I used to be fairly active on SR as a buyer in previous years. As a way to contribute a bit while consequently spamming up my post count, I would like to make this thread the place in the newbie section where everyone discusses everything. This can be very beneficial - many threads are skipped over because they seem unimportant to answer, but having posts in a thread can make it easier for those with the answer to speak up. Hopefully we can get a few helpful members checking the thread out too!<br /><br />Make sure to include a bitcoin address in your post to have a chance to randomly receive free coins. The amount will vary, some will get more and others will get less. I plan to provide a bigger prize to the next person to post after my 50th post, which will take place in this thread as long as it remains active.<br /><br />Have any questions? Comments? Something random to say? Lets get this started!

				I should also point out, instead of having get someones wallet address, you can just use gift codes.&nbsp; It&#039;s very easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Make it any amount you want and you can message them to anyone at will.<br /><br />Of course, they will have to spend it in SR, but I don&#039;t anyone will mind.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t attach it to a specific vendor.&nbsp;

				I heard about this new rule a bit ago and have not wanted to come to the forum since.&nbsp; In fact I spoke up against this idea when it was proposed in it&#039;s very own thread by some asshole who&#039;s name I cannot remember right now.&nbsp; I do not feel like checking my old posts to see who but you all should feel free to do so and then be sure to give him some hell.&nbsp; I have been staff too many forums to count on one hand or to remember in this fried up skull at the current moment.&nbsp; Really just stopped in to bitch about this for a precise topic for a minute before making the call to either abandon the forum or start on something productive here... I have not yet decided in which direction I want to go with it... currently killing time while the road will not seem to load.<br /><br />Anyone who posted here happen to notice anything about their wallet?&nbsp; Larger?&nbsp; Smaller?&nbsp; &nbsp;How about the white van that&#039;s been circling ever since you made your posts?

				Yeah, I wouldn&#039;t mind talking about how stupid this 50 post count thing is -- a lot of these folks have been SR users for months or years. Whatever the heck floats people&#039;s boats, I guess.

				Another tip for the new folks after I ramble for a moment if I may&nbsp; ;D . I hate the term newbie I&#039;m one as well I guess although I&#039;ve been a member for almost 2 years now. I just haven&#039;t been very vocal in the forums until recently. I was surprised find that I was unable to leave feedback on a particular vendors feedback page regarding a recent transaction so here I am. I think that this is a good time for some of us who are not necessarily &quot;newbies&quot; to share some information and pass on a little advice to the newer people here.<br />Here&#039;s my .02BTC and maybe a little bit more.<br /><br />1)Always do your homework on your vendor. Read the feedback on your vendors page and also read about it here too. Just because you can only post in the newbie section doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t read all of the categories and various topics here. A lot of vendors will have the link posted on their page but if not just search on their name here.<br /><br />2)Personally I would never buy bitcoins from anyone on here. Its very simple to buy your own. There are several ways but I&#039;ll just mention the easiest way by far.<br />First download the bitcoin client which will load a bitcoin wallet onto your computer. http://bitcoin.org/&nbsp; is where you will find this.<br />Then go to bitinstant.com and purchase btc there. Step by step it&#039;s simple. Chose a method of payment. Moneygram is easiest and can be paid at any wal mart among many others. In the instructions you supply your bitcoin address from the wallet now loaded on your computer. They will give you all of the information to fill in on the moneygram slip.&nbsp; First time you launch your bitcoin wallet it will take a while, maybe as much as a few hours to count through the blocks to the current one so be patient when you launch your wallet for the first time.<br />ok I&#039;m done :)<br /><br />Feed ME--------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 16W8ZhwMwLEKL53wHuhVJ31R7BTEZbVe56 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;----------------Feed ME<br /><br />

				Here&#039;s a tip: Don&#039;t finalize early. Spend the time to find vendors that don&#039;t require it, they&#039;re out there and if a product seems to good to be true...it probably is. Always encrypt personal information, if your vendor doesn&#039;t like it then there&#039;s probably someone else selling the same product. Read reviews....they&#039;re there for your safety. If you get scammed out of bitcoins, it&#039;s probably because you&#039;re lazy and impatient.<br /><br />What I&#039;d like to see: More review options. A category for delivery and another for quality.&nbsp; Some cheaper painkillers would be nice too. <br /><br />121HX6y8KUaiDLze4eKH728RcTZBktEr36

				Post anything huh? Here&#039;s some shameless self promotion of my new SR vendor account then! <br /><br />I&#039;m selling tons of brand new chemistry glassware, as well as reagents, and for the college kids, I have test banks (ie. textbook-specific exam answer keys) for sale! Check out my vendor page linked below.<br /><br />PS: I&#039;ve got samples up for newbies, as well as lots of special limited-time opening sales.

				+1 to the &quot;50 posts is BS&quot; idea.&nbsp; Just give my account a &quot;badge&quot; that changes as I earn rep points or whatever like torrent servers do.<br /><br />On the one hand it&#039;s kinda fun to &quot;meet&quot; people and read stuff I wouldn&#039;t normally, since I&#039;m &quot;forced&quot; to post ... but normally I like to keep my mouth shut unless I really feel like I have something to contribute.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t post much. <br /><br />Here&#039;s something to think about: I&#039;m mainly here shopping for prescription meds I take because buying them legally is so goddamn expensive.&nbsp; You gotta call that a total FAIL ... I&#039;m here breaking the law because otherwise I can&#039;t afford to buy the medicine my doctor has prescribed for me (I am without health insurance currently).&nbsp; Go USA.

				It&#039;s going to take forever to hit 50 posts. As soon as BTCs hit my account I will send random amounts to a few people. It&#039;s nothing major, but adds a little extra fun to this chore of chasing 50 posts for all of us.
