				I have used them several times. They are great!<br /><br />The only thing is that a lot of people use them now so they run out of btc quickly. You need to check their web page to see what days they are taking orders for. Yesterday they were sold out for both Wednesday and Thursday so I placed an order for friday.<br /><br />You cannot deposit into an ATM but there is no need to worry about walking into a branch and depositing money into an account... none of your information is required.

				They&#039;re my goto for BTC.&nbsp; Bitcopia is good and Bitinstant is a bit of a pain/have to use a name.&nbsp; Hopefully Bitcopia will be back up shortly.&nbsp;

				Going to a Bank of America is not practical for me, as there are no branches close by. BlueSkyTraders sounds wonderful, but my only option seems to be to send in money, which sketches me out a little.<br /><br />Today I learned of Bitcopia, but unfortunately it seems they are no longer selling bitcoins at all! Their bank account has been shut down or something. They were preferable, but now it seems they are no longer a viable option.<br /><br />How&#039;s Bitinstant? Are there any other good ways to purchase bitcoins anonymously?

				ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />yes, the only downside is having to work with Early Order only. if you do not mind that process you will not be disappointed. <br /><br />like stated they sell out fast, so you won&#039;t be able to use them &quot;on the spot&quot; persay.&nbsp; have put thousands into there boa account and never been asked for id. Ask for a few extra deposit slips so if you don&#039;t mind you can utilize the commercial lane in the drive through.&nbsp; 8)
