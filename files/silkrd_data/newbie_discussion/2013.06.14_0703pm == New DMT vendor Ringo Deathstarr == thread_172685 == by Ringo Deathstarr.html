				Hey,<br />I&#039;m new around these parts, but I&#039;d like to take the time to promote myself as well as my product.&nbsp; My DMT is second to none, and my price can&#039;t be beat.&nbsp; So if DMT is your thing, or if you have been meaning to give it a try, let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;d be more than willing to answer any questions.&nbsp; I will be offering samples to people with strong forum presence.&nbsp; Particularly those from the deemster review thread.&nbsp; So I guess,&nbsp; thanks for checking me out, and I look forward to getting acquainted with a few of you out there.

				Just because I don&#039;t want anything to connect me to any particular package.&nbsp; Trying to stay anonymous.<br /><br />There are various ways,&nbsp; vaporizing it is the best.&nbsp; You can also smoke it sandwiched between some herb.&nbsp; Definitely don&#039;t want to burn it though.

If you&#039;re vaporizing, make sure the flame does not come in contact with the bowl.

				No, most people prefer vaporizing it with a glass vapor genie.&nbsp; Some also use tweak pipes.&nbsp; You could smoke it in a regular pipe, but it would have to be sandwiched between pot.&nbsp; Whatever you do don&#039;t burn it.&nbsp; Burning it destroys the dmt.

				I received my sample yesterday, 100mg right on the money. The stealth was great, my friends thought the package was just junk mail! So it blended in great. They couldn&#039;t understand why I was so excited to be receiving junk mail. Haha. The DMT was a beautiful yellow, with chunks of crystal spread throughout a small amount of fine powder, definitely top quality! It was exactly as Ringo promised it would be. The trip itself left me in wonder and awe. It was an extremely enlightening experience and I will write more about it this evening when my girlfriend and I type up our trip reports. All in all, there&#039;s nothing more I could have asked of Ringo. He was very kind and caring in his communication and was always honest. You can tell that he truly appreciates his customers and wants to help spread this wonderful product around to people who will use it for a higher purpose. He will without a doubt have a returning customer!

				DMT Trip Report<br /><br />Male, 20 years old<br /><br />Dosage: <br />50mg of light, almost neon yellow crystals smoked out of a large bowl sandwiched between two layers of marijuana.<br /><br />Enhancements:<br />1.25g of P.E. Cubensis mushrooms eaten 2.5 hours prior to trip<br /><br />Provider:<br />Ringo Deathstar<br /><br />Preparation: <br />12hr food fast and 3hr water fast<br /><br />25minute barefoot meditation outside at sunset prior to smoking<br /><br />Setting: <br />Dark living room right after sunset, only light source was a tv in the corner of the room that was playing the sound of gentle ocean waves.<br /><br />Experience:<br />I laid back on the couch to begin sparking the bowl we had layered with weed and DMT. I sparked the top layer of bud and pulled the flame away as to not burn the DMT. I slowly inhaled 4 hits, holding each as long as I could and held the last until my head fell back onto the pillow and was propelled into the trip. I was transported to a hallway that had two blue-and-yellow godly faces on either side and a blinding light at the end of the hall. I inherently understood that the end of the hallway is where I wanted to be, I just needed the answer to get there. There seemed to be so much more to it than just walking, I needed guidance. I felt that if I could just make it to the light then all of life&#039;s truths would be revealed to me. The faces on walls began speaking to me, telling me that &quot;The answers you seek are within you. You must simply unlock them through spiritual enlightenment, then you will be ready for the truth.&quot; The light at the end of the hallway slowly started to dim and everything went dark and I began to regain awareness of my worldly body and surroundings. Afterwards, I was stuck in a daze of how paradoxically simple and complex the gods&#039; answer was for 30 minutes or so. <br /><br />Timeline:<br />Onset at T+1 minute and 5 seconds<br />Peak for 5 minutes and 35 seconds<br />Began the descent to baseline after roughly 8 minutes<br />Completely baseline after about 1 hour and 15 minutes
