				Hello All, <br /><br />Its been a couple of months so I figured it was finally time to bite the bullet and register myself here at the forums as well as SR itself. I am very much a rookie in most respects to the dynamics around here, but as a far right libertarian and a, (at least I like to think) reasonably rational human being, I have found the principles that this little haven stands for nothing short of mesmerizing. <br /><br />Like most of my peers, I am your typical 20-something with a mountain of student debt and working a job that is far below my aptitude and education. I just do what I can to make ends meet and try to have as much fun as humanly possible along the way. I would not go so far as to say that I am driven by pure hedonism, but suffice to say that I am a firm believer in the idea that you only live once, and to that end some degree of irresponsible behavior is not grounds to label me a bad person. <br /><br />I look forward to having some interesting discussions with all of you, and I am very glad that fate has somehow brought me to SR. <br /><br />S<br /><br />
