				Well, mission complete.&nbsp; Made my first order with PUREORGANX.&nbsp; The service was the greatest.<br />First order, no F/E required, responded quickly with questions, received in 48 hours.&nbsp; Holy shit.<br />The gear was out of this world great. ;D<br />This vendor was the best, very polite and professional.<br />I would highly recomend PUREORGANX for the gear you need.<br />Thanks again 8)

				Hey Dirk -&nbsp; big fan of your travels with NUMA!&nbsp; Not sure what you purchased from PUREORGANX, But I will say his service and stealth is top notch.&nbsp; &nbsp;His cola and his claim of 97% fishscale is 100% pure unadultered BULLSHIT&quot;.&nbsp; In his defense, maybe he doesn&#039;t do blow, but rather sticks with the MJ &amp; Hash?&nbsp; This only thing his cola did for me was radically raise my heartbeat.&nbsp; The jitteryness was intolerable....as soon as I felt it&nbsp; I immediately started poppin xanax like m&amp;m&#039;s.&nbsp; His answer to this, &quot;I&#039;ve had it tested by my customers and they keep coming back&quot;...obviously, his cola customers have never had Real Blow? I literally flushed 3.25g&#039;s...his answer to this, here&#039;s a $20.00 credit.&nbsp; What a load of crap!&nbsp; Of course, maybe his customers love the thrill of flirting with AFIB?&nbsp; You know, take a ride in an ambulance?&nbsp; Sounds like fun!&nbsp; I really wish for the sake of all enthusiasts of that product that he revise his bogus add....it could really harm someone who is hell bent on chasing the euphoria....

				Have had a few orders with PureOrganx and rate them a 3.9 out of 5.0;&nbsp; product quality changed (it&#039;s just different, not sure if better or worse) and their customer service needs slight improvement.&nbsp; Product looks pretty nice but isn&#039;t 97% pure or uncut as claimed.&nbsp; Burns a little in the nose, makes my palms sweat a bit more than usual, a little racey.&nbsp; Product needs to be chopped and put under a lamp/microwave job to get it dry enough to chop up finely, and it reabsorbs moisture from the air quickly -- somewhat typical stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;It also has a very strong chemical odor.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you wash your own coke to purify it, I&#039;d bet it&#039;s a pretty high % cocaine.
