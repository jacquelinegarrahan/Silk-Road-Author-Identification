				Hey guys,<br />I just purchased nickmode&#039;s coupon pack yesterday and so far I&#039;ve tried two coupons both of which worked. The $10 off hot pockets worked without a hitch, and the computer instantly subtracted $10 off my order when it scanned at Walmart. The $20 off Amazon gift card also worked, but it was sketchier because it scanned twice but nothing showed up, and the cashier (some high school/college girl) thought about getting a manger but decided to just give me the discount manually instead.<br /><br />So I was wondering, if anyone else has bought the pack, what has been your success rate/which ones worked the best? What about gift cards, especially the ones like AMEX/Mastercard GCs or the straight up &quot;FREE&quot; GC coupons? I&#039;m still a bit hesitant to use those, so any advice or comments would be appreciated! <br />Thanks!

				nickmode used a lot of expired coupons.&nbsp; he has a fair amount of valid ones.&nbsp; for the price you get what you pay for<br /><br />the other coupon guy is goldenlotus.&nbsp; his packs are more expansive but they are updated regularly and he has a much larger following than nickmode.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4c52dc5efc<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142981.0<br /><br />I personally have all the Lotus Packs and Have made my money back 100fold, yes I am serious You can see my posts in the forums talking about it.<br />&nbsp;
