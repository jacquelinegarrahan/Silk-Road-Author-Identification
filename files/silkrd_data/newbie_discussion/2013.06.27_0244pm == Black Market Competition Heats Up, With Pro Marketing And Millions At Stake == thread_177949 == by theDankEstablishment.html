				Black Market Competition Heats Up, With Pro Marketing And Millions At Stake - http://pulse.me/s/nr1I7<br />my point of this thread is no matter what company u are working for customer service will make or break the fortune 500. the vendor support on SR is very impatient and insulting.&nbsp; again I am a man of character and convictions. I&#039;m a fuckin straight G. people be acting funny regardless being on forbes ronb report is a common denominator in Haters. I spot them like a big mole.
