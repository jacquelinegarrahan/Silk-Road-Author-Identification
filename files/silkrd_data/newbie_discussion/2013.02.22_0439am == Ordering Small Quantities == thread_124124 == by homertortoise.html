				I&#039;ve been lurking on these boards for a while, but some of the basic questions I have aren&#039;t covered in the FAQs and I wasn&#039;t able to pull up much from the search function. Building up the courage to make my first order...so I figured I&#039;d come on the newbie board to get my postings up to 50+ and gain a bit of credibility before making the plunge. Ease my concerns fellow SRers!!<br /><br />I&#039;m primarily planning to order small quantities of weed (~3.5g) and eventually branch out a bit and give shrooms a try. I likely won&#039;t order very often...mainly due to the fact that I don&#039;t smoke that often, and I&#039;d like to keep as low of a profile as possible. We&#039;re talking maybe once or twice a month.<br /><br />My biggest questions involve shipping and stealth used. I guess I can expect orders for such small amoutns to be delivered in some type of envelope? If so, how do the good vendors keep that method stealthy?<br /><br />Any help is appreciated. Looking forward to interacting more on the boards...and can&#039;t wait to start getting some dank ass shit!

				I know someone who is new as well looking for small quantities here and there of bud and maybe some hash for personal use. But by small I mean &lt;QP . If you&#039;re just looking for 3.5, shit man ask someone in your family before you go through all the work just for that.&nbsp; ::)

				they usually flatten the crap out of the weed and vaccumn seal it so its deadset flat as a tack and it fits in an envelope without raising suspicion.

				Any idea what I can expect in terms of typical packaging for ordering edibles?<br /><br />Would I be incorrect in assuming that ordering small quantities of edibles is toward the bottom of the risk-o-meter?

				&nbsp;;D<br /><br />ordering low quantities for personal use is pretty low risk in and of itself... I get that. - but I&#039;ve noticed most of the vendors for edibles tout their stealthy packaging. Why the need for stealth when shipping hash candy?
