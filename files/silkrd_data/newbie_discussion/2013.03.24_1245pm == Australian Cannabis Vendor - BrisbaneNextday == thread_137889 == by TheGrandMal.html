				There&#039;s a new vendor selling cannabis in Australia called BrisbaneNextDay.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m very hesitant about buying from this vendor for a number of reasons:<br /><br />A week ago he said he &quot;will never ask for FE&quot;, now he&#039;s asking for FE. <br />The image of his product can be found on google (search by image, not text)<br />He is offering &quot;medical AAA+&quot; with no clue what strain it is.<br />He promises &quot;next day delivery&quot; yet he sold out last week(5 days ago) and no one has received the item yet. <br />He&#039;s prices $12 for a gram is very under priced, especially for med grade. <br /><br />Shit, people are selling average hydro for $30(including fees) a gram and he&#039;s got med grade up for 12? His profile used to state that he&#039;s been growing/selling med grade for 10+ years, anyone with that experience would surely know their strains. He&#039;s 5 days late on delivery and going back on his word about FE. Something about the whole thing seems off but I could be wrong and I could be missing out on some great product for a cheap price.<br /><br />Does anyone have any idea about this vendor?

				I was pondering posting about this dude myself...<br /><br />&nbsp;I am torn to know what to think of this &#039;vendor&#039; but some impressions that make me lean towards the &#039;clown&#039; siide of things are;<br /><br />has a &#039;set up a drug cultivation business and get rich quick&#039; type listing.. not verbatem but yeah.. along those line.. Socialengineer anyone?<br /><br />All the bits you mention.. doesn&#039;t seem to as together and on it as they would lead us to believe with the hit and miss start and the rapid changing of terms. I was under the impression that new vendors are not allowed to insist on FE.. need to have some sales under their belt before the SR crew asses them to be ok.... or am I wrong on that?<br /><br />writing style and arrogance level leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. Known guys like this over the years and yeah they have been some of the best suppliers of some outstanding gear... right up until the moment the cops ass rape them and the bragging and &#039;organized convenience&#039; bring them to their knees. They are also, in my experience, the type who can&#039;t handle the bad times as well as they seem to with the good times and so are keen and willing to make deals and sell others out. Just on that.. its the one thing that I wonder about.. when vendors make the big statement &#039;I&#039;m a pro. not in it for anything but to make money so I will be a pro for sure&#039; to me reads like &#039; I&#039;m just a money hunter. Don&#039;t expect loyalty or and protection from me cause you are nothing but a dollar sign and so when the dollar sign disappears the only use left for you with me is to mitigate my punishment by being a final &#039;deal&#039; before I go and lick my wounds&#039;<br /><br />I hope to hell I&#039;m wrong, we need good vendors that are quick and consistent, but there are more than one warning bells on this dude so I will be holding back and fingers crossed when its time to restock my smoke aceman123 will have listings close by for me to grab. That dude, aceman, has been a pleasant and unexpected surprise with all aspects of the multiple deals I&#039;ve grabbed.Only issue is that every time I check these days he seems to have sold the ;latest batch.. lol lucky the last half I got has lasted for as long as it has... for ever btw and still rocking along.<br /><br />Just my 2c

				Looks sketchy as all fuck to me. <br /><br />That &#039;writing style and arrogance&#039; also extends to messages. Also: won&#039;t do PGP or even privnote, so it&#039;s not like he gives too much of a shit about buyers.<br /><br />That all aside: FE for someone with no rep? I don&#039;t think so. <br />I wouldn&#039;t even for established vendors. Why would you bother with this bloke?<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but if that&#039;s the case perhaps he&#039;ll get some custom from me in about six months, when he has a rep, and is using escrow.

				i&#039;d avoid mate, he dropped his prices dramatically from when they initially joined, all fe feedback recks of shill accounts. <br /><br />plus they didnt introduce themselves on the forums or even given out samples not the sign of someone trying to gain peoples trust imo.

				Seller has a listing for 1g and states you do not have to finalise early and does not mention anything about restricting the amount of them you can purchase<br />I placed an order for 10g and received a message saying i had to finalise early as the listing was for 1g only<br />The seller also states that xpress shipping can be tracked so why finalise early, i pointed this fact out to him and also the fact that hes new im not and the order was cancelled.<br />Have never had to finalise early for an AU delivery<br />I normally dont post on forums but dickheads like this should be taken down straight away by SR...They fuck up a good community<br />Buyers Beware

Everything else about the guy is red flag, but it seems like a daft way to scam.<br /><br />That said: there&#039;s no rule that scammers need be bright.<br /><br />Or it&#039;s a super-cunning double bluff. Or triple. Or something. <br /><br />Still, I&#039;ll let other people&#039;s dosh find this out for me.

				Reported for the FE stuff.. that&#039;s not on at all for even an establish Australian vendor yet alone some fly by night looser like this clown.<br /><br />No PGP is not a forgivable sin IMO and this on its own will keep me from ever ordering from them. Proves what I hasd suspected about them and that they not only think they are the shit but have no regard for anyone else and the impact his shit attitude and arrogance could have on their life..<br /><br />The fact the dick is from the single worst state for anything drug related just adds another level of ridiculous to the whole thing... A bong, hell a cone piece, can and has countless times&nbsp; end with a criminal conviction being recorded against an individual. Not common that it on its own will end like that but it has happened more than once that I personally know of.. Get caught with anything that can be put back onto either taking drugs, using drugs or even storing drugs and its a &quot;posses thing used in the commission of a crime&#039; or &#039;posses utensils used for the commission of a crime&#039; charge...<br /><br />so think like you use your phone to ring or txt your dude.. get caught with a g of buds or whatever and as sure as my ass points to the ground you will have the charge added for the phone as a &#039;thing&#039; and when its all done and dusted they destroy your phone.. (oh and the crime being commissioned is.. kid you not, posses dangerous substance... ) so your laptop in 5the case of SR ... <br /><br />I&#039;ve done it but can anyone who has had messages and therefor has some proof click the report vendor on his page please? We need to protect ourselves and the road from these sorts of grandstanding little wankers.. they are dangerous and reflect poorly on the rest of us. beside I think the anonymous nature of SR, if they are even a genuin vendor which is highly dubious, will stroke their ego enough to feel satisfied here.<br /><br />;-P

				I was extremely disappointed at being asked to FE despite a strong purchase history by a buyer who has no history ... And Cancelled<br /><br />After a few PM&#039;s it became obvious that the vendor was not worthy of my trust.<br /><br />I hope that those who have FE&#039;d are not disappointed. I am more than happy to wait until credability is established.<br /><br />DingoAteMyDrugs and Aceman are apparently listing this week ... And both have great product in my size !<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for dry ice another favored vendor ...

				Before he started asking for FE I was convinced it was LE. Something wasn&#039;t right, not knowing you product and getting images off Google. Especially because he wouldn&#039;t be gaining anything selling 1g samples for around $12 with no FE. <br /><br />If he does have legitimate med grade I&#039;m sure everyone will be interested once he sharpens up. <br />I really miss the old product on the road like: Puffin&#039;s Mango and Pineapple, Halfb&#039;s Maui Wowie. Techenergy had some KILLER OG Kush but he&#039;s long gone. <br /><br />Aceman really sets the standard now from what I&#039;m hearing. He&#039;s a top guy, can&#039;t wait to get my hands on some of that Master kush he posted yesterday. <br />

				From what i understand, you need to pay a bond to become a vendor (not sure how much). And once you have 30 sales to the equivalent of $1500 in sales, you are able to get your bond back.<br /><br />Looking at his/her sales, its probably about $1000 in sales now. So if its a scam, its a very difficult way of doing it...<br /><br />Finally, looking at the seller rules:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NOTICE: If you are a new vendor, you may not ask your customers to finalize their orders and release payment to you before you ship, a practice known as &quot;finalizing early&quot;. If you do this, you will lose your selling priviledges.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It seems he/she is not following the rules, and his/her account should be banned.<br /><br />Lets see whats happens over the next few days.

				This brisbanenextday vendor sounds like a 16 yr old making it up as he goes.<br /><br />States that you must FE and you will wear the cost if it doesnt show.<br /><br />Yet with his franchise listing he suddenly has confidence in the system because he will be supplying you presumably in the same delivery method.<br /><br />And there were lots of people that were FE in his feedback.<br /><br />No doubt his messages to angry customers will be &#039;its the easter break&#039;&nbsp; things are slow type excuse. Thats if he even bothers to keep this charade going.<br /><br />Good luck i think you will need it.

				It costs $500 to become a vendor and you can apply to get it back. I only just found out a few days ago that you can get the $500 back, or at least part of it.<br /><br />Also, my listings will be up very soon. But will be sent out on Easter Monday.

				Pretty unfortunate that people are taking advantage of the Aus cannabis market. <br /><br />Now there&#039;s a new seller called TakeAction, with a lot of speculation that it&#039;s the same person as BrisbaneNextDay. <br />Once again, I&#039;d stay right away from this vendor, 43% THC? I don&#039;t think so, some of the highest that can consistently be produced is in the high 20&#039;s.<br />Seed banks always display the &#039;record&#039; yield and potency and he&#039;s obviously gone from that.

I&#039;ve ordered 3.5g before and was very happy with the product (albiet a bit squished due to vac seal but nothing too bad)<br />But what&#039;s the justification for such a high price? it&#039;s literally DOUBLE? Guess I&#039;ll just have to wait for Halfbaked to get more stock, never had a problem with him/her and the weed is very nice.

				Unsure after the road going for a few years now there is literally not a single weed dealer on there from Aus who is value?<br />I am sure the product is fine in many cases but seems weed, coke, mdma, lsd etc are all more expensive on the road then on the streeet with the benefit being feedback and a better idea of quality. Looking forward to sussing out the best vendors!!

It&#039;s fairly easy if you know how to do it well ;)<br />But the prices are higher on Silk Road because we have to pay: Silk Road fees, bitcoin exchange fees and withdrawal fees. Also it takes time to package every order.<br />Selling on the street takes very little time and doesn&#039;t have fees and costs.
