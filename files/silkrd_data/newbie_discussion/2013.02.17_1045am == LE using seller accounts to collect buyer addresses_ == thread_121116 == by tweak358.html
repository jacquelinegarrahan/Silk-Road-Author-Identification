If the title says: &quot;ATM Hack&quot; then they could argue that by buying the book, it was your intention to carry out illegal activities. Even if the ebook contains public domain info. (which most ebooks on here do, incidentally). <br /><br />If a be vendor is selling *only* ebooks, be wary. <br /><br />One thing I DO know, is that new buyers often buy a few cheap e-books to get their buying stats up, in order to avoid the whole unofficial FE for new customers, rule. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I think about it anyway. <br /><br /><br />

				I would like to note that vendors selling digital goods are unable to see your home address unless you are foolish enough to enter it in the order form. The ATM hack for one, is delivered via a SR private message.

				A certain amount of being cautious I think is warranted and will do you good when conducting transactions on the old road.&nbsp; By being more cautious you are less likely to be a dumb ass motherfucker and do something stupid.&nbsp; Would LE do something like that?&nbsp; Well most LE have way bigger fish to fry then somehow blacklisting you from receiving something.&nbsp; Plus logistically how would they do that?&nbsp; How would you get any mail then?&nbsp; Seems way to old school for LE.

				Say I know I&#039;m still offically a newbie and all , or who knows maybe not =p, but first off don&#039;t vendors have to purchase seller accounts though auction? Well I guess that wouldn&#039;t be that hard to do seeing LE usually has funds set aside for operations. I guess newbies are most vulnerable here. I&#039;ve only been around 9 months, 2-3 actively and even I scrolled through every single cannabis page before I even chose a vendor, if your not doing the same you might as well be block coppn, cuz thats the risk your takin.

				If some LE agency went to the trouble (waste of time imo) of setting up an account the only problem is the demand can never be stopped,it is like the octopus tentacle that gets cut off only to replace itself. I think they are more focused on shutting down the whole SR.
