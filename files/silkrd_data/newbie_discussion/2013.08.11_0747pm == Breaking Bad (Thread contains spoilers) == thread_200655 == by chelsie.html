				Oh Hell Yeah! Thank you for reminding me that new episodes of Breaking Bad start tonight! I will surely be watching it. I probably wont do the marathon. I think will just watch the last 4 episodes. <br /><br />This show has gone through a lot of changes. What do you guys think? Will this last season be any good?

				Watched them all again. Noticed the moment Walt saw the Lily of the Valley for the first time and decided to poison the child. The scene was meaningless without the context of the later episodes.<br /><br />There are parts of the series that you cannot appreciate unless you have seen future episodes.

				No way, that scene when he was sitting there outside by the pool and he was thinking and he looked at the flower I just knew. Ok think about remeber earlier how Walt talked to Mike to get Jesse out of the picture and Mike basically told him to go fuck himself? It was all part of the plan to get Jesse out of the picture while he set his plan in motion. I&#039;ve watched all the episodes countless times and anaylzed it to death. There&#039;s quite a serious plot in Breaking Bad with deep characters with conflicting motives each other and often with themselves.<br /><br />I predict that Walt gets saved by Jesse in the end. They have a bond that can&#039;t be broken now. Walt is like a poisonous father to Jesse but he turned Jesse from Captain Cook to someone on the same level as him and he&#039;s prolly the only one in Jesse life that believed in him and supported him. However if the truth comes out that Walt killed Mike all bets are off!<br /><br />Did I answer your question if I&#039;m excited? lol

				Ya no lol that&#039;s not happening I don&#039;t think. I was watching an interview and all the actors/actresses where saying that they couldn&#039;t believe what their characters were doing and how low Walt could go. Apparently he hasn&#039;t reached his lowest yet... there&#039;s going to be so much going on each episode.... 4 more hrs!

				ya Skylar is a major bitch lol.. but the trend with AMC shows women is that they have a very strong personality and tend to wear the pants in the family. You know if everyone didn&#039;t try to control Walt when he learnt he had the cancer and viewed him with pity or try to give him handouts I don&#039;t think he would of resorted to cooking meth. His ego was so hurt and why wouldn&#039;t it be? Being that smart and being nowhere in life. It makes us the ultimate question. Everyone of us has a thing we can do that we can be the best at but what if they thing you are best at is cooking meth? Hmmmmmm?<br /><br />

				Yeah I agree but I still like her character. When I first watched Breaking Bad I hated Hank but the more times I&#039;ve watched it I really like his character know. At first glance he seems like your typical gun ho DEA agent but he&#039;s complex. I can see him catching Walt and letting him go. If it wasn&#039;t for Walts drug money to pay for his rehab he may not even be walking but Hank doesn&#039;t know that, lol. Too many angles..

				Well it started off slow I thought but damn that ending was tense! Walt just fucking straight up told Hank don&#039;t fuck with me, lol... but Hank has got a hell of a crazy look in his eye. I think that Ricin Walt came back for is going to be for Jesse. Hank would be too obvious, mark my words!

				ya that&#039;s how I felt for the first 40mins but come on..the ending? Seriously you didn&#039;t like that... that encounter has been building up for like 5 seasons. Remember when they had the party for Walt at his house after his cancer went into remission and Walt being the ass he is had a stand off with Hank? That encounter was like a prelude to this one. Idk man I&#039;ve always been on Walts side but I&#039;m kinda shifting now. He&#039;s way worse than Gus ever was. At least with Gus he was a rational business man. The only mistake he made was his utter hatred for that old dude which got him killed.

				the last part of the show was definitely entertaining, no doubt. just the whole first 40 min was kinda boring.<br /><br />also, i dont think walt is much worse than gus. im still rooting (sp?) for walt lmao, just because i hate cops, and have always loved the bad guy. <br /><br />The thing i really didnt like tho, was how the inmates that todds uncle hired burned the one guy to death. thats inhuman to me.

				Yes! I totally didn&#039;t expect that... I thought they were just going to hug or something but he&#039;s like ya bitch it&#039;s on!<br /><br />BTW I was wondering where the fuck is Todd anyways? He just kinda dropped off?<br /><br />&nbsp;Ok prediction time..here&#039;s what happens Hank figures to leave Walt to his fate cause if he exposes him then everyone in the DEA will think he&#039;s a total tool plus Walts cancer is back anyways however Jesse has a serious vendetta againest Walt. Convinced that he killed Mike, Jesse stalks him and has nothing to lose. <br /><br />This is evident as you see him throwing away fat stacks out the car window. All Walt cared about is the money and being the &#039;guy&#039; but Jesse just wants to be a good person. Mike was actually a good father figure for Jesse and Walt took that away. The trend I&#039;m seeing is that no one is believing Walts lies anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;Oh NVM Lydia that big fucking sketchbag, lol... I think with Walt not cooking some people overseas are going to be pissed that they are no longer getting fat stacks and send people to deal with Walt or Lydia.

				I think that Walt can extort Hank into submission because Walt paid for his PT. Walt could make a case that Hank was a conspiritor, use this to threaten Hank&#039;s family, keep him on a leash.<br /><br />I think that Hank will start accepting money and become a true conspirator.

				Just sayin, I think Walts gunna end up putting the rice shit in his chemo thing after his family leaves him because Hanks gunna end up ratting him out. Linda&#039;s clients are gunna be pissed and try to get to Walts family, that&#039;s what that big gun in his trunk in the beginning of the episode was for. <br /><br />Remember, Walt said that his empire was all he had left, also his family, and if they both leave he&#039;s gunna end up killing himself

				Keep it coming, good theory crafting!<br /><br />In regards to Hank taking money I don&#039;t think Hank would ever do that. He&#039;s too much of an honest guy and has strong ethics and values. Remember the scene in the garage where Walt confronted him? He was so disgusted with him, like utterly. I think Hank, his wife, Skylar and the kids all move far away from there. So that just leaves Jesse and Lydia.<br /><br />I also think Walt has way too much pride and ego to ever kill himself. If he&#039;s going to die he&#039;s going to take out as much of his enemies as possible AKA Scarface, lol. I&#039;m convinced it&#039;s going to be a showdown between Walt and Jesse and maybe some of Lydias connections overseas. <br /><br />Think about how many arguments Jesse and Walt have had and never mind the actual physcall fights which I think are 3 in total. The other reason I think Hank is going to be a non factor is that Hank knows everything now. Whats he going to do bust Walt and in the process shame himself? I don&#039;t see that happening. Walt flat out told him it&#039;s me bitch what you going do? Where with Jesse it&#039;s just lie after lie. Remember when Jesse thought Walt poisoned the kid? He was ready to off him then and there but he didn&#039;t because he believed Walts lies. Now fast forward and if Jesse truly believes 100% that Walt killed Mike which by judging from the last episode he does then that must mean that he would believe he was lying about poisoning the kid Brock and furthermore that he helped Walt kill Gus(a person who believed in him) which ultimately lead to Mikes death and Jesse basically at the same place we found him at the beginning of the show with the exception of 5 million dollars :)
