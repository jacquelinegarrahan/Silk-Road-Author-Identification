				Alright.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a serious question. I haven&#039;t tripped in 20+ years. On acid anyways. I used to eat it every two or three weeks for years.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about giving it another go .&nbsp; I could use some insight into any pitfalls or drawbacks to tripping again. I had not had shrooms for 10 years and thx to SR I&nbsp; &nbsp;was able to revisit that and had a blast(from the past). I&#039;m middle class, semi clean cut and nobody in my world even knows I still smoke let alone trip, so I would be going it alone. <br /><br />Any input would be appreciated.

				My only advice would be to go for it and enjoy the ride :) I&#039;d say it will completely blow your mind if you haven&#039;t had it in so long! I&#039;d highly recommend the Dalai Lama tabs if you are in a position to get your hands on them ;)

				Definitely go for it mate :) it will bring back some great memories and experiences. I was the same, hadn&#039;t tripped for about 15 years until I found this place. Now I have a nice stock of tabs he he.<br />I trip alone and love every minute of it 8)<br />Check out the avengers review thread on LSD http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0 <br /><br />Good luck and enjoy :D

				I wish more people could activate their third eye instead of lookin for stuff to make it happen without opening the third eye fully.<br /><br />I can leave my fysical body and fly anywhere and remote view anything anywhere.. <br /><br />You could never do that thru drugs you can only do hat by activating your third eye thru meditating and stop the poisoning of your own body by eating right and clean foods.<br /><br />We are just searchin for whats inside of our third eye since there is some real powers in it and humans are sungods and we can fly and stuff since we have a bunch of different energybodies on top of our fysical body and I doubt you can use any of them energybodies thru using drugs, meditating makes your pineal gland produce DMT on demand, myself I think the drugs forces the pineal to create DMT constantly until the high wears off..<br /><br />think about it.<br /><br />Take care man and good luck

				Yeah Roger I think I&#039;ll just do the drugs. I&#039;m using my mind for stupid shit right now, like making money and running my household. <br /><br />Anyways...how about a dosage recommendation. When I used to trip in the mid 80&#039;s , we&#039;d eat show acid that was very clean and fairly strong. I don&#039;t want to come up short. Of course I have no idea what the ug was on that stuff.(blue globe anybody?).<br /><br />My recent shroom experience was a little weak. And I ended up eating 7gs, but I think I waited too long eating the last few grams.

				I was going to open my third eye using mushrooms and it failed totaly and the high was no good but i did not meditate while tripping either and you probably should so you can see what the third eye powers can do, its just a small taste tho and if you activate it fully then you be able to astral travel, create your own dreams, talk to aliens and relatives and guides in the spiritual world..<br /><br />I ate 5 grams just because that was what Bill Hicks used and when he told the audience they sounded like that alot to eat so I thought it was, but it was not it was damn weak, I tried it twice to with 5 grams each time and nothing happaned basicly and I wish I did not.<br /><br />I should had meditated from the beginning and manifested it thru writing it down what I want to do with the third eye.<br /><br />When i did write it down that i want to astraltravel and remote view and stuff, then it took 2 days and I was remote viewing.<br /><br />Its all about your higher self and when you write stuff down youe manifesting it, thats why the schoolsystems get you to write down what slaveposition you want to have when you grow up since then youre manifesting it and willing it into existance.<br /><br />They know shit we did not know because of them basicly.<br /><br />And I just had a guy writing to me telling me about that he wrote down what he wanted to do , astraltravel and stuff, and the same night he was on some beautiful planet in the astraldimension, 4th dimension.<br /><br />Good luck man but I suggest you manifest stuff before you take the acid, write shit down that you want to do while tripping like talkin to your higher self or visiting the astraldimension.<br /><br />Peace!

				Go for it.<br />You&#039;ll have forgotten how fucking great acid is, and it&#039;ll be like the first day of your life all over again.<br />There&#039;s a hell of a lot more music to discover over the last two decades, so I doubt you&#039;ll get bored ;)<br /><br />Have an awesome trip

Kittenhuffer sells nice acid to at lower ug 110 I think. You can always start with one and double up after an hour or so if it hasn&#039;t kicked in.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried tesselated&#039;s acid (about 200ug), but its supposed to be really good from his reviews. A 10 strip minimum though.

				The thing is that we are all searchin for something, and it is probably our higher self inside our third eyes that we are lookin for since we are only using like 5% of our DNA now and a part of us is in the higher realms since we are multidimensional godly types of beings and we are the rarest beings in this 3D universe..<br /><br />The only ones who does not know how special humans are, is humanity themselves.<br /><br />The aliens from all over the universe are flying around here checkin us out since they want to know how its going for the special ones when they dont even know they are special multidimensional ones.<br /><br />them aliens can only go into the 4th dimension but human can go much higher.<br /><br />Just look up buddahboy on youtube, he sat under a massive tree meditating for 10 months without water and food because big trees are like portals to higher planes, and he probably had a great time compared to mushroom trips and crazyness like that.<br /><br />i think you ges into the 4th dimension if you lucka when using drugs but you still will not have much&nbsp; controll over it like you do when meditating with the intent to go inside to travel outside but its really inside since you got a universe inside you.

They will blow you away. The quality of the acid on those tabs is very high. The visuals I had from my first one of them were beautiful. I actually meditated for about 3 hours on one of them and my mind was brought to places that I never even knew existed. It was incredible :)<br /><br />Whatever you go with, I wish you well on the trip :)
