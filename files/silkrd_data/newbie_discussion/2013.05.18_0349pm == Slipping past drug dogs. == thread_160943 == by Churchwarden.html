				Hello fellow travellers of the Silk Road,<br /><br />My question to you is what&#039;s the best way to slip past drug dogs/can it even be attempted with any real certainty? I&#039;m going to a festival soon and I want to bring in a gram or two of top grade mandy rather than buy whatever dirt is floating around inside.<br /><br />My plan is as follows:<br /><br />I&#039;m ordering MDMA off a vendor well known for their stealth, so depending on the size of the bag the actual MD is in I&#039;m going to stash it inside a zippo that I have fiddled with so that when you pull out the inner silver cartridge the inside of it has some of the cotton the petrol goes on at the top so the lighter still works. Under that I will stash my goods, followed by another layer of cotton, then the tamper that keeps all the cotton in in the first place. (I don&#039;t know how familiar everyone is with zippos but they&#039;re essentially filled with cotton to draw the petrol through so I&#039;ve made a small hollow in the middle where I will stash the MD so that the lighter is still functional, and unless you literally took the inner portion out of the shell, pulled back the tamper, and started ripping cotton out you would never know it&#039;s there.) So I&#039;m gonna keep it in there, keep my zippo in a pack of smokes and strut up in there like IDGAF.<br /><br />will the petrol in the zippo help mask the potential odor from the mandy, if any can even slip out of all those layers of high grade, expertly thought out stash tactics?<br /><br />any advice is appreciated, I know if worse comes to worse I can just drop before but I don&#039;t want to be skitzing out, having a rad time at like 1pm and then just come down.

				I always take weed abroad. I have trundled past the dogs many times with a bundle of stinky weed in my bag. Last time I went abroad I took&nbsp; C, H and weed. I sealed it all in cling film using hot scissors to produce an airtight closure and packed it in my socks.<br /><br />If you are very paranoid, make the mandy into a clingfilm ball, put it in a condom, tie off, and insert into your anus. Use the remaining length of the condom as a &#039;string&#039; to retrieve the drug. You&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />

				Yeah it&#039;s a drum and bass, dubstep, EDM festival so I expect there will be insane amounts of mandy moving through the gates to be fair. <br /><br />Are the dogs only trained to smell one kind of drug at a time? I had heard that dogs will be trained for coke, or weed or explosives or whatever specially.

				I&#039;ve done a fair bit of research into sniffer dogs in recent years. Whilst I won&#039;t deny they have a far superior sense of smell to humans I&#039;m also of the belief that a significant number of stops they make are on instruction of their handler rather than out of their own instincts.<br /><br />Basically their hander spots someone he doesn&#039;t like the look of and pulls on the lead, or whatever the signal is, to make the dog sit down / jump up which constitutes the indication that someone is carrying.<br /><br />The dogs are mainly there to help the police fabricate their &quot;suspicions.&quot; Once they&#039;ve got it to sit down next to you they have their perfect legal excuse to make a search. Without the dog they need other forms of evidence against you to warrant a search which can be more difficult to come by. Having the dogs there makes their job so much easier. Regardless of whether the dog has given a legitimate indication or not.<br /><br />Another trick they like to use is pulling people who attempt to avoid the dogs. This also constitutes suspicion for search. Let&#039;s say you enter the festival and inside there&#039;s three separate paths to choose. The first path has a cop with a dog stood on it whilst the other two don&#039;t. The naive man, feeling scared, would understandably take the seemingly easier option of the latter two paths but unbeknownst to him would be running the risk of being stopped and searched for avoiding the dog. The police see avoidance as a sign of guilt. My advice to anyone in this situation is to be brave. Grit their teeth and chose the path that walks past the dog. Play the police at mind games. From their point of view why would anyone with drugs on them choose to walk past the dog when there&#039;s safer looking routes with no dogs available? If you win the mind games the cop&#039;s not going to pull on the lead either.<br /><br />Dogs also pick up on fear. They can literally smell it and pet dogs have often gone for people who they can sense fear emanating from. Out of all the people walking past the sniffer dogs you&#039;d imagine those carrying drugs would most likely wreek of fear which could also set them off. My advice would be to think positive and aggressive thoughts. Instead of worrying about what you might have concealed in your pocket, and giving off bad vibes, try thinking of how strong you are and how you&#039;d easily waste the dog in a fight after a few boots to it&#039;s head etc. Don&#039;t get me wrong I don&#039;t advocate any kind of violence towards people or animals but if thinking those kind of thoughts prevents you from smelling of fear and getting nicked then it&#039;s surely something worth considering.<br /><br />Finally sniffer dogs are only capable of working for something like two hours at a time. After this their &#039;freshness&#039; goes and they begin to become restless and&nbsp;more prone to mistakes. If they&#039;re still getting worked after this time that&#039;s when the cop pulling on the lead comes into his own! ;-)

				No problem mate. Always happy to help a fellow raver. Check out this extract from an article about Devon and Cornwall&#039;s operation at Newquay station a couple of years ago. Proves the importance about never turning away from the dogs.<br /><br />&quot;Twelve police officers in stab-proof vests and a sniffer dog are here to meet the train from Paddington. &#039;What we’re looking for is people turning away from the drugs’ dog,’ explains Sgt Ian Drummond-Smith, who spearheaded Operation Brunel to confiscate alcohol and drugs from teenagers arriving by train (Operation Touchdown is the equivalent at Newquay Airport). &#039;We always get results from people turning away from dogs.’<br /><br />It goes on to mention that undercover police were riding the trains from London into Cornwall attempting to spot potential suspects before they got there and presumably radioing ahead to the men on the ground. Which begs the question; if the dog&#039;s sense of smell is as accurate as we&#039;re lead to believe then why the need to splash the cash on these extra resources? The answer of course being that the officers usually pick their suspects before the dog does!<br /><br />Therefore bear in mind there could be undercover cops in the queue weighing you up before you even get to the dogs so no loose talk.

				Yeah, good call. Just have to power through. Honestly if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m not even worried because the crowd is going to be flooding through and I&#039;m not really the nervous type. I was just worried about how tightly you need to wrap shit up to avoid the &#039;Canine super sense of smell&#039; but if it&#039;s just a mind fuck then whatever. I&#039;ve gone through before to another festival where I live a few times with MD in front of a dog but the dog is this little retarded looking thing that always has its tongue lolling out it&#039;s mouth so you see it and are kind of like, &quot;Haha nice try.&quot;

				Is this show in the usa? I&#039;ve never seen drug dogs at any American concert, and regularly walk in with weed in my pack of smokes and a pipe by my balls. Unless your worried about sneaking something through an airport i wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				As-long as you don&#039;t walk right next to the dog, you&#039;ll be fine. <br />Presumably you won&#039;t all be directed past a dog in single file?&nbsp; <br /><br />Dog handlers lead the dogs to people to sniff. Keep away from the handlers, and you&#039;ll be ok.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m a first timer to this festival but I&#039;m sure it will go down in that fashion. Usually they just hang out by the people handling the tickets so they force everyone to move by them.

				Awesome thread- these are things I&#039;ve always been curious about. There have been a NUMBER of times when I&#039;ve been driving around (usually smoking ganja) and I&#039;ll get one of those cop cars with the &#039;K-9&#039; tag parked next to me in traffic. It always wigs me out a little bit, but nothing has ever come of it. I agree with the person above, though... I&#039;ve never seen them at a concert/festie (in the USA). This thread definitely has some great advise in terms of tricking the handlers, though. If I ever happen upon a situation like the one described at least I&#039;ll know how to handle it now!&nbsp; :D

				long story short, leaving out personal details of course but a police officer with a drug dog in the back of the car offered me a ride after i flagged him down and asked him for some help. when i had a small amount of weed on me that i had forgotten about. I hopped right in the passenger seat, the cop gave me a ride, was really nice/friendly and even let me pet his dog, he sniffed me and seemed excited but i was never busted. as i got into my car i reached into my pocket for a pack of smokes and felt the weed. :)

				Interesting stuff, also with drug dogs, they are easy to trick too, if you toss a tiny bit of cocaine their way, they will alert at it and as soon as the drug gets in their nose it fucks their smell sensors up and they cannot smell ANYTHING for like 2 hours or so =p haha and they never mix drug sniffing dogs with explosives sniffing dogs because they cant learn those two as efficiently, I think some smells cross between the two in a way that fucks em up. But both drug dogs and explosives can track people scents, as the scent of a human being will not confuse them from drugs or explosive traces.

				I know plenty of people who&#039;ve been sniffed by sniffer dogs in queues for parties with drugs in their hands and the dog was none the wiser.<br /><br />I&#039;ve walked through a wall of 3 police officers each with a drug dog with 15g of mdma on me (worst decision of my life), but I smiled at the officers and the dogs and walked on through. I was terrified but pretended otherwise. Whilst nothing happened, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this as it&#039;s your own life and freedom that you are risking. I didn&#039;t realise there would be this level of security coming into the festival.<br /><br />Whilst this is based upon anecdotal evidence, I think drug dogs are more of a deterrent than they are an actual detection method. Whilst their smell is far superior, in an environment such as a festival there are so many smells going round the dog must be having a field day.<br /><br />Whatever you do, conceal well so even if you are searched they won&#039;t find anything. You could but it inside the seams of your sleeping bag and then sew up whatever hole you made. There are many options.<br /><br />Be cautious<br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t really matter either way. The way I am going to hide it even if they pick up on me I think it&#039;ll be hard enough to find that I can play off that I&#039;ve been in contact with it recently and that&#039;s it. If they press it further and find it, I&#039;m only bringing enough to dose me for a day, we&#039;re talking like &gt;300mg, they&#039;ll take it off me, at worst bar my entry.

				Try using a steel water bottle. The kind that has the twist-on top with a gasket. I put all kinds of things in theese wrapped in a plastic grocery bag for padding. Opaque, air-tight, nondescript, and no movement when shaken. Also, like $4 at a dollar store.<br /><br />Just make sure you don&#039;t get any residues on the outside of the bottle.<br /><br />Karma me up please, if you guys like this idea.

				Just wanted to update on this one,<br /><br />I snuck MD in both days using the method in my first post, inside a lighter, double dimebagged. Went past no less than 10 dogs heading in, same on the way out. Also got taken back to a search area and someone searched all my possessions for contraband and still made it through. Never going to worry about this kind of thing again, really think the dogs are mostly for show unless they get right in your shit and you are carrying a sufficient amount of whatever it is they&#039;re trained to smell. Even that is only speculation cause I passed within a foot of several dogs with more than a gram of MD and there were no worries.

				I once disembarked from a small plane in what looked like a field. It was a tiny Irish airport. I was off there for a music festival with Mrs. Lee. Now I love dogs and all - I have one - but the sight of this one was not welcome.<br /><br />There was a small room, glass windows affording a view from the runway. There were at least a dozen police flanking this room, and a black labrador. Back in the day I grew, I had about half an ounce of absolutely killer C99 in my little rolly bag. I trundled up, knelt to the dog and gave him a love. So did Mrs. Lee. We strolled on through without a problem, despite the fact that when I knelt beside the bag I could smell it myself.<br /><br />I felt like complaining to someone, actually. Either that was a bomb dog or it is a fucking hopeless detective - perhaps the Clouseau of labradors. <br /><br />On another note, some fifteen or so years ago I went to Holland and bought a kilo of hash, which I cling filmed and stuck in my briefcase, which was all I was carrying. I had had a haircut and was wearing a three piece suit. We were all stopped at Belgian customs and practically everyone was taken apart - cases out, belongings strewn on the desk - it was not looking good. The kilo was just thudding around in my stiff leather briefcase, which contained nothing else but a pen and a pair of underpants. I was going to need the underpants it seemed.<br /><br />I watch the guy in front of me as his luggage is tossed, and calmly greet the policeman on the desk as the man before me picked up his socks to match them and pack them. Miraculously the cop waved me on. <br /><br />I managed not to sweat, panic, scan the room or give him the telltale &#039;smile&#039; - which looks like the grimace of a man trying to pass a turd the size of, well, a kilo of Afghan hash? I made my way back to Blighty and sold the lot to a bunch of Rastas in Brighton. Job done!<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had any problems with dogs or customs, but that one time there was the closest I came. In less careful days I had come home from Holland once with about two kilos of top leaf just bundled in a headscarf and tied to the top of my rucksack. Mind you, no suit that time. I probably looked so damned obvious they decided not to stop me. I didn&#039;t even remember the weed until I was home for a week and someone asked me about it.<br /><br />

				Dogs only detect whatever it is they are trained for and only when they are instructed to. If the dog did whatever it wanted the handler would never have control. Their lives are based on a work/reward process. They are excellent at smelling and finding what they are looking for. They don&#039;t get up in the morning and think they are going to save the world, they only want to make their master happy.

				I got stopped during my arrival in NZ for a beagle-sniff. The dog stopped at almost every bag. The women all had fruit-flavored lip balm, were very casual about it. I had a joint in a writing pen, and just mentioned I had an orange with my meal on the flight over (which was true).<br /><br />Social engineering...

				Not sure about the mail but I know a trick for airports and lines is to have a buddy who has no drugs but stinks of it walk past the dog ahead of you to distract it. While the dog is stopping your friend just walk by.

				I got caught by a dog in Calais Hover Port along time ago.&nbsp; The hovercraft is like a plane to board and you stand in line.&nbsp; I was young (17/18) and with my girlfriend and her unsuspecting Mum.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I had about 1/8 of hash in my jeans pocket.&nbsp; They had a dog, a spaniel I believe,&nbsp; kind of hidden at the front of the line and when I got there it instantly started wagging its tail and jamming its nose into my leg,&nbsp; I was promptly picked up by the Police and walked away in humiliation infront of 100+ people including my gf and her mum.<br /><br />Luckily at the time it was the equivalent of a £20 fine for possession under 5 grams.&nbsp; They were there on a tip off and I just got caught in the crossfire for being careless.&nbsp; They even held the boat up for me for 5 mins past the departure time. <br /><br />Needless to say the prospective mother in law took it very badly and was a pretty awkward 2hour drive home the other side.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />But that sniffer dog certainly did his job efficiently. These days when I go on hols I use smell proof sealed packs, no sharp edges and in your sock.&nbsp; Cant see how that can fail for small personal amounts.

				Only a human would teach a dog to be a snitch.<br /><br />I bet the dog thinks it is a game and does realize he is fucking over the people he discovers drugs on.

				To be honest when it comes to anything cannabis related I am not surprised people have been caught by dogs trained to smell it. Most of the time even if you got some guy to sniff around he&#039;d be able to pick up the smell, even a dime bag full of smelly weed in my pocket I can sometimes pick up whiffs when I&#039;m out and about. Nowadays though, depending on where you live and if you&#039;re just carrying personal stash, it really isn&#039;t even a major concern to get caught with weed.

				There&#039;s a good thread in one of the main forums, packaging I think. Some guys got hold of a retired sniffer dog and tested it out with various drugs and packaging types.<br />I went to a fesvital recently, with clean clothes. Wasn&#039;t carrying anything, dog sniffed something in my wallet, got searched but luckily I&#039;d just pushed all the goodies through the fence next to the camp site&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Wear clean clothes! Don&#039;t smoke a joint and then walk through the gates!
