				I am a new seller on SR, and after about 10 days of straight research on this site, I am pretty much ready to start responsibly selling. Only question I can&#039;t find an answer for is... what is the best way to print a label and/or to purchase postage?!? I can&#039;t seem to find the correct thread for this topic. Any help is appreciated, and if you help me get it going, I will gladly kick you some bitcoin down the road after some sales. I will be a trusted SR seller for life and any help I can get now will be rewarded once the BTC starts flying in. Thank you so much ahead of time for any and all help!

				Hi, I&#039;m not an expert and not a seller, but some things I&#039;ve seen in the forums say right to always use a printed/typed address label (not handwritten) and to make sure it is neatly and squarely applied to the box (not crooked). There was a thread that said to be careful what printer you use, since some (mainly color) printers spit out an identifiable code in light yellow. So the printer should have been purchased anonymously not near where you actually are.<br /><br />For postage, I&#039;ve heard of people using stamps for packages light enough to drop in a blue box. Someone mentioned buying prepaid priority mail envelopes and boxes, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;ve ever seen those. The 400 label seems to be a popular tracking choice.<br /><br />Someone mentioned using open wifi hotspots to do the priority mail shipping right from usps dot com using prepaid visa cards I think they said. Of course whatever method is used it must be top notch stealth.
