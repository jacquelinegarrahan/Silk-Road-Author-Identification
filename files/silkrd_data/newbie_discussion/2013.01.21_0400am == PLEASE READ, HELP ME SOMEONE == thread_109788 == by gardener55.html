				Hi, if any of you has had this experience please share, or if you just have an opinion please share, all is appreciated. When I was looking for bitcoin dealers I used the recommended list under buyers guide. I went to Mt.Gox using the link listed and opened an account using my bank information. I did all this on the Tor browser. A few days passed and I had decided I didn&#039;t want to use Gox after reading that they track all customers who use Tor to access. It was a red flag to me. I tried to access my account the same way, to remove the info and close my account and when I tried to log on it said to this effect,&quot;too many attempts to log on, try again in 24 hours&quot; now I am a little freaked because I hadn&#039;t attempted to log on in days. So then I went and used my regular browser, putting in mtgox.com, tried to log in and it said my password wasn&#039;t right. So I clicked &quot;get password&quot;, they sent the code to my&nbsp; email, I triple checked it when I put it in and it still won&#039;t work...idk at this point what is going on. I learned after the fact from another member that if you access mt gox via Tor they can freeze your account. Is that what has happened? and why? I have never purchased yet. I don&#039;t like my bank info floating around at mt gox, and is it secure? Who could get access to it? I hope to get lots of response to this, and THANK-YOU so much to those who respond.

				not to sure about what to do to reslove your delima but when ya get it straightened out use this : ****CLEARNET WARNING****&nbsp; https://www.bitinstant.com/&nbsp; ****CLEARNET WARNING****&nbsp; <br />there you can just go to CVS or wal-mart and or other places to do the btc transfers anonymously.<br /><br />maybe go to mtgox and contact them through the contact info on their website and delete your account ... not too sure though.<br /><br /><br />and when ya get it straightened out Always...ALWAYS..use PGP to encrypt your address.<br /><br /><br />Good Luck &amp; Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat

It&#039;s too obvious as it becomes un-anonymous after you enter in info that ties you to it...<br /><br />2nd, get a hold of someone over at mtgox and get your info off of their site...<br /><br />It sounds as if someone has access to your account to be honest. I don&#039;t know a lot about mtgox and tor flagging but if your account was frozen or banned you would know.<br /><br />Change your shit immediately.
