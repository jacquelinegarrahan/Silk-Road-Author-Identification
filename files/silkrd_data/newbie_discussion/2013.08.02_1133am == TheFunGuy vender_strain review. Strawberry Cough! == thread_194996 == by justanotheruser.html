				I might be a newbie on this forum, but I know good weed and good people when I see them.<br />I suffer from anxiety and have been on a journey to find the right kind of weed for me. Some weed can trigger anxiety attacks for me :/<br />I&#039;m sure all you anxiety sufferers have found the same info on some popular strains for relief. Jack Herer, NL#5, Trainwreck, C99.... Strawberry Cough<br />I&#039;ve navigated the SR for the last 2 months trying to find that gold. I&#039;ve gone through Purple Trainwreck, Blue Berry Trainwreck, Blue Dream, GSC.<br />Every other purchase was TheFunGuy&#039;s strawberry cough. Now his SC will be the only buds I purchase <br />TFG messages me the day he sends the order out, I get it in 2 days ( probably on the same coast ) Stealth is A+ <br />If you have any questions, TFG responds before you can even finish sending a message...<br />TFG&#039;s strawberry cough really does clear out a lot of useless worrying I do.<br />From my first purchase to the most recent, The consistency is A+ i.e. Quality, Freshness, Weight, Flavor, Appeal, Stench.<br />Someone stop me, I can go for days. I&#039;m going to have to try his Headband, I&#039;m hearing good things about that strain

				Good to hear! Order for some Headband is comin&#039; up! ;D Glad you are enjoying the Strawberry Cough and that it&#039;s easing your anxiety. Hope you enjoy the Headband just as much! Thank you very much for your review! When you try the Headband why don&#039;t you stop back by and tell us what you think of it here? Look forward to doing more business with ya!<br />TFG
