				At this point you kind of have to quit don&#039;t you? Acid reflux that bad isn&#039;t something to mess around with, unless you want to eat your food through a tube the rest of your life.

				I don&#039;t think that anybody on the SR forums can advise you on your medical condition, as we don&#039;t know your history, or the full extent of your current situation. I DO have an idea where you COULD go to get some real-life medical advice... you need to go to the doctor. Stop taking the pills if you believe they are what&#039;s aggravated everything but if you have an opiate addiction, that&#039;s something else in itself... stopping abruptly to kick the habit while you are spewing up acid-reflux or whatever ... may not be advisable. But yes, if it gets really bad&nbsp; you may even need to go to the hospital or something. Good luck, buddy, keep us posted.

				It&#039;s going to be a tough road but when you successfully kick it will be a great feeling. Even if the damage isn&#039;t totally reversible (which much of it likely will be), you can reverse the damage you WOULD do to yourself in the future by continuing to binge. Good luck, keep us posted!
