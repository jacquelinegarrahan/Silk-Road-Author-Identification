				I tried buying bitcoins from a vendor online, BrianMcGee.&nbsp; I sent him a message and he responded so I bought a $490 moneypak and placed an order yesterday.&nbsp; Now the listing is no longer listed and I think he deleted his vendor page. Can someone advise me on what to do next?&nbsp; How do I contact SR?

				There is no escrow when playing with MoneyPaks.&nbsp; By the way, you placed your order yesterday and everyone was already complaining about being scammed by him days ago.&nbsp; You really should have searched the forum.

Although there are alot of ways to be ripped off on SR it can all be prevented if you just use the protection that is in place. If you cant use escrow then seriously ask yourself if its worth the risk. And dont blame SR for asshole scammers. This service is in place for good reasons and IMO does far more benefiet than damage.

He actually messaged me first out of the blue and said he had several bitcoins to unload for moneypaks and we could both be doing each other a favor by doing the transaction. I just so happened to be looking to get bitcoins this particular evening so&nbsp; I checked his feedback and seller page and he seemed legit and answered all of my messages in minutes. Then, when i got the moneypak he instantly added the funds to his account and cancelled my order. From there he wouldn&#039;t respond to any messages on silkroad or through his tormail account. I am a pretty experienced buyer on the road and i do my homework before buying and I never would have placed an order with him had he not messaged me first and shown such good communication. The only reason I used him was because my normal bitcoin vendor Vicuous86 was backlogged and told me he&nbsp; wouldnt be able to process my order for a while and when brian mcgee contacted me saying he would have the coins to me within minutes i jumped on the opportunity. Long story short he scammed me just like all of the others on here that have told their story. And to make it worse he is bolstering his own feedback with bullshit feedback of people saying he did great and got them their coins when he obviously is the one with other accounts generating this fake feedback. Please everyone who has been scammed by him report him and tell your story so enough will get through to the silk road admins and this piece of shit won&#039;t be able to scam anyone again. We all have to work together to get scammers off this site.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177954.msg1287827#msg1287827">Quote from: Harmful Hits on June 29, 2013, 05:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">yea this guy got me for $2000 in bitcoins i sent him. then he starts really boasting and he replys to my tormail with a message saying he scams all the time and hes been doing it for almost 2 years. He said he has ran about 2 dozen accounts and he alreeady had 2 others ready before he started scamming on this one. Then he says that with my $2,000 he stole in total on brianmcgee so far $23,500 then he takes pictures of all the cash and mails them and so i instantly see it automatically because he was a contact and i saw the image the second i opened the email. From what it sounds like this person works all day scamming and they have alot of money they are investing in scams. you can bet he will be scamming again soon and im sure he must already have a vendor, he told me it was a few months old and hes been working on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Have exchanged mp with mdpro 3 times, and all transactions(included pm, so there was no escrow involved. He has come through within 15 minutes tops for me. That also includes several purchases of product as well in very fast delivery time as well. If you look him up you want see this mp for btc listed, but if you see any product he has listed that you are interested in, i would let him know that you will be purchasing his product with btc he sends. No guarantee he will do this for you if you have no transaction hisrory with him, but he&#039;ll at least tell you know without taking your money and run. Hope this helps and please update with me on here or pm. Nobody wants to get burned, and i can tell you as a man it almost would make me wanna cry if that happened to me. Karmas real, but not everyone here believes in it unfortunately. Just pm that you wanna trade btc for mp and see if that option is available toyou. Lemme know. Hope this helps you.

				By the way, this asshole sent me a message, probably sent multiple times at once to many others apparrently. Another option is localbitcoins. Look it up for your area and if it is available you can buy btc from people face to face with a meetup in public place and with your computers you can do transaction right then and there no problem. Just bring your laptop or cell phone and can verify transfer of btc right then and there. That was one way i&#039;ve done it, and that&#039;s scamfree the way it&#039;s set up. Like i said you are face to face and if the guy tries to give you a bs line like you have to wait a couple of hours thats when you tell him no deal. If he stilldoesn&#039;t give you your moneyback, then quietly but stealthy come across the table and wrap your arms around his neck and tell him you will choke the living shit out of him if you don&#039;t give back your money to which he will promptly do so. Lol just kidding. But seriously, look up mdpro, pm him, or try local bitcoins to buy your btc in person. Don&#039;t give anybody on sr your number no matter how convincing they sound. Especially if they are advertising btc for mp, etc<br />I really hope this helps you and that i&#039;m glad you seem to be getting a refund on your moneypak. Can&#039;t think of too many other worse things to happen to somebody in need of something to turn around and get ripped off.
