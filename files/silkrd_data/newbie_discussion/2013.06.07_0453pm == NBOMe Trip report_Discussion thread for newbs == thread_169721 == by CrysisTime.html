				There is a NBOMe thread in the off topic forum, but, I wanted ot write a trip report for tyl3r durden, and couldn&#039;t find anything in the newbie forum through the search function, sorry if I missed it. I will be using levels of &quot;psychedelic experience&quot; to give an idea where I thought I was add. Highest we achieved was [3]<br /><br />Seller: Tyl3r Durden http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b8da404fa1<br />Product: 25x NBOMe<br />Asked for a selection of 10x 25C-NBOMe 800mcg, 10x 25i-NBOMe 900mcg, 5x 25i-NBOMe 1200mcg.<br />No extra cost for having a selection, got them for 0.19 Bitcoins if I remember correctly. (About 60p per blotter)<br /><br />Background: Never taken any psychedelics before, this seemed to have good responses with people, and was dirt cheap, so I decided to give it a go. I was going to trip with a friend, who had once done Salvia. <br /><br />Drug taken: 25C-NBOMe 800mcg, blotter.<br />Administration: Blotter placed between upper lip and gum.<br />Blotter placed: 5:15pm, removed after 40 minutes at 5:45pm.<br /><br />We started a timer from when we removed the blotter. But, for the benefit of the report I&#039;ll make time 0:00 for when we were putting in the blotter.<br /><br />0:00 - Blotter inserted<br /><br />0:30 - starting to see small effects, nothing significant, friend went to toilet around this point, took out his phone, and was sat there for 10 minutes just letting it kick in, had a clich√© moment of wshing his face in the bathroom, looking in the mirror and going &quot;Holy shit&quot; [1]<br /><br />0:40 - blotter removed. We started a timer on my iPhone at this point to give us an idea of time, what points we were at, and how fucked our perception of time was.<br /><br />0:45 I start seeing shadows on the wall forming images, these shadows would be really blurred, then becoming very defined images,&nbsp; initially it was random images like kaleidoscope-like images, and Egyptian shit, (more than likely because i read a trip report of someone seeing Egyptian shadows and this probably affected what I expected to see), it then changed to shadows forming more large images, and would then slide down the wall, these images were guitars, music notes, and other bits and bobs. [2]<br /><br />1:00 Colours started becoming more intense, and there were more images everywhere in the room, We had a very soft fluffy blanket in the room, which has rose prints on them lots of different colours, I had been lying that across me, and the colours were amazing! After a while the image of the flower was lost as the colours mixed into one another. [2]<br /><br />1:15 - We start putting on music when our sober friend goes upstairs, I wanted to show him the &quot;Dub side of the moon&quot;, a reggae dub version of Dark side of the moon (Listened to both when sober, and I think it&#039;s a nice spin on the original album) We started by playing Time by Floyd, then time in the reggea dub version. [2]<br /><br />1:30 - We are finding it difficult to stick to one point, keep jumping to new ideas, Euphoric, I think at this point I was in fits of laughter, literally crying at one point in happiness, the bets way I could explain it is throughout the next 2 hours emotions become extreme,&nbsp; the smallest funny thing turned us to fits of laughter, my friend mentioned spiders at point, and I (I hate spiders) Felt scared as shit. Told him to shut it and change the subject. It&#039;s good to have another person tripping with you, so you can bounce off one another.<br /><br />From this point time doesn&#039;t really... work. Haha. I didn&#039;t keep a close eye on my clock at this time, all I can tell you is:<br /><br />2:40-3:00 - peak trip for us, at level 3 easily. We were stimulated like fuck and running about shouting ideas at each other giggling our tits off.<br /><br />Now, what happened between 2:00&nbsp; and 3:30ish is a bit of a mess, but the following ideas came into our heads:<br /><br />Fun stuff:<br />The room started to &quot;expand&quot; it&#039;s difficult to explain, but imagine a square, and each line becomes curved an going outwards, making it like a big cushion. The room we were in started doing that.<br /><br />Moving hands across face cause heavy colour visuals. I remember my sock had a small blue colour on the tip, I could move my sock and create a blue light effect where it had gone.<br /><br />We went to my back garden, admired the plants, the trees, my friend started talking about the row of houses, and something about capitalism. We said some really weird shit this is my fav:<br /><br />Friend: Tells me a story about a spider he trapped (as said earlier, I was freaking out about him saying the word spider, i#&#039;d be fine sober I think I was scared where the trip might turn), and couldn&#039;t survive, he couldn&#039;t be bothered to kill it, or free it, so he left it, saying how he&#039;s left that spider to either struggle and not escape or die<br /><br />Me: Man, are you thinking what I&#039;m thinking?<br /><br />Friend: That to that spider I am like, god. I can control it, I am everything it depends on<br /><br />Me: ....The iraq war I was thinking but that&#039;s also fair....<br />We had a good giggle about that.<br /><br />Bad points:<br /><br />I hallucinated some points which freaked me out, but nothing significant, my trip partner helped me out, said how he didn&#039;t have any negative hallucinations, but here are mine:<br /><br />Getting scared of Reddit. Yeah. We went on /r/tripsit, and I turned the screen on it&#039;s side to see all the letter start slipping down, which was cool, but when I put the screen down, the titles started getting bigger and bigger, in the corner of my eye they just started getting huge, freaked me out, I closed the screen lid.<br /><br />The nice blanket with awesome colours had small fibres, my friend saw them as small alveoli, and that the blanket was breathing, I saw maggot like movement in the fiberes, which was weird, it didn&#039;t freak me out but I couldn&#039;t have it on me anymore.<br /><br />Indifferent: at one point it honestly felt like the world behind me was breaking away and that I could only step forward, which didn&#039;t scare me honestly, but weird.<br /><br />My friend got heavy nostalgia at one point, which was enjoyable.<br /><br />I urinated at around the peak tripping point, the warm feeling washing through your body, I ended up going number in my fingers and dick, couldn&#039;t feel it, the world started blacking out and colours started taking over. As I finished pissing, I was back to normal, probably will sit down next time I need a trip piss.<br /><br />4:00 - Come down, we&#039;re still level 3, but we are able to sit in one place without walking around the house, we put on more music, and chilled, enjoying the colours, how the music changed the room, the sun was setting at this point, the room had a nice warm feeling.<br /><br />5:00- 7:00. We were hitting level 2 now, colours were still intense, and the iPhone icons still danced whenever we looked at them, the colourful pshyacelic images were still lovely to look at, but less significant hallucinations.<br /><br />7-8 hours, Level 1. We just chatted about politics and stuff for the last few hours.<br /><br />I found it rather difficult to sleep, for multiple reason, it was light outside, as we had been talking until about 4am (11 hours from admin-ish), didn&#039;t sleep until 5am-6am.<br /><br />In short:<br /><br />Pros: <br />Amazing visuals,<br />Clear head (which was nice because whenever I hallucinated something I wasn&#039;t fond of, I could reason with myself I was just tripping balls, also useful with dealing with pizza guy), <br />Didn&#039;t get heavy body load that others experienced, we were running about like squirrels for hours, just tired after because of that.<br />I woke up at about 3pm. But currently no hangover. Which is nice.<br />The price. 60p for an amazing time!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not much spiritual effect, but that&#039;s fine as I was more looking for a fun eye candy experience.<br />Can&#039;t think of much else.<br /><br /><br />A part of me wanted to write down what we were experiencing, but as a first trip I just wanted to experience everything fore what it was. So at about 4am before sleeping I made a small bullet point list, which I wrote this off, but I have missed so much, because it&#039;s impossible to talk about everything, but you must experience a trip if you haven&#039;t before. And if you&#039;re looking for hevay visual fun, 25C is your drug.<br /><br />Thanks Tyl3R!
