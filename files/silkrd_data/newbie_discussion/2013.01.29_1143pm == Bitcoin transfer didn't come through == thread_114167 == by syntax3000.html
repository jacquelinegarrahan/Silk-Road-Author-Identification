				Have you checked the blockchain by looking up the wallet address you sent from. That will show you all movement from your address to see if the funds were moved.

It has never taken longer than a few hours for me for as long as I have used SR (three months). <br /><br /><br />Entity

				I&#039;ve used this same address i used more than a year ago. Everything was ok then but this time it&#039;s not showing up. I&#039;ve checked the blockchain and it shows my transfer, it also shows my transfer from a year ago. I&#039;ve checked my wallet and i have 665 conformations. So the transfer has been made 100% sure, it&#039;s just not showing up in my account.

				Man you have to be a little more patient. Plan ahead. There is millions of dollars a year going through here. Sometimes it takes an hour or less, sometimes it takes 14 hours.
