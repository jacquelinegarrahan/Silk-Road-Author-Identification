				I&#039;m not trying to be douchey here, but how can you advertise &quot;15% fee&quot; like it&#039;s some kind of deal?&nbsp; Blue Sky charged me ~3.5% (their fees might have increased since then).&nbsp; And I found a localbitcoin.com guy who&#039;ll do MtGox last price plus 2%.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand the &quot;15% fee until I get my stats up&quot; remark, shouldn&#039;t it be like &quot;2% fee until I get my stats up&quot;?&nbsp; Why are we supposed to pay egregious fees until you &quot;get your stats up&quot;?&nbsp; Don&#039;t understand.

				well that was a waste of my fucking time. Thank You White Out, Domesticdrops.&nbsp; Great start.<br /><br />I try to give a new vendor a chance and opportunity to defend himself against being called a scammer and he cancels my order and says he&#039;s moving, has no internet!!!&nbsp; A vendor can&#039;t grab a wifi hotspot for 60 quid for emergency&#039;s???!!!&nbsp; And he wants us to order drugs from him... LOL <br />How the fuck did he PM me w/out internet.&nbsp; futere lesson, someone comes on a board to defend you,(you asked on your vendor profile page) and then goes ahead and places an order,&nbsp; risking my own coin to give you a chance to prove the haters wrong and you bow out.&nbsp; Dude, even if you couldn&#039;t process another transaction you should have done this one, any amount would have shown you were up to the task. <br />WEAK<br /><br />he sent me that msg but it was SR support that sent me notice of my order being canceled., only happend once before, is it always SR support?<br /><br />I wanted to support him but he is obviously NOT READY to be a vendor. Not even close.&nbsp; Sorry if the truth hurts.&nbsp;
