				I haven&#039;t heard of any such circumstances and that seems like something that would be posted about.&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s possible but I doubt it&#039;s very probable.

				If the seller makes a little effort to hide it, it&#039;s most unlikely it gets seized imo.

				Here&#039;s something I learned from a man who trains police dogs.&nbsp; He said dogs are mainly trained to do one thing.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not like they train every dog to be able to sniff out explosives, coke, meth, weed, etc.&nbsp; There are dogs for explosive sniffing and then there are drug dogs which are trained by the police officers stuffing drugs into the dog&#039;s chew toys.&nbsp; The dogs are essentially always looking for their toys.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they go nuts when they walk by my car.&nbsp; They think their toy is in there but in actuality I just have an oz. of weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />True story, one time I got pulled over literally seconds after smoking a blunt.&nbsp; They sent dogs all up in my car to see if they could find my stash that I had hidden in a good spot.&nbsp; The dog was too confused and overwhelmed by the blunt I had just smoked to find it.&nbsp; And it was not like inside the engine or tire or something it was in the &quot;cockpit&quot; if you will.&nbsp; They ended up finding one solitary seed and almost took me to county.&nbsp;

				Dogs are trained to smell most drugs, however that doesn&#039;t mean they will detect your package. Most vendors on here will pack it so no smell escapes, which ensures a safe delivery past customs. Sending within the EU should be completely safe.
