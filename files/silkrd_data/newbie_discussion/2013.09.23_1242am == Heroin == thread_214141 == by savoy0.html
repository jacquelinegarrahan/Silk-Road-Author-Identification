				im getting 4 bitcoins today or tomorrow morning. and trying to decide what to order... i really want to get a gram of some good goood good shit.. i really wanted to order from dragoncove... but he just ran out it looks like so im looking either at Gotsitall or Nowthatsthestuff.... anyone have any ideas ... i dont no if i want to go through supremesmoke or freeway they are really pricey and it seems like kind of a little to high.... anyone have any suggestions i mean im willing to go with what the majority of people have to say.. also for the left over i think im going to use dieseltherapy to get Blue diamond and normal grams ... ive tried both and they are decent but for the price its awesome.

				Wait for the following:<br /><br />Subsrgood<br />CarlitosBrigante<br /><br /><br />Subs is taking a few days off right now. Carlitos is taking a day or two off at the moment as well. Both are great vendors with excellent product.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t wait go for :<br />GotsItAll (though there is a new insurance policy that sucks)<br />DragonCove<br />SupremeSmoke<br /><br />Don&#039;t go for stamps. NTTS had shipping issues but I think sorted them out. Haven;t tried though. <br /><br />Check out the H thread in rumor mill. Read that back a few days and you&#039;ll be an expert in no time. It kind of has tides, rises and falls, a constant background amount, etc

It&#039;s been two weeks and I haven&#039;t received it yet, was told by vendor that it takes 8 to 12 working days. Very much looking forward to what everybody says is worth the extra money.... Very pricey, but I&#039;ll pay for the quality. Hopefully it gets here today, I ordered a half gram. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had great luck with surpremesmoke in the past. No complaints about quality or shipping times. You&#039;ll get a consistent product and top shelf service for the extra cost. Very high quality. <br /><br />I would recommend looking at mrgood247 also. He&#039;s a newer vendor, but the prices are lower than most and the quality is top notch. Very similar to supremesmoke. I&#039;d even say it&#039;s the same stuff, but cheaper. mrgood247 was great to work with on my first round with him, I can only hope that over time he maintains his consistency and quality and fast shipping, and he&#039;ll be right up there with supremesmoke and the rest of the top vendors. <br /><br />The other vendors you mentions I haven&#039;t tried. I have a pending order with nowthatsthestuff, but haven&#039;t seen it yet (I&#039;m big on the variety life has to offer, I&#039;d try it all if I could... :))<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				regarding mrgood247, he has good communication, and some previous positive feedback, but it seems all/most all of the tracking #&#039;s he sent out are not popping up in USPS&#039;s system yet. At least mine has not. He&#039;s saying that because its the weekend they aren&#039;t showing up yet. Could be usps fucking up, could just be a dcn, idk. Seems kind of odd that a systemic failure of tracking #&#039;s to run through usps&#039;s system happened, or that they don&#039;t update priority express on the weekends. <br /><br />I ordered: September 20, 2013, 11:08 pm UTC<br />It was marked in transit: September 21, 2013, 7:12 am UTC<br /><br />Before the saturday cutoff i would assume for usps express priority. As well, he said the tracking #&#039;s would go out in a few hours, after i messaged him ~12hrs after the order. That did not happen, 15hrs ago i requested a #, and got it within an hour. But, once again its not in usps&#039;s system.<br /><br />At this point, i am reserving judgement. Its just now monday on the east coast, usps could be fucking up like they usually do, it could just be a dcn #, or a mistake in the #. Or a # of other factors. <br /><br />Besides his listings are all pulled due to high demand. The whole FE sale thing seems a bit odd, and could potentially be a scam, but i doubt it based off his prior feedback. <br /><br />Anyone else in the same boat as me?<br /><br />Really anxious, I ran out of heroin yesterday, and have been consuming copious amounts of kratom, water, cannabis, clonidine, benzos, alcohol, and a bit of tetrahydropalmatine to stave off the w/d&#039;s but its still a bitch. Hope the package arrives monday morning. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had heroin from einsten777, supremesmoke, carlitosbrigante(aka marlostanfield), and a few others i can&#039;t remember. 58 total transactions on the road. Those listed vendors will take care of you. I&#039;m taking a chance here with mrgood, but its in escrow just in case. Still, might order from another vendor as a backup plan.<br /><br />

I&#039;m not sure when on Monday it was available, I just know it wasn&#039;t available before I left for work in the AM but was available in the afternoon when I got home. <br /><br />USPS.com had given me a projected delivery date, and they missed it by a day. It came the next day. Clearly not mrgood247&#039;s fault though, it was lagged up at some postage facility for a day. <br /><br />I know when I had questions about my order he was extremely forthcoming and easy to communicate with. I got good vibes from him, and felt like he&#039;s an honest vendor. As for his FE special, I was going to try that out next time I used him, because it&#039;s significant savings and the first transaction went so well... We&#039;ll see though. Good luck, hope it gets there for you on time! <br /><br />Personally, I keep a few strips of 8mg suboxone on hand so I can avoid getting sick. The w/d&#039;s after using suboxone for a couple days isn&#039;t nearly as bad as cold turkey. Works for me anyways.

				I would avoid NTTS until we get some more people on the forum(legit 50+ post) to give honest feedback about&nbsp; him. Myself and a few others have had orders not arrive. My has been 7 days for priority and he has asked me for my address twice and refuses to directly answer my question about when my order will arrive. Another user waited 14 days and was asked three times for his address before giving up. A third says he got his stuff EVENTUALLY but it was inconsistent with some of it being ALL cut and other parts being well above average. <br />He had a personal issue three weeks ago but has not settled several problem orders but is now offering stuff at discounted prices while keeping the others waiting. There is no evidence that it is a scam but there is also no evidence that it is not. I will update a review thread if he fixes my order and/or actually clearly informs me of what is going on.&nbsp; There are too many other good vendors to take silly risks.

				yeah, so the tracking finally came up. <br /><br />It was dropped off at 9am this morning. Not shipped saturday.<br /><br />Fucking asshole. I had my order in before the cutoff friday, this is bullshit. <br /><br />I better get a refund on the shipping, or he&#039;s not getting a 5/5 feedback score. I don&#039;t give a shit if i get banned from ordering again.<br /><br />Be a man, be honest, and tell me you did not have time to ship it on sat, and it will go out on monday. Now i get to be sick for two more days.<br /><br />stay away from mrgood247, i really fucking hate liars.

I think that probably varies from user to user. Personally, I find it helps me out because I have to plan so far ahead of time, helps me from doing anything stupid when I shouldn&#039;t. If I have to wait, then I plan it ahead of time and if I&#039;m planning, I usually plan on doing it right, not finding myself strung out after six days of hitting it too hard. If I&#039;m buying from my buddy up the road, I&#039;ll likely call him at 3am on a worknight and get all sorts of way too high when I should be sleeping it off. <br /><br />If you have a local guy that you trust with good stuff, by all means, that&#039;s probably your best option. The road is for a bigger variety and more consistency. <br /><br />When was the last time you saw the crushable OC&#039;s on the street? Those are here too. Pricey, but they are here at least. Before I knew about this place, I would have paid triple what they ask for here for an old school 80, just for nostalgia really. But the high is also pretty great. <br /><br />This thread you posted is in a specific, pre-existing thread, for &quot;Heroin&quot;. What you want to do is start another thread and ask some of these same questions, do that from the Index screen. That will open yourself up to more people who can give you better answers than I can. The only people that will see this are the people opening up the Heroin only thread. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Emoney, drugs are almost always more expensive on The Road. People buy them here for higher purity, convenience and lower profile. Where I live I would draw a lot of attention buying H in most areas of town, plus I am at the mercy of getting ripped off or busted. <br /><br />If I am smart and disciplined, I have almost no risk here and the extra money is well spent. That being said, I still have a street connection because every once in a while, everything on The Road goes wrong and I have to wait a while for my shit.
