				get a lawyer immediately, public defender if nothing else. It&#039;s all going to hinge on if you can fight the search and seizure&#039;s they performed as lacking probable cause or sufficient standing to get a warrant. DON&#039;T SAY SHIT! get rid of this post, if LE is on here and they read it you are triple fucked. If you can get electronic info thrown out and don&#039;t say shit, you&#039;ll be good.

				Never plead guilty Hermano, Especially when they would Love to make you the first American to get busted and shown to the world as a Silk Road user, they will Fucking hang you out to dry In the Media and fist fuck your future, Lawyer up this fucking Instant and get a Real Slick one too, and make sure he is not friendly with the Feds. Find out Exactly balls deep you are Legally. Talk to the Lawyer about the damage limitation you can do, I think you&#039;ll be Ok, if you are on prescribed medication check KNOWN side effects of ANY meds you take, Lots have mental side Effects with memory loss ETC and you can&#039;t remember ordering anything online, but you have let friends us your computer to go on Facebook, and by the looks of it must have Sinned and started ordering drugs to your shared Residence, you trusted the people in your SHARED residence, and they used you, don&#039;t dump someone in shit, they could be regular couch surfers that you know on first name only, Fuck the Bullshit potential Is limitless lol<br /><br />Yes they have your &quot;Texts&quot;, but they don&#039;t have the product directly attached to YOU.<br /><br />Texts as Evidence,&nbsp; that&#039;s a hard sell for a conviction, they cant prove the drugs chemical compounds from Texts, so you could have been knowingly handling &quot;Legal Highs&quot;, and simply selling them on, only marketing them as other products to increase your sales, LEGALLY. Again, different angle depending on the Evidence they have. <br /><br />You do not want to admit this site was used by you for sure, you will become a media darling. Bitcoin and Silk road = Story = You being made an Example of this wont be good for you . <br />&nbsp; <br />Most Important, Stay calm as you can,&nbsp; There is always someone more fucked than You. Good Luck.&nbsp; I am Not your legal aid, You can do as you please, Just do not destroy your life by confessing all. <br /><br />Peace

				Never talk to LE. <br />If they keep questioning you after your initial statement &quot;I have no idea what you are talking about&quot;,<br />ask if you are being charged. If you are make sure your Miranda rights are read/spoken to you and <br />SHUT the fuck up! tell them you are uncomfortable answering any more questions and lawyer up.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Good luck bud.<br />Things to learn...<br />1. don&#039;t send Especially WEED to your dorm... especially not in qp&#039;s. dorms don&#039;t offer privacy, qp&#039;s are too bulky, has to be stored in a general area which can smell.<br />2. use a burner (trac phone). don&#039;t talk about shit on the phone. if the people you wanna talk to really needs to know, email and pgp or predefined codewords / made up language is also good.<br />3. don&#039;t access tor from dorms, the school watches everything you do.<br />I don&#039;t even know how to begin explaining about that situation..<br />Let us know how everything progresses.

				Keep your mouth shut...<br /><br />Lawyer Up...<br /><br />Let your attorney do his job....<br /><br />They will try and scare you into talking.... The less they have the harder they will press you. Just realize nothing you say can be used to help you. You have plausible deniability when a package is sent to you. Unless you signed for the package you should beat the case with a decent lawyer. As long as you don&#039;t talk your way into trouble. If they didn&#039;t have a search warrant, then you shouldn&#039;t have allowed them to enter. If they entered without a warrant, and without your permission, the computers and phone evidence should get thrown out in court. They will bluff hard, don&#039;t fall for it. You should be fine if you handle it correctly. <br /><br />
