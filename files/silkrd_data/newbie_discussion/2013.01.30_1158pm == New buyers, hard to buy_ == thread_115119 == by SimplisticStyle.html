				I understand that sellers have a risk when shipping to new buyers. But how are we supposed to earn feedback when some sellers won&#039;t even sell to you because of your feedback? I placed a few orders for a few different types of gear. My first order I placed two orders with the same vendor and he canceled half because he wants to start off small with new buyers (which is totally understandable and I appreciate him/her selling to me at all and I can place a 2nd order once I finished my first) However another seller just flat out canceled on me without no explanation or anything (SupremeSmoke). I am in the process of finding another seller that will give me the chance to at least start off small to replace him. I hope to have my feedback looking great with multiple purchases very quickly. I can say though, if I find a premium product and a seller that is willing to deal with me to replace that order than I will stick with that seller and SupremeSmoke will have just lost a valuable repeat customer.<br /><br />Anybody else having any trouble buying? Any tips on improving my stats or helping insure trust in me as a buyer?

				You are more likely to have success buying small things. <br /><br />Most newbies now must swallow the pill of having to buy porn or something, but the sellers can see you haven&#039;t spent much. It is a trust thing. A scammer is not likely to spend the time to build a reputation. <br /><br />The other way around it is to find new vendors and you can both help each other out...

				I&#039;ve noticed several weed dealers not requiring FE for their orders. Might be a good place to start if you like smoking.

				Well, my first few orders that I have placed will bring me to 4 transactions and 500.00 spent. As long as these new vendors I have chosen don&#039;t cancel on me. I am only here to try and find premium quality over what I can get local. I can only hope I don&#039;t have to make a bunch of small purchases of stuff I don&#039;t even want just to earn some trust lol. I don&#039;t mind a FE however the vendor that canceled on me (SupremeSmoke) did not even give me that oppurtunity

A little nervous but it made it here after like a month (got stuck in customs for a bit, I had tracking for my order and it was so annoying to see that it was still chilling in customs) but it made it to me eventually and was incredible.

				i had a similar problem last week when my stats only had 3 purchases. a few hundred dollars worth of 25i. i treid to place a order for a o of shrooms and they cancelled on me saying they were fresh out and it wouldnt be til march till they had some. i made 2 more purchases and recieved items in same week so iwas up to 5. they messaged me back saying they had a o of shrooms for me they found. i was like whatever. i ordered 5 more items since then and 2 have arrived so im up to 7. i have no intention of scamming anybody. im just trying to make some money. anyways one of my other orders was from a newer vendor who only had like 12 transactions when i ordered,he had an intro sale selling shrooms for like $103 an oz. i bought 2 since he had great reviews from the previous 12 transactions on the items page and everybody agreed they were about 30grams in each oz. so now i got a great price on 25i and i will def be a repeat customer for the shroom guy. i mean if your a good vendor who was going to actually send it and you had a great track record then y would u be concerned about a guy with a few transactions under his belt attempting to rip u off for $160?now checking today the same shroom guy has 16 overwieght 5/5 trans.

				I did notice SupremeSmoke took his C ad&#039;s down. So maybe he was out of product? Well i have a few items in transit so hopefully these get here fast enough that I can get some good ratings under my belt and not have to worry about this for future orders. But I also agree, give the new guys a shot even if its starting off with something smaller. You never, they might become your number one buyer!

				I have heard about the troubles that some buyers have at the start. I was actually looking at buying a decent size of LSD for my first transaction. However, it would likely have to be a FE. Does anyone think there would be an issue? He seems to be a legit vendor (Lucydrop) and his page doesn&#039;t say anything about restrictions for newbies.

				There are a lot of options. <br />1) finalize early - you&#039;ll want to make sure the vendor is very reputable and has a large number of transactions. <br />2) shop around - unless you want a product that doesn&#039;t have many vendor options, you should be able to find vendors who don&#039;t have restrictions.<br />3) buy silly stuff to get your stats up - I&#039;d rather take the other options.

				I think I was relatively lucky with who I dealt with when I first joined, which was not actually that long ago (3+ months). I went straight in on the expensive stuff buying mostly cocaine and didn&#039;t even get asked to FE (probably because it was UK to UK). I got scammed once when I FE&#039;d early to someone and then never received the product and he didn&#039;t reply to me, but that was after quite a few transactions rather than being new; just a stupid mistake. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m allowed to name the vendor on here but he&#039;s still selling and his feedback is 80. I&#039;ve been told he&#039;s a &#039;selective&#039; scammer.<br /><br />Anyway keep at it, you have nothing to lose trying to buy as long as you don&#039;t FE and don&#039;t come across as a dick.<br /><br />

				Traded under full escrow for first purchase, supposedly because I asked the vendor through PM and they were happy that I took the time to message them. YMMV
