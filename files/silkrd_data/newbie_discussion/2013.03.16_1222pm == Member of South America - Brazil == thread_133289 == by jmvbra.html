				Tyrion, how much time do you usually wait to receive your orders? I&#039;m waiting a non registered package for 32 days. The seller said orders usually takes 40-50 days to ship to South America, but I&#039;m worried about waiting this much.

				Even legal products without tracking from the EU dont always make it to South America just one of those things.

				Hey guys, this is for the brazilians, if you could give me any tips. I ordered a shipment of 25iNBOMe to the Northeast region(Nordeste). Shit is, it&#039;s been 15 days and nothing. I&#039;m fairly sure the vendor sent the package, and according to him it should have arrived by now. So I guess maybe they found it at correios. Think it&#039;s just too early, and it will still arrive? If not, does anyone know if 25iNBOMe is illegal in Brazil yet? Cause it definitely looks like LSD, blotters, but it isn&#039;t. So in theory you could just go to correios, tell them what it is and ask for the stuff. I&#039;m thinking they would probably arrest you anyway, and until you could prove it&#039;s not LSD you would be in trouble. I still have some hope that it could arrive, like maybe to the Northeast the delivery takes longer, I don&#039;t know. The vendor seems like a pro, so his stealth gets through in other strict countries like Australia or Russia. The address is correct too so... Well I would appreciate any advice.&nbsp;

				15 days is no reason to worry, i&#039;ve had orders that took 2 months +. Actually 7 out of 8 orders took at least 50 days. Even legal stuff eventually take way too long to arrive over here. Its known that we have a slow postal service and a slow custom (alfandêga). Chill, there wont be a problem. I&#039;ve even had poor stealth stuff come clear and intact.<br />spread the love

				From the U.K and speak some Spanish &amp; Portuguese and would agree on the similarities, Royal Mail in the U.K usually takes a couple of weeks to Brazil sent airsure.

LSD is a little more common, but you need to know the right guys. The drugs that are more easy to find on the streets are cannabis, that is horrible quality, cocaine and crack.<br /><br />the prices are looks like (taking into account the current price of the dollar):<br /><br />1g MDMA - R$ 200,00 = $85 <br />1 blotter - R$ 30,00 = $12<br />25 blotter - R$ 625,00 = $265<br /><br />i think that the LSD prices on the streets are looking like the price in SR, but with MDMA it is much better buy online, because the price and mainly for quality.<br /><br />Peace.<br />

				Hello how long,<br /><br />First 1 - Sorry for the delay and lack of feedback from shopping!<br /><br />According 2 - Be careful for less than six months, thousands of news came out about DeepWeb in our country (Brazil) / (newspaper, television, internet, social networking) probably SR tb! So be careful!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br />My Feedback;<br /><br />1 - 20 to 25 days on average is arrived products.<br /><br />2 - The packages are always very creative so are not tracked by our customs.<br /><br />3 - No need to sign, comes with regular mail.<br /><br />4 - LSD comes easy.<br /><br />5 - Marijuana and Hashish are very funny packaging, congratulations for sellers! Chew well!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br /><br />Nice to see how the community of Latin America and especially Brazil is strengthening, need more information as our customs work!

				Yeah, a lot of people say that BraSil is bad to ship, that our post office do lost / stole / wrong handling shit. That&#039;s bullshit and excuse to some vendors scam brazilians. Like HoffmanBR received its package about 9 days! I receive a lot of packages, of course i only buy with tracking, which is very hard, as a lot of vendors-scammers don&#039;t like to sell, as they know you will have a proof that wasn&#039;t sent. Even a package of mine that arrived, got paid for tracking but the seller sent without it, and it was e very rated seller...

				Galera, como vocês devem ter percebido o Silk Road foi &quot;apreendido&quot; pelo FBI.<br /><br />Todos os endereços do pessoal que compra são deletados após o pedido ser finalizado, mas quem estava com pedidos abertos podem ter seus endereços ainda no servidor. Acho que a gente não deve se preocupar com isso já que o Brasil está fora de jurisdição do FBI. O máximo que pode acontecer é eles enviarem esses endereços para a polícia aqui no Brasil, e o máximo que a polícia pode fazer é ir de endereço em endereço com um mandado de busca e entrar na casa do pessoal a procura de drogas.<br /><br />Eu acho isso muito improvável, mas por via das dúvidas, tirem qualquer droga ou parafernalha relacionada de suas casas!
