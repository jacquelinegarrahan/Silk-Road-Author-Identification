				I&#039;m a newb, so be wary of my advice, but I would keep as little of my money in BitCoin wallets or online BitCoin exchanges and instead only move the approximate amount of cash to bitcoin-&gt;SR for each purchase or group of purchases.<br /><br />but I dunno wtf I am talking about.&nbsp; ;)<br />There are great threads on this subject if you use search or browse the Security sub-forum.

				If they&#039;re not in your own control then it&#039;s a matter of how much you trust the person / company who has them. Would you trust anyone other than a bank to keep hold of your money? Because that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Having said that MtGox is probably the safest because if MtGox go down or are hacked then the worth of your bitcoins will plummet anyway. The entire market is centralized around this one currency exchange, it really is the weakest point in the bitcoin system at the moment because it&#039;s the place where the price is set.<br /><br />If you keep a lot of BTC there then make sure you have both a strong password that you don&#039;t use anywhere else, two factor authentication would be ideal, and remember that your coin is only as safe as the most insecure computer that it can or has been accessed from.<br /><br />Finally, unless you&#039;re a computer security legend then YOU are probably the weakest link in the chain. Your security practices, the games and software you pirate, the porno you download, the adverts on the dodgy sites you visit, the links you click on in emails and so on. It&#039;s a dangerous series of tubes out there, use appropriate protection.

				I keep mine on SR for the sole reason of that it takes like an hour to get it from bitcoin-central to my SR wallet. So, yeah. If it goes down, I&#039;d only ever really lose 30-40 bucks anyway, so meh.

				If you have any significant amount then you are better off to learn how to safely store and back them up yourself.<br />If we are talking about a few $100 then I would probalby just go with blockchain.info

				I advise folks to keep their coins on a legit site (legal-wise) and transfer coins to SR. If you are one of those that can&#039;t wait an hour two for your coins to arrive, then store enough for an order on SR but keep your other coins offsite. While SR does have a deadman&#039;s switch I don&#039;t to risk the cops kicking in the doors one day and all my coins going up in smoke.<br /><br />Also, most of the newbies around here probably weren&#039;t here in the bad old days when the server would be swamped or down and you could not log in to your account. So, if you did need to get your coins out, you couldn&#039;t because you could not even get to the site. While it looks like those days are in the past, I&#039;m sure it could happen again.
