				Recovering or currently in the throes of addiction? I obviously understand that there are a great deal of recreational drug users here on SR, but am curious how many of you suffer from a real physical dependency on your DOC. I am a drug addict in recovery at this time. Heroin. I am currently on a suboxone program and attempting to rebuild the life that heroin destroyed over the past 3 years.

				I just posted in the other thread dmtrip but will repost here.. <br /><br />&quot;thanks dmtrip. I hope you are ok.. especially here! Guessing you stay away from the H and dabble in a bit of the lighter stuff. Good that you can place those boundaries on your usage. It can run away easily.. especially with the SR grocery store. &quot;

				hey dmtrip, saw your reply and thought I&#039;d reply here. <br /><br />That&#039;s good. Generally speaking psychedelics aren&#039;t addictive. This is because they are usually fairly long experiences that can be draining and give you a lot of thinking time. They don&#039;t excite the reward system in the brain the same way, or the immune system like heroin, so the joy of it comes more form the insights and the experience.. and that can sometimes take a while sober to debrief and understand. Definitely not a day to day drug class :)

				I replied in the other thread but will do the same here and quote myself. So that skinnydean can get a little more insight into my situation.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thank you. I&#039;ve recently gotten things under control. On a strict suboxone program, so seeing all the opiates on here doesn&#039;t effect me like it would have previously. Which i am very happy about. I am now trying to stick to my second love when it comes to drugs. Psychedelics.&nbsp; :D Time to expand my mind instead of isolating it like i was doing when i was putting the needle in my arm.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />skinnydean, i&#039;m not sure if you are familiar with suboxone but it is an opiate blocker. So if I were to use, it would be a waste of my money because i wouldn&#039;t get high. So that greatly helps with the temptation of relapsing. And the suboxone is an opiate itself (a strong one too) so that takes care of the cravings. Once i get some coin, ill be using SR to purchase mostly psychedelics. Definitely staying off of the opiate listings.

				Hey man, I&#039;ve been down the road you&#039;re talking of, and whether i&#039;m completely off it is debatable :)<br /><br />Smoked weed everyday for 6 years, and this is when some of you might say that &quot;hey man, it&#039;s just weed, that stuff wont kill you!&quot; ...well, trying to finish an education while smoking on a daily basis is not a good combination... at least not for me. I&#039;ve had plenty of friends who are doing fine studying and smoking at the same time, getting good grades and all that jazz, these people became my idols...<br /><br />...But then one day, i got caught redhanded with the ridiculous amount of 1.2g of weed on me in a random search. I got a huge fine and an even bigger eye opener. At first I was like &quot;FUCK ALL COPS!! I HATE YOU ALL....all that jazz&quot; ..but after a few days of calming down i sought professional help. It&#039;s been little over a year now, i finished my education, got extremely good grades compared to when I was in the weed haze and I&#039;m now waiting for the summer to start on the study of my dreams.<br /><br />So all in all, I&#039;ve been a vegetable for 6 years cause of the weed.. don&#039;t follow my example.<br /><br />The downside now though is that i&#039;ll have to wait a few more months to continue my studying, and I&#039;m bored as hell, and ended up on Silk Road :p... i&#039;m staying away from weed, cause I obviously don&#039;t have very good experience in that field, but I&#039;m still fascinated by all the other chemicals in the list which can alter your brain state :D ..so even though I&#039;m not an addict anymore, i&#039;m still really interested in &#039;different experiences&#039;. With that said I&#039;ve learnt an important lesson, and I&#039;m really struggling mentally every time I do drugs, and ask myself repeatedly &quot;so are you an addict now?&quot;.<br /><br />geeesh, i had some stuff bottled up here :)

				I feel you for sure. I know a lot of people laugh at anyone who uses the term &quot;marijuana addiction.&quot; But I know for a fact that you can become addicted to weed. While the marijuana itself does not have any addictive qualities, a person can absolutely become mentally dependent on the high it gives you. You won&#039;t be physically addicted, or dope sick if you don&#039;t smoke. But you can become mentally addicted to weed just as people can become addicted to food, sex, gambling, etc.<br /><br />Good luck to you both, MyOtherNick and charas.

After quitting I couldn&#039;t sleep well for like two months. Woke up like a million times every night, covered in sweat.. But that is probably nothing compared to the more physical drugs though, not sure how the final comedown is for other substances.<br /><br />But yeah, add some social phobia to the mix and a weed habit suddenly makes you a vegetable in every possible way.

				I have a REAL taste for opiates, but have never slipped into a cycle of regular (daily use).&nbsp; I first tried H around 15 years ago and have been a dabbler ever since.&nbsp; Originally me and my mates used it as a come down drug after we&#039;d been out clubbing (and taken ecstasy).&nbsp; An incredible combination, a sweet way to come down.&nbsp; The H gradually got its claws into some of my mates and they became regular users, and a couple are still very much addicted.&nbsp; Thankfully my personality is less addictive so I&#039;ve managed to lead a good life and keep my &quot;taste&quot; in check.<br /><br />The longest I&#039;ve smoked brown for is around 5 days, and as expected I didn&#039;t feel very good for the next 3-4 days.&nbsp; The golden rule (for me) is never do it for more than 1 days (24 hr period), and then try and have a couple of weeks off.&nbsp; Unfortunately, once you&#039;ve got that taste for opiates, it&#039;s hard to forget about them.&nbsp; The SR probably isn&#039;t the best place to be hanging around and it&#039;s given me the opportunity to sample #4 heroin which I&#039;d never had before. Very nice up the nose!<br /><br />Fortunately, the smallest amount of H you can usually buy on SR is 0.5g, and with my &#039;part time&#039; use and lower tolerance this is too much for me. A 0.5g bag is roughly equivalent to 3 x £20 street bags and would have me very battered for about 2-3 days, so I tend to avoid buying this amount unless going halves with a friend.&nbsp; However, I occasionally get cheap 0.2 g samples off vendors.&nbsp; This quantity suits my &quot;24 hour rule&quot; better!<br /><br />So, I suppose I am an addict &#039;of sorts&#039;, but have got things under control. I mainly use the SR for other bits and pieces....&nbsp; E&#039;s, 2CB&#039;s, Dexedrine, etc.&nbsp; To be fair I need to tone everything down, the booze included.&nbsp; Getting a bit too old for all this...&nbsp; ;o)

And it&#039;ll take about a week after you smoked (2 if you smoked ALOT) before it&#039;s all out of your system and your brain reach normal functionality again. So if you smoke every weekend you&#039;ll get just as retarded as someone smoking on a daily basis, even though you will &#039;feel sober&#039; during the week days, it really takes its toll in the longrun.

				I&#039;m clean now, but I spent over a year binging everyday on Mephedrone and then 4 months everyday on MDPV, taking GBL every night to sleep. Quitting sucked, I was angry as fuck 24/7 and felt weird for a good year, but getting off the research stims was the best thing I ever did.

				@PartTimeFiend: I can&#039;t even imagine being a full blown addict like i was just a short time ago and relying on SR shipments for my dope. I&#039;m assuming that your mates have regular street dealers as well. But knowing myself, i would have freaked if i expected a shipment on a certain date and it didnt show. I was for sure an everyday user, with the withdraws hitting around 12-14 hrs after last use. So with that being said, I&#039;m sure you can see why I&#039;m so grateful that the SR was never my dealer.&nbsp; :P I&#039;m really happy to hear that you&#039;ve been able to keep your H use in check. That little bender you spoke of, 5 days of use in a row then 3-4 days of dope sickness, was enough to show you that its not a pretty lifestyle huh. I&#039;m glad.<br /><br />@android465764: I understand what you are saying. But temptations surround me everywhere i go, not just on SR. The town i live in is going thru a heroin epidemic right now. We&#039;ve got 12, 13, 14 year old boys and girls trying the needle for the first time. Overdosing. Just so sad.

				wouldn&#039;t consider myself an addict, but definitely dependent on cannabis and caffeine, which are my daily drugs. I&#039;ve had some experiences with tame opioids in the form of hydrocodone/codeine, and found myself taking them if i had them which led me to cut off my access to them before it became a habit and have me looking for something stronger. I enjoyed the minor 30 mins of bliss they gave me at first, but after 2-3 days use it didn&#039;t even do anything. I&#039;d like to at least try H once or twice to see what the hype is about, but I&#039;m extremely cautious about this as I&#039;ve seen what it can do to people. It&#039;s something I would never want to make a habit out of. SR can definitely be a temptation, but so far I&#039;ve been on here a while and have only bought mdma, herb, 25i, and a handful of stims, and those have been done responsibly.<br /><br />I&#039;m dying to try LSD for the first time, just waiting on the right time and opportunity. I love the variety of herb that&#039;s available, I now have access to the most elite bud in the country, and at much cheaper prices, it makes me respect what we have here. I grow my own mostly, but love the convenience and selection we have here. <br /><br />Good vibes to everyone in here, and those we know who may be struggling with their demons.

				I never considered myself an addict, but I guess I was. I was prescribed opiates for a back problem by my doc and soon became dependent. After about a year of feeling like crap and my<br />need for the drug ever increasing I decided to quit...Withdrawl was terrible of course. Eventually I tapered off using a combination of suboxone and Kratom. You have to be careful as both <br />those can be just as bad as the pain meds! <br />I feel much better now that I&#039;m off the pain meds, and less depressed too. I do enjoy LSD, MJ, and alcohol recreationaly.<br />I try to follow the advice of the ancient Greeks. Everything in moderation!<br /><br />Cheers<br />

				Yes agreed, any drug is OK in moderation. I found with H you generally need to hit rock bottom ie homeless stealing I.V, you slip and you&#039;re self respect goes out of window. I always say if you could show an addict what he/she is going to be like in say 2 years down the line. Most people would be scared witless of turning into a full blown addict, and would avoid at all costs, that&#039;s the problem Imo, it&#039;s such a gradual decline to perdition, it&#039;s hardly noticeable. I found if you can use the heroin, and not let it use you. You have a fighting chance of maintaining a so called normal life, let it grip you by the neck and it will rag&nbsp; you senseless and take you&#039;re money,pride,health,looks,family,self esteem, the list&#039;s endless as you guys know. A methadone script helps, also Subutex UK and Subxenoe US, can help you try and lead a normal life. It doesn&#039;t male things any easier with the quality of the gear on here ;D

				The only substance I have been addicted to was nicotine.
