I could go directly to sleep and sleep though the night after only being awake for 8 hours off a full nights sleep. The effects are as follows:<br /><br />1. Smoke<br />2. Sweat intensely <br />3. Disoriented mild high<br />4. headache<br />5. Weakness<br />6. Sleep<br /><br />This is all in a 2 hour period and had the same effects every day when attempting to find a good shard. From what I can tell so far it is not meth. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have the equipment to confirm what it is made out of entirely before the time is up on the order. The crack back pattern, temp, effects the substance has and the melting temperature are why I can say without a doubt that it is for sure not Methamphetamine Hydrochloride.&nbsp; It appears to be some kind of Alkylbenzylamine. They are very close in melting temp so I need a controlled stable heat source to be more accurate.&nbsp; If I can confirm zero real product then I would lean towards this being N-isopropylbenzylamine.&nbsp; I would like to stress that it is possible that chaletla is not aware of this because of how close it is to the real deal. I will keep everyone informed on how this goes. <br /><br />I really hope this is not on purpose to newbies because that seems to be the pattern I see on this forum!

				Thanks for this. I placed an order of 1g from ChaletLA over 2 weeks ago and have been given the runaround stating the package was shipped late, but even 6 days in transit after he said it was shipped, here I sit with nothing. <br /><br />What&#039;s funny is that I have another account with over 40 transactions and well over 10k spent and not a single refund. This account happened to be one I created for a friend (with 3k spent and 3 transactions) and used since he owed me some btc and it was easier (so I thought). I fear that I will probably not get anything, or if I do it will be this kind of product that was mentioned above. Either way the resolution will go through in a couple days, but call it a lesson learned about dealing with ChaletLA. If they happen to provide a good product or something changes I will update, but so far I feel like I am being strung along.<br /><br />So far, I have been buying Tina from TheDopeSpot and I have been pretty happy with the gear and the ship times. I wanted to try someone else just to see what else was out there. I should have stuck with what was working, lol.
