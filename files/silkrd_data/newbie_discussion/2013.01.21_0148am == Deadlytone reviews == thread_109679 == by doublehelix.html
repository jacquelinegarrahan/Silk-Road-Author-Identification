				Hello, I&#039;m still counted as newb appearantly so here is only place I can post this<br /><br />what sort of experiences have any of you possibly had with this vendor, Deadlytone? He(or she or they) seems to have good feedback but there were no discussions here so I had to start this one. Thoughts?

				Any news about him. He seems to have great product for a fair price, but also demands FE for people outside of Sweden. Has anyone made any experience? Any kind of feedback woud be great,

				Look at how long they been vending and see how many transactions they have. Look at there latest feedback and see if they have a forum review thread listed on their page and if so you should be able to at least read it but not post yet until you get the 50 post count. It&#039;s against SR policy to FE and vendors are supposed to have at least 55 transaction before even asking buyers to FE. It&#039;s easier to scam you when you are new because you have not proven yourself as established buyers yet and no body will take your side so don&#039;t FE

				Yes, Mike, very good advice. Unfortunately, I did not read the forum prior to my order with this vendor. He told me that I had to finalize before he would ship. This being my first order, I did not know what a huge risk that was. I have been waiting nearly a month for my order and nothing yet. I have corresponded back and forth with him to no avail. I first tried to contact him after not receiving my order for two weeks. He did not respond, Then a few days later, I tried again. When I did not receive a response, I posted a comment and a 1/5 on his feedback which got his attention. He was very upset with the rating and called me an idiot and said that if I did not change his rating that he would not ship or refund my order. I offered to change the rating once I received my order and apologized for any misunderstanding. He has not replied. This lesson cost me just under 30 bitcoins. The bright side to this is that I was going to place a much larger order with him but decided to give it a trial run before buying more. Definitely glad I did. If you are going to deal with this vendor, I suggest not finalizing before receiving your shipment.
