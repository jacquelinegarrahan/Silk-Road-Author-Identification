				Placed an order for 2 tabs yesterday. Marked as in transit today. I will update once product arrives as well as after it is tested. <br /><br />On other note vendor was quick when asked a question about product,and has not asked me FE, and seems like a good guy. Again will update later!

				Glad to see a new L vendor from Canada, there is a flow of very good L around here these days. But honestly, as a new vendor, you should send off a few samples or put an interesting offer for low quantity so people can estimate quality and test the waters. Even on SR, there are a lot of L vendors. <br /><br />Your prices are alright, if it&#039;s really 100ug-110ug, but if it&#039;s less like 70-80ug, you can find way better deal. Pictures help too... I mean you&#039;re new and we don&#039;t even see a single picture of the product and you&#039;ve different prints. It sounds like it comes from different sources, it makes the dosage estimation a bit worthless since I don&#039;t think you have a different lab test from each print.<br /><br />Just a few tips... You can ignore me if you wish. Hope it helps as I&#039;m myself very interested, I felt it was necessary.<br /><br />Peace.

				Still waiting for gear. Vendor has been&nbsp; in contact and very fast in replying and keeping me up to date even though things have been rather delayed (going on a month now). I&#039;m still holding out hope that he will come though for me, although I will not lie I am a little upset about having gotten my hopes up that it would arrive on time twice now. Guess we will see when it finally arrives if it was wroth the wait. I will be updating.

				Yeah I could ask for a refund he did offer and to still send the gear for free. I told him I didn&#039;t mind paying as long as he corrected problems and such which he says he has. However it does seem his mail runs VERY slow which I&#039;m fine with as long as that is communicated but like I said I&#039;m going on a month now and I&#039;m a little concerned with product damage from all the &quot;shipping&quot; that has been going on. Any ways I&#039;ll update he pm&#039;ed me and explained what happened and that he would be reshipping with all problems corrected. We will see how long it takes to get here now that it is all &quot;corrected&quot;.

				I wish the best for you mate, and if you have decent acid that is decently priced, it is sure to sell out quickly.

				Has anyone received anything from this seller? I&#039;m tempted by the incredibly cheap mushrooms (willing to risk being scammed, for that price), but will be holding off until at least SOME reports come in. <br /><br />Was really hoping there&#039;d be a few people saying the vendor&#039;s legit. Oh well :(
