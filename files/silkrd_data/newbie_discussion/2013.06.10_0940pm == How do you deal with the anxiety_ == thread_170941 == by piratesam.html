				&nbsp;I want to know how first time users have dealt with their anxiety when taking for the first time. I myself have pretty bad anxiety and have the mental reaction that &quot;Anything synthetic&quot; is going to kill me. For christs sake I took a diet sup today with all natural ingredients but sense it had so much caffeine I got a little jittery and flipped shit. I&#039;m not looking for hardcore narcotics, just you&#039;re all natural shit &quot;Pretty much anything that isn&#039;t made in a lab or with a bunch of bad shit like cocaine. How do you first time users of a drug deal with the anxiety?

				Well a lot of natural drugs are good, and cocaine isn&#039;t synthetic, it&#039;s just extracted from coca. Synthetic doesn&#039;t mean unnatural! I personally don&#039;t have any anxiety when trying new drugs, just excitement :) You can still do opium if you&#039;re afraid of using refined or synthetic stuff, and a lot of psychedelics are natural so you don&#039;t really need to only take pure stuff.

				I got out of drugs years ago, but there is pretty much nothing on the list that was not used :)<br /><br />if the anxy shit is really bad, pop a few valium, xanax whatever and you will soon be feeling chilled again.

				Benzos are fine when used in moderation. They&#039;re incredibly safe if taken by themselves (pretty much impossible to OD). Do NOT get addicted. The WD are worse than pretty much any other drug and can even kill your ass. <br /><br />Stay safe!

				Shrooms is my suggestion :D<br /><br />I don&#039;t distinguish between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; (arsenic is natural bro!)<br /><br />That said, shrooms is probably one of the safest drugs you can find and it&#039;s au naturale. <br /><br />

				If that&#039;s your preference then probably weed is your best bet. I suggested shrooms earlier, but if it&#039;s a huge issue, I would not recommend shrooms with anxiety problems. I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, and I think that it&#039;s actually helped me better understand how to deal with stress, but it may not be something good for you. Try the weed.

				With anxiety like you are describing, maybe you shouldn&#039;t do drugs.&nbsp; You probably wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; enjoy it anyway :(<br />Glad I am not you :D<br />I also have anxiety, I take Xanax, but doing drugs (coke, heroin, and weed) every once in awhile, makes me feel great ;D<br />Remember, everything in moderation ;D<br /><br />Good luck

Counterintuitive, since it&#039;s much more synthetic than coke, but it&#039;d probably help. <br /><br />I used to be nervous about synthetics too, especially lsd and the likes. then I said fuck it and everything changed. but seriously, don&#039;t try anything you aren&#039;t ready for! And always start small. you can&#039;t un-take something, but you can always increase doseage
