				Hi at all,<br />i&#039;ve risked a perquisition buy police yesterday at home, fortunally all gone well. I knew before that they would to come at home so i dropped my synthetic cannabinoids in the toilet but now i read in some articles that dogs can&#039;t detect them.<br /><br />Is that true? <br />In this case ship smoking blends is very very simple!<br /><br />Thank you all for future answers

If you are so well-known to your local LE that you are being fucking raided, and then you STILL go ahead and order ANYTHING from SR you are a mo&#039;ron and deserve time inside to learn some fucking sense.<br /><br />The second part is are synths detectable by dogs?<br /><br />The short answer is, yes they are: if the dog has been trained to detect them, and the they are not sealed properly. <br />Dogs are usually trained to sniff out anything that LE have found in prior raids. Training can be and is often ongoing as new chems are found, it&#039;s not just a once off thing. LE often &#039;plant&#039; drugs at places like airport lost-luggage rooms and so forth,&nbsp; behind the scenes,&nbsp; just to keep the dogs limber, and reinforce their learning, which sounds like something you could do with brother.<br /><br />Having said that, LE are real busy everywhere looking for million dollar hauls, they don&#039;t piss about with newbies letters, unless, like you claim to be, the newbie is a well-known user. <br />In that case bro, move interstate, or prepare to bend over, a lot, in the next couple years.

				Ok but i think that if police want to to raid me probably they don&#039;t know what to looking for. In my country smart drugs (like spices) are new kinds of drugs and only recently the law moves.<br />So i think that is unlikely that a random dog can detect a fucking blend!
