				Hi, I want to share my (very positive) experiences with SR from last week :)<br /><br />So after few weeks of just looking around on SR and forums also on clearnet, I decided to order something and test it. I always wanted to try MDMA or LSD (I have experience with lot of another psychedelics, hallucinogens) but it&#039;s really difficult to get it here in Slovakia. But instead of getting LSD I decided to try Tyl3r Durden&#039;s 25i NBOMe first after reading lot of great reviews and feedback and also I was afraid to invest more money for the first time. Also I decided to order MDMA from jesusofrave mostly because he sells something like testing package, different batches - one gram of each. That was good for me as I am first time user.<br /><br />MDMA arrived in 2 days from UK to Slovakia! NBOMe in 3 days also from UK and I got 42 blotters instead of 25! so after few days of stress, everything went better than expected :)<br /><br />Everything was split between me and my friend and I forgot there are two different batches of MDMA, my friend took it so I didn&#039;t even see the another batch. My gram was completely crushed white powder... like flour. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s good or bad, but on pictures MDMA almost always looks like brownish rocks.<br /><br />So with another friend we decided to test it. I am male, 21 years, 75 kg and my friend is female, 21y, 55 kg. She is also first time user. I split the whole gram to equal 10 doses (I have read that usual dose is 0.1 g). We both ate our 1 dose and flushed it with water. It was bitter but not extremely like I have read. Just normal bitter taste.<br /><br />After 30 mins we both started to feel nice body buzz. Something like on weed+alcohol but better. So we were sitting quiet maybe 5 minutes and just enjoying this feeling and sometimes we looked to each other and smiled and we knew it&#039;s working :)&nbsp; Also we had slowed reactions and decided to go outside for a walk. Walking and moving in general was very comfortable, we were happy, talking much... I wasn&#039;t even able to tell everything I wanted to. Everything seemed like a good idea so we went to many places just to go there and look at it (like buildings or bars we have never been to). We were very smiley, happy, peaceful, just feeling good. While walking, body buzz was not so strong, but when we sit somewhere body buzz increased instantly and instead of talking I started to enjoy it quietly.<br /><br />The effects started to calm down after about 2 and a half hours and we were feeling tired (it was evening, I was the whole day in school and she was in work). We took another bit (about 50 mg each) and the effects lasted another 2 hours. All the time we had psychical energy to &quot;do things&quot; BUT no physical energy. In the end we smoked little bit of weed before sleep, she went home, I went home. I had no problem to feel asleep. <br /><br />I also plan to try those 25i NBOMe 1200 ug tabs.<br />I can post photo of both items.
