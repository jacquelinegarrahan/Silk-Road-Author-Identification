				I&#039;m going to be in London for a psytrance warehouse rave and I&#039;d really like to dose LSD there, but since I&#039;ll be on my own and in a new environment, it could go very badly if I overdo it. I&#039;ve taken 1200ug of 25i before, 20mg of 2c-b and 2.4g of dried cubensis shrooms (all seperately) and I&#039;ve handled them all with no problems. I was thinking somewhere between 100 and 200ug would be good - either taking one or one and a half tabs of Fartbomber&#039;s ~117ug acid.<br /><br />Now, overdoing it would be an issue (only because of the possibility of having a bad trip, I&#039;m not expecting to be able to drop acid and keep my wits about me!), but - by the same token -<br />&nbsp;I will not be happy if I end up bored for 12 hours until I can get home because I didn&#039;t dose high enough.<br /><br />Thoughts? I may have 20mg 2c-b and some weed with me, for if the acid alone isn&#039;t enough after a few hours.

				I&#039;d rather dose low, enjoy it and have a backup if necessary. Rather than freak out and ruin the whole thing.<br />

				i took acid at a festival and it was intense as fuck i went and hallucinated some mad shit in my tent because my legs didn&#039;t want to hold me. wouldn&#039;t recommend doing it for the first time at a rave. i&#039;ve never had the urge to dance while tripping either but music is amazing. 2cb might be a better option.

				Years ago a group of friends all went to outdoor concert camping and took 3 hits of acid each. I have no idea on strength but they all came from the same sheet - gooney bird lol. Five of us were having a great time interacting with fellow concert goers but one was not. He refused to leave the tent and totally freaked. Heavy hallucinations that made no sense to the trip we were on. Better too little than too much imo and try it in a controlled safe setting first. Good luck and have fun.

				I agree with you all about the concept of dosing &#039;low&#039;, but what would class as a low dose?

				around 100ug maybe. they&#039;re rarely accurate on dosage so it&#039;s hard to tell til you&#039;re in another world

				I actually had a very similar first experience to the future plans you are describing... dropped 2 fire doses and went to a rave. It was a LOT of fun - great OEVs, but not very introspective to be honest (as is understandable given the set/setting).

				Ideally you would want to try it by itself in a safe setting first.. but consider candy flipping to avoid any anxiety you might have!

				Okay, thanks for the help guys! I think I&#039;ll dose one tab, then maybe the another half about an hour later if I feel I can handle it (I know I probably won&#039;t be peaking at this point, but if I leave it any longer, won&#039;t tolerance set in?), then I can try to find some MDMA there for after the peak.

				Just take the 2 avatars at same time before you leave your house and go into&nbsp; the adventure !<br />Dont bother looking for&nbsp; MDMA .<br />Have the 2cb with you for later dosing wen on the party at around 5 hours after taking the tabs!<br />And have another tab for wen the 2cb wears off(or2)<br /><br />
