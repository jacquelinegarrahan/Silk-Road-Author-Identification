				I&#039;m wanting to buy some MDMA but I&#039;m not familiar with how much 1 gram really is. Google has failed me somehow. I normally buy 1 &quot;pure molly&quot; for $15, there is a very small amount in the capsule and I never knew how much it was. So how many capsules can I make from 1 gram?<br /><br />I understand that you want to take 100-150mg to feel good. I normally get body highs from 2 capsules, 3 if I want to feel amazing. There is 1000mg in 1 gram, so could I make 10 capsules from 1 gram? I find that hard to believe if 1 gram is selling for $75, that is really cheap...<br /><br />Please help :(

				Where I&#039;m from MDMA goes for $90 a gram if you don&#039;t know your dealer. <br /><br />A hit I think would be near 60mg so you can do 2 without doing too much, and a third if you want to really feel good. That&#039;s just how I roll though ;)<br /><br />EDIT: My friend puts 150mg in his capsules, so he can open it up and make a line or two, and ingest the rest. Gives him a better peak so he says. You could split 1g into 7 capsules for just under 150mg each

				You already have your answer.&nbsp; A good hit is around 100-150 mg.&nbsp; I see grams going for a lot cheaper than $75.&nbsp; That&#039;s just the market price on SR.&nbsp; Nothing to worry about.

				One gram mdma, @ 100mg caps = 10 pills. <br /><br />You shouldnt make the the caps more than 100mg per, to be safe when giving them to people, if they are heavy then they can take two or three.. <br /><br />The approximate dose is 1.5mg per LB of body weight.

				I&#039;m sure he meant 1.5-2mg/kg which is what I was told.<br /><br />For me (I weigh 63.5kg) this means 95-127mg which is perfect(Difference between 120mg and 200mg wasn&#039;t worth the 80mg, my jaw hurt A LOT, I sweat A LOT, and I had a bit of a comedown.)<br /><br />EDIT: I buy my capsules at the local drug store. Bought a PALMSCALE 7 for $60 online.<br /><br />And which vendors are you guys getting your MDMA from? I&#039;m paying ~$30 a gram here.. If I dealt I&#039;d be making almost 60 dollars per gram!

It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some of those bong/drug tool stores sell them as well. For filling them, buy a $10 digital scale off of Amazon, or cut a gram into 10 piles if you&#039;re a slacker, and go from there. <br /><br />As for dosage, it really depends on quality. All of the local mdma I&#039;ve seen or know of other people taking local mdma, is mostly crap. That&#039;s why most everyone I know doesn&#039;t touch powder/crystals, but when they try the SR stuff they fiend for me. The good vendor stuff from SR has me tanked any where above 200mg in a single dose and I usually dose people at 120mg and an 80mg for a single night of partying. They love it.

				Hi<br /><br />You will get 5 x 200mg very serious rolls from a gram, the best pressed pills are 200mg BUT I really wouldn&#039;t advise ingesting 200mg at one time.<br /><br />My girl and I do MDMA every few months, so we are not hardened to it, but can happily do 200mg if we space it in a couple of drops. Great times, no harm done, best of rolls, but that is 100 here and 100 an hour or two later.<br /><br />God, don&#039;t even like to think of the discomfort of 200 coming up on ya in one go, but that is the dosage we like if spaced out a little.<br /><br />Have a good time, take care.

				In 1995 at the start of my love affair, a &quot;PT&quot; single dose was a measured 120mg. That was enough for the night. At the beginning, try not to overdo it. You&#039;ll fry yourself and you&#039;ll have to increase the needed dosage too soon to keep it going long term. Warriors dance at Milton Keynes, nearly twenty years later, I pushed down nigh on a gram of 80% over four hours.&nbsp; Erm... lets just say I was a little pickled! If it was a gram, I&#039;d go with ten caps. Its easy to remember what you&#039;ve got, what you&#039;ve had and you can keep the dosage to a controlled level. And if people are new to it 100mg&#039;s is a sensible start.

				When I cap MDMA for friends i use #4 Capsules and fill them all the way.&nbsp; It&#039;s about 130-150 mg.&nbsp; I usually charge $15 per pill.&nbsp; Most Pressed E Pills in the US are ~85mg.&nbsp; An Optimal dose of MDMA per A. Shulgin&nbsp; is 160mg for an average weight person.
