				I checked the forums for another place to create this thread, but. I could not, so.....Yeah, I have not been able to log into the SR for the past half hour of trying. I even created a new id to try. That being said, I am running liberte linux through my flash drive. Anyone with the similar set up having a similar issue with logging into the road? <br /><br />Lol, finally got btc and I can&#039;t log into my site so that I can deposit them from where I have them. lmao. fuckers

				Hi, oftentimes some things get overloaded, could be Tor, could be SR, could be an issue with the Internet somewhere. So yeah, I have had issues like that.&nbsp; Also, I have found Liberte to be SLOWER than other connection options.&nbsp; If you ever want to try something new, try TAILs linux.&nbsp; You load it on a CD or flash drive like liberte but I find it to be much faster in connecting to web pages.&nbsp; Another tip to speed up SR is to go into your profile settings and turn on &quot;incognito mode&quot;.&nbsp; This will make it so that none of the product pictures load which actually speeds up browsing around.&nbsp; I go in and turn it back off if I want to see the pictures again.<br /><br />Another tip is to use the Tor control panel to &quot;Get a New Identity&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where in Liberte that is but in all other places, you can right-click the onion symbol and click it.&nbsp; This may get you going again.<br /><br />blahblah1234

				I just tested a login to SR and was able to get in OK.&nbsp; Keep trying!<br /><br />And here is the link for Tails linux.&nbsp; Read up on it in your spare time, I ditched liberte because liberte was SO SLOW....&nbsp; Tails is anonymous, secure, Torified, etc, similar to Liberte.<br /><br />Clearnet warning - http://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />blahblah1234<br />

				Thanks. I am not sure the issue. I do not think I&#039;ll try tails, I have read up on it. I am getting used to using this now. I do not mind the loading, I couldn&#039;t login. I just made a new ID. <br /><br />I appreciate your imput chief. Thanks again.

				Hey blah! Or anyone else reads this. I remember reading last night that there has been issues with taking some time for your deposits to get deposited to sr account. Just curious, I sent them from blockchain to sr. What is a good approximation as far as that transaction being complete? <br /><br />And I went. bitinstant+walmart+mtgox+offline wallet+blockchain+sr. I think what took the longest was the drive to my local walmart. The coins where in mtgox when I got home. took 5 mins to transfer from there. took less than that from there to offline and even less to blockchain. Just for anyone unsure of who to use for your btc. that was super efficient even had a decent conversation with the young kid at the walmart. lol
