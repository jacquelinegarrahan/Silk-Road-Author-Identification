				i&#039;ve always broken my BTH down into monkey juice and cut it with some hydroxyzine to sniff (highly recommended) or just chased it off foil (tried and true) in the past, but i was looking at this fat glob of boy i&#039;ve got and doing some dabs at the same time when it occurred to me:&nbsp; why couldn&#039;t i just dab my bth like i do with errl??&nbsp; i have a spare TI skillet to try it out on, but i have an EXTREMELY low opiate tolerance (re: none) and even though this is just some decent local, the bubbler i&#039;d be using has a honeycomb perc that turns vapor into air pretty much, and there&#039;s been multiple times when friends are over that they take such huge hits without even realizing it that they pass into an extended oil nap after like 30 min.&nbsp; basically, i want to try this, and i&#039;m not worried about ODing or any shit like that, i just love to nod and hate to puke so i&#039;d really like to avoid getting way more wrecked than i intended to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />another thought; should i take the water out of the bubbler??&nbsp; would it make more sense just to heat up the skillet, smear it on there and catch the smoke with my glass straw??&nbsp; idk, lots of questions, and i would really hate to waste this shit doing something silly like burning it all up and destroying the goods cuz the skillets too hot or w/e. <br /><br />what do yall think SR??&nbsp; has anyone ever tried this or used a similar method??

				so i went ahead and just gave it a go..&nbsp; i made sure to dump the water out of my piece seeing as heroin is very water soluble and after dabbing 2 dots that would normally get me buzzed off foil i am FUCKED off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is the best most efficient way to smoke boy i&#039;ve ever tried, and i actually caught a little rush..&nbsp; love it maneeeeee&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if u have a oil rig and you like BTH then do not hesitate, i&#039;ll prolly make a G last 2 weeks doing this.. (reminder: i have zero opiate tolerance, altho i have swallowed snorted or smoked just about every kind there is)<br /><br />goin back 4 more before this nod is too hard 4 moke&nbsp; 8) 8) 8) 8) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
