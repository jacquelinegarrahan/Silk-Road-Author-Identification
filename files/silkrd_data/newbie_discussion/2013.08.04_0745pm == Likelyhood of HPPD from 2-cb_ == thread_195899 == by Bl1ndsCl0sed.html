				Hey everyone,<br /><br />This should be in drug safety, but I dont have my 50 posts yet.&nbsp; If I can&#039;t get a good answer here, maybe ill spam to 50 to post this question there.<br /><br />Anyways, I recently ordered and recieved some 2-cb (from Capsule Corp, great transaction!) - But now I&#039;m reading about / freaking myself out about the potential of developing HPPD.<br /><br />Believe me when I say I&#039;m a relatively light drug user.&nbsp; I wont use psychedelic&#039;s more than 2-3 times a year, and it&#039;s been about 2 years since I&#039;ve tripped on anything.&nbsp; I used MDMA for the first time about a month ago, and that was Awesome.<br /><br />In my life I&#039;ve used LSD (moderate to heavy doses) - about 5 or 6 times.&nbsp; Mushroomss (moderate to heavy) about 5-6 times as well.&nbsp; Never had any issues with HPPD, nor did I even know it existed.<br /><br />So now, I&#039;m aware of it&#039;s existence, which I know can&#039;t help my cause (you know, if you fear / think about a symptom, you&#039;ll cause it to happen) - I wish I never saw the letters &#039;HPPD&#039; !&nbsp; I only plan on doing 2cb several times, And I still intend to do just that, but I&#039;m just looking for some reassurance that HPPD is more likely in individuals who use drugs / phsychedelics more heavily and with greater frequency.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m 85% sure that everything will be fine, just looking for a little insight for that other 15%&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Any insight is greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!

				if you&#039;ve already done lsd and shrooms you&#039;ll likely be okay. HPPD usually happens the first few times you use psychedelics, although sometimes it can happen to more experienced users. but it&#039;s usually the first few times since people are predisposed to HPPD.

				I&#039;m fairly certain that the 2Cs in general are notorious for causing HPPD, or at least HPPD-like symptoms.

				I&#039;ve taken 2cb a number of times and not had an issue like this.&nbsp; It&#039;s effects never seem to linger for me. I&#039;ve not heard of others having any problem either. My guess is that you will be fine, but it also seems like something that could put you in a negative space if you&#039;re worried about it.<br /><br />I once ingested a very large dose of LSD. The after effects of that trip lasted days. While it was a profound experience, it definitely taught me respect for that molecule.
