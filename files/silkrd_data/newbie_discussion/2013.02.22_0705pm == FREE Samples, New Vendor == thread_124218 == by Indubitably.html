				I don&#039;t have enough money for your free samples unfortunately. <br /><br />BTW - 150mg of MDMA for the price you are charging for postage costs more than buying a strong pill (probably more molly, stated on listing as ~200mg and from what I&#039;ve heard that&#039;s about right) including postage, at the regular prices from the people who sell pills from Holland. You shouldn&#039;t really even be listing it as a free sample IMHO. If it was a genuine free sample you would list it either with free postage to US customers or with free postage worldwide. If something costs money, it isn&#039;t free. My gut feeling is that for your US customers, at that price you&#039;re probably still making a profit with your free sample. Maybe not making a profit sending worldwide though. I don&#039;t mean to sound like a tool or offend you, just saying how it looks to me.<br /><br />Best of luck&nbsp; :)

Read, read, read...then start vending.<br /><br />Good luck with your business, though.

				Hello everyone, <br /><br />I see that a lot of people are having issues with paying for their own shipping. Well, not a lot of people (I have had over 50 requests and orders placed since I put the samples offer out) but I can see that it is an issue for some. I can offer up a solution for you all to consider. I will offer a shipping costs refund to the first 50 people who requests after they have left a review of the product on my vendor page. The reason that I will not simply cut the shipping costs out is because of the warnings that I have received prior to setting up my vendor page about the downfalls to offering samples. Mainly the fact that a lot of people will requests the samples and not give anything remotely close to a review of it or ever even seriously considered placing an order. <br />I hope that this is an acceptable solution.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m not willing to try samples from the US, <br />but I just wanted to lett you know that there&#039;s a list of &quot;reliable reviewers&quot;. <br />The people on that list do know what they&#039;re doing. <br /><br />If you want to find someone from that list to sample your product you can check my &quot;signature&quot; and then look for someone from the States. <br /><br />Good luck to you!

				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />I know that I have an abundance of dissatisfied customers and I am posting here right now to let you all know that I am and have been taking care of the horrendous shipping dilemmas that I have been having. I have been trying to communicate with a number of you all through SR but have been getting the &quot;Problem loading page&quot; message more consistently than I have been getting an actual website page. So if I have not been in touch with you for a while this is the reason. I also have been busy refunding monies to various members. For those of you who wish refunds in a manner in which it will not hurt your profile, please send me a message. I do not wish to set anyone back because of my mistakes which were based on my lack of experience here on SR. The overall experience that I have had with SR for the first 12 days has been, let me say... overwhelming. I see that I am going to need to hire more personnel than I currently have, but I cannot complain about the learning curve that I have gone through. :-)<br /><br />I apologize to any and everyone who my inexperience has frustrated.
