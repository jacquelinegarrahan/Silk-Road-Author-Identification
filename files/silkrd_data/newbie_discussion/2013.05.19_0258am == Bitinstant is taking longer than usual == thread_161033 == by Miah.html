				Just wanted to let anyone that has a transaction pending or plans on using Bitinstant you&#039;ll get your bitcoins. When I ordered it didn&#039;t come through on the blockchain at all for several hours and after contacting them and what not the coins did finally show up at my address. It did take around 20 hours so there&#039;s a bit of a wait. <br /><br />Just a heads up!

				I had the same thing happen with one of my first deposits. I deposited late on a Saturday night and it took until Sunday morning for the deposit to hit my wallet. Other than that, every other deposit has gone through in a matter of minutes. I hope that streak continues.
