				How do y&#039;all store acid? and why do you do it that way? I&#039;ve always kept mine in the freeze wrapped in foil and sealed in a zip-lock or three, but I&#039;ve heard condensation can be a problem. Last time I tripped, taking one of Fatburger&#039;s 100ug WoW tabs, I think this may have contributed to a less potent product. <br />In that same vein, I&#039;ve always wondered about shipping acid. How much degrades in transit? Since so many dealers ship their Lucy international, does it become a problem when tabs are in the mail for up to 3 or 4 weeks? <br />Finally handling acid. I&#039;m not talking about large amounts of liquid or crystal, either. I know the handling procedures are &quot;be careful as fuck if you don&#039;t want to to fry.&quot; But I&#039;ve heard people talk about absorbing though your skin (though I&#039;m almost positive this isn&#039;t an issue), or worse, degrading it though moisture on your hands or the oil on your skin? <br />Thoughts?

				Not answering your question, but how much experience with LSD do you have? I&#039;ve taken it maybe 5 times but never a verified dosage and I was wondering about the quality of FatBurger&#039;s acid. I took two tabs of his wow on one occasion and one tab on another and I don&#039;t think it was a full 100 mics but I don&#039;t have the experience to say.&nbsp; It was a nice and clean though.

Most of my tripping was on mushrooms when I was dealing. Honestly my experience lead me to the same conclusion as you. I wasn&#039;t sure though, because I moved mine a lot and had it stored in a lunchbox full of icepacks for as long as eighteen hours on one train ride. I also didn&#039;t allow the tabs to reach room temperature when I removed them from the plastic bag, which is apparently when the aforementioned condensation problem is supposed to become as issue. But yep, clean though fairly weak compared to the advertised strength. I&#039;ve never actually taken tested acid, and I&#039;m pretty sure on at least one occasion I took a RC sold as cid. <br />How long did you trip for? Did you get visuals? Euphoria? Distorted thinking?&nbsp;

				LSD is very stable when on blotter paper or solid crystal form, less so when in liquid solution, and more susceptible to degradation as such. Acid will keep and retain most of its potency, for a very long time if stored properly. Avoid heat, light, air, and moisture. No particular container is necessary, I avoid foil due to its heat conductibility and the freezer isnt really a requisite, but plastic bags and an opaque container/layer are just fine as long as it is in a reasonably cool storage area.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Dip, any insight into the the condensation thing. And what about touching tabs with bare skin? I&#039;m not overly worried about both, but I figure for how amazing Lucy is, might as well treat her the best I can.

				The trips lasted about as long as they should have- was on my way down after 6 or so hours. Visuals were never very strong but definitely present...unfortunate because sometimes a breakout psychedelic experience is closer than you&#039;d guess. I smoked some good bud in the middle of my trip on the one tab and things got quite warped pretty quickly but it only lasted a very short while. Decent euphoria and feeling of well being both times. Didn&#039;t really make me very introspective though and I felt like, in a way, my mind wasn&#039;t as powerful as it is on mushrooms (lots of experience with mushrooms as well).

I&#039;d say let&#039;s trip together sometime, but then there goes our anonymity. My trip was closer to ten hours, but definitely wearing off around 6. The other thing that was different was the fact that my friend and I had to take a train up the coast early the next morning, and a series of urgent problems regarding that trip consumed the latter half of our trip. It was never unpleasant (actually that when the unstoppable laughter really kicked in) but trying to accomplish a lists of tasks on a deadline, some of which required biking at night with no light in a very unfriendly town for cyclists, showed me exactly how fucked up we were. All in all a fun trip, even if it was on the lighter side.
