				A couple weeks ago I came upon a listing for a 5-strip of &quot;Lady in the Sea&quot; LSD blotters from OrderOfThePhoenix so I ordered a strip and last night I decided to give them a test run. Upon careful consideration and meditation through out the day I had decided to take 2 blotters, listed at 100micrograms each. Took sub-lingual about 5:30pm with some cannabis about a half hour in.<br /><br />About an hour in really started to notice the effects setting in. It was almost as if I had a super-drunk feeling yet I still had full control of my body and speech. I decide to take an evening stroll around the neighborhood and enjoy the scenery listening to some music. <br /><br />The peak was intense but not too overwhelming. This lasted a good 3+ hours. Then as nightfall set in my trip started to take on a very insightful tone. I laid on the trampoline in the back yard and watch the stars do their thing for a while. <br /><br />This was by far the cleanest LSD that I have ever had. No jaw clenching, no random headaches that come and go and no intense muscle cramping.<br /><br />About 2am I had decided that the ride must end and took 10mg of Valium, this brought me down like landing on a big puffy cloud. Woke up this morning after about 6 hours sleeping and felt AWESOME!<br /><br />Just wanted to put my 2 cents in and see if anyone else had any experiences to share?

				Yes, I also got the 5x of the Lady in the sea and was very impressed with the quality. Just recieved 10x of WoW from him that I&#039;m going to dose tomoro and about to place an order for 25x of the same WoW. <br /><br />All around good acid, good vendor.

				I&#039;ve never had those specific blotters, but I can say that I&#039;ve never had a peaceful LSD experience. I&#039;m quite jealous of you. Although (for me at least) anti-psychotics (seroquel, risperodone, etc.) are far superior to benzos for going to sleep. No only do they make you tired, but they actually antagonize your serotonin receptors, essentially attenuating the effects of LSD entirely. I had a really bad trip once on 5 hits of decently potent acid (vomiting, paranoia, the whole nine yards), but once I took 50mg of seroquel (smallest dosage they manufacture) the trip was completely gone within 30 minutes and I slept like a baby. I felt so stupid for forgetting that I had some stashed away.
