				Coming from a fairly new user of SR i used bitinstant and mtgox to fund my account, besides the bullshit process of verification (i got lucky it only took a few hours, people have reported weeks with no response) it was the easiest and most anonymous way IMO. Recently they took the site down so i know all of u went on a crazy hunt looking for a new way to fund ur SR account. Well look no further. Localbitcoins.com is the shit! I dont want this to sound like an advertisement or something but it seriously came through in the clutch for me i had to tell fellow noobs. it was easy as hell i used western union but theres a variety of options to choose for payment. its almost instant and the thing that pulled me in was they had an escrow system. u communicate directly with the seller of the bitcoins so theres no mix up. it has a rating system and feedback for the sellers similiar to SR. My seller actually walked me through the shit and i was sketched out the whole time i know i was a pain. well thanks for listening hope i help some people out. <br /><br /><br /><br />O YEA THIS IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO PAY CASH AND GET THERE BTCS, NOT LINK AN ACCOUNT OR ANY OF THAT OTHER NON SENSE.

				they done have to be around u...i bought mine from someone in oregon. u just have to click on cash deposits and it brings up everyone that accepts that payment. u can buy from someone in china as long as u can deposit into there bank or western union, moneygram etc. i didnt even have to walk 2 mins from my house. truely the easiest
