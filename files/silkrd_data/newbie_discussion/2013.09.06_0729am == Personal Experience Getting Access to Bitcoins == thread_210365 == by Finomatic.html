				From my personal experience I can (so far) highly recommend Bitstamp (www.bitstamp.net). SEPA transfers got credited within one day and the transferring out of Bitcoins worked fast and effienctly. Ease-to-use interface. Initially, only e-mail authorization required (trades need to be confirmed by e-mail), up to USD 1.000 as I understand. Thereafter, ID etc required. Hopy they stay in business.

				A friend of mine also uses bitstamp, he is also pleased with it.<br />That said, linking your bitcoin address to your real identity with a SEPA transfer (and I believe bitstamp requires additional ID), is a potential security risks and bitcoin transactions can be traced and statistical analysis could be used to identify SR transactions (there are some papers about this).<br /><br />if you want to buy bitcoins anonymously , (CLEARNET WARNING) localbitcoins.com is an option.<br />

				I went with Coinbase personally. I recall not going with Bitstamp because it was a hassle for American customers. Since I&#039;m not a SEPA customer the minimum transfer fee to Bitstamp is 15 dollars, which is just nuts if you&#039;re only trying to transfer a smaller amount. Coinbase&#039;s transfer fee was quite modest by comparison. Bitstamp may have had a better rate for larger transactions than Coinbase though.

				I&#039;ve been using Coinbase but I hate it cause I can&#039;t get verified which has happened on every site I came across due to a lot of moving around and I think not paying taxes, not owning a home and not having credit might also have something to do with it.
