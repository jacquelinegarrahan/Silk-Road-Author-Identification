				I&#039;m planning on taking my first tab of LSD sometime tomorrow - 110ug to stay on the mild side. I don&#039;t have any experience with drugs, but I figured LSD would be good to start with given its low toxicity and dependence liability. The psychedelic effects sound pretty insane and I really want to make sure my first trip is as good as it can be. Do you guys have any advice for a first time tripper willing to experiment? Cheers.

				my first time ,Id do ecstacy instead, but your choice ..... when you get off the porch you can troll / ax ...... troll = trip then roll / ax = acid then x ...... must take the acid first to do it right, but if your jus doing acid alone , drink lots of OJ during ur trip to enhance it

				Start with MDMA or magic mushrooms if i were you but then again im sure in the right surroundings your first trip will be beautiful. DOnt let other people worry you with horror stories, its not always as crazy as its made about to be. Sit back have a good time and enjoy.

				Just take it easy, flow with it and dont let it get to you. Take it on an empty stomach, i tried LSD for the first time and i took 1 tab about an hour after eating... and two hours after i wasn&#039;t feeling anything and took another... 2 hours after that i had mad visuals jajaja and great relaxation and empty mind. Great sense of inner peace. Lasted a good 8 hours.

It&#039;ll give you a nice background buzz and perhaps take some fear of the cid away.<br /><br />My advice for a proper trip, for a psychedelic experience, is to take a much larger dose. Maybe not your first time, just don&#039;t expect the REVELATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE or fucked-up visuals on a low dose. Slightly brighter colours and a &quot;mmm, something is happening&quot; feeling perhaps.<br />

				Make sure you have these things in your vicinity before you take your trip:<br /><br />1. Good friends that you trust. Don&#039;t do your trip - especially your first - alone. Have someone with you who you can rely on to be by your side if you feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />2. Comfortable surroundings where you won&#039;t be disturbed, but somewhere you can leave and go outside and also feel comfortable. Don&#039;t do your first acid in public.<br /><br />3. Have nice drinks and fresh fruit at hand.<br /><br />4. Have some good tunes, something to really listen to - nothing too hard or harsh.<br /><br />5. HAVE FUN!!<br />

				As mentioned above: <br />Choose the people you will be around carefully, peeps you fell completely confortable with and trust. <br />Choose a good peacefull &amp; confortable location where you can go outside.<br /><br />Have some weed to smoke during the trip.

				Agree with ^ and ^^ and so on.<br />Best advice, be with good, trustworthy friends.<br />Have lots of music and if you smoke have LOTS of cigarettes. <br />Try to clean out your system for a day or so beforehand, no fast food or other possible toxic intake.<br />Be able to go outside, but DO NOT GET IN A CAR IF THE DRIVER IS TRIPPING!<br />Definitely have some weed, don&#039;t drink alcohol.<br />If you can go swimming, do it. It is awesome!<br />Relax and go with the flow, speak up if you get uncomfortable, don&#039;t wait b/c you&#039;re worried what others may think.<br />I hope you have a wonderful time!

				Since the tab is 110ug you maybe feel nothing so tremendous different. Maybe a positive &quot;energy&quot; if I might say.<br /><br />Don&#039;t expect that the substance will kick in before 30-90 minutes. I always had this feeling at my first tries that the lsd didn&#039;t work. For the first hour don&#039;t do anything different than usual until you feel it. And with such a dose don&#039;t expect to have visuals. Especially like seeing dragons and elves as some say who has never tried. Lsd is NOT about visuals.<br /><br />When you start feeling it (again it is only 110ug so it will be a light experience) I will first advice some things NOT to do.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be nervous. If you feel nervous then don&#039;t do it all. <br />Lsd lasts for hours, so try and do it when you know that you have all day free.<br />Don&#039;t do it late at night. Try to take it as early as possible so you can enjoy the day.<br />Don&#039;t stay in front of a screen except if you are into writing. <br />Don&#039;t spend your &quot;quality&quot; time entertaining yourself with tv, video games. It might be fun but there are better things to do.<br /><br />Now advices.<br /><br />Music is one of the most addictive things you can do while on lsd. At least from my own personal experience.<br />If you play any kind of musical instruments then definitely spend some time there. It will be an new musical &quot;research&quot; not matter how experienced or not you are in music.<br /><br />Nature is by far the best place to be while on lsd. Try avoiding staying inside. Even if it rains :)<br />Swimming as one above me suggested, is an amazing feeling as well.<br /><br />There will be also a lot of thinking during these hours. Try to spend your thoughts in nice matters and not so much in personal problems. <br /><br />Lsd will definitely give you some physical energy. I tend to make looong walks in the forests or the city and just &quot;connect&quot; with the nature or socializing. I have found myself many times as well to clean the house and perfecting every detail. I don&#039;t do this, only on lsd :P<br /><br />Food.. Food is a tricky part at least for me. Either I &quot;forget&quot; to eat or when I am hungry I prepare some special dishes. Although -at least again for me- when I prepare for example something hot or with meat, when I start eating it I don&#039;t like it. I have noticed that I can only and really enjoy eating fruits and vegetables/salads. I guess while on lsd my body wants only natural raw things... Don&#039;t know..<br />Another thing about food. If you are going to take the blotter do it after 1-2 hours you have eaten a good meal/breakfast. Don&#039;t do it with empty stomach and don&#039;t do it immediately after eating. It will take longer time to kick in.<br /><br />No matter in what situation you are, being amongst friends is a good idea. If they could have lsd as well even better. <br /><br />You mentioned that you don&#039;t do other substances. But just for future advices if you get involved with others here is my advices.<br />If you have weed, well this is your call. A spliff is always good :)<br />There are many combos you can do, but my favorite is to take dmt while you are on lsd. Although when I take lsd or generally anything I tend to stick only to one substance. Expect lsd-dmt. This is great.<br /><br />If you like the experience you had then here comes another advice for future tries.<br /><br />Don&#039;t do it often. Lsd builds a tolerance that last days or weeks. Once per month maximum if you want to really feel it everytime. <br />Don&#039;t be afraid to raise the dose or even double it. <br />And last thing that I am trying to do when I plan my lsd day is to write down something I want to do or think while tripping. <br /><br />That&#039;s all I have to say for now. Just don&#039;t worry, lsd is one of the safest substances. <br /><br />Take care my friend, enjoy your experience and if you really like the moment don&#039;t hesitate to share your experience.<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz<br />&nbsp;

				Same advices as everyone here, it&#039;s really better to do it with friends and in a comfortable place.<br />And don&#039;t be nervous. If you expect something bad, then something bad will happen.<br />On a side note, maybe experience another psychedelic like salvia before (Not the same day)<br />(1st time I tried, all of us but one tried salvia, and the only one who never experienced it had a bad trip. I think salvia is like &quot;test the water, even if it&#039;s not the same pool&quot; just to have a quick preview of what it could be like)

				My only advice, is feeling anxious during the come up (When the LSD is starting to take effect) is perfectly normal for inexperienced users, get your stuff from an avengers star vendor, its worth the price, and you can safely know that nothing bad is going to happen to you, its just a normal part of the experience, surround yourself with good things and people you enjoy and have a fucking blast! Its a terrific substance and one of my favorites.<br /><br />The red Microdots that are going around right now might be an excellent choice, or grab one of those 200~ug blotters from Fartbomber I think still had some? Maybe it was someone else, but yeah, stick to Avengers Star vendors and you&#039;re going to have a great time.

				My better advice: keep calm all the time, this is primordial<br /><br />Set and settings: never in hostils places&nbsp; (sorry for my poor English )<br /><br />No mix with nothing (alcohol, weed, and never, repeat, never, with speed or other stimulants)<br /><br />My favouryte set and setting is me alone in my house, and high dossage (minimun 3 blotters), but NEVER in you first trip, take 2 blotters max.<br /><br />My betters advices with my very poor english ;)<br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Index25
