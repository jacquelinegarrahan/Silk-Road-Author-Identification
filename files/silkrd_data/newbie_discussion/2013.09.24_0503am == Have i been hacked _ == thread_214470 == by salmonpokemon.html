				if the bitcoins are based on or connected to any fiatcurrency like dollars for example then the value will drop since its a fiatcurrency with buildt in inflasion and forever growing debts..

				Definitely sounds fishy.&nbsp; Have you looked at the address you deposited into on blockchain to try and see what happened to it, or if you could account for the difference?<br /><br />

				the number of bitcoins in your account stays the same, regardless of fiat currency fluctuations.<br /><br />if you were hacked your password normally would have been changed so you couldn&#039;t access your account, and the hacker would clear your out, they wouldn&#039;t leave over 3/4&#039;s of what you had. any clues in Account&gt;Account History?

				I have to admit mrmortimer, if you would have been hacked you weren&#039;t be able to access your account because of already changed login data from the &quot;hacker&quot;.<br />Also your SR account balance isn&#039;t connected to dollar fluctuations. You already bought the btcs.<br />Maybe you were too banged away and bought some?<br />Look at your orders or account history (your&#039;re right mrmortimer)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Greetings,<br />The Truth

				I agree with you guys if i was hacked they wouldn&#039;t take such a small amount and leave without changing the password. I have gone through my account history and it still doesn&#039;t add up. So i really have no idea wont went on but it seems to have stopped. But still i would like to figure out what has happened. Any other ideas guys ?
