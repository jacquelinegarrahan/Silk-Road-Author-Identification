				Indeed, it is tedious to have to post to reach 50 in order to have access to the main areas of the forum and 100 post to no longer need a captcha confirmation.<br /><br />Agreed. <br /><br />But, the bitcoin spammers, having taken advantage almost daily by spamming the forum necessitated that new policy. I know, it feels like collective punishment. But if you take a few minutes each day to post something, even a story in parts, in not time at all you&#039;ll reach your goal.

				Ah, I was not aware of the other perks. Thanks for enlightening me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read most of the classics. Definitely the two you mentioned, doestoevsky, camus, kerouac, etc it just seems more interesting than to ask questions or talk, than to spam.

				“So, now I&#039;ve been to see a drug counselor who told me I need to lay off the drugs and talk about my feelings, and a shrink who heard what I had to say and immediately put me on drugs.”<br />― Libba Bray, Going Bovine <br /><br />My take: give the individual the liberty to decide which drugs to take and when. Yet also provide them with the means to eliminate withdrawal. Withdrawal is a mockery of sorts. It simultaneously makes you hate and love the drug.

				“Now here&#039;s somebody who wants to smoke a marijuana cigarette. If he&#039;s caught, he goes to jail. Now is that moral? Is that proper? I think it&#039;s absolutely disgraceful that our government, supposed to be our government, should be in the position of converting people who are not harming others into criminals, of destroying their lives, putting them in jail. That&#039;s the issue to me. The economic issue comes in only for explaining why it has those effects. But the economic reasons are not the reasons”<br />― Milton Friedman
