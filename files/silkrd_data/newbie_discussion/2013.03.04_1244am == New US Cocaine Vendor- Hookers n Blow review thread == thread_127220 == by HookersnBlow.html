				Hi I am making a review thread for my listings here.<br />I am being run by a legitimate long time vendor and may get other long time members to vouch for my skills in stealth below.<br />I have small sample listings and discounted gram listings too. I also sell hookers phone numbers and am including one in the samples.<br />.1 Gram Samples&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bb6bca2475<br />$75 Grams&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b1c1e36249<br />Hookers&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f6cfa02533<br />Vendor profile&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/27dd3f7e3a

				Hey bro, I&#039;m looking forward to reviewing your sample!&nbsp; Did you send in priority or 1st class?&nbsp; I epected it to day but still nothing.&nbsp; Did you mark in transit before actually mailing it out.&nbsp; That seems to piss people off around here ::)&nbsp; No worries, though.&nbsp; Hopefullly it will make it here tomorrow!&nbsp; lPeace, man!<br /><br /><br />-nwpg

				I received my sample from Hookers n Blow. Got .096g, thanks! <br /><br />Quality was good, good euphoria. It wasn&#039;t the cleanest gear, kinda speedy but had no burn. It didn&#039;t have that strong smell of roots as I&#039;d have liked. good c numbing. <br /><br />Packaging: Heat sealed MBB, and the stealth is great, 10/5!<br /><br />Shipping: Very fast, I think it took 3 or 4 business days<br /><br />Overall: Smooth transaction, top notch stealth. Thanks for the sample

				Big Red Flag on your security!!! First of all phone #&#039;s really? I can log on to backpage and get a hundred phone numbers in my area. This smells like LE big time to me, just saying. The whole point of the road is anonymity and for you buyers its bad enough that you have to give an addy to link you to the transaction. I&#039;ve been in the game for a long time and the road really intrigues me, but come on people. Coca Cola is no jokeola in the courts. Calling &quot;Hookers&quot; even w/ a toss phone puts another link into the ball n chain that the man is trying to put on your asssss.<br />My opinion

				I received my 100 mg from HnB and the quality seemed clean with no active cuts.&nbsp; The sample didn&#039;t quite give me a bell ringer, but most coke takes a lil more than that.&nbsp; It did come in one pebble that didn&#039;t seem rerocked or anything.&nbsp; I think the price of his grams is fair for the purity of his product.&nbsp; There was a number included, but I don&#039;t fuck with hookers, as I&#039;ve been in a monogomous relationship for several years now.&nbsp; I would prolly be more inclined to check out backpage.com if I was looking for that.<br /><br />The best part of the package was the stealth.&nbsp; It was heat sealed mylar packaged in a very clever way!&nbsp; I would definitely order a gram from this vendor and recommend him to coke lovers... especially those who are very security minded!&nbsp; I definitely recommend this vendor.&nbsp; The only criticism I can think of is if he could ship a little quicker, but the stealth explains why it took a few days.&nbsp; I also urge the vendor not to mark in transit until it&#039;s actually in the post system.&nbsp; Otherwise, everything was perfect.&nbsp; Thanks HnB and welcome to the road!<br /><br />-nwpg

				Yeah the numbers where nothing special.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get beyond voice mail with any of them.&nbsp; Ended up picking&nbsp; an independent girl off backpage like always. Good times.

				I decided to give you a try and my first order sat in &quot;processing&quot; state for 3 business days and so ended up cancelling that one. So far with second order after 7 days from placing order and supposedly 5 business days &quot;in transit&quot; I still have not received it. Patently waiting and hoping on receiving it next week.&nbsp; :-\

				Gotta love how this vendor uses a photo that&#039;s not even theirs, blatantly lies about how their stuff is uncut/pure, blah blah blah, then you have people in the feedback saying how it&#039;s &quot;OK&quot;, and how it burned and how it gave a &quot;speedy effect to enjoy at a nightclub&quot;. How can these people accept that the dude listed shit as pure but it is obviously not at all, then give a 5 or even a 4 rating? &quot;Speedy effect to enjoy at a nightclub&quot;. ....Fuckingidiots at the nightclub enjoying their fake &quot;coke&quot;. When I buy coke, I want coke...not some amphetamine speed bullshit. I don&#039;t understand people sometimes.<br /><br />This vendor is full of shit / a scammer. FYI, I did not buy from them...I&#039;m not that stupid. I can still tell that they are full of shit and had to call them out on it in their review thread.
