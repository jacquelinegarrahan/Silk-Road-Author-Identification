				I vouch for ChronicConfections edibles, and when comes to the eating weed game, they got this in the bag, hands down !<br /><br />Just the sheer quality of the gooey goodness from his Mini Brownies, to his Famous Cracker Jacks, they all are top notch and exquisitely a delicious delicacy to come across and taste<br /><br />A small re-cap of his mini brownies, I had started off with the 1st one, on an empty stomach as I was deciding to chill all day, I had been out of bud to smoke, so I figured why not, what the heck right ?<br /><br />I had nothing to lose, and but everything to gain, I&nbsp; noticed, if i had no bud, I might as well try getting blazed up in other ways, and what better way than to indulge in a chronicy confection of our own device? <br /><br />I had Took my first bite of the brownie around 2 in the afternoon, I figured I can scarf this down, and within about an hour, I&#039;ll scarf the other down, or so i thought ...<br /><br />An hour had passed, and for some strange reason I felt like I had the munchies, but like in weird disbelief I couldn&#039;t muster the strength to get up off the bed, I soon felt like oh what the heck, and throw back the other brownies, since I was hungry right , well sure why not I thought !<br /><br />By the the time the second brownie went down, I couldn&#039;t come to the conclusion if I was really feeling tired, or just like lazy, and for some strange reason , I was still so hungry, i then remembered, CC had sent a extra caramel brownie, and just the look of it alone, had given me like weed shivers, seeing how the stuff is all made very potent, and i was like man, I bet it taste good, so I threw that edible back too and munched it down ! <br /><br />I swear within about the next hour I knew I had felt something settle in, and have me feeling like very &quot;dropped&quot; all droopy kinda like really your so&#039; tired you can&#039;t even hold your eyes open ? Well it was something like that, or like Nodding of some opiates, but man, this stuff was tuggin !<br /><br />I felt like my face was holding like a 50 pound weight or something, I just felt like a sloth, and now that I can recall, I was just waking up periodically like every 5 minutes just to gaze up, and knock out again !<br /><br />When it comes to everything else, the delivery, shipping and packaging are up to par, I would suggest maybe once they get a lil&#039; further on the road, of like using MBB&#039;s and maybe if they want like digital postage. Other than that they deliver awesome service and care about their customers sincerely.<br /><br />Word of advice, try not to eat too much because they will add up, and sit you down, take it from me, I&nbsp; been a smoker for like a strong 10 years, and have like a HULK tolerance I&#039;n not kidding I&#039;m like strong as a horse, but with these babies, your in for a first time high newbie experience, so please exercise a lil&#039; bit of precaution before having too much fun.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Image Link:<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wp.jpg ( Mini Brownies)<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wr.jpg (Caramel Brownie)<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/l7t.JPG (Rice Krispy &amp; Cracker Jacks)<br /><br />SR LINK:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/572d11cb30
