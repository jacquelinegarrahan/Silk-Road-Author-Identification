				I second this. I have been on the road for over a year now, but just recently tried ordering from FrankM allthough i am not a fan of his FE policy.<br /><br />So far i have had no problems with him. He is Friendly, and shipping is very fast. I have only tried ordering his Coke so far, but i must say that it is the best coke i have had from the road yet (I can only compare to C63 and Bungee, but Franks gear has been a notch better than C63, and far better than Bungee&#039;s first batch).<br /><br />Ive seen a few persons warning against FrankM on these forums, but all i can say is that i have been very happy with the transactions i have had so far with FrankM.<br /><br />Sincerely Candy

				I&#039;m reluctant to order from a vendor who asks everyone to FE. No matter how reliable everyone says he is, it&#039;s possible for that to change. Look at that arsehole Samgiaganta or whatever his name was. I have just put in an order from c63amg. I&#039;m not a new customer to the SR, I have plenty of transactions under my belt, I didn&#039;t like having to FE when I had under 3 transactions. It&#039;s best to avoid those vendors and go with someone who uses escrow, it&#039;s there for us, if you get ripped off after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d, you haven&#039;t a leg to stand on, no help from SR. I&#039;m not risking it.

				I know I may get karma hit by this, but in my (still brief) experience with SR, the only order I made out of 12 that didnt make it was one of 2 (small) orders i did to him. I&#039;m waiting for a reship on the one that didnt get through, but I have my doubts about that reship. I&#039;m just a noob around here but I have to say that his stealth is not at all the best I&#039;ve seen, in fact it&#039;s quite the opposite.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents of experience.

				I&#039;ve had one good order from him. I don&#039;t like to FE either, but its hard to find a vendor willing to stay in escrow for international orders. If there are no local vendors for a particular product (like No4 H) there isn&#039;t much option but take the risk. If you look at how much he turns over in a week, it must be tempting for him to retire at some point and take everyone&#039;s BTC with him. On the other hand, an operation that size, he must have a team working for him, so it would be risky for him too. I get the feeling he&#039;s in it for the long haul, so risk is pretty low IMO.

				My opinion is he doesnt care much about small orders... If you see only small orders have to FE, so I dont think it&#039;s anything as you say, if you want to run with the $$$ you&#039;d make FE the big orders!<br /><br />But he&#039;s not the guy for occasional buyers, at least not for me.

				Seems to me that it&#039;s going downhill with Frank. Having a buttload of orders each day raises the chances of making mistakes...I remember I had no problems with him whatsoever&nbsp; the first few months he was selling. Then the number of his customers started to grow exponentially and so did the undelivered packages.

Just have patience and he will help you out, he has a lot of orders already and im sure he&#039;s doing his best to keep his business is running smoothly. I had a problem with a shipping order and he sent it from Europe to north America within 3 days. He is not 1 % for nothing.<br />Have faith in FM<br />Shades<br />

				Frank Matthews is one of the best vendors on SR. Have huge respect for the way he does business, and the communication he does when there is issues. Ordered from him 4 or 5 times and will order from him time and time again! Go to FM for quality product with non inflated prices, like some drugs here in Canada.<br />Cheers<br />Shades

				Although he asks to FE most of the time, he isn&#039;t like some of those other vendors who will fuck you over. His product is top notch (only tried the coke and h) and the price isn&#039;t inflated like a lot of places around here in Canada. Rarely is there an issue, and when there is, Frank is always quick to communicate and resolve it. I have ordered from him time and time again and will continue to!!! Thumbs up for one of the BEST vendors on SR.<br />Cheers<br />Shades

				Gonna place an order with FM, just wanted a little feedback as I&#039;m in the UK, read a lot about them just wanted to know what to expect from the packaging quality wise (heard they made good improvements recently to the packaging ?) And does it come through with normal mail or do you have to sign. PM please as i don&#039;t want to give away anything to do with his stealth and such, just looking for more assurance as haven&#039;t order from abroad yet on SR.&nbsp;

				I came here from a link on another thread.<br /><br />The person posting says the following...<br /><br />&quot;As a mod may see this before they do in the other thread, Infowars have pasted more addresses in the Frank Matthews thread. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?reportsent;topic=128745.msg1309669#msg1309669&quot;<br /><br />Not sure if this is mischief going on. I&#039;ve sometimes thought about buying off Frank Matthews but I&#039;d not be going FE for anyone really. I&#039;ve paid my dues and been banged for a few pounds when I did have to go FE when first joining. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think its an issue if say someone just joins, and they buy a gram of bud and have to FE. <br /><br />I do know Frank Matthews is top of the charts here for coke. Maybe that pisses other vendors off. However, some people have chimed in here and I respect their opinions because, I listen to buyers not vendors who, you have to admit, are not always honest and forthcoming. Most are but this is drugs, you have to expect any drug transaction to attract the creature known as a scammer. Boith customer and vendor can be such. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;d like someone to clear up this accusation regarding &#039;infowars&#039;. Thought that was some radical American guys site so wtf would he be doing publishing addresses of a few small time buyers? Or is it some other &#039;infowars&#039;? And whose addresses were published? Did anyone actually see this and if so, I&#039;m sure SR staff would be all over it like a harem of hookers on Jim Morrisons dick. <br /><br />Sorry to throw this one in here Frank, but you might as well see it first hand and defend yourself!<br /><br />I for one, don&#039;t have any malice towards you. Not dealt with you. Hope that this matter is maybe sorted out. <br /><br />Don&#039;t shoot the messanger!
