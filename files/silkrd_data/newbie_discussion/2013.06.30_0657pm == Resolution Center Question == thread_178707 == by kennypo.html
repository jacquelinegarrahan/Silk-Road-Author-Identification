				Title: <strong>Resolution Center Question</strong><br />

				Hello all. I have been on the road for awhile now but I&#039;m new to the forum. My question is about how the resolution center works. I&#039;ve been lucky enough that in close to a year on here i haven&#039;t had any problems with orders until now. I placed an order over 2 weeks ago and never received it. I didn&#039;t FE or anything but I haven&#039;t received the order since I placed it and it was marked in transit and the seller has not responded to any of my messages since then. When the option to resolve came up a few days ago i asked for a 100% refund and explained to SR why. Well since then the vendor still hasn&#039;t responded and in 2 days the order is due. My question is when the 2 days are up will my order just auto finalize or will i just get a refund since the vendor has not responded to anything including the resolution request. I would just like to know from anyone&#039;s experience what the process is. It appears the vendor has disappeared so it doesn&#039;t seem like there will be much to resolve but i&#039;m just worried my order will autofinalize. Thanks to anyone who can shed some light on this.
