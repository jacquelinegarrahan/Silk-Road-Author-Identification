				It&#039;s these weak-assed scammers (both sellers AND buyers) that will always be around to undermine the road if we let them. <br /><br />Be cautious!<br /><br />Building trust starts with respect. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been waiting on one order myself for much longer than it should&#039;ve taken and had to extend the auto finalize time. You won&#039;t see me naming the vendor or talking a bunch of shit on the forums about this person. I am giving them a chance to resolve things with class as I would to if I were them. It&#039;ll work out and hopefully neither or our stats will be affected.<br /><br />Show some class people and stay safe!<br />
