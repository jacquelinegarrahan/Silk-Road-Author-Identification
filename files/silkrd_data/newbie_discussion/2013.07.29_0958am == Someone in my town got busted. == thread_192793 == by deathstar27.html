				All I heard was he signed for a package (big mistake) and the LE busted straight into the house and seized everything.<br /><br />I heard it was coke that he &quot;bought online&quot;. <br /><br />Coke is fairly good in my town so it was more than likely a large order so maybe he had to sign (vendor rules) ... I know of this guy a little and he is fairly scummy, the type of guy that gives nice drug dealers a bad name so maybe was just too stupid to go about it the smart way and I&#039;m not 100% sure that the order was from SR.<br /><br />but just thought I&#039;d let you guys know you&#039;re probably a lot safer not signing for orders and risking losing your package then spending your life behind bars.

				Sometimes I wish this place couldn&#039;t be found with a simple google search. It would weave out the people with half a brain. NEVER EVER EVER sign for an order. That&#039;s literally signing your life away. A simple &quot;I didn&#039;t order anything. Return To Sender.&quot; is all it takes. They will be persistent and try to get you to accept the package but under no circumstances should you sign for that package. Another thing to keep in mind is never order drugs to your base of operations. Always make sure you&#039;re sending it to a clean house with no illegal substances in the house. I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s weed and you live in California. ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP A CLEAN HOUSE. Any word if the guy is going to prison?

				I do not understand the paranoia and rumors that go around about signing for packages.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone care to explain how signing for receipt of a package makes you a criminal when you are not aware of the contents?&nbsp; Signing is not a big deal...<br /><br />It all sounds like FUD to me.<br /><br />That said... you should always have a clean house; and illicit substances and paraphernalia should not be in plain sight.

				There are a few different types of buyers on Silk Road.&nbsp; Two of these types of buyers are small fries and big guys.&nbsp; Small fries have no reason to sign and they usually order domestic.&nbsp; Big guys have to sign because all express mail from many international countries requires a signature or the vendor sends with tracking which requires a signature.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a small fry then you can keep chanting don&#039;t sign don&#039;t sign don&#039;t sign.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a big guy then you have already signed and you know that it is a requirement for many types of shipments from many countries.<br /><br />I sign when I expect to sign.&nbsp; I don&#039;t sign when I don&#039;t expect to sign.&nbsp; To each their own.

				I&#039;ve signed for intn&#039;l packages. It was fine. Have a sibling/friend/roomate sign for it. If the DEA crashes down your door, then the signer merely says &quot;I&#039;m not Bob Jones, I had no idea what was in that package, I just didn&#039;t want Bob to have to go to the post office cause he was napping&quot; and Bob says &quot;I wasn&#039;t expecting a package, I didn&#039;t order any drugs&quot;. Hell, I&#039;ve had my mom receive a lot of times she didn&#039;t even have to sign when signature was required for tracking. &quot;He&#039;s taking a nap&quot;.
