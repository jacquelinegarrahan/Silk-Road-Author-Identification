				It&#039;s supposed to a sort of table of contents of the undernet and tor sites. I&#039;ve tried to find links and they all lead to 404s. Is this just some made up business? Maybe the sites down? Would be cool if anyone could shed light on this matter, thanks.

				Theres supposed to be a decent supplier to Steroids on there, finding gear that is backed up by people who have used the product and can attest to it working is hard to find on the SR and forums. Most people give 5/5s for it coming in, but who knows if 4 weeks down the line the gear is bunk? I don&#039;t know if you can go back and edit a rating that far.<br /><br />Nothing on the forums either about peoples experiences besides duds. Steroids is the one tricky thing to buy on the SR, its not like other things here where you &quot;take it&quot; and can tell within the next few hours whether its legit. Plus...you don&#039;t want to inject just anything into your body, as someone who trains, you try to respect your body in that sense. Me and a friend have scored Meth/MDMA/etc. off the SR and it all went well. So thats why I&#039;m trying to get gear here due to the positive experience I had...its just not as easy as I&#039;d hoped in terms of assurance.

				If you are looking for any type of info you can trust I would not recommend the hidden wiki. It has linked me to scam sites numerous times (when I first discovered the onion network). Granted, I never fell for any of them but some of them were pretty damn good. Ultimately I think it is a cesspool, I have yet to find anything good on&nbsp; there or on the numerous nodes and directories that it connects you to. As a person who has a decent knowledge of medicine, biology, and organic chemistry, I believe that most of the negative side affects you might be worried about (besides impurity of substance) would be to not cycling or tapering correctly or choosing a more dangerous chemical to cycle with in general. For more information in regards to these things I would suggest a steroid-friendly bodybuilding forum with reputable status, and find what method suits you best in regards to your training experience, desired administration route, and ultimately what compound you decide to work with.<br /><br />Sorry, not trying to lecture lol I have a tendency to ramble.<br /><br />End all be all I would still suggest the road to purchase whatever you decide on.
