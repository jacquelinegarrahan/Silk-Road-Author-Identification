				Health Canada is currently working on new regulations that will create a commercial market for marijuana. I have acquired knowledge through courses and research on the regulatory affairs and issues of medical marijuana. If one was interested in entering the Canadian market, I can provide help with licensing, inspections, operations and procedures, importing and exporting, and other related issues.<br /><br />Do you think there are people on here in search of advice on entering the Canadian medical marijuana market? <br /><br />People in Canada who want to get in on it, or even those from other countries who want to get in on it or sell to those licensed to sell in Canada?

				That&#039;s incredible, seems opposite to the direction Harper has been steering towards. The city of Toronto has been getting more lenient, as seen in the growing number of vapor lounges, and it&#039;s such a nice feature of the city.

				I think it would be great if you could give public advice on this subject, however keep in mind this is a &quot;newbie&quot; section. Although some of us here might not be &quot;noobs&quot; to the game, we still are to the forum. I think any legitimate distributor&#039;s capable of commercial operations would be a little wiser than to send information about their business to a john doe with 3 posts, let alone have the time to spend searching through this section. I also would find it hard to picture someone forking over cash or product, if that&#039;s what your after. Maybe you could help us all out by making a few informative posts about this immense &quot;knowledge&quot; that you have acquired?&nbsp; If you are after the money, I would suggest posting a BTC address along with any informative post asking for donations.
