				CrystalShip sent me a express package that took two days to get to my house. He forgot to waive the singnautre, so when the mailman knocked on my door, and asked me to sign a slip for a package that had felony narcotics in it, I declined. After messaging CrystalShip this is his responce, <br /><br />&quot;You asked for express and USPS asking for a signature is always a risk with express because the USPS personnel sometimes fail to change it in the computer. Most people on SR have had to sign for a package like that at one time or another and the fact is, if you bothered to discuss the matter with an attorney, signing for a package does not make culpable for its contents nor does not signing for it absolve you of possession, IF they can show that after receiving it, you opened it, aware of the contraband within and made no effort to report it to authorities. I&#039;ve certainly signed for my share of packages&quot;<br /><br />I am out $150 because of his mistake, and he refuses to take responsibility! No drugs, no money. Thanks crystalship!

Kind of hilarious, kind of sad. The moment you mail it back to sender, you need to realize that the sender *probably* wouldn&#039;t put their own address on the box. If cops wanted to bust you for possession, they could do so with or without your signature.

				I&#039;m a law grad. Studied enough cases about possession in crim law. Get over yourself. The responsibility for your safety goes both ways. Any person who isn&#039;t even expecting a package would sign for the fucking package and would say &quot;Are you sure? I&#039;m not expecting anything, weird.&quot; Of course if you order drugs to your home you need to make sure that you have no drugs or paraphernalia at the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				lookmomthedeepweb: You know what else buyers&#039; guide says?<br />&quot; Use a different address, such as a friend&#039;s house or P.O. box, that is unrelated to the one where your item will be kept. Once the item arrives, transport it discreetly to its final destination. Avoid abandoned buildings or any place where it would be suspicious to have mail delivered.&quot; ---- YOU DIDN&#039;T DO THAT. <br />&nbsp;&amp; &quot; do not answer the door for the postman, let him leave it there and then transport it as described above.&quot; ---- YOU DIDN&#039;T DO THAT EITHER<br />-----<br />Now you&#039;re all acting like the buyers&#039; guide is your holy bible.<br />Get a mailboxes, etc. address and you never have to sign shit again.

				From what I gather, It&#039;s apparently a meth vendor named infinitesource trying to talk shit about another meth vendor &#039;crystalship&#039;... so he can call the other meth vendor a scammer in a different thread called &quot; Re: Meth vendors and product reviews&quot;.
