				Before I found SR it had been about 13 years since I&#039;d had any LSD, since then I have indulged from OrderOfThePhoenix, Jackie Chan, BongSong and TheDrugFederation.....so thankful for SR and quality LSD! Oh and by the way, I am well stocked for the foreseeable future!!!

				I am always surprised at how many of my customers are doing LSD for the first time. Always good to know it is the real deal and high purity.

				I wouldn&#039;t even think about getting these off the street. I&#039;m just waiting for &#039;Jannis&#039; to come back since they sell the AL-LADs which are told to be shorter in duration and less mind fucking.<br /><br />I have never done acid before but it sounds to me like 12 hours of tripping is waaaay too much. <br />I&#039;ve done only marijuana, mdma and coke so far.

When I opened my mail from albionessentials I really thought he&#039;d forgotten to put anything in, after a moment of panic it suddenly clicked that there was only one place they could be and I was already holding them :)
