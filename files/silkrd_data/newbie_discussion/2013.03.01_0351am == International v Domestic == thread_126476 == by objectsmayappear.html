				Personally I&#039;d be way too freaked out to order anything that would have to go through customs. If there was a poll option I&#039;d put one up but how do you all feel about ordering internationally, would you chance it?

				It isn&#039;t worth playing the odds.&nbsp; Yes most international packs make it although every time you play your odds of getting caught increase.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t want to risk my freedom (and more).<br /><br />The guys that go to jail aren&#039;t coming back to SR and reporting it.&nbsp; Controlled deliveries do happen.&nbsp; People do go to jail, often for a long time.&nbsp; It costs a lot of money too.

				Bear in mind if you are receiving drugs through the mail whether domestically or not then there is always a risk. Yes domestic is the less risky way to do it, but if you want to get a better quality product/ better price/ something unavailable domestically then ordering internationally becomes a more attractive option. If you weigh the risks against the benefits and you think it&#039;s worth it then go ahead. <br /><br />Drugs going through customs makes two outcomes more likely. First is that you will lose your drugs and your money, second is that you will&nbsp; lose your drugs and your money and also end up being arrested and/or having your place searched. <br /><br />The first outcome (depending on the amount, what kind of drug, and the laws in your country) is a hell of a lot more likely than the second. This is because unless you live in some kind of insane dictatorship, the fact that someone sent you drugs in the mail does not make you guilty of anything at all. It takes a lot of precious man hours for police to prove that you ordered and paid for drugs in the mail, hence the existence of the customs love letter.<br /><br />Some basic things to safeguard yourself are to have no drugs or evidence of illegal activity in your house or computer/storage devices. Don&#039;t tell anyone about your dealings on the Silk Road or on any online drug market place, because if you do then you are fucked because it&#039;s extremely likely they will rat you out if questioned. If you have these basics covered then the only thing you have to worry about is yourself. By this I mean are you prepared to be interrogated and intimidated without folding? Do you know your rights, etc? Knowing for sure you personally can deal with police in the correct way is the single biggest safeguard to protecting yourself, and it is not something that comes naturally to the average person.<br /><br /><br />

				depends on your country you&#039;re in and where you want to get shit from...<br />I consider the whole of EU as domestic shipping (even think this should be a filter in the &#039;domestic&#039; tick box on SR).<br /><br />No doubt domestic is a little safer, but countries which send a lot of mail to your country should also be quite safe (e.g. Canada &amp; USA, UK &amp; commonwealth countries...etc)

				This is my first post.&nbsp; Here is why I do not order internationally or anything larger than personal consumption size.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/02/tulane_students_arrested_after.html#incart_river<br /><br />While I don&#039;t know these fucking retards personally,&nbsp; this happened to be less than 2 miles away from me.&nbsp; Talk about close to home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never sign for anything*****************<br />Always keep a clean house (literally &amp; figuratively)*********************<br />If detained, say nothing, say nothing, say nothing***********************<br /><br />I&#039;ve donated enough of my life &amp; money to the state for making stupid mistakes when I was younger.&nbsp; I have no desire to get stuck back in the shitstem again.&nbsp; Always realize the full scope of your actions &amp; be prepared to deal with them, good or bad.&nbsp;

				Carrying a package into your house is at least as bad as signing for it.

				Signed for a package once last order with Nod, Balls went straight into my stomach asked why i needed to sign said it was voided on the package (Express overnight shpping), It was the usual mailman said he just usually tries to get it anyway and it I really didn&#039;t need to and if I wasn&#039;t there he was just gonna leave it, so i said fuck it(I know im fucking stupid save me the lecture). Paranoid as a motherfucker for the nest hour but nothing happened figured i wouldve got fucked on the spot. Have had friends send several decoy packages and done alot of internet shopping with priority and express shipping to the same address and have since used a different address for SR since, but I think Im safe it&#039;s been about 2-3 weeks now and I am pretty active in the game

				Yeah I usually avoid ordering or shipping international. Overall its still really small chances but comparatively its too much of an increase. I&#039;ll ship if they finalize early and I don&#039;t take the chances but thats about it.

				I&#039;ll order international if they have great reviews and a good refund policy. Other than that, domestic only.
