				&nbsp;Total transactions: 9<br />Total spent: $1309.43<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 10 days<br /><br />Good fucking start. This is the best place I&#039;ve ever been to in my life and it doesn&#039;t exist in my real life.<br />I ONLY went domestic though, too worried about customs.<br /><br />Some of the packaging was so outstanding that I had trouble getting to it even when I knew it was there.<br /><br />Mrouid is by far my favorite vendor. Amazing speed/stealth/product combo.<br /><br />Tessellated is a wonderful vendor to deal with.<br /><br />I even was able to keep my coins long enough to recover from the crash and actually have more money than I started with.<br /><br />I love you SR.<br /><br />Start of a beautiful friendship.

				Loving this post!<br /><br />Silk Road is heaven on earth. I wish the entire world would see how good this place works and that everyone would adapt to a new world where everyone is more free and not controlled by governments and other people. Let each person be he&#039;s own and not let people decide for others.<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe that people are satisfied with the fact that a handful of other people decide what millions of others can and cannot do. As long people does stuff that doesn&#039;t harm anyone else. You should be free to do what you choose.

				Ahh yes, this is the best place in the world.<br /><br />To answer a few questions, I did order a lot all at once, had me a bit paranoid but I am at a building that gets quite a few packages daily so as long as the addressing was all done properly (which it was) once the packages got here I know that they would be safe. Also as I mentioned all domestic, no signing, no huge orders...<br /><br />Have more on the way:)<br /><br />Love you SR.. I don&#039;t think this will end soon:)

				That&#039;s a pretty grand beginning. Good on you, sir. I&#039;ve barely spent that amount in over a year. I imagine things would be different had I discovered SR earlier...

Really what I tried to do was not think about it at all, every time I did I thought of running to cancel the orders/contact the vendor. But when one of my orders showed up while the road was down before I even knew that they had sent it out, and the stealth was just really amazing (mrouid) I just ran to the mailbox every morning all giddy.<br /><br />One day like 6 orders showed up at once in a big pile (mmmhuhuuhuhhhahahahaha!) (a lil reckless I know but it really was a bunch of small stuff and mostly blended in with my regular mail..i did what i felt was ok and it was in the end)<br /><br />A guy I know by there sarcastically asked if I was in the importing business! little did he know.<br /><br />I feel like I was a part of this place before I knew of it... its like an extension of my imagination/desires... it really changes the way I see the world though... I going to try to keep my interest relatively lower than it has been even because I see the potential for a personal disaster...(ie the crazy nausea I had today)<br /><br />Anyways... have fun, stay safe all... it works if you know how to work it is the way I will think of it.
