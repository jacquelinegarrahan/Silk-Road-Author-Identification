				Hm well did you save your blockchain wallet id and password somewhere else? Or save or memorize the recovery phrase? Your BTC would still be in blockchain, but if you don&#039;t have the details to log in or recover your wallet, then I would say it&#039;s gone. I would say there is nearly zero chance blockchain would recover/give you that info because they have no way to know if you are the real owner of the wallet.<br /><br />Now if you had that info saved in just plain e-mails, maybe someone guessed your e-mail account password, or the information was otherwise stolen. If that occurred they probably transferred all the BTC out your blockchain wallet right away.

				I tried a lot at the domain.<br />When i would enter i get this message: <br />Your e-mail address has been locked or has not been activated yet. If you have any questions, please contact us. <br /><br />So if wrote the incorrect password 5 times, i would be informed about it.<br /><br />And i can´t get contact to the admin.<br /><br />And i heard from some other users, that their account from other emaildomains closed their account to!<br />web.de, secure-email.biz, and they even had a libertyreserveaccount on this email.

				you really think so?<br />Maybe i am well known in the area i am present, but the FBI from oversee?<br />Maybe i changes thousand - two thousand of LR € in BTC, not more.<br /><br />And if the domainadmin is not lying, the goverment coudln´t get infos about whats in the account.<br /><br />&quot;All email traffic is transferred through an SSL encrypted connection between customer&#039;s email software and our secure email servers.

				So for all how are interested on this topic,<br />it only could be someone who was interested in the LR purchases with the account,<br />or the owner of nodns.org stolen all my information!<br />So if someone use this domain, be careful!

				bump<br /><br />I&#039;m keeping an eye on this and all btc storage, acquisition, thefts, regulations, EVERYTHING i can<br /><br />This whole thing all hinges on us being able to safely purchase and sell/redeem btc and not just the truly slick IT guys here, but also the little guys using some very plane jane ways compared to others. They may be more important as they have numbers and numbers mean something. I know I use bitinstant often which is as basic as it gets and works flawlessly( reading the forums it would seem most/many would disagree) so far for me and has got super fast this past week for some reason with new site as guest. I don&#039;t know. benn like 4-6 min and I&#039;m done! I swear. I was always happy with an hour or so.<br /><br />sorry, got off topic. I hope everything works out in the end but I am curious, you never answered homeboys question about back up and or having any info to go to blockchain with. If we don&#039;t know that, we really don&#039;t know much. I don&#039;t kow why people think it&#039;s funny? Yes you could be full of shit, or it could be all your fault, but none of us know that you are either of those things and if it was the latter, that happens and its not funny in any way.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Luck. <br /><br />EDIT: clarity and spelling corrections EDIT: the clarity part didn&#039;t work too good 1st try

				&nbsp;:)<br />I would try concentrate on recovery of the info lost, no le or what ever is gonna spend a shed load of dollars&nbsp; to trap someone with a history of less than 50K in transactions from LR.<br /><br />They got the people they wanted they shut it down which they wanted to do, there all to busy drinking champaine n shit atm and possible looking for large money movers that was dumb enough to leave a trail. <br /><br />Go smoke a spliff relax a bit.&nbsp; :P

				I thank you guys;)<br />I am a positive thinking person and do the best to be happy.<br />But such things pull me down sometimes.<br />Its ok, because you learn with all of your faults.<br /><br />It throw me really down now ,didn´t get on the wallet yet.<br /><br />I really hope the blockchain support will contact me and we could find a solution.<br /><br />Maybe the admin of nodns.org fill his bags with money.
