				I have been using Dwolla&gt;Bitinstant&gt;mtGox&gt;SR for some time now and it seems like Bitinstant is no longer viable nor is MtGox.&nbsp; I see all this talk about local wallets and other ways but I haven&#039;t figured out how to do it.&nbsp; Anybody have a link, thread, or wiki explaning the best and safest way to get BTC to SR now?<br /><br />Thx!

				I&#039;m having the same problem with my regular guys, blockchain and bitinstant. I&#039;m thinking of trying Bitcoin-Brokers.org . I can&#039;t seem to find any reviews or feedbacxk about them though and they&#039;re shutdown for the next week. The website looks like they have a pretty simple and fast process though. Anyone out there used them???<br />I hope bitinstant get&#039;s there shit together .

				I was having the same problem and needed to get some coins on fast. So I tried&nbsp; LocalBitcoins (dot)com.<br />You can find someone in your area that will do pretty much any kind of transaction you&#039;re comfortable with. Including face to face, and bank drops. They also have an escrow service and feedback rating or each broker.<br />I don&#039;t see why you need to pick someone local, unless you want to do a face to face though. <br />I really like the whole bank deposit thing and found a guy that had my coins moving on blockchain less than 10 minutes after I put the funds in his US Bank account. <br />He did charge 10%, but having an honest broker that lets me deposit coins the way I like is worth it IMO.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				So what is the deal with this localbitcoin site.&nbsp; Are there people out there that just walk in for you in the store to purchase the coins and then charge you a little to pass them off to you.&nbsp; What happens to the original buyer if for some crazy ass reason he get&#039;s accused of using the coins for illegal activity?&nbsp; Would he just say, i sold them online anon style ? would that be sufficient for his release ?&nbsp; And if so, why don&#039;t we just get them ourselves and use the same excuse, or wash them around online?&nbsp; Essentially wouldn&#039;t that mean that every bitcoin that has ever been used for an illegal transaction has some tracer of whomever had to show his/her face on the camera during time of purchase at whatever location?&nbsp;
