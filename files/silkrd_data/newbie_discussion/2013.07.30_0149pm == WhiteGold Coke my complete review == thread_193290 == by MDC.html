				After last night I can confirm that I am very happy that I followed my instincts by trying WhiteGold.<br /><br />A brief introduction. I do not write on the forum lately because I don’t thik it’s necessary, for esample Bungee54&nbsp; really not needs other reviews. <br /><br />In addition, the advent of the 50 minimum post that does not count the age of the account or the quality of the post, had finally moved me away from writing on the forum.<br /><br />But I‘m very satisfied of Wahitegold’s coke and there are no other reviews of him. So I feel it’s my duty to share with the community my happy discovery of a serious seller and a great product. It’s my opinion this coke is one the best I tried here on SR.<br /><br />The review:<br /><br />I ordered 1g.<br /><br />WG answered all my questions in a gentle mood and he was fast. Communication: 10/10.<br /><br />The letter follows all the rules to hide the Coke inside in a MBB bags. I smiled when I found it in my mailbox. Shipping:10/10<br /><br />The gram was overweight. The coca was powder with small dry rocks, were hard to chunk, but not so much to jump away from the plate. Excellent.<br /><br />the effect was gradual, really euphoric, no bad physical change or the heartbeat or bad changes in the face. It &#039;s very numbing in the mouth, but it’s like a good coke. I havn’t felt the need to redose, it means it can come down and after a few hours do another. I&#039;ve finished sharing it. I had no down problems and I fell asleep after two pages of a book and a melatonin. With just one nostril closed, It was the least used. Maybe one line wasn’t completely pulverized. Today I woke up well, two blow and the day started. Product: 9.5/10<br /><br />I&#039;m glad that I trusted WhiteGold, Coca is really good, one of the best I&#039;ve found here. <br />If&nbsp; WG&nbsp; keeps hes promises, he will be my trusted vendor with Bungee. Their products are different but comparable in quality. Soon I will do my new order. And it comes from Spain, which it makes me feel even more safe.<br /><br />MDC
