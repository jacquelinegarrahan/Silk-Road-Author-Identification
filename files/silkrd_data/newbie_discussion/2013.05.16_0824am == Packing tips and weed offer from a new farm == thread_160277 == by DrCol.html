				Hi all<br /><br />So, am pretty much set up to sell now...have wonderful crop of blueberry kush and some sweet pricing for anyone who wants some....especially as a newbie I&#039;d like to price well and get some reviews/feedback.<br /><br />One other thing, I have a vacuum machine and then heat sealing in foil...popping that into a simple jiffy with printed address labels...any other tips or am I pretty much as good as I can get in terms of stealthy sending?<br /><br />Thanks all....look forward to you coming to see me soon<br /><br />Doc

				Good start on the vac seal, and mylar. <br /><br />Always wear 2 pairs of latex gloves when packing. One pair has been shown to leave latent prints. <br />Always, when packing marijuana, wash each vac seal with soap, or wipe it down with rubbing alcohol in between vac seals, and before heat sealing in mylar as well. <br /><br />Practice these measures and youll be safe and secure. Much love.

				Thanks so much for the valuable advice....<br /><br />I saw just shown &quot;sniffy bags&quot; (apparently bloody brilliant - developed to pack food when camping near bear territory (though why you&#039;d do that I have no idea!!!)<br /><br />Anyone have any experience or feedback on them...quite expensive per bag, but seem convenient...<br /><br />Oh and come on over there&#039;s some cost price samples now... <br /><br />Thanks again :)<br /><br />Doc

				What is the benefit of rubbing the package in alcohol and washing it?<br /><br />I do it myself all the time but I ask myself...<br />If there are dogs they are going to smell it for a 100%.<br />Dogs can smell under water for like 100 meters.

I just can&#039;t comment on what solvent dissolves all cannabanoids that a dog could possibly pick up on. You&#039;ve got THC, CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN (the ones I&#039;ve heard of) - maybe more than that. You need to find a common solvent, or a couple, that are OTC and common, that dissolve all or most of those. Then you are good to go. I&#039;m not sure if there is anything behind IPA/bleach or whatever else people use, except the fact that laymen know that it &quot;kills&quot; germs. I don&#039;t have all the MSDS&#039;s on all the cannabanoids, so like I said I can&#039;t comment, but you&#039;re probably better off with the IPA and/or bleach dip than without it. Take as much as you can off every one of those seals. It seems to be working for most vendors, thusfar.
