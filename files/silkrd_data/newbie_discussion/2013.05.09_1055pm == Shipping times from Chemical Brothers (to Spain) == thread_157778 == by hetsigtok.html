				Ok so I ordered some X from CB on Tuesday and he said he would ship it Wednesday. I have a big party next Saturday and I rly want some goodies till then. So anyone with experience from CB or ordering from Netherlands please post how long it took for your package to arrive. Im not sure if it will arrive at latest on Saturday next week so Im thinking of buying some speed from BM too so Ill have something nice on the weekend if my package from CD dont make it through on time ( shipping times is no problem for BM since its domestic for me). So what do you guys think, will it arrive within 10 days to Spain? If it is a good chance of arriving in 10 days I wont order anything from BM, but if its not I have to get some speed instead.<br /><br />I tried to do some research on shipping times but havent found much. And I know it varies but to get some kind of average would be nice and make my decision a lot easier. <br /><br />Feedback on this would be much appreciated.

				These are my experiences on intl shipping. <br /><br />You could check these things out on the postal service site in NL and Spain. Seriously. It will give you just as good information as asking anyone here. Delivery times internationally are notoriously irregular and varies greatly if you dont use some sort of express tracked service or pay-extra-delivery. <br /><br />I have had packages sent at the same time by the same person arriving 5 days apart! Also packages have taken from 2 to 7 days from the same source with the same postage. I don know about NE--&gt;Spain (my two favorite countries btw) but i suppose that if you use regular shipping you will not get any wiser from others experiences since its so varied and random sometimes. <br /><br />I would think that you will have your order in time though but why not check out the postal service delivery times between your countries? 10 days should be enough. Ask the vendor what it usually takes and then hang back and wait for your order to arrive.<br /><br />

				I have been trying to get some info on the postal service in Spain but the thing is I just moved here and dont know any spanish.. So getting information about that is pretty hard. Havent checked how it is in NL but Ive heard that it should be one of the fastest in Europe. <br /><br />Thinking of playing it safe and order some speed domestic although I would much rather do some X. <br /><br />anyway, thanks for your feedback.

				I&#039;ve used CM 5 times. Always arrived in 5 days or so. Be a little patient. Dunno bout you but it was Nintendos for me, flawless stealth (across borders), best E&#039;s I&#039;ve ever had. I think they are straight up. So be cool.<br /><br />Have a great party, can I have an invite&nbsp; :)

				No, but there are always cheap flights to Spain and I&#039;ve got a credit card to pay with!<br /><br />Seriously, hope it comes through for you, as I said they&#039;ve been spot on for me.<br /><br />Once smuggled some shrooms across in the old &#039;jail wallet&#039; and did them on an isolated beach on the Costa Brava with my girl, watching Venus rise over the Med. Beautiful experience.<br /><br />Take care.

Once i saw someone maybe being a policia civil sleeping on a pin chair near the exit that could have been in customs but there was no check whatsoever. Unless you come from outside of Schengen... then it≈õ the normal routine i suppose, i can say.
