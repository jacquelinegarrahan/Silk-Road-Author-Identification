				Hi all,<br /><br />Im new to to the silkroad forums. Not new to the the silkroad community. <br /><br />I want to warn my fellow SR users. Please do not do any business with the vendor Dr Holland. Because you will lose all your money and time. This fucking prick scammed me, and im not the only one. If i go to his profile, a lot of people are already scammed by this douchebag. <br /><br />Please, SR staff could you remove this fucking faggot his account? Because it would be a shame, if more people will get scammed. I&#039;m very angry, because i had a party tonight, and didn&#039;t received the dope! So the party is gonna be 1 big disaster, and i am scammed for about 30 euros.<br /><br />So please, SR staff remove or ban Dr Holland his account. And to my fellow SR users, DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING at DR HOLLAND. Because you will lose your money guaranteed! <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />pencilsnapper (Netherlands)<br />

Just hate to see scammers getting away with this shit so easily. There is a search box in the upper right hand corner, and whole forum sections dedicated to reviewing vendors. Any vendor without almost uniformly great reviews I consider suspect. Any vendor with no reviews isn&#039;t worth it as a newb either.

				I got a Half Gram of H from DR.holland alost 3 months ago, He sent it for free cause at the time he wanted help promoting his name,, Well first it took 24 days to arrive, and when i looked at tjhe post date it was cause he had just sent it a week before.. I did his whole hALF gRAM in 25 Min.. I felt a tiny bit of something but not worth wasting your money at all!!!<br /><br />Then he told me he was sending me some more to make up for some supposly #4 H he got out of no where, Of course that never showed either.. Im a ling time Member of SR and i will saythis just read his vendor Profile and If that alone does not make your decision then you need to re evaluate your decision making skills.. <br /><br />I cant say he scammed me, but he is FOS.. Iv emailed him since i started using the road again asking him WTF was up with my reship.. Of course no reply. So fuck him..<br /><br />I suggest No one give him business and if you do DONT U DARE FE FOR HIM, IF HE SAYS THATS THE ONLY WAY HE WILL SHIP TELL HIM WELL THANKS ANYWAY MATE!! And find someone else.. If your new and Need &amp; r looking for certain products MSG me and im glade to help, Iv been the newbie before and i had a few cool guys help me.. &#039;<br /><br /><br />So good luck guys, and becareful where u spend ur BTC.. AND DO NOT FE!!! Iv got almost 80purchases NOT A 1 WAS FE! Swear to God!

				WARNING: Do not buy from Dr. Holland. This vendor is a complete scam. I was ripped off $600. Message after message, emails, etc. I get no response. He uses lotteries to boost his ratings and robs people every chance he gets, following through with a couple small transactions then probably writes his own ratings with a fake account. Obviously i&#039;m not the only incident, and it is UNBELIEVABLE to me that SR still allows this asshole to sell product. Integrity of the entire marketplace depends on the oversight of SR administrators and they also have failed to respond. For reasons like this markets like Atlantis will eventually lead to the end of the road for SR..

				Has anyone actually reported this vendor or is this just a bitching thread? Report him using your SR account.

				Wow I&#039;m brand new here and this is exactly what I&#039;m scared about. Sorry for your loss guys and thanks for letting us newbs know about this. Some people are asking to FE early because I&#039;m brand new and have no feedback or whatever. Idk what else I can do other than post here to get a name for myself. I don&#039;t want to FE with these people and then get ripped off. these prices are pretty high if u ask me! I really hope it&#039;s superior product. but it sounds like some people on here are con artists. damn.
