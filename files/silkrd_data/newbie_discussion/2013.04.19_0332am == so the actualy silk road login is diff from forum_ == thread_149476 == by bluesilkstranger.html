				1.&nbsp; No, you create a new account on Silk Road, you can use whatever name and password you wish<br /><br />2.&nbsp; The pin you choose is 4 numbers, like 1234<br /><br />3,&nbsp; I have no idea to be honest except it may have to do with stopping the spammers that were dropping thermonuclear bombs of copy and paste garbage post&#039;s to scam sites where they steal your money.&nbsp; <br />Moderator&#039;s couldn&#039;t really keep up because they just used a bot to make hundreds of accounts and flooded each sub-forum with threads that all said the exact same thing, link to their scam site (scam = offering to sell you bitcoin for paypal).&nbsp; If you need 50 post&#039;s to access the rest of the forum&#039;s it stops these bots.&nbsp; Could be wrong, I was never subject to the new 50 post rule, but have noticed when it started all the spam stopped.&nbsp; So if that&#039;s why, please never ever ever remove this rule lol.&nbsp; If you&#039;re new ... suck it up, cuz trust me, it was getting overwhelming with the # of spam threads

Damn that makes me feel old for some reason...), the PIN was not limited to 4 chars and could have numbers AND letters, which makes it MUCH more secure than just 4 numbers. Seeing as how this can stop someone from getting at your money even if they gain your username and password, I think it&#039;s fairly important. <br /><br />Yes, it was partly due to the spam, but it also concentrated all the noob posts into one area instead of having 20 &quot;what are bitcoins?&quot; posts and the like spread out all over the entire forum. <br /><br />If you have any questions, you can PM me.

				Yes, that&#039;s the way it is with 99% of most sites that have a separate forum, if the site &amp; the forum aren&#039;t all in the same webpage, you&#039;ll usually have to create two separate account for the separate websites. <br />&amp; the 50 post count is to stop (help stop) scammers/spammers/etc.<br /><br />&amp; there is no &quot;lower upper number combo&quot; that I know of, you can choose any random 4-digit+ number as your pin when you first create your SR account, it&#039;s how you verify orders, you may have entered it when you first created your account &amp; forgot.

				1.&nbsp; Since no one&#039;s told him ... silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />2.&nbsp; When I joined pin wasn&#039;t even used for anything (16-18 months ago), they they smartly instituted it&#039;s requirement in withdrawing/depositing, etc.&nbsp; I recall when they did this there were a dozen threads of people asking what there pin is and how to get it back because when they forgot it because when they signed up it was an irrelevant password, whose purpose i&#039;m not really even sure was.&nbsp; I was mistaken though yes, I thought it was a 4 digit numerical pin, I was unaware it could be longer, sorry<br /><br />2b.&nbsp; Who leaves BTC in their SR account unless they&#039;re depositing it here to make an imminent purchase or a buyer has finalized and released the funds from escrow?&nbsp; SR can AND HAS gone down from short periods of time up to 2 weeks.&nbsp; I&#039;m not risking my BTC becoming inaccessible, which is why my bitcoins are in an encrypted wallet on physical media (a USB stick).&nbsp; <br /><br />Even now when I go to make a purchase or make a withdrawl, my BTCs only ever see SR for maybe an hour if i&#039;m buying, and up to a day ... however long it is until I get off work and check SR if a buyer has finalized a purchase from me.&nbsp; If I wanted to I could just have those finalized funds automatically sent to an address if I wished.<br /><br />So i&#039;ve no plan&#039;s on going to change my 4 digit pin&#039;s, I can only see my pin being relevant if SR staff need&#039;s to verify my identity or something, but there were definitely a lot of ppl tweaking out when they had to actually start using their PINs and had forgotten them and had to wait 7 days to access their accounts, because they like myself considered it completely irrelevant when I signed up on Silk Road, the feature of needing your pin to withdraw funds simply never existed until just a few months ago.&nbsp; Luckily I remembered my important pin, had to wait 7 day&#039;s for my other account (buyer and seller account)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Yeah I was just making a stab in the dark about the 50+ post thing, all I knew was I started seeing a hundred pointless threads pop up all of a sudden with people just making blank post&#039;s and that&#039;s when I learned they had implemented this new 50 post to access the rest of the forums rule.<br /><br />Just trying to help the guy out :/
