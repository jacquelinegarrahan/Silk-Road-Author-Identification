				So there are lots of things i&#039;ve come across since discovering the SR and i&#039;m ready to dive in but i do have some questions. ive done literally hundreds of hours of reading and settings up a secure computer and all sorts of other kinds of prep work but there are still questions i have that may have been answered and slipped my mind or i havent found an answer to yet.<br /><br />1) Can i access the tails persistent volume offline and write to it? for example, id like to download a wallet generator, there are numerous avail but im talking about one&#039;s like the blockchain one. the blockchain one will let me save the webpage for offline wallet generation but my pc in normal Vista mode is far from unnetworked secure pc. i dont have the option of using another pc so i figure booting Tails, which is a &quot;fresh os&quot;, unnetworked, generate my wallets, and reboot. i understand there is a small risk of a supervirus carrying over from windows, piggybacking on some BIOS filesystem or some such crazy shit but the chances are slim enough at this point, ive taken significant measures to clean up after myself since beginning this journey. But anyway in order to do that requires me to access the wallet generator offline but i need to get online to get it using 1 computer...<br /><br />2) I read an article on the SR sub-reddit from and post guy about &quot;streamlining&quot; our mail through the USPS system but when i asked my mail guuy about it the only advice he could give me was adding the 4 digit code to the back of my address. Simple enough and that was included in the article but there&#039;s more. the guy was talking about doing a form online and &quot;minimizing the number of employess who come into contact with said package&quot;. I stay pretty current on the Reddit forums, watching and reading, learning from other people mistakes and such. Over the last 2 months or so ive discovered some really cool stuff on the SR sub-reddit but i dont always bookmark the juicy stuff. Or some times i dont realize how juicy the information actually is until after the fact, such is the case here.<br /><br />3) Does anyone have a priority list of things for first timer? (Buyer) A broken down check list of things that MUST be done. this can vary depending on the user and their needs but certain things are a staple for example<br /><br />learn about Tor, BTC, and PGP (Tails is helpful once you understand)<br />Find the SR (google is NOT your friend)<br />Create and Account (DONT FUCKING LOSE YOUR PASSWORD OR PIN!!!)<br />Research Vendors (Some require a certain amount of activity such as purchase history, forum membership length and post count, not just your order history and &quot;star&quot; rating or wtfever)<br />Become active in the community and show your not some pos LE snake in the grass<br />Shop for price&#039;s and a vendor that grabs your eye<br />Acquire BTC<br />&nbsp;<br />there&#039;s a lot to it if you wanna use it as intended, maturely and responsibly. any teenager can download Tor and go to town in an hour but at least for me this is the fruition of 2-3months of WORK. Shits consuming me, prison is NO BUENO<br /><br />4) Also it&#039;s late as fuck and im tired and have work in the morning so i have a lot more to add and ask but who&#039;s got the best LSD period?? i&#039;ve read some really good things about the ying-yangs and the blue dolphins.... i used to dose 5 Mad Hatter&#039;s no prob, im looking to get launcehd into space, i want the ceiling melting down on top of me, walls breathings, painting with my trails kinda visuals. ive eaten 1000 mushrooms, im good on the body fry. i love it dont misunderstand but i want a really strong visual trip for a change.<br /><br />Ill be back on tomorrow to put a dent in this 50 post restriction, hopefully ill have some replies :D

				1. The streamlining of USPS mail guy was probably talking about using the POSTNET system&#039;s barcodes on address labels. I&#039;m 95% sure that&#039;s what you/he are talking about. see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSTNET<br />2. Learn PGP. Might just keep you out of prison/trouble and/or totally off LE&#039;s radar.<br />3. Connect to a VPN/VPS, then the tor network. don&#039;t connect directly to tor if you can help it.<br /><br />
