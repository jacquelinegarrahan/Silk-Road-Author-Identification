				guys im sick of seeing everyone on the discussion board&#039;s of vendor&#039;s telling us to NEVER FE (if you don;t want to be scammed...) and then seeing people with reputable stats that are spending massive amounts of $$$ on the order and they are FE&#039;ing.. Then proceeding to being ripped off..... Im new here and can see it was obviously different a while ago. But can someone please clarify, Is there ANYONE that sell&#039;s decent coke/MDMA at a decent price, That ships to AUS without having to FE???? <br /><br />IF NOT, Can someone explain why all these reputable vendor&#039;s are telling us international customer&#039;s NOT TO FE EVER..... When we clearly have to? Im so fucking confused... And would love to stay in escrow for my order&#039;s... Surely they still get the cash if they prove they sent it? ARGH, Ok any help would be great

So guy&#039;s since that was NO help and apparently its my fault for not voting..., would someone with like half a brain please answer me. Ive asked many aus buyer&#039;s what they&#039;re success rate is, And often they haven&#039;t EVER lost a package, Some say 1 in a few hundred... So is there any good vendor&#039;s that do let you stay in escrow untill you can prove you never recieved it? or whatever...

				Clearly the enlightened is quite dim,&nbsp; there are vendors who will ship to us without FEing&nbsp; but the problem remains that there are scammers in this country.<br /><br />Some vendors will allow you to stay in escrow if you choose the tracked shipping, as I always msg a vendor before placing a order I ask them if they would be willing to allow me to stay in escrow(doesnt hurt to ask) as for those specific drugs I cant comment but if I can get H in escrow you should be able to get coke or mdma

				If your SR buyer stats are decent and you send a message to the vendor first, they will probably be happy with escrow. Maybe give that a go 8)
