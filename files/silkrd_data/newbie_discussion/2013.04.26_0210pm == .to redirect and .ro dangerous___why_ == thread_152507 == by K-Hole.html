				I seen that someone said I typed a ONION.TO or &quot;.TO&quot; web-page and that they are dangerous?!?!?!!? I am really nervous now, how are they dangerous and why? I am new to this and if it reveals your IP address does it reveal your &quot;real&quot; IP addy or just your TOR IP addy? Which could be fixed by exiting Tor and restating which would give you a new IP addy plus a &quot;Masked&quot; IP address? I am just wondering why they are dangerous, what risk have put myself in? And is the hidden wiki dangerous, fake, or something that should NOT be visited or only pages that that re-director that is a green page pop-up and you have to click the link to be forwarded. Also I thought if you clicked &quot;New Identity&quot; or restarted Tor your IP addy changes again? So why is it so bad that they have your &quot;Tor Ip addy&quot; since it changes so frequently and it is a Tor Node IP addy not your actual &quot;real&quot; IP addy or is it? I thought Tor browser would not work if it did not go through the bootstrapping and the &quot;Congratulations your browser is configured to use Tor&quot; I thought that gave you a new &quot;masked&quot;/&quot;Appears as&quot; IP plus another IP that is of the Tor node you connected though? So is it good to exit TOR completely and restart to get a new IP completely instead of just a new&nbsp; &quot;appears as&quot; or &quot;masked IP addy&quot; when your true TOR IP could still be seen ? Plus even if seen who cares and why? I mean if it goes through<br />several dozen network node computers and the IP is indeed fake what can reveal about someone or is it showing my real home addy IP address? I am scared now, I thought if using Tor anything and everything that goes through the Tor browser shows up as a tor node IP and IP addy which does NOT reveal you but a fake IP addy? what does the onion.to or .TO do? reveal your actual IP through Tor or just your Tor IP addy?<br /><br />Please let me know the above and why .TO&#039;s are dangerous and if the Hidden wiki is dangerous for the sites that do NOT redirect you through that green .TO page? If it NOT to is it safe?<br /><br />This is all very serious and def not spam!

				The one time I used .to to get to the SR forums, I realized afterwards that my alias and my posts were listed on google on the non-tor web. Just to play it safe, I changed my alias.
