				In my opinion, if a vendor sends out 10 packages of useless bullshit, and then reships everyone the right product at half quantity, he&#039;s scamming.&nbsp; I mean come&#039; on, at the prices I and 9 others paid for a bunk product recently, a certain heroin vendor will clear at least a grand in cash if he only reships half of the product originally ordered.&nbsp; I know he could of told us all to fuck off, and half is better than nothing, but it&#039;s still a form of scamming in my opinion.&nbsp; He had to have known his product quality before sending it out.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I call it scamming.&nbsp; Maybe he didn&#039;t know it was as shitty as it was but he had to have known it wasn&#039;t his usual A+.&nbsp; So, knowing there would be complaints and reorder requests and planning to resend half of the quantity purchased, IS SIMPLY PREMEDITATED SCAMMING.&nbsp; He knows people will give him a good rating and praise his integrity for making it right, all the while, he&#039;s packing back stacks of cash and building an army of advocates willing to have his back anytime he need&#039;s it going forward. <br /><br />Maybe some of you guys are happy your getting half your order, and sure I&#039;m glad to get half rather than nothing, but I&#039;m paying top dollar and taking highly consequential risks.&nbsp; I expect what I pay for.&nbsp; I&#039;m out a bunch of money and look like a dumb ass to a bunch of people who were willing to make substantial investments if said product was good.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I&#039;m completely off on this vendors original intentions and plans.&nbsp; But whatever his original intentions or plans were, don&#039;t really matter.&nbsp; It&#039;s his current intention and plan that effects me the most.&nbsp; I was sent bunk shit and am out 200 bucks.&nbsp; It&#039;s real simple, give me the entirety of my money or the entirety of my order.&nbsp; None of this half bullshit, I don&#039;t put half of the funds in escrow.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give me half of what I paid for.&nbsp; Make it right, or fuck off and find a different job.<br /><br />Ohh, and whats my recourse here?&nbsp; Is this something I can dispute with SR staff and possibly get my full refund.&nbsp; This vendor has already admitted to having sent people a shit batch.&nbsp; So then, short of a full refund or full reshipment, wouldn&#039;t SR have my back?&nbsp; What do you guys think?

				Its way to easy to scam here i mean you really cant tell who is who and all you need to do is rope people in start selling a G here a G there then 3 Gs 5Gs and if you have a good product you should have a good amount a business built up and after a while you just disappear its sad but it happens<br /><br />best bet is dont get into one supplier for too much spread it out over sellers

				I&#039;m not saying he is or is not trying to scam people. Just remember that every story has two sides. <br /><br />If the vendor admits it was a shit batch, think how much of a loss that was? Perhaps the vendor really would give you a full refund but because of their own loss, they are unable to do full refunds and still remain in business. Unfortunately, there are times when even the best of us has to do something in a way they would rather not.. They admit they made a mistake and did their best and what they could to rectify it. That deserves something more than negativity.

It&#039;s good that you didn&#039;t post this during a rash moment. I&#039;ve come to believe that reacting from anger or annoyance can just make things that much worse. I personally try to make all my decisions while in a good mood (Then again, I am one of those truly happy individuals that rarely had a bad day, gets angry, etc)<br /><br />My favorite saying, &quot;People will be people&quot; fits in this discussion. You&#039;re 100% right. People are devious and greedy and there will always be those that wish to make others life experience shit. It&#039;s unfortunate, but life is unfortunate at times.

				If you are saying that this has happened before with this vendor and other buyers have had the same experience than I would tend to lean towards the belief that after the very first time the vendor should have taken some step(s) to make sure that he was not sending out a shit product for a 2nd, 3rd time...etc. Maybe DPR and staff might want to watch this vendor for future instances such as this. If it keeps happening I would tend to lean towards the opinion of a scam. Just MHO. Best of luck.<br />&nbsp;???
