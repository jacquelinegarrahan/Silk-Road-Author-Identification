				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m strongly considering loaning money through the Silk Road.<br /><br />What is the protocol if I don&#039;t ever receive payment back from the borrower?<br /><br />ManOfBliss

				The protocol is crying yourself to sleep. I&#039;ve made the mistake of lending money here before, only to be disappointed and $300 poorer. Save yourself the trouble and the money and just buy your drugs instead.

				Don&#039;t loan money, ever.<br /><br />If someone needs a bit cent, I usually say to just pay it forward.

				how would you collect if they dont pay you back? and any info they give you can easily be fake and you have no leverage anyway .sounds like a very bad idea

				Anything under .3 btcs is ok in my book. I had to borrow once or twice because I was short just a little bit. I paid each person back double.

				As was previously mentioned...you can&#039;t really do a damn thing if they don&#039;t pay you back.<br />This is an anonymous marketplace. You have no collateral and no way to go after them.<br />All you can do is tell people in the forum they scammed you, which, if they aren&#039;t using their real account (who would..?) it won&#039;t matter at all.

				Yeah like everybody else is saying loaning money or really doing anything outside of escrow on the road is a good way to lose money. Just out of curiosity is if Jesus of Rave&#039;s investment for cheaper mdma you are considering?

				There&#039;s a BTC loan site on clearnet called btcjam.com that you might want to look at. I think they have quite a high default rate though...

				I&#039;ll lend up to 0.1, maybe 0.2 if it&#039;s someone I&#039;ve dealt with before. No possible way to get it back otherwise, so I&#039;m not risking more than I can afford to lose.
