				Hi Everyone! NEWB vendor here and have just opened shop. I&#039;ve gotten some interest in my product but I would like to check the buyer&#039;s stats of some of the people who have sent me messages but cannot seem to do so from only receiving a message from these people. Does anyone know if there is a way to do so or does a buyer actually have to place an order for me to be able to see their stats? I&#039;m sure its probably been discussed but I can&#039;t seem to find an answer in the forums. Any help would be appreciated!<br /><br />Also, like I said, I have just opened up shop. If anyone is interested in my prod check us out. We don&#039;t have a lot on here yet but will get there. Check us out at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/91bd298d3e <br /><br />&nbsp; 8)

				im not a vendor and i could be totally wrong but my assumption would be that u have to receive an order.&nbsp; otherwise u could just go lookup anyones stats at anytime, and i think that is a bit too much authority to be giving a &quot;vendor&quot;...&nbsp; IMO vendors only need be looking at the stats of potential customers who you have ALREADY received an order from

				thcaddict<br /><br />Thanks! I was actually thinking the same thing but was wondering because one of the messages I recieved was asking for free product for a buyer with &quot;really good stats&quot; so I trying to see what these &quot;really good stats&quot; were from this person. But I think you are right because I don&#039;t seem to be able to do so. I did reply to this buyer and informed him that I would definitely be sending some freebies with orders, at least while we are in our &quot;start up&quot; phase. I am assuming the free product he was asking for would be in addition to an order anyways.... or are there some vendors who just plainly give out freebies? I would imagine that there needs to be an order in place for someone to give us feedback/reviews right?<br />Thanks for the help!&nbsp; ;)

				From my understanding a seller can only see a buyers stats once an order has been placed.

				Is a seller able to see previous transactions from the buyer?<br /><br />ie. Bob bought lollipops from Joe for 2 BTC
