				Ive noticed, darkexpresso has had two public PGP encryption keys, yet he has taken them down, for what reason I dont know, since PGP is free, also Ive notice very little feedback on his fourum and his vendor page... so why I ask is it so hard to make a PGP key? It seems to me that there is something funny up with darkexpresso...can anyone shed any light on this?

				Somebody else has to notice this! Ive been a long time Road Traveler, and its like everyone doesnt seem to notice, would you actually order that kind of weight with out PGP? I have to know where did all his repeat customers go? its like EVERYONE stopped posting in his review thread....

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend ordering if there is no key available man. Sure you&#039;ll more than likely be just fine but it&#039;s not worth the risk!! It only takes one time to mess everything up. Not even Privnote bro

				Thanks for the advise man, I cant do it, especially with the amount of weight hes pushing.. I have been keeping track of the people on the fourums who have claimed they have received recently, and the ones with &quot;missing or lost orders from him... ( making sure they have been logging in daily) but my skeptical mind wonders to the furthest of conclusions..Like some of the customers have had CD&#039;s and LE has obtained their user name and password.... reason for these skeptical conclusions is because some people were saying how inconvenient that their order said delivered and never received, and its like all the sudden they all just drop the subject like loosing over a LB is no big deal, yet they continue to log in on the daily.... NOTE** this is pure speculation from the most skeptical mind, so this shall not be taken as slander by any means..<br /><br /><br />SurfinSilly

				Whats up with the single letter replies?&nbsp; I&#039;m just here to provide some insight, for any potential bulk buyers...<br /><br />NOTE*** I have purchased of darkexpresso before, and it was a smooth.. but this all happened a few weeks afterwards, I like to keep tabs on my vendors, I cant get myself to buy from random vendors, I call it self preservation.<br /><br />Thanks to the people who actually responded<br /><br />SurfinSilly

				Whats up with noone having any weed for sale?????????? I can&#039;t just order from some noob vendor that I never ordered with before. Im done with all that bs. This is our life these guys are messing with and I can&#039;t trust these people that don&#039;t know how to ship. If I was a vendor you guys would see how packing should be done. This is not meant to Darkexpresso at all. All my normal vendors either have no bud up for sale or no active listings at all. WTF is going on?

				The only vendor up right now, that I can hopefully trust is BAYAREABUDZ,&nbsp; Ive read great reviews on his forums, but my main people, sourdiesel (gone) , humboltsfinest (soldout), lucymcgee (soldout) , Hearofhumbold (pricey by my standards but has held a great rep for quality nugs) and thats about it...&nbsp; every other vendor Ive been watching has either disappeared or has not been able to keep up with demand, I&#039;m really frustrated at this point, however I will be eternally grateful for SR as a whole... NOTE** there are a few other quality vendors that Ive never scouted out such as greenovendoor, farmer1, puffbuddy, WestcoastRx (although there is speculation of interception from him)&nbsp; and a few otheres, but yes it seems the weight is dry.... Ive kept my eye out for weedindeed, but his come and go style doesnt float my boat...cheers to the fellow buyers in the same boat as me! <br /><br /><br />SurfinSIlly

				surfingsilly1,<br />&nbsp;Im in the same boat as you with the problem of finding a good vendor for weight... I VERY recently tried out BayAreaBuds, and was more than satisfied. My only option as far as I was concerned, and he came through like a champ. Cant and wont say everyone will have the experience I had, just know I was satisfied. Good stealth, quick ship, and dank as dank is dank.

				If you guys start receiving sprayed product or product that isn&#039;t what is advertised, please please please use the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on the vendor&#039;s profile.
