				How to use ANY TYPE of Oxycontin:<br /><br />1) Scrape off the waxxy / crappy coating as best you can. If they&#039;re the NAPP OC ones just wet your thumb and index finger and hold the pill between them for 30 seconds or so and then carefully scratch off the edges first. then hopefully you should be able to almost peel off the top and bottom. If it&#039;s the oxylan ones then just put it/them in small cup of warm water for 10-20 seconds then rub them on something cotton (and clean). repeat until it&#039;s pretty much gone,<br /><br />2) GRIND THEM UP!&nbsp; I&#039;ll explain in a different thread the difference between OC and OP later but I really mean GRIND THEM UP AS FINE AS POSSIBLE.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I use a pestle and mortar and go mental at them lol!<br /><br />NOTE: If you do a lazy job of grinding them then, because of how they&#039;re designed, you&#039;ll end up with the full amount, but continuous release still!!! (well... almost hehe)<br /><br /><br />Anyone wants ANY info about Oxycodone and please feel free to PM me at any time.<br />

				Ive been experimenting with it lately. Whats better; snorting or eating them? I,ve read conflicting advice on this some people say snarf them, others say eating is better and longer lasting. Also whats a good dose for someone with little or no tolerance? I just crushed up a 20 mg and ate it. Starting to feel a little high, would snorting another 20 mg be ok? I have lots of experience with most types of drugs, I&#039;m just new to opiods.

				I ate 20mg, waited an hour then decided to snort another 20. Feel pretty good now. I find I get pretty itchy when i have oxycontin, and its always my bollocks that are the most itchy area! I think that these oxys are my new weapon of choice, however I think it&#039;s wise not to get high on them too frequently.

I&#039;m a big fan of eating drugs myself, it&#039;s plain better for your body overall. Plug it or make a nasal spray if you must, but snorting all those binders can&#039;t be good for your poor nose blood vessels. I started at 30mg of oxycodone (orally) for my first recreational opiate experience and felt overwhelmed and vomited more than a few times. I would think that 20mg on a full stomach (fatty foods help) would be plenty for your first time.

				If you&#039;re totally new then snort 10-20mg of oxynorm or VERY well crushed up oxycontin (see previous post)/<br />Your tolerance will soon build if you use for more than 3 days in a row without a good 4-7day break.

				As said earlier, tolerance builds really quickly to opiates. I took no opiates during the last 9 months except for 2 days for a medical procedure and I still didn&#039;t reclaim that &quot;magic&quot; of my first opiate experience. Another combination to avoid is benzodiazepines and opiates.

				The best solution to tolerance maintenance without WD&#039;s is Kratom. I&#039;ve been burning Kratom everyday for a few years and the magic maintains. Just avoid extracts. Kratom is also great for actually wd&#039;s. Since Kratom is not actually opiate (could&#039;ve fooled me) when I take real opiates it&#039;s still pretty great.

				My understanding is that bio-availability is far better oral than insufflated (snorted).&nbsp; Don&#039;t start snorting just because you think you should.&nbsp; Start with taking it orally and get a feel for it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there is much risk with a 15mg oral dose of Oxycontin for opioid naive, but to be safe, start at 7.5mg and work up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once you think you really understand the drug, try snorting and form your own opinion.&nbsp; You may be surprised!&nbsp; I enjoy snorting good drugs but never snort OC - always oral.<br /><br />I could handle 30mg oxycontin IR very quickly and then more.&nbsp; That is the &#039;charm&#039; of the opioids ha.&nbsp; Everyone is different so don&#039;t start at 30mg if you have no tolerance.<br /><br />Oxycontin is much more expensive than decent heroin #4 but there is a toll when you put things in your nose over and over again.&nbsp; I wish I could get a heroin high orally instead of nasally.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regardless of the opioid, aim to take a break after two consecutive days, three max.&nbsp; That&#039;s no joke.&nbsp; 3+ days in a row and you will begin to get a mild taste of withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Stay smart.

Though I have to say, nothing wrong with snorting your first OC, oral oxynorm for sure, but it&#039;s the rush you&#039;re after, not the general feeling right? in which case, you gotta plug or snort or it won&#039;t work. It&#039;s slow continuous (contin) release.<br /><br />Nothing above is wrong, I just reckon you&#039;re after the rush, and if you are, insufflation is your friend. As he said they, start slow, you can always take more, you can&#039;t take less once you&#039;ve done it!

				^ This is why there is a 50 post restriction to the forums. Useless information. <br /><br />How did you do oxy the first time? Would you do it the same way if your knew what you know now?<br /><br />Eating them is good. Snorting is good if prepped properly. Smoking them is stupid, shooting them is even worse.<br /><br />If you are resorting to smoking or shooting just get some heroin. You will get there eventually, might as well save yourself some time and money.<br /><br />Fentanyl, that is a drug to smoke. What else are you going to do with the gel leftover from wearing a patch? Shooting it is stupid. <br /><br />I digress, eat and smoke. Eat 20mgs as a foundation for the evening, them crush and snort the rest incrementally until you get to where you want to be and then stay there.

If you did try again, try 5-10mg.<br /><br />Also, I assume you weren&#039;t drinking as well?<br /><br />Of course you could be allergic to morphine?

Wait an hour or so, if you&#039;re not feeling much, then take another 10mg. First time I took Oxyocodone I took 10mg and I was nodding my face off. This stuff is pretty potent, don&#039;t be fooled by other peoples&#039; tolerances.

If you were to shoot it dosages wouldn&#039;t be far off your insufflation dosage, maybe 70%. but seriously, there&#039;s no real need with oxycodone. Still, I&#039;m certainly not denying there&#039;s be a bigger rush!

				I cannot recommend Ballervison enough. Place your order before 9:30pm EST and it goes out an hour later, with a tracking number sent to you an hour after that. I don&#039;t want to get into his location or shipping methods, but lets just say 2 days from West Coast to East Coast, and some of the best stealth shipping I&#039;ve ever seen.
