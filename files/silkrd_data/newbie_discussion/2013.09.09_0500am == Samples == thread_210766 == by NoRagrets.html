				Hey guys, I&#039;m a reputable buyer on the SR and was wondering if anyone had any samples they wanted to part with. I&#039;ll leave a 5/5 review for you and write a review post in the newbie thread. Let me know! (PM me for my SR username)

				Dude, everybody wants free drugs so why would they chose someone with as much as 5 posts ? I think you&#039;ve got to prove yourself first and show that you&#039;re a contributing member to the community. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not trying to be a douche but all I&#039;m saying is I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be very successful if you ask for samples this way. <br /><br />Try to get in contact with your vendors if you buy regularly from them and they still need&nbsp; a review on the forums maybe you can work something out.

And try to get to 50 posts so you can reply to any sample offers that come up. Sometimes samples will be posted on the SR main site too, but they sell out fast.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not common for vendors to seek out individual buyers for samples unless you have a relationship with them.

				You&#039;ve got to get more of a name for yourself on the forums first. Post more, write up reviews on products you&#039;ve bought, and try to get on the reliable reviewers list (if it&#039;s still being updated).
