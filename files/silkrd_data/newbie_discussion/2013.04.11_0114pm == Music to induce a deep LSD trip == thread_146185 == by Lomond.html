				Hello. <br />Tonight I am going to try my biggest dose of LSD to date, 600ug. I have already chosen my soundtrack for the evening, a selection of classical, mainly Bach. I would like you lovely acid heads out there to tell me what is your favourite music to trip to, and if a certain genre has had a profound effect on your experience. For those who are interested, I shall write a trip report this weekend. Peace. <br /><br />Lomond.

				I find that I can&#039;t pre-select music before a trip, but rather I have to find what feels right in the moment/for that trip. As a musician, and lover of music, finding music that feels right is so so so important! <br />Also, good monitors and a properly treated room really help you to enjoy the experience.<br /><br /><br />I once listened to Bon Iver&#039;s &quot;Bon Iver&quot; album whilst tripping (a far reach from your classical mentions) and had what I consider to be the best music listening experience of my life. Every instrument and every element of each song sounded perfectly crafted, played by angels to create ultimate sonic bliss. The experience was so profound that I can not bear to listen to Bon Iver anymore. It just doesn&#039;t feel right to listen to it. I&#039;ve tried listening to it again whilst tripping but still, it does not produce the desired effect. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t consider Bon Iver to be genius musicians or &#039;cutting edge&#039; - but my point is that it was right for the moment.<br /><br />TLDR; Choose carefully, but choose what feels right in the moment.<br /><br />P.S If you are so inclined as to consider listening to Bon Iver (tripping or not), I would recommend anybody listen to &quot;Minnesota, WI&quot; - from the aforementioned album. Such energy in that song!

				Really depends on the situation but usually classical music or some beats antique treats me right. Shpongle is the shit too, seen them live tripping dick a couple of times. Great experience.

				check out FOUR TET.&nbsp; its somewhat easy listining with intense soundscapes.<br />early albums like rounds and pause. his sound goes deep under my skin on tryptamines.<br /><br />HANS ZIMMER - OST for INCEPTION is great, too. fantastic sounddesign, I like that one on ketamine best.<br /><br />seriously, on 600mcg I dont know if I wanted to listen to music. it might be somewhat&nbsp; on the verge of overwhelming although I can take a lot. :)<br /><br />enjoy your journey mate.

				Classical is definitely nice... I listened to Mahler&#039;s 5th Symphony on acid before.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely against psychedelic musi c, but I don&#039;t enjoy it while tripping at all.&nbsp; Jazz can be awesome too -- some nice relaxed, more modern jazz instrumentals can be really nice.&nbsp; You also couldn&#039;t go wrong with some older jazz like Miles or Coltrane.

				Steve Reich occupies a nice spot between Bach and jazz, with a hint of psychedelia. It&#039;s very bright and positive too.<br /><br />His &quot;Octet&quot; might be worth a go...<br /><br />I usually prefer more abstract electronic stuff, but will try Reich next time...

				Cliche but, I usually just put on some Acid Jazz veryyy quietly. It fills the room/area, but doesn&#039;t get you so focused on the music so you can enjoy the trip to the fullest imo

				I highly recommend listening to music on LSD. When I trip I absolutely love the sounds of The Doors, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, and of course Hendrix.

				<br />I can only speak for myself. <br /><br />On my first LSD trip, I listened to Radiohead&#039;s House of Cards and saw the music video. ( http://vimeo.com/2037463 )<br />It was dark, and depressing. I was overwhelmed by the experience.<br /><br />On my second LSD trip, I listened to some Psychedelic Goa Trance genre of music and focused inward.<br />Had a great trip this tip, full of insights that I could absorb and integrate.<br /><br />

				Chopin&#039;s nocturnes will get be really deep and have me crying in a good way. I&#039;ve found classical music to be very healing on psychedelics. I also, dig Gershwin and Barber. Samuel Barber&#039;s Adagio for strings is epic as well as Agnus dei which is the choral arrangement of adagio for strings very beautiful music to accompany or induce ego death. Good jazz is good on the come down for acid I have found. Like Dizzy Gillespie, Wes Montgomery, Benny Goodman-- all that bop and hard bop keeps my spirits lifted. <br /><br />My most recent trip on some bridgessi I listened to Massive Attacks album mezzanine and really digged that. i don&#039;t know if I would recommend it for acid though as its a little darker and acid has much more of a dark head space for me than mescaline. And trip hop isn&#039;t everyone&#039;s cup of tea in general.<br /><br />I also enjoy modern classical minimalist composers such as Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Brian Eno. Here&#039;s some good 8track playlists for that:<br /><br />http://8tracks.com/mrraymond/who-s-afraid-of-the-avant-garde<br />http://8tracks.com/mrraymond/further-adventures-in-minimalism-redux<br />http://8tracks.com/aworks/aworks--the-american-minimalists<br /><br />Have fun tripping!
