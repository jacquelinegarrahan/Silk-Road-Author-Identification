				trying to setup an &quot;anonymous&quot; email but im a bit new to all of this craziness. I&#039;m not technically inept or anything, but i&#039;m more used to face to face business. anyway, for having conversations with people i meet thru the SR, is hushmail safe? i set up a tormail account, but their site said you had to use thunderbird and i&#039;d rather just do everything through the tor browser which erases all my history when i close it.<br /><br />not trying to have anyone hold my hand, but a finger pointed in the right direction is what i need.

				Hushmail is not safe.&nbsp; They have rolled over on steroid dealers in the past and this indicates to me that they will roll over on anyone.<br /><br />You can access Tormail through the Tor browser bundle.&nbsp; There is no reason to use Thunderbird.

				Hushmail had much to do with the fall of the &quot;Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; ... Now that little 20 year old nerd from Secaucus, NJ is taking it in the butt. Hope it was worth the 100k he made that year. <br /><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://www.northjersey.com/news/Secaucus_man_among_15_arrested_in_international_online_drug_probe_.html&nbsp; &lt;--- Oops!

				I don&#039;t trust tormail to stay around forever (already had to switch domains once). Safe-Mail, hushmail, and other services are fine as long as you ALWAYS connect to them anonymously and ALWAYS use encryption.

Hushmail are a KNOWN honey-pot. <br />Tormail, as far as we all know, is not. The domain change is actually an example of that. <br /><br />Tormail has been attacked, like SR, several times by the governments of the world and still, they remain the #1 anonymous email service.<br /><br />Hushmail has not, because they openly give logged email over to Federal Agencies, Foreign Governments, etc. as mentioned in SEVERAL reports on the Farmer&#039;s Market bust last year.<br /><br />And are you serious? To quote you &quot;unless quantum computing magically happens&quot; ....<br /><br />To quote reality: &quot;The first working, commercial quantum computer was created by DWave Systems, a firm based in Vancouver, Canada. Its first sale, in May 2011, was to the defence company Lockheed Martin, which has links with the NSA.&quot;<br /><br />Good luck with that hushmail.
