				Thanks for this posting. This is a good lesson for anyone using a fake name going to their home address. I would say this is why he got nailed.<br /><br />From the article: &quot;They each contained 50 ecstasy tablets and were labelled with the false name &#039;Mr S Coombes&#039;, the court heard.&quot;

				Yes.&nbsp; First impression it might seem like a good idea, but from reading this I realised that, if anything, you&#039;re digging yourself in a hole.&nbsp; You can&#039;t say &quot;someone&#039;s sending it to me to get it in for me&quot;, and if anything it&#039;s only going to raise suspicion.&nbsp; The police are going to start thinking &quot;Why is someone sending drugs to this address when no one here lives by that name? Is someone trying to cover something up here?&quot;. <br /><br />I guess if you are going to use an alias, there needs to be a story behind it so you can give a plausible explanation to the police, rather than a random name.

				I dont know the laws in the UK, but I would think if he denied it and refused a search that the prosecuter might have given him the benefit of the doubt based on his service record.

				Honestly I suspect he HAS been treated leniently.&nbsp; In the UK you can get 7-15 years for supplying Class A drugs (I may be mistaken on this) and there are a lot of determining factors.&nbsp; For example, if you are just a petty street dealer, or selling it to your mates then you&#039;re going to get a much less severe sentence than a regional distributor.&nbsp; I suppose because he&#039;s selling it online, and potentially in bulk from the sounds of it with the amount of substance that he had at the time, the police would consider it as a widespread operation.&nbsp; Sentencing can depend on if it&#039;s a first time offence, social circumstances, and I&#039;d imagine what the actual substance is.&nbsp; I assume if he was selling heroin and not ecstasy he&#039;d be far more severely punished.&nbsp; From what I gather from the article, from the judges statement, the fact that he&#039;d been using it as a coping mechanism during his service, and from that it had somehow warped into him selling it, was taken into consideration in their judgement.

				wow that&#039;s harsh. 139 pills and about an ounce of the stuff is obviously an amount that will draw a dealing charge, but in the grand scheme of things isn&#039;t really that much.<br />

However it&#039;s always a great opportunity to look at the situation and discover where he went wrong (ie fake name) to help aid your future decision making. More than likely he got flagged because of suspicious behavior that had he researched further would have maybe kept him out of trouble.

				I was thinking of buying some Supermen from the Netherlands.<br /><br />This has made me rethink.<br /><br />Any NL vendors out there who have sent 3 shipments and the Customer is suddenly offline? Or recognise the drop name?

				There is no evidence this is due to a fake name. Names are not really checked in the UK for delivery, unlike America (or so I have heard).<br /><br />Perhaps due to poor NL stealth? Sheer bad luck with package profiling?

And even if their suspicion is, frankly, unreasonable courts back the police up. But before we go there pills being sent to an address is certainly suspicious. The UK is not the US in such matters, I&#039;m afraid.<br /><br />Certainly if you&#039;re going to import hard drugs it seems to make sense to (a) keep TOR on a stick (b) hide that memory stick off-site between deliveries (c) ensure there is nothing else dodgy on your PC (hardcore porn, torrents, anything) (d) clean house of all gear between deliveries.<br /><br />If he had denied they were for him, if they searched his house and found nothing, and if he maintained blanket ignorance he&#039;d have had a fighting chance... because there would have been no evidence to link him to any crime.<br />
