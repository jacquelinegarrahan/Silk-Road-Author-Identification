				Because if SR were to ever get taken into the wrong hands whoever goes through the site would be able to see all the names and addresses sent through the system. With PGP you ensure that the vendor is the only one able to decrypt and have them. Once your package is sent vendors are supposed to get rid of all addresses as well

				Yes you do. And if you want to risk having your address possibly available to the wrong people then don&#039;t use PGP. Honestly though, it&#039;s super easy to learn, took me like 10 minutes. And some vendors will only accept addresses through PGP, so that&#039;s another reason to learn

If SR is hacked or information leaked before it is deleted, then your sensitive info might get released.

				Hi xir8r,<br /><br />When you as a buyer enter a shipping address for an order, you enter it onto SR itself, and it is picked up/sent to the vendor. IF you put it in plain text, and SR was hacked or otherwise compromised, your shipping address, clearly legible, could be harvested. IF it is PGP encrypted with the vendor&#039;s public key, all that could be harvested is a meaningless jumble of encrypted code. It cannot be decrypted without the vendor&#039;s private key, which is known only to them, not to SR.<br /><br />Your shipping address is the one thing that can link your real life to an order on SR. Given that most of what we all order on SR is illegal in many jurisdictions, do you want to take even the remotest chance that that link could be made? <br /><br />I&#039;ll answer that for you - NO!<br /><br />Search for the threads on PGP tutorials, and use PGP. A little practice and you will get it. Keep yourself safe, please, please, please. Use PGP.
