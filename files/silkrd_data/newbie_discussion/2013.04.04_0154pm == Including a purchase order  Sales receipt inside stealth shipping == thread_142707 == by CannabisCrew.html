				Any advantages to generating a fake purchase order and including that in with your stealth product? Has anyone received anything off SR that ever included a packing slip or any fake receipt whatsoever?<br /><br />As a seller, I&#039;m wondering if I should be doing this to further protect my customers while adding an extra layer of security.

				*bump*<br /><br />Any other inputs on this? Is it better, worse or not even worth the trouble? I figure if the vacuum sealed bag is exposed from improper handling whoever suspects illicit materials would poke around and see a sales order / packing slip and figure its probably something legit. I mean as long as the person doing this can&#039;t blatantly see what the contents are they may just move on and let it be.<br /><br />Has anybody here ever received an SR order that contained a packing slip? I personally have not but am trying to figure out if its worth the trouble.

				I have, from several vendors in a variety of formats and I think it&#039;s a great idea. It&#039;s certainly better than wrapping the contents with blank paper which in my opinion raises suspicion... If the product is disguised as something else along with a PO to show it I don&#039;t see any reason for LE to actually open the sealed packet (unless there is something else suspicious about it).

Doing the same with a packing slip or purchase order would probably look off as well. <br /><br />Thanks for the reply. I will start incorporating this into my shipping process!

				always a good idea to make packaging as close to the rest of all the other packaging going thru the mail!
