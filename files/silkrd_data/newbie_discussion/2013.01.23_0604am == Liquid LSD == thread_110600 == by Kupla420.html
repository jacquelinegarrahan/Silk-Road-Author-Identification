				What is your main concern for stealth? Parents, Relatives, Loved ones? As lsd or the like are not usually the things being checked for with dogs, plus domestic to domestic is good to go a high percentage of time. If you search the forums for LSD Avengers you will find a thread dedicated by honest reviewers who know what they are talking about and have a list of names of vendors they highly recommend.<br /><br />I do not know if he does cross border, you could ask him.

				Personal concern and for my family that lives with me. I mean I already figured out a way that I can&#039;t get arrested even if they know the stuff is in my residence. If they were to arrest me it would be found as an arrest on no grounds so I would get set free. But even though I know I have no worries on getting arrested, I still don&#039;t want my family to go through that whole scene and I don&#039;t want to have to not come on here anymore cause I have huge plans for where I want to go with this. My friend and I are teaming up to buy on here. He&#039;s the one looking for the liquid LSD. For me I&#039;m looking to get a bulk stock of Ecstasy. Not sure which kind yet cause I need to review vendors for the best deals and ratings. <br /><br />The good thing is that my friend usually has his place to himself and my family doesn&#039;t dare touch my mail cause they know I&#039;d flip shit. It also helps that absolutely no one knows how we&#039;re getting the things we are. So we&#039;re trying to find our 2 products to find a good vendor we can trust and stick with so things stay as simple as possible.

				Ok so I will steer you in the right direction, anything different is your choice but these two options would be a great starting point for your business.<br /><br />First off for MDMA, you need to look no further. for here is <br /><br />Lucky Lucianno<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a773f1b769<br />He is known around the forums to have the best mdma on the market and lucky for you only sells in bulk listings. An OZ would equal out to 32 dollars or so per gram. I&#039;d say he&#039;s your best bet. And yes does international shipping and has great stats<br /><br />As for liquid LSD <br />I steer you towards the Avengers thread on these forums. Look at their star rated sellers, pick one who suits your fancy and see what they have.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Have a nice evening.

				Thanks! That&#039;s much appreciated. I&#039;m sure that will help a lot in getting started. The biggest snag I&#039;m having right now is trying to figure out this whole encryption mess. Also my friend who referred me to this site told me how he got his bitcoins and said it&#039;s the best way but it sounded complicated as all hell so hopefully it goes smoother than I&#039;m imagining.

				It is a bit daunting at first but you will come around and it will seem like a walk in the park. I youtubed some very good step by step PGP processes and that was how I learned. As for depositing money, it&#039;s different everywhere you go. I have a pretty easy system here, try to find a site that allows you to do cash at branch without having an account, I did this for the first few times and it worked smoothly. You can also do the prepaid cards from 7/11 among other stores and transfer through a vendor on SR.

				The way my friend said he did it (if I can remember correctly) was that he did a mail order money exchange or some shit and he got a receipt from that and then he talked to someone on here, gave them the number on the receipt and then the money was on his account. Something like that I don&#039;t know. Just sounds like a hassle.

				I really hope so cause my buddy and I really want to get into this for the long run. It&#039;ll be a lot easier once I have my own place out in Cali hopefully within the next 5 months. At first I was extremely freaked out cause I was like shit I&#039;m gonna end up getting arrested but now I&#039;m chill as hell with this cause I figured out the perfect plan to not be allowed to be arrested even if they pull a surprise CD. There&#039;s no way it can fail.

Before you purchase anything from the Silk Road i suggest you extensively research the 2 things you are getting caught up on.<br />1-PGP encryption is your number 1 priority. Learn how to do it and have a good understanding of what is actually going on. There are plenty of threads in the security section to help you out<br />2-Depositing cash for BTC is a rather simple easy and anonymous procedure. I suggest using a local cash deposit website in&nbsp; your area. Again, the forums are your friend with this. Head over to the security section and read read read. <br /><br />For your safety and everybody else&#039;s around you just research everything until you feel proficient in doing it.<br /><br />Good luck&nbsp; 8)

				Check vendor JOR. Become a fan, then keep checking for vials. If you order small amounts they will come on sugar cubes or something else. PLUR has JOR liquid, but not aure how he ships it.
