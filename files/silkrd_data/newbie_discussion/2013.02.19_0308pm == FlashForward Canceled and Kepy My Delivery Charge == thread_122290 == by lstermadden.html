				So my first transaction worked out great last week with deluxedelivery, good product, good delivery. last night i placed an order with flashforward for 2 of those .2 bags, that plus the .33 BTC delivery charge came to 5.00 BTC. that left me with .34 btc left. this morning I woke up and a messege in my inbox said that flashforward canceled the order... which sucks because I was expecting it to ship today, but then i look up and it says I only have 4.99 BTC... Wow.. now I can&#039;t even make a 5.00 BTC order... where did my .33 delivery charge go? did flashforward just jack me for it? gr :( i already sent a messege to SR and I will see how it unfolds.

				it&#039;s more likely the SR transaction fee which doesn&#039;t get refunded if the vendor cancels unfortunately.

				No, he didn&#039;t &quot;jack&quot; you for anything.&nbsp; He probably has escrow hedging activated, which is why a small fee was kept.&nbsp; (the vendor doesn&#039;t get the fee, by the way, it goes to SR.)

				Well, it tells you when you add something to your cart whether or not it is hedged.&nbsp; So if you want to avoid vendors who use escrow hedging, it&#039;s easy to find out when you add an item to your cart.<br /><br />

				southpaw, was that english XD <br />I previously explained, when I DID read, i STILL didn&#039;t find out what happened to my money.<br /><br />and correct me if im wrong, but if the SELLER CANCELS a transaction, shouldnt the SELLER be responsible for paying the FEE to post on silk road? why am I penalized for him canceling the transaction?

				I have a vendor account myself, &amp; therefore I know from my own firsthand experience that the vendor who cancelled the order (FlashForward in this instance, apparently) didn&#039;t screw you over or profit off the order of yours that they cancelled in any way. When a vendor cancels an order, there&#039;s absolutely no way in which they could take any of the money that you paid them for the order even if they wanted to. It all goes into escrow, &amp; all is supposed to go back into the buyers account when an order is cancelled. It sounds like this is an issue you should take up with someone representing the Silk Road, since I&#039;m 99.9 per cent certain that whatever error occured that caused you to lose bitcoins was SR&#039;s fault, &amp; the only party that may have received those Bitcoins of yours is the Silk Road themselves in some capacity or another.

				luxxiaxx is correct.&nbsp; the vendor did not profit from this in any way.<br /><br />however, this loss was not the result of an error -- as previously stated, it was the result of escrow hedging.<br /><br />i&#039;d encourage you to read the Buyer&#039;s Guide on SR before placing any more orders.&nbsp; the Buyer&#039;s Guide specifically explains escrow hedging:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Silk Road Buyer&#039;s Guide</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Escrow hedge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the Bitcoin exchange rate isn&#039;t as stable as we would all like it to be, and can fluctuate wildly in a matter of hours, let alone the days or weeks it takes for a package to arrive. Because of this, there is a real danger that the Bitcoins being held in your escrow account will lose value by the time your vendor gets paid or you are refunded. So, we&#039;ve given the option to vendors to hedge the future payments they are expecting from escrow such that the dollar value of the payment doesn&#039;t change as the Bitcoin exchange rate changes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; For example, a seller is hedging the escrow for a 10 btc order you place with them, and the dollar value of your order when you purchase it is $100. Now, let&#039;s say your order never arrives and your vendor agrees to a full refund, but those 10 btc are no longer worth $100, they&#039;re worth $50! Because your vendor hedged the escrow, you won&#039;t get a refund of 10 btc, you&#039;ll get 20 btc equaling the original value of $100. Of course, the opposite is also true. If Bitcoins appreciate in value while your order is in escrow, your refund will be fewer Bitcoins, but still equaling the original dollar value.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When checking out, you will see which orders will be hedged and which won&#039;t. After the order is placed, your escrow balance will reflect the dollar value of your hedged orders and the Bitcoin value of your unhedged orders. All hedged orders are hedged as soon as the order is placed. So when getting a refund for hedged items, don&#039;t be surprised if the number of Bitcoins you get back is not the same as the amount you paid.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you need the most up-to-date USD/BTC exchange rate, we recommend mtgoxlive.com.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
