				&nbsp;So I can no longer access my old road account at alllllll. i know i didnt change my password and i had great buyer rating and 100s of successful buys. anyway, as i make a new account i go to view my btc address and instead of showing it, it says click here to make a deposit which ive never seen before, so i click it and it sends me to a page&nbsp; stating:<br /><br />Warning: Read this before making a deposit to your account<br /><br />Your PIN is required to make purchases, withdraw funds from your account, and make important changes to your account. If you forget your PIN, or give it away to a phishing site impersonating Silk Road, any funds you deposit to your account will be irretreivable.<br /><br />Before depositing any funds, you should change your PIN and password on your SETTINGS page. If you are unable to change them because you&#039;ve already forgotten them, you must create a new account and try again.<br /><br />Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:<br />&nbsp;then it shows my btc address but nowhere to click to change my address...<br />A friend of mine thats also on the road doesnt have that on his account and said it doesnt look right at all so im REALLY curious about finding out whether this is something new for new sr users or something before i go load money on my accoun t

				This was addressed in one of DPR posts recently ( i think entitled &quot;A few small changes&quot;) <br /><br />That page was put in place to remind new people who haven&#039;t deposited yet or people who haven&#039;t deposited in ages, to change their pin/password before ordering.<br /><br />Once you deposit to that address, you wont see that page and it will be the old style page where you can click and get a new deposit address.<br /><br />I freaked when i saw that as well, but after made my first deposit I now have the option to get a new wallet address. Just look up DPR posts and its in the thread somewhere<br /><br />
