				I know this is the Newbie only discussion but I am a experience buyer and seller on the Road, just new to the forums.<br /><br />Anyway, I placed an order with redrain on Jan 13th for his listing to exchange moneypak for bitcoins. I knew ahead of time that releasing the moneypak code before I got the bitcoins was at risk of me being scammed but I was stuck with a moneypak anyways. The last messaged I received from him was from 9 days ago and since then, I&#039;ve sent him 3 messages, all which he read and still no response. I should note however that he never &quot;cancelled&quot; the order, it is still &quot;processing&quot;. <br /><br />Anybody else have any problems with redrain?
