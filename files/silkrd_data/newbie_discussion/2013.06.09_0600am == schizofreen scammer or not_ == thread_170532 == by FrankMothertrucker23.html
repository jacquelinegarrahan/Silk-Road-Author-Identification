				He had a rough patch a couple months back but after my order was finalized and a month had passed he came back and made good on my order. He is really trust worthy and everything seems to be back on track.

				I have ordered from Schizofreen in the past. Top notch quality and great customer service. One time order was late and we did the refund process. Then a few days later I receive the package before I could add funds to re-order! Of course I PM&#039;d him right away and sent him the refund back. My last order was probably a year ago but only because I&#039;ve been focusing on other purchases here but when I order again it will definitely be with him and with tracking.
