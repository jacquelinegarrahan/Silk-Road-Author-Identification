				I own my own businesses with 30 employees and it seems that I could get my packages at work very easily. If I put PERSONAL on my mailing address then there&#039;s zero chance of it being opened. Thoughts?

				There is always a risk. Do you get a lot of personal mail to this address? Would the letters blend in with the rest of the stuff that comes in?

				THe package itself wouldn&#039;t stand out - we get plenty of mail.

				If you don&#039;t own the business, DON&#039;T receive illegal packages there. What will happen when cops show up to &quot;ask a few questions&quot; about suspicious package? That&#039;s right, your ass gets fired, AND you go to jail. Don&#039;t risk your income at least.

				Seems like it would work to me. Just make SURE your employees are separating personal from business. I would try ordering something from ebay or amazon and see how they open it or not.

				I have a similar situation and would only do this if I had a vendor I could trust to communicate shipping details. Then you could be around when the mail is delivered to ensure no chance of accidental opening. The other concern for me is the legality difference of a home delivery versus my company in event of an intercepted package. If they were to do a controlled delivery does your business get shut down now while you fight whether the package is yours? With a home bust possibly my wife may be able to continue the business? I need to look into this more.

				This is a really difficult situation. How much do you trust your office manager? Would they say anything if they found drugs in a package?<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d get a post office box, at least then it&#039;s only ever between you, your dealer, the postal service and potentially the law. Your children and employees can never be accidentally involved.

				@miker914<br /><br />That is the salient point - a great point. Yeah that wouldn&#039;t look very good at all in the papers : )<br /><br />Hadn&#039;t even thought of that angle.

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t like the idea of having an SR package sent to work but I guess it depends on the order and the people you work with. Some packages carry very little risk so sending them most places won&#039;t be suspicious. However personally I can never come to terms with possibly putting other people at risk in order for me to get some drugs, who knows who all would go down at your work if the package is discovered and a large amount.
