				Hello folks in the next few months I want to become a SR vendor, I know that this is not for everyone and does not happen overnight. I got into distribution several years ago, and had known about SR then but thought the whole idea of selling drugs over the internet is very farfetched. After spending countless hours here on the silk road forums, my favorite being philosophy,economy, and justice I feel that I am beginning the knowledge pool i have always desired.<br /><br />I have made my second order via SR the beginning of this month the first being successful but i also sent to where i live. As i did no research about shipping especially spending just a few minutes in the shipping forum to learn what should be fundamental here. I knew not to shit where i eat but i understand this philosophy better know, with the sharing of knowledge this community provides. <br /><br />My desire to become a SR vendor is now fired inside me because i have moved to a new area to take care of someone, and I do not want to get involved with the risk of meeting new people locally and doing street level business. <br /><br />I understand that i know nothing and have the whole world to learn from, and this SR community is a great place to start, I love all the knowledge provided here, there are some really great people here. If any of you veterans ever loose faith in the next generation, which me being one I have lost faith in it, understand that your philosophy and ability to not be a dick and share your knowledge and perspective with no fear of judgement or criticism is what brought me to make this thread. If that is not good enough for you give me a few years i&#039;m working on it :)<br />&nbsp;I dont know any of you but what few people i have read many posts from i love you already, thank you SR community let my mind become open<br /><br />hoping to one day change the world not by wanting it to change but by actually fucking doing something<br />-da bears 4ever 8)

				Anyone have any advice for me, specifically would like advice from vendors who obviously done the same thing i am aspiring to do, become a vendor on the notorious SR. if anyone gives a shit to chime in, what are some things you wish you did differently ie fucked up in, and eventually learned from .<br /><br />Even if i go through every thread in every forum here i know i will not know enough to 100% foolproof in the black vendor

				I would suggest that you learn from being a buyer.&nbsp; Make small purchases from a number of vendors who now sell what you want to offer.&nbsp; Make notes about their communications, shipping methods and speed, stealth methods, etc.&nbsp; Read the vendors&#039; home pages.&nbsp; Get an idea of how you want to present your self and what will be your terms of service.&nbsp; Learn PGP. Your first priority is the privacy and safety of your buyers.

				I would do lots of things before selling, start shipping real things to people first without showing your face.<br />Look for a return address. Get bulk supplies of bags or what ever you will need, From a place where you don&#039;t use a credit card or your face.<br />Just think things thew, read some more on the forums. Like how to ship what your selling ect. ect.<br />Wish i could tell you more but somethings you will need to find on your own, Good luck sir.
