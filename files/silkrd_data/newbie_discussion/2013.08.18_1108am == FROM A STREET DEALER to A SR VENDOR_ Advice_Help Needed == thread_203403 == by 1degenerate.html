				Hi all:<br /><br />I am trying to learn all of this anonymity stuff really quickly and it seems to be very overwhelming to me.&nbsp; While I know more than just the basics when it comes to computers, how to keep myself out of LEO&#039;s arms seems like a daunting task.&nbsp; I have been advertising my &quot;wares&quot; on another website, doing F2F sales in my area and I feel as though I have been rather lucky to not have gotten &quot;pinched&quot;, and I get the feeling it&#039;s only a matter of time that I am. I understand that this is part of the game I am in and nothing is 100% safe but, meeting total strangers on a public website is INSANE. Thankfully, it has only been a month that I have been selling there and I have a decent customer base built up but, not enough to handle my supply of a VERY HIGH IN DEMAND pain medication. I have decided to go &#039;underground&#039; on that site no longer taking on new customers. I always knew about Silk Road for years and never needed it until now. So here I am trying to learn all about this new way of doing business and, at the same time run my business safely and efficiently. Added to that was my complete IGNORANCE regarding BitCoins, which I believe I have a decent understanding of its concept. I now need to understand all of the nuances in order to maximize my profit margins.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason for my post is I would like some feedback from anyone that is very knowledgeable about the topics mentioned.&nbsp; I would be most grateful if a successful seller would &quot;show me the ropes&quot; but, I&#039;m not holding my breath.&nbsp; Then again, I could be wrong about how helpful sellers are with other sellers and if they look out for each other.&nbsp; I would think it would be in their best interests to do so. I would not have a problem compensating a well known and trusted member/seller of Silk Road to act as a consultant and get me up and running as fast as possible.&nbsp; I apologize in advance if this post is in the wrong place, or if my proposal is not appropriate or allowed.&nbsp; I am not looking to break anyone&#039;s record of being banned in the shortest amount of time. (I am a former BL member and the mods never booted me so....)<br /><br />I thank you all in advance for any help provided and look forward to any replies,<br /><br /><br />1degenerate<br />
