				I am new to SR and am lost! I have been left some bit coins from a fellow member who is sadly no longer with us.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;( I now would like to send some of the coins to Mt. Gox to sell, then re-buy when they&#039;re worth a little more, then send back into SR wallet to purchase with. How do I do this?!? I know this is 101 stuff to you guys and ladies, but I am confused and need to understand this method. And last, what is the best method of cashing out from SR when I take profits?

				In regards to the question asked at the end of your post,<br /><br />First of all, when you start making money (well, technically Bitcoins) through being a vendor on SR, you should definitely do whatever you can to avoid ending up in a position where you have thousands &amp; thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins that you need to cash out. This is something that seems to happen to a lot of different vendors, &amp; unless you&#039;re willing to be very patient &amp; cash out gradually, it seems to be very hard - if not impossible - to cash out thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins safely. <br /><br />The method of cashing out that I would recommend would be through a vendor on SR who offers services such as sending cash in the mail or via Western Union/Moneygram in exchange for your Bitcoins. You can find vendors who are willing to do this in the &quot;Money&quot; section of listings on the Silk Road. <br />It&#039;s incredibly important that you use a vendor that&#039;s been on SR for quite a while &amp; has at the VERY least 150 prior transactions on the Road. Also, it&#039;s obviously definitely important that the person is well-reviewed &amp; that others have had very beneficial experiences with cashing out with them. However, being someone myself who offers that service, I know firsthand that it means having to deal with lots of extra-difficult customers &amp; that many people get accused of scamming in the feedback people leave them even when the vendor has indisputable proof that they sent the money that they were supposed to.
