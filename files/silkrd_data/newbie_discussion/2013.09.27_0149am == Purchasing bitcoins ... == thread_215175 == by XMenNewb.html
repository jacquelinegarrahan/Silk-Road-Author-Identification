				Is purchasing bitcoins with your credit or debit card with tor as your browser safe? Is it a good idea to use paypal?<br /><br />I would like to purchase bitcoins so I can make a purchase, but I am not sure if just going about on tor is safe enough. Can anyone fill me in on this?

				Dude, they are bitcoins. Bitcoin is not illegal to buy. I use localbitcoins.com and do cash deposits at Chase. It&#039;s easy. Sure you have to give up some information about yourself, but honestly, it doesn&#039;t matter..

				Bitcoins are definetely legal to own. I have used bitcoins for legal uses and bought them many ways, but it seems I have never seen a place that accepts paypal? I have seen a place that accepts credit card for a huge surcharge. If you want to remain anonymous you could always buy in person... refer to the poster above.

				Alright. Sorry, but I still have questions arising in my head. If I make a local purchase do I provide the address that I find in my SR account?

				I&#039;m under the impression that you can go somewhere locally and purchase bitcoins with cash and have them sent to your wallet (my SR wallet/account)<br /><br />Sorry, this whole thing is rather confusing for me. I have even read the the wiki page already. Perhaps I am over thinking things.

				Keep reading... your safety should not be rushed. <br /><br />Go to localbitcoins.com and read, you&#039;ll understand after.<br /><br />With that site you can obtain coin by meeting someone in person, or by bank deposit.&nbsp; The coin will then be deposited in your account on that site which you then transfer to SR.

				xmen, if you search &quot; silk road access&quot; through the TOR browser there you will find several topics on silk road with helpful directions and instructions in various ways of explaining how the whole thing works. You need to see the big picture of it all. No shame in not grasping it right away. Like Yoda says&quot; take your time and stay safe&quot;. I took a couple of weeks before I moved into it. If you are using bitcoins for silk road you definitely want to stay anonymous when purchasing them if at all possible. Anonymous should be your goal in all that you do from email address all the way to the end. <br />
