				Been around SR for a while now and I was wondering who has the best service in each section, I&#039;m almost always willing to pay the premium for the best of the best so no worries on cheaping out.

				Great Thread, all about your PURPOSE to identify the Best Vendor for each product&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />That&#039;s EXACTLY what brought us here.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />For years one of the Elves was on a downward slide of addiction and could not see any way out.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Long story short was that he ended up having a massive breakdown due to far too much legal highs and a busy home / work life.&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />He did give up all drugs but was never the same person (He still had extreme urges to take uppers each weekend), he searched and searched online for answers to what might get him back to being &quot;normal&quot; again - reading this and that, trying hebal medicines, hypnosis and meditation all to no avail....&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />During his research he stumbled across Terence McKenna and DMT. He was completely hooked on reading about this unbelievable substance and one fateful day around 4 years ago he made the decision that DMT was in fact a medicine rather than a drug and justified trying it.<br /><br />Just ONE breakthrough on this substance changed his life FOREVER!<br /><br />He no longer craves ANY drug and sees the world through the eyes of a child elf once more.&nbsp; He got his mojo back in spades and has never looked back since 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />The Elves then decided to start extracting DMT full time, trying all the various TEK&#039;s they could find online, most of which produced excellent DMT, but they noticed the very distinct difference (and effects) that temperature made to the types of alkaloids which were extracted.<br /><br />We found that room temperature Online Tek&#039;s were always the best and decided to try to experiment with negative temperatures during different the different stages of the STB extraction process.<br /><br />Within the last year we believe that we have optimized our process, to produce the most potent NN-DMT available.<br /><br />THE MACHINE ELVES PURPOSE IS TO BE THE MOST RELIABLE PURVEYORS OF POTENT DMT ON SILK ROAD.<br />WE HAVE A SINCERE WISH TO HELP OTHER BEINGS WHO ARE HAVING THEIR OWN ADDICTION / MENTAL CHALLENGES.<br /><br />That is why we joined; to share the medicine that is NN-DMT and to be the best / most favorite / helpful vendor on SR.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br /><br />************<br /><br />Main Listing: 250mg NN-DMT * High POTENCY - Trusted UK Seller *<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7f87868c0d&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />A few of our Stealth Listings (inc Pictures)&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2eee9b641b<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9fdf36e70e<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5ce84c5715<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ed192b3b04<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d30d7863ab

				charas hash - ReD EyE <br /><br />NBOMe - bomesweetbome<br /><br />fishscale coke - meerkovo, lloydsbrothers have consistently good gear but a shade expensive and there&#039;s some triple acetone washed stuff that zakswan listed a few days ago I&#039;m absolutely dying to try here&nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/033d9967fb<br /><br />cannabis/concentrates - Quality Kings have some 1st class concentrates, they have weed listed too but not tried it personally. Not bought much weed off the road as the standard/price is decent where I am. <br /><br />

				Great info thanks for the advice, although I don&#039;t mind vendors promoting themselves customer feedback is the best promotion you could possibly have.
