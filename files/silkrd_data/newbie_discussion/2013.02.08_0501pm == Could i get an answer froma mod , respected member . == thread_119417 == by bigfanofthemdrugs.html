				Earlier in the week I made a domestic order for something that is still illegal but not as bad as drugs.<br />After being in transit a few days the vendor messaged me saying he forgot to put stamps on my box can i give address again, with no other info.<br />I messaged him about this question but no reply.<br />I want to know what happened with the box with no stamps ? Would it have been returned to sender ? Is there a box of illegal things just kickin about the postal service with my name on it and no stamps ?<br />I think/hope the box was returned to him as I&#039;m not sure how he would know otherwise and I don&#039;t think the item is illegal where he is.<br /><br />Please some input I will burn the drop if I can&#039;t find out / guarantee that it was returned to him<br /><br />just sucks

				Well, there can be various outcomes.<br />The package does get sent, and you have to pay the porto/postage. Or they (Mail people) can be a total ass and return it to sender.<br />If they return it to sender, it depends on what address he put on the package. Some vendors tend to impersonate a company or such an entity.<br /><br />In the event that it would be returned to sender and they would open it... Who has the time and wants to be involved in an drugs investigation? It will most likely be discarded/trashed.<br /><br />At least, this is what I think that happens, to the best of my knowledge.

				Sounds sketchy.&nbsp; A vendor &quot;forgetting&quot; to put stamps on a package?&nbsp; Either some kind of ripoff or just a very, VERY careless vendor.&nbsp; Not sure what to tell you, but you might try just asking for a full refund and then placing an order with a different vendor.
