				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3490c0dd7b<br /><br />Anyone have any experience of this vendor?&nbsp; I see he was doing some 1g &quot;Cheese&quot; freebies last week but I was too late and missed out.&nbsp; His prices seem a little steep for the Cheese but the generic homegrown seems a lot more reasonable.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				TheHerbalist sent me a sample of both strains.&nbsp; Arrived within 24 hours and packaging was excellent.&nbsp; This was my first Silk Road experience and my main worry was whether the postman would be able to guess what was inside the envelope.&nbsp; My worries were unfounded as the contents were expertly packaged in such a way that no smell permeated the envelope.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to try the weed but the quality of both looks fantastic.&nbsp; I thought the Homegrown may be slightly less than average (due to the cheap price) but it looks great, covered in crystals.<br /><br />My first SR experience couldn&#039;t have gone smoother and I will definitely be placing a paid order with these guys soon.&nbsp; If only the Bitcoin wasn&#039;t so bloody volatile!

				Their cheap bud is exactly that, you can get it on the street, frosty and dry but weird smell, not cured. The cheese is lovely and good price for uk. Hanuman is also good but i,d recommened Terpene,s Exo Cheese (he,s putting some up soon, give him a pm) evcellent vendor, next day delivery and bud has been cured, this guy knows how to grow&nbsp; ;)

				Herbalist has always smashed it for me, he sends same or next day, his standard green food bud is for the UK really good value and a decent enough smoke. It&#039;s not like the cheese, he sent me some of that too and that is banging quite expensive but banging. He&#039;s reliable and he vac pacs and his packaging is decent, just depends what you want and how much you have to spend really. <br /><br />I can&#039;t remember the vendors name but whoever it is that sells the Hindu Kush, that was fucking tasty as well. Proper crystally a little bit brittle but tasted good.

				The herbalist can fuck around with orders sitting in processing for days sometimes it,s next day, just depends&nbsp; :-\ Apart from Terpene and DoctorNoname, i,ve also had recent orders in UK from Greenlights,the bakery, pharma boy, Walterwhite and Hanunman. International, Whiteshark who has great weed at a good price (Canadian) and Dutchmagic 5x1g sample strains, all lovely. All these vendors have been great&nbsp; ;)
