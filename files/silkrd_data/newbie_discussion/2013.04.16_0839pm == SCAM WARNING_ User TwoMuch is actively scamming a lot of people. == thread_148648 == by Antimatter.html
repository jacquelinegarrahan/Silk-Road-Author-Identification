				Enough said. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH HIM! He offers bitcoins for MoneyPaks but then cancels the order immediately after withdrawing the funds.<br /><br />I gained a lot of trust for this method because SugarMama always came through and was reliable, but this time I didn&#039;t want to wait a few days and TwoMuch&#039;s quickness in replying tricked me. I just lost a bunch of money and am furious. It hurts so much when you lose this much.

				Yep, there&#039;s been a few threads about this guy already. Moneypaks are scams waiting to happen. Make sure you check the forums before you decide to do business with a new vendor.

				I had the same thing happen to me back in December from a vendor named Pills4Less.&nbsp; He got me for $500 and I found out through the forums that he got like 3 other people for about $2000 total.&nbsp; Now, I only use Sugar Mama.&nbsp; I think the longest she has taken is about 2.5 days.&nbsp; The last transaction I did with her was about 24 hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to wait a day or two and use someone reputable than it is to get scammed.&nbsp; The was one other guy that I used a long time ago that was also very good, DrGonzo, but I don&#039;t know if he is still in business.&nbsp;

				This must be about the 20th time I have said it - moneypak for bitcoin shouldn&#039;t be allowed at all. In addition, anyone that does moneypak for bitcoin and gets ripped off has no basis for complaint. As othedamnthing says, &quot;moneypaks are scams waiting to happen&quot;.

				Nanpa,<br /><br />You think we don&#039;t the risk when we jump into it? Of course I am aware of the risks and how easy it is to get ripped off, and I am not complaining about the nature of the system. I simply wanted to warn others so they don&#039;t get scammed. If anything, you can argue I deserved this for not using SugarMama.

				Hey Antimatter, I also wanted to add one more tidbit of advice for you which you may want to think about.&nbsp; When deciding whether or not to use a new vendor, the first thing I always do now is come over to the forums and look to see if the vendor has any feedback over here.&nbsp; I also go through their feedback on their SR vendor page and look at the quality of the feedback that they have.&nbsp; Most of the feedback is very succinct, but there are usually a fair number of people that go out of their way to leave a nice long review.&nbsp; If you spot someone that you think may be suspicious and all of their feedback consists of &quot;Great job&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or &quot;A+&quot; or something which seems to be very minimal, then there is a possibility that they have faked the feedback by setting up $0.00 dollar transactions (like bitcoin transactions) and leaving themselves 5/5 feedback just to pump up their stats so that they can eventually run a larger scam.&nbsp; Obviously this is not a fool proof method by any means but I figured I would throw it out there as one more thing for you to think about when evaluating a vendor.&nbsp; When I was brand new to SR I figured that a 100 feedback score automatically meant that they were top notch.&nbsp; I am not sure but maybe the SR management has put some more sophisticated rules in place in the software so that it helps prevent people from faking feedback in that way.&nbsp; Take care bud.&nbsp; RJ.&nbsp;

				We don&#039;t even have these things in Canada or atleast I&#039;ve never seen them. Is it like a prepaid visa or something?
