				It&#039;s a big idea, infosharing thru massive amounts of letters sent straight to peoples homeadresses..<br /><br />The info media will not talk about could be delivered thru a letter to peoples homes and it would be very posetive if the governments or media was about to do something evil towards the people like start a war or something then a simple letter for peace would probably make a big change since people would not fight any wars if they got a letter telling them the truth about the wars instead of listening to the media promoting wars.<br /><br />*free-energy inventions<br />*cure for diseases<br />*warn about vaccines or dangerous perscription drugs<br />*inform people about warplans<br />*end a war<br />*world peace<br />*expose a psycopath politician<br />*expose a industry makin money from peoples diseases<br />*expose the media for lying to the people<br /><br /><br />The list can go on forever and I personally feel that when bitcoins and SR is used for infosharing then people would have the power since none would be able to lie if the people can just pay for letters to be sent until all homes in a country got a letter telling them the truth and how to support the truthsharing by paying some more to get more letters sent.<br /><br />The only thing the vendor needs is a cathegory on SR for infosharing and a list of all adresses in a country or a town so letters aint sent to the same home twice.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to the people to do it and start caring about eachothers enough to pay for some truths to be sent to other fellow humans.<br /><br />What&#039;s youre opinion?<br /><br />Peace!

				I should write that in my country the government did a massvaccination campaign while the experts said it&#039;s not nessecary and dangerous..<br /><br />Alot of people got hurt from the vaccines and it changed their lifes for the worse and many of the victims will now fall asleep if they try to laugh or gets exited. Since the vaccines contain mercury and other addatives the victims had no idea was in the vaccines.<br /><br />And all because the government wanted to give taxpayers money to the vaccinemanufacturers.<br /><br />i know alot of people would had payed to get letters sent out, warning people about them vaccinesaddatives.<br /><br />What do you think?

				Problem is......even if you accomplished this and had deeply important, world-saving information, no one would pay any attention. We have something similar now in the homes of nearly everyone in the developed world at least: the internet. People still believe everything they see on TV.

				Unfortunately the people that would most need exposure to the truth don&#039;t want it.<br />People tend to gravitate toward what they know or already believe.<br />In the US, even the cable news networks are just echo chambers for the people watching so they can hear their own ideas and values shouted back at them. It makes people feel good.<br /><br />And even though we like to believe that some things are the truth, a lot of times we find out later that we were wrong.<br /><br />Interesting idea however.

				Thats exactly the problem if you ask me, there is a huge wall between the internet people and the tv-watchers and when the internet people gets clever enough and find a way to share the truths from the internet with the tv-watchers, then there will be changes.<br /><br />I think we to dumb for it tho and this will probably just be a dream of mine. =(<br /><br />Atleast we can sedate ourselves with drugs before we let them kill us.<br /><br />To bad we cant send any info to the tv-watchers =(<br /><br />i wish there was a way like a anonymous way to pay and send info to eachothers without having the need for dumbass tv-watchers to learn the internet before they knows anything about the society they live in and the &quot;people&quot; they gave the powers to by voting on the demoncrazy, I mean democracy.

When my fellow Americans ask what cable news network I watch, hoping to figure out where I am on the political spectrum, I just have to laugh incredulously. Though I really want to cry tears of rage at such a sad state of affairs.

				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />I say bitcoins and SR could create world peace if we just did this since none would go to wars if every home in a country got the same letter about peace then I doubt them would pick up a gun for the governments..<br /><br />Peace and love is easy when the &quot;ball starts rolling&quot;, creating wars tho thats kinda difficult, they have to orchistrate a fakeattack or something to get people into &quot;defending&quot; by invading type of stuff hahahaa wars are really dumbed down but as long as the propagandabox is going and the politicians say that it is in the peoples best interest to kill others.<br /><br />
