				Title: <strong>Consequences</strong><br />

				So I&#039;m looking to make my first purchase off of SR and I am curious about one thing. I&#039;ve done my research and picked my vendor; I&#039;m looking to pick up about 1/4th of mj.<br /><br />I have it narrowed down to two vendors. Both ship domestically and have ratings of 100. Their names are XXXotica and TheBudFather. <br /><br />My question is this: If my package were to be caught in transit, what is the worst that could happen to me? I&#039;m assuming that the package will just be confiscated and I won&#039;t hear anything else about it. Is there anything worse?<br /><br />Also, who has the better shipping. XXXotica or TheBudFather? Thanks!

				Dno about whos got better shipping, I dont buy pot on SR..but i can tell you that at 7g, it will be taken, and disposed of, youll receive what we like to call a Love Letter, from the customs or usps, stating some BS, just ignore and change drops, or chill for a while. <br /><br />

				But my vendor is domestic, so it wouldn&#039;t have touched customs at all. Aren&#039;t love letters only sent by customs?

				The worst that would happen is you&#039;d have to tell the cops that you didn&#039;t order anything and you lose your weed. They won&#039;t get a warrant for a quarter so all you&#039;d have to do is keep your mouth shut. They know just as well as you how SR works and you don&#039;t know shit about the vendor, so they won&#039;t get a warrant on those grounds either. You&#039;re fine for small amounts like that but if you get caught you have to change your shipping address and name. Write &#039;Return To Sender&#039; on package and let it sit overnight if you&#039;re paranoid. Don&#039;t even open your door for them and don&#039;t sign for ANYTHING. Deny deny deny deny.

				I&#039;ve actually found a vendor who uses MBBs (CannabisCrew). Can anybody comment on the use of MBB vs. vacuum?

				mbb is better than vacuum sealing because it isn&#039;t permeable and odor doesn&#039;t seep through so long as it is packed right. i can confirm both thebudfather and xxxotica use mbb.. and you should feel safe ordering from either of them.
