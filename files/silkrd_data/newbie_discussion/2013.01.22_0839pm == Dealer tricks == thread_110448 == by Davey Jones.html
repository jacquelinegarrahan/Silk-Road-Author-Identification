				Here&#039;s some stuff I&#039;ve seen;&nbsp; people getting coke in rock form thinking its more pure because its still rocked up(, not always the case).&nbsp; People can re-rock it in a press after what sometimes can be a significant amount of cut added.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen where people go solely by the numbness as a test if coke is good or not(I&#039;ve seen guys use procaine and similar things that can cause numbness).

				Yeah another one to watch out for is dealers calibrating their 1000g scale with a 900g weight because then .9 will read as 1g. You should either <br />A. check their scale with a US $20 bill and make sure it weighs a gram <br />B. Use your own scale<br />C. Buy from silkroad followed by step B. 8)

				Oh yeah, also i&#039;ve never seen this in real life but I know JimmyBuffett added purple food coloring or something to his vials so they would fool the elrich reagent. So watch out for people trying to fool reagents. <br />I actually read a thread on bluelight of someone who was posting bunk pills with good results to PR as some kind of marketing scheme so wait for a few confirmed pill reports.

People mistake the nail-polish smell (the acetone) is a sign off some fire blow, because its gone through a acetone wash, but its more likely that dealers use it to re-rock for cutting agents. Only users who actually care about the shit they put their nose go through the effort to perform an acetone wash. Also,&nbsp; numbing agents are added such as benzocaine and it mimics the look of quality coke as well. So too much numbing is a bad sign, and if your rail it and it stings like a bitch, its definitely cut. Last but not least, it has been reported that most coke before it is even shipped out from columbia, peru, bolivia or what not, the coca producers already put in a de-worming substance called levamisole into the kilos. Ratio is like 90% cocaine, 10% levamisole. This substance is extremely detrimental to health, especially for frequent users because it eats away the skin and people become prone to autoimmune diseases. <br /><br />As for weed, I&#039;ve seen scumbag dealers spray their plant with laundry detergent so it weighs more and when its dried, it becomes covered with speckles that mimic the tricomb crystals. It also mimics the sticky-ickyness of bomb herb that has been freshly harvested. Easy way to detect sprayed weed is that when you smoke it, it tastes disgusting..almost soapy. It&#039;s very throat punching, especially if you take bong hits. Another way to detect sprayed weed is by rubbing the buds on a cd disc and see if any crystals actually flake off. You can also find out if your dealer is fcking you if your weed starts to become moldy when you leave your stash in a air tight container.<br /><br />worst trick of all is god damn E dealers selling pipe bombs, meth bombs as ecstasy. Even worse, selling fake caps/powders. I&#039;ve seen loads of M1 capsules/powders flooding the market being sold as MDMA. Even encountered scumbags who&#039;ve sold god damn placebo caps (probably just baking powder or sugar who knows) to stupid ass raver kids at festivals and events. These young ravers from this generation really ought to experience those crazy MDMA/MDA combo pills they had back in the day.

				Those are just some tricks I&#039;ve actually seen people do.&nbsp; Pretty sad.&nbsp; Its not like they weren&#039;t making any money either, just greed.&nbsp; I have seen guys put over fifty percent cut on coke at ounce level, move it.&nbsp; Then the guys that ended up with the eight balls cut it again before they sold half grams. People still got plenty high too&nbsp; Then some people think by cooking it you can tell.&nbsp; That only works with certain types of cuts.&nbsp; Alot of people don&#039;t realize how good, good coke is, and how strong.&nbsp; I still have yet to find the real untouched product, I know its out there somewhere. I had some stuff before, years ago, that was just unreal, so I know how good it really can get, one little bump the size of a matchhead and your friggin high for over an hour, the lines don&#039;t burn, you hardly notice the comedown.&nbsp; On the weed, I&#039;ve seen people spray shit down with formaldehyde too, that shit is dangerous, or they dust it(pcp) a little and call it super weed or something.&nbsp; Blotter acid alot of times has strycnine on it, and speed mixed with the lsd, too much strycnine and you can feel it in your bones.&nbsp; I just figure if people are gonna pay top prices they oughta at least get top quality every time and not get messed with by getting some product that isn&#039;t tampered with.&nbsp; There&#039;s ways of cutting crack too.&nbsp; Alot of people think rock is pure cuz its cooked.&nbsp; Speed can be mixed with alot of shit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve known of people to take dilauded and grind it up, mix it with a little laxative, sell it as dope.&nbsp; I&#039;m not pointing fingers at any one person, there are some reputable folks out there that have quality.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t want the bullshit. People need to know what to look for in a product and deal with the real pirates so to speak.

				Yeah, the fake acid scam has been around for years.&nbsp; Now, with all the new RC&#039;s(research chemicals)out there, people can pass off some experimental shit. If people are willing to pay top prices they deserve top product, pretty simple.&nbsp; If people realized the markup from wholesale to retail, its freakin sick, even without cutting shit.&nbsp; A 2.2 brick is a thousand grams, without cut and just charging even less than 80$ per gram thats still double your money.&nbsp; Some people just need to keep it real so to speak.&nbsp;

				There are alot of ways dealers can possibly scam people while still providing real product and then there are dealers who are what I call real.&nbsp; Those are the people I respect the most, they are straight up, no bullshit.&nbsp; If the quality of their shit is a little down they tell you, if its superb, they tell you, and they adjust their prices accordingly and not try to make a killing off every sale.&nbsp; All that nickel and dime bullshit, what a joke.

				Only two times I&#039;ve bought mdma off the street I got sparkly off white powder that numbed my tongue and large rocks of ugly yellow M1 after being assured I would get only the best ecstasy after that I&#039;ve strictly gotten my stuff off of SR. You can get benzocaine off amazon like 100 grams for 30 USD or something like that. Its the active ingredient in Orajel and other OTC oral pain relievers. It mimics the numbing of coke and I&#039;ve seen many a dealer cut their gear with it. The fake acid scam happens all the time and it happened to me once. Bought 2 tabs and immediately tried them and they were extremely bitter, though I know real LSD is tasteless and odorless. I told the few other people that had bought the &quot;acid&quot; from the dealer that it was research chemicals and they freaked out, grabbed the throat and started screaming all rc&#039;d out and took their money back and gave me my money back. Serves him right I guess.

				Before I forget, people can also use a water/ammonia mix in a spray bottle and moisten their coke after being cut, then press it back together. Then its a product thats rock and smells too.&nbsp; I just look for the bricks and anyone worth talking to will have a smaller sample size to try out before getting the bigger amount.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d say the most common drug some people fuck with is coke because there are so many cuts that imitate the numbing and can give a fake euphoria at first.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t like there isn&#039;t enough coke to go around either.&nbsp; There&#039;s people out there that are worrying about just moving it, no cut. They just wanna get rid of it so they can get more.&nbsp; The selective scammers are the one&#039;s that irritate me the most because they build trust then hit people with some below grade underweight shit.

				I&#039;m not trying to be rude here, but you cannot expect any businessman to sell at a loss. It simply doesn&#039;t work that way. <br /><br />For instance - if I were selling coke, I would sell coke that I cut. Why? Because otherwise I won&#039;t make enough money to warrant (no pun intended) my ass ending up in the joint. <br /><br />If I&#039;m buying at $80/gram, I&#039;m stepping on that before I send it out at $80/gram. If I (and most dealers) could get raw bulk (and therefore save excessive money), we would sell pure. All of the vendors on SR who have pure product are getting it in bulk (if not manufacturing it themselves in the case of certain goods). However, since we are but lowly mortals who don&#039;t have the capital (or the connections) to get blocks of raw at wholesale, we have to cut our goods to make a profit.<br /><br />Now I will say this - there is NO excuse for selling M1 as MDMA, or stepped on nonsense as &quot;raw&quot;. That&#039;s just bullshit, and any dealer who pulls that deserves what happens to him. If I had product cut, I&#039;ll say it&#039;s cut. If I cap a blend, I&#039;ll name it and break down the contents for any who ask. That&#039;s just good business. <br /><br />If more sellers (of anything, really) would live by those standards, the Game would be a WHOLE lot different.
