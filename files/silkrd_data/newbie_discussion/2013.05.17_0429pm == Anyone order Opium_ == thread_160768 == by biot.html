				I gotta say that the search box has NEVER worked for me.&nbsp; Even when I put something simple in like &quot;opium&quot;, I get back zero results and a message to wait like 5 minutes before searching again.<br /><br />I have been assuming that newbies like me can&#039;t use search util we hit 50 posts?

				Just don&#039;t order from CharasBros. I learned my lesson. The &quot;opium&quot; he sent me was completely different than what I received, and was underweight. I don&#039;t even think he sent me real opium, it had the strangest consistency that almost would turn to sand.

Keep trying, wait a few seconds between trys.

Obviously the postman opened your package and took what CharasBros he sent and replaced it with some sand ....man have you even read what you wrote?
