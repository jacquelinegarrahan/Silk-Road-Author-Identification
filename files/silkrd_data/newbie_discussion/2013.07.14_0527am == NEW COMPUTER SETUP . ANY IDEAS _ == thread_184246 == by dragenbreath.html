				i have a macbook right now and its just not working the way i want it too. alot harder to run tails then it should be. <br /><br />im looking to start fresh. say hopefully under 1000 dollars to get a notebook and everything i need. i was looking at uglysurfer he sells bootable usb sticks. but when i searched his name in the forum there was one thread that was saying someone sold him a usb with a trojan on it. i wouldnt want any of that shit. i even messaged a vendor, NOT uglysurfer, who sells usb sticks also and asked him if it was even safe to buy the usb sticks and he said that it actually isnt because anyone could put something on it but then he went on to say he would never do that. so now im not sure <br /><br />either way i need a new computer to run tails. i need all the encryption pgp, tor, tor chat email, plus extras. thanks for the ideas ill post my setup when i actually get it

				SO I JUST got this message from the vendor who i mentioned that wasnt uglysurfer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That would be a very preferable option. I&#039;ll run through the preferred platform and utilities.<br /><br />You have the right idea going for netbooks. Easy to conceal, transport, and (if it comes to it) destroy. Most are powerful enough to run all the software required for a TOR server (I use a cheap laptops for my own anonymous TOR nodes and server).<br />You can also use a tablet type, but these are more expensive.<br /><br />So many netbooks though.<br /><br />Gerneally, you want one that is running at least a Intel Atom Processor. Keep it within laptops from 2010 and later. At least 2Gb RAM.<br /><br />One of the most important thing is to get a SSD hard drive, or solid state. You&#039;ll see why in a second, but they have a much faster read/write and can be formatted instantly. They are expensive compared to disk Hard Drives, but only in terms of cost/stoarge. So, for $40 extra bucks at Newegg.com you can get a 12-20gb SSD drive.<br /><br />Now, you have a fast laptop that&#039;s small. Now what.<br /><br />Get truecrypt. Once you have your OS installed (I&#039;m guessing Windows) install truecrypt. Then encrypt the OS partition and create a hidden partition. If you are ever forced to reveal your account, you can type a secondary password to the fake partition. Probably put some embarrassing pornography or furry stuff. Not implying anything, that&#039;s just what you would expect to find on this level of encryption. That and TOR.<br /><br />I prefer AES256 + Blowfish encryption.<br /><br />Then you can simply use windows like normal. Shut down, never hibernate. Don&#039;t worry about shutting the power off instantly. SSD drives can&#039;t get damaged like that.<br /><br />By the way, other than the laptop is all free except the OS.<br />For that just torrent Windows XP or Windows 2000 (two very secure versions). 2000 will have the benefit of being clean, some copies of XP can have Trojans.

				HP Envy Spectra&nbsp; Ultrabook comes with two options for a SSD, also includes an optical drive. My wife got one for class last semester, and she runs biostatistical algorythyms for epidemiological studies. It has the processing power and available ram to do everything but give me a blowie when I wake up, and the wife does that already, so the comp can do comp things. Just my fwiw.<br /><br />Also, they are below $1000, retail.
