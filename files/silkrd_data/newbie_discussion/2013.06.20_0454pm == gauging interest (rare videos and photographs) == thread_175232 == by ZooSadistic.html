				Hello everybody.&nbsp; we are here to gauge interest in very rare videos (varios formats available) and very rare photographs (poloroid and regular 35mm pictures, no digital formats available).&nbsp; we have partners here in EU as well as south east asia, japan, and great britian that supply our group with updated, never before circulated zoosadisim , simulated rape, bondage, simulated torture XXX films and photographs.<br /><br />there is a possibility of doing custom films and/or photographs for the right price.&nbsp; for example (stray dog gets tied and hung from celing while beaten with pipe).<br /><br /><br />we understand that in this business discretion is key, and will do beyond our best to maintain the level of discretion nessecary to conduct such transactions.&nbsp; we have many many years of distributing both films and photograps discreet, with no interception that we are aware of.&nbsp; in the same vein, you can send us message here, on forums to discuss possible vending from our group. again we are only gauging interest at this time, we will not do any sales and transactions outside of the marketplace until we are established vendors.

				hi<br />we are comfortable in our current trade.&nbsp; sure we may do odd jobs here and there on the side but making and distributing films and pictures of beastialty, snm, zoosadism is our main way of putting food in the table.&nbsp; if we could find a trade that was just as exciting, fresh, innovative and could pay what we get, then sure we would find yet another source to make money.

				Whilst i appreciate the handling can be tricky the administration is not, once you have obtained DB you will need to use a face mask whilst opening then simply add to water, stir well and leave (covered) to settle. After approx 3/4 hours you will have a very easy to handle solution that will not go air bourne. All you have to do then is spike said persons drink.

				What makes you think we can&#039;t beat and torture our own animals and minorities? You calling us pussies? I&#039;ve been raping and beating stray dogs since before you were swimming around in your Daddy&#039;s balls boy!<br /><br />Seriously though if you have this warped of a sense of morality and actually engage in these types of deviant behavior I think it&#039;s in the best interest of society for a bullet to find it&#039;s way balls to ballistics into your brainpan. <br /><br />Having actually coerced information out of enemy combatants through ungentlemanly means and seen my share of death, emaciation and destruction, if OP is legit he&#039;s one of those weird backward ass former soviet breakaway republic weirdos that drives a Hugo and fucks sheeps and roofies women in bars and has an extensive tracksuit collection... because torture is not pretty. <br /><br />I vomited after my first time. <br /><br />Please die. <br /><br /><br />

				hi<br />we decided that due to the large number of buyers on the marketplace that we will open up a vendor account and deal mostly with methaddict tabblets and brown heroin. as there is no potentiol buyers for our other wares. we have a longtime contact who has provided us with the means to sell these products here in the marketplace.<br /><br />please give us another month to get our situation ready for vending these products under a new moniker and we will very much gladly serve you.
