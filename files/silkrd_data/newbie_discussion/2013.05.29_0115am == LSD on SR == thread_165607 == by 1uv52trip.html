				I used to get gel tabs all the time, a different color every week. This was some of the best acid, one tab would send you on a journey and I never took more than 2. I lost that hook up 13 years ago and I was beginning to think I would never get to trip again before I found SR. I have tried many times since then with no luck. Last week I ordered some blotter tabs from clearance, it was my first SR experience and he could not have made the whole transaction any better. I took 3 tabs and I had a great trip, the visuals were a 10+ but I wanted to lose my mind a little and I didn&#039;t. I felt like if I took 4, it might have done it.. or maybe even 5. Is this typical, was I very spoiled with my gel tab hook up and I am just now realizing it?

				I&#039;m new to SR...but when I&#039;ve bought LSD it&#039;s always taken 4, 5 to get to the &#039;mind loss&#039; stage. I think you may have been a bit spoiled with these geltabs...they sound lovely&nbsp; :-*

				Yeah, LSD is one of the main reasons I joined SR. It&#039;s about impossible to get any psychedelics where I live. Meth, plenty. Psychs, not so much.

				I&#039;ll put in a plug for Tessellated&#039;s product. My first SR purchase, super stealthy. In over 20 years I have never tripped so hard off of one tab.

				Don&#039;t forget to check The Avengers&#039; thread. They post reviews and sometimes do lab tests of all LSD sellers on SR. The first post gets updated pretty regularly.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0

				If you&#039;re looking for some stronger stuff I would check out JesusofRave. He is a top 1% vendor too. He sells tabs that are 110ug and apparently his Mayan tabs rated at 180ug are suppose to be very strong and very clean. What you really should try out is his liquid lsd, it is suppose to be some of the best quality you can find.

				I will still send some for free for the next few days :) but there are many good vendors who are renowned for having very nice LSD as well. You can&#039;t go wrong really if you do a little research!

				Perhaps the LSD you had previously was a lower grade crystal to that you have ordered from the road? Purer crystal tends to give less of a mindfuck in my experience...
