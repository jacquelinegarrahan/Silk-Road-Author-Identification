				Hi all.&nbsp; I have been on the Road for a long time but I just recently made a forum account.&nbsp; These past few months I have been buying from a couple different cocaine vendors.&nbsp; Ultimately I would like to order from all the major C vendors but for now I will just share my experiences with these four.&nbsp; I will be rating each vendor on a scale of 1-10 for communication, shipping/stealth, price, and of course product.&nbsp; Now some of these vendors sell only &quot;pure cocaine&quot; and some of them sell &quot;party coke&quot;.&nbsp; I will not be comparing the vendors&#039; products because they are different.<br /><br />Licentia: Overall 10/10<br />Licentia was The first vendor I got coke from on SR.&nbsp; He is very respectful, polite, and always willing to help.<br />Communication: 10/10 I have spoken to Licentia many times and he is a pleasure to do business with.&nbsp; He is very nice and eager to help or answer any questions you may have<br />Shipping/Stealth: 9/10 The product is always vaccum sealed but if someone was to look inside the package it wouldnt take much for them to find it.&nbsp; Takes ~4 days to get to the East coast.<br />Price: Licentia has what he calls &quot;60+% party coke&quot; (not exact so dont quote me) Its not the best stuff, but it also is not advertised as that.&nbsp; You get what you pay for.<br />Product: The coke has a good smell, color, and high but it has given me light headaches.&nbsp; Not a huge deal.&nbsp; Once again at ~75$/gram its a good bang for your buck.<br /><br />BMG: Overall 9/10<br />I got one of BMG&#039;s .1 gram listings. <br />Communication: 10/10 I did not talk to BMG much but when I did he was always on the ball and willing to answer any questions. Very polite.<br />Shipping/Stealth: 10/10 Product came in a regular letter envelope and when opened I actualy had to take a minute to find it.&nbsp; ~4 days to East Coast<br />Price: 8/10 at ~13$ for a dime bag, its a bit pricey.&nbsp; But on the same token its not that much. His gram prices are a bit better but I think their still a little high for the quality.<br />Product: 9/10: Again for the price it isnt that great.&nbsp; Its is much better than street coke though.&nbsp; I would say its right in between 60+% &quot;party blow&quot; and uncut.<br /><br />Chaletla: Overall 10/10<br />I got a gram of his &quot;strait off the kilo&quot; coke.<br />Communication: 10/10 I didnt need to talk to him much but when I did he was very polite.<br />Shipping/Stealth: 10/10 I have ordered from quite a few vendors of all different products and Chaletlas stealth and shipping is by far the best I have seen.&nbsp; It took only 3 days to get to the East Coast which surprised the hell out of me.&nbsp; Now, the labeling on the package is not the most inconspicuous thing I have seen but I think that is all about each individual customer.&nbsp; When you open the package it takes quite a bit of digging to get to the goods.&nbsp; The most professional stealth I have seen.&nbsp; Lets say a family member was to open a package from Chaletla; they would defiantly NOT think anything was out of the ordinary.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot say enough about how awesome this vendors stealth is.<br />Price: 10/10 Very very good in comparison to other vendors.&nbsp; Compared to some vendors selling uncut C at ~150-190$/ gram, chaletlas 120$/gram price tag is amazing.<br />Product. 10/10 Chaletlas Cocaine blew me away (no pun intended ;) ) This stuff is awesome.&nbsp; Came as what looks like mostly powder but its really a bunch of tiny little rocks. You can tell it was once a big rock but simply was crushed for packaging. This stuff have an overpowering coke smell. I could smell it right through the bag and if I was to put it out in a small room like lets say a bathroom, I would be able to smell it slightly upon entering the room. Very smelly stuff. Very smooth up the nose and an amazing high. Straight euphoria.&nbsp; AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME COKE.&nbsp; Comedown is virtual non existent.&nbsp; Take it easy with this stuff, its strong.&nbsp; I am not that experienced with coke but a gram lasted me ~5 days of all day use.&nbsp; <br /><br />PureOrganx: Overall 10/10<br />PO is another uncut C vendor.&nbsp; I got a gram of his &quot;97% pure Coke&quot;.<br />Communication: N/A never had to contact PO<br />Shipping/Stealth: 10/10 On his vendor page he goes over how his shipping process works and he keeps to his word.&nbsp; The packaging is very inconspicuous and it takes some digging to get to the prize! ~4 days to East Coast<br />Price: 10/10 This vendor has possibly the best bang for your buck.&nbsp; At 109$/gram his price tag is very competitive.&nbsp; <br />Product: 10/10 This C is very very good.&nbsp; I got a gram and it came in a few big chunks.&nbsp; But first let me say this; there is no way this stuff is 97% pure.&nbsp; I dont know why it is advertized as such.&nbsp; Im not saying he puts a cut on it but even if he personally got a brick directly from a Colombian cartel I don&#039;t think it would be 97% pure.&nbsp; With that said it is still amazing coke.&nbsp; In every coke order this vendor throws in a free .25 which is awesome.&nbsp; If this was to be factored into the price it would be around 100$/gram which is why I said its possibly the best bang for your buck.&nbsp; The cocaine is very shiny but doesn&#039;t have an overwhelming smell.&nbsp; The smells between Chaletla&#039;s C and PO&#039;s C are total opposites.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this is a good or a bad thing.&nbsp; If someone could set this straight for me I would appreciate it.&nbsp; Very smooth up the nose but when you hit it its like WHAPAM!! or SHAZAM!! It hits you very hard instantly.&nbsp; Like Chaletla&#039;s, one gram (including the free .25 so a total of 1.25) lasted me about 5 days of all day use.&nbsp; Again I am not a very experienced cocaine user.&nbsp; <br /><br />With everything factored in I think I like PureOrganx&#039;s C the best (between the &quot;pure coke&quot; vendors). If I was to pick my favorite judging only on quality it would be a hard choice between PureOrganx and Chaletla.&nbsp; I think its all about personal preference.&nbsp; I think those two are just about equal in potency maybe with Chaletla&#039;s being just a bit better.&nbsp; If both vendors were to offer me a free gram I think I would go with Chaletla, but with everything else factored in I think I would go with PO.&nbsp; Simply because you get more for your money and PO&#039;s stealth fits me better (this is definably personal preference, a vendor cannot personaly customize stealth for each customer so it suits them better)<br /><br />I have not had a bad experience or even a neutral one with any of these vendors. They have all gone above and beyond the call of duty to make sure the customer is happy.&nbsp; I hope to at some point be able to sample Cocaine from some of the big names in the SR Cocaine scene like Nod, 10Toes, Studio54, Dragoncove, and so on. Let me know what you guys think! <br /><br />Much love,<br />Goose<br />

				Very good stuff here mate, I was about to put up my own thread here and ask what I should do with 1BTC, *all I have*...and have been looking at licentia..and some other&#039;s. Still not quite sure yet where i&#039;m going to go with it. Any more tips/reads would be nice. I have been on the C purity/vendor threads but as I only have 1 coin I am in need of some help :) <br /><br />Overall your OP is very good and informative, to me bro! keep it up :) I am the same where I want to get a few under my belt and then try and try the more pure. I have done C in the past but its been a good few years! Can&#039;t stop anticipating doing again!

				I have tried Pureorganx C and I thought it was very good but not excellent. But for the price, compared to the others 135 -160 /g it&#039;s a good bang for the buck IMO. I&#039;m thinking about ordering&nbsp; from JustSmuggledN the pic looks very pretty!! And so far i haven&#039;t heard anything negative.
