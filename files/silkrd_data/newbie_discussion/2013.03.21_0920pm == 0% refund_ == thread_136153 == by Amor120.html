				Title: <strong>0% refund?</strong><br />

				I ordered 2.2 BTC worth of DMT and the guy ripped me off. I ordered it Febuary 10 and it was marker &quot;in transit&quot; the next day. Over a month later and nothing. The fucked up thing is I made sure to keep the coins in escrow after the guy said it was on its way. When I finally had enough of the wait I let it finalize and asked for a 100 percent refund. I just got a message today saying it was decided I get 0%back, what kind of bullshit is this. Not only did the guy string me along for over 5 weeks he gets to keep my money too? Isn&#039;t this what escrow is for.<br />There are several other reviews on the product since I ordered saying they had similar problems,I just don&#039;t understand why I didn&#039;t at least get half back.

Are you saying you let it auto finalize and then took it to resolution?

				&#039;Finalize&#039; means that either by clicking on the &#039;finalize&#039; button or by not doing anything and letting it &#039;auto finalize&#039; (bad juju, no dealer likes that!) you let the guy get the money. Also you didn&#039;t &#039;leave&#039; the money in escrow, you don&#039;t have a choice, if you buy something and start the process, your money is tied up until you &#039;finalize&#039; or take it to SR for mediation. <br />Sounds like you didn&#039;t know what finalization meant.
