				Hey all<br /><br />Never smoked or done anything in my life. I have now decided to try marijuana, due to feeling the pressures of life. I just need to be able to &quot;switch off&quot; and feel good.<br /><br />For a cheap starter, I was planning on using a pipe... I heard glass was the best, is this true. Can you recommend a pipe for marijuana on SR, as I know some are meant for meth. Lastly, what do you recommend a newbie to try/use first? My plan was blue viper. Alas, I&#039;ve never smoked anything in my life.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Personally I only roll joints unless it&#039;s some super AAA+ medicine then I use a small one hit type. One suggestion, either buy a mid grade or smoke one hit and wait 15-20 mins before taking another if you have the &quot;shazam&quot; weed. Some of this medicine is really strong, take it slow and have a blast.

Definitely use glass, they are not expensive at all. As for recommendation of a pipe on SR for weed? I&#039;m not sure, as I can buy pipes at any smoke shop since I&#039;m 18. I&#039;m assuming you are under 18, or can&#039;t access one locally at all. They are normally sold as &quot;Tobacco pipes&quot; for legal purposes. If you haven&#039;t smoked ANYTHING in your life, I recommend taking it slow. After taking a hit, wait 10-30 minutes before taking another. No rush to dive into it headfirst. Try to get a sativa strain if you can, as it will keep you more alert. Sativa&#039;s are head highs while Indica&#039;s are body highs, and typically make people sleepy. Both are great, but I recommend a sativa first. If you don&#039;t know which strain is a sativa or indica, google search it. <br /><br />Good luck!

				troll? lol<br /><br />so you&#039;re telling me that you&#039;re on a forum that promotes the anonymous sale and distribution of substances, but you&#039;ve never smoked pot before? Kind of taking the trip in reverse, imo.

				You can buy small pipes on amazon and other web sites . If you have never smoked before , I think you can expect to cough allot , don&#039;t inhale too much. For reasons nobody seems to understand , many people don&#039;t get high the first few times they smoke (I didn&#039;t). You might think you&#039;re immune to THC , but it will work eventually.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that many people just do not like the effects of marijuana, so don&#039;t invest too heavily until you have some idea of weather you are going to like it or not. You should try to get the best AAA medical superbud you can. You will only have to smoke a few puffs to get a decent effect. If you get mids or regs , it might be cheaper but you will have to smoke allot more to get an effect.

				Since you&#039;re just starting out I won&#039;t jump out and rave about my vaporizer lol. I would start off with a joint personally, since pipes can be quite harsh for beginners. If you can&#039;t roll well, get a friend to do it for you. You may also want to experience it with a close/trusted friend if u have one for the first time.<br /><br />Enjoy!&nbsp; :D

				Heh, wanting to first try weed using SR? It&#039;ll probably be easier to find someone you know who smokes, since they can help you out with it (and perhaps let you do it for free!). Personally, when I was just starting out, I didn&#039;t enjoy pipes. Too much handwork, and the smoke was harsh. Like National Direct said, joints, blunts, or essentially anything rolled is much easier for beginners. But you can&#039;t master rolling when starting out, either. I would definitely say that making the most use out of pipes requires a bit of practice, though, and it&#039;s not a very good method for someone trying it their very first time.

				Hey,<br />First time I tried smoking weed it was through a joint. I can see why some people would recommend a pipe for a first timer, as rolling a joint oneself takes a bit of practice. However, as others have said, in my opinion the smoke from a pipe is too harsh for a beginner, and may have you hacking-up a lung which could put you off the idea of smoking bud for a while. A joint is a nice way to start off as its a smoother smoke, and if you feel you&#039;re getting too high you can simply put it out, just as you can stop hitting a pipe. Plus, a single hit off a joint is much less strong than a hit off a pipe, so a joint may allow you to ease into the high more smoothly, and not get hit in the face by it ;)<br /><br />Whatever you do, definitely don&#039;t try a bong first; it&#039;s too difficult to measure the size of your hit and will definitely have you coughing like an idiot! At the end of the day you don&#039;t have to worry too much, it&#039;s definitely not going to kill you no matter how much you smoke. Oh, and as someone already said, a sativa strain is better for a first-timer as it&#039;s less &#039;stoney&#039;, but an indica will do if you can&#039;t get the former. <br /><br />Good luck,<br />- JH
