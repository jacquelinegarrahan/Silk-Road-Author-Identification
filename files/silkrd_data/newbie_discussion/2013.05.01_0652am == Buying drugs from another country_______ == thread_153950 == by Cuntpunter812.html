				Of course they search it but that is the reason for &quot;Stealth&quot; shipping.<br />The seller in Spain would not be selling it to USA customers if he knows he can&#039;t get it through Customs. <br />Look at his reviews, see if he has successful sales.

				They dont check/search all incoming mail anyway. Its a random selection. Thats why sometimes you can order legit shit like clothes from other countries and end up paying extra tax on them, and other times they fly straight through.

Package will be made as flat as possible. Possibly also packed with magazines or cardboard. Sniffer dogs dont run up n down the sorting line sniffing every piece of mail. Only mail from suspect countries may be examined more closely. Packages are really the only thing that could possibly be examined more closely. 5g of hash aint gonna be a package. <br /><br />Don&#039;t stress out mate , just roll the dice and place your order<br /><br />All the best n good luck with your first international buy&nbsp; :)

				The stealth of packaging is one of the many factors that we can judge vendors by.&nbsp; Check their reviews and forum pages to see what other buyers have said.&nbsp; Generally if these results are good then the odds are in your favor.<br /><br />Some countries have different customs policies.&nbsp; For example, the Netherlands are generally more strict with outgoing mail as much of the MDMA around the world is manufactured there.&nbsp; It stands to reason that packages from these countries could undergo extra screening entering a country as well.<br /><br />I think Spain is fairly moderate when it come to this, so you should be fine.

				I&#039;ve only made one international order and that was from Canada, but I didn&#039;t have any problems.&nbsp; As long as the vendor has a decent rep you will be fine.&nbsp; Worst case scenario you receive a &quot;love letter&quot; from customs.

				A lot depends on what part of the country you are in too. I&#039;d stick with domestic, but that leaves out a lot of good stuff from overseas.

				I think you just have to read the vendors feedback and decide if the vendor take proper care of stealth packaging. The odds are that if the vendor has possitive reviews on their packanging then it is highly unlikely you would have any problems.
