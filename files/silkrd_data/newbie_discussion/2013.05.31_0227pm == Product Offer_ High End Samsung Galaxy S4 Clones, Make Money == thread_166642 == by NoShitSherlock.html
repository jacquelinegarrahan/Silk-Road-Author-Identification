				I&#039;ve had an SR account for about a year with several thousand spent, but never registered on the forums till now . Since I&#039;m a newbie and I can&#039;t post outside here, and really didn&#039;t want to have to spam 50 posts I&#039;m just posting this here right now. Feel free to ask questions.<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m going to be coming into some money soon and I&#039;ve been thinking of investing it, and if I have enough demand this can be a win-win for a lot of people.<br /><br />I have an excellent factory connection in China (not cheap shit) for almost perfect high quality clones of the Galaxy S4, brand new in the Samsung retail box and with all original logos and all original packaging down to the accessories and even the plastic screen covers and whatnot. The clones have the exact same dimensions and weight as the real deal, and the for the most part the same outside materials and glass, as well as internal hardware, only a slightly lower resolution screen (still HD) and run on Android 4.2 Jellybean. They are unlocked and on GSM/3G, and can set up anywhere and work perfectly. They have the exact same wifi, gps, camera MP, etc as the real S4 too. And most importantly when held the phone has the right feel, and definitely doesn&#039;t feel cheap or even remotely like anything except the real thing.<br /><br />Now what can you do with one of these? Sell it to shmucks at near retail price, of course! Craigslist (personal favorite), eBay, your friends, your local drug dealer/pimp, etc.<br /><br />The best part is that it&#039;s not a scam, they won&#039;t even know they don&#039;t have a real Samsung phone because it&#039;ll work and feel *literally* EXACTLY the same as the real deal. Or you can just keep it for yourself and use it as your own phone because it&#039;s not a scam, it&#039;s a perfectly functional Samsung Galaxy S4 that just wasn&#039;t officially made by Samsung.<br /><br />I can sell them for around $300 each, and you can sell them as factory unlocked, brand new phones anywhere from $500-$800 on Craigslist or eBay easily and very quickly since they&#039;re really popular and in high demand.<br /><br />Well, let me know what you think and if you have any questions, I can and will eventually get a list of the exact specs and some pictures, but right now this is just an exploratory thing so I really don&#039;t think every technical detail on the phone is absolutely necessary at this point.<br />

				If this is something that does go ahead I will be looking to bulk buy and resell myself \, if they are decent. Do you have any other gadgets you can get access to of the same quality.

				I hear ya, a lot of the clones out there of popular phones are downright plastic shit. I&#039;ll definitely post pictures or a video with one of the phones in detail. The trick is to find the right connections which can be difficult, and of course some phones can be copied flawlessly and profitably, while others like the iPhone never will because of proprietary firmware and difficult-to-replicate metal and glass design. Right now I think I&#039;ll just start off with the S4, but in the future I can definitely list other popular Android phones. And I can offer drop shipping by DHL or similar so phones can be delivered in less than a week and since I don&#039;t have to stock them you don&#039;t have to pay for shipping twice (from the factory to me, then me to you) or for storage costs and you get them as cheap as possible with bulk pricing at any quantity. And for bulk purchases I can provide the same factory discounts.

				Hi NoShitSherlock,<br /><br />These may well fall under the restricted items list as their purpose is to defraud innocent people; you would need to clear it with an administrator before listing them once you have purchased a vendor account.<br /><br />You can read more about the restricted items list here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Restricted_items<br /><br />Libertas

				Well that would be important. How can I talk to an admin before I buy a seller account? Wouldn&#039;t have much use for one if the phones aren&#039;t allowed. And the purpose isn&#039;t to defraud, they really are high quality perfectly working phones, just &quot;generic&quot; basically, made with the same exact hardware but not by Samsung so it&#039;s way cheaper. It&#039;s clearly not stolen or non-functional, which the restricted items seem more focused toward. Also if I&#039;m not mistaken there is a popular vendor selling counterfeit coins and bullion with no problem, and that&#039;s explicitly forbidden.
