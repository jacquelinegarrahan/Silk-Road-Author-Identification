				right now i&#039;m running tor on my everyday computer... is it dumb to order like that?<br /><br />i think i&#039;m going to buy a usb stick and use the liberte method on the complete all in one guide thing. i will also make all new accounts for everything. if i do that and things do go sour, can i be tracked because i have TOR on my laptop already? <br /><br />to get the bitcoins i want to use blue sky traders though. can i just give them my SR wallet address and have them send the coins there? i mean, obviously i can, but is it foolish? i&#039;m not going to be ordering crazy amounts of anything, just stocking up my personal stash since the drug scene where i&#039;m at is all rc&#039;s <br /><br />

				i&#039;m capable, but do a lot of people who purchase personal amounts do this or do they still use the usb way?<br /><br />and i&#039;m mainly wondering if its smart to give blueskytraders my SR wallet info or if a tumbling service is necessary...<br /><br />

So either way. Just be sure you&#039;re using every precaution and if you have any hesitation about using your personal computer, then don&#039;t use it.<br />Having tor on your computer is not illegal. Having bitcoins is not illegal. It&#039;s purchasing drugs from SR that is illegal.<br />I personally don&#039;t use blueskytraders or any bitcoin vendor on here. I just simply wouldn&#039;t trust a vendor from going bad. I used to use bitinstant and mtgox but I&#039;m cutting that out and going to give bitfloor a try. There&#039;s plenty of other methods of acquiring bitcoins-do some research and see what works best for you, what&#039;s most secure, and what doesn&#039;t work with the government.<br /><br />Feel free to PM me, I&#039;ve been on the road for over a year now. :) Good luck!
