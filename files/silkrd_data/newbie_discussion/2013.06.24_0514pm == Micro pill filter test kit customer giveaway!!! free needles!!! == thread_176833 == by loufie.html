Don&#039;t worry nothing is left in the filter and no loss of buzz is endured. 10ml of sterile injecting water and alcohol skin preps and normal synthetic filters are also included.<br /><br />Rules apply:<br />you must be my fan<br />and be in the process of ordering my intro packs which are very cheap anyway.<br /><br />there is a token fee of $2 attached to order.<br />This can be used to send ahead as a test for your drop point before completion of the attached order but extra flat rate postage that is discounted applies.

				Not having a go, but I would be more delicate with how you list the different shipping options. As well as reconsidering the domestic shipping charges, they seem considerably high and even unclear as to what your customer is paying for<br /><br />Hope it goes well for you, good luck<br /><br />SP

				The information should be based on what your carrier is offering you. Assume you have already worked out your chosen methods of shipping to different destinations, and possible additional services some customers may require - tracking, registered mail, express etc.<br /><br />I would make a clear separation between Domestic &amp; International - and try not to offer too many options;<br /><br />Domestic - Express Post - 0.10<br />International - Mail no tracking - 0.20<br />International - Express tracking - 0.40<br /><br />Have a look to see what other worldwide vendors are doing with this, too many options can become confusing. Also you must remember that the service you are using must be accurately represented in the title, more detail is then usually listed in the body of the product listing (if required).
