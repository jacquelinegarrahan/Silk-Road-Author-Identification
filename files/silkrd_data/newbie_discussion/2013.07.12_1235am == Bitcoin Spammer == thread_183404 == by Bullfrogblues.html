				Makes sense why they want a 50 post minimum when we have guys like this spamming the forums. But holy hell that is a cheap price, I highly doubt it&#039;s legit though.

				No, it&#039;s not legit. He keeps making sites with new URL&#039;s after the old ones get too well known as being a scam. He might fill the orders on 1 or 2BTC I don&#039;t know. The 10 BTC special, always below the market rate, is the one I think he scams on.

				Oh yah I&#039;m sure people fall for it, enough to make it profitable to keep setting up new scam sites regularly.<br /><br />Ok we&#039;ll see if this does anything. I asked a friend to report this scammer just to PayPal for violating the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, which says you cannot use it to &#039;involve currency exchanges or check cashing businesses&#039;. Cat&#039;s paypal account is bbbfunding@live.com. So not sure if that will do anything but it&#039;s worth a try.<br /><br />This scammer&#039;s sites never support HTTPS:// which should be a big alarm to anyone using such a service.
