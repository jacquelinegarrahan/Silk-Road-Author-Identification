				&nbsp;Hi, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What I mean by the title is that there should be some way for vendors to limit the number of times a listing can be bought, in order to prevent more orders being made when there is no stock..<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve got an order now, made yesterday, and I&#039;ve just had a message that it won&#039;t be sent until Monday.&nbsp; The only reason I can think of for this is a lack of stock. The item is still listed.<br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s say someone has 5 ounces of uber dank and he lists it as 8ths. there should be a way for him to limit the listing to 40 orders, to prevent people ordering and having to wait/cancel/take something else. In my mind, as soon as the 40th order gets made, the listing would automatically be removed/hidden, until the vendor gets more in and resets his listing.<br />&nbsp;Now, I&#039;m not really moaning about it, as people do run out of things, and the vendor is going to give me some extra, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that my plans for the weekend are now kaput.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m sure an option like this, wouldn&#039;t be hard for the team to integrate into the SR system.<br /><br />&nbsp;If someone with 50 posts could copy this to the requests thread, that would be great.<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not a vendor but maybe this feature already exists? If you put an item in your cart sometimes it will have a max: value near the quantity. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s just the max for your particular order, or the max that the vendor will allow to be sold of that item.

				I am pretty sure that the number in the cart, is the number of listings the vendor have available. On numerous occasions i have seen that number slowly decline day, by day, and when it hits 0, the listing disappear until the vendor have had a chance to restock.<br /><br />However i think that this number will often be an approximate, because the vendors have listings for different amounts, and these are probably not pegged to each other (if you buy a 5 G listing the number on the 1 G listing will obviously not be declining).<br /><br />I am not a vendor so I am not 100% sure this is the way it works, but from what i have observed, it seems likely.
