				letting you know now, if you want a spacecase for vaping you are best off getting a 2 piece for that purpose rather a 4 piece, especially if you are looking for the larger ones. i think a 4 piece small spacecase is fine enough for vaping however.

				I had a sharpstone brand myself.&nbsp; One of the ones with a crank on the top.&nbsp; I found a picture of it (clearnet warning):<br /><br />http://hayksmokeshop.com/product_images/n/593/sharpstone-hand-mill-grinder__72170.jpg<br /><br />I loved this grinder until one day I got some extra sticky buds.&nbsp; I mean the kind of sticky where you handle it and put your fingers together and they&#039;re stuck to each other.&nbsp; The crank did not hold up to this sticky bud and it busted.&nbsp; Up until that point I was very happy with it and it did the trick.&nbsp; But in the future I know to forget the fancy grinders with cranks on them.&nbsp; <br /><br />And unless the metal shavings were so microscopic that you can&#039;t see them with your naked eye I&#039;m positive I never got any of that from my grinder.&nbsp;

				Do it like a man, mix with ur hands!<br />No, seriously I don&#039;t knwo the anser to ur question, but it made me remember the time when Kratom came in whole leaves, and not a talky fine powder. <br />We used to sit for hours grinding those leaves by hands and sorting out the sticks. this must have been about 2000. It was quite a nice ritual really!

				Yes, I&#039;ve been using Kratom daily for about 4 years, no reverse side-effects, except dry mouth when I wake up. <br />I live part time in Thailand where it grows naturally. Thailand is famous for having hard laws on the plant. Amazingly though it seems Kratom is gonna be legal in Thailand within a few months! They ae now doing studies if they should legalize or not.<br />The reason let alone is even more amazing. it so happens lots of kids started mixing trmadol with Sugary sodas, which they claim makes tramadol active as a drug (don&#039;t ask me why, Thais like to believe a lot of stuff). This made the authorities wan to bann the sale of tramadol in Pharmacies. But in fact tramadol is already banned for private sale since many years...<br /><br />So, it seems the gov. realized that they can&#039;t really handle the situation since they don&#039;t have a system with scripts as most nations have... Therefore their way to counter the problem is to legalize kratom, so kids will stop use tramadol to get high... benzos for examaple have been illegal to buy for many years there, still u can find them on almost every Pharmacy on the island and in inner Bangkok (sukhumvit, Silom etc). <br />Semi-Quoted from bangkok Post (from how I remember it). &quot;This is not as controversial as it may sound, many countries use less harmful drugs to counter the use of the more harmful drugs&quot;... Hmm, might be true to some extent, just not the way they think of it, but they are not known to think of anything that happens outside their borders as ong as it doesn&#039;t offend their Thainess or Their King. <br /><br />I feel really sorry for the Kiwi guy who got caught a few years ago carrying 9 Diazepam pills in Phuket. Do you think the Pharmacy got caught? if so, think again... <br />Even on the parallel road to the backpacker heaven Khao San you can see a huge banner saying &quot;VALIUM AND VIAGRA SOLD HERE!&quot;, which some sketchy Pakistanis hanging around, just about 40-50m meters from Channasongkhram Police Station. So of course they know hat&#039;s going on, and mostly they don&#039;t hassle tourist about it, unless when the Gov. send them out to make an example of how good Thailand is fighting the war on drugs.<br /><br />I have more stories about this. For example. Thailand was supposed to take action on the increase of meth sold within Bangkok. The next day the police had arrested about 50 dealers. Which obviously means they knew which people to look for...<br /><br />but yea, back to Kratom. Wonderful plant, no need to order from SR. There&#039;s loads of trusted vendors in the U.S. Don&#039;t expect any amazing kazoom drug though. But it&#039;s a nice pick up during the day, and I prefer it to coffee. Too much will make u drowsy though and give u a slight opiate-like euphoria. <br />It works wonders for tappering other drugs.<br />And for my 4-5 years of daily use, I did have periods of a week here a month there when I didn&#039;t bother buying the stuff. To stop was no problem, nothing like opiates. However the lack of ritual was harder, and made me go for a few beers before night time instead.<br />Someone said &quot;being addicted to oxy or heroin is like having an elephant on your back, very hard to lift off. being addicted to kratom however is like having a smallm annoying monkey climbing around ur body. it&#039;s annoying at most, but nothing u can&#039;t handle. The RLS is the biggest problem for me, but that I suffered from even before I knew what opioids where. However, after living years without RLS it seems harder to get used to it again, for obvious reasons.. <br />

				I picked up a Santa Cruz Shredder about a month ago - I like it so far. I should have gone for a few sizes up though (first time using it so I got the tiny cheaper one to make sure I liked the quality.)
