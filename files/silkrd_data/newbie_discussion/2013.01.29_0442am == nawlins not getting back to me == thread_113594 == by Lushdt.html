				I ordered two 25mg caps of 2cb from nawlins on Sunday, and PMed him three times, but my package is still &quot;processing,&quot; and he hasn&#039;t responded to nay of my PMs.&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp; And no, I didn&#039;t FE.

				Give it some time.<br />All vendors are different - some will put the order in transit right away while others might take a couple of days.<br />Too early to panic.

				Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; I&#039;m just hoping to get it before next week, but I&#039;m going to an awesome rave/concert.&nbsp; Is not responding to PMs normal for a vendor?&nbsp; The other two vendors I PMed replied very quickly.

				unreliable vendor - ordered on 4th Jan and all paid for. After a month of non-delivery he promised a reship. A month later that has not arrived either. He also promised a refund that hasn&#039;t materialized either. And he is always full of bulshit excuses in his profile page.

				I&#039;m sorry you guys are having such bad experiences. When i order my 2c-b caps a month ago, he put it in-transit within a day and it was in my mailbox within 4 days. When was the last time he was on? Maybe something happened..

				If you didn&#039;t FE I wouldn&#039;t see the point in trying to rip you off. He probably ran out of stuff or got held up.

				Don&#039;t worry about nawlins actually ripping anyone off.&nbsp; He&#039;s a good person, who has quality product.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had numerous good experiences with him.&nbsp; If he isn&#039;t responding, I&#039;m sure he has a good reason.

				I don&#039;t believe I got ripped off. He has communicated his previous ship out date(s). still have not received though, and it is most likely delayed and shit (either by him or shipper).&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he&#039;s a solid vendor, which I why I bought in the first place. I just don&#039;t know what to think at this point, with an order missing and a seller not communicating. perhaps it will turn up in the next day or so, which would make all this worry go away.

				He ripped me off after I FEd. But I dont necessarily think he is a rip off merchant. He is just unreliable. Especially for international shipments. He probably cannot cope with more than couple of orders a day!!!

				I would not recommend anyone using Nawlins. Only tracking number I got was nowhere near me and I never got product. Basically I got ripped off.
