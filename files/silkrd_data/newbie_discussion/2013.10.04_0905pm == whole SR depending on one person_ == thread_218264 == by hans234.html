				i cant believe that it is possible to shut down whole SR in catching one person.<br />how can it be that they take his computers and shut down SR? if it were a real professional thing that should be impossible. could it be that there was full access to everything with only one password?<br />did they never heared something about things like rsbak, multiple server hosting for one service, disk encryption, or even BACKUPS?<br />why not load backup to another Hoster, give it an new address and be back on business? in an IT service there should NEVER be a single point of failure.<br /><br />i simply cant believe that SR was such an unprofessional noob thing or am i understanding something wrong? where are the &quot;SR admins&quot; every person was talking about? where are the news &quot;backup is coming up under following address?&quot;<br /><br />i think next version (if it comes up) needs a bunch of real IT professionals doing the job.<br /><br />mybe im wrong, mybe im very wrong but im really shocked due to the story and it feels like they forgot the simplest it security rules

				this is what i&#039;ve been trying to point out and everyone seems unconcerned about. this is from a story posted on the usatoday site<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">FBI and other federal agents first tapped into the site in November 2011 and have made more than 100 undercover purchases of controlled substances, including ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD, on the network. The drugs came from vendors located in the United States and at least 10 other countries, court papers say. Agents also purchased hacking services, including malicious software such as password stealing programs, the court papers say.<br /><br />Federal investigators also gained access to the site&#039;s servers to conduct forensic studies that could trace buyers, sellers and the operator, court papers said. In an 18-month periodetween Feb. 6, 2011 and July 23, 2011, analysts tracked more than 1.2 million transactions involving nearly 147,000 buyers and nearly 4,000 vendors, the FBI said. The sales generated 9.5 million in Bitcoins, which are worth $1.2 billion.<br /><br />On a daily basis, FBI investigators found, Silk Road held more than $2 million worth of Bitcoin in escrow as customers completed their transactions.<br /><br />http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/02/fbi-shuts-down-silk-road-website/2909023/</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />it seems they could have easily shut the silk road down from pretty much the start. but they didn&#039;t because they wanted arrests. <br /><br />the feds were bang out of order allowing this to carry on for so long. <br /><br />if a customs officer happens upon a consignment of illegal drugs passing through an airport, they either have to seize them on the spot in order to prevent them getting into the country and putting citizens at risk of the harmful effects of the drugs. or they can do a controlled delivery in order to arrest the people involved in smuggling them. they must only do a controlled delivery under very tight conditions and the prevention of the drugs getting into the country must always be the top priority.<br /><br />that is what the whole premise of the drug laws are based on, preventing the harmful effects from the drugs on society.<br /><br />the feds have simply sat by and watched tons of drugs enter the country just so they could gather evidence to arrest one man.<br /><br />they&#039;ve actually seriously fucked up on this one.

				i dont think much customers and vendors seems unconcerned. especially the ones who doing this for years, the paranoid ones ^^<br />i think if you are using tor and vpn and external internet connection in the right way the only real risk is the delivery address.<br />i know that nothing is really secure but people security is not the point. everyone knows the risk but i think if you use a really good fake delivery address its much more secure than walking or driving to local dealer where 50 people go in and out.<br /><br />im wondering about how &quot;easy&quot; they shutdown the website and why there are no &quot;admins&quot; with backups to restart the site. if they are going to do i think it would not be so silent.<br />i now a thing like SR especially the bitcoin and escrow service is not easy to backup but such a big thing with so much money in escrow like the feds said should have good disaster plans.<br /><br />lets see what will happen. the market is not dead and its growing. only the platform was shut down.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">that is what the whole premise of the drug laws are based on, preventing the harmful effects from the drugs on society. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>they should let me do at home what i want and should solve real existing problems but thats a topic which is ineffectual to discuss ^^ older people dieing will solve this sometime i hope ^^

				I do remember reading somewhere that DPR had control of certain passwords no one else knew to assure safety for all, so if they had happened to catch him right when he was logged into those areas, things would be bleak.

				&quot;logged into those areas&quot; indeed - in a library, or cafeteria, where was it now he was allegedly arrested?<br /><br />...a zillion pieces of detail stink to high heaven in this whole case. makes it a lot more interesting than just the fact we lost something that was... like a good dream, while it lasted... or did it actually end yet?

				Maybe the admins do have access to it, and instead of releasing the funds to our backup account. They released the funds to their own personal escrow and pretend like there was no backup plan. Would you start up a new site and risk your neck when you got tens of millions? I don&#039;t think so.
