				You&#039;ve contracted on localbitcoins to make a bank deposit.&nbsp; Now, what&#039;s your play when you roll into the bank with nothing but some cash and an account number?<br /><br />The deposit slip says to put down a name and address and have your ID ready.<br /><br />Can you share your story?&nbsp; It worked for me and I&#039;ll share my experience later.. so I can pump up my post count..

				I was a dumbass and filled out my own name and address and she looked puzzled when she entered the account number.&nbsp; Who&#039;s John Snow? she asked and I said he&#039;s the guy I&#039;m buying something from.&nbsp; She then chucked out my slip and filled one out correctly, which if I had a photographic memory I&#039;d have his address.<br /><br />Still, anyone go and just put an account number in?&nbsp; What do they say?

				So next time on localbitcoins, rather than dashing off to the bank the instant I commit to buy, I should contact the seller and find out his name.&nbsp; I mean, it worked this time but I felt a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; I think that I came dressed for work helped and that I&#039;m old for a n00b

It&#039;s usually a made up business sounding name on the ones I&#039;ve used .<br />Example....<br />Deposit&nbsp; amount - 260 clams <br />Account name - Sally&#039;s Suckjob Emporium and Chimney Sweeping<br />Account # 0000000000069<br />I&#039;ve never had to contact the seller to ask anything

				Yep, yep, 88, you got it right. That&#039;s how I roll. I&#039;ll give you business name and account number. Fill out the slip with the name and account and that&#039;s it. No info from you needs submitted. Simple as that. The most complex part is emailing back and forth to set up a time for you to make the deposit and me to send the coins to you so you aren&#039;t waiting. Hit me up if you are interested in coins - libertycoin@safe-mail.net via PGP if you desire.

They see tons of people everyday, they would demand extra pay if they had to listen to everyone&#039;s story. Just give them the information they need, whatever information you would ordinarily have when buying something. Make sure your info (account number, name, whatever your country/bank needs) is complete. Clerks can completely BSOD if you feed them incorrect or incomplete information.<br /><br />If you somehow happen to run into the new guy or girl who is way to talkative, you just say you bought something on the internet. If they ask what (they shouldn&#039;t), it&#039;s private. Let them giggle if they want.<br /><br />If the account name says &quot;John&#039;s Leather Dreams and Pizza Restaurant&quot;, just say you bought a hairdryer and act nervous. They&#039;ll understand.
