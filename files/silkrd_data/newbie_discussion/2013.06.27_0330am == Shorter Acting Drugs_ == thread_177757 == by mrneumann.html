				So I had a conversation with a friend today talking about drugs with a shorter duration; the conversation being that there arent many. There are so few drugs that last 2-4 hours, everything either lasts 6+ or is done within around 10 minutes. He has been getting bored of weed lately and wants something he can do after work when he only has a few hours to kill. The only drugs I can think of that last 2-4 hours are weed, ketamine, mdma, small doses of 2c-x, coke (not exactly the thing we&#039;re looking for), and some other shitty stims. Can anyone think of any others? Mainly psychedelics, there seem to be almost none.

				Some of the more potent opioids like oxycodone/morphone and hydromorphone have pretty short half-lifes.&nbsp; If you get your dosage right with Dilaudid, you&#039;ll have a fantastic body high for a few hours, without the laid out, zonked effect you get from higher doses or more intense opioids.<br /><br />Of course, take too much and you&#039;ll just end up laying on your bed for the night.

				Yes most of the mdma analogues last around 4 hours or so. And for me, at least in higher doses, mushrooms lasted more like 5 with another hour comedown, nothing I could really sleep on. Good point on the opiates, personally they arent really my thing, but to each his own and you made a good suggestion.

				Snort a low dose of 2c family. Should be what ur looking for but heard it was more painful than mdma. Which I don&#039;t really mind the pain I&#039;ve snorted 100 dmt freebase and it was great but also the pain factor because of lye

				I used to take an Ativan after work, would chill me right out and stops effecting you in just a couple hours. You can&#039;t take it every day though, very addictive.
