				Hello people, i am looking for a list of vendors to buy bitcoins from. I have searched this topic and have found a few vendors that i think i can trust. I want to stay totally anonymous, so i would prefer to post cash. I would like if fellow members could tell me their stories good and bad about vendors which provide this service. Also vendors i would like to hear from you also about rates and such. Thank you.<br /><br />peace and gratitude
