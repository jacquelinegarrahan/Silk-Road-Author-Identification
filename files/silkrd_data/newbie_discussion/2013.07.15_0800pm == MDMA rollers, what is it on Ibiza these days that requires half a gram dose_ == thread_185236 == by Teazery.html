				I&#039;ve been on Ibiza this June, and they have sold be some crystals, brown, that required me to roll 0,5 grams.&nbsp; And it wasn&#039;t enough.&nbsp; Next time, just 0,75 gram made me feel somewhat good.&nbsp; Is it just so dirty MDMA, or what?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think short-term tolerance was in effect &#039;cause days prior to this we ate piperazine (sold as ecstasy) and maybe some aspirin. And 0,25 of white crystals that made no effect whatsoever.<br /><br />Ibiza this year is full of shit dealers. Wasn&#039;t so last year.

				What a bummer. I&#039;m headed there in the beginning of August and was excited about finding MDMA. Any advice for finding quality product there?<br /><br />I&#039;m half-tempted to fly with 4 Silk Road pills but am worried about dogs trained to smell mdma at the airports...any experience with that?

A ticket seller advised to buy from British guys. But it *was* a British guy (I think) who sold me those white crystals with no effect at all (0.25 g dose).<br />I&#039;ve been buying brown crystals twice from black guys. They told me that I should take half a gram. I did so first time, wasn&#039;t enough. Second time I&#039;ve took 0.75; felt pretty well, though it might be that my tolerance was in effect from previous 0.5.<br />I&#039;ve been buying it all in San Antonio.<br /><br />However, in Playa den Bossa we&#039;ve bought five pills. Three of them were Mitsubishi, quite good. But the rest two (identified later) was a moldering crap.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m half-tempted to fly with 4 Silk Road pills but am worried about dogs trained to smell mdma at the airports...any experience with that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure how it is when flying *to* Ibiza. But we were able to fly away *from* Ibiza with 1 gram of brown crystals in my luggage, 0.25 in my pocket, and some weed in my friend&#039;s luggage with no problems. We were checking in our luggage using machines.

				Thanks for the info. <br /><br />Who/where did you get the Mitsubishi&#039;s? Any tips on how to find those? I&#039;ll be staying in Playa Bossa.

On a street where Space is.<br /><br />I would advice to make them show you the pills unpacked. At least you&#039;ll see if it molders or not. And, maybe, it&#039;s worth to inspect pillreports&#039; recent reports to be ready. In San Antonio they&#039;ve sold us yellow &quot;Route 69&quot; (or 66) which appeared to be piperazine according to pillreports (inspected postfactum).

				sadly if you cant tell real MDMA from shit, or methylone, or just bunk MDMA.. imo, you need to do some more reading on the subject.
