				Im still living with my parents and the 1% chance of them getting in trouble for a drug conspiracy or even them watching me get dragged away for ordering drugs is just not a pleasant thought.<br /><br />The P.O. box is fishy cause if I pick up a package that takes away all probable deniability I have. <br /><br />Basically what im asking is &quot;How do I use an address safely that&#039;s under my name but still have anonymity.&quot; I know that&#039;s not necessarily real, but any tips/directions help!.<br />

				If you dont care about the package getting lost, use a fake name, if thats not against the rules.<br />Or use your own name and send it to a friends house<br /><br />Depends wheres your based? Your can use POSTE RESTRANTE (or however you spell it) if you&#039;re in the uk/maybe eu and can pick it up from a post office, best thing is just order in small quantities from vendors who ship discrete- look at their feedback<br /><br />Or even better ( i know you dont wanna hear this) respect your parents wishes when you live under their roof, or move out! Had to be said :p

				Look for a drop address. For instance, a neighbor that works during the day. Just wait for the package to be delivered and pick it up off the doorstep.<br /><br />I used to get stuff sent to a recently vacated house down the street. It worked out perfectly!

				^ Dude, don&#039;t do this, thats fucking horrible man imagine the neighbor works with kids or something and you get em to lose their job cause you wanted to not get caught by your parents. Get your own place, or use a p.o box. ACCEPT THIS RISK, don&#039;t try and pawn it off on someone else, its not fair on them. Though the vacant house one is a great idea and doesnt hurt anyone.

				Let a friend in on what you&#039;re doing and see if you can order to his place... Or just have stuff send to your house by friends to test if your parents would open it, and if not you&#039;ll be ok

				Find a friend. Inform friend of the risks. Pay that friend to take the risk for you.<br /><br />Some people are less risk adverse and you can pay them to recieve your packages for you.

With that said, send it to a friend like others have mentioned and let him in on it, cut him in on some of the product, or, if he&#039;s interested too, split the order with him . Let him pay half and give him a little extra for using his addy. As far as a PO box, picking up your mail is what people do. They still can&#039;t prove you ordered anything, even if you sign , thats just part of getting mail too, it proves nothing. If a package showed at my house and the mailman says, &quot;sign here&quot;:, what would the average person do? question the origin or just sign it, bring it in and see what it is. There is still plenty of plausible deny-ability.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve payed friends for drops before too. On international shipments as much as $300. When a signuatre is required, I always pay more. Domestic shipments I have given people a cut of the product or up to $100.<br /><br />I&#039;ll pay $300 to stay out of jail any day :)

				Dude, use the abandoned house or neighbor at work method.<br /><br />But if you are ordering domestically then as long as you are buying from a reputable vendor your straight.<br /><br />Ive gotten qps of weed plenty of times ,at my doorstep, no worries.<br /><br />For the PO just pay someone else to open up the box and hand you the keys, then start ordering junk mail for there name as well as the packages.<br /><br />Before you start getting alot of packages that would arouse suspicion get the person to go back to the PO and ask for a replacement key since theres was stolen when someone grabbed there purse at the beach or something<br /><br />if you open the box in your name then only go at night to pick them up, that way you can spot a stakeout better than you can during the daytime(like1am)<br /><br />I&nbsp; have 2 PO boxes in my name,a close friend has 2 in thier name (alternating big packages is a must!,you can always get away with a huge amount of small ones but big ones from the same places need time to order again to same box)<br /><br />Just listen to some people on here and use common sense!<br /><br />If you order it, it will come!

The carrier probably knows that particular house is abandon, as he or she probably NEVER delivers to said house and no one is signed up to get mail at that particular location.

				wooooo first post.<br /><br /><br />the easiest way to have a safe place to get it delivered is &quot;close to finished&quot; homes being built If the street sign is up, the mailbox is there and it has a corresponding address the post office will throw it in. No one will be the wiser.<br /><br /><br />At least in Canada**
