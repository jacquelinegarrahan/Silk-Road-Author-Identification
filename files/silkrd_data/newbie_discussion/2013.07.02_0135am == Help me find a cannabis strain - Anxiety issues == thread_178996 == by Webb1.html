				I have a fair amount of experience with cannabis, but usually when I smoke I become paranoid, self-conscious, hyper-aware of the artificiality of interactions etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s not crippling, and I&#039;ve had some fairly positive experiences, but this is the usual reaction.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big guy, but a relative lightweight with pot, too.<br /><br />Maybe it just isn&#039;t the drug for me.&nbsp; (Anxiety is an issue for me anyway -- I&#039;m speaking generally and not as a clinical diagnosis).<br /><br />But seeing the proliferation of medical strains, and the growing knowledge of different active components, I have a dream that there is a strain that would work well for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping someone can point me in the right direction.<br /><br />What I want:&nbsp; Euphoric, anxiety-reducing, body high, conducive to social interaction, laughter, pain relief; Easygoing feeling; Moderate energy -- feeling like I can do stuff.&nbsp; (I&#039;d like to try this on vacation at a lake house that is a very safe, comfortable, fun space for me.)&nbsp; The &quot;ecstasy&quot; of pot.<br /><br />What I DON&#039;T want: &quot;Couch lock&quot;; A deep mindfuck high; Anxiety; Feeling zoinked/paralyzed, zeroing in on a single thought for hours.<br /><br />I&#039;m not clear where this falls in the Sativa/Indica specturm, or if it even exists, but I&#039;m curious.&nbsp; Advice on dosing, administration (edibles? vape?) also welcome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Call this a noob question if you want.&nbsp; I have plenty of experience on the Road and with a variety of substances but I don&#039;t know much about cannabis and I&#039;ve sought the answer to this question for a long time.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Must be on SR; Price not an issue; USA domestic preferred; Looking for quality, but quality to me doesnt mean deepest mindfuck

				well i was going to say avoid sativas since they&#039;re usually worse for anxiety but they are the ones that will give you that euphoric, energetic feeling or head high. high thc:cbd ratio would give you that high but is worse for anxiety. now if i&#039;m smoking with someone paranoid i give them indica dominant but that&#039;ll put you on your arse. maybe try a relatively balanced hybrid in a vape, won&#039;t hit as hard as smoking. avoid anything crossed with blueberry.

				Hmm.&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to try a solid Indica and maybe just go easy -- it&#039;s not gonna kill me on vacation.&nbsp; Otherwise maybe a high CBD:THC cross.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Anyone else?

				I believe leafly dot com has a &#039;finder&#039; that will let you specify the characteristics you&#039;re looking for, then recommend strains based on that. Based on the things you listed I would say you will need a sativa/indicia hybrid. Basically too much indicia and it might leave you couch locked; not enough indicia and it won&#039;t have much &#039;body high&#039;.<br /><br />Also methods of ingestion might be worth looking at. Some people get a different or &#039;clearer&#039; high from edibles than from smoking.<br /><br />The list of things you said you specifically don&#039;t want, to me, seems to be best avoided by not &#039;overdoing it&#039;.<br /><br />What might work for you is to find a vendor who carries a number of strains and then order a &#039;sampler pack&#039;. Then you get a couple grams each of a bunch of different strains so you can see which works best for you, and then order just a larger amount of your favorite next time.
