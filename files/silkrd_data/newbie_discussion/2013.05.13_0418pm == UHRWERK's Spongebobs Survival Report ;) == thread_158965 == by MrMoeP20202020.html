				Hey Mate&#039;s,<br /><br />i just want to give a short report about my weekend together with Spongebob (Uhrwerk LSD ca. 115micro&#039;s)<br /><br />At first I have to say that i was told not to take more than two.... so i took two at the beginning...nearby no bitter taste so i thought it is allright...<br /><br />After approx. one hour the colours began to become brighter and more shiny.. that&#039;s when i made the mistake to think more would be better...lol (shame on me!!) <br /><br />nevertheless after 3 hours it was wonderful a lot of green and red sparks everywhere, spirals and pattern... fantastic<br /><br />But after 10 hours it really became exhausting.... and now i know&nbsp; that one weekend isn&#039;t enough time for an experience like that...it took nearby 16 hours until i could sleep...<br /><br />but me and my girlfriendare fine and we dont regret this experience !!<br /><br /><br />ABSOLUTELY TOP QUALITY !!! YOU SHOULD TRY THIS !!!<br /><br />thx to UHRWERK<br />

				told not to take two? 1 is just the tip of the ice berg my friend! i took one and had typical lsd trip with the amazing sacred geometry tattoo&#039;s all across my body! the second time around i took two and two with a mate of mine and oh my god.... &#039;<br /><br />Full blown kaleidoscopic images across my vision the sacresed geometry was clairvoyiant across my whole body as if it was scaring or white tattoo&#039;s across all of my skin, this was the most profound experience i&#039;ve ever had on lsd in my life and wouldn&#039;t trade this lsd for any other crystal i&#039;ve had my tongue touch! Im extremely thankful to uhrwerk for everything he does and cant wait to recieve my first large shipment from my good friend uhrwerk &lt;3 <br /><br />Thank&#039;s alot again buddy for connecting with me in this way much love I hope to be come closer and closer with you in the future &lt;3

				I concur with the opinions above about the quality of the Spongebob blotters. I&#039;ve taken them on a few occasions, usually in rather civilized festival settings and thus low doses. I really like using small doses of LSD as a pure party drug - for these events, just Â½ Spongebob exactly hits the sweet spot for me. A nice uplifting, stimulating push, free-flowing mental processes and still no problems behaving like a &quot;proper citizen&quot;. Never went above one of the Spongebobs yet, as I&#039;ve mostly been using LSD for this purpose this year, but one of these is a proper trip as well - with 2, I would probably stick to a more intimate setting. Really good blotters - hooray for Spongebob!<br />Uhrwerk is among my all-time preferred vendors on SR - fast, efficient, trustworthy, and a nice selection of different more or less exotic substances.
