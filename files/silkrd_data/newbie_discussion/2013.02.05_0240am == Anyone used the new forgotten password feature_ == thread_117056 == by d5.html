				I have heard of people clicking on the link and getting there successfully, but haven&#039;t tried to click it myself.&nbsp; Part of me was worried about it being a phishing scam, but there&#039;s been no evidence of that so far.&nbsp; Good luck finding your password!

				Perhaps talk to an admin asap if your a vendor because your customers may be at risk if you got hacked

				I don&#039;t think there was concern over getting hacked, was there?&nbsp; That obviously is a much greater risk.&nbsp; My understanding is the vendor changed his password, can&#039;t remember it and lost whatever it was recorded on.

				It&#039;s not a phishing scam.&nbsp; After we noticed it, I sent a message to DPR himself making sure it was intentional, and it is.&nbsp; So, there&#039;s nothing to worry about in using it.

				Ive contacted SR support through an alt account but im guessing it will take a while for a response. I dont think I have been hacked, just made a rookie error and changed it when I wasnt able to access my account frequently enough for it to stick.

				I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s not working for you -- your best bet would be to get in touch with SR Support, though I know they&#039;re always busy and it takes awhile to hear back.
