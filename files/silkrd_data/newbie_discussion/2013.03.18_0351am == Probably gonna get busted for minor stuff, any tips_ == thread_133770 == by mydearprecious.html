				Hi all, <br />I made a mistake earlier this year by asking someone in UK to send me a sample of a chemical substance. The mistake was that the substance was declared as a narcotic by the government of my country (Sweden). So now this package has been stuck at customs for over 2 months.<br /><br />What tips can you give me?<br />Anything useful to think about when contacted by police/interrogation?<br />Risk of house warrant?<br /><br />And finally, gimme your honest guess on how I&#039;m gonna end up on this!<br /><br />(For some background info: My past shows that I&#039;ve done this before, so to speak...Else I&#039;m just a regular &#039;swede&#039;)

				Don&#039;t do anything. Act like it never happened. If they call you and leave a message just ignore it, if they do get ahold of you play dumb. <br /><br />Honestly, unless it is a lot you are highly unlikely to get the cops through your door unless they truly have nothing better to do with their resources.<br /><br />That said, keep your house tidy and don&#039;t be an asshole that deserves to get a visit from the cops.

				^this. Crackistan is right. Theres nothing they can do without proof. Just pretend it didn&#039;t happen. Remember, anyone can send you anything in the mail. You don&#039;t know? Could be an angry ex girlfriend, a jealous co worker, some stalker on the internet. Your past may make them roll their eyes if they really pursue it (which they won&#039;t) and you deny.. but without any proof (thanks to the beauty of TOR) they have their their dick in their hand (and your chemical substance.. which they will probably ingest for fun. sorry.. had to) :)<br />Chill out!

				Thanks for the replies, guys!<br />Yep most of the thing u said is already counted in, so to speak.<br /><br />How about TOR activity? Can it draw any further suspicion ?<br />Also, are law enforcement able to trace my internet activity in any certain way? ... like, right now!? (playing paranoid :)<br /><br />

				Consider that address to be under watch indefinitely. If you order anything else from SR, have it shipped to a different address. Beyond that, unless you get a visit from your friendly LEO or a letter of summons, you probably have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Plus, you&#039;re in Sweden; you have one of the most humanitarian prison systems in the world, so even if you&#039;re busted, you&#039;ve got it nowhere near as bad as those of us in America or, worse still, Asia.

But the substance was declared illegal about 6 months prior to that..I completely missed that. Instantly they grabbed this package when it entered customs.<br />Sure, Sweden has good laws compared to others, US for example. It still pisses me off how the system continously forces average working ppl into criminals because of small mistakes etc..

				Always deny such things. Never talk with the police as u dont have to. They need to proof it was you who ordered. how are they supposed to do that? Everyone can use ur name an adress to use it as a drop. Take a look into truecrypt and encrypt ur hdd. and you are all set.<br /><br />To make sure they cant see u joining the TOR network, get some vpn
