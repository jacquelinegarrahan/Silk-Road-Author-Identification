				Hi<br />I&#039;ve tried a couple of U.K vendors Symbiosis wins for me for MDMA/Cocaine. In regards to pills I will be setting a vendor account today, waiting on the btc to transfer over, I will initially be selling Android pills (will be the cheapest U.K price roughly 7 gbp) and Hoffman LSD blotters. If you would like a free sample of either please message me on the forum to register your interest and I&#039;ll send you the link on the main site for the free sample.<br /><br /><br />FelixUK

				Shine69 has 60 percent and what he calls &quot;Pure&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pure is great for the money and I can&#039;t see the vendors selling grams for around £120 having gear that is so much better to be worth the extra £20.

				Ok looking at Shine69 60%<br /><br />I want some advise please guys, I have only ever had &quot;street coke&quot; that has never really done much for me in the past, a little buzz and some very mild euphoria, but nothing to write home about...<br /><br />Would 60% be similar&nbsp; to street coke and should I go for the Pure? The pure is a lot of money for me at the moment but I would be happy yo buy the 60%<br /><br />Any help or advice would be awesome<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				The way I see it, if your gonna do C, do the best you can get your hands on. I&#039;m in North America but I&#039;ve ordered from a UK vendor, Dr Col , who will be back from vacation on Wednesday if I remember right. He&#039;s got very nice C and he got me my order in lightening fast time, to America. Ordered on a Friday and up my nose on Monday, fucking A fast is what that is.<br />Good luck

				Like said above, if you want good stuff pay extra for the purer stuff. You get what you pay for. As for MDMA, i will be selling pure (purest possible crystals) made by my friend and put through numerous tests. will be selling very cheap. 25 per gram i think

I&#039;m not trashing on Shine, I&#039;m sure his high end product is pretty good, but I would consider an order from Bungee. He&#039;s not in the UK, he&#039;s in Belgium . His stealth is plenty good to not worry bout your product arriving and his C really is something special. I&#039;m in America and sometimes I just can&#039;t wait for his stuff, I might have plans that put a time-frame on the order , but , if I were closer like you are, he would be my primary supplier . It is that good . <br />Either way, enjoy!!!! I actually wish that Shine offered international shipping, I&#039;d like to sample his product. <br />
