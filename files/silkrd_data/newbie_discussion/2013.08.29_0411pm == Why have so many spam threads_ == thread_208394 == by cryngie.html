If anything it hurts you spamming people look back over your old posts and not many people like the spammers i know you wont be getting a loan from the spare coin thread if you spammed to 50

				I don&#039;t get the post limit at all. It doesn&#039;t ensure that my posts after #50 will be decent, it just makes people jump through unnecessary hoops and discourages participation on the site in general. Is that the point?

				Hi Noobs,<br /><br />I really do think that SPAM of any sort should not be tolerated.<br /><br />We ARE new members, i.e. Noobs (like it or not!) and we should:<br /><br />a) Respect the Rules<br />b) Try to give a good impression to other members, esp. Sr, Hero and Mods.<br />c) Only post with something that is worth reading.<br />d) Get to know each other (without disclosing anything incriminating!)<br />e) Promote yourself<br />f) Have Fun!<br /><br />If we all did that then we would have some great threads/discussions, reach our 50 posts quick fast and all have a laugh at the same time.<br /><br />It would sure beat all the SPAM SPAM SPAM and moaning about SPAM!<br /><br />PS - Hope y&#039;all are having a great weekend and a well earned rest&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br />

				Another suggestion: how about taking karma into the equation? A newbie with a relatively low amount of posts but which got well rated by normal members is likely to be more helpful on the other forums than someone how just writes 50 crappy spam messages. I realize that this is not likely to be available functionality of the forum software, but maybe it is not so difficult to implement.<br />

				It&#039;s a huge hassle for those who actually take the time to understand the board rules and dos and don&#039;t and get a feel for the place to be restricted to a newbie forum where there isn&#039;t really anything of interest to post in. Whether the posts are spam or not, I know that I am just posting for the sake of posting so that I can reach that magical number where I am then qualified to post in the rest of the forum. I wouldn&#039;t mind posting 10 quality posts before being able to post in the main forum, or even 20, but to set the bar at 50 and then expect quality posts isn&#039;t really a reasonable expectation when we all have our own separate lives to live.

				This issue has been discussed across multiple threads for months ever since the new rule came in. Bottom line is it is highly unlikely to be changing anytime soon so make your peace with it and move along, if you absolutely have to spam to 50 there will be a thread dedicated for that, this board however will no longer be flooded with dozens of useless spam threads.<br /><br />The quality of the threads and posts in this board has improved significantly over the months though, as more people make better use of this board and take the time reaching 50 as an opportunity to learn how to navigate SR safely we should hopefully see a safer community. <br /><br />The recent influx of newbs was strongly felt in the customer support board where some of the posts demonstrated a total lack of knowledge and awareness, everyone should read the SR wiki in it&#039;s entirety before posting here or making a purchase via the market site and I can tell you there is a large number of people rush in here with little or no care for their personal security, it&#039;s quite fucking scary.
