				Hey guys, I have been seeing a lot of posts recently that are like &quot;yeah I always get the URL off blahblah website&quot; and I think that this is just stupid because it leaves the door open for phishermen of all kinds. <br />I personally just remember 3 simple things and you should too!<br />1.silkroad<br />2.vb5<br />3.piz3r<br />seriously type it out a few times so you get in the muscle memory of it and tada! you have crushed the phishers. <br /><br />Some people click the link in a vendor&#039;s signature, some people just google sillkroad URL, some people use the hidden wiki, its all about balancing the risks and benefits.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are one of the smart ones who can remember vb5piz3r, how do you remember the forum URL?<br />dkn255hz262pmii seems a tad more difficult.<br />&nbsp;I have this saved as I usually visit it before SR and it loads faster so I would get annoyed always clicking the link from the home page of SR. <br /><br />Thanks and good luck getting your post counts up&nbsp; :)

				Hi There,<br />I too have it memorized. I am but a Newbie, and even I realize the importance of anonymity. I would hope everyone who accesses SR would use the Tor browser to protect this resource. It amazes me that people would use anything else- stupid to do that! thanks for your post.
