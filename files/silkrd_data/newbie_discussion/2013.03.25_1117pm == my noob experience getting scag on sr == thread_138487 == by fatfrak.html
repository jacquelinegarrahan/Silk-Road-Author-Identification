				i decided to try silk road.&nbsp; been off and on with junk for about 8 years.&nbsp; on mmt for the last 5 or so.&nbsp; on a very low dose, so i still like to treat myself now and again, but am not in the game enough to have good hookups, so s.r. seemed like a godsend.&nbsp; spent a little time researching it and figuring out how everything works.&nbsp; looked around the forums to see what i could find out about the different vendors.&nbsp; i&#039;ve gotten 3 orders so far.&nbsp; got smallish orders from fast forward and indubitably while i was waiting to get my long awaited order from smiles a while.&nbsp; both of the domestic orders of #4 that i got were pretty weak.&nbsp; very weak if we&#039;re being honest.&nbsp; i&#039;ve regularily gotten better dope off of the street where i live and i live in the middle of nowhere at all.&nbsp; the order that i got from saw was pretty great.&nbsp; took about a week to get instead of the 3-4 days for domestic orders, but well worth the wait.&nbsp; <br /><br />what i learned from all of this is, do your homework and go with what folks are saying.&nbsp; if everybody says there are only one or two decent vendors, then go with one of the good ones even if it costs a little more or takes a little longer.&nbsp; ends up being well worth it.

				If you are from EU, buy some of the #3 from c63amg or #3 or #4 from FrankMatthews. You will not be disappointed.

				For US #4<br /><br />I can personally recommend supremesmoke.<br /><br />I have heard dragoncove is very good but haven&#039;t tried him yet.<br /><br />For tar it sounds like Nod is the king hands down but I just do #4.<br /><br />Since this is the newbie forum I want to add:&nbsp; if you are experimenting with opioids - pills or H - always start with a very small dose and work up.&nbsp; As they all say &quot;you can always take more, but you can never take less&quot;!

				i placed an order with vladmir last tuesday night.&nbsp; he said it would go out wed am and should be there maybe by fri and def by monday if not.&nbsp; when it didn&#039;t show up mon, i logged on to see what i could find out and there was a message in my inbox from him saying that there was a mixup and it didn&#039;t go out until fri.&nbsp; ok, i was pissed, but what can you do?&nbsp; life happens and things do get screwed up sometimes.&nbsp; nevermind that this sounds an awful lot like someone elses horror story about him that i saw in either feedback or forums, i don&#039;t have anything i can do besides try to stay cool and wait, and now i have a tracking number too.&nbsp; it&#039;s now wednesday and the package not only hasn&#039;t come but i can&#039;t pull up anything with the tracking number he gave me.&nbsp; if it got mailed on friday like he says, is there any fucking way in the world that it wouldn&#039;t be updated in the postal service database by wednesday of the following week?&nbsp; am i being foolishly optimistic if i think that maybe this guy isn&#039;t fucking me around and lying to me?&nbsp; any thoughts anybody?

				you just have to wait. it&#039;s the nature of the beast. it&#039;s really shitty to try and order something with an ideal time frame in mind, because you will most likely be disappointed. I&#039;ve heard of the vendor, but I haven&#039;t heard anything bad or good about him. All you can do is extensively search the forums if you need reaffirmation.. but in the end it comes down to waiting. take your mind off of it somehow and maybe the tracking number will work in a couple days. if not, i guess it was a shot and a miss. but hey, people get screwed on a much larger scale all the time.. so try not to feel too down about it

				Looking to place a order with DRAGONCOVE for 1 gram coke b/c he states it&#039;s pure..Does anyone know if this information is correct? Like to find a regular vendor with pure coke in-order to possibly cut and resale?&nbsp; I am a newbie and this will be my initial order.Anyone have any idea what you can make off&nbsp; 3.5 pure coke costing around $450.My area normally has about 30% coke the rest cut here .

				I had good luck with Purest if you like tar.&nbsp; His stuff is way cheaper than a lot of other vendors but still pretty damn potent.

				I will bump this if it helps newbies, and add that vendor Gotsitall had very good #4 when I ordered from him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Right now he appears to be in between product but I would recommend him when he is up and running again.<br /><br />Also, I have zero experience with any of the stamp vendors.&nbsp; Better than nothing if you are sick (to state the obvious), but if you are experimenting, my gut says just avoid that scene and buy a 0.5g or 1 gram from someone that is well regarded instead.&nbsp; Again, I have never bought stamps so I am not trying to dis anyone, just the way I see it.<br /><br />Anything is better than cold copping on the street (or is it?&nbsp; I have never tried.&nbsp; Sounds like a terrible task)<br /><br />If you are bored watch that Pacino movie &quot;Panic In Needle Park&quot; it&#039;s pretty good.<br /><br />

				That tracking number issue sounds SKETCHY.<br /><br />Tracking numbers work as soon as the item is picked up from a Drop Box or dropped off at the post office.
