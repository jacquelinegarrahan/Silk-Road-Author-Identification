				Does anybody have experience with the purity of precursors and reliability of the vendors on SR? Specifically I&#039;m interested in precursors to amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, and/or MDMA. There are quite a few listings for P2NP, anybody have any experience with any of the vendors? Also, does anyone have experience with hydroxylamine or helional? It&#039;s my understanding that these are currently legal to own individually in the US, but I&#039;m sure it would bring on a lot of heat ordering it through a traced transaction. What is the forum&#039;s take on this?<br /><br />Also, where the heck are vendors selling Papaver somniferum pods? I would expect there to be more than one vendor since the seeds are legal and easy to come across. I would grow them myself, but don&#039;t have the climate nor the real estate to do so. I&#039;ve sourced from various US based businesses online before, after all the pods are legal to use for flower arrangements. However, their prices have gotten to the point of absurdity and I&#039;m sure someone with a bit of land to grow on could make a killing selling Papaver somniferum pods in the US/CA, especially since it&#039;s legal (as long as you aren&#039;t suspected of extracting opium from them).

				Helional and hydroxylamine are the two &quot;hard to source&quot; precursors for MDA synthesis - I think. I&#039;m not a huge fan of ketamine, but MDA is another story. I really hope that these precursor listings are legitimate, I could make ~5 purchases and be set for life...
