				I&#039;m curious what people&#039;s strategies are to discuss drugs with their peers? I&#039;m not a big distributor or anything, I just don&#039;t want to ask my friends, &quot;hey you want to come over and smoke some pot&quot; when I have drugs arriving in my mail.

				The devil is in the details....<br /><br />No need to be so specific in my opinion.. a simple &quot; hey buddy whats doing. wanna come chill at mine?&#039; will have much the same result but is nothing out of the ordinary.. just a mate asking a mate around to chill...<br /><br />you have the right idea by being aware of the dangers and that even though you may not be doing anything serious doesn&#039;t mean that a fri3end isn&#039;t or whatever.. so kudos..<br /><br />golden rule and the rule that will keep you free(ish) is never say anything via text/email or phone that you wouldn&#039;t be ok with being printed in the news paper... sure you will find there are times wires are crossed and it costs you a little time here or there but better than the shit load of time it could cost you if the wrong cop sets his targets on you...<br /><br />Just cause I&#039;m paranoid doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t out to get me.. they fucking are out to get EVERYONE... sure as my ass points to the ground<br /><br />;-P

				If they are your friends, surely you can just straight up ask them. If not then you need to drop subtle hints for a while, they will eventually catch on and then they may ask to smoke with you themselves.

				Hahhahahahahahaha<br /><br />yeah Video and Phot evidence is fairly conclusive in the eyes of most people... and on your phone is like carring around a little box that has EVIDENCE written on the side and contains all the evidence a cop needs to justify releasing you of the burden of liberty and such..<br /><br />&quot;No your honour thats not me smoking a bong while insufflating coke and IV&#039;ing meth in that picture... no that would be my evil twin bother.. his name? ummm Frank ... Charlie Frank.. &quot; <br /><br />but seriously yeah be so careful with that sort of stuff.. think GPS caching, meta data, reflections that reveal details about you etc etc.. and its a honey pot for the cops so they always go for peoples phones.. well down here they do anyway.. so the trafic stop can lead to the picture found on the phone which then leads to a search of your home and the tearing apart of the messages/numbers etc on your phone... all because you had a picture of the Mnt Everist of shards or whatever

				I&#039;d probably avoid doing it at all--especially if you&#039;re selling or holding a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Otherwise, if it&#039;s just for personal use. Tell your friends in person. Then you can ask them online if they want to come over and chill or hang out.&nbsp; They&#039;ll know.

				Ya, my current strategy is just for them to &quot;come over for a few minutes&quot; or &quot;drop by and say hi&quot;. But it&#039;s difficult to find a way to say &quot;sorry, I&#039;m all out of pot until Tuesday&quot; without actually saying it. I usually just say something to the effect of, &quot;I&#039;ve been super busy and haven&#039;t restocked on anything recently so I&#039;m going grocery shopping soon&quot; but the problem is that I&#039;m not sure if they want to partake in ganja or one of the other substances I keep around. And I definitely never take any photos and I don&#039;t let anyone photograph me while ingesting illicit substances.

				As far as your friends are concerned you are receiving an ordinary package.&nbsp; I do not believe you should ever mention SR to anyone or that you even know about it.&nbsp; Silk Road? What&#039;s that?&nbsp; As for pictures, I believe imgur automatically cleans them of any data linking the picture to you.&nbsp; Also, letting anyone know you keep lots of illegal substances, and where you keep them is to me, not a bright idea.

				Tor just isn&#039;t secure on phones from what I gather. Besides, by the very nature of the way they&nbsp; connect into a tower there is just too many ways that LE could take advantage of this. Encryption is the safest way to communicate on anything but even these options have limitations... at the very heart is the human factor of picking a key for decryption and the common mistakes made by people at that level... <br /><br />A dedicated Android running Linux/tails and tor with PGP ( achievable last I checked) would solve a lot of the issues I think but again its a gamble and the stakes are too rich for my blood...

				Lol...<br /><br />its available right now...<br /><br />Dragon Naturally Speaking + Netbook or whatever with (two turn tables and ...) a microphone... where its at?? <br /><br />haha just kidding but seriously ignore the post from the dude above about&nbsp; who said something along the lines of<br /><br />&#039;if your not selling... blah blah be loose selfish cunt&#039; <br /><br />these statements just confirm the long held belief that if you take any group within a population, regardless of the source of the people, you will have at least one dick who has no idea what they are talking about but still feel obligated (and entitled) to state whatever tard like advice they can dream up that sounds good.. there will be no care factor about how a simple, ill informed and poorly worded&nbsp; off handed piece of &quot;advise&quot; can send someone right down the express lane to a shit life, your new one, in a cement and iron box...&nbsp; and there are 2 reasons to file that (hopefully) mental retard&#039;s little pearl of wisdom under &#039;selfish arrogant asshole advise&#039; and they are as follows;<br /><br />1) I can say with absolute certainty and without any doubt at all that just because you don&#039;t sell or whatever DOESN&#039;T (DOES NOT) mean the drug pigs won&#039;t scoop you up for the conviction etc for their quota and if you make it easy for them by being loose then really you kinda deserve the world of pain that is the reality of criminal charges and convictions and the unmistakable horror when you realize you have lost your FREEDOM.. let that sink in... you will not be free to do as you please... you will be essentially under the absolute command of some corrections officer... you know the fat idiot who failed at being a cop/soldier or whatever and is now paid to make your day&nbsp; &#039;ordered&#039;&nbsp; ...... I have said it before and a fellow forum member confirmed it (ex LEO.. seems like a good dude who gets the damage that&#039;s being done to our species through these draconian prohibition laws and their enforcement) The cops are funded and have jobs solely due to the stupid money that is tipped onto enforcement of the drug laws and most actually believe that by getting you and you 1/8th of weed will mean one less criminal on the streets and the community safer because of it... about on par with robbers and violent criminals&nbsp; you are in their minds and if its a chemical you have when they nab you, well, your worse than a murderer&nbsp; if thast chemical has lets say&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 odd carbon atoms with maybe 15 Hydrogen atoms and a&nbsp; lazy Nitrogen atom (that&#039;s good ol meth btw.. well the chemical formula for it... C10H15N)&nbsp; and fuck me you must be the reincarnate of Hitler...&nbsp; ..&nbsp; but the cops... really trust me here... They want you, they need you and give them any help and, as sure as my ass points to the ground, they will have you...<br /><br />2) even if all of the above it rubbish spouted from the twisted mind of a person who has 20+ years of experience with buying, selling, making and enjoying illicit drugs and they never ever ever will come after you (usually they ring to tell you this right after you win Powerball and you realize your shitting rainbow sherbert that smells like candy floss... sometime its a day after you find a suitcase with unmarked, non sequential $100 bills in it and a day or two before you get your &#039;drug taker of the year&#039; award from the commissioner of police... seriously though.. ) that&#039;s not a&nbsp; reason to fuck your dealer, friends, associates etc by giving Intel to the po-po through loose talks on the phone... its takes a little bit of foresight but take the scenario where you just got your gear from your dude and you ring a mate to swing past yours to partake in the shenanigans... LE either has your guys comms under watch and by extension your number too or have been tipped by some fukwit &#039;citizen&#039; that just happened to hear you say the words &#039;getting high&#039; or whatever and so knows you must be involved in Outlaw MC clubs and the Russian Mafia just like all the naughty drug users are.. but you rang from your number when you called your old mate and they already have a clue about them and their &#039;associates&#039; so they have everything they need to be able to legally intercept your comms too now and can even stretch you being a customer into you being a member of their syndicate whos on sells to a small group of customers.. .. never mind though you think... &#039;I&#039;m just derp getting my smash on so what the fuck can they get from me.. haha the poor cunt assigned to my shit is going to die of boredom&#039;... but&nbsp; in the Mean-styles the snorts and sequels of excitement can be heard for miles as this little piggy goes to court to get a &#039;blow your house down&#039; warrant on your dudes house cause they now have you on phone telling a mate &#039;come get a smah on me bro.. its dank shit too man... yeah I&#039;ll be back home in halfa so meet you there&#039; and just like that you gave up your dude, enough cause to get a search warrant just because of the call to your dude and the call to your mate?? lol fuck loads man (we think &#039;helping a mate out and sharing costs on bulk to save but they see trafficker, distribution branch and so on).. those special DEA closed courts dedicated to these types of &#039;secret&#039; intercept warrants and search and seize warrants just think that this all proves how brain dead the users are and makes the victory all the more sweet... and when you step back and see the situation as they see it unfolding (in a linear fashion from our perspective but from the external observer its a much larger multifaceted series of events and interactions that build the picture for them and tells them everything they need to know about who supplies who, what you like to partake in.. shit even what you had for breakfast...) you understand just how easy we make it for them sometimes <br /><br />Saddest of all is that the &#039;part timers&#039; and low level users are the ones trapped by this sort of shit cause the full timers&nbsp; have seen the operations being run for 2+years to nab a weed and meth dealer who is really just a low level distributor who does it to support a habit and felt the weight of the 1200+ pages of text messages that are evidence (that&#039;s 1 phone number and one pair of people too btw.. totals can be a lot more than that and seen the 15 armed and angry cops as they invade a mates home.. at least the dogs (sniffer) where friendly(ish) so the 3 of them softened the hurt.. yeah right...<br /><br />Itas not a &#039;game&#039; as many say it is, its not a way of survival for the police like it is for us and one fuck up is all it takes to have your world flipped upside down and those demons on your shoulder every day and especially every time you see a blue uniform...&nbsp; At least you will meet a diverse range of people from cvariedf ethnic groups in lock up.. taste the flavour of all the 5 continents and they will love you and your rainbow sherbet shit...<br /><br />I&#039;m only a dick with these sorts of posts cause I actually care about the freedoms of even the tards that take everything for granted and I hope that some sharp words and a forked tongue will get the point across with a little impact.. hopefully you will hate me but not be another victim of the war... Seriously think of me calling you a retarded, window licking muppet every time you think its ok to say anything on a phone and I pray it stops you having that moment of clear, terrifying realization... you are sitting with no shoe laces on, locked in a box smaller than some bird cages while staring at the cement roof ignoring, trying to, the keys giggling up and down the corridor attached to belt with the Tazer, spray, firearm, hand cuffs carried by the brain dead automiton who if not a cop would be under qualified working on a factory floor stamping boxes.. that dude OWNS you too now BTW... IQ &lt;15 but clearly still smarter than one person in the room O_O=[*] (yup I&#039;m looking at you Mr Iphone(d) my way to jail)..<br /><br />:-D..<br /><br /><br />

				Don&#039;t text incriminating shit what ever you do. Wire taps happen so rarely talking is not as big as a deal unless the person you&#039;re talking to is trying to set you up, either way you&#039;re probably going to be fucked IMO. With texts though your friend could loose his phone and then whatever is stored in it is at the mercy of them. Also, texts can be read of in court.

				I think the best policy if you have even the slightest reason to think you&#039;re being monitored is to use burner phones to arrange face-to-face meetings and never send an unencrypted e-mail or text. Be vague and say as little as possible. Never refer directly to drugs. Even if you don&#039;t think anybody is listening, you still shouldn&#039;t talk directly about illegal activity. Just use your tone of voice to imply what you mean. <br /><br />Also, code words are only useful for fooling parents, teachers, American voters and other people who don&#039;t really listen in the first place. Any moron can figure out what you&#039;re talking about regardless of how creative you are if they already know what they&#039;re looking for. And code words do not give you any plausible deniability in court, they just make you look like a criminal.

				I just say common shit like, &quot;Hey dude, let&#039;s get some pizza. Hit me up.&quot; It&#039;s a custom all my friends have taken in. If we ever actually want to go get pizza we just state a specific place. It&#039;s worked flawlessly. Not even my strict Mormon parents caught on during my teenage years.

				There are many secure ways to communicate over the phone with your friends.<br /><br />Firstly, landlines can be tapped very easily. There are two wires, the ring and the tip, that anyone with a redbox can hook up to the side of your house, and listen in on your calls. (Even make phone calls.)<br /><br />This is why I use my Apple iPhone 5s.<br />It uses ROT-13 encryption when connecting to the cellular tower.<br />Now since the FBI can monitor cell towers, I like to go in public places like malls and such.<br />There is safety in numbers, remember? The feds will have a really really hard time tracking down so many people.<br />And I just talk.<br />&quot;Yo WAZZUP mai Nigga&#039;, you wanna slam some eitch?&quot;<br />I talk like every other black man in my all white-rich people mall.<br />Reason for this, I&#039;m white. Not black. Nobody will ever suspect me.<br />I also yell really loudly, nobody will ever believe me.<br /><br />When friends actually come over, we do it in the dumpster behind the local police station.<br />They NEVER check there. EVER.<br />Who would be sutpid enough to shoot up eitch behind a police station?<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve never been caught, and I am relatively safe, If I do say so myself.

				it may seem stupid but if youre serious and just want to take every precaution,<br /><br />bring in your guys who you would normally be texting this sensitive info to <br />and just strait up tell them you need to devise a <br />way of efficiently communicating via phone. <br /><br />like that scene in &quot;Casino&quot; 1995 (Pesci and Deniro) where they talk code <br />its pretty cool

				I&#039;ve always been a fan of codewords. &quot;Candy&quot; [LSD], &quot;gardening&quot; [pot], &quot;Mario&quot; [shrooms], any phrase that you and your friends can agree upon beforehand. You can never be too careful, especially in the States.<br /><br />I&#039;d highly recommend making plans in person beforehand, though, instead of using the phone or email.
