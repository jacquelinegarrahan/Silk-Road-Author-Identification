You wouldn&#039;t make much profit if any. I&#039;d recommend buying a bulk of MDMA overseas, cutting it up, and selling it as molly. It&#039;s easier, it could make you 100x the profit, and molly is the spotlight drug of most places right now. Heres what you&#039;d get for selling MDMA and Coke<br /><br />High purity non cut cocaine - 100-150$ <br /><br />That would be ~84% pure cocaine. Cut it 50/50 to have 2 grams of cut cocaine. You&#039;d have to sell it for 50-75$ a gram to break even. 42% pure cocaine would not sell very well on the streets at that price.<br /><br />Pure MDMA (Overseas) - 30$-40$<br /><br />That woud be ~84% pure MDMA. Cut it 50/50 and sell it for 60-100$ a gram, you&#039;ll make 50$+ in profits. People happily pay those prices for molly half as pure as that!!!

				Yes they work great for tattoos.&nbsp; The patches are pretty big they measure 6 1/2&quot; x 8&quot; (10cm x 14cm).&nbsp; The lidocaine is released for 12 hours.

				I just made a special Tattoo healing 5 patch listing for just $14.&nbsp; Five patches will offer 2 1/2 days of constant lidocaine application to decrease swelling, healing time, and will help the tat hold more color as it heals.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should know I&#039;ve been using them on tats for 8 years!&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to spend the money for a tattoo, you&#039;d be smart to pay a little bit more for a product that will maximize your tattoo&#039;s color and definition.&nbsp; Each patch covers 10 cm × 14 cm (6 1/2&quot; x 8&quot;).<br /><br />My store listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c537122af2
