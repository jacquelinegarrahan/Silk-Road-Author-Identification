				I&#039;m sure if anyone got hit in the head while being attacked, they would fear for their life enough to shoot their assailant.&nbsp; The case also lost its racial momentum that the media was pushing for when everyone found out that Zimmerman was Colombian. I&#039;m pretty sure that all the background bullshit that usually pushes cases over the edge of ridiculousness stopped after everyone found out that he is hispanic and not white.

				I&#039;m with thelorax on this one.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t following this case hardly at all.&nbsp; Might have watched a little bit about it on TV a few days back for 5 or 10 minutes enough to learn that Zimmerman was all bloody when the cops showed up.&nbsp; Unless he beat himself up or something I think it&#039;s pretty obvious he was acting in self defense as Martin attacked him.&nbsp; I&#039;m probably lacking a lot of the facts but from my brief exposure to this case I just had the feeling he was going to get off.&nbsp;

				Just gotta trust the jury did right - they spent weeks analyzing the case whereas I&#039;m just browsing SR for some things.<br /><br />Not super surprised if Zimmerman told the truth - got attacked and had to shoot in self-defense.<br /><br />Who knows though man.

				Vendors shouldnt be voicing their opinions. <br /><br />But I need to get to post 50.<br /><br />I feel that cases like this and many other ones like it are just distractions. Distracting us from the real issues like our freedoms and privacy being stripped away from us. <br />

				NOt surprising at all. The prosecution didnt have much of a case and the defense did a good job. Manslaughter was really the only chaance.

				I followed this one pretty closely - the case was all about race politics - had to charge him even if there wasn&#039;t any evidence he was guilty - even the detective investigating the case said on the stand he found zimmerman&#039;s version credible<br /><br />the police chief of sanford was forced to resign cause he wouldn&#039;t charge zimmerman without the necessary evidence - <br /><br />and the national media made it about race when they conveniently left out verbage from their reporting of his 911 audio tape - they reported he said &quot;I think he&#039;s black&quot; referring to trayvon - they left out that the dispatcher had asked him, can you tell the individual&#039;s race?, and that was when he responded re martin&#039;s race<br /><br />fwiw - think zimmerman the racist, the wannabe cop, whatever - this whole thing boils down to kids not having respect for adults or their elders - he&#039;s walking between buildings on his way to his father&#039;s house (where he doesn&#039;t ordinarily reside) and someone&#039;s watching him - the guy&#039;s a community watch officer, that&#039;s what he&#039;s supposed to do. I&#039;d never think to or confront someone older than me the way martin did, when i was 17 - had he been taught NOT to be confrontational, he&#039;d be alive - but NOT having been taught to be non-confrontational, he went fult tilt the other way - WHO IS THIS WHITE ASS CRACKER TO FOLLOW ME and he took it to zimmerman<br /><br /><br />and crawling my way to that magic 100

				Both where wrong in this instance zimmerman was a cunt cop wannabe and trayvon was a thug who brought skittles to a gun fight. Trayvon also started the fight, dumbass! All he had to do was keep walking home and this shit woulda never happened but he decided to confront zimmerman.

				Prosecution should have gone for manslaughter, but tried to jump the shark as it was a national story.&nbsp; Zimmerman was guilty of overkill, could&#039;ve shot Trayvon in the leg or ass then tossed the gun aside and waited for cops. What I would have done... scratch that! I would have never stuck my neck out and called cops like jackass did in the first place. Wouldn&#039;t of gotten taken down and mounted by a light weight 17 yr old either.
