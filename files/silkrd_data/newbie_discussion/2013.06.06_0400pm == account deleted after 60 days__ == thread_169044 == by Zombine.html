				Hey guys, I have a cocern about my account that maybe y&#039;all vets can help me out with. I was away for the past 2 months and when I came back to silk road my account login won&#039;t work. Is there an account inactivity trigger? I tried searching this topic with no avail. Are all my bitcoins and buyer stats gone forever??!!! :-\

				It is either 30 or 60 days of inactivity. (without logging on) Your account will be deleted after that point. Just make a new one with the same name. Maybe it hasn&#039;t been taken yet<br />

				Notify SR support. You may be able to gain access again to it. Maybe it is just saved for another period of time, but, removed from being able to access it. Or maybe you can instruct them to delete it permanently so you can reopen the account. <br /><br />These are all my educated guesses though.

				I thought an account will only be deleted if it is inactive for xx days AND if there are no coins left in the wallet? <br /><br />edit: quoted from SR wiki:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Will my account be deleted for inactivity?<br /><br />Accounts with zero balance will be archived if not logged into for several months. If you suspect your account has been archived, try creating a new user with the same name. If you cannot, then the account still exists. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

If you entered your login details (especially if it asked for your PIN) at any other URL other than silkroadvb5piz3r.onion then it is likely your account has been phished. If that is the case, please see the following entry on the SR Wiki:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I_forgot_my_passphrase.<br /><br />Libertas

				Keep a few cents worth of money in your SR wallet so that doesn&#039;t happen again. I learned something new here and plan to do the same since i do not use this site all the time.
