				I mean this in the nicest possible way, as the reviewers posted by users are the single best source of info for other users. While you have to liberally apply the &quot;shill filter&quot; and the &quot;vendor posting as a user filter&quot;, it&#039;s extremely valuable info to people looking to follow in your footsteps and buying from the same vendor.<br /><br />While I don&#039;t post very often on the forums (and the &quot;spam to 50&quot; thing just makes me shake my head), I&#039;ve made quite a few orders on SR (40+, 100B+). I actively research what people say about a particular vendor or product first, so what gets said by the buyers is very important. <br /><br />Here are a couple friendly tips to people posting reviews, from the perspective of someone trying to make a buying decision:<br /><br />1. First three rules of vendor assessment are quality, quality, quality.<br />2. If there is a significant issue regarding stealth, feedback, or delivery problems, absolutely mention them. But generally most vendors are pretty good on both stealth and delivery. If you don&#039;t mention them, readers will simply assume it was good stealth, good delivery, good customer service.<br />3. But what readers of your reviews REALLY want to know is what the product is like. Anything talking about how it looked, made you feel, any test results, how your friends liked it, etc. is invaluable - this is what we as readers focus right in on. The more the better in this regard. Anything you can add (congestion, feeling the next day, jonesing, finger test, EZ test, bleach test, etc) is great.<br />4. Posts/reviews that say &quot;the stealth was great and the customer service was awesome. Haven&#039;t tried the product but sure it&#039;s great too&quot; is not very useful. We of course want to know the vendor is on the ball, ships quickly, and handles things well. These are important. But all those pale in comparison with the quality of what they&#039;re delivering. Because cocaine (and many other substances on SR) are just white powdery substances that are basically impossible to tell if they are quality stuff by looking at it, saying &quot;I&#039;m sure it&#039;s great&quot; is misleading (I&#039;ve been using for 20 years and have decided you simply can&#039;t tell by looking). Good shipping and good customer service does not equal quality product - there&#039;s no correlation and sometimes an inverse one. This doesn&#039;t mean hold off on finalizing until you test it if that&#039;s going to be a couple days - the vendors really need that cash to operate. If you got it, pay for it. But if you haven&#039;t tried it yourself, don&#039;t comment on your guess on quality just because it&#039;s a shiny white powder if you honestly have no clue what the quality is like. Just finalize, say &quot;great stealth, great service, see forums for opinion&quot; - then post your opinion on the forums later. We will find it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want this to dissuade anyone from making comments, since like I said, user comments are absolutely helpful to buyers. Just avoid posting about how the vendor is 10/10/10 if you haven&#039;t tried the product. I guarantee all the readers are just skimming through the stealth/shipping/PM narrative of your response info to get to the taste test. Few buyers say to themselves &quot;don&#039;t care if it&#039;s any good, just want to know it ships fast in a pretty box!&quot; :)<br /><br />Following my own advice, I&#039;m going to start doing this as well, and hope it helps out!<br /><br />

				I couldnt agree more, quality is the most important thing to mention in a review, delivery time to me in fairly important, and then mentioned if you got dicked around at all.&nbsp; But ya quality is super important and gets left out a lot.

				I like your advice.<br /><br />Once you finalize, you do not need to instantly rate or review (currently). This means you can give the vendor their hard earned btc, but wait until you have a better idea of the quality of the product to make a more useful review.<br /><br />As you said, forums are great too.

				Absolutely, and that goes for any Drug. I scroll through pages of generic reviews &quot;Great Vendor, I got it in the mail in 3 days!&quot; No shit you got it, fucking tell me what the product was like you asshole
