				Ok&nbsp; hi Im new. Any help would be apreciated. I dont have torrent. Im accessing this website through an &quot;onion&quot; website.&nbsp; So in the AM I will go and add bitcoins through&nbsp; bitinstant-zipzap and that will be transferred to my bitstamp wallet.. once that is in the wallet how do I go about making a purchase through SR?

				Didn&#039;t see a reason to start a new thread when I needed some help to. I have been lurking on silk road for a while now but this will be my first post on this account, and first attempt at actually buying/ selling on the SR using bitcoins. My question is why can&#039;t I find my SR wallet bitcoin address. even after following this - &quot;account page will have a link that says &quot;Click here to make a deposit&quot;. The page that link leads to is where you will find your SR wallet bitcoin address.&quot; There is no link on my account page.

				I feel like I&#039;m retarded but I understand what the receiving address should look like it&#039;s the fact that I can&#039;t find it anywhere. I&#039;ve read and read haha&nbsp; :P

				Check out the Silk Road Wiki.<br />It&#039;s actually really food for people just starting out. It&#039;s got an abundance of useful information for both new buyers and sellers.<br />:)
