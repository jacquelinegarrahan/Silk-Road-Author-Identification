				I was wondering how one checks the balance on their reload it card. Someone gave me their card that still had some money on it but I have no idea how to check it. Also, is it possible for someone to empty a card out without knowing how much is on it? Thanks!

I just got one of those with the numbers texted to me and the dollar amount. My only concern was the last 4 digits were 0000. Don&#039;t wanna bug family member since they were kind enough to help out in time of need. Called 800 number and they won&#039;t give out balance, or even confirm that it is active card. No pay-pal, no CC. Gonna have to call family member before i try to trade it for some coin unless somebody has a way to check that i haven&#039;t thought of.
