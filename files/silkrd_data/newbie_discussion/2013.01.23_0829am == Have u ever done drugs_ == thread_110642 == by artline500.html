				well a few months ago I was at my friend&#039;s house and they keep this strange painkiller called &quot;Advil&quot; around, we all took 1 extra strength (300mg ibuprofen), and we were having so much fun.. Anyway im gonna go trick a doctor into prescribing me it. I also want to try aspirin and tylenol one time, I heard tylenol kicks in the fastest.

				I did a lot of old school drugs for years, but recently I found something that topped everything. I saw colors in such great various, sounds I can&#039;t describe, a feeling that was like WOOOOW is this really happening. It was being in a dream but i was sure I was not sleeping.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really remember how my guy called I think it was something like Relty and he called it being srober or soba, don&#039;t know.<br /><br />You must try this....

				Have never done drugs in my life, I just love taking some time off from my busy day and waste it on Tor and browsing through SR. All those pretty little things they offer are so fun to look at, it&#039;s like a web museum. I love how so many awesome shit like cigarettes and fake roxicodones make the front page as featured items too!! PURE AWSOMENESS
