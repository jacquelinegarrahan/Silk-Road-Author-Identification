				Just wanted to let everyone know I recently purchased an ID from FLidsales and I know how most forgery/ID vendors are unreliable so I just thought I would let everyone know that this guy is definitely legit.<br /><br />It took a while to come, about two and a half weeks, but due to recent scams, he has had a huge amount of orders so I definitely do not blame the guy. When I first opened it I thought it was a joke or something, like he sent me some old real ID with some random person&#039;s face on it. It looks so much better than any of my friends&#039; and I couldn&#039;t believe the quality. No bubbles in the laminate, no mistakes in the name or address, has a clear overlay on the back like real Florida IDs, everything is perfect. I haven&#039;t been able to test if it scans yet but many other reviews confirm that it does so I am not worried about that.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for an ID vendor, he is definitely a good choice. All he has right now is Florida I think but he has numerous states that he&#039;ll be making soon and a few Canadian provinces. He communicated a lot throughout the process and was always very polite. Definitely top quality, he&#039;s just been getting a few bad reviews because of how long the orders have taken. Be patient, he has a lot of orders and soon he will get into a good rhythm, but these IDs are good!
