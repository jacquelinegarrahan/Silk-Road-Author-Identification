				Do you always receive a letter informing you if your package has been seized? If so, is your address now permanently &#039;flagged&#039; or is it safe to make more orders to this address? Should I just stick to domestic?<br />UK resident by the way.

				yes you do receive a letter informing you that he has been seized it is the law&nbsp; but cops usually take a long time before giving notice because they want to seize more,your address will obviously be flagged so I d advise you to change your drop address<br />also you should receive the package (without drugs)with a stickers on it mentinonning the content&nbsp; has been seized<br />the package itself isnt illegal therefore if they dont send it back to you it is theft<br />depending on the quantity the process can take up to a month<br />small amount you generally get informed within 5 days

				for me i got a package that was opened and a customs declaration on it saying stuff inside was seized <br />so i went to police gave a declaration that i never ordered stuff from the Netherlands and i didn&#039;t understand why i recieved a package<br />and&nbsp; heard of them again&nbsp; 6 months later i recieved info that the case against me was dropped as in lack of evidence<br />But remember deny everything when you get such letters or packages with customs declaration on it <br />they can&#039;t prove you ordered the package so the case will always drop <br /><br />Edit my adress was flagged but just stopped ordering drugs for 6 months and started to spam my mailbox with stupid stuff like cheap things of ebay and since then i never recieved a custom or police letter&nbsp;
