				hey all.....can someone lead me in the rite direction for some good quality weed.....would prefer large amounts possible, also im after hash/oil prefer the oil.....if anyone has any off this please send me a message or reply here....even if u only know the vendor please let me know as im wanting ONLY quality weed and if it can be done i would like large amounts or i will settle for small amounts depending on the Variety, been a smoker for 15 years so i expect the best as im also willing to pay for it...&nbsp; if ur prices are stupidly high just walk away but if u can give me a fruity price will be all happy :)&nbsp; estimate i would be need around 2 p a month atm of fruity weed....the vendor must know the Variety and packaging/stealth must be up to scratch......hope i hear from some helpful peoplel;D

				The Australian cannabis market has A LOT of untapped potential in my opinion. But right now, it is not that great.<br />When I first joined SR I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to source cheaper LB&#039;s from different states myself and cut out the middle man. I am yet to find someone that can even come close to matching what I get for a LB IRL! (with the exception of 1stopoz who sold me quite a cheap LB although the quality was so/so, not shit, but not what im used to)<br /><br />I am also interested if someone can do this. Strain name does not matter to me, but constant variety is what I am used to even if its just a rotation of commercial strains.<br /><br />I am not complaining about the smaller consumer market or the larger wholesale market, SR offers an abundance of clientele and low barrier to entry. It is far from a monopoly so if you don&#039;t like the prices, set up shop and show em hows it&#039;s done :D
