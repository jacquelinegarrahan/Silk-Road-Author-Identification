				Hello,<br /><br />I am a newbie to SR. I have made several purchases so far. Along with of course the immediate desire of stimulation, I also believe in a free society. This is a great place, and ran very well. It&#039;s beautiful. <br /><br />I&#039;m mostly a lurker, but I have to register if only to explain some things. There are a few very smart guys who have made comments with their knowledge of IT, and of course the staff is too busy to really bother explaining so I want to explain a couple of things.&nbsp; Some of the things I have read are cringe worthy. I also haven&#039;t found any explanation to the layman for what is potentially occurring. <br /><br />Going to a website (SR for example) is the process of your computer:<br /><br />&nbsp;1) Sending Information<br />&nbsp;2) Getting information for the best route to take to the destination (SR webserver) <br />&nbsp;3)Traveling that route <br />&nbsp;4) Changing routes as instructed by networking protocols<br />&nbsp;5) Reaching Destination <br />&nbsp;6) &quot;Handshaking&quot; with the destination (webserver)<br />&nbsp;7)Delivering payload.<br /><br />These are sent in units called packets.&nbsp; As you can see, sending a packet from one point, to another (client&gt;server in our case) Goes through a lot of different points in it&#039;s life. Travel between each point is a potential for this packet to be sniffed, diverted, ignored etc.&nbsp; With that said, even if your packet reaches it&#039;s destination, the device that sent the packet, has no clue if it reached it or not. When the &quot;Handshake&quot; occurs typically the receiving networking device will send another packet in return to let the sending know that it was received in the first place.&nbsp; This means that a packet could reach it&#039;s destination, but you have no clue.<br /><br />A caveat to be mentioned is that since we go through TOR, TOR works as a middle (proxy) for this traffic.&nbsp; I am not a networking specialist, but basically when information is sent, if properly configured the data will enter into TOR&quot;s network where it is anonymized etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason that a TOR site is slower than a clearweb site is because the relays handling this job aren&#039;t massive networking operating centers like an internet backbone, and it just takes time. <br /><br />A DoS (Denial of Service) attack is not typically considered hacking. It is not a crash of the destination server, or anything else. It is merely the exploitation of TCP/IP&#039;s many weaknesses. A DoS attack is when a network capable device, maliciously sends so many requests for information to a target server that some point, in the previously aformentioned route that traffic traveling to that target server, doesn&#039;t reach it&#039;s destination.&nbsp; &nbsp;The packets you send are refused, because the malicious packets of an attacker are taking up resources by being flooded.&nbsp; A DoS isn&#039;t like hitting refresh on your browser over and over, that&#039;s not nearly fast enough. They are typically programs (easy to create) made that send junk data over and over and over again.&nbsp; This ties up one of the points a packet would take from point A to point B. Typically the bottleneck would be the actual webserver as internet backbones can handle massive amounts of traffic, but since it&#039;s TOR we aren&#039;t really utilizing internet backbones. Smaller relays may not be able to handle these requests either. <br /><br /><br />A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Is the same as above, except from multiple devices and locations for maximum potency. Typically with a DDoS there is also the potential to crash the target server (Every request requires some part of that servers resources). <br /><br />I&#039;ll leave it at that, I can get much deeper if anyone has any questions. The concept is simple, but under the hood is more complicated than your typical layman cares to know. <br /><br />DoS attacks are a pain in the ass to deal with because it&#039;s hard to discern what is legit traffic from what is illegitimate. Being behind TOR makes this process much harder I&#039;d believe as well. DPR mentioned that we are dealing with leading edge anonymity technology because dealing with a DDoS in the open is no mystery, DoS attacks are simple and old as the modem, but doing it within the environment of a ToR is probably intense, and certainly beyond my level of networking and security. <br /><br />What ISN&#039;T a DoS?&nbsp; It&#039;s not a hack, it&#039;s not cracking into a database and stealing your information. It&#039;s not gaining root access to a webserver, it&#039;s nothing elegant. It&#039;s merely exactly what the name is, a Denial of Service.&nbsp; On the contrary, since it is being DoS&#039;d nobody, even a potential hacker is getting in. Packets don&#039;t wear a wizard hat of any color. <br /><br />I&#039;m bored does anyone have any questions?<br />
