				Hey there,<br /><br />So Sunday night I made a domestic order at around 8ish (when the site was slightly working), I then woke up the next morning and the SR was down and haven&#039;t been able to access it since due to the attack. <br />I was wondering what were the chances of my order being shipped out?? <br />Or is is more likely that the vendor didnt even recieve the order in the first place since its been down?<br /><br />Anyways its now Tuesday and I haven&#039;t recieved anything (I paid for Express) Also my first time buying so im just trying to find someone who will give me a realistic answer<br />Thanks!&nbsp; :)

				Some seller, have it where they get more money if bitcoins rise.&nbsp; Liston does this.&nbsp; He will sit on your order for almost two weeks and if the price crashed, he cancels your order.&nbsp; When it goes up, he sends it out next day or promises you extra if you FE that day.&nbsp; Here is my experience with him:<br />Probably, but if is from Liston, then just don&#039;t complain no matter how bad he screws you.<br />Liston stated that he would and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...

				Only the vendor or time will tell.<br /><br />Either your order was received and shipped out, but not marked as in transit due to downtime, which in this case should still arrive.<br />Or it was just never received and never shipped out, in which case your order is still sitting there waiting to be viewed and processed.<br /><br />Unfortunate for you, bad timing. <br /><br />There is a good chance your order hasnt been processed, the site has been down for a long time now and vendors are unable to conduct their business as normal. <br /><br />If you&#039;re lucky, a brief moment of up-time since then might have had your order viewed but not posted until today, so fingers crossed it arrives tomorrow, but I dont want to get your hopes up...
