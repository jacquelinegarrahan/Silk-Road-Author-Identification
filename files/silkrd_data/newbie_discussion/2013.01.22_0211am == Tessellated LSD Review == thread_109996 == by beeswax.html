				I&#039;ll start by saying that my package arrived in exactly on week of placing the order.&nbsp; The stealth was above and beyond.&nbsp; Communication was perfect as well.&nbsp; The day after I received the order I left town for a week long trip.&nbsp; The day after I got back I decided to take one tab and my girlfriend also took one tab.&nbsp; We went to a park with some blankets and layed out in the sun on the grass as we began to come up.&nbsp; The come up was strong but gentle and smooth.&nbsp; The smells of the outdoors were beautiful and the cool breeze felt excellent in the hot sun.&nbsp; i closed my eyes and had intricate CEV&#039;s with bright colors.&nbsp; Yellows, purples, greens.&nbsp; Many faces morphing in on themsleves and what seemed to be a woman swirling around in the holographic makeup of the universe.&nbsp; Nothing but good vibes and love.&nbsp; All positive energy the entire trip.&nbsp; My girlfriend and I came back to my place and layed on my bed for quite some time just laughing and rubbing a very soft blanket on our selves.&nbsp; We both felt like we couldnt tell where our bodies ended and everything else began.&nbsp; We felt light and euphoric.&nbsp; the visuals were strong and always present.&nbsp; I could feel the molecule massaging my brain in a very pleasant manner.&nbsp; Great body high throughout.&nbsp; We then went for a walk with our headphones in and I could see geometric shapes and patterns on every surface.&nbsp; While listening to pretty lights radio and phutureprimitive radio on pandora I seemed to be swept away to other worlds.&nbsp; The trip lasted a good 9+ hours.&nbsp; Some visuals remained for a little while after that even with some weed until I fell asleep.&nbsp; I could certainly tell that this was quality LSD and I believe the dosage to be accurate.&nbsp; One tab was a powerful experience.&nbsp; As long as Tessellated sells LSD I dont think I&#039;ll be going to any other vendor.&nbsp; If I was made of money I would purchase a large amount so that I could have it for quite some time.&nbsp; I will be purchasing more soon.&nbsp; Thanks Tessellated and keep up what you&#039;re doin.&nbsp; Please dont stop spreadin that amazing shit around.&nbsp; Best LSD I&#039;ve had hands down.

				lol i also dosed on tesselated tabs on sunday and i must say. the 200ug is very accurate.&nbsp; he is an excellent vendor in my opinion and his lsd is spot on. on a side note i was quite upset when i couldnt post and didnt know what was going on .&nbsp; i kept messaging people in the avengers lsd thread asking what the heck is going on. i posted to the admin and was like a pm explaining things to newb&#039;s or a heads up message to read a certain post would have saved me the hours of reinstalling software and looking through the forum help desk was pretty much useless no offense.

				I think I&#039;m going to use mine for a microdosing experiment. I&#039;ll start as low as 25mcg, and go no higher than 50. I&#039;m just curious what effect this will have on &quot;normal&quot; days.<br /><br />Albert Hofmann himself did a microdosing regimen, and speculated that small doses of LSD might be used in place of ritalin.<br /><br />I know it would be more fun to just pop a tab and let fly, but that&#039;s not what I&#039;m going for right now.<br /><br />Anyone have personal experience with a microdosing regimen?

				Starry Eyed, I&#039;d be very curious to learn how the microdosing experiment goes.&nbsp; I thought of doing this with psilocybin a while back but never followed through.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please update us on the project :).&nbsp; Also, I just noticed that Lucydrop has lower dosage tabs listed at very reasonable prices.&nbsp; Anyone had any experience with their acid and can comment on quality and strength?&nbsp; I am certainly going to continue purchasing from tessellated as his shit is the bomb, but it may be cool to purchase a bulk order of Lucydrops tabs if they are of good quality as well just because of the price.

				Ended up sweeping up the last ten strip from the print Tessellated had before this current one, so at the time i lucked out, but it only took another week for tess to get the L that&#039;s up there now... which is fucking deece.&nbsp; Super fast shipping, great communication, and very stealthy. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Now i just gotta wait for a good day to drop.

I wasn&#039;t sure this would even produce a noticeable change in perception, but it did. Not too long after ingesting (~40 minutes), I began to experience a sort of shift in my thoughts. I felt much more relaxed than usual, but also very much in control of things. My vision became clearer, and I didn&#039;t have to strain my eyes to see anything (I have experienced this phenomenon on other psychedelics, especially psilocybe mushrooms). I went for a walk, and physical sensations were pronounced. I was much more aware of the movements of my body. Colors seemed to fill the air between me and the objects I looked at. I smoked a little bit of cannabis sativa, and this was pure pleasure. This strain (Amnesia Skunk) can set my mind spinning in loops sometimes, but today, it made everything even more right.<br /><br />I took another 20mcg at about the 3-hour mark, then went to the grocery store. I normally feel kind of bogged down by this sort of activity, but it was a fun experience today. I bought way more stuff than I would have--not because I was feeling frivolous, but because my mind was open to new possibilities, whereas I&#039;m usually trying to get out of the store. I enjoyed the colors and people and the very sensation of taking it all in. I engaged people on a more relaxed plane. A lot of times, I think conversation with me can be like pulling teeth for both parties. Today, it flowed naturally, and I enjoyed being a part of it.<br /><br />Everything was easier, calmer, and more fun to do today. Life felt less burdensome, and more promising. 20mcg acted as a nice combination anti-depressant, sedative, and stimulant. The additional 20mcg boosted these feelings to a level of greater vibrancy, though for the sake of experimentation, I wish I&#039;d stuck with the initial dose. The positive effects have lasted me all day. I haven&#039;t decided whether or not to dose tomorrow, and if so, how much.
