				Short:<br /><br />I ordered 3 items at the same time, Elvis was the first to mark his in transit and it arrived 2 days later. Very prompt, good amount, great quality. The stealth could have been better. It was one of the most overwhelming experiences of my life, second only to a very humbling shroom trip I had a few years ago. It&#039;s a truly awe inspiring substance and I understand why so many people have a spiritual re-awakening. It can also be the most horrific 10 minutes of your life if you aren&#039;t careful. This isn&#039;t a party drug, it isn&#039;t something you take because your bored or you want to have a good time. It&#039;s a substance designed to destroy your reality, respect it.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I had just finished an amazing night trying Underground&#039;s excellent MDMA crystals. My gf&#039;s passed out and has no idea I ordered some&nbsp; personal psychedelic powder. I didn&#039;t want her to try it...there are just some people you know won&#039;t trip well. I check to make sure she&#039;s asleep, I pack a bowl with weed, sandwich a small amount of DMT smoke a lungful and lay back.<br /><br />A minute later I have that familiar anxious sensation that tells me my perceptions about to be warped. Objects in the distance start to move and wave, pictures are slowly starting to blink down at me as the room begins to breath. &quot;Oh wow&quot;, I think to myself astonished by the sudden rush I was experiencing. Once DMT begins it comes at you fast and hard. Small lights in the room intensify taking on different colors and odd shapes. Shadows move, dance and taunt each other while the silence DEAFENS ME. I&#039;m suddenly aware at how quiet the room is and I start to get uncomfortable but at this point I&#039;m already starting to come down.<br /><br />Ok...not bad... I can handle that. Some music would be nice. Lets add some more on top, cover it and go for a full blow trip. I come across a song dedicated to DMT trips. A very light whimsical song that seems perfect for this kind of drug. I pause the video in full screen mode so all I have to do is smoke and press play.<br /><br />First hit...yummy tasty weed. Second hit... nasty harsh dmt (&quot;Hold it in as long as you can!&quot;). Third hit ....getting that anxious feeling again, smoke feels harsher than ever have to close eyes to keep from coughing. Fourth hit.... entire room is moving, bowl looks out of place in my hand. Fifth hit...the bowl looks very unfamiliar but I still manage to inhale a lungful and press play. The smoke flows past me like thick cream, everything has a very odd glean about it like it&#039;s encased in shiny plastic. The room was gone before my head hit the pillow. <br /><br />There&#039;s no way to describe with certainty what happened next. The room had melted into a black void and from where the ceiling should be manifested these shapeless mass of colors. Orange, yellow, gold, blue, green, white red was filling the room, I was forced to close my eyes because of it&#039;s intensity but they did not go away. They began forming intricate shapes. Patterns within patterns within patterns formed spiraling towards a center with these bright vibrant colors. It moved, swayed, morphed to my emotions and responded to the music. Every color had its own meaning but I was too overwhelmed to understand any. All I remember was red meant pain and it stayed in the periphery of the shapes. <br /><br />&quot;This is infinity, this is infinity, this is infinity&quot;, I begin chanting to myself staring into the center feeling my body merging with the endless spiral...it was as if my entire being expanded and became part of everything. Then I felt the presence of someone else.<br /><br />Without a doubt this is where many say they saw god/aliens/etc. I had become part of the spiral and I stood staring at myself as the infinite patterns spewed from my mouth. I was opening and closing my mouth as hard as I could performing for the being that had sovereignty over the spiral. It was now my job and I would stay there creating the universe for this being, forced to be his puppet. There was no reason for it, no hostility, no promise of peace or any sort of deal...just complete and utter submission. <br /><br />I don&#039;t remember much more after that.&nbsp; When I started coming down I was once again uneasy with how silent the room was. The music had finished and I lay there in bed, my jaw sore and very confused. I didn&#039;t remember what happened, I just knew it was extremely intense and that I got completely lost in the trip. I didn&#039;t even remember the song I was listening to it was like I woke up from a dream (which, I figure, is basically exactly what happened).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The next day I decided I&#039;d give it another try. I&#039;m looking online for music and I come across the song from last night. As soon as I listen to it I get the CRAZIEST feeling of deja vu ever (almost tripped me out more than the drug itself). The trip comes flashing back to me in great detail and for a moment I almost feel like I&#039;m high again. Now I can&#039;t listen to the song without thinking of the spiral and laughing<br /><br />It was a powerful, positive experience for me. If anyone reading this wants to try DMT for the first time, be careful. You&#039;ll underestimate how powerful this drug is, but don&#039;t fight it because it could be one the most horrific trips of your life. Elvis will hook you up with some good quality stuff.

				I&#039;ve done DMT on three occasions before ordering Elvis&#039;s DMT.<br /><br />It came on time (and, as OP stated, stealth wasn&#039;t great but whatever it got here early). I ordered 200mg, which is 5 doses for me (don&#039;t know how much you guys use but I&#039;m used to 40 mg).<br /><br />I don&#039;t wanna go into too many details about my trip, but just know that is is the craziest psychedelic experience ever. I&#039;ve done shrooms and acid and they are NOTHING compared to DMT.<br /><br />It was the best DMT I&#039;ve ever had*. Hands down.<br /><br />I highly recommend Elvis. It&#039;s very reasonably priced too.<br /><br />*Keep in mind that I&#039;ve only had it three times before, though. I&#039;m not by any means a connoisseur.

				i vaporized DMT after i was already tripping on 2 hits each mescaline and LSD. Don&#039;t EVER, ever do that unless your ready to truly experience was death is. I was convinced I was dead when it happened, it was such a mindfuck. I had tripped hard on DMT before, but this was next level, It felt as though I passed through the veil of even remotely being connected to my 3d consciousness. I was inside this infinitely complex cosmic puzzle, that just multiplied in geometric complexity, color,and brightness... I was the puzzle, I saw it from every angle. I&#039;m not going to get into it too much more, but I tripped full on, out of body for over an hour and half, because this 1 1/2hr mix was playing the whole time and I tripped completely the whole time. I&#039;VE NEVER BEEN THE SAME AND NEVER WILL BE. but it was the most beautiful psychedelic experience I&#039;ve had to date. I wouldn&#039;t necessarily recommend that combo to anyone but the devoted psychonaut with lots of inner peace.

				Hello everymind here i present you a fabolous..<br /><br />ELVIS DMT FULL REPORT<br /><br />BUYING EXPERIENCE:<br />200mg arrived fast to south EU with SR average stealth.<br /><br />MY PREVIOUS PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES:<br />LSD: about 20x<br />salvia: once<br />2cb: about 50x<br />dob: 2x<br />ipomoea purpurea seeds (lsa): about 10x<br />potent weed: uncountable times<br />had also an OOBE with inhaled Trichloroethylene (i don&#039;t suggest&nbsp; it to whom likes this life)<br />never tried DMT before --&gt; first experience<br />---<br />WAY OF ASSUMPTION:<br />i chose this way of assumption: http://goo.gl/Tvzzx (link to youtube) supposing it had to be the best way to smoke everything with the less amount of substance wasted.<br />---<br />20mg EXPERIENCE:<br /><br />Set:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- eager to try it out and a bit apprehensive &#039;cause i knew it is safer to have a sitter with this stuff.<br />Setting:&nbsp; -alone in my little flat, warm temperature, comfortable clothes, dim yellow light, complete silence.<br /><br />First try fail: i knew it evaporates at about 70c° so i was too careful with the flame. let it evaporate well, the vapour has to be milky, stinky and harsh. no liquid form should remain (with twice the substance i could not see if there was still some liquid on the bottom of the 1,5l bottle--&gt; too much vapour).<br /><br />Timing:<br />onset: 1&#039;<br />plateau: 2-3&#039;<br />uncospicuous in: 6&#039;<br />back to baseline: 12&#039;<br /><br />effects: heartbeat rate rush, vibration going up my spine on an ass to brain highway, body heaviness and detachment*, pulverization of sight in thousands of colored fragments. notice that when plateau is reached HB rate stabilizes.<br />On Sasha scale: ++ <br /><br />45mg EXPERIENCE:<br /><br />Set:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- eager to try it out and a bit apprehensive &#039;cause i knew it is safer to have a sitter with this stuff.<br />Setting:&nbsp; -my little flat with a trusted psychonaut friend, warm temperature, comfortable clothes, dim yellow light, did 5 minutes meditation to find inner peace and open my mind (yes i&#039;m fast doin&#039; it ;)<br /><br />Timing:<br />onset: 1&#039;<br />plateau: 2-3&#039;<br />uncospicuous in: 12&#039;<br />back to baseline: 24&#039;&#039;<br /><br />effects: heartbeat rate rush, vibration going up my spine on an ass to brain highway, body heaviness and detachment*,&nbsp; acquired ability to see a new non-describable dimension, when invisible things revealed to me while i detached from my body i first noticed a clown face on my ceiling, at first first i was a bit scared but then i realized his full nature and understood he was not a menace but just a grimace--&gt; a distorsion of the energy flow of the 4th dimension, a flow that permeates everything everywhere. then when i inspired i suddenly became the air entering my lungs and i enjoyed very much all the spirals and movement i did as an airstream, my trippin&#039; conscience had not clear bounds or measure. then i used this expanded consciousness to search grips and energy knots within my lower bodies (phisical and ethereal) and i found it very easy to adjust them).<br />On Sasha scale: +++ <br /><br />OVERALL EXPERIENCE:<br />This substance gave me the most intense psychedelic experience i&#039;ve ever had and i enjoyed it immensely. <br />btw my life has not changed at all after this experience. i now consider this the more suited substance to the true psychonaut.<br /><br />enjoy this stuff if you can trip. =) <br />good bye
