				Hi everyone, <br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR and last week I pulled the trigger on some NBOME. Since it&#039;s so cheap I got 100x from one vendor and 25x from another. The thing is, I&#039;m getting a little paranoid since I started searching for NBOME in my country and there are only references to LSD in the police news, which put it at high price so 100x tabs would be like 5000 thousand, which is imputable for traffic. <br /><br />I know that if I get anything unusual like having to sign the card (I&#039;m in an apt. building with reception and I&#039;ve never had to sign for anything) I just have to deny deny deny, but even so, I doubt that the monkeys from the police around here are able to differentiate between LSD and NBOME. Also, there&#039;s always pictures in the news for shippings that look &quot;stealthy&quot; but It seems that making them &quot;stealthy&quot; gets them flagged easily. Any advice (apart from not buying that much if it&#039;s for personal use)? Also, these are some news articles with the &quot;stealthy&quot; methods used to ship to my country. If anything, that should also serve as advice to sellers.<br /><br />http://www.vivimoslanoticia.cl/policial/fotos-interceptan-sospechoso-paquete-que-contenia-lsd/<br />http://www.lacuarta.com/noticias/cronica/2013/03/63-151548-9-decomisan-mas-de-550-dosis-de-lsd-para-hacerse-tira.shtml<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I mean, this busted shipments (from the links) were supposed to be stealthy by SR standards? Also since police around here is dumb and the law isn&#039;t clear, they could charge me from having LSD just because it&#039;s on tabs.<br /><br />BTW I&#039;m in Chile<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for the reply anyways.

				If you were in fact to get arrested your lawyer could easily demand that the drugs in question be lab tested to verify what the drug is.&nbsp; Chances are the police would have it tested regardless, since otherwise you could simply claim it was nothing more than paper with a design on it.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t stress out about it too much, tab sheets are about the easiest thing to get through customs.&nbsp; So unless they do a controlled delivery or catch you with them in your possession, you shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about.

				I think I won&#039;t worry too much, and if they have me sign up I&#039;ll just won&#039;t receive. I&#039;ll also ask for tips to a lawyer relative (and close friend) just in case.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies!

				Dude, don&#039;t worry about it. Anything that comes as a blotter is unlikely to be detected, but it&#039;s good to see paranoid people in the newbie board, I was beginning to think that I was the only noob on the SR who understood the importance of some healthy paranoia.

				I wouldn&#039;t stress too much. They will Definitely test it if it&#039;s intercepted and although I&#039;m sure 25i is scheduled it&#039;s probably not in the same schedule as LSD.. which sucks because you can actually OD on nBOMe pretty easily whereas you can take a 10 strip of actual LSD and just be in for a wild time. That being said, don&#039;t be that asshole who goes to a show with $100 worth of nbome and walks out with $2g. DON&#039;T sell it as LSD because people are going to take too much. I&#039;ve seen too many ambulance carts at festivals dragging people away who took too much of what they thought was something else. FUCK RC&#039;s&nbsp; FUCK SCAMMERS, If you wanna sell that shit as it is to people who want to buy 25i sell it as 25i. &lt;/rant&gt;

				LOL, Stop freaking out!!!<br /><br />I&#039;m still a &#039;newbie&#039; but have made about $6,000.00 worth of purchases over the last 4.5 months (MDMA, Cocaine, Ketimine &amp; Oxycodone/Oxycontin). I just haven&#039;t felt the need to spam to 50 so I can post in the regular forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would caution you about speaking to ANYBODY about using Silk Road&#039;s services, period.&nbsp; Its kind of the same principle of growing pot; Do not tell another living soul unless you absolutely have to.&nbsp; Once its done and you have the shit in your hand I would immediately write with a sharpie on the front &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&#039; in big letter&#039;s and do not open the package until you&#039;re in a safe place.&nbsp; When you do tell people where the product comes from (which is a good idea from a sales point of view) I would put yourself a few degree&#039;s of separation from Silk Road.&nbsp; I primarily sell MDMA as its one of the few drugs on SR that&nbsp; I can make a good profit off of.&nbsp; Point being what I say to my friends and customers is, &quot;This shit came from Silk Road so I can promise a money back guarantee as far as quality is concerned, *This girl I know has been ordering this shit off Silk Road for a little while now now and everything she gives me is fire*&quot;<br /><br />This throws people off the scent and doesn&#039;t let them know I&#039;m the one 100% behind everything LOL.&nbsp; I like the idea of changing the supplier&#039;s sex as it really unknowingly confuses people.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lets face it people talk and gossip so when the XTC hits and people are rolling their asses off feeling like can trust whomever they are with, what they tell those around them doesn&#039;t, in theory, lead anybody to me. I will even take a call requesting product and tell the person I have to call my guy and go pick it up when in reality I&#039;m sitting on it so I just say that, wait about 20-30 minutes and then tell them that my buddy dropped it off etc... That way people don&#039;t think you&#039;re sitting on a large mound drugs etc... Some people don&#039;t even know I&quot;m a &quot;dealer&quot;... they just think that if they&nbsp; get with me ahead of time I can &quot;hunt down some shit&quot; for them when in actuality Its in my bedroom all along :)<br /><br />You&#039;ve ordered paper so as others have stated, that is the easiest thing to get through customs. You just have the first time buyer jitters but it will pass when you receive your package in the mail.&nbsp; Dont&#039; forget to write return to sender on it and also do not open / sell product from same address.<br /><br />The only things that could go wrong is you putting in the wrong address or having somebody steal your package.<br /><br />My advice to you is: Go blaze a joint, or whatever you do to relax.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine man, just keep your mouth shut about where you&#039;re getting this stuff from IMO.&nbsp; I&#039;d tell them its coming from Silk Road, just that its a girl down the way that gets it, or your friend&#039;s uncle or some crazy shit like that<br /><br />Hope this helps!!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE SILK ROAD!!!

				don&#039;t worry brother.. if you haven&#039;t ordered like a large amount (commercial quantity) you should be fine even if its caught by customs.. they will prob burn it or wouldn&#039;t bother following it up.

				Rest assured my friend, I received some MDMA to the US without any concern.&nbsp; Plus if an issue should arise I&#039;m sure your vendor will work with you to make it right.

It&#039;s very probable that scammers are selling nbome or other shit as LSD and nobody knows the difference. Also, I&#039;m not selling, just wanted to get something fun from SR and got to know about 25i/25c and I couldn&#039;t believe how cheap it was, so I got 100 tabs which is &quot;commercial quantity&quot; even if it&#039;s for personal use.<br /><br />

				Sending blotter through the mail is probably the safest way to transport a drug. Just don&#039;t sign for anything and deny deny deny if you do get caught up. I tried to do some research on its legal status in your country but couldn&#039;t find anything. It may not be scheduled specifically there so you have that going for you too.

				HA HA! I laugh nervously.&nbsp; Made my first purchase last week for Monday delivery.&nbsp; Human nature being what it is, I left for an errand Monday morning and HAD to drive by the post office.&nbsp; There in the lot was an unmistakable unmarked LEO.&nbsp; So I pull in and take a look.&nbsp; I casually sit in my car a few spaces away, and he COMES OUT from the PO IN A SUIT!&nbsp; Then, he sits in his car and doesn&#039;t leave right away.&nbsp; Instead, he&#039;s leafing through his 8X5 paper note-pad.&nbsp; Probably checking my address, no doubt!<br /><br />I leave, and he FOLLOWS ME!.&nbsp; By now, I&#039;m ready to pull over and confess!&nbsp; NO!, my inner anarchist says: &quot;you can do this!&quot;&nbsp; And, I drive back home, circling the block for unmarked or government tags cars.&nbsp; Back home, I sit on the computer all morning with one eye on the street.&nbsp; Finally, the mailman comes up the lawn and SHIT, HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR!!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I answer, and he asks me to SIGN A REGISTERED LETTER!&nbsp; I do, and it&#039;s some unrelated bullshit.<br /><br />But there in the mailbox, lies the prize.&nbsp; Cleverly disguised as (I&#039;ll leave it at that).&nbsp; After a few hours, I stopped glancing out the window, and sampled the product.&nbsp; God bless SR.&nbsp; And remember, human nature never changes.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to you to do due diligence, then ignore that inner siren.&nbsp; <br /><br />That night, I slept like a baby.

				+1 to everyone who told the OP to chill<br /><br /><br />The reason&nbsp; &nbsp;25n nBOME&#039;s are SO cheap is that they ARE &quot;easy and cheap to make&quot;&nbsp; ......&nbsp; Certainly &#039;compared to LSD&#039;<br /><br /><br />As everyone has said OP . . . you&#039;ll be fine!<br />

				No need to freak out, but always be careful. Thats a good policy...<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t think signing for a package compromises anything.&nbsp; It still doesn&#039;t prove you were expecting anything.&nbsp; I think NOT signing, although not proof either, raises suspicion.<br /><br />One man&#039;s opinion
