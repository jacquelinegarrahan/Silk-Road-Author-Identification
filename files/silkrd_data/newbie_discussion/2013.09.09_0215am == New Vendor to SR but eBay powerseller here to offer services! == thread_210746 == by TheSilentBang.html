				We are a wholesaler of the quality protection packaging. A client we were selling to on eBay had told us about SR so now we are here to see if we can bring our seller skills to the market! We were only going to be selling packaging but we see we have good product compared to a lot of sellers here so it may be possible we get some good business and reviews soon! We just had one buy of a pack of mbb bags and a few inquiries already we barely just started adding listings! Anything we can assist you with will be more than happy to help!<br /><br />As far as packaging depending on your location we will determine the necessary procedures to ensure a safe delivery. Yes vac,mbb possible decoy depending on location. We may be a new vendor on here but we have used craigslist and ebay and many other markets and have great success with delivery rate as not one package seized or held. Also we will offer a guarantee delivery and a free reship in the event of seizure which has never happened and we do use tracking on all packages but for both our safety it is not released unless a customer claims non arrival. <br /><br />We are not here to step on any toes we understand there are many veterans on here that have been providing a good service and all we ask for is a chance to offer our products to the SR community! Maybe we have something to offer that another vendor does not, if that may be the case then please feel free to check out vendor page and any questions don&#039;t hesitate to contact us and we shall reply within 24 hours of receiving your message!<br /><br />Thank you for the opportunity to be on such an extraordinary market like this and I believe we can provide a great service and great products to you very quickly so please don&#039;t hesitate to contact us! Thank you all!<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />-_TheSilentBang_-<br /><br />Vendor Page: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6f2dd9119f
