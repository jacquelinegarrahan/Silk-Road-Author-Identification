				Can anyone, experience with USPS give me some insight on what&#039;s going on with my tracking. I can confirm the address on the package is correct as was told by USPS. Would they attempt to get it to me, or is lost? It&#039;s going on 10 days as of tomorrow, and the package was sent priority.<br /><br />Thanks!!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 10, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Expected Delivery By:<br />July 5, 2013<br /><br />USPS Tracking / Delivery Confirmationâ„¢<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Missent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 10, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 9, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Undeliverable as Addressed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 5, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />[LOCATION REMOVED] <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Arrival at Post Office<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 5, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Depart USPS Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 5, 2013<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 4, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Depart USPS Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 3, 2013<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Processed at USPS Origin Sort Facility<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 3, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Acceptance (APC)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />July 3, 2013, [TIME REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />[LOCATION REMOVED]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

				Um, dude do you really want to post that much tracking detail? I mean that info could easily be used by LE to identify that package.

				Undeliverable as addressed - did you per chance use a fake name, fake address, misspelled name/address, name of a previous resident, etc?

				Sorry guys it wasn&#039;t anything illegal so I wasn&#039;t worried just trying to get an answer. And no fake name, address, or anything. I assume there was a sub letter carrier that goofed up because it arrived the day after the 4th. There wasn&#039;t even a delivery attempt so how can it be possible or stated it was undeliverable if it made it to my post office fine. If this topic is an issue please remove and I will revise.<br /><br />Thanks

				Oh sorry about that, it&#039;s easy to forget there are &#039;legal&#039; things on the road too haha. Hm the tracking does look kind of odd.<br /><br />As a side note, I&#039;m going to guess that package could still get identified solely on the date/time of the tracking details listed (as in the only package with that particular combination of date/times in tracking detail).

				Yes sir I found out and confirmed the address was my physical address on the package. As I contacted a post office at the same zip code the sorting facility is and she was able to pull up an image of the label. However where it was missent was my hopes they uncovered the error and were going to reroute it back to me otherwise it should have just gone back to the return address. I guess where I&#039;m getting anxious is where it&#039;s stuck on the processed through sorting facility scan. I&#039;ve accepted it&#039;s either going to randomly show up or it&#039;s been abducted by aliens....

				&nbsp;Just dealt with this situation this morning and have some information to add to the discussion that I feel will definitely help ease some people&#039;s minds. I went to check my DCN tracking and it had stated that it was missent.&nbsp; :o Naturally I instantly got quite worried and began investigating around. Thankfully SR Forums are incredibly informational and a lot of the posts that I read on this subject helped a lot!! Thanks to all of u that took time to share very helpful information on these threads! <br />&nbsp;When reading a post that stated that it may be a fake name issue and/or address mix up I couldn&#039;t contain my suspicion any longer and called the post office that it last showed up at. I very nervously gave the lady my alias, address, along with my throw away phone # and DCN and waited in suspense. She called back and told me that what happened was the machine sorting the mail scanned the return address, which was in the city of the post office I was talking to, instead of my address. They had already realized the issue and had put it back to be placed in the correct spot. I was told it is now going to be sent off later today to the correct place and I should get it within 1-2 days. WHEW!!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; They were very helpful and nothing seemed sketchy at all, which is always a big relief in our line of business!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />PEACE&amp;LOVE to all my fellow pioneers here on the road! Keep up the outstanding quality of service we have going on here, can&#039;t find it anywhere else. <br />&lt;&lt;&lt;W.L.K&gt;&gt;&gt;
