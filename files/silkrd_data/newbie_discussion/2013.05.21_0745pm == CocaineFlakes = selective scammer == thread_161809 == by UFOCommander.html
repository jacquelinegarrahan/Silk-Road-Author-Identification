				Hello,<br /><br />i was recently scammed by CocaineFlakes for a 2gr coke order<br />the stuff he sent wasnt cocaine at all, it was just some cutting agent i suppose since it had only the look of coke but no effect nor any smell of cocaine<br />i even double washed the product to see if i can at least get something out of it with no results, the stuff reacted like random coke when washed with some loss of course but there was a weird taste and 0 effect when smoking it.<br />it looked very shiny (way more then usual coke or even good fishscale) and was stone hard to crush to powder, actually i never had any coke that hard <br />i saw that stuff allready as a left over when washing some localy scored coke and it was the leftovers in the spoon after the wash thats why i assume it is a cutting agent.<br />vendor didnt wanted to give me a refund and even said that i was the scammer since my package arrived.<br />if you search for his name in the forums you will see that im not the only one complainig about his quality !<br /><br />so my advice would be to stay away from this vendor since there are lots more good coke vendors on here<br /><br />EDIT:<br />couldnt find the pineaplelove labtest topic but here is another exemple &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=117967.msg1030629#msg1030629<br /><br />look the post from koelen3, being sick and have your nose bleeding like hell doesnt sound like good coke to me !<br /><br />also look on his vendor page , some one else gave a 2/5 feedback because of&nbsp; his quality
