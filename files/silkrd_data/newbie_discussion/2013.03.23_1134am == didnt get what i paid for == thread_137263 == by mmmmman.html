				Ummm<br /><br />This may sound rude but it sounds like you really haven&#039;t done anything except eyeball it to concludde its not what you ordered... Sorry to say but on the statement you have made it sounds like you have little to no experience with the many different ways that crystal (?? meth maybe? many things can be crystal so the word doesn&#039;t give any real idea what you had ordered) can come...<br /><br />I would be very polite with the vendor and do a little more work to be able to say 100% its not gear... I think you are going to find you just &#039;seen&#039; a different way that meth can look and hopefully learned the lesson that talking shit about shit you have no idea about can end with you feeling a little silly... <br /><br /><br />you made a Big call though and not much to back your assumptions up in the OP so don&#039;t be surprised if the room gets a little warmer than even I have left it.<br /><br />Good luck....
