				I dont know which combo to choose<br />lets start from the beginning:<br /><br />+0h acid (150ug)<br />+4h mdma (100mg)&nbsp; &nbsp; - typical candyflipping with 2cb at the and to smooth molly comedown and prolong the high<br />+3h 2cb (15mg)<br /><br />or<br />+0h mdma (130mg)<br />+3h 2cb (15mg)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - typical nexusflipping with 100ug acid to bring it deeper<br />+2h acid (100ug)<br /><br />or<br />+0h mdma (130mg)<br />+2,5h acid (100ug)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- emphasis is mdma which will be felt deeper and trippier because of lsd and 2cb<br />+4h 2cb (15mg)<br /><br />or<br />+0h 2cb (15mg)<br />+2h mdma (100mg)&nbsp; &nbsp; - great combo (2cb+mdma) again supported by lsd to bring it deeper<br />+2h acid (100ug)<br /><br />or<br />+0h 2cb (15mg)<br />+2h acid (100ug)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- typical combo (lsd+2cb) supported by mdma at the end to make the whole trip smoother and happier<br />+4h mdma (80mg)<br /><br />I would be glad to hear your opinion about it and whether you had had this kind of 3 psycho drugs combo or not yet<br /><br />P.S. Maybe some of you think, I should throw one drug completely away out of this list of choices<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />

				My vote with some mods&gt;<br /><br />+0h acid (150ug)<br />+4h mdma (140mg)&nbsp; &nbsp; - typical candyflipping with 2cb at the and to smooth molly comedown and prolong the high<br />+3h 2cb (10mg)<br /><br />I think 10mg of 2CB is enough and some more mdma 140mg can gives you a really kick at 4h!

				seems intense. I vote<br />&nbsp;+0h mdma (130mg)<br />+2,5h acid (100ug)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- emphasis is mdma which will be felt deeper and trippier because of lsd and 2cb<br />+4h 2cb (15mg)<br />

				Combos 1 and 3 seem most desirable to me.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to sound like your mum or anything, but cocktails like this can go from &quot;fantastic awesome shimmering bliss&quot; to &quot;oh shit this is getting HEAVY!&quot;<br /><br />The dosages sound reasonable though. There&#039;s no shame reducing them by a few mg in the spirit of harm reduction.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not actually tried 2cb - but I&#039;ve candyflipped a couple times and that was quite a ride!<br /><br /><br />Anyway, have a nice trip whatever you settle on.&nbsp; :)

				None of those combos should pose a medical risk - would mess you up pretty bad though
