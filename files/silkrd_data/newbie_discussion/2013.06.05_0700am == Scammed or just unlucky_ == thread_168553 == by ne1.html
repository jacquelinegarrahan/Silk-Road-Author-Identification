				The deal is this: I ordered 2 packages from a seller on SR. Both of them I finalized early because I thought that if you put in a resolution it somehow messes up your buyer&#039;s stats and whatnot. They were both seized and 2 custom&#039;s letters came to the two separate addresses that I ordered to. The second package was ordered after the first because I thought that it was going to definitely show up. <br /><br />The two letters are printed on different types of paper and feel different. Could be fake letters sent from the seller to make it look like the orders were seized. Another thing is, something like 2% of overall drug smuggling into this country gets seized, the rest is unnoticed. This causes for attention because 100% of my orders with this seller have been seized. <br /><br />My thoughts are this: this seller could well be working for the police department and is putting up extremely good deals so that he gets many addresses and names that he can pass along to the authorities. As far as I know, there is nothing stopping the police from doing exactly that.<br /><br />The seller is now ignoring me and there is no way for a refund as I finalized early (NEVER FINALIZE EARLY!!!)<br /><br />I have had to post this in the newbie section as it won&#039;t allow me to post anywhere else.<br /><br />Anyone else has the same experience?

				You can post in SR support if you think your claim has some validity to it, I recently received what appeared to be a seized package but after discussing it with another member they said the notice i received was extremely odd. More details on the seizure letters would help

				The first letter looks legit. The second letter is almost the same as the first, apart from it addresses me in a different way (ie. Dear Sir/Madam) and is printed on paper with a yellow tint to it, with some of the ink a bit faded in areas. Apart from those tiny differences the letters are the same. However, this is just part of my concern. My other concern is that after reading up on the seller and buying from it, I have reasons to believe that the addresses and names of everyone who has bought from this seller are being documented and kept written somewhere, hence my thinking that the info is passed to the cops. I understand that this allegation is very, very serious and therefore I probably shouldn&#039;t post the seller&#039;s name up since I can&#039;t prove any of this and I will never be able to prove it.

				Intriguing&nbsp; , maybe&nbsp; scan both docs ( blanking any address or names with paint or similar&nbsp; ) and upload them too an .onion image uploader and post the link for others ( especially any of your fellow countrymen who have received customs letters ) to give their opinion as to there authenticity ?<br /><br />If you don&#039;t scan but take pic&#039;s be sure to remove the meta data with meta data remover .
