				So I&#039;ve been reading up on what happens if your package is seized and what not and decided I&#039;d just start a thread where we can all post our experiences or knowledge on the subject. <br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering, particularly for Western Australia, what the process is for seized items. <br />I know that theres the love letter possibility for &quot;small&quot; orders, and possible controlled deliveries for &quot;large&quot; ones. <br /><br />Anyone know what might happen for shipments of single ounces of weed? How about a 1/4 pound? <br />It might sound silly calling an ounce &quot;large&quot; but here in WA being caught with any more than 10grams is an offence, under that and you can basically walk withut huge consequences. So would the same apply for shipments? I sure hope not. <br />I&#039;ve also heard what I can only call horror stories about LE letting 6 or 7 packages go through so they can build evidence against you and prosecute later. Any info on this?<br /><br />Would really like to know, particularly for WA, what constitutes a &quot;small&quot; order and a &quot;large&quot; order. Is an ounce large? How about a pound? Those decimals make all the difference. <br /><br />It&#039;s cool if you know nothing about Aus, share your experience anyway - knowledge is power :)

				I&#039;m from Melbourne, but I don&#039;t know much about the system here :S<br />But I have heard that our customs are tough, yet some people who&#039;ve ordered small quantities of drugs (and had the item opened) still got the drugs delivered to their house. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s bullshit or not.

				If its not then it could be he whole &quot;gathering evidence&quot; thing...<br /><br />How did he know it had been opened by customs? <br /><br />And yeah, the customs throughout australia are ridiculously tough

				I find it hard to believe that LE would examine a package and find contraband and let it continue on it&#039;s way to the customer. IMHO, if LE gets its hands on contraband, it&#039;s getting seized.
