				Lets play a game! Look at your purchasing stats and convert the amount of BTC spent into your local curreny at present rates... then subtract what you actually payed for that btc and how much money would you have saved if you never bought drugs and just saved the BTC?<br /><br />I spent about 70BTC but only payed maybe a total of $700 for it all over time. At ~$45/BTC now that would be $3150. I would have made $2450 profit if i never bought drugs and just waited till now to sell them.<br /><br />Now, you do the same and cry over it. :D<br /><br />Also this is my 50th post! Finally! I&#039;m freeeeee!!!

				I would say on average I probably paid about 9GBP a coin, as I have been here a while. I&#039;ve had in my possesion about 2500 coins in total. <br /><br />Sickening to think about..&nbsp; &gt;:(

				If I saved the BTC from my first purchase of BTC, I bought them at just below $5 so got &quot;100,something&quot;, alone from that first purchase I would, with the BTC at $46, have had accumulate $4600 today with an profit of $4100... which would NOT be all that great for my general health... at all! :P<br /><br />A friend of mine, 1 year+ on SR but not all BTC spent there, calculated that if he would have saved the BTC from every purchases so far has ever made he would have had around ~570 BTC!<br />He could not find enough info on what $-value the BTC bought over time so the real &quot;profit&quot; is unknown.<br />But he did say that his first BTC purchase was made when the BTC where at around $3, so just play with the thought (we did) if he had bought 570 BTC at $3, 570 x $3 = $1710, saved them, and today at $46/BTC, now at an value of $26220 - $1710 = total profit $24510!<br /><br />Well, coulda woulda shoulda, but then again, since I started my journey on the road, if I had not spent my money would not have been as fun, eye-opening and setting a standard on what the word &quot;quality&quot; really means.<br />The standard you get using SR, at least on my location, is so fucking high that all my fucking possibility&#039;s of ever again (wanting to anyway) buying any-fucking-drug, other than weed, outside of the road is fucked forever, both a blessing and a bit of a curse but a lovely curse I must say :D

				I bought my computer using BTC back when it was $0.72/BTC - I have never regretted any purchase more, given that the coins used to pay for it would now be worth somewhere in the region of $85,000.

				Wish these bitcoin prices were fixed. Makes me gutted and jealous to see it rising to a new high everyday.<br />Although i didn&#039;t spend a lot like you guys did, but at this peak price, i&#039;m afraid to stock up as i&#039;m worried it might fall!&nbsp; :-[
