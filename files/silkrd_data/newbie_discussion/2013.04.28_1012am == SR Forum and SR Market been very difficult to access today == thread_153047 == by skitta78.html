				Just want to know if eveyone else has had the same issues today.<br />Ive just managed to Log in after several times. Could not access the forum all day until the last hour and even now I have to retry 5 or more times to get a page to load. <br />Is this another DOS attack but on the forum this time? SR has been nearly as bad today also. \<br />Anyone know any reason why? After the recent DOS attack on SR it was running perfect until today. <br />Has DPR made any statement on the current problems?<br />This shit never stops. We need to upgrade the security I think..<br /><br />Now it will take 10 attempts to upload this post I bet.

				If you logon to SR, put your account to browse in incognito mode. Will help matters some with slowness.

				How resilient is the site to attacks? I would hate to think that any goon with a rented botnet could put it out of service.

				I&#039;m not all that familiar with Tor, but aren&#039;t DDOS attacks essentially impossible on dot onion addresses? My understanding is that for someone to be able to do this, they have to be attacking the server backend IPs associated with SR directly-- you shouldn&#039;t be able to use any sort of botnet or other DDOS style attacks to disable a dot onion address. I&#039;m no IT guru by any means but I did do my research on the Tor network before I started using SR and that was one of the features that encouraged me to use it.<br /><br />If I&#039;m wrong, I&#039;d love to be enlightened. My guess is that DPR is just referring to them as DDOS attacks because he doesn&#039;t want to give too much away and that&#039;s a term that most people who are even remotely tech savvy are familiar with. Many people are asking him for more information but to me this is counter-intuitive -- we want as little information about how these guys are attacking SR leaking-- it would only give would-be attackers more ammunition if he gave out detailed information.<br /><br />Just my .02-- would love some input on this from codemonkeys and sysadmins.
