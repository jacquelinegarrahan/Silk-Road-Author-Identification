				Hello all, I am in need of advice.<br />For my own personal reasons I am in need to flee from the police. My court date is coming up soon and I must be long gone.<br /><br />I need someone to point out a flaw in my plan. Anything will do, I just need to make sure I am tight on this whole plan.<br />I am going to flee to either New York City, Chicago, or las angelos. These cities being the three largest in the United States, I figure I can live undetected in these area&#039;s. I have a large sum of money which will last me the year which I will be gone (I plan on returning for another private reason).<br />Everything is cash and I will pay for everything with cash. I won&#039;t have a cell phone or contact anyone. I will pretty much stay to myself. The only person I will contact will not know where I am and I will only contact him via tormail. <br /><br />I will rent an apartment under fake documentation which I will buy. Ill have a credit card which I printed out corresponding to the same name as the fake Social security number card I bought from namedeclined and the ID I bought from teddanzig. When they ask for sorce of income I will quote my own personal business and I will most likely pay a few months rent up front. <br /><br />I will probably just stick to myself in my room doing drugs all day and playing video games. <br /><br />What am I missing or forgetting?<br />Sorry if the grammar/the whole thing is off, I&#039;m pretty fucked up right now.<br /><br />Thanks everyone

				Holy shit this is surreal. <br /><br />Can&#039;t give you advice, except consider if it&#039;s worth it if you get caught. <br /><br />I mean, once you do this, there&#039;s no going back right? Things will only get worse since you&#039;re now fleeing from the police. Don&#039;t you lose your whole identity. It&#039;s not like those charges will go away after a year right?

				1. Just because those cities are the largest doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re the easiest to be a ghost in. Yes they have huge population concentrations that make it improbable to be caught but they are also under the most powerful magnifying glass. There are surveillance systems being developed now that work through street and corner CCTV cameras and use facial recognition software to match ID points of the picture to online profiles. The system is still in the works so who knows when we&#039;ll truly be in the Orwellian vision of surveillance that knows everything at all times, but NYC will be one of the first places its implemented when it comes and LA and Chicago will follow suit. Those cities are practically their own mini police states. I would recommend moving either rural or suburban, but you could probably do well in a smaller city like Tampa. The key thing though is to not go anywhere that you&#039;ve been in the last few years, don&#039;t go anywhere that you have any contact with and don&#039;t go anywhere that you&#039;ve ever talked about going (either online or IRL). Do you really want to take the chance that someone will care enough or get lucky enough to pick up a thread and follow it to you?<br /><br />2. I&#039;d recommend taking more than enough if possible. Have some cash set aside specifically for an emergency. As for your other finances I&#039;m not sure how well fakes and false CC&#039;s can be done these days but if you feel the quality is high enough go for it. It&#039;s still risky though and you&#039;re still banking on not getting caught for financial fraud, something that iirc the fucking Secret Service looks into. You should look into prepaid services like Serve or the like that offer a prepaid card and opt for those that don&#039;t require an ID verification; Should be easier than passing a phony plastic. To back up your funny finances I&#039;d recommend doctoring up some phony utility bills under the matching name. It&#039;s not hard but do a good job at this and it could save your ass, because these days in my experience not many clerks think people will fake an itemized bill and ID card just to get a P.O. box under another name or whatever.<br /><br />3. Always, always always use burner phones for records that are kept by people other than yourself. <br /><br />4. Don&#039;t drive on a phony license, because if you get pulled the cops will run it through their system which is more intricate than just swiping the barcode for info. And you will be royally fucked on every charge they can think of, evading justice falsifying ID and financial documents and whatever you were on the hook for to begin with just to start.<br /><br />5. It will be tempting, hell it&#039;s tempting to everyone, but DON&#039;T talk about your old life in your new city. That you is gone, he&#039;s not coming back. It seems cynical but really you never know who you can trust and your new best meth buddy and friend in your new city may flip on you if they think it&#039;ll net them less attention or some reward cash. Even if they don&#039;t flip on you mistakes can be made and it&#039;s just not worth it. Don&#039;t keep up with ANY online profiles, not even SR that you have had before running, because it can easily be flagged and traced. <br /><br />If I can think of anything else I&#039;ll edit this and good luck, best wishes to ya!

				Stay out of NYC...Bloomberg has a police force the size of most national armies. How much time are you looking at? Prison is no fun, I was locked up before over some weed...not fun at all. The food is the absolute worst I found flies in my shit every day. The cells are cold, and the one blanket you get doesn&#039;t do any fucking thing.All you hear constantly is loud noises., it really start to bug you out after awhile. Not to mentioned I was attacked sexually by my cellie the first night.No I didn&#039;t get ass raped but I had to fight a guy off of me after waking up to him grabbing my dick.... Turns out the guy was a fucking pedophile who was insane!All over some fucking weed! America is turning into a police state leave the country and don&#039;t look back.South America has some countires which won&#039;t extradite...Just sayin&#039;

				I&#039;ve fled before, lasted about six months. Only flaw I see in your plan and thing I can recommend is never go back, as that is exactly how they caught me. <br /><br />On the flip side, my advice is you keep going to court, get your affairs in order and just do the time. All that money that will last you a year will last you a lifetime in prison, so whatever sentence you serve you&#039;ll be living lavish. Sitting inside of your apartment room all day, getting high and looking over your shoulder everywhere you go isn&#039;t any way to live. Prison is actually very similar to that, so why waste the time? Not to be pessimistic but you&#039;re bound to fuck up at some point, so no need to delay the inevitable.<br /><br />Like someone said before, you can only run so long before the past catches up with you. I say get it over with and move on with your life, keep your ties. All that fake documentation is for the birds, I just don&#039;t see how fake records are dependable in any way what with every apartment nowadays having a database that tracks how much water and electricity your room uses. Also, you say you&#039;ll reference your business but with no name tied to any real business and your tenant notices you never leave your room, eh, might draw suspicion. <br /><br />Then again, it all depends on your situation. If you&#039;re facing twenty five to life I might say haul it and make the most of it in the free. But if you&#039;re looking at even ten to twenty, non aggravated - hell, ride that shit out. <br /><br />Just my couple of pennies. Handle your business &amp; wish the best for you.

(No don&#039;t answer that). In most cases they&#039;re not going to send out a manhunt to find you if you miss a court date - at worst they might go knock at whatever address they have on record. More likely they&#039;ll just issue a warrant and wait until the next time you get pulled over. If it&#039;s just a year you might be better off just selling your car &amp; laying low in your city until the year is up.&nbsp; And before you go to all the trouble of creating a new identity, try to find out whether your warrant is extraditable or not. If it&#039;s not, there&#039;s no need to bother with&nbsp; hiding. Just move to another state. (Even if it is extraditable you&#039;d likely be okay - even interstate extraditions are expensive and many states won&#039;t want to spend the money). <br /><br />If you do need to go into hiding, don&#039;t bother renting an apartment. You&#039;ll be more invisible if you can find someone who wants a roommate instead. They&#039;ll happily take your cash &amp; you won&#039;t need to go to the trouble of setting up utilities etc &amp; you&#039;ll save money by not needing to furnish the place. Plus they&#039;ll be happy if you keep to yourself. <br /><br /><br />I want to know how it is that you know you&#039;ll be free in a year. If you can avoid a prison term just by hiding out until it&#039;s over that&#039;s news to me. ;)<br />

				What about the Mexico idea? I don&#039;t think you have to speak Spanish to go to Mexico? How about any of the border towns, people must speak English there. I guess main question would be if Mexico will extradite. Just guessing you could get into Mexico on your current &#039;real&#039; identification documents, and maybe get back into the U.S. with those as well after the threat has passed?

				Hiding in a big city is MORE EXPENSIVE because it is a BIG City even large sums of money may not be enough for you. Everything from room, to services and FOOD is much more expensive there think 5-10x what you pay in a small state.<br /><br />Cut off all ties to your social media accounts.<br />Never check your gmail/hotmail/yahoo again (they will all be subpoenaed and force to give up your info)<br />Do NOT use a smart phone in your name or a family name. No apps, no nothing. Android rooted if you have to under all new info.

				No need to forge a passport. There is also the old airport trick that you could do with a friend to fly internationally:<br /><br />1. Have a friend buy an international flight for himself<br />2. Forge an identical boarding pass with your name on it (easy, as you can print these out at home sometimes)<br />3. Enter the terminal with your real ID, fake boarding pass, and your friend with his real boarding pass.<br />4. Board the plane using your friend&#039;s ticket. In most US airports your ID is not scanned at the gate, nor when you enter security.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />(Also NYC seems like a bad place to go to, cops there stop you for anything)

				I wish you nothing but success on your turning invisible. Monty Python has a great skit about the guy trying not to be seen. As soon as he pokes his head out of hiding, he gets blown to kingdom come. Stay invisible. If you know you have to go into an area that is recording images, like a convenience or gas store, put something in one shoe to change your gait. Subtly change your speech by sticking a dental appliance in your mouth anytime you have to speak to anyone who might ever be called upon to remember you. <br /><br />Never spend a large amount of cash in one location, with one person. That makes them remember details you might want them to forget. If you feel the need for the human herd, attach yourself to a tour group at a museum, dressing in nondescript unremarkable clothing. Nothing too flashy or looking like it came out of a rubbish bin. If someone asks you &quot;what do you do&quot; one safe response is &quot;about what?&quot;. <br />

				&nbsp; If it&#039;s a prison sentence you are looking at....there IS no statute of limitations bud.&nbsp; You&#039;re lawyer &quot;friend&quot; must have went to a community college.&nbsp; The only way there is ever a statute of limitations is when you haven&#039;t been indicted by a grand jury.&nbsp; Since you have already been in court...you will have to be on the run FOREVER. <br /><br />&nbsp; See, the judge will place a felony warrant for failure to appear.&nbsp; Your sentence will be tossed out...especially if it&#039;s a plea, and you will gain new charges ie: bail jumping and a Contempt of Court.&nbsp; Then, to make an example out of you, they&#039;ll run all of the sentences consecutive and your original 1-3 becomes a 5-15.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, you will never ever receive any bail in any case ever again....<br /><br />That seems like alot of needless bullshit for a measly 1-3&nbsp; bro.&nbsp; I did six years and it was a cake walk...it ain&#039;t &quot;Oz&quot; fiction.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been in your predicament for 5+ years now and ya know what....it blows...hard.&nbsp; Slinking around, hoping you don&#039;t run into someone you used to know blows.&nbsp; Never seeing my family EVER again....not even a funeral....blows.&nbsp; Knowing that the Marshals will never stop (because they have no &quot;cold&quot; cases....they eventually get most people) blows.<br /><br />Like you, I thought it would be like the fucking Jason Bourne flicks but quickly realized how much work it actually is to be seriously on the run.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have this advice for you.&nbsp; Opt for an apartment in a poorer section of a mid-sized city like Salt Lake City, Sioux City IA, or Green Bay.&nbsp; These types of cities have 1/100th the police force as LA, NYC, Chicago, but are big enough to get lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;These cities also have high concentrations of Asian and Russian immigrants.&nbsp; Immigrants keep to themselves and could care less about the new tenant and what he does all day.&nbsp; Americans thrive on being nosy and snitching when it favors them....stay away from cities with low concentrations of immigrants of any kind.<br /><br />I would also advise that you change your tactic of playing video games and doing drugs all day...lol...you&#039;ve already been caught and just don&#039;t know it with crap like that.&nbsp; You should have a place which you can have a quick back way out. You should get familiar with the immediate surroundings and routes so you don&#039;t have to think on the fly while being persued by jack-boots who want nothing more than to rough you up or worse...it&#039;s no game to them and trust me bro...they take their jobs very very seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you find the right place, make it a place by yourself because roommates will get you caught very quick.&nbsp; If you&#039;re too recluse, they&#039;ll question.&nbsp; If you talk too much, you&#039;ll eventually get caught up in some lie and get caught.&nbsp; Perhaps a roommate will even rummage through your things while you are out.&nbsp; NO ROOMMATES!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; So you have a place...great...now up $50 and put a wireless camera at the front door. Then, buy a bar to put across the door on the inside...trust me, it will buy you the time you need to go out the back when the Marshals show up with that &quot;No Knock&quot; warrant.<br /><br />Get a part time job, it makes you seem normal.&nbsp; Fake ID&#039;s usually work for more mundane, low pay work.&nbsp; Nobody scans them, and noone does background checks as long as you have the right personality for a runner...confident and well read.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be confident when you talk about yourself and never offer any information that isn&#039;t asked because you&#039;ll trip yourself up.&nbsp; Always quit in February and move onto another ID set because once the person holding the SSN you&#039;re using with your fake set does their taxes....the jig is up.<br /><br />People wanna talk? Invent a story about a recent divorce and how you just needed a new start in *Any City*.&nbsp; This does two things for you.&nbsp; 1) Most people won&#039;t question someone too much about their past if they are aware of a recent divorce, merely out of respect.&nbsp; 2) It tells the person that they needn&#039;t worry that you don&#039;t have any friends because you are new in town...friends take time.&nbsp; &nbsp; This works.<br /><br />You should also have a stash of clothes, cash, alternate ID in an airport locker...not a bus locker.&nbsp; A bus locker is good for two weeks max before the janitors pilfer then with the master key.&nbsp; Airports offer long term storage and are large enough to get lost in a crowd if the heat is too close. Their locker keys are also tumbler locks with no master so they&#039;re as safe as a safe deposit box without all of the paperwork.<br /><br />You should always be persuing a flawless LEGAL ID as well.&nbsp; Fakes with enough credentials work for alot of things but every time you use them, it&#039;s stressful.&nbsp; A flawless ID set like you see in gangster flicks are available for purchase.&nbsp; They will pass governmental scrutiny, LE scrutiny....even loan officer scrutiny.&nbsp; If you know the right people, these can be bought for $15k ish.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to travel to NYC or LA, but is well worth the investment.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go alone and only pay with travelers cheques.&nbsp; If the seller won&#039;t accept them, you&#039;re being scammed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If this thread isn&#039;t some sort of hoax, I strongly advise you to re-evaluate your position.&nbsp; Do the time....it&#039;s nothing compared to what awaits you when you are caught.&nbsp; Your lawyer is an assclown and is giving you bad advice. Sorry to piss in your cornflakes but&nbsp; NO LAWYER would ever tell their client to run, so I question his motives.&nbsp; A lawyer is an Officer of the Court.&nbsp; That means that not only would he loose his license to practice law, he would face felony charges for aiding and abetting a felon.&nbsp; Sorry, but no lawyer would risk that for some wannabe runner with a one year sentence.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I have now been convinced that if the situation arises that I must leave the place I have fled to in the United States, that I will leave the country. Thanks for your idea I will start learning Spanish immediately. <br /><br />Now I just have the issue of how in the fuck do you get out of the United States with a warrant. The fake documentation means absolutely shit without a passport. I have looked everywhere to secure a legitimate passport, but it would seem I can&#039;t find any sellers. If anyone can help on that please do.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone for your help.

You should get familiar with the immediate surroundings and routes so you don&#039;t have to think on the fly while being persued by jack-boots who want nothing more than to rough you up or worse...it&#039;s no game to them and trust me bro...they take their jobs very very seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you find the right place, make it a place by yourself because roommates will get you caught very quick.&nbsp; If you&#039;re too recluse, they&#039;ll question.&nbsp; If you talk too much, you&#039;ll eventually get caught up in some lie and get caught.&nbsp; Perhaps a roommate will even rummage through your things while you are out.&nbsp; NO ROOMMATES!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; So you have a place...great...now up $50 and put a wireless camera at the front door. Then, buy a bar to put across the door on the inside...trust me, it will buy you the time you need to go out the back when the Marshals show up with that &quot;No Knock&quot; warrant.<br /><br />Get a part time job, it makes you seem normal.&nbsp; Fake ID&#039;s usually work for more mundane, low pay work.&nbsp; Nobody scans them, and noone does background checks as long as you have the right personality for a runner...confident and well read.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be confident when you talk about yourself and never offer any information that isn&#039;t asked because you&#039;ll trip yourself up.&nbsp; Always quit in February and move onto another ID set because once the person holding the SSN you&#039;re using with your fake set does their taxes....the jig is up.<br /><br />People wanna talk? Invent a story about a recent divorce and how you just needed a new start in *Any City*.&nbsp; This does two things for you.&nbsp; 1) Most people won&#039;t question someone too much about their past if they are aware of a recent divorce, merely out of respect.&nbsp; 2) It tells the person that they needn&#039;t worry that you don&#039;t have any friends because you are new in town...friends take time.&nbsp; &nbsp; This works.<br /><br />You should also have a stash of clothes, cash, alternate ID in an airport locker...not a bus locker.&nbsp; A bus locker is good for two weeks max before the janitors pilfer then with the master key.&nbsp; Airports offer long term storage and are large enough to get lost in a crowd if the heat is too close. Their locker keys are also tumbler locks with no master so they&#039;re as safe as a safe deposit box without all of the paperwork.<br /><br />You should always be persuing a flawless LEGAL ID as well.&nbsp; Fakes with enough credentials work for alot of things but every time you use them, it&#039;s stressful.&nbsp; A flawless ID set like you see in gangster flicks are available for purchase.&nbsp; They will pass governmental scrutiny, LE scrutiny....even loan officer scrutiny.&nbsp; If you know the right people, these can be bought for $15k ish.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to travel to NYC or LA, but is well worth the investment.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go alone and only pay with travelers cheques.&nbsp; If the seller won&#039;t accept them, you&#039;re being scammed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If this thread isn&#039;t some sort of hoax, I strongly advise you to re-evaluate your position.&nbsp; Do the time....it&#039;s nothing compared to what awaits you when you are caught.&nbsp; Your lawyer is an assclown and is giving you bad advice. Sorry to piss in your cornflakes but&nbsp; NO LAWYER would ever tell their client to run, so I question his motives.&nbsp; A lawyer is an Officer of the Court.&nbsp; That means that not only would he loose his license to practice law, he would face felony charges for aiding and abetting a felon.&nbsp; Sorry, but no lawyer would risk that for some wannabe runner with a one year sentence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^^^This.&nbsp; +1 Brother.<br /><br />@OP:&nbsp; You said that you have a warrant, warrants don&#039;t go away.&nbsp; You&#039;ve been charged, MadSeason is right, there is no&nbsp; statute of limitations for you now... nothing is going to go away in 1-3 years.<br /><br />http://www.lawqa.com/qa/will-my-warrant-ever-go-away<br /><br />Have a friend that just got locked up; he was just fishing, a fucking cop walked up and ran his fishing license.&nbsp; Guess he had a warrant from 95 that he didn&#039;t even know existed.&nbsp; And that&#039;s BS traffic court related shit!<br /><br />Maybe your attorney childhood &quot;friend&quot; was screwing your girlfriend/has a crush on her and just wanted you out of the picture.&nbsp; Maybe he just secretly always hated you.&nbsp; Sometimes you never know about somebody.... you can know them for a lifetime, then they turn on you for the stupidest thing.<br /><br />People run/flee for the stupidest shit.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a bigger city and many people here are transplants.&nbsp; I know 3 people that fled their home state... 2 of them for DUI, the other guy for hit and run.&nbsp; They just got scared and feared the worst, so they ditched out.&nbsp; Like these guys thought they were going to do time lol.<br /><br />I mean... if you&#039;re looking at life, then running is something to consider... but like I&#039;ve said before on these forums, it should be the last resort.&nbsp; The case should be taken as far as it can, then if you have to, bounce at the very last second.&nbsp; You never know how court will go.&nbsp; I had charges in the double digits... was looking at a very long time, like 60 years.&nbsp; Got most of the charges dropped, and time was knocked into single digits... of which I only did a portion due to me being an ideal inmate/first time offender.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to say it was a cake walk, but I survived.&nbsp; Oh I thought about running... but I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I can now try to move on with my life... don&#039;t get me wrong, being an ex-con sucks, but running would be worse.&nbsp; Imho, comparatively, doing the time was easy, it&#039;s once you get out that&#039;s difficult.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182109.msg1334699#msg1334699">Quote from: Thetruthseeker1234 on July 13, 2013, 08:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was also thinking of possibly keeping a backpack on me at almost all times, that has a couple pairs of different clothes, different identifacatoin, and a grand or two.<br /><br />That way if shit really did ever go down I could just move out quick.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I wouldn&#039;t do that... in one of those big cities, you never know when you&#039;ll be stopped and searched for no reason... well they use the excuse &quot;terrorism&quot;.&nbsp; Like I think NY calls it &quot;stop and frisk&quot;.&nbsp; So if you&#039;re carrying all that, not only will they steal your cash, you&#039;ll be busted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suggestion of becoming homeless:&nbsp; That&#039;s retarded... those guys get fucked with by police.&nbsp; Maybe you don&#039;t see it, but they do.&nbsp; Eventually you&#039;ll be arrested, fingerprinted and caught... especially once they see that you&#039;re not a junkie or crazy, they&#039;ll know something&#039;s off.<br /><br />It&#039;s only a matter of time until these big cities are constantly running facial recognition on all their cams... automatic license plate recognition is already all over.&nbsp; These cities have cameras everywhere.<br /><br />Good luck to ya though.

				The city I chose is big, but not LA, NYC, or Chicago large. Large enough to get lost small enough that there aren&#039;t many police officers.<br /><br />Also now I have another question. This is really very complex, but......<br />What is the most secure laptop I can buy? Preferably for less than 600$. I can buy it off eBay so any suggestions?<br />I plan on taking my opportunity to be invisible, to vend on the road. I just need to be extra cautious. Please don&#039;t give me your opinion on that as it is something that I am going to do.<br /><br />So this is really an opinion question, but what do you guys say is the most secure model of laptop?

				K, my one bit of advice on disappearing, and I&#039;ve done it several times now. Don&#039;t use f**king tormail! you need to be prepared to have absolutely ZERO contact with anyone. Tor may hide your IP, but it isn&#039;t too hard to unmask it. A few clicks and some crap from my USB, and you&#039;re done. Cut everyone off completely-no exceptions. Also, if you&#039;re gonna be a druggie, make sure you can handle your sh*t. Can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve gotten info out of people just by getting them high. You say and do stuff that you might regret when you&#039;re high, and that could easily get you found out. Finally, be ready to bolt at any time. The minute someone thinks something is up, you need to drop everything and get the hell out. No &#039;wait and see&#039; crap.

				You would be safer off buying all of your fake documents/ids in New York City.&nbsp; If you go down to queens and talk with some of the local hispanic gangs they will make you anything you need for a fair price and even get you into the system as a real citizen for a price.&nbsp; You can also rent apartments without questions about any personal income info or anything concerning yourself in the areas surrounding Manhattan.

				Allot of crimes have a statue of limitations, and its normally 5 to 7 years..<br /><br />Iv been to prison 2 times for 11months 1 time and little more the 2nd.. I was told by my Parole Officer if i decide to run on parole the west coast is one of the places there not gonna drive to extradite me..<br /><br />I max out my sentence next year so im not worried about it now, but i ran for 3 years almost, I stayed in the same town, but i used someone eles SS# AND DOB if i was ever ID and pulled with a friend.. <br /><br />I have done about 23 months alltogether and to be honest bro, if at the most your facing is 3 years, youll be outin 18 months or less. Prison is not like county, its allot more freedom and time FLYS by quick, U just dont go mixing your noise into business,dont gamble and try not to get involved with the Gangs..<br /><br />But againyou need to ask your Lawyer what is the STATUE of Limitations on your crime. Then stay gone that long. In my state there is no statue of limitations, they will stay on u til you are caught.<br /><br /><br />If your gonna stay in USA, Get&nbsp; A SS# CARD, a Fake ID from a Out of state area mataching the name on the ss# card, Maybe a student id, The more stuff u have that says your you,even though its fake, its more likel;y u willget away longer..<br /><br /><br />Bro&nbsp; if you MSG ME, I wanna ask you something about some of the fake id and SS# stuff u order&#039;d/<br /><br />I have REAL SS# DOB AND A DL # fromsomeone that lives in the state im in... Hes 23..<br /><br />Seriously MSG ME, I need to ask u something serious, cause i have a couple questions u could help on, annd since u read about all these u mayknow..<br /><br /><br />Also, U may wanna go to one of the 7 states where the DMV do not exchange INFO.. That way u can goin with a SS#(FAKE) SOME mail from a P O box openmaybe buy a fake birth cirtificate and u will be able to get a driver L.. Thats what im bout to do. <br /><br />Or just spend 1000 bucks on a scooter, U dont need insurence or a drivers L, just a scooter L.. its low key will get u point A TO B..

				Sorry I didn&#039;t read all 5 pages, so sorry if something is repeated.&nbsp; First, I sympathize for your situation bud.&nbsp; Second, I would think long and hard about &quot;fleeing&quot; - the paranoia and stress alone from laying low is enough to make someone do worse things than they would do normally.&nbsp; A better option, be it harder to deal with at an earlier time, would be considering to put the money you have saved to hire a good lawyer.&nbsp; Unless you have already been charged and convicted, a good lawyer could be the difference between jail time and minor probation.&nbsp; Realistically, every drug user has probably been in a bad predicament, and carelessly thought about this same thing.&nbsp; Speaking subjectively, really how much fun would it be just &quot;doing drugs and playing video games&quot; by yourself for the long term?&nbsp; It sounds like you have already began the preparatory steps in fleeing, but this could literally be one of those forks in the road of Life that could dictate the rest of your life.&nbsp; The easiest road at first glance isn&#039;t always the best choice, as you make the first turn ahead you may end up right back where you started...&nbsp; Best of luck bro!

				&nbsp; I realize I&#039;m rather new here an all, but I do believe the selling of TRUE credentials is strictly forbidden on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; OP...please do not listen to this dude or any word vomit he has spewed to you about using real ID&#039;s of 23 year olds.&nbsp; I will share some wisdom with you on why:<br /><br /><br />1) Using a 23 year olds credentials will get you busted almost as quickly as walking into a police station and confessing.&nbsp; If you plan to gain some type of employment you will not pass even a simple background check and a wannabe cop HR person is gonna blow the whistle on you.&nbsp; You may have &quot;real&quot; credentials, but you will know nothing about this persons history first of all. What if this dude has a parking ticket warrant....or WORSE???<br /><br />&nbsp; Secondly, even a minimal background check that works off of just a DOB and Name will provide a history of previous addresses.&nbsp; You will not know all of that unless you perform a background check on that identity first.&nbsp; You could do one on clearnet, but there&#039;s so many different services with different levels of security checks that you&#039;d just never be sure you won&#039;t get tripped up if a potential employer uses a different system or agency than the one you used.<br /><br />&nbsp; HR people are PAID to vet potential employees and most companies offer bonuses for finding identity thieves.&nbsp; They do a very good job.&nbsp; I said all of that to say this: If you do not know everything about the real person like mothers maiden name, State and County of birth, prior addresses, then you sir are shooting yourself in the foot.<br /><br />&nbsp; This is where a fake ID and a borrowed SSN beats out a real one....for work purposes anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Background checks work like this:<br /><br />&nbsp; HR does a criminal history search usually nation wide using a name and DOB.&nbsp; They can only return hits from public records such as criminal courts, newspaper reports, marriage certificate applications.&nbsp; If you provide a REAL persons info, you left holding the bag for their prior AND future transgressions.&nbsp; Dunno bout you bud, but that sounds pretty stupid to me.<br /><br />&nbsp; Now...HR will run the REAL persons SSN and do an address search.&nbsp; This provides two things to HR:&nbsp; All known previous addresses, and any credit applied for at those addresses.&nbsp; Again...you will likely know NONE of that information, which could blow your cover real quick.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Now...let&#039;s say you order an ID from a trusted vendor here on SR.&nbsp; They are all good, but my vendor is AmericaID for Licenses and NameDeclined for SS cards.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just assume that you can get a childs SSN.&nbsp; A child where you know the state/county they were born in.&nbsp; Let&#039;s assume that you have a SS card made with that number.&nbsp; <br />Let&#039;s further the story by again assuming you use that childs name on the ID but a random DOB.&nbsp; &nbsp;When you had these ID&#039;s made, they included the real middle name....only you add a hyphen and second middle name but no suffix ie: JR SR III).<br /><br /><br />Why will the above work better than a real ID?&nbsp; Well, let&#039;s take the first scenario:<br /><br />&nbsp; HR runs a Name, DOB search and returns NO RECORD.&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay...so far so good.&nbsp; Now...HR runs that childs SSN to check previous addresses.&nbsp; A child will have minimal moves so you will have already provided that information on the application (such as making sure you provide the childs hometown high school on your application).<br /><br />&nbsp; One thing people may not realize is that it is illegal for the Social Security Administration to give out ANY information when a minors SSN is queried.&nbsp; It is also illegal in all 50 states for any agency which deals in information....both personal and not.....to divulge ANYTHING about a minor...PERIOD.&nbsp; Minors SSN&#039;s are GOLD.<br /><br />&nbsp; Why the hyphen?&nbsp; Because I know of no verification place...including the Social Security Administration which will accept a hyphenated name and it&#039;s a loophole you can use to your benefit.&nbsp; Always use the hyphen on every application.&nbsp; It will muddy the waters a bit because it is so hard to verify which middle name is used most.&nbsp; Also, if there&#039;s a problem, HR will likely approach you about the middle name issue...thereby giving you a heads up that trouble may be close.<br /><br />Also...don&#039;t forget to put a job history around the area the child resides in.&nbsp; This is very easily done.&nbsp; Check around clearnet and search out &quot;Job Verification Services&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Spend the extra money on a service which also has a fake website online of the company they are verifying you work for...HR will check.&nbsp; This service is very cheap and will add to your credibility.<br /><br />Lastly....I&#039;d be wary of people in forums offering REAL credentials. Everything I state above will work because I have done it myself. <br /><br />DO NOT USE AN ADULTS CREDENTIALS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EVER!!!!

				&nbsp; I would also like to point out that ALL states exchange DL info.&nbsp; From time to time I hear people say that some states don&#039;t...but that is a MYTH.<br /><br />&nbsp; Alot has changed with Patriot ACT 1 and 2 as well as The National Defense Authorization Act.&nbsp; YOU SHOULD READ THEM.<br /><br />If you are going to try to help the OP, I wish you would give the proper information instead of mere conjecture.&nbsp; IDC if you are a hero member or not dude...your information is whack and perhaps you should research changes in the laws regarding the exchange of information between state and government agencies before you offer &quot;help&quot;. <br /><br />Do you think for one second that most states have changed their ID&#039;s to prevent forging at the cost of tens of millions of dollars per state and yet they cannot run out of state DL numbers??&nbsp; If that were the case, all one would have to do to run and never get caught is to goto one of those states and just live as yourself.&nbsp; You could get pulled over 10 times a day and the stupid keystone cops would never know!!!<br /><br />LOL...c&#039;mon man....that makes ZERO sense in the real world and besides that, how would one be CERTAIN that one of these states won&#039;t adapt and change to a nationwide system next week even if they weren&#039;t a myth????<br /><br />NO...there&#039;s too many variables to deal with there that you could negate simply by using semi-fake credentials in the way I prescribed above.<br /><br />Sorry for being dickish about it, but your information isn&#039;t helping the OP....it&#039;s hurting him.&nbsp; Since this is a community, I&#039;d like to help the dude out and perhaps my advice will help him succeed...where he can pay it forward to some other SR member in the future.<br /><br /><br />

				Eventually all of the deception, delusion and anxiety will catch up with you and the drug&#039;s won&#039;t help with it either, unless you are smoking weed to chill out few times a week, they will make your situation worse. It&#039;s one of the stupidest moves you could make. You want to be clearheaded when spearheading something like this you don&#039;t want to be on the edge from all of the coke you have been snorting especially when you constantly have to look behind your shoulder making sure you aren&#039;t followed, that nobody is talking about you or asking you questions you can&#039;t answer on the fly. Staying in your room all day also isn&#039;t a good idea, because your neighbors might get suspicious and in the worst case scenario just make an anonymous call to the cops. This may also cause paranoia and anti-social behavior. You want to be quite social (with the right people) so not to be seen as suspicious. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard of a serious crime which will go away if you flee for a few years and yours sounds like it&#039;s serious. Hopefully it isn&#039;t murder or anything of that nature, and just something like tax fraud or embezzlement but if you really need to start fresh, best bet is to fake your own death. <br /><br />You should really look into reading books relatable to your situation and looking at familiar cases of people who went away and never came back, or look at the cases where people were successful at disappearing but somehow got caught, learn from their mistakes so you don&#039;t slip up. <br /><br />The most successful people who do this are the ones who are able to live their lives like normal people, going shopping, going to movies, socializing living like a normal person would so not to arouse any suspicion (unless you are on the federal wanted list then go to Mexico or Russia where it&#039;s easy to disappear and nobody will really be looking for you).

				I can verify that there are situations where running for at least a year, while out on bond, can indeed reduce your sentence in the long run.&nbsp; The same is true for probation, provided your time on the run outlasts your probation period.&nbsp; You will eventually end up back in front of a judge, but with the right lawyer, you can improve your situation.&nbsp; As a lawyer once said: &quot;What&#039;s this about probation?&nbsp; The probation period is over.&nbsp; The fines are paid, a drug test passed, community service finished, all terms of probation were met aside from continuing to meet the assigned probation officer, due to fear of arrest&quot;.<br /><br />You never said whether you are running from a warrant, probation violation, or out on bond?&nbsp; If you are indeed out on bond, be very, very careful when the bounty hunters come looking for you.&nbsp; They move very quickly to turn your entire network of friends and family against you.&nbsp; They are guaranteed to eventually contact the friend you are emailing.&nbsp; They hound people they believe to have any information relentlessly, and will eventually target all of their friends and family.&nbsp; The pressure is immense, and they threaten everyone they talk to with fines and criminal charges.&nbsp; In a very short amount of time they will force a leak if ANY of your friends, family, or locals in general know your location.&nbsp; People in your former circle of friends and family who they believe might be holding back information, they will track down daily and question, at work, friend&#039;s houses, in the car on the road, wherever.&nbsp; People get sick of them very quickly.&nbsp; If anyone says anything to you about bounty hunters, cut all contacts then and there, regardless of how close to you they are.<br /><br />If it is indeed a true story, best of luck to you.

				Well for the statute of limitations bit, I can research it. Unfortunately, I am already away from my state so I can&#039;t really ask my lawyer anything anymore.<br /><br />Also, as an update everything is going great. I am currently residing in a hostel as it is much cheaper than a hotel. I secured an apartment and I can move in, in two weeks. It&#039;s a beautiful place and not to pricey. Once the final move is made I am basically done and safe as long as I don&#039;t fuck up.<br /><br />Anonymousaddict, message me about acquiring legitimate identification and SSN to boot.<br /><br />I would like to operate with 3 sets of identification. One completely fake. Ted Danzig for school ID and DL, name declined for SSN card. SSN is non existent, but matches the names birth place and date via the likely SSN code.<br /><br />Second, legitimate stolen ID. Full fledged and everything. Real SSN with it. I&#039;ll just have the card printed out by namedeclined. I&#039;ll make sure to know everything there is to know about the person I take.<br /><br />Third is one like madseason said.<br /><br />That totse archive is interesting. All of those articles are being sold for money on the road.<br /><br />Now about the emailing with a friend. This friend had no idea where I went. I might trust this man with my life, but anyone will eventually crack. So I made sure he has no idea where I am. I even leaked some disinformation that I am in a different country which he bought so, I don&#039;t have to worry.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks again everyone for all of the advice, keep it coming!!!!

				You will not have any trouble getting into Mexico with a warrant. You don&#039;t need a visa, no one will check. The only time it will come up is at a US border or Customs check. BUT one question, are your charges federal or just state?&nbsp; Because if they&#039;re federal all bets are off, those guys are relentless. State charges, just keep your head down and stay out of trouble, they&#039;re not going to be crossing state lines to search for you. Unless you are wanted for something really spectacular. <br />Really. I&#039;ve known people who were on the run for years. No contact. Learn all your info.

				One other thing, Why would you want more than one id? Just get a passably good one and don&#039;t put yourself in a situation where you will have to show it to a cop. Or find someone selling a birth certificate, with that you can get a real id. I know california dmv doesn&#039;t (couldn&#039;t) cross reference thumb prints. If your birth certificate is from out of state in my experience, (I&#039;ve done it) the person at dmv wont know what they are supposed to look like. Hell there is so much variation in those anyway. That&#039;s my two cents.

				hm, what disturbs me is that everyone seems willing to help this guy out without even thinking twice of what he has done.<br /><br />i dont know how the laws in the states work, so maybe when you have a courtdate set and not in jail/lockup right away, maybe its no serious crime.<br /><br />but i, for one, wont be helping anyone out to escape the law if i dont know what the person has done.<br /><br />i dont want to be considered an accomplice if the thing he/she has done is something awful/really bad.<br /><br />sure TOR is quite safe so the risk of you helping out getting caught isnt big, but i would not want to have that on my conscience if it was indeed something really had he/she has done.<br /><br />no, im not an LEA. :)

				Just figured I would update. I have already moved into my new apartment and I can&#039;t see anything going wrong. <br />Things are good for once in my life. If anyone can help me with either of these, I would be grateful.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to get two computers, one for maximum security and Silk Road vendor account, then one for gaming.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188802.msg1366487#msg1366487<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188433.msg1366469#msg1366469

				GOD DAMMIT! This thread is extremely entertaining. So many funny posts and to you truthseeker1234 I wish you the best of luck. Your plan seems decent but don&#039;t slip just because you&#039;re comfortable. Live day-by-day because every decision you make is important. Hope you pull it off and if all goes well I (and probably many others) would love some updates. Take it easy man and thanks for making my day lol.

				If I were you, I&#039;d spend as much time as I possibly could learning about wilderness survival and making shelters and such. Then just take off into the middle of bum-fuck nowhere in Montana or Idaho or something...<br /><br />Bring money, clothes, a couple knives and sharpening stones, a big axe, a tarp, some rope, and a SHITLOAD of books... just dig yourself a little cove in the side of a hill, miles and miles from any civilization. Have a little fire-pit and just read all goddamn day.<br /><br />Every few weeks you might have to walk about a dozen miles out to a store to get some food and water and such, but you&#039;d just be another weird homeless guy and they wouldn&#039;t give a shit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any possible way you could get caught doing this...

				Why is it that so many people think hiding in the woods is a good idea? Following your advise, he&#039;d be more likely to get caught, and also more likely to die. He&#039;s a drug loving, outgoing, computer nerd. Prison would probably be more pleasant than the self imposed solitary suffering you suggest.<br />A person wanting to disappear will be best off blending in. In the woods, your camp and fire stick out like a sore thumb. If you found a place isolated enough to avoid contact with wildlife officers/forest rangers etc, then you&#039;re far enough from help that you risk death if anything at all goes wrong.<br />People watch too many movies. These delusions of Rambo grandeur are as pervasive as they are short sighted.<br /><br />On another note, I would suggest not carrying an id at all. If you get contacted by leo and give a cop a name and dob of someone with a valid license/id, he&#039;ll check the computer and see that person has a valid license and no warrants. A friend might give you permission to do this. It would be better if you looked similar enough to that person in the event an officer has a computer in his car which could pull up the image. <br />Also might be best to use an unusual name. More than one innocent person has been arrested for sharing a name/dob with a criminal.<br />I&#039;ll reiterate that driving/or traveling by any means requiring id is a terrible idea.
