				Donatto is just fucking with you, I haven&#039;t had that problem but it may be due to a genuine error, or maybe they&#039;re still processing your deposit, although it&#039;s usually faster.<br />Bitfloor doesn&#039;t really have hidden fees... The median exchange rate is a bit higher than on MtGox but that can also be at your advantage if you&#039;re selling bitcoins.
