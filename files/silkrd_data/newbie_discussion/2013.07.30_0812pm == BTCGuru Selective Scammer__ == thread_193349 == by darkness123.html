				I am wondering if anyone can confirm/deny if they have ever been scammed by BTCGuru. His account was recently suspended for reasons unknown, and I am worried that it is because of a FE scam. I have yet to see reports on the road of anyone being scammed by him, but I am very worried that this is a selective scam setup and I am caught on the wrong end. I don&#039;t want to flame him yet because he does have good feedback (or did), but any ideas or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

				Mine was for a cannabis listing.&nbsp; We FE&#039;d. (mistake) I ordered early Monday. He had good communication, but then his account was switched over to a regular account and all of his listings gone.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t logged into the forums for 3 days....&nbsp; Appears to have just dropped off the face of the earth.&nbsp; I really hope I&#039;m just being over paranoid and that I will receive today, but I have to admit that I am getting worried.&nbsp;

				Yep, pretty sure we got scammed.&nbsp; Mail just came and still nothing.&nbsp; This was my last correspondence with him on Monday.&nbsp; According to him, my product should have went out the same day...&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, it should have been here yesterday or today at the latest.&nbsp; Priority normally takes 2-3 days at most to get to my location.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTCguru &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just getting caught up on shipping will have listings back up in a day or 2. have about 30 packages to pack which will take a day or 2. if you have finalized today b4 11(2 hours ago) then you package given to the shipping crew and should be on its way sometime today. if not then it will go out tomorrow<br /><br />wordbird &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you let me know when it ships? Also, just noticed all of your listings got taken down. What happened? You coming back? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
