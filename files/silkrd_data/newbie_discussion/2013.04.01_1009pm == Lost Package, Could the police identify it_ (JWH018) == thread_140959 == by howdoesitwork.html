				So I bought a smoking blend from a very trusted vendor, everything came and all was well so I decided to buy another 3g order of the stuff, but this package has been lost or intercepted I think. I was just wondering if LE would be able to indentify that there is JWH018 in the blend and nail me for it (if it was intercepted that is). I really just need to calm my nerves because I&#039;ve got another order of 100 25i blotters coming and I&#039;m really hoping they make it alright. It&#039;d be a damn shame to lose 60 bucks and such a great product. <br />Any advice on lost packages would be helpful to calm my nerves...

				Hey man!<br /><br />Dude for that small amount, don&#039;t worry. They aren&#039;t coming for that, sure they could test it in a lab, but highly doubt it. use a new address for next time

				that&#039;s kind of what I was thinking, but then I read a post on here today about how a guy got a knock on the door by two cops for a single gram of MDMA. I&#039;m just not really sure what to think.

				How long has it been? Have you contacted your vendor? <br /><br />As far as your other order, the vendor would have to be pretty incompetent to not be able to get blotters through the mail.

				The package shipped 2 weeks ago. I have contacted my vendor but I haven&#039;t got a response back yet. I have no doubts that the other vendor can get me the blotters but I fear all my mail will be opened (again IF law enforcement has found my first package).

				I would really forget about the product in the package. The chances are it was lost somehow, but you always have to assume the worst. Assume it was intercepted by LE. So if it was intercepted by LE you have to ask what their course of action would be. In a situation like this, when dealing with a very small amount of product, I would say it&#039;s highly unlikely they would do a controlled delivery on it. With that said, you never can be sure how they will decide to handle it. There are a lot of factors that play in to that decision. Which branch is handling the case, what their current workload is like, what their current priorities are like, etc. It also depends on which mail service was used. The USPS is different as they have Postal Inspectors who are aggressive and powerful government agents. The USPS is also a bankrupt entity that is quickly dying. That means there are a lot of people on the verge of losing their jobs so they want to try and justify a reason to keep them around. You have a large group of people, government employees, who have a vested interest in making as may interceptions as possible. The more headlines they can make about &quot;taking dangerous drugs off the street&quot; the easier it is for them to sell the idea that their positions are valuable and needed. A private shipping like UPS may just call their local police department. They also don&#039;t have near the vested interest in finding packages with illegal items. They are a for profit business, shipping fast and efficient is their main goal. I&#039;m not taking a stance on which shipping carriers are best, simply explaining the situations. Now with USPS, by law they are required to get a warrant to open a package. Without getting into it, there is a lot of &quot;grey area&quot; in the timeline in which a package gets opened for examination, and when the warrant is actually signed. Let&#039;s just say it all happens behind closed doors. A private company like UPS does not legally require a warrant to open a package. I wouldn&#039;t assume USPS is better simply due to the warrant law. Keep in mind the USPS absolutely looks for and wants to find packages containing illicit items. They also have powerful government law enforcement agents whose only job is to go after people sending banned items through the mail. Private companies do not have this. As long as the items their shipping aren&#039;t dangerous, blatantly suspicious, or problematic they just want to ship the highest volume possible. None of this is hard and fast rules, just generalizations. Regarding your package, I would probably refuse it even if they try and deliver it to you. Try and work something out with the seller.
