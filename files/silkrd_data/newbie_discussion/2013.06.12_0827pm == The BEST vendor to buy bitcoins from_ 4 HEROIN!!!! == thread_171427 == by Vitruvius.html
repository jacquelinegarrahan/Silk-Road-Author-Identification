				What follows is a true story. The names have not been altered because their true identity is unknown, and I won&#039;t be volunteering mine.<br /><br />So I&#039;m looking for a quick way to buy to BTC, with bitinstant cash deposit being down, and kind of a pain in the ass, and being tired of buying BTC at an exchange for one price, and then losing money 5 business days later when I finally get them. So I search SR, and I find a new vendor, goes by the name of 4 HEROIN. He&#039;s offering to sell BTC at no charge, none whatsoever, through MoneyPak.&nbsp; I&#039;m initially nervous, but I do it. I give him over $300, and boom, like magic I&#039;ve got current market price BTC instantly, without a single fee. 4 HEROIN initially proves trustworthy. But it doesn&#039;t end there.<br /><br />A few days later I ask if we can do the same with $250, he says sure. But then I&#039;m waiting on his message all day, it comes 8 hours later than what we&#039;d said, and he says he&#039;s been bedridden with food poisoning. OK, shit happens, he&#039;s proven to be a good bet thus far, and I give him the deserved benefit of the doubt. We set up an exchange for the next day.<br /><br />Next day, 4 HEROIN is always in contact, but he&#039;s having problems on his end. I&#039;m starting to get anxious, as I&#039;m sitting on a $250 MoneyPak that will take weeks to refund. But then after spending all day without anything working out, 4 HEROIN says to me he&#039;s going to put an ad out for a BTC-OTC transaction, and take the loss of whatever the exchange costs him, and still give me full market exchange rate, free of charge.&nbsp; Wow, right? Above and beyond, I couldn&#039;t believe it.<br /><br />So the next day comes, he&#039;s got someone lined up for a 3pm exchange, 3pm comes and goes, and I don&#039;t hear from him. But then, this is where the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed on SR takes place.&nbsp; 4 HEROIN says that if I promise to not spend the MoneyPak, he&#039;ll front me the coin so I don&#039;t have to wait anymore, and he&#039;ll figure out how to get the cash off the MoneyPak later, which is a bitch.&nbsp; What vendor fronts anything? Ever? So I promise him I won&#039;t, and POOF! My account&#039;s got $250 worth of BTC in it, free of any fee at all. The exchange rate alone is the best on the planet. Legit exchanges even take their piece, even if its small, AND 4 HEROIN HASN&#039;T EVEN BEEN PAID FOR IT YET!!!<br /><br />I of course cut the card up as soon as the BTC hit my account, and I now have a blood brother on SR.&nbsp; That was the kindest and most generous thing any vendor could ever do.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying he is going to front you BTC on a promise, but the moral of the story is there is a place to buy BTC without the wait, without the 15%, and without the uncertainty of actually receiving what you pay for.&nbsp; 4 HEROIN will do ANYTHING he can to help you, I promise you that.

				They say success is not measured by the amount of problems you encounter, but rather your response to those problems i.e. resilience. With that in mind, let me share my encounter with 4H (4_Heroin).<br />I purchased 1 g of 2cb, and since he was relatively new to the road, I asked for some assurance and perhaps extras. In addition to being extraordinarily responsive (like within 5 minutes, or less), he acquiesced my request and agreed to 1.1g&#039;s of 2cb + 7mgs of xanax. The product arrived in 2 days, except he sent the wrong product (Subutex) and sent my product to another buyer.<br />I messaged 4H, he asked if I wanted a FULL REFUND or RESHIP. I just wanted my 2cb, so I asked for a reship, which I received less than 2 days later. In addition to 1.1gs of 2cb, he also sent 1/8 of quality booms, some WoW blotter, and 7mgs of xanax. I am also in contact with the buyer who got my 2cb at first, and I am trading him for Subutex. The 2cb was AMAZING, incredible, add your adjective here. Choose 4H~!! :)<br />tl;dr = ordered 1g of 2cb from 4H, received 2.2 gs of 2cb, WoW blotter, 7mgs of xanax, and 1/8 of booms for under $100

I had $500 on mine and gave it to him yesterday.

				There&#039;s been a bunch of posts about him scamming. I highly suggest to anyone wondering if they got scammed or not is to check the balance on their cards. Go to the money pak site and go through the process of redeeming the card (don&#039;t worry, it will ask for confirmation before it actually does add to your account). If it allows you to redeem the card that means he didn&#039;t cash it out and he&#039;s probably just having some delays.

				I made it out with one card with a $200 balance. He got the other one cashed out for $200 though.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />He still hasn&#039;t read my message from two days ago. He used to read and reply to messages almost instantly. The last message didn&#039;t type or talk like him at all and I think his account has been hacked or he sold it or something. He never used punctuation or capitalization or talked to me like a customer instead of a friend in the month I&#039;ve been talking to him but he suddenly does yesterday when all these scam accusations are going down. He said he had my orders packaged up to ship out Monday so I hope he still got my stuff out even if he got hacked.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				I placed an order from this vendor a couple days before he was outed all over the forums for the MP to BTC scam (I got screwed like that by TwoMuch a few months ago lol). I had been looking for any info on whether or not his products shipped, as he had a bunch of good reviews on the listings, but as others are reporting now I&#039;ve had nothing come in after 9 days. I&#039;m about to take it to resolution as soon as I can. <br /><br />Can I just send a little fuck you this vendor&#039;s way, please. I never agreed to FE, but it&#039;s a real bitch having to sit around waiting to see my money back in my account. Pretty sure my order wasn&#039;t hedged.
