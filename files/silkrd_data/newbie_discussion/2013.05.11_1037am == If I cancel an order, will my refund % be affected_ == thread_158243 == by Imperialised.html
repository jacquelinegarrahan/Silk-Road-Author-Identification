				Yesterday I ordered from La Fuente<br /><br />Today I came back on here to check the status of the order and it has not yet been accepted. I took a look at the product page of the item I had ordered and noticed that it has been updated and now says that it does not ship to my location<br /><br />After reading a few bad things about Fuente in these forums, I am now a little worried that he may just accept my order and screw me, because I have to FE due to low stats. So I am thinking about cancelling my order. But even though my stats are low, I have 0% in refunds/autos and I do now want this to change<br /><br />Does anyone know if my refund rate will be affected, if I cancel my order?<br /><br />

				If you cancel, nothing happens. You may lose a little money if the order is hedged (4%) but that&#039;s all.

				Send the vendor a message asking whether he will still ship to your location as you ordered before he made the change. If not get him to cancel the order, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll affect your stats then

				Sorry to answer a question with another question but when you check your purchasing stats there is no cancelled order category. <br /><br />Total transactions:#<br />Total spent: #<br />Refund rate: # %<br />Auto Finalize rate: # %<br />Member For: # months<br /><br />Are there any additional stats kept on buyers other than those listed above. Inquiring minds want to know.<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				The only thing that happens is you get your money back. No stats are kept.<br />As someone said above, you may lose a bit of money if they rates have changed while you&#039;ve been in escrow, but that&#039;s it.<br /><br />If a vendor takes more than 4 days to ship an order, you&#039;re entitled to your money back no questions asked.

				Ok, thanks for the replies<br /><br />Judge - you&#039;re right in thinking that there are no counters for cancelled orders. But I was wondering if it would count as a refund and therefore possibly affect my refund ratio
