				In my opinion, the prices are high on SR, not only because of the risk for sending via usps, but also for the fact that you&#039;re paying for convenience as well.&nbsp; I mean how great is it that you can buy just about any drug on SR that you prefer, and don&#039;t have to drive anywhere to get it, have shady dealers come to your house, etc....&nbsp; &nbsp;You order it, go to sleep that night, and for the most part it&#039;s delivered to you mailbox the next business day.&nbsp; 100% completely Anonymous..<br /><br />If you ask me, there&#039;s no better way, and I don&#039;t mind paying extra for that luxury...

				That being said, when you pick up drugs off of somebody you know in real life, you also get to interact with somebody and possibly do drugs with them and have a good time. You don&#039;t have to worry about your product not arriving because it goes from hand to hand, also buying bitcoins is a pain in the fucking ass, it&#039;s always nice to deal with cash.

				I like SR for many reasons. The main one being quality. ;D<br />Then you get to choose from different vendors and read/listen to reviews ect<br />The escrow system is a nice tool to have<br /><br />I honestly feel the prices are fair (besides LSD and Coke)&nbsp; ;)<br />-Cheers!!

				Apparently none of you take your time to read through the forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are threads where certain substances from certain individual vendors are actually taken into labs and tested.&nbsp; Now if Im not mistaken, anyone can sell you a piece of white paper and claim it to be LSD, anyone can sell a pill or salt and whatnot and claim it to be X.&nbsp; Its not hard to disguise drugs these days.&nbsp; This is where SR comes in and is a brainiac way of knowing that something is 100% legit.&nbsp; Feedback, messaging a vendor, their stats, and the forums will also give all the information you need to find out.&nbsp; Nobody is going to tell you in general, you have to find out for yourself.....<br /><br />And ESCROW is the shit!

				That falls under the assumption that we&#039;re buying drugs off of dealers who don&#039;t care about the quality of their substance.
