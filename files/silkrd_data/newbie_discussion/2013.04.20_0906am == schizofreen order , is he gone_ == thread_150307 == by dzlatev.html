				I made an order with schizofreen last week, he told me that he shipped the package on monday and then he remove all of his products and hes offline for 3 days? Should I press the panic button ? :) <br /><br />I know 6 days is too early , but since he is close to me ( EUROPE ) I should have the package already , imo . It could be the post service here that taking longer than expected . <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Update 04-04-2013: In a few months I am selling here for 2 years, and for this I wiped my profile clean, no more delays or absence. Period. It&#039;s safe to order again without stressing about making it on time, cause that&#039;s the main issue I was having the past month. And this has caused many buyers not getting their package on time explaining recent feedback. I have everything in control producing this business in a successful way. It&#039;s all about keeping up.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is the last statement from his profile . That make me believe that he will not have troubles sending and making it on time. <br /><br />How to proceed?

				24.04.2013 - Today is day 10 ( excluding weekends ) and my mail is still empty. <br />-I know Shizo has good reputation here , but I cannot contact him since he is gone for about 7-8 days ( hope he is fine ) . <br />-Since I cannot contact him , I guess when its time to hit resolution button I have to contact SR crew. I am trying to avoid this .. but it seems that I will have no other option. <br />-This is my first order after being here for around a month , searching , gaining some information about how it works etc ... and really want to make some orders with positive ending . <br />-The number of bad feedback&#039;s increases on his vendor page , so I am a bit worried&nbsp; ( my package should be here already ) <br />-If I get my refund ( I hope I will ) , I will try CB as my second choice of pills .<br /><br />Summary : <br /><br />I will try once more if I get my money back to make another order and it fails again I will have to end my journey ! ( sucks , but even reading about how ppl receive their shits smoothly , if I cannot do it on my own I have to buy street shitz again . ) <br /><br />Will keep you updated of how this going. <br />

				Hi,<br />I have only 2 orders that never arrived and they were from Schizo at different periods. Same scenario, orders were supposed to be shipped but they weren&#039;t, 100 % refund by SR staff. Then Schizo went back 2 weeks later, I think he cleared everything. In my opinion the guy seems honest but completely unreliable...<br /><br />You should wait until the end of the week and then go in resolution if it&#039;s still not arrived.<br />Good luck ! <br /><br />WL

				I am in a similar situation with Schizofreen - 50 pills ordered on April 6, and package was marked in transit on April 9th. Today is April 29. <br />I have had 3-4 orders come through with Schizofreen before, but they all took longer to arrive than with other vendors. The last one took almost a month, and I had to hit the extend button. Then it actually turned out that he had forgotten to send it. But finally it arrived (wrong color pills, but what..). At the time at least we had communication. Now he seems to have fallen in a hole .. <br />Back then I said to myself that I would take a break buying from Schizo, but his recent &quot;I&#039;m back on track&quot; update (+his amazing offers) convinced me to place a new order again. <br />I agree with White Light: Schizofreen comes across as a really nice and honest person doing his best, but he also seems unstable. In his feed back lots of costumers mention that he has personal problems - I don&#039;t know what it means, though. I hope he is OK..<br />I went to Resolution Center a few days ago asking for 100% refund, just waiting for an answer now.<br />

				Thanks for sharing your experience here , guys! <br /><br />I am waiting for 100% Refund as well .<br /><br />I have no other experience at all and my stats of first purchase will be negative , but what can I do , also I have to think about what kind of issue vendor have. <br /><br />I still believe he is a honest person , because he is long enough here to be a scammer . But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that we are not getting our things. <br /><br />In that spirit , I have a side question you might be able to help me find an answer . <br /><br />According to user captainjojo on another topic about the amount of $/BTC we are getting back once we get our refund - he said this : <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If the order was $100usd and BTC was valued at $100 per coin at the time of the order, you would need 1 BTC to order the product.&nbsp; When the order is finalized, if the value of BTC is now $75 per coin the vendor would receive 1.3 BTC to equal $100 US$.&nbsp; If the order was cancelled you would get back 1.3 BTC.&nbsp; SR would take the loss of $25.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am still not getting something ( maybe its because i am not that fluent in English ) - Does this statement means that If the price of BTC at the time of placing an order is lower than the price of BTC at the time we are about to receive a refund will be in our favor ? Are we getting more BTC or at least the same amount of BTC we start the order with ?<br /><br />Thanks !&nbsp;

				It depends if the order is &quot;hedged&quot; or not.<br />Once you are able to login to SR again you can read the explanation in the Buyers Guide (go to your account page and see the menu on the right side). There you will find it explained well (I am no good at explaining :) ).

				-Due in was on 1st of may . How long it takes to SR to review my case? ( I guess it will be slower cuz of the attacks, )<br />-I will not deposit more BTC until I get a refund or atleast come to some agreement with Staff/Seller . <br />-It will cause a long period of not getting anything , but I will wait. <br /><br />-So overall 24 days waiting .<br /><br />Dzlatev

				I am currently waiting on 100. In which it is supposed to be 75 mortal kombats and 25 nintendos. I am still waiting, he says they are on the way. Schizo has always been a man of his word. Hopefully this comes out on the positive end. Ill update as im in the resolution center, he just asked me to extend it another 7 days which I accepted.

				Everyone runs into problems from time to time. He is working everything out and seems to back to his old ways (responding fast, shipping on time and restoring his faith in the community) I had an order that was backed up but he is making good on it which he could have just kept if he wanted to.

				Mine landed just as of the other day. Schizo held to his or her word and sent them out after going through issues. I feel its admeriable that the order was filled. Still the only vendor from over the pond who has never steered me wrong. I will be going through Schizo til the end. I mean its kind of hard not to fall off everyonce in a while when you have the best drugs on the planet.

				I had the same problem but after his vacation and order was finalized for close to six weeks he came through. Very stand up guy/girl. He/She could have just stopped responding but came through at the end. Nothing to worry about when using Schizo.
