				I&#039;ve heard the phrase: Beer before liquor, never been sicker. What about beer before shrooms? I&#039;ve had 4 beers. Will this fuck up a good trip, or should I wait until I&#039;m sober? <br /><br />Inquiring minds want to know. <br /><br />

				Not sure but I&quot;m going to guess it might be a good recipe to blow chunks. Shrooms from what I understand really need to be on an empty stomach.

				Beer before shroom, never any gloom.<br />Shrooms on beer, become a seer! <br /><br />I don&#039;t think it would cause excess gastric distress unless you&#039;re already sensitive to mushrooms.&nbsp; As for the trip, if I&#039;m drunk I tend not to trip quite as hard.&nbsp; BUT, it&#039;s all about the balance.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve only had four beers an 1/8 of shrooms will get you goin&#039; good.&nbsp; If you&#039;re wasted it will probably pull you out of black-out (politically correct - african-american-out) but you&#039;ll be too drunk to really enjoy it.<br /><br />I would make sure I had at least twelve more beers then eat the shrooms, or get the beer while you&#039;re coming up.

				I get to relaxed from shrooms to drink. I would probably fall asleep. I will have a few after the peak though while watching a sunrise.

				Never done this myself but I have seen literally dozen of people do so. Never seem to have any problems. No major interactions or anything. Might calm your trip a bit.

				Alcohol tends to dull the sparkle.&nbsp; Getting drunk is a waste of good shrooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;However it can be used to take the edge off if the comeup is too much for ya.

For me, alcohol is a recreational drug, while shrooms are for exploring mysteries.
