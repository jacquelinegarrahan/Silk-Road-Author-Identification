				had 2 not arrive coming from NL.<br /><br />Bit of a coincidence, no?<br /><br />1st vendor refunded half with no questions asked, item was 7g of amnesia, vendor is a somplete stand up guy, will deffs get my return buisness once I get a new drop address.<br /><br />2nd vendor said he would refund 50% of coins. We agreed after a 14 day extension. Month or so in total later and still nothing but 5 day waits between messages. Says it was shipped about 9 days after it was marked &quot;in transit&quot;. Was under review in the resolution centre and then SR support gave him everything, apparently he messaged them just before they made the decision and asked to give me a 0% refund! Item was 1oz amnesia (31BTC)<br /><br />Heres my purchasing stats. Who do you think should have gotten the money?<br /><br />Total transactions: 22<br />Total spent: à¸¿123.03<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 5 months
