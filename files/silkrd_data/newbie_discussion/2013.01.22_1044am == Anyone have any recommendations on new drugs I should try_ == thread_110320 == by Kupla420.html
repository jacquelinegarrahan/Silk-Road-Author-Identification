				I&#039;ve tried a whole lot of drugs and I&#039;ve found my favorites but I really just don&#039;t feel I&#039;ve tried enough things to truly understand all the possibilities there are. I&#039;m sure like everyone else on here, I smoke weed and I&#039;ve done prescription pills. Besides that I&#039;ve done coke, heroine, acid, ecstasy, shrooms, Molly, MDX, DOI, and DMT. I&#039;ve already decided I&#039;m going to try K and I&#039;m contemplating on salvia. I&#039;m interested in seeing what people think I should try. As a reference, my favorites I&#039;ve picked out are weed(obviously), ecstasy, and acid. And please no one recommend meth cause no matter how many people recommend it, I will never try it. Quite a few of my friends advised against PCP but I&#039;m interested to hear people&#039;s thoughts on that. I&#039;ll also accept variations of things I&#039;ve tried that you think I might not have tried and you think I might like.

				Well then one and only time I did DMT I did it wrong (yes you can do it wrong) so I didn&#039;t really have the crazy mental journey people say that get so I can&#039;t really reference it well though I do want to try it again soon so I can actually see it&#039;s potential. But if you do recommend salvia in connection with DMT then that sounds like it&#039;s really worth a try. And for peyote yeah I really am interested in trying that but I&#039;ve had a few people recently tell me that it gives you some really bad pains in your stomach when you&#039;re coming down from it. Is that true or no? Cause really I pick drugs over alcohol every time specifically cause I like to not feel like shit when I&#039;m coning down so if peyote does do that, then I really don&#039;t want to try it. Thanks for the suggestions

				GHB, HASH, OPIUM and definitely PCP (the horror stories are a lot of hype, just read up on it and know what you&#039;re doing, obviously.) If you are gonna try Ketamine, there is no reason not to try PCP as well, IMO.

				If you were anywhere near South America ( IE Peru , Colombia or anywhere near the Amazon) or any major American city with a cluster of Shamanic type religions , I would recommend Ayohuaca. Its a visin-incusing &quot;soup&quot; I guess is the best way to describe it. Chemicaly , it contains DMT along with a few other base psychoactives that are all natural. But I would only do it with full Shamanic experience , since most people who have done it (including myself) leave with a new understanding about themselves and the world around them.<br /><br />On the other hand , I would strongly suggest you stay away from any Spice , K2 or anything like that sold in headshops or gas stations. They produce the most chemical highs I&#039;ve ever had and the only time I&#039;ve felt I was going to die was on those evil , evil products. Avoid at all cost.

				Ah I forgot to mention I have smoked hash and K2 before also. Hash definitely is fun. K2 was interesting until the second time I almost died from it. So yeah I don&#039;t mess with K2 anymore. And that South American soup you&#039;re talking about I&#039;m pretty sure I seen in the documentary about DMT and it definitely does look like it&#039;d be a great experience. That&#039;s one of the biggest reasons I love acid and Ecstasy so much is cause every single time I always learn a little bit more about myself and I can feel that I&#039;m at least a little bit of a different person the next day. And ok I know I&#039;m gonna sound like a complete idiot here but I honestly don&#039;t know what Opium is. I&#039;ve heard it mentioned a lot but never actually found out its effects or how you do it. Hopefully this doesn&#039;t make me sound as stupid but that other one that one of you just suggested that (to me) is all those random letters, I have no clue what that is either. Can it be found on here too? I&#039;m still trying to see everything that&#039;s on here. There&#039;s just so many options it&#039;s unbelievable. Point me in the direction to find it please? Thanks for the input! Much appreciated. I will keep all those suggestions in mind when I go to buy some stuff. The biggest problem for me is since I&#039;m new I&#039;m trying to figure out what would be easiest to get away with getting through the mail.

				Salvia is shite! But definitely give it a go lol, plus its legally available in many places. Basically its like an instant K hole and lasts approx. 5-15 min <br />K is definitely worth a try, but go for the S-isomer rather than racemic, feels easier on the body at least for me and if you enter a K hole by accident, its much easier to handle.<br />If your contemplating K, you should definitely give MXE a go too, feels so nice. its like a&nbsp; mild opiate, mild stim, and mild K high and euphoria that lasts around 6 hrs. <br />And for PCP, personally never done it, but it seems like a dissociative that I would not be able to handle. However, ive heard great things about 3-meo-pcp and love to give that one a go.

				If you are feeling bored or stumped by psychedelics I would suggest trying different combinations of LSD, shrooms, K, and Nitrous (don&#039;t have to do them all at once). They all compliment and add to&nbsp; eachother very well and I would recomend MDMA in the mix but it is the same thing every time (well k and nitrous kind of are too) and has caused me a hellish depression that I would not wish on anyone.

				I don&#039;t know if by prescription pills you meant benzos or stims or viagra or what you meant but I would definitely steer clear from all benzos (xanax, klonopin, vallium, ativan, etc.) and ESPECIALLY stay away from powdered benzos. They will leave you looking back at months of your life saying to yourself &quot;what the fuck?!?!&quot; in the worst possible way.

				It&#039;s not enough just to &quot;try&quot; the drug. Keep at it til you get the full experience, especially in regards to psychedelics! You mentioned above that you only tried DMT once but obviously didn&#039;t break through. Freebase that 50mg right! Go on a trip from 300-400ug+ of LSD! Eat a heroic dose of shrooms; 5 dried grams! <br /><br />Okay, you don&#039;t need to push your limits if you don&#039;t want to. But you should definitely up the dosage to the sweet spot before saying, &quot;Been there, done that.&quot;

				Holy shit thanks for all the responses everyone haha. You guys are my kind of drugies! I always go hard in the paint when I&#039;m doin anything. Yeah I definitely need to give DMT another try that&#039;s for sure. And as for the prescription meds, xanax just knocks me out, I&#039;ve snorted and ingested both aderal, vyvanes, norcos, and different MG&#039;s of Vics. And yeah I definitely want to hippie flip too. I just candy flipped for the first time this past weekend. Took me long enough to get to but it was definitely worth it. I couldn&#039;t stop playing with my Orbit and when I wasn&#039;t doing that I was laying on the floor feeling the carpet as it moved around everywhere haha.<br /><br />And so you recommend doing Salvia before K but definitely try both? Sounds good!<br /><br />As for the 25i and 2C-B I do really want to try those cause my friend was telling me those are some insane ass trips. And since you can&#039;t give out personal information on here I will ask this way: My friend believes that all those research chems are legal in my state. So do any of you know the states (if any) that they are legal in? I tried looking it up but I couldn&#039;t find much info on it&#039;s legality and the times I did, they weren&#039;t very clear on it.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone! Also for the recommended drugs if you can point me towards a good vendor to buy off of that would be much appreciated also!

				If you have tried coke and ecstasy/molly, you should try 4-FA and Methylone.<br /><br />Methylone is a speedier roll-like experience, very euphoric.<br /><br />You&#039;ll need to take at least 100-150mg of 98+% pure methylone for an average young adult male.<br /><br />For 4-FA, I&#039;d suggest 200mg, but plan to stay up for the next 8 hours. It&#039;s very speedy and prolonged.

				Ive smoked Opium and did out of a hundred and twenty year old ivory Opium pipe. I can only describe it that as the most intense body high I&#039;ve ever had but the come down was kinda harsh , but not as bad as MDMA. More of just your body feeling shitty with minor &quot;bleh&quot; feeling.

				The only drug I&#039;ve ever had a somewhat bad come down from was heroin. I didn&#039;t necessarily feel like shit, my stomach just felt... odd I guess you could say. And the first time I did shrooms my stomach was killing me so bad the next day. So I have a feeling I could handle the Opium pretty well. To be honest with everyone, I was a late bloomer when it came to drugs. I didn&#039;t even smoke weed for the first time til I was 18 and thats all I did til about March of last year and almost everything else I said I tried was all within a 3 month period so it surprises me how well I can handle my drugs considering I&#039;m only about to be 20 now and if you look at it I really haven&#039;t been using for that long. I guess my body is just good at handling drugs cause even from the start I could do a lot.<br /><br />For example I first tried Ecstasy in like... April I think and I was at some party and I didn&#039;t roll to hard. Then I couldn&#039;t find any for the longest time. Finally my birthday came up in July and this kid was just spotting me a shit load of it. I started off with 2 BBP mints, waited about... 2 hours maybe only one and he gave me another and then about 2 hours later I snorted 5 of them at one time. I couldn&#039;t believe I handled that much perfectly fine considering that was basically my first time since the real first time didn&#039;t work. The rest of that week and the next I blew about 580 bucks on X just rolling basically every day and the only negative effect I was seeing was that my kidneys started hurting like all hell.<br /><br />So as you all can see I love to get crazy with my drugs. hah. I have good self control with it, so you guys can recommend some crazy shit for me cause I know I won&#039;t become and abuser. I appreciate all the crazy things everyone has suggested and I can&#039;t wait to try them. Especially 25-i. I heard that shit is intense as hell and I love to trip hard. I&#039;ve never gotten my ideal trip of just full blown hallucinating. My goal when it comes to tripping is at least one time I want to be tripping so hard that nothing appears to be what it actually is. I want to have literally no idea what is going on where I&#039;m at. haha. So if anyone knows a good remedy for that that won&#039;t cause me like 150 bucks for one day of that, that too would be greatly greatly appreciated.
