				Hi,<br /><br />I am really hoping enough people agree and this is implemented; the one thing that drives me mad on here as a buyer or vendor is that prices are only shown in BTC hence I am forever having to check with a converter prices of items etc.<br /><br />BMR price display makes much more sense and is easier to follow and manage as regards pricing.<br /><br />Any one else agree ?

				indeed.<br /><br />However, the following applies; The US dollar is not the only currency in the world. Bitcoin changes at a constant and often dramatic rate.<br /><br />The cost to simply show the price in all 4 major currencies would make the purchase experience so much simpler. Nothing to calculate in your head and or work out. BTC USD EU GBP....<br /><br />Buy on BMR and see how well it works and how simple it is.

				I was thinking that it would be nice if they had somekind of currency conversion. I didn&#039;t know about the USD thing. It&#039;s true that we pay in BC, but I always need to convert it to a currency to grasp how much it really is.<br />Is having a converter open in Chrome, etc while using Tor a bad idea? I mean operating Tor at the same time as an unencrypted browser.

				no, its a not a problem.<br /><br />You can access preev via tor anyways.<br /><br />I just think its more than a smart, effective, cheap and hugely beneficial update to SR if such a simple mod was added.<br /><br />Check you BMR and you will see the difference, its so easy to browse through, see what is what, exactly what it costs, current rates are displayed all the time too.....<br /><br />

				BMR has its advantages but so does SR. sometimes you just have to get used to the interface. and ways things are handled by the page.<br /><br />anyway, i support the idea of more currencies on SR.

				nice one thanks,<br /><br />Ya I sure hope they do, there is little I can fault SR on. And often it can seem like an attack.<br /><br />It&#039;s not. I too run an online business and get tons of feedback from users/customers and it should be welcomed as your customers can have some really great ideas !! :0)

				Simple math ?<br /><br />Calculating an ever changing currency fluctuation between 4 currencies ? Hell, maybe for you and respect but for most, I would say its not.<br /><br />Same for vendors too, not everybody is US. I deal all over and in many currencies and my time is better served forging documents for the SR community not pissing about with my calculator and or switching tabs to converters just to figure out what sales/costs/payments are.<br /><br />Get its sorted SR....ffs..simple<br /><br />

				yeah, acutally it is simple math, thats why it shouldnt be hard to implement. And its a hassle to always check or calculate when you compare different stuff with different prices (maybe dividing the amount again to have the price per gram or so).<br />and your own currency is just much more familiar to you. so you know straight away how high the price is.<br />I have to deal with a lot of currencies the whole time aswell and of course normally its no big deal to just calculate, even without a calculator. But as soon as you are on a market or in a stressful situation somewhere abroad you need much more time than handling your own currency which is daily business for years....<br />I would love the feature! Best would be to have a small button next to amounts displayed where you can just change it straight away or when you go over the currency with your mouse see it in BTC or so. But even the option which is now only USD in some other currencies would be big improve already :)

				Thanks for browser info. <br />I&#039;m pretty new here. Where&#039;s a good place to start reading to get more info on Tor and general security issues? On this forum, or just in general. I&#039;ve been poking around but wonder if anyone can point me in a specific direction

				Disagree.&nbsp; I think that DPR realizes that bitcoin was meant to be a standalone currency, and until people start treating it as one, it never will be. Why do you have to keep checking the price of bitcoin in usd?&nbsp; Just purchase some bitcoin, store them in a wallet, and use them as you need them.&nbsp; You can easily compare one vendor&#039;s prices in btc, so it is simple to tell who is giving you the best deal, regardless of what currency you are using.<br />Displaying every product in every common currency is not only pointless, it would waste page space, and make bitcoins look irrelevant.&nbsp; <br />The sooner we free ourselves from dependence on state controlled currencies, the better off we all will be.

				I still say that keeping track of currencies and bitcoin value is simple math. Have you not seen the updated charts that display the value of btc in every currency that it is available in?&nbsp; So, you lock one screen or a sep device on the changing value and the other on the work at hand. Then your done. Pretty simple huh?&nbsp;
