				Hi everyone, <br /><br />I&#039;m new to this and have spent soooo much time trying to figure all of this out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned so much but there&#039;s one last thing that I&#039;m trying to get - how to get bitcoins as anonymously as possible, and what email services to use.&nbsp; Can you all help me?&nbsp; I&#039;m getting near the end of my rope on this, and starting to feel like I should just go to the next festival in my area to find what I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; Been there, done that, and I actually feel like SR is a safer way to do this, if I can get it right... <br /><br />Here are my questions (I&#039;m planning on buying bitcoins with cash through local bitcoins):<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp; What email service should I use (mostly so I can register on localbitcoins), and should I use Tor to access it?&nbsp; I made a safe-mail.net account using Tor, but when I made a localbitcoins account with the safe-mail address, I couldn&#039;t activate.&nbsp; In safe-mail, I&#039;d click the activation link and it would forward me to localbitcoins, which would give me an error saying it was the wrong activation code.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing this is because I was using Tor to access the safe-mail activation email from localbitcoins, and the two websites didn&#039;t see the same IP address (or something).&nbsp; I also had made a yahoo email with fake info, but everytime I logged in using Tor I got this kind of alarming message notifying me that it didn&#039;t recognize my IP address.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like that and junked the account.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; If you were to meet someone on localbitcoins and buy bitcoins with cash, would you give them your Silk Road wallet address directly, or would you make another wallet and have them transfer the bitcoins there, and then transfer them from your wallet to silk road?&nbsp; If you suggest an &quot;intermediate&quot; wallet, what wallet would you use?&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer to go direct to SR because then you don&#039;t need to sign up for a wallet (and provide an email address or other info), or have the bitcoins pass through my computer. <br /><br />If you all can help me clear up these, it would be so appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance...
