				This thread will be for those who don&#039;t want to get to 50 posts to review my gear/ask public questions/give feedback/etc. Please try and refrain from post-count increasing in this thread if you don&#039;t mind...<br /><br />My Profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e00fed951f<br /><br />4/11/2013<br />Now selling CLOUDSURFER MDMA domestically (US-US), in limited quantities. Note, first shipments will go out 4/15 (I&#039;ll be rolling 4/13 on his lovely gear!)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/faa7a9d7a8<br /><br />I personally only roll on CS&#039;s MDMA, and it gets rave reviews from everyone online and in the &quot;real world&quot;. Some reviews:<br /><br />&quot;On a scale from 1 to 10, where<br />1 = &quot;hey this shit aint molly!! this is table salt you fuckface!&quot;<br />10= &quot;the best ever mdma experience, Just like my first time!&quot;. Excluding the first time, of course.<br />CloudSurfer:<br />TEN. Yes, 10. That rank on the scale exists because these were the words coming out of the pigs&#039; mouths.<br />Those same words, from 7 pigs, 3 being very experienced, one being a fist timer ( so technically does not count ) and the rest with average experience.&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1006.msg949266;topicseen#msg949266<br /><br />&quot;I would have to say from personal experience that CloudSurfer has the best MDMA by far. It&#039;s truly on a level of its own and I&#039;ve sampled most of the big names on SR. I haven&#039;t had the chance to personally consume LuckyLuciano&#039;s yet, but I have heard it&#039;s up there, as well.&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1006.msg897056;topicseen#msg897056<br /><br /><br />This is completely un-cut, just like I received it. Because of the purity, lower dosages are advised.<br /><br /><br />

				.5gram Cloudsurfer MDMA plus 2 5ml vials liquid GHB (10ml total). Great for two people to dose, redose, finish off with 2 smaller doses or 1 large dose GHB each. $80 + ship.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7391a586e5

				New listings going up for white (not cloudsurfer) MDMA. *Almost* as good as CS&#039;s, this is probably just my opinion, but I got it cheaper so I&#039;m passing savings on :)<br /><br />1 gram http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6c203a5b84<br />3.5 gram http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f396803d02<br /><br />Oh, and if you don&#039;t hang on reddit, I had a contest there and we&#039;re going to have some pics very soon :D :D<br /><br />(Clearnet) http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dyp2o/surely_the_op_will_deliver_nsfw_review/

				For what it&#039;s worth guys, I highly recommend TGM&#039;s Cloudsurfer batch, easily in the upper 80s in terms of purity, easily. It is almost impossible for me to imagine getting better MDMA elsewhere, since MDMA production generally can&#039;t yield a higher purity (unlilke other substances, such as DMT, which can be as pure as 99%), and the price is better than the street price for equal grade stuff, at least for me, so I recommend TGM highly. So for those of you who know me and trust me from my other threads, namely those on Cannabis reviews and BTC trading reviews, I&#039;d suggest giving TGM a shot. I felt like I should give my 2c, since I see a lot of low-grade dishonest vendors getting way too much business while the high-grade honest vendors get scraps (not necessarily in this case, but in general). <br /><br />P.S. I use MDMA solely for meditative purposes, to feel. sublimate, and transmute my sexual energy, not for partying, nor do I recommend it for partying, but you all can do whatever you want ;)
