				People in New York aren&#039;t too big on a hot dog with ketchup. They&#039;re garnishes tend to be based on mustard. There are some vendors that, I swear to god, get a little disgusted when someone orders a hot dog with ketchup.

				I don&#039;t even really like them. They don&#039;t taste anything like a real hot dog. They&#039;re really more like hot dog pickle, if you think about it.

				I think it want it flamebroiled. Maybe grilled. If it&#039;s a Polish sausage, that fella is definitely going to be grilled. A smaller guy is going in the broiler. For the love of god, why am I doing this to myself.

				If I have it sent express it may still be hot when it arrives. Oh man... I just lunched out on some Wheat Thins, but after think about hot dogs again...... Oh man, I still really want one. I&#039;m not even hungry anymore. I really went to town on those fucking Wheat Thins, but still. I&#039;d make room for an overnighted hot dog.

				There are spam posts for this btw. Hot dogs are great straight up and plain, and the 50 post rule is to eliminate the bothersome noobs, children, scammers and other riffraff that arrive here with the intention of only doing stupid annoying wrong things. Get into a legit thread and suddenly you dont have to worry about that post limit. You live in NYC(I presume) and are complaining about getting food? I was under the impression that wouldn&#039;t be so hard. Overnight a hot dog... Maybe we can corner the SR food market&nbsp; &nbsp;;) jk have fun spamming around ive seen you in every thread im active in ATM

				Are the SPAM threads the ones that say SPAM in thread title?<br />Man, have you had that shit? That shit is fucking delicious too. God damn. I mean, really. A spamwich with some sliced yellow onion, Velveeta, mayonnaise, iceberg lettuce, maybe a little mustard.... now that&#039;s a culinary masterpiece, right there.
