				Let&#039;s say that in theory, I have access to a credit card that isn&#039;t connected to me, or close relations. Is there any way I could use it to buy bitcoins?&nbsp;

				I am sure you could. It is no different then any other kind of CC fraud. You would buy them then tumble them and they would be untraceable.<br /><br />The deal is DPR and many others (including myself) do not condone that kind of stuff here. If your actions cause harm to others then take it somewhere else.

				FIRST OF ALL, i do not condone nor approve of what you are doing, this could really ruin someones life by stealing their CC, but its your life, live it however you want to, just know i do not approve of anything that could harm others.<br /><br />in theory I hope it isnt a starving family who needs the credit card to buy cancer medicine for their 3 year old son who is also a transvestite alcoholic.....<br /><br />but im not here to judge, you better not steal my shit though or ill hit you<br /><br />go to VirWox and make an account, and link the credit card to a paypal<br /><br />2. is the credit card a mastercard? visa? citi? it matters cause some have online fraud protectors where you have to enter your social security # to use it<br /><br />3. click deposit money and deposit as much as you possibly can under the paypal option and then the regular credit option<br /><br />4. in the left corner you should see something that says USD/SLL or USD/Lindens<br /><br />5. buy as many lindens as you possibly can, and then go back to the area and click BTC/SLL and it will give you the option to buy bitcoins using your linden dollars<br /><br />6. send the BTC to your Silkroad wallet or your personal wallet and bravo<br /><br />7. send bitcoins to me, jk buddy, unless you want to<br /><br />USE TORBROWSER IF THE CREDIT CARD IS STOLEN SO YOU CAN STAY SOMEWHAT ANONYMOUS, IM SERIOUS<br /><br />if you have any soul you will stay under 50$, even the worst credit card companies will reimburse someone for credit fraud will work for 50...<br /><br /><br />
