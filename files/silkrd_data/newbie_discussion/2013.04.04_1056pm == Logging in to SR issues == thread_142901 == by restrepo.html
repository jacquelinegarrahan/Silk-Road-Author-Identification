				I&#039;ve been a member for almost a year but use the site sparingly.&nbsp; Every single time I try and log in it fails.&nbsp; I have to keep trying, sometimes 20-30 times before I am successful.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong, is it just me?&nbsp; Or does everyone experience this problem?&nbsp; I have no issues logging in and navigating the forums justb the main SR site.&nbsp; Sorry if this question has been asked before.<br /><br />Also a second question: When deciding on a whether or not to buy from a vendor what is the best way to search the forums for info?&nbsp; I have found that often the search bar doesn&#039;t always work as it should.&nbsp; Is there some easy way to find each vendor&#039;s forum thread and does it even exist for all vendors?<br /><br />

				I think I might have tried that a few times in the past with limited success.&nbsp; But can that really be the issue if this happens to me 100% of the time?&nbsp; I have never logged into SR first time round.&nbsp; Do others not have this issue?

				I asked DPR about it the other day when someone else was having that problem.&nbsp; His suggestion was to quit tor and restart.&nbsp; If you continue having that problem, post in the Customer support subforum here.

				OK well thanks for your help.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try restarting TOR next time.&nbsp; And can&#039;t post to customer service unfortunately, what with being a newbie and all.

				My bad just realised newbies can post in customer support.<br /><br />Anyone have any advice on my second question?&nbsp; What is the best way to research a vendor and product before making a decision.&nbsp; I have tried typing the vendors name into the search bar in Rumor Mill and that often doesn&#039;t come up with much or in some cases comes up with some error about me having searched within the last 5 seconds (I hadn&#039;t).&nbsp; For example, try searching the vendor &quot;chillzon3&quot; using the search box.&nbsp; Nothing comes up.&nbsp; I had to then search more generically using the term &quot;UK diazepam&quot; but then wade through hundreds of posts to find specific info I am after.&nbsp; Is there no simple way to find a thread about a vendor?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t each vendor have one official thread which is linked to from the main SR site?<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m rambling, but if anyone could advise on their process of vetting vendors before purchasing that would be great.
