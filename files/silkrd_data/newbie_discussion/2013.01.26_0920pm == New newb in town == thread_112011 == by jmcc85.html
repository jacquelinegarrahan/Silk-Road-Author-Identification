The drugs in Scotland suck.&nbsp; Looking to make my first purchase on Monday and really excited, feel like a kid at christmas .&nbsp; It sure is hassle getting them bitcoins.&nbsp; Anyone here use barclays pingit to buy them

				I have no experience with barclay&#039;s but I have used coinbase and bitinstant though bitinstant recently underwent a site redesign and it seems everyone and Krushev&#039;s mother are having a bad go of it lately. You could try local coin but you may have to take a trip into England to meet someone with coin or maybe not. I am largely ignorant of the Scottish bitcoin market and am showing my ignorance in this post. Best of luck to you young man and I hope you are able to procure the things which ye seek.

				No I&#039;ve only used localbitcoins.com. I found a dude and gave him cash. Had the coins in two hours. Try that site and just message the person that you want to give them cash and an address nothing more. seemed the safest against LE to me. Just hope the dude doesn&#039;t screw you. Make him transfer the coins on his smart phone in front of you. Hope this gives you an idea and help.
