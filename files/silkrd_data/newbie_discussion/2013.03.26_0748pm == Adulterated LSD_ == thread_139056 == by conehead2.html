				Hi. I&#039;m not a newbie but lost my old account information. It was called &quot;conehead&quot;, appropriately.<br /><br />Some history:<br />I&#039;ve dosed LSD 5-7 times in my life, but all 10 years ago. I done many hallucinogens including salvia, DMT, 2ci-nbome, DXM, MDMA, 4ACO-DMT and certainly others I can&#039;t recall.I&#039;ve done LSD about 5-7 times. Every time I had exactly the same kind of effects. It was easy to tell it was acid. Sometimes I would get this &quot;chemical ass&quot; taste the day after which made smoking cigarettes impossible. But I digress...<br /><br />I have some hits that were sold as very strong LSD doses.<br /><br />I took 1 tab and had it in my gum for about five minutes.There was no complex taste or chemical burn like from 2ci-nbome complexed blotters. It was tasteless as best I can recall. I decided to swallow it. I&#039;ve never swallowed LSD, but thought the effects were still the same.<br /><br />I dosed at 11pm.<br />T+ 1:00 - Little effect. Cardio effects building.<br />T+ 2:00 - Heavy cardio effects. Light visuals<br />T+ 3:00 - Little change. Flushing from cardio feel very similar to 2ci-nbome however this chemical is clearly not 2ci-nbome. LSD would perhaps causes these effects but I didn&#039;t have them before when I was younger and more fit.<br />T+ 4:00 - At this point I start to seriously question the substance. There is absolutely no head-trip. There is none of the fascination I had earlier in life where things seemed super complex but all made sense. None of the this is present. I&#039;m just as sober-headed as when I&#039;m on 2ci-nbome. It&#039;s just a weak visual effect with weak CEV&#039;s.<br /><br />T+ 11:00 still tripping although the effects have faded considerably. The body buzz that was much like the 2ci-nbome I took so much of last summer is still around, but weak. I get to sleep<br /><br />I sleep for 5 hours and wake up, still tripping. I&#039;m much more sober now, however I still have weak CEV&#039;s. Mostly like sheets of repeated patterns flying around and overlayed.<br /><br />I also found the effects of sexual arousal which would have been totally the furthest thing from my mind when I took LSD before. The cardio effects made it hard to urinate because the stream would stop or weaken unexpectedly.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to purchase test kits but I the best that does is show it is one of a variety of chemicals, many of which I&#039;ve never taken.<br /><br />So, I wanted to get your input. I wish there wasn&#039;t a 50 post min... That&#039;s fucking crazy.

				Doses of LSD just above threshold can produce these effects, it can take higher doses to get pushed into the headspace you have come to expect from LSD.<br />However the duration suggests that you may have taken a DOX compound. Perhaps a small dose of DOC?

I&#039;m also not some raging psycho bent on SR vendor destruction. haha. Sure I spent ~$30 a hit for several hits of what seems to be an RC, but I&#039;m not going to start a fucking war over it. I am just trying to ID the damned thing so I can know if I should ever eat it again. I&#039;m done with RC&#039;s. I was really looking forward to real LSD. The crazy acid brain effect. This was like taking 2ci-nbome, with weaker visuals, and less body load (less sweating). Although I took 2ci-nbome in doses up to 8mg :X<br /><br />However the test kits won&#039;t tell me exactly what&#039;s in it, and I believe the use of multiple chemicals can cause reagent test kits to show LSD even if it is not, by blacking out the adulterant kit and using some RC analog of 5meo/4aco/etc to activate the LSD test kits.<br /><br />Thanks for the reply. I appreciate your input.

				You can distinguish between LSD and DOX with Marquis and Ehrlich&#039;s Reagents. <br />DOX will turn the colour of the corresponding 2C-X compound with Marquis. Eg- 2C-B and DOB will turn green.<br />Ehrlich&#039;s Reagent will turn purple in the presence of indole alkaloids.<br />The relatively high dose of tryptamines vs LSD/ DOX means it is unlikely that your LSD is adulterated with another tryptamine. <br /><br />In summary- if Marquis is negative and Ehrlich&#039;s Reagents gives a positive result then you most likely have LSD.

I misunderstood the testing procedure (the color changes). However it seems possible that someone could use multiple chemicals in fake LSD tabs to make it seem to test as LSD.
