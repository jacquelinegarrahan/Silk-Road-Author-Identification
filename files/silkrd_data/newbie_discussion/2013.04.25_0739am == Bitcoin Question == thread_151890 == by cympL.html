				Title: <strong>Bitcoin Question</strong><br />

				I&#039;m very new to this site and the opportunities it offers and I probably dove in headfirst without checking if the water was deep enough. But Here&#039;s what I did:<br /><br />I made a bitcoin purchase with cash dropoff (moneygram) to a bitcoin address (the one provided to my SR account) using bitinstant. After about 24 hours and no bitcoins were added to my account I began to look deeper and realized I may have made an error.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking I should have used an intermediary to buy bitcoins and then having them, sent them personally to my SR account? Is that right? Can I use bitinstant cash drop to my SR bitcoin address or is that just too simple? If that&#039;s the case can anyone guess where my money went?<br /><br />Thanks for any insight or advice.

				You can easily and safely send bitcoin from an exchange like bitinstant directly to SR. The only thing you should watch for is to be sure the deposit address is copied over exactly.<br /><br />I would check your history in Bitinstant to see what the address you sent it to was and confirm it is the one in your SR account. <br /><br />If your BTC isn&#039;t in your account by now it is not likely to show up. Usually only takes an hour (a few at most). It is always best to practice transfers with a few fractions of a BTC to make sure you have the process down before sending a larger amount.<br /><br />Sorry man, hopefully it wasn&#039;t a large amount.&nbsp;

				You did the procedure correctly, maybe now it&#039;s time to double check your SR address with the one that you sent it to. SR has been down all day because of DDoS so I would give it a few more hours and then see where things go. As the guy above me said, hopefully it wasn&#039;t a large amount. I wish you good luck!
