				I just joined SR. Fairly new to the whole thing, but love the concept of a revolutionary digital market such as this. I attempted to buy Xanax powder from CostCo, but my order was cancelled by the vendor.&nbsp; :( It says on the buyer&#039;s guide that vendors make their decisions based on your order history and feedback. How am I to make a purchase if I&#039;m fresh on the market and have no previous purchases?? Did I miss something, or is this a catch-22? Does it very from vendor to vendor? Costco has amazing deals, I would really like to get in on them before they undoubtedly dry up. Seasoned patrons, please help! All ideas welcome.

				I was afraid of that.

If you have been on SR for less than 90 days or have total orders less than $1000 contact me before you order so you donâ€™t waste either of our time. If you have less than $500 spent on SR don&#039;t even waste the time in messaging me.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s why it was cancelled. It varies from vendor to vendor but reading their profiles in their entirety will stop this from happening again. And yes, not using PGP will deter some vendors from accepting your order. They usually state this as well on their vendor page. It isn&#039;t that hard to figure out and the added security is pretty important to most vendors/buyers. It would behoove you to take the half hour or so it takes to download, learn and set up PGP.<br /><br />

				Let me start by saying that I believe I have successfully learned to navigate GPG (actually not very hard at all :-[). Big major shout out to Pine for the help. ;) And I have also found a vendor known as T9 who will happily work with me! I will def be patronizing them, but would very much like to work with Googleyed. Their deals are INSANE. Just waiting to hear back on my inquiry of possible business; fingers crossed. Thanks again for the advice and info everyone! I feel like you pulled me back from the edge of a potentially hazardous, ill-conceived mistake. Much appreciated&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />~DocFeelGud~
