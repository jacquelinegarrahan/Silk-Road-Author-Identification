				I&#039;d like to put in a good word for SuperSun, who carries BTH and coke. He&#039;s been on SR about a month. I bought some of his previous stock of BTH. Sticky, smelled vinegary. Excellent quality. Shipping was fast, communication was good. A good experience all around, I&#039;d use him again. A couple of other nice things: he&#039;s willing to sell in small quantities, for those of use who don&#039;t use a lot. I bought 1/4 g. He doesn&#039;t require FE for newbie buyers.<br /><br />One thing I wish he&#039;d change: he uses an external website for PGP, and while you can use it, too, and it&#039;s easy, it&#039;s not compatible with the usual PGP software, and it exposes your data to an external site.<br /><br />But that&#039;s a minor complaint. Overall, the transaction as great, and I&#039;d use him again.

				Here&#039;s the vendors I&#039;ve had success with so far.&nbsp; Currently 5/5 on transactions with $105 spent, with orders #6 &amp; 7 in transit currently to bring my total spent to ~$200.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of my orders have been domestic (USA to USA).&nbsp; Haven&#039;t been brave enough to try international and I need to revamp my own computer security protocols for using SR before I do so, but going to try CloudSurfer for MDMA and jerseycow for LSD once I take care of the security portion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mushroomgirl - P. Cubensis &quot;Golden Teacher&quot; strain mushrooms.&nbsp; Very very good quality and she is a pleasure to work with. <br /><br />RedHempfield - 2mg DOC and 850ug 25C-NBOMe on (separate) blotter.&nbsp; I think he stocks a few other things here and there, but this is what he usually has.&nbsp; Evenly laid blotters and very good stuff.&nbsp; Dosage seems very accurate.&nbsp; Will continue to order from him for sure.&nbsp; <br /><br />X4U - Stocks X pills imported from overseas.&nbsp; Always has clean, high quality rolls.&nbsp; Only MDMA and filler/binders.&nbsp; Got red question marks ~180mg each.&nbsp; Shipping is fast and stealth, communication was great.&nbsp; Product was stellar.&nbsp; Currently has Dutch Purple Party Flocks in stock estimated between ~196-218mg.&nbsp; Currently waiting on these.&nbsp; <br /><br />rogerpete - Seems to have the best quality and best prices for DMT on the Road.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a lot on his pages. He is a chemist IRL with 10+ years of experience.&nbsp; He synthesizes his DMT from tryptamine instead of extracting it from plants.&nbsp; It is 97.8% pure as measured by HPLC (analytical chemistry equipment).&nbsp; &nbsp; Also currently waiting on my first order from him.&nbsp; Should arrive in the next day or two hopefully.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				awseome posts.<br /><br />Superior vendor I&#039;ve dealt with would be kush411. Handles orders immediately and helps with any annoying newbie questions thrown his way. <br />Felt that price was a little high so I tried 2 others. First one was a little cheaper and then again so was the quality, and the second didn&#039;t even show (although he/she is currently trying to rectify it).

				It has been a little bit for me, and I know they are gone now, but Rocker was one of the easiest people to deal with.&nbsp; Quick responses, friendly, and a great product shipped quickly.&nbsp; I had a great experience with one other vendor late last year, but I honestly can not remember their name.&nbsp; I got some amazing Pandora&#039;s Box from them, and it was well-cured, trimmed and SUPER BOMB.
