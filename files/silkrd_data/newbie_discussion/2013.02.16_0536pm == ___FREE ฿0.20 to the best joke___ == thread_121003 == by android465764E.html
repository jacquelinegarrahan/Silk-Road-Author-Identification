				I&#039;m bored. So....<br /><br />I have a spare ฿0.20 in my account, and in the interests of SR community spirit I&#039;d like to give it away. <br />It&#039;s not much I know, but every penny helps. lol. <br /><br />BUT..&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t get it just coz you&#039;ve asked for it. <br />This is not a first come first served situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is how it&#039;s gonna work...<br /><br />You have to post a joke. <br />Doesn&#039;t have to be a punchline, knock-knock, man walks into a bar, etc.. type joke, necessarily - just something that would make a person laugh. Although one-liners are sometimes the best jokes. lol<br /><br /><br />Each person can enter TWICE only, please. <br /><br />Make it up, paste it from online, whatever, makes no difference. But it has to be funny.<br /><br />18+ rule is obviously in effect, so dirty jokes are welcome too.<br />But nothing racist or prejudiced, please. <br /><br /><br /><br />At 23.59 GMT Sat 16th Feb, the competition ends, and person who posts the joke that made me laugh the most, gets the ฿0.20&nbsp; Simples. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, there you have it.<br />Posting this here so noobs can also play. <br />As I said, just a bit of SR community spirit fun. <br /><br /><br />Ready? Set? GO!&nbsp;

				An elderly man in Louisiana had owned a large farm for several years. <br /><br />He had a large pond in the back. It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some apple and peach trees.<br /><br />One evening, the old farmer decided to go down to the pond and look it over, as he hadn&#039;t been there for a while.<br /><br />He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit.<br /><br />As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. <br /><br />As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. <br /><br />He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end.<br /><br />One of the women shouted to him, &quot;We&#039;re not coming out until you leave!&quot; <br /><br />The old man frowned, &quot;I didn&#039;t come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.&quot;<br /><br />Holding the bucket up, he said, &quot;I&#039;m here to feed the alligator.&quot;

				Here is my joke&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Those dang 4 hour erections<br /><br /><br />What happens when you ask for help with an erection lasting more than 4<br />hours?<br />Jim Bob walked into a drug store in Kentucky and asked to talk to a male<br />pharmacist. The woman he was talking to said that she was the only<br />pharmacist and as she and her sister owned the store, there were no male<br />employees. She then asked if she could help him. Earl said that it was<br />something that he would be much more comfortable discussing with a male<br />pharmacist. The lady pharmacist assured him that she was completely<br />professional and whatever it was that he needed to discuss, he could be<br />confident that she would treat him with a high level of professionalism.<br />Jim Bob then agreed and began by saying, &#039;This is tough for me to<br />discuss, but I get erections every day that last more than four hours.<br />It causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment, and I was<br />wondering what you could give me for it.&#039;<br />The pharmacist said, &#039;Just a minute, I&#039;ll talk to my sister.&#039;<br />When she returned, she said,<br />&quot;We discussed it at length and this is the absolute best we can do.<br />1/3 ownership in the store, a company pickup truck, a king size bed and<br />$3,000 a month in living expenses.
