				Was looking at buying some MDPV from him but noticed he requires FE on all orders.&nbsp; I searched the forums for his user name but didn&#039;t find any posts about him.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to FE for anything, especially vendors I haven&#039;t dealt with before.&nbsp; I have an order in with chembros but its been in &#039;processing&#039; for 4 days and he hasn&#039;t responded or read any of my messages so I was looking for another source.

				No I did not hear back from ChemBros but my order was marked &#039;in transit&#039; the day after I posted this.&nbsp; No idea what&#039;s going on with it as it seems&nbsp; that ChemBros profile says they are sold out and in stealth mode.&nbsp; Read another post on here that said they are now using the vendor account 2hotchicks.<br /><br />Still waiting for my order, tomorrow will make it 10 days but I&#039;m not in the US so it could take a little longer. Did you ever hear back?

				You can get MDPV from sensearomatics.net. Better and cheaper than from this scammer.

				Hi,<br />I can just only tell you my experience with CMC from last week. Somehow I was bored at night looking at was had come in new in Germany for the past hours.&nbsp; And there was a listing by CMC that blew me away, and I ´ve seen some PR-Stunts on the road for over six months. She/He offered 0.2g of the Meth she is selling right now for FREE Tester. Okay, I guess, most lukely 55 Bucks shipping for for some &quot;close friends and buyers`&quot; But I wsa wrong : 0:00 Shipping!meaning she´s not even givíng ot for feer but she´s also paying for it.<br />What to loose, so I hit the button! Next day I even had to laugh at nyself for shortly believinh it and the product was already in transit. Nevertheless I was a little more down to earth.<br />I have never bought at cmc befotre! I have already tried 5 tirms Meth, (private), and one time from a german vendor here on SR, since I hate shippingober borders, especially the well known for certain drugs. Every time the money was enough I automatically at cmc or the even higher priced&quot;redbull&quot;, although I had good experiences with him for another producct. And so I always finally sticked with my well known coke, but very curious for Meth!Long Story short, after about 6 days later a completely stealth letter arrived including the promised Neth!!! <br />Again I´M not an expert, but I am sure to have felt that energetic, euphoric high for thr first time in my life! Sad to say, but I´m already hooked.The material looked just like in the pictured, just alittle mote crushed, which ii unevitable tha way post packages are pressed today. The high was great and I quoute CMC&quot;:A good Quality for a cheap price?&quot;<br />Tehe Meth was runnung very smooth on foil and had a wonderful sweet taste to it . Lasted somrverx long hits.<br />I think you have to take Sukex the way she is, sometimes faster, sometimes longer,but alwasy a surprise<br />Thanks a lot for being a man or a woman of your word and sending out that letter on your risk and money. <br />I will repost that letter in different forums conceirning you or METH!!! It comes all down to you and your coompetitor &quot;REDBULL&quot;, Coke is out so far.... Thanks<br />

				I am looking for some provider of real MDPV or APVP in europe. It&#039;s tempting to just try some, but any order is a risk. There is some much controverse feedback on the PV, with altering batches and anything. I do trust the bad reviews a bit more to be honest. But strange it is: some are really blown away, some say they blew away the package in one night. Just like the PV I ordered from another guy last week. Much too weak.. do the people know what they write? <br /><br />And the guy with is aromat. powder shops.. pouh..<br /><br />Any thoughts ?
