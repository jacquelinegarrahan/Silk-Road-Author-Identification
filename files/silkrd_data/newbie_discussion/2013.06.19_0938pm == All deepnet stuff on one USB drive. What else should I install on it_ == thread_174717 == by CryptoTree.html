				I have the tor browser bundle on a tiny 8gb USB drive. Damn its tiny! I couldn&#039;t believe it. It&#039;s small enough I could even swallow it like a large pill, hahaha. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious what else I should put on there. When need to reup on btc I&#039;ll probably put my wallet on there or something. Or maybe I&#039;ll just go purely online for my wallet. Thoughts?<br /><br />Anyway I was also thinking about installing Ubuntu on there, so that I could boot up from flash. Does this increase my security in any measurable way, or is that really just fluff. Thoughts?<br /><br />Also should I look at encrypting the flash drive so that one can&#039;t see what&#039;s on it without first supplying a password or something? I&#039;m just thinking as a last resort maybe it would keep the authorities from being able to get any useful information from it. <br /><br />

				Backup your wallet, or anything else you put on a USB that you don&#039;t want to lose. Flash memory can die in a split second, without warning. Just never forget that. <br /><br />You can also install a version of Linux on a flash drive. Boot to linux from the flash drive, do your dirty and withdraw.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I was thinking about doing with Ubuntu, but does that actually increase my security at all, or is it just an extra layer?<br /><br />I have plenty of room and now how, but if it doesn&#039;t help significantly then having to restart every time I want to go on deepweb would be a real hassle. Since Tor is self contained, I don&#039;t think it leaves anything behind on the computer you access the flash from, so it doesn&#039;t seem like it would be a real issue, yeah? Though getting the OS would increase flexibility on installing other programs.

				Hey Crypto<br /><br />I am not sure how much difference it really makes, but I went with this TAILS setup:<br /><br />http://lifehacker.com/5916551/browse-like-bond-use-any-computer-without-leaving-a-trace-with-tails<br /><br />Quite handy because it has all the PGP stuff built right in. All you need extra is a Tormail account and you are good to go. <br /><br />You can set up for persistent storage on USB so you can save PGP keys, bookmarks, emails etc. <br /><br />It even has an XP lookalike stealth mode for use in public places! It shuts down in about 2 seconds deleting absolutely all traces from memory caches etc., at least that is what they claim.<br /><br />Working well for me.<br />

				From what iv gathered running Ubuntu or tails from a usb/cd is great security plus its always fun to play with new software but i dont think its necessary for the average buyer... Sometimes it can be a pain booting tails/Ubuntu every time you just wonna search the forums/SR.... <br /><br />I would suggest encrypting that USB with TrueCrypt and also Encrypt your computers hard drive... This way even if your usb fell into the wrong hands its safe, And encrypting your computer HDD just adds extra peace of mind...

				Niiiiice. Tails seems like the way to go if I go full OS. Thanks! <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I need that much security yet or not, but I&#039;m considering it. Plus like you said it&#039;s fun to mess around with new software.
