				Hey guys,<br /><br />I have a question about how long I should wait before dosing again. A little past history:<br /><br />Used MDMA 4-5 times in the past 2 years, one of which was last night. <br /><br />I typically take 100-150mg (never more), and I&#039;ve always spaced doses at least a month apart, except for one occasion where I did it two days in a row, and the comedown the second night was very uncomfortable and jittery. The last time I did it before last night was over a year ago.<br /><br />Last night I probably took 150mg, which is fairly large for my weight. It was just a pinkie dip, so I&#039;m estimating 150mg based on the fact I had had some drinks earlier, the set and setting wasn&#039;t great, and it still felt like a moderate roll. Nothing crazy like previous experiences, but just pleasant. I feel like if I had been sober and in a better setting, it would have been very strong, as I could tell this was pretty pure. I didn&#039;t use 5-HTP (it was a spur of the moment kind of thing) though I did stay hydrated and had orange juice as I was coming down, and more this morning. I felt fine today, and I&#039;ve never gotten the &quot;tuesday blues&quot; from MDMA, though I have gotten it from methylone once or twice (I&#039;ve also used methylone about 6-7 times in the past year).<br /><br />Anyway, I feel dumb because I should have remembered that I&#039;m going to a concert a week from tomorrow where MDMA would definitely have been perfect, a much better experience than last night, and lots of other people will be doing it. But I know that 9 days in between isn&#039;t quite enough time for my serotonin levels to get back to normal. I only plan on rolling one more time in late June and that will probably be my goodbye to the drug, at least for a while.<br /><br />My question is: How safe is spacing doses out a week apart if I only do it once, haven&#039;t used it much in the past, and otherwise keep doses spread out? My primary concern is to not damage my brain, and a secondary concern is that I just won&#039;t roll very hard now (unless I take an unusually large amount).<br /><br />Is there anything I can do in the interim (vitamins, exercise, etc.) that will help my brain get back to normal more quickly? I live a healthy lifestyle, take vitamins, work out almost daily and don&#039;t eat a lot of crap food. I don&#039;t have any underlying health conditions or take any medications. I have been feeling a bit bummed out the past couple months, but it&#039;s a pretty uncertain and stressful time in my life so it may be due to that.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it to a) risk it and b) waste a roll if i won&#039;t even feel it. Can anyone shed some light on this? And if you don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea, don&#039;t encourage me and say &quot;seems like you want to, so go for it.&quot; I need honesty, as while I do want to, I know I made a dumb choice doing it last night and I may have to deal with the consequences and refrain for a while.<br /><br />------<br /><br />TL;DR: Healthy lifestyle, don&#039;t use MDMA often. Last night took a large dose for the first time in over a year, but didn&#039;t feel it due to alcohol &amp; other variables. Questioning rolling again next weekend and looking for advice on neurotoxicity and muted effects if I do.

				I would wait if you can. I get lingering positive fx for around 2 weeks and feel that 1 mth is a good turn around. U will probably still have a blast though.

				You sound a lot more knowledgeable about Molly than I do, but maybe my anecdotal evidence can help you decide one way or another.<br /><br />I&#039;m about 155lbs. During a music festival in Vegas last year (you can probably guess which one) my friends got me to roll for the first time and we did it for three straight days, averaging about 250mg each roll... while drinking copiously. I did not realize how bad an idea this was at the time, but it actually ended up being the best roll I&#039;ve ever had since. Even the comedown on the fourth day was mild, relative to all the subsequent (perhaps 3-5) times I&#039;ve rolled after that weekend.<br /><br />However, my most recent experience rolling was two times in three days (again averaging about 250mg each time) and although the first roll was pretty solid, the second sucked; I was anxious, the roll was mild and lasted only about two hours, and I felt down before we even left the club.<br /><br />My uneducated guess is that 10 days between rolls sounds like a lot but, to reiterate, my knowledge of Molly isn&#039;t very deep. Hope that helps even a little, happy rolling!

				honestly i&#039;ve done it many times before.&nbsp; I know its terrible for you but i was young once.&nbsp; If your doing good shit, you will roll.&nbsp; I rolled pretty hard every time.&nbsp; I am very healthy including working out daily, and pre and post loading vitamins.&nbsp; if you make a habit out of this, you will however feel awful effects. sometimes id briefly forget my train of thought mid sentence.&nbsp; I also experienced brain zaps from a few batches. I would never recommend this, it was not a great feeling to walk around with.&nbsp; Just keep it special, but you really wont be harming yourself to much by doing it occasionally.&nbsp; I know kids who roll every weekend, and love it.&nbsp; i have no idea how bad their brains must be suffering.&nbsp; everyone is different, find our where you stand.

				Alexander Shulgin (the guy who rediscovered MDMA) says 4 times a year.<br /><br />But you&#039;ll probably be fine.

				You&#039;re fine, just don&#039;t make a habit out of it. I&#039;ve been rolling weekly this past month because of all these amazing shows popping out of nowhere... I do however workout 5 times a week, take multivitamins, and watch what I eat.
