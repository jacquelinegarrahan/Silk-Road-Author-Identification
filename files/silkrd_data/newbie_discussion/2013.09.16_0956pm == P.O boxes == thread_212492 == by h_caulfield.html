				I have never had any problems dommestically (AUS)<br /><br />&nbsp; I have been wondering the same thing recently in regards to importing small quantities.<br /><br />I have no idea which is best, fake PO box or residential with an alias or something.<br /><br />And what the real world punishments for substances under 3.5gm.&nbsp; Surely LE wouldn&#039;t set up a sting or a CD for those amounts?<br />

				I have buddies accept mail often.&nbsp; I always put a business name, and their address.&nbsp; This way, if there was ever a controlled delivery, he could always refuse it and say he wasnt expecting anything.&nbsp; If its addressed to his actual name, then its a little bit harder to refuse.&nbsp; Put fake business name, and his address, when he gets it, if youre not immediately getting it from him, have him write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it, and leave it right at the door until you come to get it, or until he decides its safe to bring it to you.

				This should go without saying, but around the time that the package is supposed to arrive, there should be absolutely no illegal drugs of ANY kind at your receivers house.&nbsp; This way, if they want to be dicks and search his place, they will find nothing, and not be able to tie him to the package.&nbsp; If there are drugs at the receivers place, they will link the package to him, and well......he&#039;ll probably sing like a canary at that point and give all your information over unless he&#039;s a real professional who knows how to deal w situations like that.&nbsp; Always offer to pay your receiver&#039;s attorneys fees in the case of anything going sour, so that they ask for an attorney instead of chirping your sensitive details out to law enforcement like a bird.
