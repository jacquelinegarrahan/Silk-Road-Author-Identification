				Hello<br /><br />I have finally got round to plunging into the deep net &amp; registering on the mighty SR. Apologies if any content of this post is not appropriate but I&#039;m obviously a complete novice around here ...<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m looking to obtain some quality acid, which I find v difficult to get locally (and possible some coke).<br /><br />I have registered with a Bitcoin provider and am now looking to make a purchase. I&#039;m still a bit confused as to exactly how to go about setting up a purchase / using bitcoins.<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t really have an alternative address for delivery - is it safe to use your home address ?<br /><br />Any tips or recommended vendors ?<br /><br />Thanks

				I am indeed.<br /><br />However the more I look around on here, the more confusing it gets !<br /><br />Vendors talk about using PGP keys for communicating, but messaging them directly seems to be straightforward (and I thought pretty safe given where we are !).<br /><br />And how safe is it to discuss things on here&nbsp; !?<br /><br />I guess there is understandable degree of paranoia &amp; anonymity protection issues, but I kind of thought once you get onto the SR it was fairly safe ..

				Thanks<br /><br />SynthesisWizard &amp; Machine Maid seem promising for acid...<br /><br />Are the prices generally a bit higher on here than on the street ?<br /><br />Also, this site recommends the first step on to the SR is to use a VPN / proxy server (HMA etc.)<br /><br />http://silkroaddrugs.org/<br /><br />But I noticed on the SR site it seems to say just use Tor bundle ... more confusion ?

I would say though, stay with domestic vendors, you may pay a slight bit more but its a lot safer then order from Europe and trying to get through customs etc.<br /><br />For me, buying MD is cheaper on SR then buying locally, but for coke its a lot more, but the quality is a lot higher so I don&#039;t mind paying it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only used Tor so not too sure tbh :o<br /><br /><br />S
