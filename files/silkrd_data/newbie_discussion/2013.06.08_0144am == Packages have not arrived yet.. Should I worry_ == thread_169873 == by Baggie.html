				I am not worried as I expect that since they have not arrived today that they will be in tomorrow. However, if customs did happen to seize them then would they arrive just as fast as if they didn&#039;t? And if customs seizes my shit then should I worry about any possible legal action from LE? I understand that if in the worse case scenario (CD) I would just Deny any order and not sign for a damn thing but could legal action still be taken against me for products that I&#039;ve ordered (I know that there is no physical proof that I&#039;ve ordered anything).

				If your packages were seized, they won&#039;t arrive at all, unless you&#039;ve ordered large quantities of something and they attempt a Controlled Delivery. Most likely you would get a love letter saying that they found your contraband and that would be all.

				I&#039;ve always wondered, does having a shipment intercepted mean you should not try ordering to the same address again? I know people always talk about using different &quot;drop points&quot;, but how does this actually work exactly for most people?? Do you use your friends&#039; addresses sometimes? Or do you literally find places that are uninhabited and grab the mail from there? Say I live in a populated city. How would I go about finding alternate &quot;drop points&quot;?

				Alrighty haha, Yea I was pretty curious about that. I haven&#039;t ordered large quantities of anything and I know not to sign for shit! XD So I guess if I get a love letter then just ignore the fuck out of it? can the 5-0 show up to question me after recieving a love letter?

				They could question you, but it&#039;s unlikely that they would.&nbsp; If they did, you should just ask them politely whether or not you&#039;re under arrest, and when they say no (which they would, as they would have no grounds for arrest), politely tell them that you don&#039;t wish to answer any questions.&nbsp; You can repeat that as many times as necessary.<br /><br />So yes, ignore the letter.&nbsp; It will say something about how, if you want to contest the seizure, you can contact customs, or file paperwork or something (I imagine that some dumbass somewhere has probably tried to get his dope back from customs, but I doubt that anyone has been successful). Just treat the letter like you would treat it if you actually had no idea what it was about.&nbsp; Which you won&#039;t, since you would never be involved in drug distribution. :D

				People establish and use drop points in different ways.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of different opinions about this issue in the forums.&nbsp; Personally, if I got a love letter from Customs, I wouldn&#039;t receive an international package at that address again.&nbsp; But I probably wouldn&#039;t worry about domestic packages.<br /><br />Some people would never ship to their own address in the first place.&nbsp; I order everything online anyway, and I get packages practically every day, so I don&#039;t have a problem ordering SR stuff to my house.&nbsp; But domestic is much safer, so I rarely order internationally.<br /><br />I have used drop points occasionally.&nbsp; I live in a population dense area, and for me, the easiest drop points are neighbors.&nbsp; I have a couple of neighbors who work long hours, so every now and then, if I need to order to a drop address, I have my package sent to a neighbor and then liberate it from their mailbox before they get home from work.&nbsp; There&#039;s no room for mistakes with this method though.&nbsp; You have to know when your package is coming and be able to watch for it and collect it before the neighbor gets home.

				Ahhh nice hahaha So it&#039;s unlikely for all the orders I&#039;ve been waiting on (which are domestic mind you(:) to have been busted. I did order from Tomorrowman so there is a chance that Customs may seize that shipment I suppose.

				Kids, I get mail all the time. Police won&#039;t take your mail for no reason, mmkay? You only need one drop point. They only take your mail if you&#039;re doing something illegal, mmkay? Like if you get drugs in the mail, that&#039;s illegal, mmkay? Don&#039;t do drug. Drugs are bad, mmkay?

				LMFAO. There&#039;s always someone.<br /><br />In the US, these searches and seizures are definitely legal.&nbsp; But Baggie doesn&#039;t give a shit anyway, because unlike CanadianCook&#039;s apparent situation, any drugs that Customs seizes from packages addressed to Baggie, are not actually his. They probably belong to CanadianCook, who may be seeking to establish a test case for suing US Customs.
