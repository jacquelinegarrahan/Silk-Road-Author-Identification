				&nbsp;hello everyone.<br />me and my team are a new vendor on the silk road and we go by the name PrimeRoll. <br />we will be selling methylone, mdma, lsd, dmt, and eventually marijuana. (maybe just concentrates)<br />now we have everything we need to get started being a part of this amazing community except ONE thing.<br /><br />now ill be shipping priority mail flat rate ONLY but cant figure out a safe way to do so. ive done MORE than enough research, searched the <br />forums, and countless other things and ive only came up with 2 ways to pay for postage. either use a card and print a label off the internet (unless<br />someone has a way to get a prepaid card without information that wont work) or go to the post office and pay there. (obvious why i refuse to do that)<br />ill be shipping using the drop boxes and need a way to get everything set up from home and then take it to the drop box. <br /><br />all ideas are welcome!!!! thank you very much everyone!<br />

				The easiest way to ship would obviously be able to establish accounts online so that you never have to deal with other people in other businesses, e.g. the Post Office and be seen on Camera, but truthfully, I&#039;ll PM you online.&nbsp;
