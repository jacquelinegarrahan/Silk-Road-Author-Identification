				I am a skeptic. I cant believe their is a possibility that I could buy registered documents that can prove that I am a legal U.S citizen. <br /><br /><br />http://xfnwyig7olypdq5r.onion/index.php I found this on TORLINKS.<br /><br />This sounds to me like bullshit. Has anyone actually used this service? I was raised in the U.S as long as I can remember (younger than 1 years old). I fell through the cracks, and because I stood up for myself, I accumulated a criminal record. Making it a nightmare to apply for citizenship. <br /><br />Even though I have disagreements with this country. There is no place in the world where I would want to live. Applying for citizenship has a risk of me being stripped away from my child and family. Who are all American Citizens, some who are veterans since the Korean war. <br /><br />This fear of being stripped away from my child and immediate family is the reason why I do not pursue citizenship. Even though countless of lawyers say that I will be American. A lawyers word is good as shit in my opinion, thats one thing I learned from living here all my life atleast. <br /><br />Maybe I should tough it out. But if this is a real legit way to get my citizenship. I want to take it. Im sick of being held back when my friends go over seas. Im sick of being seeing as foreigner when my father enlisted in the U.S military. I am a American, but because of some paperwork I am a foreigner, and its been killing me since I was a child.<br /><br />Im not a terrorist. I just want to be able to be who I really am. I want it so bad that Im willing to risk it all for it. If anyone has any experience with this company, please let me know. <br />

				Why not just use a trusted Vendor on here to get the documents you need, just look under forgeries, Im not sure what that link is but I would not trust it myself
