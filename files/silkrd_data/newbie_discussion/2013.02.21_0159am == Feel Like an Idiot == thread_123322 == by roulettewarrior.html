I have lived in s fl for 20 years and the advertised prices arent&nbsp; even close. Even the prices based on&nbsp; &quot;recreation-type&quot; purity (60% - 70% pure)&nbsp; are twice as much atleast. I do, however, see some redeeming benefits.&nbsp; Security and anonymity and perhaps safety. But it does seem to come at a price along with some required patience.&nbsp; I suppose I&#039;ll hang out an see how it goes since the traditional&nbsp; &quot;phone-call&quot;&nbsp; approach isnt working for me these days

				as far as i know there aren&#039;t a lot of drugs where i live, or at least drugs that are actually being sold as what they are...<br /><br />the anonymity is definitely a draw, as is the &quot;amazon&quot; like setup of the market. i would much rather jump through some slightly inconvenient hoops for the road as opposed to meeting with people i don&#039;t fully trust with a pocket full of cash. :)

				I honestly like the complexity of it all. I&#039;m still pretty new at this, but learning and hopefully mastering the complexities if this site and the darknet just seems like proper initiation into a secret club. Also talking about bitcoin is also a great interesting discussion starter without giving away that you are into drugs.

				Without giving away... well, but hinting maybe. I still like to keep my mouth shut about bitcoins if I don&#039;t need to talk about it. Bad press is still bed press. Better to lay low in my opinion.

				no offense, but if any idiot with a computer would get his drugs from SR it would probably be shut down in no time. SR is slow as it is, imagine if everyone who ever heard of it would buy their drugs here. It wouldn&#039;t work

				Complexity is good, less buyers and the supply/demand ratio swings in the buyers favor!<br />Prices on SR are a half to a quarter of the street prices in my neck of the woods, and I don&#039;t often get to hear honest reviews prior to purchasing off the street!

				The level of intelligence required to access and use the site will lower over time due to people willing to educate the masses or make products that simplify access for money.&nbsp; This will inevitably lead to more mistakes made by people revealing their identities and such in clear, keeping us in the know and on the down low out of the spotlight for sure.&nbsp; I am suspecting that we will need to &quot;fan&quot; our vendor&#039;s so that once they go into stealth we can continue to purchase from them.&nbsp; They being forced to stealth mode by having enough business to make them happy with a customer base that they currently trust....
