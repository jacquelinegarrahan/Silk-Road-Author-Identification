				Hello SR, I have just come into contact with some T.Leary&#039;s Oaxaca Strain mushrooms. I have done research and I just want to run this by anyone experienced Psychonauts<br /><br /><br />My Cunning Plan!<br /><br />I will ingest 2 grams of these mushrooms now I will be doing a solo trip it is still light outside and I am expecting to trip for 8 hours (can anyone confirm if 2 grams will last 8 hours). I plan on playing soft music probably Harry Chapin and just lay in my bed and relax and enjoy the show I will also be recording myself. I plan to have my phone dialed to emergency just in case God forbid. This will truly be the first time I ever dive into a psychedelic so I am hoping to have a good time. I plan to have a bag ready incase I get nausus but I have eaten before hand so I will test that out.<br /><br /><br />Any other tips?<br />Am I taking to much?<br />How long should my high last?<br />What should I expect (visuals? the walls just melt away and I&#039;m on Pluto? ect.<br /><br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />-Lord Biron&nbsp;

				Hey man, I&#039;m sure anyone will agree with me when I say this, if this is your first trip then get a sitter. This is someone who can calm you down if you have a bad trip, make sure you&#039;re ok and also make sure you don&#039;t hurt yourself. This is a wise move, trust me.

				I won&#039;t be able to get a sitter sadly. I don&#039;t plan on having a bad trip I am very mentally strong not to toot my own horn or anything but I can&#039;t lay on the bed and play itunes and relax?

				For your first trip, I really do suggest you have someone watch after you. If anything, get lots of sleep beforehand, Eat a little beforehand, keep the vibes positive, turn off cellphones, and have fun! If you are having a bad trip, just remind yourself that it&#039;ll be over in a few hours. Oh and stay away from mirrors.

				Try a full dose of DMT or Ibogaine HCL sometime! I swear, you&#039;ll never fear any other psychedelic ever again!!! LOL&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />-Be informed before you consume anything and goodluck. Have a great trip and mirrors aren&#039;t so scary if you can handle your shit.

Do you immediately go stand in line for the biggest roller coaster ride or do you ride a bunch of smaller ones before ramping up to the biggest ride there? lol
