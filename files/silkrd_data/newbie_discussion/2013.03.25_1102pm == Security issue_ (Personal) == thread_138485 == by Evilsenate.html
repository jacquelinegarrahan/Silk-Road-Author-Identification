				So I had a quick question.. When I first came to SR I was a total noob when it come to making orders and stuff. I was a bit overwhelmed by the road at first.. Anyhow on my first order even though the item was legal I used my real address.. and I didn&#039;t use pgp.. Is there a way to remove it so that it is never seen again? Would I have to contact an admin or something? <br /><br />Also I doubt I would ever have an issue anyways as I haven&#039;t spent that much money for it to be worth the time of anyone.. But I still can be paranoid right? <br /><br />I was extremely stupid for doing it and very naive.. I regret it. Especially since I have been more paranoid then usual.. Any advice is welcome.. <br /><br />Thank you.

				I never PGP my address. I suggest people do if they want, but I order from multiple vendors simultaneously and its just too much of a pain in the ass. I&#039;m still a free man. If a vendor requires it, I don&#039;t use them. Chill, you&#039;re fine. <br /><br />Now, if you were buying a half K of blow, then, yea, PGP your shit, but for small orders and personal stuff, I never bother with it. (Some people will crucify me for saying this.) <br /><br /><br />Also, it&#039;s not bad to be paranoid in this environment. not bad at all.&nbsp;

				Yeah I didn&#039;t think being paranoid (at least a little bit) is a bad thing.. You&#039;re right. Especially in this environment. However your post did make me feel a little better.. thanks.

Or anything of the sort. And, most vendors copy and paste it, print it, then delete it. :)
