				Hey whats up hipsters!!! I just ordered some DMT from NewTime. This will be my first time doing DMT. Has anyone had any experience with this vendor and is there anything I need to know before blasting off into hyperspace? I&#039;m already familiar with magic shrooms and LSD. I just wanted to take that next step into my own consiousness&nbsp; :)

				Never personally dealt with him before, but as far a deemsters goes, I recommend being with the smallest amount of friends possible (some prefer being alone but i cant stand it tripping) <br />It can just be a vibe killa when people are talking/staring etc when you&#039;re trying to escape the realm... But then again I&#039;m sure your DMT will be much more potent than mine was so it won&#039;t matter nearly as much.<br />have fun yo

				Yea I plan on doing it alone because I hear having others around that are talking or messing with you can diminish the experience. NewTime&#039;s product is supposedly 95%-99% so hopefully I can breakthrough. Thanks for your input dude!!

				I&#039;ll post a review as soon as I recieve my product. Its been 2 weeks so far hopefully customs hasn&#039;t snatched it up with their filthy hands. I&#039;m just glad I&#039;m able to purchase something like DMT on The Silk Road I&#039;d never be able to find it where I live at. I&#039;ve never in my life heard of anyone mentioning DMT much less extracting it and selling it lol.

				Can&#039;t help with the seller.<br /><br />DMT is short acting but pretty intense though and if you like other psychedelics, I can strongly recommend, I just love the fact there is no noticeable come down.<br /><br />Have fun buddy.
