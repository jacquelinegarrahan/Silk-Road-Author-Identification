				Im up for anything! i havent had any coke off of SR yet, and the stuff i get in my town is bunk... ALWAYS! that&#039;d be something really cool to get a sample of. good h is always an awesome sample, seeing as how its also garbage in this town. im up for anything, and will definitely write the most in depth and honest review i can. dont expect a 5 star review if you dont have 5 star service! im an honest person. i always need bud, too! id love to review some of that. anything, guys! this reminds me... i owe collapses a review for my last btc purchase. <br />I ordered btc from collapses via moneygram. I messaged before placing the order and it turns out he had the coin. I only needed about 50 bucks worth. Paid nine bucks for the moneygram... haha yeah that was kinda lame, but BI was down and this person was nice enough to sell me some. I do believe his fee was 12%, but honestly, to me that&#039;s very reasonable seeing as how its anonymous and easy... and FAST. he was SO FAST. i had my coin in literally about an hour and a half. amazing communication throughout the entire thing. If you&#039;re in need of coin fast and easy, check out Collapses... you&#039;ll be happy you did! =)

				Wow, yet another junkie begging for free dope on the forums. Get a life kid<br /><br />by the way if you plan on reviewing product like you just reviewed at Bitcoin purchase then I wouldn&#039;t expect to be receiving anything in the mail anytime soon because your review was absolutely horrible and sounded like a 15 year old kid just trying to make someone happy to receive free drugs

				As you probably know, you need 50 posts to post in the product offers forum, but that is where you will find vendors wanting to do samples of product. You need to build a bit more of a reputation around here before anyone will want to send you free product.

				For real?&nbsp; Vendors actually send free samples to people who&#039;ve never purchased from them before? I find this hard to believe.

Then in return you give some feedback about the product, shipping speed, etc., and hopefully buy it as a paying customer in the future.

				Damn guys. Sorry that was so offensive. Im not begging at all and happen to make legit purchases on SR. Blk9955 is my account and ive been buying for around 3 months. Original account was blk99 but i.forgot the pin, therefore it has no buyer stats. Of course everyone is here to judge, though, right? Did my review get the point across? Sure did. I do agree it was written like a letter to fuckin santa clause tho lol re-fuckin-lax pr lay off the coke pr something. Christ. Everyones a critic.

				Oh, and i do have a job. Drugs to me are a way to explore the mind and innerself. More of a hobby than a lifestyle. And yeah i just got a free sample of dmt. Will be my first time. Im quite excited. Never judge a book by its cover, people. Did we not learn that in kindergarten? Why pay for things, especially things ive never tried, when i can get them for free... or a small amount of time, rather. Is this writing style good enough for you? Didnt know SR had a college level creative writing requirement, but i&#039;ll use mine from now on. Trolls. =)

You can bet that most vendors that see this will refuse to hook you up with a sample.

				Lol nah i have anxiety like a mofo. I didnt mean why have to pay in a freeloading sense. More of a &quot;ill do your drugs because i like doing them and will give an honest review&quot; for any upcoming vendors. They help me, i help them. I suppose i should associate with the forums more to gain credibility, though. That probably wouldve been a good idea before acting high and mighty like my word means a shit <br />

				So man you really think someones going to send you free drugs? like you really think that will happen? <br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and get it out of your head that you can get things for free in life, that&#039;s not how it works. you want drugs? work a little more, get a extra job so you get extra money to pay for drugs, no one&#039;s going to send you free drugs, especially if you beg/ask for them.<br /><br />Well yeah, maybe you could get a little sample, like 0.1g of something, but that&#039;s if your really trusted, in SR and the forums, even if your account had good buyers stats like you said, but there&#039;s no proof. <br /><br />Plus why would a new seller decide to use you, instead of a poster on the forums with 2000posts and amazing buyer stats.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Please get it out of your head that you can just get free stuff, and pay for your drugs like the rest of people. it&#039;s not like your special and deserve free drugs.<br /><br />Good luck, and go wash your neighbors car or something and maybe your mum will give you a little pocket money.&nbsp;

Most people here are over 18, and don&#039;t use internet slang like that, and talk about adult things that you won&#039;t understand.<br /><br />No one&#039;s &#039;trolling&#039; you here, there just being honest.&nbsp; <br /><br />And atleast wait until your 18 before buying hard drugs. if you really want to get high and worry your mother because your not a consenting adult with a full working brain and can harm yourself, just smoke the good herbal weed. <br />But there was a study that if your under 16, and smoke weed it can stall brain growth and lower your IQ by a maximum of 11 points. it was also confirmed, google it.
