				Ok, so here is the deal. I ordered some blotter internationally. The package arrived safely at my door, however, another resident refused to sign for it, and it is now marked as return to sender. This happened recently.<br /><br />Here is my question. Given that the package is not something easily recognizable and that I paid $200 for it, how bad of an idea is it to go to the Post Office tomorrow morning and ask for it?<br /><br />I have no other evidence in my house or on my computer. If the police searched everything up and down, they would find nothing. The most they could find was maybe some tor traffic my ISP reports to them.

				Honestly? If the average person opened a random letter, and saw a few blotters of acid, they would have no idea what it was. I say go get your package.

				it will probably be ok. but if it were me, i err on the side of caution, since no amount of money spent is worth doing the time.... So I personally would not go.
