				Hi. Me and my friends have decided to get some LSD. Previously we&#039;ve only smoked weed and hash and sniffed some amphetamine. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how much should I take to actually have a deep experience. For now we think of taking about 200ug each. Is that enough for a good trip?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

It&#039;s better for every trip to be more intense than the last until you reach a comfortable level than for you to jump in over your head.

				Yep. I&#039;ll do 150 the first time. Then we&#039;ll see what happens. Maybe up the dose to 200-250 the second time.<br /><br />I was also thinking of taking a smaller dose (50-100) for walking outside in the park.

				My first time I took 1.5. Wasn&#039;t enough to hallucinate but I still felt vibrant and had some pretty good visuals. Wouldn&#039;t take more than 2 on the first time. LSD is the bee&#039;s knees.

				For walking in the park, you can go for 100ug (no point in starting with 50ug for something that light honestly). <br /><br />You can also dose another 50ug if you&#039;re feeling good and not too overwhelmed in 1.5-2 hours.

				I would say it takes about 200ug to get the full effect, but for the first time you might not want the full effect.

				So last week I had a chance to get my hands on LSD. I wrote a small trip report. Sorry for grammar errors ;)<br /><br /><br />Disappointment?<br /><br />When I first found out about LSD, I realized that this is the drug that is a must try. I’ve read a ton of forum threads and trip reports in the hope of a better understanding of the drug and its effects on the body. Reflecting on the upcoming trip under the influence of cannabis, I could almost imagine this state (at least I thought so). &quot;It&#039;s indescribable,&quot; &quot;You must feel it to be able to understand it&quot; virtually every report contains these words in one form or another; Yes - indescribable, yes - you must feel it ... BUT - that&#039;s not what I wanted and what I expected.&#039;<br /><br />I’ll Start from the beginning.<br /><br />Three Idiots - Me and two of my friends, decided to experience this feeling that &quot;is impossible to describe and has to be felt&quot;. We planned the set and settings trying to predict the potential causes of bad trips, tried to eliminate them. We hoped that our excessive use of cannabis could help us cope with paranoia. We decided to stay at my house. Thought through where we would sit down and do it. Pondered what we eat before and during .... All the planning was in vain, as the blotters got to us in the middle of the week. We couldn’t trip at my house in the middle of the week. It was logical to assume - postpone the trip for a couple of days and take the acid in a comfortable and familiar environment... But the the three drug zombies could no longer wait. It was decided to take the acid in the apartment of one of my friends, at night, in the middle of the week. The apartment was one big trap for bad trips. Unusual settings, &quot;vigilant&quot; neighbors do not allow to talk louder then whisper, the slightest disturbance - a knock on the wall, no result - call the police. I didn’t even want to smoke weed in that house. But our impatience has left us no choice, so in the evening, after work, we met at his place. <br /><br />We had 13 blotters of 150 micrograms. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We established a list of rules that mustn’t be broken whatever would happen..<br /><br /><br />1.<br />&quot;Respect the LSD&quot; many articles of serious psychonauts say<br /><br />We decided not to overestimate our abilities and take one blotter each, and Ivan the lightest of us (110 lb) took a third. Regardless of the outcome - do not take any more, and the remaining 10 blotters&nbsp; had to be stored for some other time.<br /><br />2.<br />Whatever happens - do not leave the house.<br /><br />3. <br />Nobody uses the phone and nobody opens the door. We turned off our cell phones and logged out of skype on the computer. <br /><br />4. No shouting out the windows.<br /><br /><br />5. Do not mix with other drugs.<br /><br /><br />A simple set of rules, not difficult to remember... but, in the next few hours, we managed to break all of the rules.<br /><br />We decided to start with some pot, and when it would let go - eat the blotters. In about 10 minutes our patience ran out and we ate the blotters. <br />While under the influence of weed we ate all the &quot;light&quot; food that was reserved for the trip. Within the next hour we were listening to our feelings, trying to distinguish the effect of marijuana from the start of the LSD. I could not understand if there was any effect at all. I began to suspect that we got some weak LSD, or maybe even a fake. After two hours of waiting we came to the conclusion that the weed had already no effect and what we felt was the LSD, which, in truth, at first very much felt like cannabis. Our impressionable lightweight friend ate the rest of his blotter. After nearly three hours nothing significant was happening, I could get a bigger effect with cannabis alone. We decided to take one more hit (I understand now that the tolerance had already built up and we had to take two). Our lightweight hesitated for some time, but no one forced him. In retrospect I realize that he had already started to feel paranoid :) I was disappointed. How so? Where is that feeling? Where are the visuals? Except some periodic bursts of laughter the LSD had no effect. Yes, I felt strange, but nothing extraordinary. Ivan started talking nonsense, he was always seeing something, and all that he had seen I could easily explain with real world phenomena. For example<br /><br />- wooooooow, everything suddenly became so bright!<br />- It&#039;s just the sun came out from behind the clouds.<br /><br /><br /><br />- wooooow, the shadows are suddenly soooo soft!<br />- The sun went behind the clouds.<br /><br /><br />So needless to say - an overly impressionable young man. The second comrade Leon, didn’t notice anything special. <br /><br /><br />An hour later, I took two more blotters. I was annoyed. This whole situation was stupid. The LSD has no effect, that fool is still talking nonsense, we sit on the balcony because of the neighbours we can’t sit inside. After another half an hour, I realized that the situation itself is not annoying, the main stimulus was HIM! He did not give me peace. Constant exclamations like &quot;we are all and everything.&quot; It was impossible to get rid of him. He clung to us like a small duckling to his mother. I suggested to separate to different rooms. I just could not stand him, but couldn’t say it to him. Only now I realize that it was the influence of the drug. Of course, he could not stay alone in the room, well, he just couldn’t, so I left Leon with him, and went to the other room. Finally I began to see distorted patterns on the walls. I noticed as the glass crystals on the chandelier turned into blobs of water and began to sag under their own weight. The leaves on the big flower began fading and coming to life again. There was still hope for an interesting trip. Meanwhile, from the balcony came the exclamations, which gradually ceased to carry any sense at all. It was time to look in the mirror, it was interesting to see my face. I thought that it had to change, but to my surprise - I saw nothing strange. Looking closer, I realized that my face was a little distorted like the patterns on the walls. It changed from an almost demonic and aggressive to being kind and naive. After playing with the reflection I switched to the pattern on the tile in the bathroom. It also breathed, turning from the a usual pattern to a beautiful medieval crest. The kitchen turned into a magical place. Without even turning the lights on I sat in front of the curtains and began examining the animated patterns. They were breathing even more actively and looked like the gills of a large fish. Several times it seemed that I could not see anymore, but the darkness gradually dissolved and turned back to the patterns on the curtains. I decided to go back to the balcony and offer the guys to go out and look at the city at night. Leon immediately agreed and said that we could walk to the nearest high-rise building and climb to the 25th floor &quot;great view from there.&quot; For some reason I agreed, but Ivan on the other hand started to get really paranoid. He did not want to go out, he did not want to be left alone, he was too scared. Leon suggested that he was now as a small child and we had to take care of him and take him outside. For half an hour we tried to dress him. He could not get his jacket on. He just couldn’t understand that his hands had to go into the sleeves. Tying his shoelaces proved to be an impossible task. Leon was helping him get dressed, and I noticed that he would be a great father some day, unlike me, I just could not tolerate his behavior. &quot;Can’t put your shoes on - stay home.&quot; Finally we got out of the apartment. When Leon said, &quot;get down while I close the door,&quot; I realized that he was under the influence too. &quot;Why go down when there is an elevator?&quot; Taking two oranges with us we got out into the yard.<br />On the way to the high-rise, it became clear that I was not entirely in control of myself as well. Here is the pathway, everything is clear, but still I walked on the lawn. The asphalt became a some kind of a swamp and I had to force myself not to look at it otherwise my pace became strange. We went to the street and the noise of the cars, fortunately, drowned Ivan’s exclamations. On the way we met a crowd Cops! about 10-15 people. I have not seen so many cops in my life. Pretending that everything was in order, and by some miracle making Ivan to shut up, we walked past them without incident. When we got to the high-rise, ​a brilliant decision was made - climb to the 25th floor on foot. Leon led the way, followed by Ivan, and me in the back not giving him a chance to run away. There was of course no light in the stairway, so we had to turn our phones on and use the flashes. I was amused by the fact that in order to use the flashlight I had to wait for the phone to boot up. &quot;Wait, I have to boot up my flashlight.&quot; The ascend to the 10th floor was smooth, the rest was more difficult. The graffiti on the walls was getting more weird. Some of the floors were burned by fire, making them look sinister. Ivan forgot that we were &quot;anything and everything&quot; and started a new routine &quot;Maybe we don’t have to jump?&quot;. I began to doubt the correctness of our decision to go up to the balcony. After the 14th floor the time slowed down and we began to move at a snail&#039;s pace. I was sweating, tired and even felt a bit scared. I was afraid that a certain someone would jump off. Looking at the city from the height on the building even Leon understood that we “are all and everything”, however he maintained control and even tried to clearly explain what he saw. Ivan calmed down a bit, but still sometimes suggested that we shouldn’t jump. I decided to peel the orange. My hand was wet, but not from the orange. Was it sweat? From time to time an elevator door opened behind us and I had what I called&nbsp; &quot;psychotic moments.&quot; I froze in place until the threat passed. I suggested we go down, in response Leon offered to smoke a cigarette. 20 cigarettes later we began the descent. This time we got in the elevator. The walk home went without incident, except for Ivan’s attempts to sit in the middle of the sidewalk. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home Leon decided to call his girlfriend, in the meantime I went to the balcony to watch the tree branches. They turned to spiders, ants, and even lots of little hands. L said that Ivan had to call his girlfriend too. He had no money on his cell phone and typing the password in Skype was just impossible. I protested, calling the girl was dangerous, you never know what could come in his head. But after half an hour of attempts to enter the password and attempts explain to her that&nbsp; &quot;we anything and everything&quot; Ivan said that he appointed a meeting with her at the train station and that he had to go. The problem was that she was in the US at that time and we were in europe. We dissuaded him go and we sat down to wait until the LSD lost control. It had to be no more than two hours and we were exhausted. Ivan could not sit in place. He was constantly trying to go somewhere. He did not even realize through what door we entered the apartment, the entrance or balcony. In the kitchen he took a knife and held the blade to his neck. It was &quot;fun&quot;. At 4 in the morning I gave up and decided go home.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got out of the taxi early and went home through the park. It was beautiful. At home I could not sleep, but laying in the bed, I realized what I had lost in terms of feelings. In a quiet environment I was able to enjoy the remains of visuals and thoughts. At six in the morning, fell&nbsp; asleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what conclusions did I come after taking LSD? <br /><br />1. I must take LSD alone, or at least without Ivan<br />2. I want DMT ;)<br />

				If this is the first time using a psychedelic substance i would recommend a medium dose (maybe 150). The reason is you don&#039;t want a too intense first trip which seems endless and you may get delusional or freak out. BUT for the first time i believe the effects are always a bit weakened. The first time i took LSD (my first time taking any drug) i took 90 mics and i didn&#039;t even slightly trip. I was just very high.<br />p.s the acid was legit as i used the rest of it the week after and was trippin balls.

				LSD safe as fuck, ever taken a whole ten strip befor? lol first time i ever did I got it from dealer man knowing he was legit, popped two tabs in mouth and had an awesome time. I didnt analyze the situation any further than that. Lol if your ever wondering start out with 1 tab, you can always do more later. I wanna take a 20 strip sometime ;p

In my personal experience taking more tabs an hour after the first tab does not add much to the trip. Better to wait for the next trip in my opinion.

				I havnt definitely taken 2 tabs of some low grade stuff and then about 3 hours in or so decided to take another 3 and I could definitely feel a good shift in intensity from this. I know the whole tolerance thing but I am talking about guaging the strength of your dose. If your not tripping as hard as you want to within couple hours I am sure taking more LSD is going to make you trip harder? lol

				For first timers I recommend the following:<br />The If you have two tabs, take one at first<br />Make sure you&#039;re in a relatively chill and comfortable place with people you know<br />If you normally smoke weed, you can toke to chill out your prefry anxieties, if not i don&#039;t recommend it until you get a feel for your trip<br />If you&#039;re liking where your trip is going about 90 minutes after dropping your tab, drop the second if you&#039;re feelin it. If not wait another hour or so<br />If you take your tab more than like 2-3 hours after your first tab, it might not make you fry harder, but rather just longer.<br /><br />In regards to avoiding a bad trip:<br />Try to keep yourself actively engaged in conversation with friends<br />If you start going into a dark thought path, try focusing on something happy, listen to happy music you&#039;re familiar with, or if it&#039;s a nice day look around and focus on your visuals<br />If your trip starts getting intense, embrace it DO NOT FIGHT IT. Resisting a trip never turns out well.
