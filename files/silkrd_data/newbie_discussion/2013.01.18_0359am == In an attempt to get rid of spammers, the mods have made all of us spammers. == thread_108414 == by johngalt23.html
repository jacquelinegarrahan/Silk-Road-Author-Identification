				It seems to be working so well against the spammers, since now it will just be constant on here, it irritates me, they can not make exceptions by asking a mod, I only get one when I want to give away extra coin or to leave feedback, both of wjhich I cant do now

You&#039;d think that once vendor status is conferred they&#039;d be out of purgatory, but doesn&#039;t seem to be the case. The rest of us just have to keep each other entertained or spam til we get out of here. The review threads cropping up atm aren&#039;t a bad idea, but it would probably be good if people c+p them into the proper threads once they&#039;re out.
