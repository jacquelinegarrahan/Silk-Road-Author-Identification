				Hi Gav,<br /><br />This is vlad1m1r, how are you? :-)<br /><br />Anyway, as you say I don&#039;t trade in Bitcoins any more due to the fact the filth came and seized my laptop on an unrelated manner and took most of the Bitcoins I was using with them. Still onwards and upwards.<br /><br />These days when I do need Bitcoins myself I buy them through LocalBitcoin dot com. If you&#039;re still at a loose end, send me a message and I&#039;ll give you some tipson how to get hold of Bitcoins anonymously via MtGox (it is possible but rather difficult).<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=125204.msg858535#msg858535">Quote from: gavinhalo123 on February 25, 2013, 03:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know that this question has been asked 1000x but I can&#039;t find a clear answer anywhere (people keep pointing at vlad1m1r but i&#039;ve heard that he is no longer on SR)<br /><br />I want to buy bitcoins, preferably cash, but I want to be sure it is anonymously.

Perhaps you were trying to get a rise out of me?<br /><br />I suppose there&#039;s no harm in mentioning it now. An ex of mine felt I was &quot;harassing&quot; her over Twitter. The swines seized my computer for evidence but were flummoxed by the password (thank you Truecrypt). I have been in a legal wrangle with them ever since as I have nearly 400 Bitcoins left in a wallet on there - will buy you a fruit basket when I get it back though... :)<br /><br />V.

				Try going to any big store like walmart or walgreens, and ask for a greendot moneypak, pay with cash then go to a vendor named Sugar Mama, he takes a percentage of you money and transfers bitcoins to your account, very reliable, I&#039;ve used him many times now

				Bitcoins are pefectly legal. Go ahead and buy them via your bank account. <br /><br />IF you&#039;re paranoid you might not want to load them directly into your SR account. If you wash them through easywallet.org they are close to untracable.

In all honesty, your only defence if caught could be to please ignorance and say that anyone can send anybody else unsolicited drugs in the mail - if the pigs can prove you bought Bitcoins shortly before the package arrived though...<br /><br />Easywallet can store coins but it doesn&#039;t operate a mixing service as far as I&#039;m aware. (Would any savvier users correct me on this if I&#039;m wrong?) The darling when I was trading was Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) - has this fallen out of favour?<br /><br />V. <br /><br />

How&#039;s that working out for you? :-D<br /><br />V.<br /><br />*If you recall I was successfully able to swindle another £350 of BTC out of a butthurt user by posing very publicly as someone with information concerning my own whereabouts (most Freudian I know!) This had the added benefit of making sure anyone else offering information on my whereabouts being automatically disbelieved... and you all thought you were so clever when you worked out we were the same person! It was adorable, really. :-)<br /><br />
