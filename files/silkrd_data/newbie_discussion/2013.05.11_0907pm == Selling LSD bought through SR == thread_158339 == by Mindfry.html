				I&#039;m just trying to break my 50 noob posts requirement. I live in a area that LSD is no where. There is plenty of people selling NBOME claiming its real acid but anyone who is experienced knows that its fake. So i believe I would have a fairly easy time selling quality acid at top dollar. I went with a 100tabs from JOR at 580$ to test it out. I really only plan on selling at a minimum of a 10 strip/ half sheets/ and full sheets. What pricing would you guys go with? <br /><br />Disclaimer: This is only a hobby (thats why i dont plan on selling anything less than 10), just to help pay for some bills while I am working full time and going to class. I am also considering buying some MDMA off the road since it has such good profit margins. Anyways just looking to break my 50 posts while not spamming, so I can post in the big boy forums.

				Sell 10 strips for 80 USD.&nbsp; Sell 5&#039;s for 45.<br /><br />LSD is a drug that opens minds and introduces people to their souls.&nbsp; In my opinion it isn&#039;t a drug to make a ton of money off.

				I would sell 10 strips for $80 to friends and for 90-100 for people you don&#039;t really know as well. LSD is a beautiful thing.

				my take on the whole selling LSD issues is this: <br /><br />If you have got actual LSD in a place flooded with NBOMEs sold as LSD, you are already doing your community some good. Sell for as high as you want. $100 for 10 sounds just fine to me, especially if you need just 1-2 for a good trip

				Could be a good idea if your area is scarce to that drug.<br /><br />Would love to get some LSD on The Philippines too. Can&#039;t wait til my PIN gets changed.
