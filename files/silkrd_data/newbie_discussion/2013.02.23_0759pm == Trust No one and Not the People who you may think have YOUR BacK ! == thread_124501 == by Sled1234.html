				Are you fucking serious?&nbsp; You are spamming this bullshit and yet the entire problem arose when you CHOSE to go outside of the escrow system to finalize early for a vendor that other people were having problems with.<br /><br />The vendor feedback score is based on feedback from buyers - it is NOT assigned by SR itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why were funds let go?&nbsp; BECAUSE YOU CHOSE TO FINALIZE EARLY.&nbsp; That&#039;s what FINALIZING EARLY means -- it means you are choosing to leave the escrow system and pay a vendor before you receive anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />We warn against this EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />Get a grip - you lost money, and that sucks, yes, but it&#039;s not SR&#039;s fault.&nbsp; The escrow system is in place FOR A REASON -- TO PROTECT BUYERS.

				also... vendors can boost their rating w/ bogus buyer accounts. You should always thoroughly investigate a vendor by looking at what types of transactions have boosted their rating levels. The forums are also a fantastic resource to get reviews on potential vendors.
