				I&#039;ll cut to the chase......... i&#039;m currently taking a whole bunch of medication for my mental illness which includes:<br /><br />Citalopram (anti-depressant) : 40mg a day<br /><br />Abilify/Aripiprazole(anti-psychotic): 30mg a day<br /><br />Procyclidine(anti-side effect): 15mg a day<br /><br />I&#039;m am really concerned about a lot of information i have read regarding serotonin syndrome,<br />I am looking to purchase MDMA, cocaine and methadrone from SR. How likely is SS to occur when taking these drugs combined with prescription drugs like SSRI&#039;s? i have heard it is pretty rare.<br /><br />Is this a really stupid thing to do (i know it probably is but i thought if i only take a&nbsp; small amounts of those drugs by themselves i&#039;ll be ok)<br /><br />Can someone please clarify the dangers associated with taking these specified drugs along with this medication, particularly SSRI medication?<br /><br />Any help is much appreciated <br /><br />Thanks. Peace.

				VERY likely, don&#039;t mix SSRI&#039;s with MDx&#039;s. As far as the coke goes I dno, google that shit. Seriously tho, do some research before you do some brain damage or kill yourself.

You DO know how to use Google dont you?<br />Second I ma on 16 meds and I know what I can take and what not to feel better, I just stick to pain meds and benzos BUT I did MY research.<br />PLEASE dont kill your self over all this, it just isnt worth it

				When are people going to figure out that taking drugs to make you &quot;feel&quot; better doesn&#039;t work, in fact it makes your depression worse when you come down. Then you become a drug addict which just compounds your problems and the shit just keeps piling on until your in jail, in a rehab, on the street or dead.&nbsp; Work on yourself and don&#039;t mix.<br />If your feeling down get up and go to the gym. Sweat a bit and perv on the sexy bodies. That always make me feel better.

				Have you tried nootropics?&nbsp; Ones like phenibut or l-tyrosine are fine when mixed with ssri&#039;s.&nbsp; Not 5-htp though.&nbsp; I take em and they make me feel great.&nbsp; Enhanced in a way.&nbsp; However the best thing that helps me mentally is regular exercise.&nbsp; Things like MDMA and cocaine are just gonna kill your happiness.&nbsp; Trust me.

				OK guys thanks for the advice.....i have taken it all on board. Seriously didn&#039;t know it was that dangerous to mix those kinda drugs with SSRI&#039;s. I am staying well clear until I&#039;m off the SSRI&#039;s, which is what i plan to do as i have not felt depressed for about 3 months now, so i am going to ween myself off SSRI&#039;s (of course first checking with my doctor and doing it slowly and carefully!!)<br /><br />Does anyone know if it is dangerous or just unwise to mix drugs like cocaine/MDMA with prescription medication like; anti-psychotics? And yes&nbsp; justabpgal i know how to use Google and i have done a lot of research as it is but i was just asking for additional &quot;first hand&quot; advice from actual drug users.<br /><br />Thanks peepes, any more advice/knowledge is welcome

				Slightly offtopic -- I was on 40mg Citalopram for a while as well, but I couldn&#039;t get a boner to save my life... even on 20mg cialis stacked with 100mg of Viagra. It was a nightmare. Dropped it down to 10mg and my sex drive came back lol. Any sex drive issues for you with the Citalopram? I find that the 10mg keeps me calm enough, allows me to have a sex drive and also boosts my lasting power hahaha.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad I checked this thread out as well... I was going to pop some molly for the first time -- I might not do that now.

				Methadone and other opiates are fine with SSRIs, I&#039;d be more worried about CNS depression if you combine it with antipsychotics, especially with methadone but it&#039;s not that high of a risk. You can always buy some cyproheptadine, an OTC allergy med that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome just in case.<br /><br />MDMA&#039;s effects are lessened by SSRIs anyways so I wouldn&#039;t take it, and cocaine could cause serotonin syndrome so have some cyproheptadine in handy just in case, but it shouldn&#039;t last so long if you did get it since cocaine is rather short acting. Antipsychotics don&#039;t mix well with stimulants though, they basically work in the opposite way so it&#039;s good to come down but I&#039;d prefer a benzo or even some unisom for that. Serotonine syndrome isn&#039;t that common though, I&#039;ve used stimulants when I was on them and it wasn&#039;t different from using them while off. Just don&#039;t take MDMA and hallucinogens, it doesn&#039;t work on SSRIs.<br /><br />SuperBeanFart I know what you mean :P I&#039;ve had other weirder sexual side effects from SSRIs, Prozac was the only one that didn&#039;t affect that much, but antidepressants suck anyways.

They are all a real bitch to dial in, especially with the bulk of them having a relatively long half life. If you can&#039;t get a boner now, it&#039;d gonna be a couple weeks before you have a chance in hell hahaha man does that suck. Try explaining that to a girlfriend you&#039;ve been with for 2 months :|<br /><br />Not to get all weird, but a bit of the sexual side effects helps me out -- I feel like I get myself too worked up sometimes and it&#039;s truly embarrassing when you can&#039;t hold out as long as you &quot;should&quot; be able to.

				SuperBeanFart yes my sex drive has lowered considerably since being on citalopram! god damn it!! lol it&#039;s one of the reasons i want to get off it........i only get horny when Ive hade p some mephedrone. ;) then i can go for ages lol<br /><br />Back to the subject guys after much research on Google the outcome is that it is not that dangerous to take MDMA with SSRI&#039;s....you would have to take a huge amount of it to kill you, however it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that people do NOT mix antidepressants (especially MOI&#039;s) with MDMA,it can (in extreme cases) kill you and at least make you feel very ill (even with small doses of MDMA). My plan now is to ween&nbsp; myself off SSRI&#039;s and then take MDMA after a couple of months of being off it. Same goes for anti-psychotics as well IF the doctor gives the all clear to get off them--- Ive not suffered any psychotic symptoms now for well over a year. <br /><br />Tree i think your confusing methadone with mephadrone(MCAT,4MMC) lol

I should&#039;ve known, methadone doesn&#039;t really fit in with cocaine and MDMA.

				Seratonin Syndrome happens when you take MD* substances with an MAOI(Monoamine oxidase inhibitor) antidepressant.&nbsp; An SSRI will limit the effects of rolling as tree stated.&nbsp; MAOI&#039;s aren&#039;t usually used to treat depression anymore.&nbsp; I think that MAOI&#039;s is a more commonly used to treat HIV patients now.

It also depends if it inhibits MAO-A or MAO-B, an MAO-B like deprenyl is actually recommended to take while rolling as it protects you from its neurotoxicity.<br /><br />SSRIs can also cause serotonin syndrome though, SSRIs combined DXM has a high chance of causing it for example.
