				I ordered some BTC through bitinstant, **copying and pasting the bitcoin address on &quot;account&quot; on SR** and waited and waited for my funds, never came. 12 hours afterwards, I send SR support a message asking for help, including the again copy&amp;pasted bitcoin address and guess what?<br /><br />According to the support at SR, they don&#039;t own that bitcoin address... So they&#039;re telling me I have to be wrong, that can&#039;t be the address it says on my account. I&#039;m now out $120 that i&#039;ve saved 3 weeks for to make some purchases. <br /><br />Do you guys think there&#039;s any way at all possible for me to prove to them that&#039;s what it says and get some kind of compensation? I&#039;m pretty bummed about this...<br /><br />edit: Just tried to &quot;withdraw&quot; from that account (the BTC aren&#039;t there anymore even on Blockchain) and using the pin I created with my account, it simply tells me &quot;insufficient funds&quot; whereas if i enter the wrong pin, it tells me it&#039;s the incorrect pin and I have 5 attempts remaining.<br /><br />How the fuck could this possibly be that I have the PIN to the account and it be the correct one if SR doesn&#039;t own that account?<br /><br />And to be clear: Blockchain reflected an appropriate amount in the account before it was drawn back out of it, but my SR account has never reflected. Something is very wrong here, I just want my money somehow.

				I find it is better to send to a personal address first, then send to the SR address. That way you know for sure that the purchase of BTC actually worked, and can then send it on to SR, separating the two potential failure points. Assuming of course that you do not mess up your address when ordering. <br /><br />As for compensation, I have no idea. Sucks to be out that much money, I know that for myself at this point a loss like that is a bank breaker.

				Maple<br /><br />That process will be done in the future and probably not with bitinstant either. There&#039;s no way I copied it wrong, it&#039;s the exact one that on Blockchain received and appropriate amount of BTC for my purchase.<br />But the problem is that SR gave me bitcoin address that they don&#039;t own. That&#039;s their goof, shouldn&#039;t they fix that?

				Sorry to hear you lost your coins. I am thinking that you must&#039;ve made a mistake somewhere along the line. I know that might be hard to admit, but I&#039;ve never had the problem you described after many transfers.<br /><br />I always get a new Bitcoin address on SR right before I transfer funds there. Then I don&#039;t change it again until after the coins have arrived. You might try this. If you are waiting for funds and your SR Bitcoin address is still the one you sent it to, SR can&#039;t claim that it&#039;s not a SR address.

				Have you verified that bitinstant actually sent the coins to the address you gave them?&nbsp; Check the address on blockchain.info and see if bitinstant has sent the coins.&nbsp; I had an issue with bitinstant myself a couple of weeks ago and it turns out they have slipped a bit in their customer service since the last time I did business with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />TinyDot

				Nomad - How should I go about posting a screencap&#039;d pic from SR? PM me if you need to (sorry, still new to Tor) <br /><br />Biteme- I would have thought the same thing, but on Blockchain it says it received an approriate amount of BTC, then it was taken out of the account later last night (but it NEVER showed on my SR account). I even re-coppied the address into the &quot;withdraw&quot; tab under it on the SR &quot;account&quot; screen. With the PIN I created, it simply tells me there&#039;s insufficient funds, with any other number used, it tells me it&#039;s the wrong pin. How could this possibly be other than a mistake on their end?<br /><br />TinyDot - the exceedingly strange thing is that I was never sent an email from bitinstant confirming my order or that it had been delivered. However, like I said to Biteme, it does show on Blockchain that an appropriate amount of BTC was deposited considering bitinstant&#039;s 4% charge and the wild prices of BTC currently.

				dantes682, your situation sucks but next time just put it into a MtGox account first, like maple said. <br /><br />To put it into perspective, people are constantly being scammed or losing 100gr orders of MDMA, coke, weed, etc in the mail. Shit gets lost all the time, what we&#039;re doing is illegal. I myself just got scammed out of a $300 order because the vendor &quot;required&quot; FE for customers with no history. It was 100% my fault for FE, but it still sucks. <br /><br />Save up for another few weeks, use bitinstant CVS/Walmart again, and make a great order from a trusted vendor =)

				M-addict <br /><br />You&#039;ve misunderstood friend, I wasn&#039;t screwed by a vendor, I wouldn&#039;t be mad if it was an FE fuck over,&nbsp; I understand the risk in that. But the funds never even made it to my SR account to begin with! :/
