				I got into drugs because i was put on psychiatric medications when i was 12 years old, and discovered that, hey, pharmaceutical things and chemicals can make me feel different... and by 14 i had a needle in my arm. such is life. broken home, family history of addiction, blah blah yeah yeah. <br /><br />plus DARE made everything sound very attractive.

				Watched everybody else in the 60s, 70s and 80s ... was insanely curious but fearful ... <br /><br />Finally decided it was on my bucket list ...<br /><br />For me, it&#039;s all about what makes the love insane, crazy and wonderful.<br /><br />It&#039;s good sober, it&#039;s good altered.&nbsp; But the alterations are sometimes just CRAZY good!

				i&#039;ve only ever smoked pot. i did it because i had a few friends in high school who did it and it seemed pretty fun. Had a few good times with it back then but then stopped completely for a few years. Got more into smoking it within the past 6 months due to my moms chronic back pain. She asked me to get some for her from a co-worker, which she then split with me and my friends. And now i&#039;m here. A more social smoker, SR user. The idea of dealing and making some money is pretty tantalizing due to the lack of hours i&#039;ve been getting at my job. I plan to do mushrooms or LSD at some point soon but i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll ever go anywhere past that. I&#039;m not a party person, my life is pretty decent
