				Not to be an ass, but do you really trust ANYTHING Alex Jones says? He&#039;s notoriously a sell out, jumping on any &quot;Big Brother Is Watching Us&quot; scheme he can.

Plus all the data taken is metadata, which is pretty useful, and a huge breach of privacy but also something which probably can&#039;t be used to target or prosecute you for SR type stuff as long as you are using TOR

				Clearly the U.S. government has been on an all out power grab since 9/11. Its sad that people let fear take hold and never once thought of the implications of giving his amount of power to the government. From a historical stand point the path America is on leads only only direction and that it tyranny. The U.S. has made a power play in an attempt to establish hegemony for the rest of the 21st century. It will be interesting to see where this leads and the international response from China and Russia.

				Even if they can find Silk Road, which they cannot because its not one single place..nobody can break PGP encryption. I hope they are looking at this, because only a fucking idiot would deny there is no market for this stuff. If everything on here were legal and taxed there would be a lot less fighting in this world and a lot more people would be better off. Governments want to believe we are bad people, we believe what goes in our body is OUR FUCKING BUSINESS not theirs!

				9/11 made it more aggressive but the CIA has had a history of doing this kind of thing. MK Ultra anyone? Now that was fucking crazy. They did experiments in the 60s with LSD, mind control, brainwashing, weird shit. The documents were officially declassified in 2001. Check the wiki article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_ultra&nbsp; It sounds like the kind of thing that crazy conspiracy theorists would spout, but it&#039;s on the books, officially real. Crazy shit haha!<br /><br />And check this out. One of those programs they would illegally dose people with LSD while at a brothel, and then watch them through 1 way mirrors having sex with the sex workers, while they took notes. <br /><br />&quot;In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels in San Francisco, California to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.[34] In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. The subjects were told that their &quot;trips&quot; would be extended indefinitely if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people being interrogated this way were CIA employees, U. S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this.[33] Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.[12]&quot;<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s from the wiki article. <br /><br />It&#039;s all the post war economic power trip that the US has been on since WWII, its just now that trip is starting to come to an end, things are slipping through their fingers.
