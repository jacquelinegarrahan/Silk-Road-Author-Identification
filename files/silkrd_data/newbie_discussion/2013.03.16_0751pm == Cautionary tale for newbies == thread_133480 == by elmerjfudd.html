				So here is my confession.... I&#039;m a complete idiot.&nbsp; Not just your average run of the mill idiot, I&#039;m talking the driving slow in the fast lane with the blinker on, singing to the radio, and texting kind of idiot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I clear every newbie hurdle, Tor, PGP, bit coins.... have everything in place ready to make my first order.&nbsp; I&#039;m so excited to be off the street and on the road I can hardly contain myself.&nbsp; That when I noticed the last line on the order page....... PIN. <br /><br />Fucking Cunty Mcshitlips!!!! I forgot my PIN.&nbsp; I used a completely new one and it&#039;s been several weeks of research and acclimating to this new online drug market.&nbsp; Well you&#039;ve got five shots to get it right I should be able to figure it out.&nbsp; Well, it turns out I don&#039;t really know me as well as I thought I did and five guesses wasn&#039;t enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am now in SilkRoad purgatory.&nbsp; While a month of research went by like a blink, when you&#039;re finally ready to buy 72 hours feels like an eternity.&nbsp; <br /><br />So fellow newbies learn from the mistakes of your old pal Elmer..... don&#039;t forget that PIN.&nbsp; <br /><br />EJF

				Yes there&#039;s a ticker on the top of the page now counting down the time.&nbsp; Once the punishment for my stupidity is over there will be link to a page that will allow me to reset my PIN.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for my first purchase....&nbsp; I was going to get some of Angelina&#039;s suckers.&nbsp; &nbsp; :P.

				Lol I did exactly the same! I didnt have a countdown on the homepage though I just had to wait for three days and then it asked me to reset it when i logged in. I thought I was never going to retrieve my coins at first though.

				Yeah I wrote my pw and pin down right after I made it (arguably stupid if I was ever raided) and it worked for a while.<br /><br />One thing I didn&#039;t write down was my forum password so I&#039;ve had to make a new account haha. Sucks 2 suck.

				The new account idea would be fine if you didn&#039;t have coins in the old account.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing by the time you got it all straightened out with SR support you could have just waited the three days.&nbsp; I&#039;m taking my punishment and using the time to learn more.&nbsp; Honestly I had no idea there were so many different mind altering things out there.&nbsp;

				&lt;--- This dude sucks with PINs and the likes... Usually not a huge issue given the options out there but the SR is such a unique beast it forced some outside the box type thinking... hmmmm.. what to do? that onion address is a pain in the as too.. and wallets? forget about it!!<br /><br />PGP is our friend!!<br /><br />Notepad&nbsp; (put all the details in here)---&gt;&nbsp; cut text into PGP client and encrypt using your key ---&gt; paste back to notepad and save as... whatever takes your fancy... whenever its needed its just a simple thing of decrypting and ... Wizards your uncle its that easy.<br /><br />ticks all the box&#039;s unless I&#039;ve missed something? <br /><br />Man I was bummed for you reading your post... so many idiots just go hammer for tongs and come out smelling rose like and then the smart ones outsmart themselves and lament in the darkness of no online drug deliveries... :-(<br /><br />Hope you get there, or here as it where, because without doubt SR has changed my life and made my day to day exsistance so much more peaceful and when nthat feeloing hits your good self... its all worth it..<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking it super easy with my drugs as these old bones don&#039;t cope so well like they used to but my stats are ;<br /><br />Total transactions: 30<br />Total spent: $4137.65<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br />and now its a little more! God I love this place... well sans this pathetic 50 posts crap.. which I noticed did not stop the forums being spammed yeterday! lol.. mean-styles I have some actual replies to posts that could help and&nbsp; they remain unsaid...<br /><br /><br />:-D<br /><br />

				Not a bad idea, but I&#039;m not a big fan of writing anything down when it comes to SR.&nbsp; The advantage of getting the 3 day lock out was my bitcoins are worth a ton more!!!

				LOL<br /><br />see there is the karma swinging back and slapping you in the face with BTC!! yeah I have rule with writing stuff down normally;<br /><br />don&#039;t write anything your not OK to be printed in the newspaper tomorrow...<br /><br />but by encrypting it through PGP and saving the encryption PGP block and naming the text file with the block in it something unrelated I feel like its a safe option. This way all the info I need is at hand (.onions for here and elsewhere, usernames, pins, even a pass or 2, not just written as it needs to be to be used but a code within the code so if anyone is lucky enough to get into the actual decrypted text, I reckon if that happens the universe has decided to fuck me cause its PGP!!, they still have to work out the code to have my pass.) so it covers me for the phishing scams (right onion every time) and keeps the important info on hand. Its also good because the passwords I do generate through my pass manager/maker are complicated to say the least.. Don&#039;t need to remember them as its just a cut and paste so they are just stupid complicated and long...<br /><br />There is a back up that if I need to I can get access to (failed HDD or whatever) but that&#039;s one I&#039;m keeping to myself... <br /><br />;-P<br /><br />This PGP message block text file is saved on the removable HDD that I have set up to run SR and so if the shit really hits the fan this HDD and whatever gear i have on hand goes into a box I have made and is promptly made useless to LE (another one I&#039;m keeping to myself but think fire sprinkler roof system and flip that coin... At the base though is that within 2 mins of starting this off the shit is gone... and even if they make it in my house before that 2 mins is up so long as I have the lid closed and the process started it cannot be stopped..<br /><br />Haha I don&#039;t even sell anything to anyone ever but .. well I guess I can do it like this so I do and it sets my mind at ease. Peace of mind = better quality of life for me and so it is worth it even if i never actually have any issues knowing this is set up like it is gives me&nbsp; daily satisfaction.
