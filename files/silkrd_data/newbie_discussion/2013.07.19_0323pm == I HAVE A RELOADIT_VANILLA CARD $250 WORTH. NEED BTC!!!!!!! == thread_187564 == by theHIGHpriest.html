				heard! I went to his site and I messged him just to see if he will respond. I dont get how is he scamming with almost a 100% rate and more than 300transactions. that makes me worry a little more now considering he has good feedback and a high rating.. i dont get how he can get that and scam ppl? unless he just started doing it? im new so idk if there are ways to make your profile look better than what it really is, or is there a way for vendors to comment on themselves to make them look better? ..

				He&#039;s been around for a while, hence the 300+ transactions and it hasn&#039;t been confirmed whether he&#039;s all out scamming. He&#039;s still on 100% because it&#039;s also based on the price of the item and the bitcoin listing are 0.00 so they don&#039;t hold much weight.

				You are essentially offering to sell a reloadit/vanilla card, and for that, you need a vendor account.&nbsp; So please stop advertising on the forums.&nbsp; If you need btc, you are free to use one of the vendors on the main site or some other non-SR source, but do not offer to sell things via the forum or your account will be deleted.

The last time I saw something like this it was a rip off. There are good, long time vendors who aren&#039;t a risk. Search them out and use them.

				I have $229 in coins (at the current rate as of 3:20am EST). If you&#039;ll take that for your $250, I&#039;ll sell them to you.
