				Its a new rule introduced to try and wipe out some of the constant BTC spammer scammers, just for the record a lot of members around here like to check out other members posts to see what they&#039;re like and how they portray themselves around the forum. If you want respect i would suggest not spamming random shit around the newbie board just to get your post count up. Instead why not try to help some other members out or even ask a few questions yourself if you haven&#039;t quite got to grips with everything.<br />They introduced the rule to stop spamming and all everyone does now is just spam to get their post count up.
