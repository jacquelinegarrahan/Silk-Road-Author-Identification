				It&#039;s been over a week since I ordered some stuff from him, and he can&#039;t even find the time to read my messages, let alone respond to them.&nbsp; Even though he logs in to fill new orders.<br /><br />I guess when you try to save money with a cut up product, you should expect cut up ass service too.

				I have used DT in the past (over a month ago) and was reasonably satisfied, product was mediocre, but you expect that from time to time, it&#039;s part of how things go.&nbsp; I made an order with him that he claims shipped 16 days ago (12 postal days).&nbsp; If it shipped he&#039;s apparently decided to use every postal service in the world to get it to me because it hasn&#039;t shown up.&nbsp; Since I&#039;d had good dealings with DT before, I finalized early because I had to be out of town when I expected the package.&nbsp; Lo and behold there has been no package.&nbsp; Worse, much worse, over the course of a week I&#039;ve messaged DT several times asking for as little info as a damned confirmation the package was actually sent and there was no mistake and maybe, just maybe, to check that tracking number he says he has and see if he could tell me when it would arrive.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t responded to a single message.&nbsp; I have dealt with a number of SR vendors and have had 33 transactions.&nbsp; 32 of them have been flawless, model transactions.&nbsp; This is the first time I have ever had this kind of absolutely inexcusable service, and it&#039;s the first time I&#039;m pretty sure I got scammed. <br /><br />I would strongly recommend that no one buy from DT if and until he gets it together.

				I don&#039;t care how busy you are, its extremely important to communicate with your customers. If you want to keep your customers. <br /><br /><br />I too am waiting to hear back from him and I originally ordered via Express a Gram and 2 bags.&nbsp; I did get a package the next day but what I got was 2 bags and a few mints. These were pretty fat bags for stamp bags and I have ordered from him before and got fat bags but this means I am missing a Gram. Having read from a recent rating that he sends 2&nbsp; x 1/2 gram bags as grams but these are a bit too light so I emailed asking him what he sent me.&nbsp; Was this a light gram minus the 2 bags or was this 2 fat bags minus a gram?&nbsp; &nbsp;Either way I am missing some product.&nbsp; I got a message that said I will fix this tomorrow along with a link to an address correction order.&nbsp; &nbsp;The next day the replacement shows shipped.&nbsp; This was 4 days ago.&nbsp; So I first assume that my replacement would be send Express as I originally payed for. It was not my error that the first order was not shipped complete.&nbsp; However its apparent that this is not the case.&nbsp; However I have been emailing him asking how it was shipped, what is actually being shipped (the whole order?) 2 bags? A gram? .&nbsp; I did notice the quality was not so great. The only thing I was happy about was that I did originally receive something the next day.&nbsp; Ok fine mistakes happen. If you make a mistake yet make a grand effort to fix the mistake your golden but if you don&#039;t respond to emails and leave people hanging I don&#039;t have any faith in you.&nbsp; I have yet to leave anybody any less than a 5 out of 5 and that is because almost all of my orders have been flawless as well I will give people a chance to fix errors as long as there is communication.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to know WHY I just need to know WHAT, HOW and WHEN.......... What is being done to fix this, How is this being shipped? When can I expect to get my order?

				Great. I just placed an order with this person, but good thing it was only for ONE stamp.&nbsp; I got him mixed up with the other Deezle, if you know what I mean, lol.&nbsp; Anyway, I ordered two days ago, and my order is still processing. I don&#039;t like reading this. Sounds like he was trying hard to get it together, but not hard enough if this is happening. Maybe some bite off more than they can chew?&nbsp; But bad customer service? There is no excuse for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, one of the ways I test vendors is to ALWAYS send a little message before ordering.&nbsp; If the person gets back to me fairly promptly, is polite, approachable, and willing to help me and&nbsp; reassure me, then they have my business. On the other hand, if my message is ignore or they write back without answering my questions or whatever, I move on.&nbsp; I have to have someone not only reliable, but someone I know will answer me when I need to contact him/her.

				I just placed an order with dieseltherapy and did his FE option to get an extra 20% free.&nbsp; but as soon as I FE&#039;d the product I ordered was taken off the list.&nbsp; So either I got some of the last stuff, or its possible I&#039;m getting screwed.&nbsp; Has anyone else had good experiences with DT out there?

				I just put this in Rumor Mill, but I thought I would post here, too. NOTE: if I DO receive, I promise to update and let everyone know. If you do not hear from me, assume I have still not received my (small) order.<br /><br />Hello! I am here with an update on my order, as promise.&nbsp; The short version?&nbsp; I am still waiting.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is the other version:<br /><br />On July 24th, I had a small amount of bitcoin in my account, and I PAID for the cheapest way to ship.&nbsp; Order is marked &quot;in transit on July 24th.&nbsp; It is now August 8th, and I just returned home from a mini getaway, and I received this message from Diesel:<br /><br />&quot;I mailed your package. You ordered the package under the first class no tracking no resolution option so there is no way that I can prove that it was shipped and you therefore agreed, in choosing that shipping option, not to take this into resolution. It is on its way though. I promise you that it was shipped.&quot;<br /><br />Well, if this was the case, this is the LONGEST I have ever waited for an order on Silk Road. I mean, after all, this is NOT an international order!&nbsp; NOTHING should take this long to receive: state to state.<br /><br />Compare this to the same exact situation with deluxedelivery.&nbsp; I did the SAME EXACT thing: Had a small amount&nbsp; of bitcoin in my account, so I ordered the&nbsp; cheapest way to ship. And BIG DIFFERENCE even here!&nbsp; DD&#039;s cheapest way to ship is: FREE, whereas DT&#039;s cost me a little bitcoin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ordered from deluxedelivery, ordered marked &quot;in transit&quot; July 30th, and I received on August 2nd!!&nbsp; And this is FREE shipping!&nbsp; <br /><br />When I order one stamp, I don&#039;t worry about it so much. I just kind of sit back and wait, but i certainly never expected for the order from deluxedelivery to arrive so quickly. But then, this is the way it SHOULD be state to state.&nbsp; A breath of fresh air after experiencing the opposite with DieselTherapy.<br /><br />My order could still arrive. If it does, I will be very pleased. But I will NEVER believe it was mailed when he said it was.&nbsp; The above proves it really could not have been.&nbsp; And if it never arrives, I will chalk it up to &quot;living and learning,&quot; and move on.&nbsp; And I will&nbsp; stick with those I know are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy.<br />&nbsp;<br />

				2 weeks isn&#039;t the end of the world for USPS domestic slow-post.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen tracked packages take 3 weeks state-to-state before.&nbsp; Sometimes packages follow the most ridiculous routes around the country before they get to you.&nbsp; Give it some time, you might see this package yet.

				I am still waiting.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see it taking this long when international orders have come sooner, plus compared to the other vendor whose product arrived in just a few days. I did receive a message, so I am hoping he will do something even though there is &quot;no resolution.&quot;&nbsp; It is not the biggest deal in the world for such a small amount.&nbsp; I will just keep waiting and see what happens.

				Dont finalise early its as simple as that, if they are an honest enough vendor they wont need you to finalise and the business will run through reputation, good products and customer service.
