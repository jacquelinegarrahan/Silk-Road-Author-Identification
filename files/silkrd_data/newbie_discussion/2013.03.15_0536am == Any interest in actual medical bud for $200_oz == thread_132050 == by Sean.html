				Hey guys been here for over a year but never really posted much. I am very interested in becoming a vendor. I am just posting this to see if there is any interest.<br /><br />The bud will be medical and shipping out of the bay area in California and New York (If you are on west half of the US, you get bud from CA. If on the east half the bud will be from NY)<br />It will be exactly the same but this is a cool lil setup to make sure its not in transit for very long. (we will have most bud stashed on east coast because thats where most customers will probably be, im assuming people in cali already got some nice connects lol.)<br /><br />All packages will not be crushed and we will be using moisture barrier bags.<br /><br />Prices will scale from 200/oz to 2400/lb<br /><br /><br />All this really depends on if there is an interest because essentially we will be renting two stash houses and hiring some people. (funded from our hand to hand transactions)<br /><br />thank you if you read this and im looking forward to doing business with all of you

				$200/oz sounds fantastic.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t purchase it if this lower price meant a lower quality bud, however.&nbsp; <br /><br />Currently, I&#039;ve purchased an ounce here for $235 and the quality was excellent (and it was overweight).&nbsp; It was the cheapest price on the Silk Road and I gave it a shot thinking that it was going to be low quality.&nbsp; It was on par with what I get locally for $340.<br />

				we will have competitive pricing! so expect it to possibly go lower and the quality will always be medical

				Well then, I hope to see you in the product listings soon!<br /><br />I was very pleased with my last vendor.&nbsp; I might have to start smoking twice as much so I can still order from you both. LOL

				Sounds legit but FYI when I order weed on here its because its stuff I can&#039;t get domestic. What I mean by that is include the strain name your listing and have great stuff, I love discovering new things I haven&#039;t tried. Most dealers IRL just try to sell as much as possible for as much profit as they can net. On here I can discover new things and great quality that&#039;s harder to find from people. That&#039;s SR biggest advantage to me so keep that in mind while selling. Just offering some personal perspective and:<br /><br />$200 ounce sounds legit as shit Im sure you would get plenty of business once you established some credibility.

				thanks for the advice! Also forgot to add we will not require FE.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big buyer here ($17,000 spent, lol could of bought another BMW!) and I am fully against vendors who make customers finalize 100% of the time.
