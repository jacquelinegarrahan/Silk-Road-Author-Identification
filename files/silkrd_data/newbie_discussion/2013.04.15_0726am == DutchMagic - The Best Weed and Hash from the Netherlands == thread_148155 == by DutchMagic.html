				All orders placed during the short uptime of SR on May 1 have not been shipped and cannot be confirmed at the moment. I apologise for the delay, I am just as frustrated as you are. I hope DPR works this all out fast.

				Within EU there are no customs so there shouln&#039;d be a problem. DutchMagic was also my first international shipment (to ger) and everything went well. Also I got 20g in a business-looking stealth letter so it was no big post package. When they now also would check every businessletter sent within the EU i think the postmans and customs would get crazy. <br /><br />And I know how you feel. First time I was on his profile i felt the same, like good old times in Maastricht (when it was still allowed for foreign persons to enter the coffeeshops&nbsp; :-* :-* )
