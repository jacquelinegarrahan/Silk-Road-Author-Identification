				Hi all<br />It seems as if I have made a rookie error in trying to buy my bitcoins. My first time here and I got so excited by the prospect of using sr that I rushed headlong into trying to buy coins. Could any kind souls take the time to point out my error(s) in my procedure and advise me of my best course of action from this point, as I think I am waiting on Bitcoins which may or may not arrive. Help me obie1konobie. You are my only hope. The force is very weak in me I think!<br />1. I set up my sr account through my tor browser<br />2. I then got the details I needed from bitcoin central and went to my bank and sent them some money as requested<br />3. Bank charged me Â£15 for the privelege (error 1) and I sent from my personal account (error 2?)<br />4. I was told 3 working days by my bank!<br />5. Came home disconsulate, but read some more, then decided to use btcxuk as they seemed a viable option from the uk. Again I sent mony from a personal account!!!!<br />6. I noticed my bitcoin account number has changed. Is this normal?<br />None of my funds are showing and btcxuk are not responding to my emails which do come from tormail.<br /><br />My suspicion is there are a catalog of errors in what I am doing. Could anyone guide me as to how I should have done things better. And could anyone make a guess as to how this is all gonna pan out for me. I guess we learn from our mistakes, but if this were the case I would be on a mountain top preaching to my pilgrims now as I seem to wander from one cock up to the next. Slightly tongue in cheek, but the general synopsis seems about right.<br />

				I can&#039;t comment on the specifics as I&#039;m neither in the UK nor use the coin exchanges you mention but I&#039;ll offer my 2c anyway.<br /><br />I know that my Btc exchange does not answer or acknowledge mail from Tor clients. As a matter of fact I think they reserve the right to cancel if an account is accessed via a Tor client.<br /><br />Bitcoins, in and of themselves, are perfectly legal so you have no need to try and maintain any anonymity when converting your cash to BTC. I&#039;m fairly new to this but my understanding is that the exchanges need to maintain an air of &quot;Bankishness&quot; so they are not seen as an easy anonymous way for criminals to launder their proceeds. On the other hand, there is nothing even slightly illegal about you or I buying BTC with funds from our personal bank accounts. As far as our banks are concerned, we are just transferring our money to somebody else, they don&#039;t care who. The exchange don&#039;t care what you want the BTC for either. Once your cash is converted to BTC you can transfer them anywhere you like. Your Bitcoin exchange has no idea whether the &quot;wallet&quot; you transferred your coins to was your sister, an anti-establishment artist in San-Francisco, or Silk Road.<br /><br />Your account number with whichever exchange you use should stay the same. The number of your bitcoin &quot;wallet&quot; is randomly generated and may change every time you use it.

				bit of a rodney eh. get a free wallet at blockchain. if you use btcxuk deposit cash rather than transfer from your personal account. have them send it to your blockchain wallet then send to your silkroad wallet from there(use a tumbler between those if you want to be extra careful). get a new bitcoin address on here after every transfer has cleared into your silkroad account.
