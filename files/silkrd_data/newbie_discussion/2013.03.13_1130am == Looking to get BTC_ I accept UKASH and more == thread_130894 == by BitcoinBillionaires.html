				What you don&#039;t seem to understand, david99, is that regardless of what happened, transactions involving the purchase of bitcoins are considered &quot;out of escrow&quot; transactions and will not be refunded or supported by SR.<br /><br />That said, so far you haven&#039;t posted any kind of proof of having actually done any kind of transaction with BitcoinBillionaires.

				Just want to add to this, I sent this guy around 9BTC for £300 cash in the post on Monday/Tuesday. Today I messaged him saying I want a refund if he hasn&#039;t posted the cash. He agreed and I am still waiting. He is reading my messages and not replying....<br /><br />I have said I will give him till tomorrow morning to send coins or I will be giving bad feedback and posting bad feedback in the forum.

				BitcoinBillionaires the fact that you&#039;re not trying to defend yourself on all the recent negative threads speaks volumes. The game is up.<br /><br />How can you possibly explain the reason for users not receiving their coins after them &#039;being sent&#039; yesterday.<br /><br />Would be very interesting to hear back. Not holding my breath though.<br /><br />Can someone with over 50 posts start a thread on the main board? If he doesn&#039;t come forward very soon we can at least stop other people being scammed.<br /><br />x<br /><br />

				This guy is a scammer, here&#039;s my story:<br /><br />I sent him a £150 Ukash voucher on Wednesday night, he had 100% feedback and I felt confident dealing with him.<br /><br />I contacted BitcoinBillionaires on Thursday after no coins appeared in my wallet, he claimed that he was having problems getting on SR and the coins would be with me today.<br /><br />After still no coins on Friday I contacted him again and he said everything was running smoothly and I&#039;d have my coins later that day, sound familiar?<br /><br />Saturday came and still no coins, after seeing that guys had left him 1/5 I (desperately) messaged him saying that if I received just 2 coins (£75 each!!) I would leave 5/5 feedback and remove all my comments from the forum. He replied on Sunday morning and said it was no problem and I&#039;d have my coins today.&nbsp;<br /><br />I messaged him again on Sunday afternoon after I removed all my forum comments and actually FE&#039;d (only 0.01btc)!! I know that wasn&#039;t the best thing to do but as UKash is out of escrow I was willing to try anything and hoped he&#039;d have the decency to give me even half the coins I was owed. The message was read but I got no reply. At this point I decided to message him on another account asking for UKash rates, he replied in 4mins saying £50 a bitcoin, it seems he has no problem relying or getting on SR when he&#039;s receiving money.<br /><br />I messaged him again this morning asking for just 2 bitcoins, read but no reply. I then messaged him on my other account with a UKash question and got a reply within a few mins.&nbsp;<br /><br />The thing that really got me was he posted on his sellers page that we were all lying and were trouble makers! He scams people and then calls them liars in public!<br /><br />I have screen shots of all the communication in case he tries to lie again, I&#039;ll also be sending him a link to this post but I doubt he&#039;ll even bother to defend himself.<br /><br />AVOID THIS SCAMMER NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS!!<br />

				I&#039;m suspicious that he is using buyer accounts to give himself good feedback, it&#039;s strange that someone would send him money after some of the recent feedback he&#039;s received. Even more strange that they feel the need to tell people I scamming him.<br /><br />If I&#039;m scamming him why doesn&#039;t he just show the block chain or transaction receipt?
