				Hypothetically of course. If you live somewhere where its legal to possess&nbsp; and give weed as a gift, but not legal to sell or buy, What&#039;s the legality of receiving some in the mail? Is the local legality irrelevant if its shipped across state lines?

				Local legality would be irrelevant even within the state or wherever becaue the USPS is a Federal entity.

I&#039;m not sure what would happen if you used a private mail carrier such as UPS, but maybe someone familiar with US law can chime in on that one.<br /><br />Libertas<br /><br />EDIT: twizzla got there before me!

In conjunction, you may face penalty in your home country as well, from what I have seen (they did this to a few guys on &quot;To Catch A Predator&quot; for the same class felony.)&nbsp; These are federal offenses, so its important to remember that state law isn&#039;t on your side in terms of mailing.<br /><br />However, I do believe that once you have the weed, have RID OF THE BOX IN WHICH IT CAME, you are free to have the weed, as governed by your state law.&nbsp; Since it&#039;s not the mail anymore, I doubt it&#039;s federal.<br /><br />In any event, given your situation, I would not order huge shipments at once.&nbsp; There&#039;s really no need to have a 200+ grams of weed delivered. I think that may even void the personal usage statues in your sate. Also, given that we have what seem to be good dealers here in the US, I see no reason to order domestic as that would invite the possibility of customs agents.
