				That&#039;s a pretty interesting story but I didn&#039;t understand the last part.. What do you mean he called you a &quot;fruit&quot;? That&#039;s not a bad word as far as I know. Care to elaborate on that?<br /><br />And so you now want to kill yourself because he called you a fruit or is it for something else? I understand you feel upset if your uncle was your role model and you realized he&#039;s not who you thought he was...

				Protip:&nbsp; stop caring what people say about you (even family).&nbsp; &nbsp;It will do wonders for your psyche and will truly set you free.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not saying turn your back on people.....just......understand that anyone can have an opinion on anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;We all have opinions.&nbsp; Some good, some bad.<br /><br />In other words, be a little selfish and stop worrying about how someone perceives you.&nbsp; Regardless of what you do or don&#039;t do, they will never truly understand -- because they aren&#039;t you.&nbsp; &nbsp;What they think of you is nothing more than an opinion so blow it off and move on if you can&#039;t work it out.<br /><br />I can&#039;t count how many people I thought were &quot;good&quot; (as you describe above).....only to be let down later when I learn more about who they really are and what they are all about.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, I don&#039;t hate people rather I just &quot;protect&quot; myself from letting them hurt me with their words and the only way to do that is to -truly- not give a fuck what they think.

				You need to chill brother!<br /><br />Life is awesome and way too short to worry what others say! <br /><br />If you feel that down or depressed you really should speak with your doctor. <br /><br />Things will get better for you my friend.

				I think whatever your uncle said was far more revealing of his own insecurities and possible embarrassment about the state he was in. Why take it personally if he projects his homophobia onto you? He&#039;s only human, and you&#039;re no less a man than he is. And perhaps his slight was a good thing: he&#039;s given you an opportunity to be greater, by forgiving him his weaknesses and flaws. <br /><br />Please come back to let us know you&#039;re okay! I don&#039;t know what your regular account is but this story made me worry so much for you. It&#039;s clear that you have an amazing heart, and that the world would suffer without it.

				That&#039;s an extremely sad story man! The one thing I would recommend is to do an internet search about the survivors that have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge in attempts to commit suicide. The one common theme of their testimonies is how IMMEDIATELY after they had let go and began falling they instantly realized how permanent the decision that they had made really was and instantly regretted it. <br /><br />Things will get better for you bro.&nbsp; :-\

				can&#039;t do suicide ( no matter if troll or not), the suicide is a give up (why not say to the rest of the world: fuck you and you go and die?)<br />the only excuse is about to be tortured to death by some nazi sadistic fucks<br />fuck, here&#039;s our life - nobody gives a fuck, the world is against you, your family is fucked up, you are doomed and done from the day one.<br />here&#039;s the plan:say go fuck yourselves (including all the advisers), then see clearly that you are on your own and just stay alive.<br />go&nbsp; for a nice walk in the park, get drunk and then think fuck the world, but you&#039;ll be ok<br />whatever amigos, don&#039;t go jumping of the bridges<br /><br /><br />

				People who talk nonsense name calling and remedial shit like that are only showing their insecurities.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what was said since its been edited out.&nbsp; But who gives a fuck what anyone says, even family.&nbsp; They&#039;re just miserable human beings trying to bring you down to their level.&nbsp; Don&#039;t stress it dude.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be good man.&nbsp; Life goes on.&nbsp; Wish you the best....
