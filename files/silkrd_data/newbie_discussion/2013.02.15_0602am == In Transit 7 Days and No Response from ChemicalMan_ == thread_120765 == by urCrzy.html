				I&#039;ve placed my 1st order on SR and I&#039;ve been waiting for priority shipping within the same country for a good amount of time now. I sent seller a privnote a day or two ago (he has no pgp) and I&#039;m still waiting. I was nice and brief about it. I just wanted to know about the tracking and where my package currently was at in transit. Should I cancel? I really don&#039;t want to cause my stats will make me look like the bad one. How much longer should I wait? Or should I send him another pm?

Also if your stats do get messed up, it&#039;s your first purchase so you could easily start fresh with another account.

				If there&#039;s only 1-2 days left to go until auto-finalize, make sure you hit &#039;resolve&#039; or else he&#039;ll be sent the bitcoins and you&#039;ll have an auto-finalize on your account.<br />You should also check his profile to see if the seller uses tormail.&nbsp; Even when/if you do receive the item, remember that you can leave feedback for the seller after the transaction.&nbsp; Be sure to leave feedback so others know to avoid certain sellers.<br />If you end up receiving a refund, yeah I would just create another SR account or else your refund rate will be at 100% and sellers will want you to FE.
