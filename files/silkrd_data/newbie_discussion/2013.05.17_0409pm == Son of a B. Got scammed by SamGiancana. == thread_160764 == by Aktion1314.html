				My first ever transaction with SR: SCAM. <br /><br />In retrospect:<br />It&#039;s April 25, 2013. <br />BTC is standing at 150$-ish maybe. <br />I decide to blow some BTC on meth because it&#039;s been a long time and I deserve it, dammit.<br />I make an order with an assclown named SamGiancana who I will now refer to as Sam Giancunt. <br />Sam Giantcunt is asking people to finalize early for an extra 20% of product and free shipping. <br />Sam Giantcunt marks my order as &#039;in transit&#039; and then the SR website got attacked so everything was pretty much impossible to access (was having a hard time with the forums too).<br />Warning signs for a scammer: 98% of this cunt-nugget&#039;s feedback read &#039;FE for extra 20%&#039;. I should have seen it coming... but nope.<br />I wait a week.<br />Another week...<br />...and another week. <br />Nope. Nothing. <br />I know, I&#039;ll send him a message on SR. Brilliant!<br />... but not really because this motherfucker doesn&#039;t even read his messages.... because fuck you Aktion, that&#039;s why. <br /><br />Apparently, Sam Giantcunt&#039;s vendor account was banned on April 26 or so, but I had absolutely no way to know this. <br />Conclusions: Some shady-ass meth dealers just act like shady-ass meth dealers.... <br />....and THIS is why we can&#039;t have nice things. Is it so fucking hard to not live up to your shitty stereotype, Sam Giantcunt? I seriously hope you get scabies. <br /><br />Some of us work for our money, while others take the easy way out and steal. <br />I&#039;m determined not to give up though. I hope to find someone on this website that CAN sell meth (and does shipping worldwide) without stealing my shit like a self-entitled money-hungry twat.<br />If you know anyone that fits the criteria, please lemme know.<br /><br />/end rant.

				That sucks bro...&nbsp; Pro tip - click Stimulants &gt; Meth - the first vendors you see are the best selling ones and are always the most reliable.&nbsp; If a price seems too good to be true - it probably is.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to pay more for piece of mind knowing your going to get quality shit quickly, versus paying paying dirt cheap to a scammer, or risking International custom confiscation.&nbsp; Hopefully it wasn&#039;t too much of a loss, so take it as a learning experience, as everyone has been ripped off on the streets at least once as well :(&nbsp;

				Thanks for the advice/sympathy Boob420! :)<br />Surprisingly enough, that route was the route I took. Sam Giancunt was just getting hella good reviews because lots of people were finalizing early.&nbsp; [.. and you&#039;re absolutely right, lessons learned.]<br />I just put in an order with another vendor (one that doesn&#039;t require FE). Hopefully this transaction will work out well.<br /><br />My faith in humanity (and my will to get high) shall prevail. Grin.

				Thanks PrinceOfSpades. :)<br />That&#039;s kind of how I realized I got screwed. Googled his username and viola! Unfortunately he was only properly labeled a scammer one day after I paid. Womp womp. :\<br />

				That is just shitty! I have yet to make my first purchase mostly because I&#039;m trying to find the right vendor. Then I read stuff like this and I get even more nervous! Anyway, sorry that happened to you and good luck in the future. Stay strong!

				&nbsp;Hey MrChinoCat&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I guess what I had to learn the hard way is that this isn&#039;t ebay and once I finalize anything I&#039;m acknowledging that the transaction is done. <br />Make little purchases at first so you can&#039;t get screwed on all your money right off the bat and NEVER ever FE. The FE thing is the biggest f&#039;n red flag ever. <br />So long as your purchase is still in escrow you&#039;ll be golden. <br />Also, google username + the silk road and find more info about the vendors via the forums. (The forum search has been failing me, so that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been doing).<br /><br />Thanks &amp; Good luck to you too, MrChinoCat

				sorry to hear this happened.<br />i take the rating system on SR with a grain of salt. i never consider &quot;5/5 FE&quot; a positive rating. plus you can&#039;t any information about the person leaving the feedback. for all i know they could just create a new account, make a purchase from themself and then give positive feedback to create an impression of quality<br />i always make sure to check a vendors forum page and see what people are saying there. i tend to take the opinions of people who have multiple posts and a history on the forums over someone new with 1 or 2 posts.<br />my buddy does meth and has had great success with an American vendor. he says the product, prices and stealth are top notch so it does exist!

				Excellent points, RobLoblaw, &amp; extra points for the arrested development reference (if only I could give you +1)&nbsp; :-X<br />I didn&#039;t even think about the fact that someone could just be giving themselves positive feedback. Damn.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear this but thanks for sharing, I never considered that too many feedback with FE could be warning sign. :P
