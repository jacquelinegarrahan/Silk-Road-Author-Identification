				yeah...I&#039;ve watched the Lab Testing thread...what&#039;s somewhat concerning is a vendor getting a new batch in (high purity, limited if any cuts in it)....sending out for testing.&nbsp; Test yields great results,&nbsp; said vendor then steps on it and boosts his margins....is that so far fetched? Ethics are one thing, but it&#039;s not like we&#039;re on here pitching Insurance underwriters?&nbsp;

				I agree, only the anonymous tests are worth reading, and even then the next batch might be different.&nbsp; The &#039;agreement&#039; tests I usually ignore, no vendor is going to send his after-cut product in.<br /><br />

				Look dude, Cartels control most of the domestic coke, right? They supply Distributors that cut once, maybe twice. They sell to dealers that cut again.. and again.. and now to the consumer. Either way, your coke is no where near pure unless you live on the border or have an amazing plug.

				In the real world, word travels. Good or bad, bad moves faster than good.&nbsp; &nbsp;But also in the real world, if you sell a sizeable amount that sucks.<br />Your health may suffer as a result.&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is why a new mark gets the bs, whats he gonna do really? Small amounts = large amounts of cut, for the most part.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no such deterrent here is there ?? It&#039;s not like you have to worry about an armed confrontation.<br /><br />In my younger days i played the game.&nbsp; Great contacts, real nice quality, fair prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only cut when i came up a bit short on weight. Common place.<br />I still made $ but never ripped anyone - anyone off.&nbsp; My small but trusted group was my backbone. Without them, i had a dangerous road ahead.<br />And i knew that well. A solid group takes time to build.&nbsp; Come to me for less that a ball it&#039;s gonna be cut- not bad but cut. Want more - less or no cut.<br /><br />The $$$ is in the weight. Too much risk and not enough $ in GR here and there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just my thoughts..........

				It&#039;s not what you guys think in regards to getting coke. Look at vendors pics and you can tell who has authentic bricks. I can name 6 vendors off pictures alone who is selling re compressed. And some vendors do show you one thing and send another. All the coke i just got in is official...It has been stepped on by no one. A percentage...I don&#039;t know. If I was to break out an eztest while swapping a bag of money for bricks I probably wouldn&#039;t hear back from my connect anymore. I want someone to purchase from NOD an eightball for 469 and I&#039;ll sell them a quarter for the same price and we&#039;ll see what the coke is in comparison. Or any vendor who sells coke with some retarded statement about its purity.
