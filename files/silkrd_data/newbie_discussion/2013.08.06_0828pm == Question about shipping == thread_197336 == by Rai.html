				Title: <strong>Question about shipping</strong><br />

				I&#039;ve moved into my new place of residence, and I&#039;m worried about ordering something off of SR. I live on a road that is very long, so instead of having mailboxes by every house, we have one big steel mailbox with compartments for every house at the beginning of the road. I was told if a package is too big for the box, it will be held at the post office and I would have to come pick it up in-person. Does anyone have any experience dealing with this? I hear that if they have to bring it back to the post office that they scan/video record the person who picks it up, and I&#039;d rather not go to jail right now. Does this also mean I&#039;ll have to send my actual name to the seller so I can pick it up, or can I say I&#039;m picking it up for a friend? I doubt anyone here has had to deal with this, I figured I might as well ask, though.

				Some people have different thoughts on this, but I would personally never pick up a drug filled package from the post office, even if there was only a small chance of getting caught.<br /><br />Make a test shipment. Send yourself a package about the size you&#039;d expect to receive from here, and see if they really do tell you to pick it up or if they just leave it at your door, because they still might.<br /><br />If they ask you to pick it up, I&#039;d find another address to receive shipments at.

				It also depends where you life. At my post office they require an id. They actually really thoroughly check the id, wouldn&#039;t even have to balls to go there with a fake one.

				if they ask for id and you make an excuse and get the hell out dont forget they have your face on cam, your address, and your package, and leaving it after being asked for id would only arouse suspicion

				I guess technically you could say you were picking it up for a friend, but if it&#039;s addressed to you that&#039;s sort of shady.<br />Going to the post office is a risk because of security and cameras..<br />might want to keep your orders small until you are able to scope the situation out better.<br /><br />Probably easier said than done..

				I&#039;ve picked up stuff from the post office before because the package didn&#039;t get held.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t open the package for 4 or 5 days, because if you&#039;re worried about a sting you still have some plausible deniability since it&#039;s not even opened.&nbsp; If you&#039;re ordering bulk or something.. well I don&#039;t think I&#039;d order that to my own house regardless.&nbsp; Personally, I think you&#039;re being too worried not picking it up at the post office.&nbsp; What are you afraid is going to happen?

				If you have to pick up packages at the PO then there&#039;s no way to differentiate between a controlled delivery and safe deliveries.<br /><br />Up to you to determine how much you value not getting ass raped in prison by criminals who haven&#039;t been near a wet twat in years/decades.<br /><br />
