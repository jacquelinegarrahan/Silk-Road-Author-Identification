				I&#039;ve done LSD from a few different suppliers before, along with tons of research chemicals. Psychedelics are great almost no matter what you take, but nothing can beat good clean LSD.<br />The greatest experience I have ever had with a drug was when a friend and I each took 3 tabs of Tessellated&#039;s White Label. About half after taking them things started getting weird. About an hour in I had to sit down because the sky, the people around me, the ground, everything was overlaid with crazy geometric patterns of color and light, and I needed to get a grasp on things. I looked over to my friend and his face was stretched and breathing, he had lines like electric tattoos pulsing and squirming along his entire body. I could tell by the look on his face that he saw the same thing in me too. This wasn&#039;t even the peak.<br /><br />What happened that day was absolutely amazing, and I have serious respect for the people who risk their freedom to bring this wonderful molecule to people.<br /><br />What would you like to say about LSD?

				It really was! My friend and I had done the other tabs the week before and we spent this trip at the beach on a beautiful day in August.
