				In reply to the discussion in the main thread (which I can&#039;t post in because I just registered)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=143732.0<br /><br />K Queen is cancelling orders for unknown reasons. Possibly due to people not FE fast enough, but in my case I didn&#039;t have chance. I obsessively checked it all day, but always &#039;processing&#039;. Woke up the next day and the orders were cancelled.<br /><br />Some people in the other thread are reporting other suspicious activity.<br /><br />Very disappointing for a seemingly very reputable vendor.

				Be glad she cancelled your order. I FE&#039;d like a dumbass because a couple of buddies and I have a 5 day vacation lined up next week because things have been shitty for all of us lately so we decided to throw down on some for the vacation. We are by no means wealthy so the vacation we had lined up was pretty pricey for us to begin with, and the fact that this girl is just reading my messages....sucks to put lightly... In my message I explain the whole situation and need to know whats going on in a non-argumentative tone...and now we don&#039;t really have any drug money... i honestly can&#039;t believe how much shit can go wrong in my life in such a short span of time. It&#039;s really something else and I&#039;m trying to keep calm.<br /><br />I love how the main reason I wanted ket was for the serotonin reuptake because life is weak lately and what do you know I get scammed. LOL...i feel so shitty and im in such disbelief that im like not even angry. It&#039;s fucked up honestly...and what sucks EVEN MORE is my boys are giving me shit for not reading the comments and just going based off her ratings...like cmon Im fairly new here but I figured that was more than enough. I did read some comments but they were all FE&#039;s....it&#039;s just an all around shit day for me. If we dont have the product or a message from the vendor by tuesday or wednesday we&#039;re calling the vacation off. Shits really depressing to be honest
