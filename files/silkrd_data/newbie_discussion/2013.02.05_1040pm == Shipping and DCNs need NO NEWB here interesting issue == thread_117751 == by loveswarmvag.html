				So I ordered a package from overseas from a non drug country. Well the package made it thru customs with flying colors. It was shipped directly to the zip code of the area the package was suppose to be delivered. Upon arriving at this particular postal center it remained there for 4-5 days before being sent to the central one in the my town. It has sat there for 2 weeks just sitting. Has anyone ever seen this happen before? Most folks would freak out but nothing at all is at my house and I know what to do with control delieveries and such. I am no newb to SR and know what im doing but this is really weird. Any vets input would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />someone also told me not to search for packages using tor because they know something is up. I think that is BS I am not going to use my normal IP that would be insane.

				DCNs are occasionally a complete lie - I have had them claim delivery one day, then &quot;out for delivery&quot; three days later before the customer actually receives it. Regardless, it should have arrived by now, I think, but hopefully it&#039;s just temporarily misplaced or something. Two weeks is a rather long time, but I would just keep clean as you have been doing. If it ends up getting seized, sorry to hear that, I hope it&#039;s small.<br /><br />As far as checking DCNs over Tor, there have been extremely rare reports of packages getting flagged - to my knowledge none of those reports are actually from SR (feel free to correct me). Even so, it&#039;s really easy to just go to a third-party site to check it, which is what I do. It&#039;s not a bulletproof solution, but I trust private sites more than usps.com. One could argue that a private site could implement code to catch Tor IPs easier than usps.com due to lower traffic volume (plus maybe the reports were fear tactics designed to trick us into using said &quot;third-party&quot; honeypots... hard to say). Either way, it&#039;s certainly not a guarantee that it will get your package flagged, considering a lot of people on here have never even heard of that rule and still receive their packages - I don&#039;t understand why USPS would do it at all if not consistently.<br /><br />I hope this helped in a small way; good luck getting your items and keeping out of trouble.<br />Peace
