				i have used a fake name for deliveries here in the UK, is this advised? my reasoning is that if it gets intercepted i can deny all knowledge... but am now thinking, what if (whoever) at the post office starts to notice a regular delivery to my address with this other name on it... will this raise any flags anywhere? i mean will i be suspected of like fraud or some shit? should i just go ahead and use my real name and in the case of anything getting intercepted still just deny all knowledge, i mean the product isnt in my hands so i cant get done for possession, can i get done for trying to import items?

Think about it this way, the only way to be caught is a controlled delivery (where they intercept it and then deliver it while making you sign for your package, then bust your door down). If you have:<br /><br />1 - Sent to your own name.... &quot;Why the fuck would I send drugs to myself? I didn&#039;t know what was in it!&quot;<br /><br />2 - Sent to a different name... &quot;errr no I&#039;m not sure why I have a package for somebody else or why I signed for it and accepted it...&quot;

				Using a fake name is generally not recommended, for various reasons. Here they are, not necessarily in order of importance:<br /><br />The vendor may refuse any refund if package is lost since you used a fake name.<br /><br />If for some reason the postman is unable to deliver the package (a legitimate non-delivery, not a case of a controlled delivery)<br />and you have to go to the post office to pick it up, you are going to have a hard time producing ID.<br /><br />Just because you use a fake id doesn&#039;t mean they cannot charge you.&nbsp; Sure, you can say you have no idea what it is and you didn&#039;t order it because it doesn&#039;t have your name on it but you can do exactly the same thing if it were to arrive in your name (with the exception that you cannot say it wasn&#039;t addressed to you).&nbsp; The fake name just means it&#039;s more likely that the it might not get delivered.<br /><br />If you were to search the forums you would see this question has been asked numerous times and the answer is usually don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />The most common recommendation is to use your own name but spell it slightly differently, something like:<br />Jon instead of John, Jonson instead of Johnson, that sort of thing.&nbsp; It makes it more likely the package will be delivered and you can once again say, hey, I didn&#039;t order anything, it&#039;s not mine, it isn&#039;t even the correct spelling.<br /><br />The main thing to remember is keep your place clean, or as least keep everything in one place to make it easy to quickly get rid of everything on short notice in case your place is ever searched.&nbsp; Never sign for something unless you know for a fact it requires a signature, as in the case of your ordering the item to be delivered express international (most international express shipments require a signature). Most local express shipments do not require a signature, although sometimes the vendor can make a mistake and they ask for a signature.&nbsp; Stay aware, know who your regular postman is.&nbsp; If someone shows up asking you to sign and you don&#039;t recognize them and you feel it isn&#039;t just a mistake, don&#039;t sign if you are unsure.&nbsp; If your package is coming first class mail and someone asks you to sign, obviously you mustn&#039;t sign anything as first class mail should never require a signature.<br /><br />If you are really feeling skittish, don&#039;t open the package right away.&nbsp; Write &#039;return to sender&#039; on the outside of the envelope and leave it unopened for an hour or so.&nbsp; If they are going to come knocking on your door they will do it fairly quickly so you don&#039;t have time to get rid of the package.&nbsp; If you are worried, take the package somewhere else.<br /><br />Your best bet is to always order domestic.&nbsp; There is much less chance of the package being discovered if it never goes through customs.<br /><br />One other thing you could try is to use the name of a previous tenant.&nbsp; Just make sure that the previous tenant hasn&#039;t purchased an address redirect service from the post office.&nbsp; Send yourself a test envelope with that name and address to see if it gets through.&nbsp; But, remember, if you do have to sign for it for some reason you may be screwed if they want ID.
