				I&#039;m fairly new to heroin but believe that the salt is more effective for snorting than the base...<br /><br />From chem class I remember that acid+base = salt+water. So if I had a bunch of heroin #3 could I just add some vinegar/citric acid then wait for the liquid to evaporate off and be left with a pile of salt that would be better for snorting?<br /><br />Either way, it has to go up the nose. Smoking anything make me cough my lungs inside out and I&#039;m terrified of needles&nbsp; :&#039;(

				its alot harder then that it might work but will be nothing like #4. Dont use vinegar as citric acid is the go. Why not just buy #4 save yourself the hassel?

				I was looking through the h listings and i&#039;m a little confused about #3 vs #4.&nbsp; I thought all h for export was #4... my source book on the shelf being McCoy&#039;s &quot;Politics of H in SE Asia&quot;... he says #3 is less than 10% ...the #3 i&#039;ve seen on SR looks exactly like some things i&#039;ve run across, both in the states and in UK.&nbsp; My UK friends thought all they were getting was #3, but it was around 50-60%. It looked and smelled just like what we&#039;ve had in the US @ times(70%-80%), only with more crap mixed in.&nbsp; Anyone know if the #3 is actually #3 or is there some other naming convention i&#039;m unaware of?&nbsp; Thanx! <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry i&#039;m off topic - my UK &quot;#3&quot; snorted just fine as long as it was absolutely crushed n powdered as fine as it would go.&nbsp; A little bit of warm water chaser and it worked on the plane home just fine-- I usually just dip two fingers in warm water and send the drops up to wash it in.&nbsp; They were smoking it - ugh!

				#3 would be a lot cheaper &amp; easier for me to get hold of, hence the desire to make some DIY #4. As far as I was aware #3 is the base form, it needs acid adding to it to make it soluble - I guess that would make it cross the nasal membranes easier?<br /><br />Any reason for avoiding vinegar? I gather it&#039;ll fuck your veins up but wouldn&#039;t have thought that would apply here?

				Here&#039;s a way to snort it<br /><br />Put it on aluminum foil, heat the bottom of the foil, stick a straw in your nose, take a deep breath

				Hi PK, that was EXACTLY the UK Way for non-injectors.&nbsp; Injectors mixed drops of the citric acid in so it wouldn&#039;t burn their veins.&nbsp; BP, I am ransacking my bookshelf looking for my McCoy.... he has the &quot;recipe&quot; in one of his chapters, at least the one they were using in the SE Asia labs.&nbsp; Grr maybe it&#039;s out on loan...&nbsp; &nbsp;at any rate, I remember he said that the conversion from #3 to #4 was not very complex but VERY flammable -- something like dissolving it in ether, adding Something, and then using vacuum pressure to draw it off and leave nice fluffy white flakes.&nbsp; Careful there!! You don&#039;t want to set the place on fire trying to get a little higher...&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have it in yr hand yet, don&#039;t worry too much about it...either smoke it w/ the foil or crush it, snort it, n wash it back.&nbsp; Either way you&#039;ll get the goodies IN.

Citric acid, fumaric acid will work fine but Muriatic acid (HCl) would work too and if you use HCl you don&#039;t have to worry about excess acid.<br />Just dissolve your heroin #3 in a diluted HCl solution and let the water evaporate. All the excess HCl will evaporate too and you will be left with Heroin Hydrochloride

				Thanks for the info guys. I guess there&#039;s only one way to know for sure so if one day I&#039;m bored and well stocked I may well give it a go and will post back with the results...
