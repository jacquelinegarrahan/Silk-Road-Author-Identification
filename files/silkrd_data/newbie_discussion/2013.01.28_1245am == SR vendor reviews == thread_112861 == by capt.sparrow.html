				Post in here about your experience with vendors, quality of product, service, etc.<br /><br /><br />My first review is for the Canadian hash amd shroom vendor known as Oz.<br /><br />I placed an order for an Oz of golden teacher shroom powder.<br /><br />I chose the FE early shipping option due to having slightly less then i needed loaded to pay for the non FE option.<br /><br />Vendor never messaged me to get me to FE, when i messaged him to inquire on it and if my order had been sent, he apologized for not getting back to me on it sooner and told me he wouldn&#039;t require me to FE in that instance. <br /><br />about 9 shipping days later, i received my order. 2 grams over weight, beautiful looking product, vacuum sealed, indistinguishable. <br /><br />Immediately finalized out of faith.<br /><br />A problem came up, several customers were complaining about the quality, i unfortunately have not tested them myself due to having a very high psychedelic tolerance at the moment.<br /><br />Decided to message the vendor and get his thought on this.<br /><br />He messaged me telling me how it seemed weird to him and that no one else has complained, regardless of that, he immediately refunded me the entire cost of the order without me even asking.<br />&nbsp;<br />This vendor has gone above and beyond to prove to me hes not a scammer or trying to rip me off in anyway. At this point, I&#039;m sure people were bull shitting with me about the potency to try and get free hook ups.<br /><br />I plan on trying his product as soon as possible, and afterwards plan on sending him back the money. this vendors offered me amazing service and is absolutely legitimate in every way, I&#039;d definitely recommend this vendor to anyone looking for cheap hash or shrooms. <br /><br />Very pleased with this transaction, especially with the amazing service i received. I have, since then, also had a good friend try out his product and he said it was very good.<br />So i have no doubt about the legitimacy of the product.<br /><br />&nbsp;Very much looking forward to doing business again with this vendor. <br /><br />

				Hey I am writing a review for this great new vendor WEEDMASTER101. They were very helpful in making a custom order for me at a good price for this very nice GIRL SCOUT COOKIES and BLUE CHEESAL all untrimmed bud. The bud is very nice and I don&#039;t mind pulling off the little leaves myself because the price was right an the bud is dank! It smells and smokes great, also the stealth was super. Give this vendor a chance they are really nice and professional.

				Just make sure when it is your time to review to give the vendor an actual review. MOST are just happy it came and to get loaded and leave a review like &quot; FEed early. This vendor is the man&quot;. This is useless. Review on things like:<br /><br />1. Communication (did they bather to protect you both with encryption)?<br />&nbsp;Many dont. If they cant care to protect themselves, they damn sure are not going to care to protect you.<br />2. Packaging and Stealth <br />Again many just throw shit in an envelope or box. Its unbelievable that more have not been caught this way. I have straight up gotten packages with sandwich baggies wrapped in paper towels inside an envelope. THATS IT. Thats all that was protecting my ass from being disclosed? NO THANKS!!! Again. If they cant protect themselves, you can bet your shipping info doesnt get deleted and you are at risk with said vendor. TICKING TIME BOMBS!!!!<br />3. Product Quality. <br />This often takes precedence over the CLEARLY MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES STATED ABOVE. But is not wothout value. <br />Did vendor require FE (against rules like MANY MANY DO)? This is not only AGAINST POLICY AND RULES BUT IS ALSO A SHADY PRACTICE. Vendors that require this usually require it because their foreign vendor does not care to use stealth. And most in China that I have used dont care to use any stealth at all. Or its really non believable anyway. So they will gladly &quot;middle man&quot; your funds and take their cut. But to your risk alone. So why bother with the middle man. Go straight to overseas yourself and leave out the dead weight ad leech on the system. Some do this because the country of destination is too strict. Well I say they should earn their cut if they require it to be so. <br /><br />There are many vendors with &quot;good intentions&quot; and that willget things to your door. BUT ITS MOSTLY LUCK. There are some who want to remain free and make money. Greed and laziness does not come first over safety, rules, security, stealth and freedom! Good luck and welcome to SR.

That&#039;s where most of the vendor review threads. Unfortunately it&#039;s one of the places where noobs can&#039;t post or even reply to existing topics.<br /><br />Granted this is close to one of those &quot;haven&#039;t tried will update&quot; posts but I just received a few orders at once and did mini reviews on all of them.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.msg1478129#msg1478129<br /><br />See my edit but basically I tested 2 out of 3 so far and that&#039;s going to be my limit for tonight.&nbsp; But yeah if you have a certain product in mind look for a topic on that.&nbsp; Usually if you hear a lot of people talking about someone and it&#039;s not even in their review thread, it may be someone to look into.

				I have done business with a few vendors:<br />SEALTEAM6: It was my first few transactions, but I didn&#039;t run into any trouble. He also had his own special strain of bud at the time, which was great. Fast shipping, and also really great stealth. Very professional.<br /><br />ENBOOM: I got 25i from ENBOOM, the stealth was always great, the vendor was fast.<br /><br />SYMBIOSIS: Symbiosis was always fast, professional and the stealth was fairly good. The last time I ordered MDMA I felt like it was a little less pure, though it tested straight to black every time on the reagant. Still good vendor!<br /><br />MARCEL KETMAN: I heard of him from some experienced k users, I tried him and out and was not disappointed! I screwed up the pgp on my first order with him, and messed up by making another order, trying to cancel the first, and he was professional and fantastic the whole way! Very understanding and very fast with responses.<br />Also, his product both times was great! Some of the best k my friends and I have ever had. Great vendor.<br /><br />TESSELATED: Ohmygoodness, the best LSD I have ever had, the same was true for my friends that I gave it to. He always sent a nice message in response to me, and his stealth was great! Always going back.<br /><br />ALASKA: have yet to try this LSD, but it came timely and was good stealth. I&#039;ll report back after this weekend.

				INSTAGRAMS: stealth was good and creative, but I worry that it&#039;d be easy for dogs to sniff out.<br />BUT the product was a great price and THE best MDMA I&#039;ve ever had. My friends and I could roll (lightly, but still good) off of only .1 (My friends and I usually take quite a bit more than that.)<br /><br />DEEMZBEEMZ: Fantastic vendor!! He was very responsive, understanding, accommodating, and he shipped in only 2 days for free! I bought it as a birthday present, and my friend LOVED it. Great DMT. I hope to venture into it some time soon.

				Cyclone: Koh Samui super strain mushrooms<br /><br />I have about 10 trips under my belt from random mushroom hookups and some philosopher stone shrooms i got from the road and DAMN were these some good shrooms. My thoughts were spiraling into each other and everything was breathing. I walked through my neighborhood that i grew up in and knew like the back of my hand but almost got lost multiple times since my sense of time and my ability to focus was soooo fucked up. i had to light a cigar 5 times because i forgot about it right after the first hit each time. it later fell apart in my hand which was hilarious and tragic since we had named it berry the blunt: R.I.P. many jokes were had with my friend as we tripped throughout the night. We basically just shit on everything we saw like how some people dedicate their lives to learning the names of useless plants. his fat ass wouldn&#039;t race me, that was a little depressing since i wanted to see what my body could do but nothing could really dampen my mood. I saw a sign that said &quot;adopt a spot&quot; pointed it out to my friend, made fun of the concept of adopting a spot and promptly said &quot;congratulations&quot; and left. we saw a big splatter on the sidewalk and inferred that it was either paint or someone got stabbed in our upper class suburb, which we reenacted. also everything was in a pinkinsh purple hue when we were outside. that was off 3 grams, my friend only had 2. good times. <br /><br />as far as the vender goes, very professional. He answered all of my questions quickly and was very detailed with his answers. The stealth packaging wasnt as good as my last purchase from the road but it was decent. it was at my house two days after he shipped it, great experience overall.

				Cyanspore: quick shipping, good guy, great shrooms, good stealth. Likely won&#039;t buy shrooms from anyone else as long as he&#039;s around :)<br /><br />silo: quick shipping, really good 25c-NBOMe, creative (good) stealth.<br /><br />TheDaggaCouple: currently waiting for the package to arrive, seems like a good guy, will update this when I get it (I&#039;ve been hearing great things about swazi buds :) )
