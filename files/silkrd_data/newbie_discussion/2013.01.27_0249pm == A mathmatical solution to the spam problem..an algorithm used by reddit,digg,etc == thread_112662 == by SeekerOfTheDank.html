Anything marked as spam could be moved to a different sub forum and deleted every 2 weeks if it isn&#039;t moved by admins....<br /><br />Please bump if you agree so someone will see this post

				The reason why this hasn&#039;t been implemented is cos then anyone would be able to mark and move anyone as spam ddoooooooooohhhhh algorithm that in your pipe n smoke it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha joke nah this is the reason why this sort of code ain&#039;t allowed

				There could be several reasons it isn&#039;t being implemented. <br /><br />It might also add to server loads.<br />The SR staff have more important things to worry about (security), and the 50 posts was implemented as a quick fix.

				I&#039;m going to guess the other issue is that the forum is running Simple Machines. So unless it&#039;s something Simple Machines added themselves or maybe a very trusted secure plugin/addin, that would mean having to modify the PHP to add this feature.
