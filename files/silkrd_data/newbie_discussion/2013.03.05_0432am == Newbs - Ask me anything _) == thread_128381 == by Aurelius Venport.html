				I&#039;ve been around SR a while now and know the ropes more or less.<br /><br />I am constantly learning new things and gaining more knowledge so I don&#039;t claim to know it all, but I can probably help out some newer members with figuring things out.<br /><br />I know when I first started I was pretty lost :D lots of SR members helped out and I am paying it forward.

				I have heard from a couple sources now that you can&#039;t just start out buy grams of coke... you have to work your way up to that by gaining &quot;trust&quot; or whatever&nbsp; by buyins smaller amounts of substances and gradually moving up to bigger things, so the vendor knows you&#039;re legitimate. Will you shine some light on this?

				have you ever fucked on shrooms and (assuming you&#039;re a dude) been able to feel your girl cuming with your dick. It&#039;s crazy - you can feel her getting hotter and hotter because of the extra sensory perception or something that the shrooms give you. I have had this happen several times with several girls. It&#039;s fucking insane. But everyone that I&#039;ve asked about it looks at me like I&#039;m a crazy person. But I swear to you, as it was happening I could pinpoint the exact moment of her climax regardless of whether or not she was saying anything or making any sounds or other indications. I could have been blindfolded and had plugs in my ears and still predicted her climax. Super fun.<br /><br />Anyone else?<br /><br />Anyone? <br /><br />Bueller?

				Hey, <br />I&#039;m not sure if you use tails or anything but every time I shut down the computer and reboot later, my PGP keys are gone. And when I try to import them from another usb I get an error screen that&nbsp; says UID is missing or it&#039;s not signed.&nbsp; So I guess in short, how do you save the pgp keys if tails erases everything saved on the computer at each shut down. <br /><br />Thanks for the help

				I use GPG.<br /><br />There is a few threads on the main forum for PGP help.<br /><br />The member Astor is really helpful with PGP stuff, search his posts.<br /><br />I am not huge on PGP, I trust the site integrity. That said, I normally use it as an extra precaution.
