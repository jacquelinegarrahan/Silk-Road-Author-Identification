I&#039;ve got 48 hours off from the world, man. I&#039;m gonna blow steam out my head like a screaming kettle, I&#039;m gonna talk cod shit to strangers all night, I&#039;m gonna lose the plot on the dancefloor. The free radicals inside me are freakin&#039;, man! Tonight I&#039;m Jip Travolta, I&#039;m Peter Popper, I&#039;m going to never-never land with my chosen family, man. We&#039;re gonna get more spaced out than Neil Armstrong ever did, anything could happen tonight, you know? This could be the best night of my life.

				The whole concept of a newbie board is stupid as fuck. Some people only comment when they have something useful to say, this board is just guaranteeing that everyone posting is going to be used to spamming pointless bullshit by the time they make it to the rest of the boards.&nbsp; That being said I still have quite a ways to go with the bullshit spamming.

This is to prevent spammers. It&#039;s also why you can&#039;t post in that other thread.

				I&#039;m a bit annoyed... Registered to the forums after one year of lurking just to write a good and comprehensive review of Juergen2001&#039;s white double washed MDMA because many people have been asking about it but no on has done it so far. But apparently it&#039;s not going to happen. :( <br /><br />But to keep it brief: had a nice roll last night with it. It&#039;s good and pure, took a little less than normally but it had me rolling nicely still. Had tried his brown one before and I think the price difference is justified and not a rip-off. They are both good but the white stuff is more potent so you pay more but you need a bit less. I wasn&#039;t overwhelmed by the purity or the experience, but it was on par with my normal rolls with a bit less (125mg vs. 150mg, done E about ten times, last time two months ago). Looking forward to trying it with a slightly larger dose after some time. My gf had a very nice time with 90mg (third time, after 6 months).

				A 50 post target seems to be quite a clever one, it seems like as you approach 50 the desire to reach it is just marginally stronger than the desire to kill yourself and end it all. Bravo.

				Only 46 posts left. It&#039;s silly to require 50 posts in the same section in order to post in other sections. It could be set up to require 50 posts before users can create new threads or something like that instead. I would like to post vendor reviews without having to post 50 spam responses first.

				Once you make it to 50 posts, you can post in the other forums on the board. That means able to again&nbsp; make reviews in the vendor threads concerning your orders, taking part in the introductions thread (ironic it wasn&#039;t moved into this forum), etc.

				Well I haven&#039;t typed the report yet, but since you guys are curious, I&#039;ll write it up now! This might be a bit long.<br /><br />Previously to yesterday, I have never taken a hallucinogen except for Salvia a few years ago. Salvia was interesting but I never wanted to do it again. Anyway, my roommate and I took 2 of LucyDrops tabs each, both first timers, at 2pm yesterday. We started to feel something at around 2:45-3pm, just light sensations, as we delve deeper into the rabbit hole, into &quot;Wonderland.&quot; I first noticed a shadow of one of my large speakers floating &amp; rotating, like on a cloud. We were both VERY positive and full of excitement. We decided to play Mario Kart Double Dash on Gamecube as we were approaching the peak, and it was so much fun. My roommate won 1st place in every single game, and we were so engaged to the colorful levels. Following the Mario Kart fun, we observed the giant mirror in our living room and made friends with our reflective counterparts. It was amazing!<br /><br />At around 4:30pm, we took a 30minute walk outside, around the busy city streets. Life was incredibly magnificent and beautiful, I felt so insignificant and significant at the same time. The sun was setting and the colors were so vivid and lush. I was drawn towards the sun, it was so lovely. We started walking back home after a certain point, and just kept taking in the raw beauty of everything, man made &amp; nature together. I felt like I was standing still on a moving walkway, just floating around everywhere.<br /><br />Afterwards, we decided to play Guitar Hero, which was an AWESOME idea. My roommate is insane on the drums, both in the game and in real life (we&#039;ll get to that part soon), while I played guitar. We started off with Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden and I was immediately 100% engaged in the game, dancing and rocking out on another level. We played a few more songs and ended with Uprising by Muse, which I equally got sucked into. After we were done rocking out, we went upstairs and played real music. My roommate got on his drum kit and I cracked my guitar amp and we just JAMMED for 30 minutes. Our groove was so experimental, funky, and just, groovy. I poured so much heart and soul into my guitar playing.<br /><br />We then went downstairs to eat some stuff we bought earlier from the grocery store. Raspberries, mango slices, strawberry ice pops, and more. We put on some music, turned on our 42&quot; HDTV visualizer, fired up the DJ lights, turned on the blacklights, and finally turned off the lights. Throughout our trip, we listened to so much stuff. Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Netsky, JIMI HENDRIX, Bob Marley, Jamiroquai, and much more. Jamiroquai made me dance for 30 minutes straight, and I mean DANCE. So funky. As for Jimi Hendrix, I have to say his music took me to another world. I felt the raw soul and feeling of his playing, voice, and from the rest of his band. I HIGHLY recommend listening to his version of the Star Spangled Banner live at Woodstock. Jimi was making sounds that BLEW my mind, and to think he was doing that in the 1960s..<br /><br />My roommate had some realizations about his beliefs in God, which he shared with me. We also agreed that this experience, LSD, was like being a little kid again. We found so much excitement and fun throughout the whole experience. Also, I should note that we tried smoking weed about 5-6hrs into the trip. It boosted the experience and was great. I also tried smoking some Damiana, which make me even more positive and happy. At some point, we decided to each take a hot shower with our own music on. It was the best shower I&#039;ve ever taken to say the least. The water felt wonderful, and the music I picked was perfect. The first song, which was the majority of the shower, was Aqueous Transmissions by Incubus. Literally the best shower song while tripping, in my opinion. Go look it up on youtube, it is highly peaceful. At the end of the song, there are sounds of frogs croaking for a good minute, which was very lovely and peaceful. <br /><br />After the shower we gave each other some alone time, with my roommate browsing his computer and becoming introspective, while I put on a movie in my room. The movie of choice? Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Result? I could not stop laughing, everything was hilarious. <br /><br />Following the movie, we listened to some more music downstairs, and I decided to eat a meal. I heated up some Panang Curry &amp; rice w/ Orange Juice as a drink, and it was delicious. I smoked some more weed around 1am, and was able to peacefully fall asleep. I woke up 6hrs later feeling great.<br /><br />I could say a million other things, but this is my general trip report, for a first timer. LucyDrop is an amazing vendor. I ordered 10 tabs on Friday, and received them Tuesday. My roommate and I both have 3 tabs left each, for another journey in the future. <br /><br /><br />Thanks to anyone who read this, feel free to provide any comments, ec.&nbsp; :)

				After the shower we gave each other some own time!! Is that some gay euphemism, Joking well that is certainly a positive result. But really what did your room mate need some introspective time? Does that mean he wanted to watch some porn?&nbsp; :-[ ;) What a report you should consider writing full time 8)

Nah, neither of us is gay. My roommate definitely didn&#039;t masturbate because he recently got on Zoloft and said he cannot orgasm for a couple more weeks. I believe he was looking up trippy stuff on the internet, some info on LSD. After our showers (we each have our own), he was just occupied with whatever he was doing, for a while. I was getting engaged into Austin Powers hah. I was honestly curious how porn would be, or sex, but I&#039;ll leave that to another time.<br /><br />Thanks for the compliment! I enjoyed writing that report up, I hope it was interesting.

				I would have edited this in with the previous post, but kind of counter productive to do that now. <br /><br />The thing that disappoints me the most about the new posting requirements (although I understand the reasoning behind it) is the inability to participate in reviews of vendors and the reviews I read here when I first started were invaluable in my decisions to place my first orders. I always search a vendor&#039;s name here before purchasing to try and make an informed decision. <br /><br />On the other hand, I suppose that not allowing newbies to participate in the reviews will stop folks from making new names and posting shill reviews. <br /><br />Oh well, in a year or so at my pace, I&#039;ll have full access.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />
