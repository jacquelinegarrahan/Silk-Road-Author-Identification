				All of that depends on the details of your particular case, so no one here can really tell you the outcome or whether or not you&#039;ll get a 100% refund.&nbsp; I&#039;m also not sure whether or not you can get an admin to review it sooner - you were the one who extended his due date, so I wouldn&#039;t think you could &quot;undo&quot; that choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, if you really were scammed, 7 days isn&#039;t going to make a non-existent package show up any faster!&nbsp; What I mean is - if the vendor scammed you and never sent a thing, you&#039;re not going to be receiving anything in 7 days so it&#039;s just a matter of waiting (which isn&#039;t always easy, i know).

				Ya well i understand when the vendor has actual reviews getting only 50% if a package doesnt show. but in this guys case he has 0% positive feedback and 3 of 3 reviews from people saying he scammed them like me.<br /><br />does SR give 100% back in OBVIOUS scam cases?

				Hey Nomad, I need someone with more expiereince to answer a few question I have reguarding the same subject. <br /><br />I placed an order on 1/15 with the vendor KushCartel, he was fairly new but had great feedback and good reviews despite only having 30 transactions.I messaged him about 4-5 times before I made my order for a QP. He assured me that the package would be sent out the next day and that he would send a DCN number &quot;immediately&quot;. The next day I noticed that my order still hadn&#039;t been marked &quot;in transit&quot; which was weird since he said that the package would be shipped out right away the next day. I figured he was busy and that everything was fine. My order changed to &quot;in transit&quot; on 1/18. Truth be told I was already having a weird feeling and was really wishing he would hold off 2 more days so I could just cancel it and place an order with a vendor I trust and have used before. Nonetheless, the order has been &quot;in transit&quot; since the 18th and he wont message me or several others back who have placed orders with him back. I found this very fishy since he was so quick to message me back before I made the order but since then he has only sent me 2 messages such as &quot;I assure you that you are in the best of hands brother&quot; and things like that.<br />Now he has actually been called out for being a scammer and I&#039;ve sort of accepted that there will be no package coming. However, the resolution center isn&#039;t available for another 4 days and I&#039;m not one of the wealthiest people so I sort of needed that bud to help make some income on the side, that of which I haven&#039;t been able to do since my money has been sitting in escrow. Now I know that I&#039;m protected in some way since I stayed in escrow I&#039;m just wondering what exactly I need to do to make things go as fast and smoothly as&nbsp; possible so that I can get my money back in full. I&#039;ve never had to deal with the resolution center since I try to steer clear of vendors like this. I&#039;m also wondering if there is a proactive approach to dealing with this? can I speed the review process up in any way or anything? I made a foolish decision despite trying to use my best judgement and am now pretty worried about what will happen and if/when I can even get my money back. <br /><br />Thanks in advance for any input!<br />&nbsp;

				If he shipped something on the18th, don&#039;t forget that Monday was a holiday ... so it could just still be in transit.

He also said that he would send a DCN number &quot;immediately&quot; which he hasn&#039;t, despite being online everyday. He has even messaged a couple other people who have bought from but won&#039;t message those of us who ordered bulk from him back. In face he wont even open them so that it gets marked as read. I wouldn&#039;t be coming to this conclusion if it was just me, there are many others that are in the same boat as I am. Some even placed their orders days before mine. Why are there so many precautions to protect the vendors from being scammed and the only thing the buyer can do is stay in escrow? The vendor has the upper hand 100% of the time. The buyer is the one who has to reveal personal information such as an address and stuff and all the vendor has to do is write up something for his vendor page, post some pictures of weed that he googled and bam he starts stealing peoples money.

SR takes a lot of precautions to protect buyers!&nbsp; The escrow system works!&nbsp; As long the buyer stays in escrow, they are protected and won&#039;t lose any money if the vendor never sends the package.<br /><br />You did stay in escrow, right?&nbsp; If so, you have nothing to worry about.

I&#039;ve never had to deal with the resolution center before, which is why I had a bunch of questions. I&#039;m just wondering if anyone knows how long it takes to get your money back. I read up at begging of this forum that you only get 50% at first instead of a full refund? I&#039;m famaliar with what I need to do but not too sure what will happen like with the refunding and stuff so if anyone knows how that works let me know!
