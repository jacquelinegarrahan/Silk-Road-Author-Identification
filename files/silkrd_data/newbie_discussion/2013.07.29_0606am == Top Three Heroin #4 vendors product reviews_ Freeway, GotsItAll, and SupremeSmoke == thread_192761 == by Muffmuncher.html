				I&#039;m here to review 3 heroin #4 vendors known for having top quality products. Freeway (FW), GotsItAll (GIA) , and SupremeSmoke (SS). All three have awesome products but you will see they are on the more expensive side of the #4 listings. Ill do my best to break it down so you can see how much you would spend per dose. I&#039;m sure many of u do a much higher dose than I do, some maybe less, but I try to keep my tolerance low and not push my limits.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a whole lot of money to spend but enough that I was able to get a 1/2g from FW and SS and a full g from GIA. I got SS and GIA&#039;s product first as there was a complication with shipping on fW&#039;s end that wasnt his fault, and he reshipped no questions asked and also is offering to compensate for the troubles by sending a little more this coming week when he has more product.&nbsp; I did receive FW&#039;s product too and like the other 2, they were all fire. One thing i noticed is that FW&#039;s .5g listing is cheaper than SS&#039;s, but SS has a cheaper 1g listing. Both within $20 of each other but still, ill incorporate that into here as well. Ill break it down now by price, mg per $1, and how much each one of my shots cost me. <br /><br />Freeway:<br />&nbsp;.5g&nbsp; $141.91<br />3.54mg per $1<br />15-20mg doses<br />$4.23-$5.64 per dose<br /><br />GotsItAll:<br />1g $227.62<br />4.40 per $1 <br />25-30mg doses<br />$5.68-$6.81 per dose<br /><br />SupremeSmoke:<br />.5g $163<br />3.06 per $1<br />15-20mg doses<br />$4.90-6.53 per dose <br /><br />FW and SS had almost the same quality product, with a good strong rush, but I remember my first shot of FW&#039;s knocking me on my ass. GIA&#039;s doesn&#039;t seem to have as intense of a rush, and I was able to do more at a time, but the high itself lasted a loooong time. That made his bag last awhile. And mixing SS&#039;s and GIA&#039;s together in the same hit was awesome because u got an intense rush and nods that seemed to last for days. All 3 are very high quality products. Based on above, I would say Freeway has the best deal UNTIL you change those .5g listings to full 1g listings. <br />One side note I mentioned above is when you go to the 1g listing for both FW and SS, the table turns on the cheaper product. <br /><br />Freeway:<br />1g $259.52<br />3.86mg per 1$<br />15-20mg dose<br />$3.88-$5.18 per dose<br /><br />SupremeSmoke:<br />1g $243.54<br />4.11mg per 1$<br />15-20mg dose<br />$3.64-$4.86 per dose. <br /><br />So if u have the $ to buy full g&#039;s then GotsItAll appears to have the better deal, but SS will get you more bang for your buck in terms of potency. <br /><br />I will say that there was no communication between myself and SS although I didn&#039;t really need to talk to him. But FW and GIA were both very willing to talk and were very helpful all around. Shipping times were all as advertised (except that mixup with FW but that was not his fault at all). The stealth was adequate for all of them except SS hand wrote the address, and I would prefer a types address. They all had sufficient eye barriers and vacuum seal. The products themselves all cooked down nicely but FW had probably the least residue, but not by much. All three were very clean. All in all, all three vendors are very professional, and depending on how much $ I had, I would probably choose FW again for a half g, especially since he is now offering free cut separate (awesome if u are buying bulk) and quickly took the hit and reshipped the lost package. Only complaint for GIA is I didn&#039;t feel as much of a rush with his, but my wife actually preferred it because it lasted so much longer than the others. Also he has the least expensive gram of the 3. Buying a gram, I would probably go to SupremeSmoke simply because its a bit cheaper. I didn&#039;t include shipping in here cuz I don&#039;t remember their shipping costs, but that could also be a factor in how much $ u wanna spend. In conclusion, I can&#039;t say any are better by a long shot, as they are all very professional, helpful, and have absolutely the top quality products to offer. Remember that this is only from these batches of h, and they may have a better batch when u order from them. I would, and probably will, order from these gents again.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are other vendors with comparable product, and I have tried many but not all of them. Lots of cheap #4 u can get that isn&#039;t as potent, and many are great vendors providing stamps and what not at a very low price. Vendors like diesel therapy, deluxe delivery, Terabithia (who had an issue this month and I had to goto resolution myself with him, but I&#039;ve spoken with him and he fully intends to make up for what happened and hopes people will give him a chance to do so). SubsRgood is another awesome vendor with great product. I don&#039;t think his is as good as these guys with his product but it isn&#039;t quite as expensive, or maybe I didn&#039;t get his best batch cuz I&#039;ve heard others say it was as good. Regardless, buy from Subs and u will not be disappointed at all. He is a phenomenal vendor. Subs is among the top vendors for h on the road, and while his listings are down he sends his customers to GIA, which says something about GIA as a vendor if another vendor is sending him business in his absence. <br /><br />Warning for new SR H buyers: UndergroundSyndicate has very cheap $163 grams, of very potent very strong h from supertrips. its well known his supertrips mdma is some of the best on the road and i can say from experience that his mdma is fuckin awesome. Because of this, it seems like a great idea to go for his super cheap #4 since u will get the best deal through him. That&#039;s because it isn&#039;t heroin. It will look like h, cook like h, and u will get the rush like h. But it doesn&#039;t last very long at all and thus you keep doing it and end up in your bed passed out with blue lips struggling to breathe while your wife is screaming, crying, and slapping u to try and wake you and u end up in the hospital with a fentanyl overdose. UGS is a great vendor with great Molly, but from personal experience, stay away from his and SuperTrips heroin, unless of course u are of with it being fentanyl, in which case fire away and e careful. Rumors are that people have died from it, and the above experience is my own. Just be safe. (I mean no disrespect to UGS here. He is an awesome vendor and has always treated me very well. I may disagree with him advertising #4 when it has tested as otherwise, but his MDMA is awesome and he had great communication and fast shipping times. Still overall a great vendor.)<br /><br />I got an order from Marlo on the way. If its worth it, ill throw him into the mix here. Last thing: BE CAREFUL!! All 3 of these products are very very potent. You can always do more but can never do less. I can do over 50mg of some stuff but I can&#039;t even do half that with these guys. I watched a friend come very close to an od on this shit (combo of GIA&#039;s and SS&#039;s product) cuz he is stupid and this h is so strong. This shit is raw, pure, and needs to be respected. Hope this was helpful and would like for this to start a further discussion on these and other vendors. Thanks for reading and have a happy nod!!

				Who is fm again? I could probably look and find out but I&#039;m feeling lazy. I picked these 3 cuz I was able to get all of theirs at the same time and they seem to have the highest quality stuff based on my research before buying. Marlo Stanfields stuff was surprisingly weak. It&#039;s what I have right now and it takes quite a bit to get me &quot;there.&quot; It was still a perfect transaction and came in like one big fat rock (over 850mg) and a smaller one to make it a gram. But alot of residue isn&#039;t over when cooked down. Idk enough about h to be able to tell what the cut is, but the rock and residue are all white/off-white.

				Hey muffy! So your telling me your doing approx 20mg doses? So your getting 50 shots out of a gram??? That seems insanely high to me, although your breakdowns were very informative. I just have a hard time believing that, do you have a pretty low tolerance?

I just have a hard time believing that, do you have a pretty low tolerance?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When I initially wrote this review, the doses were accurate. My tolerance has gone up a bit because I&#039;ve been using quite a but more (spent over $2000 since starting this thread) than I had prior to this. I&#039;m by no means a noob to opiates, but it consisted of OCs and opanas, until they added that shit that made it almost impossible to snort. I did h for the first time around June 2011, but not very frequently. This past spring I started using the Silk Road more (used to only get mdma) and started getting alot of h. I&#039;ve gone out of my way to keep my tolerance low, for personal and financial reasons. I only really do it on the weekends because of random drug tests at work, and using it for 3-4 days straight gets me a little dope sick. I&#039;ve seen addict friends get truly dope sick, ad tats enough reason for me to take breaks. I&#039;ve used many vendors here (subsrgood, gotsitall, SupremeSmoke, Terabithia, diesel therapy, dieseltime, deluxe delivery, marlostanfield, &quot;maestro&quot; or however u spell it, and a couple others I can&#039;t remember right now) so my review here is pretty educated given the selections on the road. Haven&#039;t tried 10toes or dragoncove, and since finding freeway, I don&#039;t see a reason to just yet. <br />At this point, I&#039;ve narrowed it down to 2 vendors. I mentioned I would be trying out Marlo&#039;s heroin. Ill day now,&nbsp; Marlostanfield is most definitely not one of those btw. I got a g from him, which was pretty inexpensive (compared to some)&nbsp; at $180 with shipping, but it was not good at all. Maybe I got a bad batch, cuz others seem to love it. I tend to think these people haven&#039;t tried the more expensive stuff so are comparing it to street garbage, although this was worse than some I&#039;ve bought off the street. I was excited at first cuz it came in one big 800mg rock and 2 smaller rocks. Unfortunately, I got barely any rush from 65mg (try to keep my tolerance low), it left alot of white residue in the spoon, most I&#039;ve seen ever, and after the shot I would itch like crazy, all over. He says on his profile to do less or take Benadryl, but I&#039;ve never had anything like this from other h. Like I said, maybe a bad batch, but I won&#039;t be ordering again. <br /><br />My last order I placed with FW and SS allowed me to make a final determination on whose was truly better. I was gonna get a half g of each, but for the same price i was able to get a g from SS and a 1/4g from FW. I was doin 30-40mg and eventually 50mg of SS&#039;s dope toward the end of the bag, and about 30-35mg of FW&#039;s shit. I would be stoned and nodding out after a shit from ss&#039;s bag, and do 30mg of FW&#039;s and get a rush all over again. While SupremeSmoke has some great dope, FW&#039;s is better. I wouldn&#039;t say by a long shot, but for sure better.<br />&nbsp;Here is some other reasons to buy from FreeWay over others, and how it&#039;s worth the $:<br />Communication:<br />&nbsp;FW hasn&#039;t had a listing up in a couple weeks but I&#039;ve still stayed in contact with him, which is awesome from a buyers standpoint. SS never responded to my concerns though, while FW has addressed and fixed or promised to fix any little thing. He has promised everyone that was involved with a shipping error, that wasnt even his fault and included multiple buyers, a full free reship (which came through) and a hookup in the future when he can make a little back that he lost in the whole debacle. He has stayed in contact with me about this, and even reminded everyone on his profile page that he hasn&#039;t forgot. I mentioned he should have a listing between 1g and 6g, and low and behold, he puts up a 3.5g listing. He not only responds in a timely man or, but actually cares and listens. He seems to know that every customer counts. SS has not responded to my quite large concern which brings me to the next topic.<br />Shipping/Stealth:<br />We have probably all had dope that smells like vinegar a little. I got this last g from SS, and from first glance the stealth was fine. Ill add that it arrived 2 days express, which is normal because I live in a rural area. He always gets it shipped in a timely manor from my experience. But as I opened the multiple envelopes, I gy to the last one and could smell that vinigsr smell. I found the dope in a piece of paper, rolled up in suran wrap. No baggie, no vacuum seal, none of that. I was pretty pissed, as FWs came the same day with great stealth and a Baggie in a Baggie in a vacuum seal. I should not be able to smell the product b4 I get to it, and if I can then a dog surely can. That was totally unacceptable to me, as its my safety in jeopardy. I have bought from SS 3 times and there was no vacuum seal any time, and it was packaged the same. This last time was the only time I smelled it, but it only takes one time. I messaged him after the first 2 orders expressing my concern. Nothing back. The 3rd time I left it in his feedback because I was pissed. U still left him a 5/5, but a lower rating I feel was justified. I&#039;m just a nice guy I guess. Also, I&#039;ve noticed SS and FW have like the same picture for their listings. Pretty sure FW had it first since I remember SS&#039;s old picture of china white, like a triangular shaped rock. Idk, this isn&#039;t a big deal to me but weird and maybe worth noting. <br />Product:<br />Both SS and FW have superb product, but FW leaves little to no residue, and SS leaves a tiny bit. Not a big deal at all. I had a few bigger chunks with SS that I didn&#039;t have with FW, but FW&#039;s was slightly stronger. Not my much, as they are both very potent, but te winner here is freeway. If not for the product, then for everything else. Still SS has a slightly lower gram price, and FW has cheaper fractions of a gram, but is say its worth the extra $20 to go with freeway. I don&#039;t see how anyone could not be satisfied. <br /><br />Ill also add that while FW has had no listings, I&#039;ve been using DT. His &quot;blue diamond&quot; h is ok. I&#039;d say half the potency of freeways, but with his current sale going on, it&#039;s cheap. I do about 55-75mg depending, and had a good rush with nice long legs. I&#039;m nodding on it right now actually. He also often throws in freebies, whether its a free stamp or a few Xanax mints (they are fuckin legit)DT is a good choice. He had a FE for an extra 20% of your order goin on a few weeks ago. And if u want even cheaper stuff, he has grams for $85. Not very strong at all, but super cheap. I&#039;ve had nothing but great service from him, except he doesn&#039;t respond to messages, like ever, u less its a serious concern. But to each his own. I would still recommend him to anyone, as he has kept me happy the last few weekends. Any questions are welcome and ill update if I need to, or add reviews on other vendors if they are worth trying. Thanks!!<br />
