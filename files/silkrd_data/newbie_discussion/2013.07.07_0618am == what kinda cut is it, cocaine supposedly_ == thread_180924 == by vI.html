				anyways, got a gram from a local guy who&#039;s hit and miss quality guy.<br /><br />so do a nice line - 10 min later nothing, so i keep going.<br /><br />basically by the end of half the baggie got some buzz which is not bad, but fuck it took almost half a gram in an hour.<br /><br />anyway, no bad side effects though - burn, crazy eyes or being jumpy, and the stuff seems to be absorbing ok.<br /><br />guessing there&#039;s maybe 10% of good stuff and the rest are cuts, not sure what it is though, don&#039;t think it&#039;s meth since i would have been a mess buy now.<br /><br />maybe ephedrine, but veins are not to small, fuckin puzzle what&#039;s in it, done almost a fuckin gram in about&nbsp; 2 hours and feel kinda normal, maybe a bit hot but not bad.<br /><br />maybe some caffeine in it but probably very little, could the whole thing be some kind of molly?

				Probably it&#039;s cut with something not active, like glucose/lactose.<br />You won&#039;t feel it, but the weigh is right.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT

				thanks youcantouchthis, guessing organic food type cuts would cause nasty congestion though and i&#039;ve got none. <br /><br />really never seen a cut like that, mean almost got thru the whole bag in less than 3 hours with almost no side effects but the buzz is like i would of had after doing couple of lines of the good stuff.<br /><br />tastes a bit bitter but not too much, maybe ritalin lol.

				Sounds like a lot of inactive cut there. Could be some leva there as well so I advice you to find a new source

				like everyone else said -- probably cut with something inert and therefore &quot;harmless&quot;

				update: guessing it was effin mdma lol<br /><br />anyways, had a little buzz that night and ended up doing a lot since it&#039;s the bad stuff that makes you chase, the good stuff you&#039;d need just a bit since it works as it should.<br /><br />after i was done i had a nasty hot flashes and got all hot and sweaty, molly does that, no?<br /><br />and a week later had the same exact stuff from anther guy, learned the hard way, if the stuff does not work properly then better not chase.<br /><br />that other night done a biggie line with my buddy and we are sitting there for 10 minutes and nothing happens, after an hour we are&nbsp; thru almost half the bag sitting there sweating with some weak short lasting buzz.<br /><br />mdma, no? think there was not even 5% cocaine in the stuff. maybe mephedrone?

				Definately not mdma. Inactive cuts or caffeine since u got so minor effects.<br /><br />Dont waste any more money on that shitty quality. Consider confronting the guy telling him its way to cut for u to keep buying and ask for the good stuff - then ask for a line to test before buying anything. It should be in his interest to provide an ok product to a possible longterm client, so to speak.<br /><br />Or just order from bungee54.&nbsp; Best coke on SR in my opinion.<br /><br />Cheers
