				Ah fuck anything dude. <br /><br />MDMA , amphetamines, coke, opiates, hallucinigens , etc, , - will make you last forever with a solid hard on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, testosterone injections make a huge difference in sexual performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Viagra doesn&#039;t always work for everyone.&nbsp; Cialis works for other people.&nbsp; Hose are only erectile distinction. <br /><br />I can never cum when I&#039;m too high or drunk.&nbsp; I just last forever until she&nbsp; cums .&nbsp; <br />

				As a personal antidote I&#039;m currently on anti-depressants (prozac). It&#039;s like ejaculating is an on / off switch. I can just go and go and go but when I want to climax I can put in that little extra and go for it.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d share ha.

				Dopamine agonists (particularly Cabergoline) have been reported to facilitate multiple orgasms, reducing the refractory period in men, though I didn&#039;t notice much of an effect when I tried it myself.&nbsp; YMMV

				I dont have a problem keeping hard so tend to go for drugs to make sex more pleasurable/mad/dirty<br /><br />2-CB fave drug for fucking, a light trip on this makes for a hillarious filthy night love it and can cum no probs but can go for hours<br /><br />MDMA: amazing naked fun but I dont cum, just fuck for hours in a blissed out way.&nbsp; usually feel really horny next day too and then give her my load!<br /><br />hash/weed: bit variable for me but recently had an absolutely amazing time very high on hash with my gf....totally filthy and i thought i was going to go into orbit when i came....wow ;-)<br /><br />LSD: once only (i was 18 at the time) and it was insane...bit disorientated and ended up leaving cum on my gf&#039;s parents living room wall (dont ask!!) and they found it the next day...i never went round again<br /><br />never tried viagra, coke is ok but makes me less good as a lover and any other drugs not above I havnt done or fucked on

				Have to agree with Abraxas, pre-ban mephedrone was the best. Couldn&#039;t get a hard on immediately after doing a line, had to wait an hour or two after, still buzzing but could fuck like a stallion, in fact often got exhausted before I could cum. Funny, recent stuff I&#039;ve been getting just doesn&#039;t have the same effect, gets me horny but doesn&#039;t enhance performance.

				<br />Watching this thread!&nbsp; Whatever drug the OP needs, I apparently need some of the same thing. As a young man, no worries at all. Hard as a rock and if I ever did come fast,&nbsp; I could be right up there and pounding away again within a few minutes.<br /><br />Now, middle-aged, my boners are weak and don&#039;t last long enough. Getting old is a bitch. I take test injections every week but that hasn&#039;t helped. Maybe I need to switch from Cyp to Enanthate...at any rate, I ordered some Viagra Sunday...we&#039;ll see if that works for me. I really don&#039;t like speedy drugs personally. Isn&#039;t the mephedrone speedy as hell?<br /><br /><br />

				MrMiller your story sounds the same as mine.&nbsp; Only I have tried Viagra and Cialis and neither of them worked for me but they worked well for my friend (same pills).&nbsp; I love making love on MDMA but can only get off 50% of the time.&nbsp; Weed might be my new favorite.&nbsp; I swear we both wake up sore the next morning from the intensity.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been on prescription opiates for several years, and am only in my late 20s, but it&#039;s definitely difficult to &quot;finish&quot;. Probably 1/3 of the time when I have sex, it ends with me just giving up because there&#039;s no way I&#039;m getting off. Does help please the girl being able to go forever. Sometimes it&#039;s even hard to pass water and I find myself standing in front of the urinal just hoping I&#039;ll be able to pee.

Thanks for the info. X came out when I was in my mid to late teens, I think. I bought what was supposed to be a couple of hits once, but I apparently got ripped off, because it didn&#039;t do anything. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know....I guess I&#039;m just getting nostalgic. When we were younger, we&#039;d have some wild ass times. Just filthy rambunctious pig sex. Name it and we&#039;ve done it or been in the same room while others did it but for the last ten years or so, it&#039;s gotten kind of boring. I would not mind having an evening like we used to every now and again. ;)
