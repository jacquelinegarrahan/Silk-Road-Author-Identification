				Post-whoring my way to 50....<br /><br />A lot of people are confused by the apparent opiate-blocking effect of Suboxone, and what naloxone has to do with it.<br /><br />Buprenorphine itself can have antagonistic qualities in some situations; the naloxone has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />As you know, psychotropic drugs work by binding to receptors in the cell membranes of brain cells.&nbsp; There are a number of different ways of describing this binding.&nbsp; For example, how specific is it?&nbsp; Will the drug bind to numerous receptors or just a small subset?&nbsp; How long does the binding last for?&nbsp; How &quot;sticky&quot; is the binding?&nbsp; Is it easy, hard, or impossible to knock the drug off the receptor?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any number of drugs can bind a given receptor, and may have similar effects (eg, morphine, heroin, oxycodone).&nbsp; Some bind a receptor and have no effect at all; and to the extent they displace effective chemicals, they can block the effect of a drug.&nbsp; <br /><br />So let&#039;s consider three actions at the opiate receptor:<br />1.&nbsp; Heroin:&nbsp; binds and activates.<br />2.&nbsp; Naloxone:&nbsp; binds and does nothing, thereby taking that receptor out of action for a while<br />3.&nbsp; Buprenorphine:&nbsp; binds but doesn&#039;t do all that much.<br /><br />Buprenorphine is high affinity and low potency.&nbsp; By high affinity I mean it will knock heroin or oxycodone off the receptor, and keep them off.&nbsp; It does stimulate the receptor, just not as much as heroin does.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re drug-naive, burprenorphine can give you opiate effects.&nbsp; You can use it for pain control, for example.<br /><br />But if you have a head full of heroin, the buprenorphine is not going to have nearly the effect you&#039;re used to.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will feel like withdrawal to you.&nbsp; <br /><br />It will likely be an all-or-nothing effect.&nbsp; 12mg of buprenorphine is enough to cover every single opiate receptor in your brain.&nbsp; Fortunately this is a one-way street.&nbsp; If you have a head full of heroin or methadone, and take a bunch of buprenorphine on top of that, you will not likely have a very pleasant day as you suddenly and massively exchange one drug for another.&nbsp; But if you have a head full of buprenorphine, taking heroin or oxycodone won&#039;t make you sick, because it is difficult for those drugs to displace the buprenorphine off the receptors.&nbsp; &nbsp; More likely you will at least partially block their effects, although I&#039;m told that if you take enough opiates, you can power through the buprenorphine effect.&nbsp; Still, that&#039;s a useful property.&nbsp; Helps guard against relapses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Naloxone is not orally active.&nbsp; It&#039;s in Suboxone as a public health service to punish people for shooting it up.&nbsp; I&#039;m told there&#039;s a way of cooking it up to remove all or most of the naloxone, so I guess it&#039;s not totally effective in this regard.<br /><br />There&#039;s a civil liberties angle on this, and a good practices angle.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t prescribe two drugs when one will do, and you shouldn&#039;t force someone to take something they don&#039;t need to satisfy the ambivalence of some politician about drug treatment.&nbsp; But that&#039;s what it is.<br /><br />Note: naloxone and naltrexone are two different things.&nbsp; Naltrexone is an oral opioid antagonist, and can be used to treat addiction and other things, like certain forms of autism.&nbsp; Naloxone doesn&#039;t do anything if you swallow it, you have to snort it or inject it to experience that pain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Moral of the story:&nbsp; generic Subutex is gonna basically be the same from the consumer&#039;s viewpoint as brand-name Suboxone.&nbsp; The rest is politics.&nbsp;

				&quot;Naloxone doesn&#039;t do anything if you swallow it, you have to snort it or inject it to experience that pain.&quot;<br /><br />Isn&#039;t Suboxone the same as Subutex, in that you dissolve it under the tongue? Why would anyone want to shoot it up?<br /><br /><br />
