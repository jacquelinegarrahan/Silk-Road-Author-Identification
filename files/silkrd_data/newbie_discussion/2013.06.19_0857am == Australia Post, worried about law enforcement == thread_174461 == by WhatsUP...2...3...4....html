				Hi all,<br />Looking for anyone with knowledge of LE tactics in Australia.<br />I&#039;ve ordered small amounts of weed from SR without hassles many times now.<br /><br />Just ordered from a new vendor (who doesn&#039;t want to reply to my messages about this).<br /><br />Usually I get a sealed envelope with the package inside.<br /><br />This time I got a request to pick up from Australia post. It&#039;s 3.5grams of weed. Seriously, it shouldn&#039;t be parcel size.<br /><br />Wondering if anyone in Australia regularly picks up from AP?<br /><br />Would love some advice.<br /><br />Cheers

				Have they just put a normal come and collect notice in your letter box then? what does it say? unable to deliver? signature required?<br /><br />It is not unheard of for LEO to attempt a CD in AU with this method but 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s just a lazy postie who couldn&#039;t be arsed to leave your mail. However given your order is quite small as you say it should have been packaged in something that could have been left in your mail box ok.<br /><br />Have you contacted the vendor to see if they sent it requiring a signature by mistake? go and find out how the order was packaged etc first, if it was just sent via normal express post you may want to write it off.

				I asked the vendor, but he&#039;s being a real prick and not replying. Might just let this one go and not use that vendor again. There&#039;s no signature required, however I&#039;d have to show ID etc at the post office.<br />Plus I didn&#039;t even mention how late the package was. Ordered last weekend (long weekend), only arrived today. Normally takes 3 business days max. <br />I&#039;ll wait for the vendor to reply, but it smells fishy to me. Sucks balls.

				Just remember LEO are not going to stake out the post office for 3.5g of weed but they may use the CCTV footage of you collecting it as evidence if it is a CD.<br /><br />
