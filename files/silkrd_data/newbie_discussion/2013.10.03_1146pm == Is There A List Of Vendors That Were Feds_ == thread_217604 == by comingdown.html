				Why would feds be undercover vendors? wouldn&#039;t they be undercover, and purchase the drugs rather then try to sell them, and bust people, that wouldn&#039;t make any sense. They have bought drugs, and test purities, but to be a undercover vendor just to bust a couple of H, coke, and potheads who just wanted to buy a couple of grams would be a waste of time, just like taking down SR was a waste of their time.

				I&#039;m sorry to be a dick but it should surely be simple to understand.<br /><br />Man, I was sarcastic (obviously) in my first sentence and I explained in the rest of the reply.<br /><br />Basically, yeah there is no doubt that there are a lot of vendors who are really just fed fucks but who&#039;s to know who they are??<br /><br />It&#039;s impossibly for anyone to say for sure and i&#039;m sure if they nailed someone through this process they wouldn&#039;t be making it public knowledge and give everyone else the heads up.<br /><br /><br />Peace out, <br />Evoc<br /><br />
