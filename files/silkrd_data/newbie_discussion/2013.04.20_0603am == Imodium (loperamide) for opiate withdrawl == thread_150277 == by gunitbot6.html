I also know about the Proglumide remedy as well. Neither &quot;get rid&quot; of op8 withdraws. I can tell you this 1st hand. <br /><br />Either of them may aid the secondary or tertiary symptoms of WD, but that is about it. Just like Clonidine relieves some blood pressure symptoms (chills/goose flesh)...but it does not get rid of op8 WD either. <br /><br />When I was chemically depdent, I always...and I mean ALWAYS kept an emergency kit around for dry spells/droughts/my wierd idea that i was going to get clean/or god knows what else. <br /><br />That kit included:<br /><br />1. Subutex/buprenorphine (methadone tabs if you must)<br />2. Clonodine/Catapres<br />3. Benzos (Xanax/Valium)<br />4. Advil liquid tabs<br />5. Soup/crackers/munchies<br />6. At least 3 days of solitude (no work or annoying girlfriend)<br />

				Loperamide doesn&#039;t get rid of WDs really but it does fix the part I find to be the worst. I have always been on other medications that make my bowels loose so when I went through WDs the first time it was terrible. Honestly I can deal with the aching and sweating and runny nose ect but the shitting is just intolerable for me. That being said I never went cold turkey again. Now if I know or suspect I will be out I set aside a prescribed regime of stepping down and at zero day I start loperamide and apap. Works for me but I&#039;ve never really had a problem giving up addictive substances. I suspect I&#039;m not predisposed to psychological addiction and that&#039;s why it always seemed so easy to me to quit. I feel for others who really struggle though I&#039;ve seen people go through hell with these substances.

				Nahh, just drink spinach puree and eat pounds of habanero chicken. <br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />Besides, nothing fixes horseface like more horse.
