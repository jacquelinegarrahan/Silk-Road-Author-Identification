				I ordered from a new vendor when he only had a few reviews (they were good) but seems he got himself in over his head &amp; couldn&#039;t keep up with the demand.&nbsp; He offered a refund or to wait a week &amp; get a few freebies; I decided to wait. <br />He marked in transit 8 days later but has since disappeared.&nbsp; No response to message, hasn&#039;t been online in several days, no package arrival. We are coming up on resolution time &amp; I&#039;m not sure what to do.&nbsp; If he had acknowledged me like he did the first time I wouldnt have an issue with waiting until he has it available, however now that he hasnt been around I guess I would just like to get my money back so I can order from someone else. <br />I am really disappointed that this will affect my refund rate though.&nbsp; at what rate will vendors not want to deal with a customer? my stats have been good thus far.<br />also I am not sure if the purchase was hedged or not.&nbsp; is there a way to tell this once the order has been placed? If it was not, will I be losing a bit of money off of this refund due to btc value being much lower than when I purchased?<br />any advice on best way to deal with this situation?

				It seems to me the only option you have is to go to resolution and get a refund.&nbsp; I have seen vendors state that they don&#039;t sell to people with 10 percent refund rate or higher without fe.&nbsp; If the item only costed a small amount and you have very few transactions and it will greatly affect your refund rate, then possibly just take the loss and finalize.

You shouldn&#039;t be penalized for a bad vendor. I think you should contact support of you have the time.
