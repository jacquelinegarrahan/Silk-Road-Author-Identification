				Secrets of the Holy Annointing Oil of Exodus<br /><br /><br />Investigating the link between psychoactive monoterpines, diterpines, allylbenzenes, and other aromatic compounds and the &quot;healing&quot;&nbsp; and &quot;entheogenic&quot; properties of the Annointing Oil of Exodus.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Written by DMtryptamine<br /><br />&nbsp;In Exodus chapter 30:22-25, God tells Moses to concoct a sacred “holy anointing oil” of “the finest of spices”, including “flowing (liquid) myrrh”, “sweet-smelling cinnamon”, “fragrant cane” (Calamus or Cannabis depending on translation), “cassia”, and “olive oil”. Use of this oil was seen as almost an initiatory right (ordination) to entering the priesthood, Origionally use of this oil was restricted to priests but later became available to royalty as well.<br /><br />&quot;The Lord said to Moses, “Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of aromatic cane, and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.&quot; (Exodus 30:22-25)<br /><br />There is alot of mystery and secrecy surrounding this mixture of essential oils, Even in the bible &quot;God&quot; specifically prohibited anyone from trying to reproduce the oil, and if one does attempt to reproduce the oil they are threatened with exile.<br /><br />&quot;And you shall say to the people of Israel, ‘This shall be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations. It shall not be poured on the body of an ordinary person, and you shall make no other like it in composition. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you. Whoever compounds any like it or whoever puts any of it on an outsider shall be cut off from his people.’” Exodus 30:31-33<br /><br />So why this staunch warning against the reproduction of this oil, what is so significant about this combination of plants that was held to be so sacred by the early christians. Many scholors believe that the story of Jesus may have predated christian teachings (The bible), and have postulated that perhaps the story of jesus was a gnostic story and not a christian one.<br /><br />So what is Gnosticism and what does it have to do with annointing oil. Gnosticism is a belief that seeks to delve deeper than exoteric christianity by focusing on self discovery and finding ones own enlightenment, the belief that god is within you, not some external force. Unlike exoteric christianity, Gnostic christianity (esoteric in nature) focuses on inducing direct experience with the devine instead of indirectly (through Gospel alone)<br /><br />There is evidence that the gnostic christians participated in an array of conciousness altering techniques and one of these is believed to be hallucinogenic drugs (book: Gnostic Visions)<br />the Gnostics where believed to have ulilized various herbs and fungi in there rituals (psilocybe cubensis, amanita muscaria, and numerous other). If jesus was in fact a Gnostic teacher instead of a Judeo-christian teacher, then perhaps the annointing oil itself was indeed a psychoactive substance used as a method by which to attain Gnosis (knowledge).<br /><br />The gnostics made a distinction between Jesus and the Christ, the gnostics believed in a way that everyone is the son of god once they come to realize it. So jesus was not devine, merely a spiritual teacher or guide. &quot;When you come to know yourselves... you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty. (Thomas-3).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Some scholors who study the gnostic gospels believe that perhaps jesus was in fact a shaman of sorts, or at least had a keen understanding of natural pharmacology. If this is the case, then perhaps it wasnt miracles he was performing, perhaps it was merely science ahead of its time.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chemical Constituents of the Holy Annointing Oil part 1<br />myrrh, the carrier<br /><br />&quot;It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron&#039;s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.&quot; Psalm 133:2<br /><br />Concidering the potency of some psychoactive essential oils (how concentrated they are) it often only takes a few drops on the tounge to illicit psychoactive effects (although it is wise to dilute before ingesting any oil as irritation may occur.) If in fact the quantities of oil where significant enough it is quite possible that the essential oil may enter the mouth while running down ones face. Even if that is not the case, there is ample annectoctal evidence to suggest that some of these oils may be transdermally active (meaning the active compounds can be absorbed through the skin.)<br /><br />&quot;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name&#039;s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. ...&quot; Psalm 23:1-6<br /><br />So what exactly is in this sacred oil, that one is never supposed to reproduce but I plan to anyways? here is what the bible has to say.<br /><br />The Lord said to Moses, “Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of aromatic cane, and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. (30:22-25)<br /><br />Myrrh has a long history of use as a medicine, in aromatherapy, and was concidered sacred by early christians. In fact jesus was offered myrrh to ease his suffering on the cross, which is interesting because myrrh is thought to contains a sesquiterpene (Furanoeudesma-1,3-diene) which has mu-opiod agonist properties (morphine, codeine, hydrocodone, ect are opiod agonists.)<br /><br />The essential oil of Myrrh contains quite an interesting array of compounds as well. The following are chemical constuents of myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) essential oil<br /><br />a-pinene,<br />&nbsp;cadinene<br />&nbsp;limonene<br />cuminaldehyde<br />eugenol<br />m-cresol<br />heerabolene<br />&nbsp;acetic acid<br />formic acid<br /><br />Cuminaldehyde and eugenol are thought to have sedative properties although the effect of ingesting the oil (based on my own experiments) is one of alternating stimulation and sedating/muscle relaxation and I cant seem to find much of an explanation for the stimulant properties and I am not the only one who has reported them.<br /><br />what is perhaps most interesting however is that eugenol increases the skins ability to absorb substances transdermally, and was in fact patented for this reason. This is important as it could increase the absorption of the other plant oils that are used in crafting the holy annointing oil.<br />(http://www.google.com/patents/US4888362)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Part 2<br />The Inhibitor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />the essential oil of cinnamon bark significantly inhibits the enzymes CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139236).<br /><br />This is where it gets interesting, according to 69Rons research on allylbenzenes &quot; <br /><br />&quot;Safrole inhibits the following enzymes according to one source (-5 being strong -1 being weak):<br /><br />CYP1A2 -2<br />CYP2A6 -5<br />CYP2D6 -1<br />CYP2E1 -3<br />CYP3A4 0<br /><br />Another says:<br />CYP1A2 -4<br />CYP2A6 -3<br />CYP2D6 -1<br />CYP2E1 -5<br />CYP3A4 -2<br /><br />It’s primarily metabolized CYP2A6, CYP2C9 and CYP2E1 according to most sources. These all are said to make the inactive 1-hydroxy safrole. Not all sources agree on this information because different tests sometimes show very different enzyme data.<br /><br />Since safrole doesn’t inhibit CYP2C9 and it is inactivated by it, it might not work well as it’s own inhibitor.&quot; (from herbs.maxforums...by: 69Ron)<br /><br />So as we can see, cinnamon oil inhibits two of the three enzymes responsible for converting safrole into the inactive 1-hydroxy safrole, cinnamon oil is one of the oils used in the biblical recipe for crafting the annointing oil.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Allylbenzene oils<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />While the annointing oil is not believed to contain any saffrole, it does contain other allylbenzenes which may work in a similar manner. when one enzyme is inhibited, another enzyme picks up the slack causing these allylbenzenes to be metabolised into different compounds then they would normally be metabolised into. concidering these compounds are already similar in structure to hallucinogens and stimulants and used as a precursor in the synthesis of hallucinogens and stimulants, by altering the metabolism of these compounds perhaps we can force them to be metabolised into psychedelic compounds.<br /><br />Calamus oil contains primarily &quot;alpha-Asarone&quot;... which has a strong resemblance to mescaline.<br />alpha-Asarone is 2,4,5-trimethoxy-1-propenylbenzene<br />Mescaline is 3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenethylamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />It is debated as to whether or not A asarone is active as it is a propylbenzene as opposed to an allylbenzene, and nobody has really ever reported trying to activate this group of aromatic compounds. However there is no reason it couldnt work, and even if it doesent, then there is still b, and g-asarone. g-asarone is an allylbenzene and would likely as such be rendered psychoactive by the enzyme inhibitors, and could possibly act similar to mescaline if sufficient quantities where consumed with the proper inhibitors.<br /><br />Cinnamomum aromaticum (cassia) is also known as chinese cinnamon, Remember there are two types of cinnamon with completely different chemical constituents. There is Cinnamomum verum and Cinnamomum cassia. Cinnamomum verum often has a sweet taste whereas Cinnamomum cassia has a peppery taste. Apperently the bible calls for both types of cinnamon so we must examine them both.<br /><br />Cassia contains the following compounds<br />lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside<br />3,4,5-trimethoxyphenol β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 → 6)-β-D-glucopyranoside<br />(±)-syringaresinol<br />cinnamic aldehyde<br />cinnamyl acetate<br />benzaldehyde<br />linalool<br />chavicol<br />Coumarin (potentially toxic, potentially psychoactive)<br /><br />High doses of pure coumarin can cause headaches, dizziness, lethargy, and stupor,<br />and it is also present in significant quantities in fahan tea (Angraecum fragrans Du Petit-Thouars), which Bibra (1855*) described as being psychoactive.<br /><br />&quot;Coumarin is said to be toxic to the liver and for this reason was banned as a component or<br />ingredient in food. However, the toxicity is very doubtful, and the alleged carcinogenic effects are also questionable&quot; (Marles et al. 1987).<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Conclusion<br />&nbsp;<br />There are numerous psychoactives in the essential oils used to craft the holy annointing oil of exodus, However more research needs to be done in determining whether an allylbenzene is being activated resulting in psychedelic effects. Ultimately the best way to advance this idea further is experiment with the individual oils and the &quot;Annointing Oil&quot; as a whole. So you will be left to ponder this for a while until I can personally test this further.<br /><br />We need to see if there is a sufficient amount of eugenol in the blend to aid the other compounds in transdermal absorption. The activity of many of these compounds is yet to be established as well, leaving many more questions than answers.<br />The point is that it is very possible that jesus, dependant on a number of factors, may have been using this &quot;annointing oil&quot; as an intoxicant, a ritual initiation into gnosis. Maybe I have overstepped my bounds and this has drifted into pure speculation, but I think this warrents further testing.<br /><br />The Annointing oil should definately have some stimulant and perhaps sedative properties, how that will interact is anyones guess. It is too early to reliably say that this oil has psychedelic properties without further testing.<br /><br />To be continued after personal experimentation.

				I think Jesus is a metafour&nbsp; for the Sun(our star that makes life possible here, and in the process sacrificing his fuel), based on Jordan Maxwell&#039;s research. He also claims highly learned catholic insiders, like high level Jesuits, confirmed it to him personally.&nbsp; And when you study it I find more and more and more clues that it is the sun that is being meant. Or God&#039;s son, that he sacrificed for us. Our star that makes life possible here, and in the process sacrificing his fuel. It&#039;s Astro-theology, and it drips off it from all sides you look at it. He gets born when the sun begins to shine more minutes in a day. Other Christian celebrations that are linked to astrological events like equinoxes. <br /><br />Besides that I do believe there are references made to hallucinogenics, and as you say, it was in the time of the shamans more commonly used. But the Christians drug of choice seems to be alcohol, at least that what the masses should use. And we all know what happens to the shamans in areas they conquered and the &quot;witches&quot; in their home continent. Good chance that the inner circle prefer a more enlightening substance, but they don&#039;t want to expand the consciousness of normal people. On the contrary I think. Alcohol is one of the worst, conscious altering substances I know.<br /><br />Maxwell has done 50 year or so of research, and for that research talked to the highest and most respected Priests, Rabbi&#039;s and other scriptologers. And they know, and don&#039;t play silly when someone that obviously knows what he&#039;s talking about asks them about it. Not on TV though. But there is much to it.

				oh hooo that&#039;s good.<br />subbing.<br />I want to see an explosion of &quot;jesus iz real ohmigawd dnt dizz him ull go 2hell!!!!!!&quot;<br />lol.<br />This is a very interesting topic to me really. I&#039;ve always wondered if everyone was massively tripping....<br />Shit I mean I saw jesus on the ceiling one time when I had nitrous oxide at the dentist....so hey, there we go.

				I do not put much stock in the amanita muscaria hypothesis, a whole lot of conjecture though. The allylbenzene hypothesis can be proven pharmacologically.
