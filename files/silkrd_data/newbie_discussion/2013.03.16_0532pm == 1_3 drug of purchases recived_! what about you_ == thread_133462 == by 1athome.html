				I have received 1 out of 3 drug orders over the past two months. I have now been ripped off on 2 ten strips of acid. It was definitely my fault I gave my money before I got the stuff, obviously a huge misplace of trust. I would just like all newbies to know just because a seller has a 100 rating for however long doesn&#039;t mean that you should FE for them, I have and was robbed twice. <br /><br />What is your transaction record? I&#039;m assuming 33% is terrible...

				I know now that it was stupid to FE. The two different venders I used were both top ranking sellers, LucyDrop and TabMonster, I believe they were both considered good vendors by the Avengers at one time or another.

				REcieved my first order of Molly from Ivory a year back. Just a placed another one. Also 2c-b and some acid came in nicely. Just had a one 5/strip gone missing.<br /><br />So that would be 3/4 successful orders.

				PERFECT 100% :) Been here a month, received every package with the best of services. <br /><br />Sorry to hear about your bad experience.<br /><br />1. Patience is key here. <br />2. Do your research even if their feed back on the main is 100%. Read the boards and eventually you will get the feeling of what type of vendor he/she is<br />3. Don&#039;t FE for vendors, especially if you&#039;re new. Control your excitement and find another vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE. There&#039;s plenty of them. Majority of FE&#039;s are the vendors regulars. This is where research comes into play, read the boards, see what others say...While at that gain some stats so you don&#039;t look like a total newb/potential scammer and a lot of times those vendors after looking at your stats (Depending) They won&#039;t ask you to FE.<br />If you still insist you must have it, start small and do a test run with the vendor..That way if he runs you won&#039;t loose much. <br /><br />Good luck next time!

				Sorry to hear but glad Im not alone. Ive placed 6 orders in the last 3 weeks and Ive received 3 and I know 1 is on the way after talking to the vendor. So me too, I got screwed out of 2 orders.&nbsp; Live and Learn.&nbsp; Me definitely finding sr and going thru all the bullshit to finally make the purchase got me excited and i did some researching but obviously NOT enough even after getting messages from the vendors acting all pleasant and shit. Well thats it for me with the FE i dont give a shit what the vendor says cuz now&nbsp; im out a few hundred

				I&#039;ve been ripped off every time I&#039;ve FE&#039;d.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty easy to scam and have a 100 rating if they make you FE. Since it&#039;s Tor, they can just sign up other accounts and recycle Bitcoin to buy from themselves and leave good reviews over and over again. If the recent transactions are mostly good reviews and have impossible delivery times, and a few FE&#039;s and it requires FE they are probably doing this. Silk Road should really consider writing some software that tracks the blockchain to spot Bitcoin recycling through a vendor and then back to their clients.<br /><br />Even if you get scammed a few times, at least it still goes toward your buyer rating. I&#039;ve had 24 transactions so far, and I no longer have the FE for any drug I want.
