				methylone is more soft. you feel up and down all the night. I like, it&#039;s a good product for a zen party. but there is not too much study on the risks or damage it can cause. so, beware.<br /><br />MDMA is MDMA...it&#039;s the best! big trip and then more linear throughout the night. but the down is more hard than methylone.<br /><br />for festival...the two are good. depending the level you want achieve and the atmosphere...&nbsp;

				MDMA is the real deal whereas Methylone is a cheaper knockoff. You should simply buy a little bit of each from the site and c which one you like best.<br /><br />People around me dont really like methylone bcuz they say it has a comedown.<br />(i dont know what that means but to me methylone doesnt really Peak like MDMA)

				I&#039;ve tried both and methylone has a very harsh comedown for me. So harsh the last time that I&#039;m done with it. I&#039;d rather save up for the real stuff instead. I had tried methylone maybe about 5 times or so and the last time I had a very rapid heartbeat that scared me, higher than what would be considered normal for such a substance. Afterwards I feel like complete and utter crap sometimes up until the day after. Just my take on it of course. Everyone is different. My friend would take it quite often to no ill effects ever. So it depends a lot.

				MDMA isn&#039;t supposed to make you trip. You get a high feeling and lots of energy/wanna dance but I never understood the allure of the drug itself, or why so many people waste money on it at festivals. I take acid or mushies at festivals, gets me energized without making me sweat like a hog and reality starts melting in just the right ways :)

				MDMA is a longer, but mellow roll. Methylone is more intense, but only lasts about 2 hours. M1 is waaaaay cheaper though, so that definitely adds to its appeal

				Methylone reminds me of a high dose of ritalin, all stim and no &quot;magic.&quot; MDMA is pure &quot;magic&quot; but has one hell of a hangover, sometimes lasting a week or 2. <br />I grew up on mdma and never came into contact with methylone until recently, I was very disappointed but can see where it would be appealing to some. As others have said, check both out

In fact it actually metablizes into MDA in one part of the trip and that gives you a little more &quot;trippy&quot; effects....
