				So i&#039;ve heard a lot of talk about how you should never FE, but I see a lot of reputable vendors requiring new members to do it. <br /><br />Is this just vendors being scammy, or is it common practice? <br /><br />In other words, should I expect to have to FE for my first few transactions or is that just opening myself up to being scammed?

				No. Don&#039;t finalize early, unless the vendor is established, has 99% rating or above, and is offering you something in return for FE (such as free shipping or 10% off).<br /><br />You can build an order history in a matter of minutes by buying 5 ebooks. There are some good books for sale for less than a USD$1.<br /><br />

				Anyone can create an account, make a purchase and then claim that their shit never arrived, locking the funds up in a dispute, or getting the dealer to re-send the goods in different packaging. This is unlikely to happen if you&#039;re selling mushrooms or a bag of weed to some hippies who can&#039;t score, but is extremely likely if you&#039;re sending gear to junkies who will try to rob you.<br /><br />You&#039;ve got idealists who love the escrow system and you&#039;ve got vendors who are jaded by dealing with scumbags. Dealers who protect themselves from the escrow system won&#039;t get ripped off by customers trying it on and can therefore sell cheaper because they lose less, but they also protect themselves from the rating system and may be tempted to sell shit stuff.<br /><br />New vendors who demand that you finalize early are usually scammers. I prefer to work inside the escrow system even with trusted vendors as those who operate outside it have false ratings. Finalizing early is promoting a type of dishonesty that I actually give a fuck about as a buyer.

				Yes, I agree with awhiteknight. It&#039;s also worth pointing out that there have been a couple of cases of established sellers demanding FE from all buyers over the course of a week and then vanishing with hundreds of thousands of dollars cashed out.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about risk and its analysis.

				the eBook method of getting stats up is a good idea if you really need your transaction count up. Also I reference my eBooks a lot, so I would recommend getting a few packs of books even if you have enough transactions because most of them come out to like $0.50<br /><br />As has been said 1000&#039;s of times on the main forums &quot;Don&#039;t FE if you can&#039;t afford to loose the coins&quot;

				I really don&#039;t like finalizing early.&nbsp; It ruins the entire experience of using SR.&nbsp; With that said, I have done it for the first time just a couple days ago.&nbsp; The vendor had months of rep and not a single bad word said on the forum.&nbsp; As such, I feel confident that the product will arrive.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t think that I&#039;ll do it again in the future if I can help it as I&#039;ve been a nervous wreck ever since I hit the finalize link...

				Yeah plain and simple, do not FE, ever. I mean if you were buying street drugs, would you give Dealer Joe $100+ up front and ask him to deliver you weed? No, thats ridiculous. I think we need to pool together a list of vendors from varying drug markets that do not require FE, ever.

				Never FE!&nbsp; There&#039;s never a need to.&nbsp; Generally you can find a vendor that will accept a n00bie without demanding you to FE, &amp; if you can&#039;t it&#039;s really not worth the gamble in the first place!<br />We never require anyone to FE, we actually request that customers NOT FE because it makes transactions harder to follow, &amp; most people will never go back to change the feedback which doesn&#039;t look good or give any positive info for those who are trying to gather info on a vender by looking at their feedback.<br /><br />NCK

				As long as you do your research, and KNOW after reading on the forums and the review pages on the sellers on the road, you can FE.<br /><br />Butt obviously, that won&#039;t always be the case.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not comfortable doing it, find a different seller.<br /><br />My first buy was an FE, but my second and third weren&#039;t required for it. <br /><br />Just do your research.

				FE? Fuck No! Never have, never will.&nbsp; You think you are doing some vendor a favor by finalizing early? Well you&#039;re not, even if the vendor is a stand up, trustworthy&nbsp; motherfucker with good feedback and all that good shit. If he or she is at the top of their game they&#039;ll have no problem working with in the escrow system. These guys are making mad cash, and fuck yeah that&#039;s great but FE is total bullshit. Even if you don&#039;t get ripped off and everything goes perfect you are still fucking yourself over and every other buyer up here by finalizing early. Think about it. The only reason so many vendors can demand it is cause so many of you lames think you have to do it. The Escrow system is there for good reason, don&#039;t shit all over it and yourself because you are desperate or whatever the hell your problem is. You ain&#039;t doing anyone any favors, least of all yourself.

				i&#039;m pretty sure its a bad idea, even for new users. Just made my account 1.5 weeks ago have already made 4 orders from various categories (and 2 pretty big ones) NO ONE has made me FE even though i&#039;m a new user. And right they did, not to brag but I can be quite a good customer in the future and will certainly finalize the moment I receive the package(and SR starts working, i&#039;m on it as soon as it is though lol!)

				I think you have to look at from the sellers POV.&nbsp; When you are in this business as a seller there are a lot of scumbags out there. If a seller wanted to rip someone off he could send you a package full of nothing. Tracking would show it was delivered. Then what?&nbsp; Buyers and sellers have to be on there toes. Just saying.

				I see no problems with FE as long as the vendor has enough reputation etc. If you ask me, its the buyers fault for getting scammed on a FE order...Any buyer should be able to realize the risk of FE and therefore spend the time to research which vendor to use...As long as you do that you simply WILL NOT be scammed...

				These are my stats as of today Januarty 26th<br /><br />Total transactions: 57<br />Total spent: $18117.19<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 2.87%<br />Member for: 2 months<br /><br />When you first start in SR you have to take a Leap of Faith, you dont know if your product will be good or if the vendor will actually ship your drugs. You have to take a leap of faith, its like when you buy street drugs and you dont know the dealer that well, or if his products are as what he advertises, we had to go through those who at a young age started getting drugs from street dealers.<br />Lucky for me on SR i have never been scammed, I only went to resolution center twice so far, but just to extend due dates because of christmas delays.<br />When i first started,&nbsp; lucky for me i found trusted vendors who i had to FE with, none of them scammed me. There was only 1 order that it never got to me 1g of MDMA, but that was when i first started 2 months ago, and i was like a kid with a new toy with SR, so i ordered a lot of shit from different vendors and sometimes the same stuff, so i got some MDMA, but there was only one package missing of MDMA but i will never know whose package was, because they all were from the same country , haha.<br />Nowdays, im not required to FE by most vendors and we remain in ESCROW , and i even FE sometimes with my favourite vendors even though im not required to do so.<br />My tips for SR are:<br /><br />1. Always stay in ESCROW whenever possible.<br />2. If you find quality vendors STICK with them, you dont want to use a new vendors whose stealth packaging methods are not known for you, they can fuck up bigtime and flag your address forever. Which could lead to packages not arriving to you from your quality vendors!<br />3. Dont trust ANY of the bitcoins threads that have been around the forums lately, because they are all scammers.

				Escrow is an amazing thing, finalizing early to save a few bucks isn&#039;t worth the risk for me. Even if I&#039;ve had 10+ transactions with a vendor.

				If you make the effort to do the proper research before your first purchase anyway, you&#039;ll end up selecting one of the few vendors I wouldn&#039;t have a problem FEing for. And then they won&#039;t even ask you too. <br /><br />Don&#039;t do it, there are plenty of vendors to choose from. Do your research, read reviews, check transaction history.

				i wouldnt even FE on those vendors with 99% good ratings.<br /><br />i just dont pay for stuff until i get it, and that goes for everything i buy, anywhere.. <br />either if its on buying a car, the local supermarket or on here, i give money when i get the stuff i bought. <br /><br />so i only choose vendors that doesnt require FE. a good vendor should never require you to FE.<br /><br />thats my two cents..

				I&#039;d ordered from a vendor several times and the transactions between us had always ran smoothly- while in Escrow. <br /><br />The last order I placed with him I Finalized Early, mainly because I thought he was legit and I felt comfortable doing it. And guess what? I never received the product. Long story short the vendor was banned by support for faking his feedback. <br /><br />Lesson learned, I will never FE again. <br /><br />Another vendor I have had several successful transactions with (while staying in Escrow) has recently stated he requires FE on all orders. Feck that, I&#039;ll take my business else where.<br /><br />Never FE! You&#039;ll end up getting ripped.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My problem with FE is this: A vendor can have 100 feedback over 300 transactions member for a year ect ect.<br />What happens when hes done selling? Wouldnt be hard for him to post some bullshit sales get 100s of orders and just dip. Thats right it has happened. Or at the very least he.she.heshe. sells his account and the new person doesnt give 2 fucks about you.
