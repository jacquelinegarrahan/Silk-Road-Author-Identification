				Hi. Does anybody have personal experience with vendor AmericanPsycho? All his feedback looks good but I cant get a response from him. His profile says he is available during the week regular hours. Right after I placed two orders with him my account got locked up. I think my passphrase got changed but I know I did not change it. Now I cant check the status of my orders and I can&#039;t get a response from him with this account I created to contact support about the other account. If you have any personal experience with him please post. It just seems strange Thanks. :(

				Sorry to break it to you kobebryant0824, but you made the wrong choice.&nbsp; All the reviews of American Psycho are true to their word.&nbsp; Think of AP as an Amazon vendor, who usually doesn&#039;t reply to messages, and who&#039;s shipping sometimes takes a week, but there are extras thrown in when it arrives.&nbsp; 5/5

All these newbies were stressing and basically making AP look bad on his review forum when I told them to have patience. I&#039;ve become close to AP and tried my best to tell people who doubted AP to just relax. Kobe, my friend...if you had the real confidence and patience of the THE REAL KOBE BRYANT...you would&#039;ve been rewarded with not only bomb product but extras. That&#039;s a bummer you canceled but AP is a nice enough guy that if you reordered he&#039;d gladly send you the original order and more. I&#039;ve been in touch with AP the last couple days and he had a huge influx of orders along with having to restock, pack up every order, drive to different mailboxes, pay for shipping, etc. AP doesn&#039;t have any bench players ready to go like most of the big wigs around here yet he still maintains integrity and will never screw over ANYONE. You do have to realize that he is only human and sometimes things in life happen that you don&#039;t expect...you think if he had a family member pass away or something he would think &quot;Oh I better go on SR and inform everyone right away!&quot; No. It doesn&#039;t work that way. I can see it&#039;s quite apparent why some customers go to AP based on their anxious behavior...but seriously...find another vendor with the product quality, AMAZING reputation, stealth, and usual shipping times and tell me their names...LOL. They&#039;re wont be any!!! So just breathe...AP will take care of you and I&#039;m sure for those of you who weren&#039;t so demanding and anxious and didn&#039;t cancel, we extremely pleased such as Scott&#039;s experience below. <br /><br />LONG LIVE AP.

				Haha OK Scott. Dude just post a bunch of random things to get up to 50. But, if you&#039;d like to write something regarding AP, I&#039;d be happy to copy and paste it in his forum quoting you. Just let me know bro....I&#039;m glad you got you&#039;re product and are happy with AP (it&#039;s sort of hard not to be lol). Just let me know about the post. Peace brother.
