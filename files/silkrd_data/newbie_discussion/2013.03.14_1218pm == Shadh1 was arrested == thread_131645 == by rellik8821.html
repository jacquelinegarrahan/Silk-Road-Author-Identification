				I personally am not one that would do international orders especially from a recievers standpoint. All togethor I was skeptical of recieving anything but I now see that it is very real.<br />I wonder how he was arrested, did he recieve shipments to his own actual adress? how much cocaine/mdma? these all factor in when/if i recieve internationally and if you were too. But sometimes you put yourself in his shoes- and if the money was good, then why would i stop?

				I wouldn&#039;t deal with abroad unless it was a small purchase that wasn&#039;t able to be found domestically.&nbsp; Do you know how he got picked up?&nbsp; Did they find the first random package or was his name already on the list?&nbsp; Either way, it sounds like he took possession of the package in front of authorities.&nbsp; At least from what I heard.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				? how do you know this handle got busted?<br />The second part is that, the down fall of the road will be buyers getting busted by LE selling to them overtime building a case on multiple purchases and then throwing the book of every charge under the sun that they can think of. It sucks but they will turn the buyers into CI&#039;s and start to try to build cases against vendors.<br />I hope not cause I want to get a little run in with some fine OGirls for the road...<br />my2cents

				this is old news. as far as i know: he got busted because he sold out of his house. also gave away his handy number. also ordered a lot to his home. some orders didnt came in (probably confiscated) and he kept ordering big quantities. there is any possible way to do it worse. this was his own fault and nobody elses. but im not surprised the feds say they did a great job catching a fish.<br /><br />anyway thats just what i read about him. maybe not even true i dont know.
