				Hey folks! Quick question...My vendor stated that PGP isnt necesarry on the buyers end. After I put a product in the cart and goto checkout, under the TOTAL is a box where I must put a shipping address. Now from reading the &quot;BUYERS GUIDE&quot; SR says that it is totally anonymous for this box. Is it ok to put a shipping address in this box or is PGP code supposed to go in there im confused....Thanks 4 any help :)

				To be safe, most put their address in PGP as well. If your vendor doesn&#039;t require it though, go for it. I just wouldn&#039;t advise making a habit out of it.

				For your own safety, take the time to learn PGP; you can&#039;t be too careful, especially if you are buying large amounts ;) Then, encrypt your address on the PGP application, using the vendor&#039;s public key and copy and paste the message to the address box so the vendor can decrypt it on their end :)

				You really should be encrypting no matter what the vendor&#039;s requirements are. It&#039;s literally an extra 30 seconds of work.

				As stated, you should encrypt your address.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not necessary.&nbsp; In fact, it&#039;s already encrypted by Tor -- this is NOT true of anything outside of Silk Road though (that&#039;s an oversimplification, but whatever).&nbsp; The reason to encrypt is so that you&#039;re protected from anyone who has access to the server looking at the address; nobody can intercept the address on the way or anything though whether you encrypt it or not.

				Yup.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna have to agree with encrypting your address at least.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure SR has an encryption set up so it automatically encrypts in anyway.&nbsp; But either way, a second encryption is quite secure in my book.

				Never used PGP on over 20 deliveries. <br />Don&#039;t need to be ultra paranoid. You are not planning a revolution or an assassination. <br />If your computer or the dealer&#039;s computer is bugged PGP will not make the slightest difference.<br />

				^^^^ I don&#039;t need to imagine a trojan or think they will be monitoring your screen on a live feed with a human behind it, this is somewhat unrealistic.v<br /><br />I am no expert but from my experience with the little crappy info I know, it is very easy to plant a keyloger or to record someone&#039;s screen. Now if a lame guy like me can do this. Imagine the software available to someone with resources and knowledge.<br /><br />
