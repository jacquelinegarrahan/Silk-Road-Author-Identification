				So I&#039;ve been able to piece together random things and how to do them on here, but I don&#039;t feel comfortable at all with it. Would someone be willing to PM with me so I don&#039;t feel annoying on this forum? And so I don&#039;t have to post for days to find answers? I would really appreciate it! :D

				I kinda have the encrypt/decrypt down, and the basic idea of how to do things. Basically worried about where to get BTC and the best way to do so. Like I see people talk a lot about going to the bank and filling something out for them but I haven&#039;t understood what they&#039;re doing there. Like what&#039;s the best way to get BTC? And what &quot;Wallets&quot; to use? It&#039;s like I have read enough about it all, but it&#039;s all still jumbled up and I don&#039;t know where to begin. I downloaded &quot;Electrum&quot; which is a desktop wallet I guess, and also downloaded &quot;gpg4usb&quot;. Also, is a special email necessary? One like tormail that doesn&#039;t release info? I found a Russian one &quot;mail.day.az&quot; that I want to sign up for, but I still don&#039;t know the purpose for making an email like that either, I just have read a lot about them. I know I&#039;m all over the place in this post, but that&#039;s exactly why I&#039;m calling out to you guys haha. Help sort me out please :D<br /><br />Newb status &gt;__&lt;

First, they charged a flat fee of 1.5% (which I believe was reduced to 0.5%), and when you sent the coins to your anonymous address, the fee would be subtracted, and the rest would be deposited to your real bitcoin address in exactly two transactions, within about 10 minutes. So if someone identifies your SR address as belonging to SR and they see the deposit came from another address, which they suspect belongs to blockchain.info, because the coins in that address came from two transactions a few minutes apart, then they merely have to look in the block chain for a transaction that occurred about 10 minutes earlier and involved exactly 1.5% (or 0.5%) more BTC. Now they are on the other side of the mixer and they can follow the transaction chain back to the exchange and your identity.<br /><br />There are much better mixing services that give you more options for how you deposit and withdraw your coins, along with charging variable rate fees, to defend against that kind of traffic analysis.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
