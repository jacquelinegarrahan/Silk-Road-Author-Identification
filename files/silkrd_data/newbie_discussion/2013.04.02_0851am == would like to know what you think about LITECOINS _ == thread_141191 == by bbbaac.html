				I don&#039;t know much about them to be honest, but I bought some of them the other day. I invested in them based on the fact that the value of the bitcoin has increased by about 20 times the value they were when I first started using SR. I am going to hoard the litecoin for now and if they become valuable in the future, I will sell them at a profit :)<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to hear what other people&#039;s opinion of them is...<br /><br />

The last Bitcoin will be mined in 2015 so they have a slightly longer shelf life but I don&#039;t see Litecoin as the replacement cryptocurrency to it as it offers little over the Bitcoin itself - having said that I have spoken with several investors who have done well for themselves trading on the LTC stock exchange.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would suggest doing this as you can invest indirectly in mining in this way without any messy business involving unwieldy computers cluttering up your bedroom. :-)<br /><br />V.
