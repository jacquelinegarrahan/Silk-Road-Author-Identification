				First of all, I&#039;m not all that &quot;into&quot; drugs - I have a chronic pain issue - a real one and Dr. incompetence and some good friends led me here so I could get opioids. But, I think that I treat my pain easier and cheaper with something like edible pot brownies. I&#039;ve never tried it so could someone recommend something good for a first timer that would make sense?

				Well, if you&#039;ve never been high on cannabis and you start on medical grade cannabis then there is a good chance that you will not like it and will not continue to use it.&nbsp; Maybe like a half a hit of med grade.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t suggest you start on a medical brownie.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be intensely overwhelming for you because you have never been high where as it is just a normal state of relaxation and happiness for a smoker.<br /><br />I remember my first time getting high on cannabis many decades ago on some red haired weed from Vietnam that we called &quot;red bull&quot; and it was very overwhelming to say the least.

				Hello,<br /><br />I think pot is really good for pain.<br />I Think Green Crack or Super Silver Haze are energizing highs so you can use it on day without feeling tired (it is Sativa). Indica is better for helping you sleeping. <br />You can find medicinal reviews about different kinds of weed here:<br />http://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-crack

				Don&#039;t eat an edible your first time, it&#039;s like a trip in the sense that when you take it you are on for the ride, no getting off.<br /><br />I&#039;d smoke because you can say, &quot;i&#039;m done smoking, i&#039;m high enough&quot; when you&#039;re confortably high without being overwhelmed.

				I would suggest vaporizing an indica...not much at all, just one tap of it, that is much more effective than eating heavy brownies and chancing on them being doses heavier than you anticipate.&nbsp; You can control what you inhale much more than what you digest.<br /><br />Good luck, weed is a lovely thing so I hope you will embrace it when you try.<br /><br />Peace and love and good things

				i cant remember how many mg an entire one is im sure it will say on the label. your going to hafta eyeball it but either dont eat enough OR eat WAAAAAAY to much so you just fall asleep and wake up rested and starving prob thirsty make sure you go to bed with a bottle of water lol you might be to lazy to WANT to move of course only if you go the way to much route say at night during a pain attack eat the whole chew drink a bottle of water youll pass out and wake up starving and rested! i did it the other day with that popcorn i told you about! lol 25mg prob perfect for morning when you wake up BEFORE breakfast because youll just get hungry again! and youll be pain free most of the day prob the whole day for a newb! oh and half im assuming might even make you pass out i always underestimate how strong concentrates can potentialy be for a person.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;have you done anything besides alcohol?

				cthatpatrnovathr I think overestimating the power of the dosing is going to be key for me I have never, ever, in my entire life tried cannabis! So I have no idea how what will affect me so the less I consume the first, second and third time and the slower I consume it the better. Thanks for the tip about the water. That makes A LOT of sense. <br /><br />I can&#039;t do alcohol because it have a lot wrong with my liver, pancreas and sometimes kidneys. SO I haven&#039;t even really tried that.<br /><br />I do take Percocets right now my family is being difficult and trying to get me down to one 5mg of oxy per&nbsp; day which, is SO stupid. My pain is much greater than that - so I&#039;m taking a backdoor cannabis/ordering pills myself route to dealing with all of this.

I&#039;ll let my pain hit a 6-8 before I even consider pain meds 8-10 is time for the emergency room.

				Wow this brings me back, my first time I got really high and it was a little uncomfortable (I still enjoyed it) so I would suggest taking small hits from a piece to get your feet in the water. If you are in a group don&#039;t try to keep up, I had a friend who tried to keep up with me and my other buddy (daily tokers) and he got way too high. He never touched weed again lol.<br /><br />Pro tip: Only non-smokers, cops, and the 70s generation call it pot these days. If you don&#039;t fall into any of those categories, try to diversify your slang (don&#039;t over do it though). Weed and bud would be my recommendation.

				Going to second (or rather 9th or 10th) the advice of buying some lower grade stuff and smoking it in small doses the first few times before starting on edibles. <br /><br />Edibles kick arse, but as stated once you eat it, there isn&#039;t any going back.

				Cheers O.P. for giving cannabis a try. Sounds like it would be greatly beneficial to you, and help relieve some pain. I can also concur with those who&#039;ve recommended chronicconfections. The popcorn was awesome b/c it&#039;s broken up in tiny pieces so you can consume however much you want. I&#039;ve also tried their rice krispie treats as well, and it was intense, off just 1/2 the treat. So yeah definitely be careful with dosing. I&#039;ve found that once most people get thru the intro stage of confusion with weed not knowing what you&#039;re doing..then things get easier. In general, smoking will be a quicker high, not lasting as long. Whereas edibles will generally take a little longer to kick in, be more mellow, &amp; they will be longer-lasting.

				iamglover, vaporizing may be an option for you where you are worried about your room mate.&nbsp; It cuts down on the smell alot, but not completely, but its way less than with smoking or cooking.&nbsp; You can use a sploof (just take a discarded toilet paper roll and stuff with dryer sheets, blow the vapor through it) to cut down on smell significantly.&nbsp; You can buy a vaporizer that is sold for aromatherapy, and if anyone asks, there&#039;s your alibi&nbsp; :D Hope that helps as the medical nug definitely helps a lot of people, and should never be frowned upon by anyone.
