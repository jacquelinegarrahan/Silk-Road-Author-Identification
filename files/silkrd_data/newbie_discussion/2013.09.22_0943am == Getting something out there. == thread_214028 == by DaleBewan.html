				Okay, so after reading SugarLeafs links, I will definitely not be selling my book on Silk Road. (thanks SugarLeaf).<br />That does however still leave the original question - is there anywhere I can talk about it that Silk Road users might see it?<br /><br />Perhaps if I might be so bold, that could even be a separate forum (so those that aren&#039;t interested in seeing that kind of promotion don&#039;t have to) - a place specifically for people to promote things outside of Silk Road that are of possible interest to some Silk Road users.<br />Any thoughts from others on this?

				Reddit would probably be a good venue. <br /><br />reddit.com/r/silkroad<br />reddit.com/r/drugs<br /><br />Check the side bars for even more drug and psychedelics related subreddits.

				Best of luck to you. I agree though that it probably would not be worth advertising through SR. You could always try other drug-related forums such as Opiophile, there are lots of SR users there. Also that forum has entire sections on LSD, hallucinogens and self-discovery. Look me up there if you decide to join, my sn is gnossos.

				VicFontaine: Thanks for the reddit idea - I&#039;ve received some very positive feedback there, and there seems to be genuine strong interest in my book.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t think of it.&nbsp; Hat&#039;s off to you!<br /><br />gn0ssos: I hadn&#039;t heard of Opiophile, but just checked and it says &quot;Registrations are currently closed, however we do have open registration every couple months.&quot;, so looks like I can&#039;t sign up without paying (which I&#039;m not really willing to do, since I&#039;m already an active member on other fora).
