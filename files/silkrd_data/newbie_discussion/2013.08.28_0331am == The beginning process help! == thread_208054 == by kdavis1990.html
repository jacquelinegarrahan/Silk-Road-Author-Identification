				Ok guys, I had learned of the Silk Road from a buddy of mine. So, I&#039;m at the beginning of the whole process of getting verified at mtgox for bitcoins. Is there any better suggested sites for bitcoins? But anyways this is what i&#039;m going with for now, and after that Tuesday i&#039;m ready to place my order when i get paid. So should i be as scared as i am to do this? What are the chances of getting caught? Do people get caught often? And do high ranking vendors every scam? So i&#039;m going to do a first time order, Do any of you have any suggestions or tips to help me on my journey? Much would be appreciated! It&#039;s been such a hassle to get the coins, Also is there any more of a simple way? TY MUCH&nbsp; ! &lt;3 and happy hunting

				Ok what country are you in as that makes a differance to buy coins Americans seem to love localbitcoins but in Aus thats shit cause everyones lazy <br />Next look around at all the vendors read the feedback not just the ratings alot you will find 5/5 never arrived etc so read the comments too <br />When you have found a vendor that you like and seems legit search the forums remember it will only search the page your on so go to the start and search from there <br />Then if still happy msg vendor politely stating this is your first purchase blah blah blah would you mind doing buisness with me they might say yes or no they might say yes but you need to FE if they say this start again there are plenty of vendors that wont make you FE <br />Learn pgp it greatly lowers the risk and order domestic at first to get used to the whole thing

				LE will be able to look at your bank account and figure out that you&#039;ve purchased bitcoins, but it&#039;s not illegal to purchase bitcoins.<br /><br />They won&#039;t be able to show that you&#039;ve deposited them to SR because SR &quot;tumbles&quot; coins on the way in.<br /><br />If LE asks why you bought bitcoins you can say you wanted to donate to a cause/website that accepts bitcoin donations, or you lost a bet to an online friend and paid him in bitcoins or whatever.<br /><br />If they somehow know you deposited bitcoins to an SR account, you can say you just dumped to SR and out to a wallet again to make use of the tumbler.
