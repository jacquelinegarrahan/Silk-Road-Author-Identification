				I heard about this wonderland a while ago, but it took some time to check it out for myself. I&#039;m eager to try it out but I have some concerns. Do most users just get products shipped to their home address?

				I think a mod should answer the question, because people on this place can give you false info,so if its not verified, don&#039;t listen.&nbsp; This place could be a myth.

Don&#039;t use a PO box or a fake address or a fake name or any of that. That&#039;s gonna get you fucked up the ass hard by the feds. Escrow basically means that the silk road has your money once you buy something. If you got sold bunk you can tell the silk road that and they&#039;ll talk to you or something. I don&#039;t know. The few times I got bunk shit it was a small amount and I just let it go. You shouldn&#039;t get fake stuff if you read the reviews and ask around the rumor mill. I generally would never buy large quantities of any drug until I&#039;ve bought a small amount and tried it for myself. You might even want to get your drugs tested if you think there&#039;s a good chance it could not be what you think it is.

				I had the same trepidation when I first stumbled upon the road. At first I thought about a vacant house down the street. Sent a bogus birthday card there and checked it walking my dog the next few nights and it never got there. So, apparently the PO knows that no one lives there so it probably got returned to the sender&#039;s address (which I got from the local phone book). I can&#039;t imagine what those folks thought when they had it returned to them, lol. Then, I finally grew a pair and said &quot;fuck it&quot;. I made my first small purchase (2 pill order) and sent it to my address with my name. So far, I&#039;m up to 6 successful orders without issue. Use your real name and address. If I&#039;m ever expecting something and I get asked to sign for it, not doing it. That&#039;s a tell-tale sign of a controlled delivery. I get my parcels out of the mailbox and let them sit for a day before opening just in case there&#039;s a knock on my door. It&#039;s all about plausible deniability. Just be smart and cautious and you&#039;ll be fine. Research potential vendors and when you find a good one stick with them for your substance of choice. That&#039;s my advice. As far as bunk shit goes, I don&#039;t know. Have not had that problem yet. Nothing but excellent quality and killer stealth so far. Good luck on taking your first step onto the road.

				Hey, OP, I&#039;m new too.&nbsp; Yeah, it&#039;s scary.&nbsp; But I really think, the more I read about this, that buzzo is right, that small amounts aren&#039;t really up the police&#039;s alley, and the stuff you&#039;re going to receive is meant to look just like regular old mail.&nbsp; Although I haven&#039;t actually pulled the trigger yet on a purchase, so I guess it looks like I&#039;m just talky talky.&nbsp; But I think tonight is the night!&nbsp; I&#039;m so excited and I just can&#039;t hide it ... I&#039;m about to lose control and I think I like it!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I used my home address but only for LSD because that&#039;s easily concealed.&nbsp; Just got my first shipment today and it was stealth as fuck.&nbsp; For any powders or pills, though, I&#039;m going to set up a PO box.&nbsp; And as buzzo said, it&#039;s all about plausible dependability.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever sign for something because it says you are accepting responsibility.&nbsp; Someone put it well somewhere else on these forums.&nbsp; You&#039;re vengeful ex could send drugs to your house to get you in trouble.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not your fault if drugs show up to your house and you happen to open it ;)&nbsp; Just don&#039;t use a fake name, that implies you were expecting something for John Dover and opening it means you were expecting it.&nbsp; And don&#039;t sign for anything.&nbsp; You should be good especially if you&#039;re only buying for recreational use.

				first of all, welcome. i am also new and i am loving this place. <br /><br />i think if you are ordering small quantities of drugs to your door then i think it is safe to say LE would not bother you as they do not have the time nor the resources to go after every single person who could possibly be ordering drugs. with small amounts, i agree with others in that you should order to your home address. after all anyone can send you something illegal in the mail and its not the receivers responsibility (unless they can prove that you bought it, tough ask when your using tor and encryption etc). <br /><br />having said that, dont be complacent or lazy with your security. always stay safe and be cautious, no need to give anyone an incentive to come after you.&nbsp;

				I would only use real name and home address for domestic orders or for tabs that are easily concealed. For international, its fake address/name, bit more of a hassle and increases the risk of loss but better than getting busted IMHO Anyway, LE will generally seize small orders but repeated seizures would lead to a visit.

				I&#039;ve used my home address before now as-well as various drops. Not had a problem thus far.<br /><br />The escrow system is in place to protect you.<br />You pay for the goods and the money is held in &#039;escrow&#039;. ie. It&#039;s neither in your wallet nor the vendor&#039;s wallet.<br />When you receive your goods and are happy, you finalize and the funds are released to the vendor. <br /><br />Finalizing early, or &#039;FE&#039; for short, is when you release funds before receiving your goods. Some vendors ask for this for various reasons, especially from new members. There are vendors who won&#039;t ask for it though. Be aware though, if you do FE and you get ripped off, SR will NOT be able to help you.<br /><br />General rule of thumb - remain in escrow. It&#039;s for your protection. <br />

				Welcome to the forums and to SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly new too and waiting on my first order to be delivered.&nbsp; Hell, this site still could be a giant scam/myth where I get a rick roll in the mail.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />I had nerves bad but of course this place is here for a reason.&nbsp; The more info you read about the less concerned you&#039;ll be.
