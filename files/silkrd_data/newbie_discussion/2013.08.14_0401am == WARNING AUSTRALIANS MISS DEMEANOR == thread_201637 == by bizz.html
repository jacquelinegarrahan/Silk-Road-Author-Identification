				Usually when a vendor has been on SR for over a year and has 100% positive feedback there is a darn good reason for it.&nbsp; My bet is that MD will come through.&nbsp; Yes, everyone has a right to call someone a scammer, but that doesn&#039;t mean that it is the polite or friendly thing to do.&nbsp; Same with sharing personal messages- sure, you have the right.&nbsp; But if you lose a great supplier as a result, was it really worth it?

				Everyone keeps saying nobody has received their package have you actually went back and looked multiple people have received their packages every day. It takes 6-10 days that is the post office quotes and 3-4 for shipping do the math. Most of the orders are from the last week. I do care for my customers and I will continue to offer my services to them but I will no longer take any new customers. Simple fix to a problem that never existed.

				Two weeks is the shorter end of the scale with up to 28 days for turn around from USA. It&#039;s not on a direct flight path to Australia and will have to route through a few countries first. I&#039;ve waited for Ebay items with tracking that have taken over three weeks. Stop getting your panties in a twist, If time was/is your concern order from some one willing to do express shipped or simply go local, alternatively you could just sit back and wait without making your selves look like children in a candy store.

				Only new here on the forum.<br />Been on Silk Road for about 8 month now.<br />I think Miss Demenor is on the up and up, people have been getting their packages around 14 - 16 days.<br />We placed an order for 1g it&#039;s been 7 days today. When I receive it first thing I&#039;ll do is make a post here, to let the others know.<br />I think we should all do that instead of just making accusations based on what it looks like.<br />Either way we will know soon enough where we stand. If anything I would have lost $100 but maybe we might just have found a good seller.<br />And there hasn&#039;t been a good seller for Australia since Kush411 stopped shipping here.<br />Also sad and disappointed at how DubG went down hill. :o

				Hiya Guys. Yesterday I received my 2nd package from Miss Demeanor she is not a scammer. <br /><br />For anyone who was there when MD first began shipping almost exclusively to OZ I foolishly after waiting only a week was the first to call her a scammer (SR Acc: Forsaknlife). Swarms of scammer posts ensued and MD took down her page saying she could not deal with these people hurting her reputation and profits etc. MD cancelled my Escrow order for 1 gram and told me that when ever the package arrived it was mine to keep and Free. She was apparently done with SR. Low and behold I received my package and was impressed by all 3 attributes (Speed, Stealth, Product). I was so amazed that I messaged her and thanked her. I even put in another order not 1 day later. 15 days later (Paid for the slow shipping) I received my 2nd package, Just as great stealth and product. <br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t want to jump the gun as I have done in the past. I honestly think MD will come through for everyone. She is a good vendor and she won&#039;t stick around again if people have nothing but stupid and incorrect information and want to spread it. <br /><br />Regards<br />Forsaknlife

				OK here&#039;s my two cents.<br />Order of 1g <br />28 days later I have received nothing at all.<br />Not receiving any messages.<br />So now I have to assume the worse.<br />Yeh it sux to get ripped off, worse part is the wait, day after day, hoping something will happen. <br />I now lost prety much all my funds to DubG and than to Miss Demeanor.<br />I strongly advise all aussies out there to stay clear of Miss Demeanor and any other overseas vendor who makes big promises and asks you to FE and trust them.<br />I&#039;m never going to FE again thats for sure.<br />all the best you guys hope you all find a vendor with integrity out there.&nbsp; :-[ :&#039;( ::)
