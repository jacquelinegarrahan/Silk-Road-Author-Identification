				Hey guys, <br /><br />In April I received some Psilocybe cyanescens from seller cyanspore (very fast delivery), it was 6 gram, in an air tight silver envelope, I didn&#039;t have any plans on using it so I put it in the freezer and there it stayed until now.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping on going to a lake house next week with some friends and we were going to take this with us but to be honest, I don&#039;t really know how to use it!&nbsp; I&#039;ve done shrooms before, I&#039;m just not sure about the DELIVERY method, I mean, it&#039;s just an envelope with powder in it! do I weigh it before hand? put it in a bottle? a glass?&nbsp; &nbsp;how do I distribute it? Cyanspore said you only need 1 gram per person because it&#039;s very potent, is that true?<br /><br />Any tips on how to divide it and consume it? should I bring a scale with me?&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this stuff even good 4 months later??&nbsp; (it was kept in a vacuum sealed envelope in the freezer the entire time.<br /><br />Your help is appreciated<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Ok, I read some more about it.. is the best way to simply measure out one gram with a scale and them dump it in a glass of water?

				there are lots of ways to consume dried mushrooms. my favorites are probably putting the powder in melted chocolate (good for storing, too) and just mixing the powder with OJ (warning: can be a little strange looking). you can also just eat it straight, but i can see how a bunch of dry mushroom powder would be unpleasant. to avoid the taste, you can put it in gelcaps and swallow it that way (parachuting would also work if you can swallow that much volume at once). as long as it gets into your stomach, it will be effective. basically the thing you have to keep in mind is to not get it too hot. the actives start to degrade around 250F from what i understand (there is some debate about this). most would advise you not to cook with it, but there are probably some people who have done it and would say it works just fine.<br /><br />even with that said, a lot of people make mushroom tea by pouring boiling water over the powder, letting it sit for a while, and straining out the matter (you can eat it afterwords, and i find it to be relatively tasteless after having been steeped). throw in some of your favorite tea bags and some honey, and you&#039;ve got a delicious pot of mushroom tea! this might be a good way for you and your friends since you can just divide a pot of liquid into 6 equal cups for a 1g per dose. i have tried 1g from cyanspore, and I agree that it&#039;s a good place to start for a beginner. i&#039;d say it&#039;s a little bit weaker than he claims though, but i&#039;ve only bought it once. i&#039;d compare it to about 1.5g of cubensis, but i guess if you haven&#039;t taken mushrooms before that wouldn&#039;t mean anything to you.<br /><br />hope that&#039;s helpful. have fun! don&#039;t eat too much.

				Just get it into your stomach one way or another, but don&#039;t heat it over 150 C (300F) or you&#039;ll destroy the psylocibine. <br /><br />Also, make sure your stomach is empty when you take them.

				Thanks for the reply guys, I&#039;m not looking into doing anything fancy (like chocolate or tea), and I don&#039;t care about the taste. I just want to get them into my stomach. So can I just dump the 6 grams I have into a tall glass of water and then pour that into 6 other glasses? or will the mushrooms not mix with the water and I&#039;ll end up just having 1 glass with 6 grams and 5 glasses with just water?<br /><br />

				Well common sense seems to tell me to just put a G in each of the 6 glasses and not worry about mixing it all with an even bigger glass. You&#039;re making it way to complicated, bro

				well, you could have asked me<br /><br />first of all, a freezer isn&#039;t the best place to store because that can introduce moisture, although it&#039;s unlikely if it&#039;s kept in the sealed bag and it&#039;s already dried. Just keep it in a dark dry place is good enough<br /><br />if you don&#039;t have a scale, 1 gram = 1 teaspoon level<br /><br />you should just start with 1 gram or less if it&#039;s your first time. keep the other 5 grams in the same plastic bag, but NOT in the refrigerator/freezer, just in a dark dry place like a drawer. Keeping them dry is the most important. Even if the vacuum seal is broken, they will still last at least a month with little potency loss<br /><br />as for the powder, you can mix it with anything. Orange juice seems to be popular, but milkshakes, any liquid or even food. Mix it with hot tea or coffee or cocoa and it will hit you a little faster
