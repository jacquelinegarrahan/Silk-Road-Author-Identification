				Hi Everyone.<br /><br />This is a first time a package did not arrive at my friends house. <br />Should I be worried that it may of been intercepted and the mail address is now flagged?&nbsp; (it was just 1gram of weed)<br /><br />What is a great method I could use to determine whether or no the address is flagged?<br />I was thinking I could vacSeal some grass/leaf clippings and mail it to myself or maybe some baking soda/flour into a small baggy and mail it to myself.<br /><br />Someone tell me some good tips if any one has been in this situation

				Easy ! <br /><br />Ask the vendor for the shipping records .<br />It will say when and if it made it.<br /><br />All vendors track deliveries.&nbsp; Just ask.&nbsp; A g of weed?&nbsp; Wow!<br /><br />Also . I found that typo on the address is responsible for most of lost packs .

				I would relax and be calm. I would not suggest mailing a decoy to yourself... not even sure what that would do. What do the forums say about the seller recently?
