				I am new to SR. Haven&#039;t made any orders and am looking to get some super chronic, but still a bit skeptical about everything. Does anyone know of a vendor that is willing to work with newbs and sell like 1g or something just so i know it&#039;s legit? I have friends that have purchased H on here before and have been very pleased with everything. I am looking for the same type of respect in the mmj business.<br /><br />Obviously i want the best mmj or equivalent i can find. I&#039;m in the US. Any advice is appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,

				I&#039;m just trying to be cautious man. Like i said, I&#039;m new and trying to learn the ways of SR. I understand paying $30 for a g isn&#039;t worth it. I&#039;m just trying to get my foot in the door with a good vendor and don&#039;t want to get ripped off.<br /><br />Am i going about this in the wrong way? Do you have a vendor to suggest? Any other advice?

				I am awaiting to be proven wrong but I ain&#039;t buying bud off of here unless it&#039;s in bulk because I still have yet to wrap around my head why a gram would go for thirty fucking bucks and I wouldn&#039;t want to buy a gram for 30 bucks anyways because what if it&#039;s weak shit you know?<br /><br />I&#039;m honestly just thinking about sticking to edibles, hash, and oil on here. Maybe shake. Maybe.

				Awesome, thanks for the suggestions. I&#039;m thinking about talking to ogbryan too. <br /><br />So are these guys creative with their shipping? I&#039;m not sure where to have it shipped. Debating on whether to just ship it right to my house or not. I mean obviously i don&#039;t want to sign for anything right? Shit is normally vac sealed an stuff, maybe at least some attempt to hide it?

				don&#039;t bother ordering a gram if eventually you&#039;ll order more...just do your research on the forums and buy from a long time vendor with perfect stats.....that&#039;s how you do it. then you will be set and get good prices like 2xx for an OZ of some good indoor bud.
