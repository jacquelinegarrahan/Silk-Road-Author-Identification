				I placed an order two days ago and want to know how long I should wait before I do something about it. And if I do decide to cancel the order how can I if I can at all? It&#039;s still being processed. The vendor said it would go out today and hopefully it will be fine. But if it doesn&#039;t I&#039;d like to cancel the order. Any advice is much appreciated thanks Bigtruck

				Pretty sure only the vendor can cancel. If I were you I would just be patient and wait it out. Don&#039;t FE and if they ask just politely ask them to cancel the order.<br /><br />Patience is key&nbsp; ;)
