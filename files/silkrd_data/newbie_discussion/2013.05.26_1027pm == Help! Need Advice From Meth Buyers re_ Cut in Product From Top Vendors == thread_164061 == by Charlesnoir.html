				Hi, <br /><br />I had wanted to post this in the &#039;Meth Vendor Review&#039; thread, but cannot as a newb.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have purchased 4qty 3.5 gr and 1qty 7.0gr batches from three top-rated vendors in the last three months.<br /><br />From one vendor, I have no complaints.&nbsp; The gear from the other two, while highly touted as excellent in their reviews, left me very concerned.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have finalized and left 5-star reviews for every transaction, but I am hesitant to do so with this last shipment.&nbsp; <br />It is so highly cut that it was making me ill (headaches, fatigue, stomach issues).&nbsp; I swear there was the old baby lax cut in it, or is partially ISO.&nbsp; I have washed it and have managed to salvage some that is acceptable but I am at a loss as to what to do with finalization.&nbsp; <br /><br />I want to say something to the vendor, but what exactly?&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone else had this experience?&nbsp; Please Respond!<br /><br />Thanks!
