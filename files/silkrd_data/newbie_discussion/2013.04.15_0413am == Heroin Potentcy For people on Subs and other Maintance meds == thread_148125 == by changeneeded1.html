				So ive been a user for 8 years now and ive so far only tried Minigurus , Charlie must thrive and stealth Rx on the Silk road. I was shocked t about how different they are compared to street dope.<br />Im currently on 8mg of bupe. normally the strongest heroin in the city i can do 2 -3 bags and get a very good high. This is very nice long legs and a nice rush. + euphoria. the liquid is very clear and brown in color. its #4. When i tried Mindgurus back in december it was yellowish powder plus rocks. Now It was very strong but had almost no euphoria and no rush. Yet if i did like .05 or less i would nod hard. Whats odd is if i did a little more i know i woulda OD&#039;d Anyone else have this experience ? is heroin that is higher in purity the #4 powder have no rsh and no euphoria. Or a very slight rush i should say. the color of mindgurus was clear and very light yellow as opposed to my normal brown clear liquid im used to from the street stuff. I found that very very very weird. Then i tried the BTH. now normally BTH around the east coast does nt exist and i found that although i had to use more of it. The BTH was more what i was used to in terms of rush and euphoria.&nbsp; The BTH i used up way way to quick. a half gram barely lasted me a day since although the rush and euphoria were good after a couple hours the legs would be gone. I love the high i get from my street heroin which is very weird considering. but lately its been SO SO hot when i go down the way since only 2 spots have the best stuff the cops are all over it. So now its april and ive decided to give Silkroad a chance again. I dont wanna waste money testing stuff out. <br /><br />So has anyone had that experience with #4 heroin? <br />I would love someone to tell me what color the heroin is from dragoncove and marlo stanfield. Also how is the rush and euphoria and the legs.<br /><br />Im going to split this post up so i dont have a whole book written. <br /><br />Anyone else have this experience from Mindgurus stuff? was his just a bad batch? i mean it was definatly an opiate and a very strong one since like i said i was on 8mg of bupe and shooting up 50mg made me nod but only nod nothing else. Looking for some help
