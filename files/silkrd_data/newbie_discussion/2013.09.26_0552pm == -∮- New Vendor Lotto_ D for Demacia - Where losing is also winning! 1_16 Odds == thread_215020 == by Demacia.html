				-∮- Welcome to the Kingdom of Demacia -∮-<br />Exporters of only the finest pharmaceuticals<br /><br />-∮- Shipping to:<br /><br />Ireland<br />The European Union<br />The United Kingdom<br />The United States of America<br />Canada&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />__________________________________<br /><br /><br />Introducing the &quot;D&quot; for Demacia Lottery - Where losing is also winning because you get 15% off your next order just for playing.<br /><br />1:16 CHANCE TO INSTANTLY WIN FREE PILLS OF YOUR CHOICE!<br /><br />-∮- Prizes for WINNERs:<br /><br />Any one of the following can be selected as a prize (free shipping included):<br /><br />⋅ (Quantity of 10) Percocet 10mg Pills<br />⋅ (Quantity of 10) Hydrocodone 10mg Pills<br />⋅ (Quantity of 10) Hydrocodone 5mg Pills<br />⋅ (Quantity of 10) Adderall 30mg IR pills<br /><br /><br />-∮- Prize for NON-WINNERs:<br /><br />⋅ 15% OFF your next order or 10 FREE PILLs added to your next order.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Very simply put...<br /><br />-∮- The lucky letter is... &quot;D&quot;<br /><br />If the last digit of your ticket&#039;s transaction ID is &quot;D&quot;, then you WIN your choice of free pills!<br /><br />Since the last number of a transaction ID can only be A-F and 0-9, you have a 1 in 16 chance of winning.<br /><br />(Once you purchase this lottery ticket you&#039;ll be able to see your transaction ID on the [orders] page of your account. Then you can immediately tell if you won or not.)<br /><br />-∮- RULES:<br /><br />◾Buy only 1 ticket at a time. If you buy more than one at a time, you&#039;ll still only get 1 transaction ID.<br />But if you buy only 1 at a time, you will get a unique transaction ID for each separate order you make.<br /><br />◾ You must FINALIZE in order to validate your entry ticket. Failure to do so, win or lose, will result in entry/order forfeiture. And if you had a winning entry but didn&#039;t Finalize within the required time-frame, you forfeit your entry and winning prize.<br /><br />Also, try to avoid letting the lotto entry order auto-finalize as that will negatively affect your buyer stats.<br /><br />◾There are no limits to the number of times you can play/buy a ticket.<br /><br />◾Win or lose, please leave a 5/5 feedback. It&#039;s the fair and good sportsmanship thing to do. And you&#039;ll see why below...<br /><br />◾ Please DO NOT fill out the address field. It is NOT used for this lottery. If you win, we will make you a custom order listing of your choice of free pills.<br /><br />-∮- WINNING:<br /><br />If the last number of your transaction ID is &quot;D&quot; you win! PM us and let us know what pills you want and we will make you a custom listing of the pills you desire. Free shipping included.<br /><br /><br />-∮- LOSING: (actually equals winning.... Read on to find out how.)<br /><br />If the last number of your transaction ID is NOT &quot;D&quot;, you merely lost your chance at free pills.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />Anyone who plays the lotto and doesn&#039;t win is granted 15% OFF their next order -OR- 10 FREE PILL added to their next order!<br /><br />Just PM us before you order and include the lotto transaction ID and we&#039;ll make you a custom 15% OFF stealth listing of either the product and quantity you wish to order -OR- 10 FREE PILLS added to your next order.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Best of luck to you!

				-∮- Note:<br /><br />When you win, while you have to finalize your entry before claiming your prize, you DO NOT have to rate or review until you receive your prize. This keeps everyone honest. <br /><br />Likewise, if you lose, you merely have to finalize your entry. You don&#039;t have to leaving a rating or review. But it&#039;s good sportsmanship to leave a rating. You took a fair chance based on the random TX# SR generates per order. There&#039;s no behind the scenes roulette table on our part that&#039;s biased towards the house. Rather, it&#039;s a fair and honest system that can be easily audited. <br /><br />-∮- Demacia!

				So are you going to list the winners in this thread? I guess maybe some don&#039;t want to publicize their names. I find these lotteries too easy to get scammed on, however yours seems very honest since I know I won if I get a D.
