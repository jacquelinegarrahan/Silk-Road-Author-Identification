				Hi!<br /><br />I&#039;m new on the forum but have been on SR for a while now.&nbsp; Have only purchased digital goods, however, and never made a purchase that required shipment. I wanted to ask if there is anywhere that consolidates an (up-to-date) list of best practices for purchasing and accepting shipment from Silk Road vendors of Cannabis?<br /><br />I notice the product description from one vendor suggested using real name on the packaging rather than a fake name, however, this seems like quite a bad idea, no?&nbsp; Also, for an urban resident (think row-home with only a mail slot), what types of advice can you offer on setting up to receive a package?<br /><br />Thanks to all!

				Hi there,<br />There is a thread on shipping practices, that offers good advice on also receiving parcels. Speaking to your vendor, and letting him know your set up he may be able to give good advice, as they have shipped hundreds of parcels and surely have &quot;ways&quot; As for the name, using a name that has been established and you have received mail for in the past is a good idea. Fake or not. If you throw some random name out there, it is likely to be &quot;undeliverable&quot; or draw more unwanted attention as your mail carrier will not recognize it.&nbsp; Hope this helps, if only a little:)<br /><br />BlueDragon

				ex-resident would be the way to go for me. The man keeps receiving letters to do with Christian organizations, so I figure he wouldn&#039;t mind lending his name for the delivery of a sacrament.
