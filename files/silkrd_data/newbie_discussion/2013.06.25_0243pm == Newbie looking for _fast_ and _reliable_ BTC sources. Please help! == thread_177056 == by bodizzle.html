				USA : http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm&nbsp; (Blue Sky Traders). Reliable, anonymous, cheap (3% fee).<br /><br />Anywhere else you&#039;ll have to go with localbitcoins.com if you wanna stay anonymous.

If you&#039;re in the US and have a bank of America somewhere near you, go with them. All you have to do is deposit cash there and that&#039;s it.

				I&#039;ll accept PayPal for $35 worth of coins since it&#039;s a low amount. In the future I can have you pay my associate in the US or use Moneygram. I do have a lot of Canadians who frequently buy my coins but there are some times when I really need to cash out.

				BST shouldn&#039;t take 3 days... More like 1 day :<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We track your completed deposit online and then send your bitcoins to the address you have provided, by 10 AM CDT the next morning.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Localbitcoins is a lot slower because it takes time for the vendor to set up a meeting with you.

				Hey try Bitinstant you can set up a cash deposit and go to any local CVS/Wallgreens/Walmart you wire funds to a 3rd party company that send the funds to Bitinstant and you can have the BTC deposited into an email or a direct address. You need to make an account using real information not using tor (I think they partied with a public records company because there going to ask you some very personal verification questions to verify the info you gave them was correct). It&#039;s important to remember that buying BTC is not illegal so using real information will not harm you. I like being able to pay cash idk how much more anonymous it is seeing as my personal info is tied to the account but I don&#039;t have to get banks involved. For extra security always change the wallet address you send to and change your SR address so your never sending funds to the same place. On top of that the transactions are lot in the data blocks that make up the BTC market. <br /><br />This is just my personal suggestion when buying BTC or making a wallet on Mt. GOX or w/e your doing involving obtaining BTC just use your real info don&#039;t make it look like your trying to hide something because there legal your doing nothing wrong all the anonymity comes in when you transfer those funds to different wallets and eventually the road.<br /><br />Only down side is probably the fee&#039;s but they have a calculator on there so you know exactly what your getting.&nbsp; <br /><br />EX of verification questions.<br /><br />1. You live with Mary Jane in which zip code?<br /><br />List of random zips one will be yours<br /><br />2. What model vehicle is registered to this address?<br /><br />List of random vehicles<br /><br />3. The person Mary Jane falls in to which age range?<br /><br />List of random age ranges

				+1 localbitcoins if you use a buy online method it&#039;s pretty much instant, and in my country all the vendors allow you to do bank branch deposits too for instant release.
