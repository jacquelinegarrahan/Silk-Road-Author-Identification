				I am not a new member but had to change my username for reasons I&nbsp; dont want to go into. But I have had at least 20 perfect transactions ordering diesel on here . So I place a few orders on 6/4 for multiple items and 2 of the 6 items were from&nbsp; (dieseltherapy)&nbsp; &nbsp;all of my other orders by 3 other sellers were marked in transit and i have received some of them already. Here it is 6/10 and my order is still marked processing WTF I paid extra for fast shipping. Is any one else having problems with this guy. And if are can anyone give or recommend another vendor that has great quality diesel that ships quick. thank you

				No other recommendations, sorry.&nbsp; My order with DieselTherapy has still not arrived and it has been 5 business days.&nbsp; It was to be shipped priority, which should take 2-3 days.&nbsp; He is a new vendor (2 months.) Apparently he&#039;s off to a rough start.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read several posts from people complaining about delays.&nbsp; Most of them have reported back and said they received their order.<br /><br />He updated is SR page and said something about delays and that things should be on their way now.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what to think.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;m not upset about my order.&nbsp; He says he ships within 24-48 hours.&nbsp; So, with priority, I expect tomorrow at the latest (ordered marked in transit on jun. 5) [Note: I have read a lot from people saying their order was marked in transit before the postage date on the letter]&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thats what I am seeing I just canceled my order for a full G and switched it to a half of one so i could afford the 1-2 day shipping. Because I only had a certain amount on bitcoins available hopefully he is up and running and I get it soon.

				Hopefully.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little nerve wracking.&nbsp; Assuming he caught up on orders on the 9th when he made the update to his profile, I would expect mine to be here tomorrow at the latest.&nbsp; *sigh*

				Any update on your order, adderall? I&#039;m getting the idea.&nbsp; Its been taking people 7-12 days to get his mail.&nbsp; For me, it&#039;s been 7 business days + Sunday.&nbsp; Hoping for arrival prior to the weekend.

				God damn DT.&nbsp; I regret ordering from him.<br /><br />DT, if you&#039;re reading this (you probably aren&#039;t), get your fucking shit together.&nbsp; It&#039;s not just me.&nbsp; EVERYONE in your review thread who recently placed orders from you has experienced delays.&nbsp; It seems like you came through for some people but left others (like myself) in the dark.&nbsp; You haven&#039;t even read people&#039;s PMs yet your profile shows you are active on a day to day basis. <br /><br />I would love to give you the benefit of the doubt, being a new vendor and all; however, I can&#039;t help but to speculate when you fail to communicate with many people who trusted you with their money;&nbsp; Who wait 10+ days for priority mail.&nbsp; I hope you get your shit together and come out on top.&nbsp;

				Delay??? Ha! I ordered almost two weeks ago and this slacker not only didn&#039;t come through - he never answered ONE of my messages.<br /><br />I would not take anything from him for free! - who knows WHAT he is cutting his stuff with, it just may kill you! <br /><br />I would take his product and flush it right down the toilet (not like I would ever receive it!).<br /><br />This guy should be BANNED from the ROAD.<br /><br />He gives all vendors a BAD name!

				Seems to be a number of vendors experiencing usps delays right now. Hopefully it just has to do with usps issues and nothing more. Sucks though. It&#039;s rough on the nerves.

				When you get so far behind that you can&#039;t keep up with email messages then its time to stop taking new orders and devote your time to catching up with your mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes but its how you rectify them is what separates the creme from the crap. Not responding to messages is crap!!!!!
