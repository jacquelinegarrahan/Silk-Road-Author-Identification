				Do prices adjust for bitcoin fluctuation on the road?&nbsp; A few weeks coins were around $14, but now I see they are around $20. I&#039;m trying to figure out if I send coins to my SR wallet and my setting to show USD will it be the same amount of cash I deposited.<br /><br />More specifically, I deposited (after charges) $288 into my MT Gox account. If I buy coins at the current rate and (allowing for some shuffling between other wallets, of course&nbsp; ;D) send them to my SR wallet, will I still have $288? Or will fluctuation impact it and I could gain/lose a few dollars?<br />

				It seems like the prices are pinned to USD and not to BTC. What I mean is that it appears that even as bitcoin rises, the prices on SR stay the same. What i think will eventually happen though, is that vendors will raise their prices if bitcoin goes too high in cost.

				The rates change so often, it&#039;s upto the buyer to get their coins when the rates are most favourable. <br /><br />After you&#039;ve actually purchased your coins though, your exchange rate drama is over. <br />If you&#039;ve bought say, ฿20.00 ..you will still have ฿20.00 when you put them in your SR account.<br />Rates do not affect already purchased coins.&nbsp; <br />

				Yeah, the easiest way to think of it is this:&nbsp; You are buying X number of BTC, once you have bought them, it doesn&#039;t matter if they go up or down in value, you will still have X amount of BTC.<br /><br />Just have to be careful to not leave them in there while BTC takes a nose dive<br /><br />-AA

				Yep, that is what I do.&nbsp; The only thing that sucks is when you buy them, and before you can get your order placed, it fluctuates and you are like .50cents short&nbsp; :o<br /><br />-AA

				Yeah, I see your point but, I have been advised to never leave BTC in my SR account, because its vulnerable to hackers/scammers. Or if the site goes down ( which I doubt and have every faith in DPR. Rather leave it in a Wallet( not 3rd party) or make sure the emergency return BTC address is meticulously typed. So SR can send my BTC to my addy if the site needs to. surely if the coins are safe in my wallet they can&#039;t fluctuate ? Do they have to be in my SR account to be immune&nbsp; from fluctuations? And is having a personal wallet the safest way?
