				Hello SR forum,<br /><br />I have been a vendor here on the road for 5 months. Ive bumped in to a few difficult buyers but so far i have been having a blast serving you guys. I had more than a few customers tell me i should start a review thread and be active in the forum. MR money is here to stay so i have decided to take their advice. You guys will be seeing alot of me around here. My goal is to learn some new tricks and make some new friends. Instead of doing just another boring review thread im going to spice things up a bit and try to make this thread fun and exciting for all of us. The first person to post in this thread will get a free gram of bud AND free shipping. This is my way of saying thank you for your business. My business would not have become what it is today without you guys. I look forward to chatting with you guys and seeing where this thread takes us.<br /><br />&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/06b4755b22

				What made you decide to take the plunge as it were and risk so much to become a vendor on SR?<br /><br />I find it really interesting! (I obv have only just done so too)<br /><br />Btw... I&#039;m a vendor, so I don&#039;t want to give anyone my address which is a real shame, but you&#039;ll have to offer your freebie to the next person!)

				I ordered white XTC speakers from MR. Money Months ago. He does not have this listing anymore but I have to write a review about them.<br />I ordered 5 of them and took my first one like 30 minutes before lunch at school. They were 200mg each. As soon as lunch ened I went to stand up to leave and almost fell over. I was like woah im rollin hard. On my way to my room i went to walk up the stairs and tripped so hard that my hat flew off a couple feet. My vision was easy and my body was in pure heaven. The rool was so smooth and great. I ordered 5 more before I went home for christmas and took one and let my friends split one and we stayed up the entire night just talking and smoking.<br />He ships very quickly and very stealthily. I have not experienced communication with him because I have never needed to. He is a great seller, 5 out of 5 for sure. Have not tried his Weed but his mdma was high quality.

				Hello friend,<br /><br />Thank you for the warm welcome. When i found out about SR i started off as a buyer pushing locally. After so many successful purchases i could not resist the allure or becoming a vendor and serving people around the world. I find it very exciting and im glad i decided to take the plunge. <br /><br />Its a shame you must pass up the free gram of smoke. But if you are also a vendor you made the right decision. Have you ever heard that saying dont shit where you sleep? I love all those clever little sayings. I find them very inspiring and i tend to remember them. I will be whipping them out now and then and i hope you guys enjoy them as much as i do.<br /><br />Since you are passing up the free gram the next person to post will get it.

				The Moroccan hash this guy has gives excellent bang for one&#039;s buck. Like he says, it&#039;s not the best shit out there, but what he fails to mention is that it&#039;s certainly the best stuff you&#039;re going to get at that price. I ordered a 1/4 and couldn&#039;t be happier with what I got. I just placed an order for 2g of the Malana Charas hash and I am 90 kinds of excited, this stuff looks/sounds great. Also shipped fast, but wasn&#039;t hidden in anything (usually orders I or my friends have received from other vendors typically come in a DVD case or something) which I really don&#039;t care about as it was still vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Anyway, you sir have yourself a regular buyer now.

				Mr Money here to stay? Nah? Mr Money is long gone. Probably selective scammer. I saw him doing a &quot;FE SALE&quot; for Butterfly labs FPGA miner. I thought, yeah right. I&#039;m gonna Finalize EARLY for something that is rare and expensive. I decided to check back a few months later. Guess this guy is here to .......wait........stay? Nah. Selective scammers don&#039;t stay they take the money and RUN!
