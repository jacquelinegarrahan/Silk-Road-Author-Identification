				Hello, I am new here and relatively new to drug use. I am curious is there any drug out there that will help with social anxiety or to be less shy. Adderall works well for me, but I was also looking into xanax or kpin. Any input would be cool, and yes I know the addiction possibilities, I am not going to be taking them all the time only for social events. Thanks!<br /><br />Edit:<br />Thanks for the replies so far everyone. I realize my post was very undetailed so I will try to expand more on my symptoms and what I am looking for.<br /><br />In social situations with strangers: I usually get very quiet and keep to myself. I feel awkward and like everything I&#039;m doing looks weird and that people are watching. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t want to talk, it&#039;s more of I can&#039;t. I literally can&#039;t think of anything to say. I think possibly because I&#039;m to occupied worrying. My brain just feels numb during this. When I&#039;m ln adderall I can think of lots to say and feel confident. Otherwise I would feel unnormal/uncomfortable and kinda zombie like..hard to explain. I have only taken adderall 10 times at most.<br /><br />When I am with friends though I am usually fine, it might take me a little to feel comfortable but then I can function normally just a little quieter than I would like to be.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps explain further. Thanks.

				Everyone reacts differently to substances, you should experiment and see what suits you best.<br />Keep it safe though. You know, don&#039;t kill yourself.

				And xanax is actually prescribed for social anxiety, but benzos are addictive.<br />That&#039;s another factor to keep in mind.

				Take some mushrooms alone in a shamanic way and you will realise you never needed drugs for anxiety in the first place. Do as much research as possible (and not wikipedia, try erowid instead) and when you feel educated enough you won&#039;t have any trouble finding them :)

				Clonazepam is a nice minor relaxant which can help.&nbsp; Metoprolol seems to work even better (it&#039;s a cardio drug, but has off-label use for social anxiety/performance anxiety).&nbsp; &nbsp; You can get a general anxiety drug like buspirone, but it really was never very effective for me at all..

				I would recommend Diazaepam (Valium) rather than Xanax if your new to Benzos all you should need is about 5mg Valium to take away your social anxiety whereas Xanax are a good bit stronger and you may end up over confident and making an ass of yourself which i have done on numerous occassions. Be careful though Benzos are really addictive i still HAVE to take some before going to a social gathering or i walk about shitting myself at nothing though that could be the copious amount of weed i smoke. <br />Good luck Guys<br />Rondo

There are no substances that help you out in the long run, they all fuck you up eventually. Psychedelics can give you a whole new perspective on your life, and an entirely different way to deal with your anxiety.<br />( Even ketamine had this effect on me, which is a very powerful antidepressant btw, in case your anxiety has deeper roots)

However it took me 6 years of a weed addiction before i realized what was lying behind it all. Now, you might not have the symptoms as I have, but this is what made me feel human for the first time in my life;<br /><br />First of all, due to my weed addiction i got signed up to a rehab clinic, this is probably not the best word for it, but a place where I could come and talk to other addicts who had just quit weed...and other drugs, but I didn&#039;t see many of these people. However alongside with these group meetings I got to talk to a couple of psychologists, and I think this is what helped the most. On top of that, after going to the clinic for half a year, I got to talk to a doctor who prescribed sertraline for me, internationally known as Zoloft if i&#039;m not mistaken. Now, you can find tons and tons of good and bad review of this medicine on the internet, but what it basically does is blocking the serotonin from leaving your brain....a more detailed explanation of this, you&#039;ll have to search google or talk to a doctor.<br /><br />However, this medicine made a huge impact on me, and my life for that matter... you can go ahead and believe this if you want, and if it sounds like too much of a cliché, it&#039;s also ok; however, after a couple of months on the medicine (it takes 3-4 weeks before it has stabelized in your system) i could finally put some of the anxiety away. Which actually made it possible for me to - for the first time in my life - ask a girl out.... at the age of 26. Yes, the problem with anxiety issues like this, is that it&#039;ll only build up, and your anxieties will get more and more self-fullfilling the longer you keep them to yourself, and trust me, I know how hard this is to deal with, because that part of you who knows how ridiculous those thoughts are, is also aware that it&#039;s so ridiculous people will just laugh at you for even trying to explain it to them. At least that was how I felt about it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re up for it, talk to a doctor about it, and if you have the options I have, seek some professional help before the anxiety takes over completely. I know this is a very delicate matter, and I got lucky that I got pushed into all of this.<br /><br />However, you were looking for a drug? ...now this might sound like a huge contradiction to many people, but even though I&#039;ve been through rehab and all that stuff I still can&#039;t completely give up on drugs, cause altering your state of mind is just really pleasant from time to time. I don&#039;t really like weed anymore, but there&#039;s plenty other substances out there. So yeah, to the contradiction. Anxiety is in the family of depressions, and the cure for depressions is serotonin (in my case at least), so if you haven&#039;t tried it yet, I really encourage you to try some mdma.. And if this is your first time, I would not encourage a huge ass party with lots of people, but a nice cozy evening with a couple of friends to get an idea of how the drug works.. I had no idea what I got into first the first time, but my first trip on mdma/ecstasy was completely mind blowing, i wouldn&#039;t say I lost all anxiety, but I could control it, in a way that only someone with anxiety/depression can understand. And on top of that I was finally capable of talking about it with my very close friend, and we ended up just spending the whole night talking about all these things that we apparently had bottled up for ages. This was a very fulfilling night to me.<br /><br />Recently, it has become more of a casual happy drug to me though, and yes, for those who know what sertraline is, they&#039;ll know that it can&#039;t go hand-in-hand with mdma, because they fiddle with the same parts of your brain only in a different manner, but whenever I&#039;m planning a rave or something like that, i have to get off the medicine for a week or two, which I know no doctor in the world would approve of, but I do it anyway, cause I can&#039;t contain myself when there&#039;s mdma in the air :p<br /><br />So yeah, I hope at least some of this helps :)<br /><br />EDIT: I just noticed the long-term part, and I would say that in this case you don&#039;t have many options, seek professional help, get your problems sorted out with a psychologist and get a doctor to help you with some sort of medication to ease the anxiety. Then when you feel ready for it, you can get off the medicine without any too big side effects, and you might as well get out of this with a brand new perspective on life.<br /><br />However, i would still really really encourage an mdma trip, just to feel what it&#039;s like to be able to control your anxiety... but only once or twice, because if you take it too much you&#039;re FUCKED and you&#039;ll need more than just a doctor and a psychologist to ever get out of that shit.

				I suffer from the same thing. I was on prozac for like two years but did not notice too much difference, so I decided to stop and after like a month without it I got really depressed with suicidal thoughts. Also during that time things were not going as planned in my life and that also contributed to my depression. I would advise from taking any drugs to help you with that issue. I would recommend to try to push yourself and be as social as possible, hang out with friends,go out, try to avoid staying at home whenever you dont have too and it will come naturally.

				Mate, in all honesty<br /><br />Try to get some professional help rather than buying drugs against the symptoms on SR. this won&#039;t help you in the long run, it would be more likely to actually increase your problems actually.

				If you are really asking about the condition as defined by the dsm, you need to seek treatment with a psych, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy.&nbsp; Classical and operant conditioning can be used (and will be more beneficial in the long run) fairly easily to help train a person to be less anxious and more out going.&nbsp; Someone mentioned Prozac and Zoloft.&nbsp; I personally dislike anti depressants because of the physical effects.&nbsp; I know you said you were aware of the addiction properties of benzos, but what about the anti depressants?&nbsp; <br />Benzos are weird with me on dosing and strength but DO help with things like anxiety.&nbsp; I have a sensitivity to the less potent ones, preferring 1-2mg of ativan or xanax if I feel like I am having a panic attack, but seem to have a tolerance to the stronger ones used in med procedures like versed - lets just say I FULLY remember a HORRIBLE procedure.&nbsp; But, that is probably just the statistical differences in reactions.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are asking about partyin..&nbsp; Have you ever had benzos?&nbsp; You said you liked adderall, which is more of an upper, where as benzos are downers.&nbsp; Different people different reactions, but a benzo would NOT make me a more socially out going person...&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, marijuana is a primary choice for many.<br /><br />I have not had the opportunity to try, but I would be more interested in the mdma that was suggested.&nbsp; Again, I have NOT tried it, but I have also gotten interested in the rc 25I-NBOMe.&nbsp; Some people around here have some of the 2c series of rc&#039;s.&nbsp; 2ci was the one that always sounded appealing..&nbsp; There were a lot of raving reviews, but all it did for me was make me feel extremely medicated with narcotics - like how one might feel if they had just been given a shot of iv morphine in the hospital (real hospital experience, super bad with needles), after the rush is gone and all you can feel is the over whelming desire to lay down and close your eyes.&nbsp; Then I was puking for the next 48 hours. The nbome is not supposed to have the nausea that the 2ci had.&nbsp; I probably just did not agree with that drug, but decided not to try any more of the 2c series because of that, but REALLY want to try the nbome now.&nbsp; I find it sad I have not been able to do more research in this area, but if you are wanting social/party things, this is the area I would want to investigate.

				Years ago I used to experience some of the same things. For me though it was mainly having to speak in front of others or being in a situation where lots of people are looking at me. Sometimes I would even experience panic attacks in places where there were a lot of people. I told my doc that I didnt want to be on anything long term and he prescribed me propranolol. Its mainly used for people that have high blood pressure. Let me tell you it worked wonders. Its a beta blocker that blocks the chemical that causes your heart rate to go up and feel anxious or panicky. Also in doses used to treat anxiety there isnt much risk for dependency and it doesnt make you feel drugged up like benzos do. I only took it when I knew I was gonna be in a situation where I might feel anxious. For me after I got used to speaking in front of others I found I had the confidence to do so without using the drug. Definitely consider going to a psychiatrist and asking about it. Being that theres a low potential for abuse its easily prescribed.<br /><br />Also I recently tried ghb and it was an awesome experience. Its like molly but with the care free feeling alcohol gives you. I wouldnt recommend using it to treat your anxiety as it can be addictive both physically and mentally but as far as just having fun a couple nights a month it doesnt get much better than ghb.

There are no substances that help you out in the long run, they all fuck you up eventually. Psychedelics can give you a whole new perspective on your life, and an entirely different way to deal with your anxiety.<br />( Even ketamine had this effect on me, which is a very powerful antidepressant btw, in case your anxiety has deeper roots)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Social anxiety is the only reason I&#039;m on SR. I&#039;m intensely focused on how I look, sound, and act around others an fear being seen in a negative light. I&#039;ve been feverishly trying to put my finger on my inner turmoil since sophomore year in high school and eventually realized it was social anxiety. I was prescribed prozac at age 18 for a year- didn&#039;t do anything at all so I dropped it. I&#039;ve also experimented with benzo&#039;s- they make you feel drunk and uninhibited on the come up, but the comedown magnifies your problems. I&#039;ve also tried an antipsychotic (seroquel) which made me COMPLETELY normal/calm/relaxed/real for a day. I&#039;ve yet to experiment more on this, but I feel a throbbing in my head when I take it. The long term side effects make it a big no-no though. I eventually turned to spirituality (starting with Ekhart Tolle&#039;s &quot;The Power Of Now&quot; audiobook) which is where the change really started. The ultimate goal is enlightenment (being free of desires and illusions, able to take full command of your mind). Meditation is emphasized, and it can really help put your problems into perspective, but I was never really skilled at this. I eventually learned that psychedelics, particularly LSD, is comparable to meditation and attaining enlightenment the same way a helicoptor is comparable to a rock climber- you can get there MUCH faster. This is now my journey. I&#039;ve tried LSD a few weeks ago for the first time and it really helped me put my thoughts into perspective. I&#039;ve learned much more about life as well. It&#039;s a drug everyone should do regardless of their condition, but a necessity for us. <br /><br />The problems of the mind can&#039;t be solved on the level of the mind- that&#039;s what got you into this mess in the first place. You have to watch your thoughts as they happen and realize that a thought is taking place whenever it is. When you do this, you change your relationship with the thought. Do this not only for thoughts, but for the identities that arise (ego). We all play different roles around different people- but we are none of these identities. Notice when an identity arises and the act of noticing it will distance you from it- you will drop the false role you are playing and step back into your own skin. This act of thought-watching is called mindfulness. Watch the thought, feel the emotion, observe the reaction. This whole process becomes second-nature with LSD. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend MDMA as it can permanently deplete your serotonin levels. But if you must, please take caution: wait 7 months between full doses and take vitamins before and after the trip (&quot;preloading&quot;/&quot;postloading&quot;). LSD, however, is completely safe, and actually addresses the thought patterns causing the problems by helping you realize that these misconceptions you have about yourself are nothing more than mind-stuff. <br />

				DMT might help you have a better understanding as it did for me... Hallucinogens (LSD for me) Helped me see by being on it and seeing others on it that we all are weird and i have learned to embrace it...&nbsp; MDMA will most likely make you feel at least a few moments of having little or no social anxiety and help you work your issues especially if you take it with a person who&#039;s advice you respect... but i have found that the best way to cure social anxiety is making a few good friends who have you back in social situations and make you realize its okay to be you.... you can learn things though drugs but you can&#039;t take things too far or you&#039;ll fall off the edge and ended more of a weirdo then when you started =P&nbsp; Good luck to you..... <br /><br />PS-Stay away from the popular street pharms... i haven&#039;t seen much good come out of them... (benzos, amphetamine classes, opioids) Weed also makes me very socially awkward though i embrace it now, it didn&#039;t make me want to talk to girls back in high school... being i was more interested in the vending machine and my iPod&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br />&nbsp;

				GHB can help individuals realize how much love and beauty there is in the world, lower inhibitions, and help you be more social and talkative. It&#039;s pretty safe for occasional use (i.e. once a week or so) and is pretty inexpensive. I can&#039;t speak highly enough about it for the increased sociability that it can affect!

				Thanks for the replies so far everyone. I realize my post was very undetailed so I will try to expand more on my symptoms and what I am looking for.<br /><br />In social situations with strangers: I usually get very quiet and keep to myself. I feel awkward and like everything I&#039;m doing looks weird and that people are watching. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t want to talk, it&#039;s more of I can&#039;t. I literally can&#039;t think of anything to say. I think possibly because I&#039;m to occupied worrying. My brain just feels numb during this. When I&#039;m ln adderall I can think of lots to say and feel confident. Otherwise I would feel unnormal/uncomfortable and kinda zombie like..hard to explain. I have only taken adderall 10 times at most.<br /><br />When I am with friends though I am usually fine, it might take me a little to feel comfortable but then I can function normally just a little quieter than I would like to be. <br /><br />Hopefully this helps explain further.

				I haven&#039;t read much of what the other members wrote to you OP, but this is what I&#039;m going to say ;<br /><br />If you do start messing with Benzos(alprozolam, diazepam, clonzepam, etc) be careful. They are very addictive and the withdrawals can be deadly. A low dose of alprozolam(xanax) may help you, or even a low dose of diazepam(valium) . Just be careful is all I&#039;m saying, I&#039;ve seen to many bad things go wrong for abuse of benzo&#039;s, hope for the best for you.

				I see a lot of quick fixes here (like benzos) and while no two people are the same, I have found a more sustainable solution for myself. Not just afterwards, I actually made it; no more faking it.<br />1. 37.5 Affexor (SSRI, similar to zoloft/prozac)<br />2. 70mg vyvanse in the AM<br />3. Exercise (light walking is fine if you don&#039;t have time to go to the gym, anything is better than stagnance)<br />4. Don&#039;t fap. I&#039;m serious about this one. You know that feeling when you&#039;re around people after fapping and it feels like they can tell? This is there more often than you notice, and testosterone actually propels you forward in social situations. Ejaculation saps you of your testosterone and you become withdrawn and unmotivated to put yourself out there. There&#039;s a whole lot more info/discussion on this nofap thing at reddit.com/r/nofap (members call themselves &#039;fapstronauts&#039;)<br />I haven&#039;t in almost 50 days and I&#039;ve never been more generally stoked and outgoing.

I realize my post was very undetailed so I will try to expand more on my symptoms and what I am looking for.<br /><br />In social situations with strangers: I usually get very quiet and keep to myself. I feel awkward and like everything I&#039;m doing looks weird and that people are watching. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t want to talk, it&#039;s more of I can&#039;t. I literally can&#039;t think of anything to say. I think possibly because I&#039;m to occupied worrying. My brain just feels numb during this. When I&#039;m ln adderall I can think of lots to say and feel confident. Otherwise I would feel unnormal/uncomfortable and kinda zombie like..hard to explain. I have only taken adderall 10 times at most.<br /><br />When I am with friends though I am usually fine, it might take me a little to feel comfortable but then I can function normally just a little quieter than I would like to be. <br /><br />Hopefully this helps explain further.

				a pill wont help you for social anxiety, it&#039;ll only be a crutch for you, and it could get you dependent on some shitty pill. <br />You just need to talk to people more, and it&#039;ll get better with time. It&#039;s not something you can force. Dealing with people is just like any other skill or talent, you&#039;re going to have to fuck up before you get better, and feel comfortable doing it.

				I recommend the psychedelic experience to any of my friends who confide any kind of social anxiety in me. I always tell them nothing has given me more perspective on life or provided me with more spiritual comfort than a good trip.<br /><br />Mushrooms are about as safe and a sure thing as they come- make sure you are in a good set &amp; setting and then blast off! I recommend doing an eighth of them with a few close friends so that you have some people to reflect on the experience with afterwards.<br /><br />MDMA is also excellent for overcoming any physical anxiety. It&#039;s hard to beat a good night dancing to some electronic music!

				Bingo. Socialisation is the key... just get out there with winners and diverse people....&nbsp; whatever works for you.. but the other key key is to try to socialise with people who are going places... or are at least making a sincere self driven effort to get somewhere whatever their situation.

				I don&#039;t know if this has already been said, but if it is a really big problem,schedule an apppointment with your doctor. I had a similar issue when meeting new people and I found it much easier to talk to people on cocaine. Now I don&#039;t rely on it as much and meeting new people it definitely easier for me.

				Hydroxyzine (Atarax) is prescribed for this.<br /><br />The nice thing is that it doesn&#039;t get you too high if at all. Kinda gives you a DGAF (Don&#039;t Give A F***) attitude.<br /><br />But MDMA is a good idea too.

				no, seriously, stop that... use all this stuff for fun or insight or whatever... don&#039;t use it as a crutch...<br /><br />I have a firm believe that is an express route in to the dark void of our soul.<br /><br />Just get yourself out of your comfort zone, take up public speaking... you&#039;ll sweat more than a nun in a whorehouse but I guarantee you&#039;ll literally, sweat it out.&nbsp; May even take a few years.<br /><br />It took me a good five years or so before I felt comfortable, perhaps a solid decade where I just stopped giving a shit, but now I just leap up and speak about whatever, to whoever.<br /><br />Also ensure you don&#039;t have any issues with being &#039;passive&#039; aggressive... learn to stand up for yourself and set boundaries, develop your confidence, don&#039;t take shit from anyone (but do it constructively, don&#039;t be aggressive about it).<br /><br />Follow this recipe, then light a big fat one after, and you&#039;ll be dancing on sunshine.. trust me..<br /><br />Counseling also works well.. but you may need to keep it up for a long time.&nbsp; Deep trauma is like being constipated, you really need to work to push that shit out.<br /><br />don&#039;t think drugs will fix your problems... they&#039;ll only mask them and stunt you.

For me though it was mainly having to speak in front of others or being in a situation where lots of people are looking at me. Sometimes I would even experience panic attacks in places where there were a lot of people. I told my doc that I didnt want to be on anything long term and he prescribed me propranolol. Its mainly used for people that have high blood pressure. Let me tell you it worked wonders. Its a beta blocker that blocks the chemical that causes your heart rate to go up and feel anxious or panicky. Also in doses used to treat anxiety there isnt much risk for dependency and it doesnt make you feel drugged up like benzos do. I only took it when I knew I was gonna be in a situation where I might feel anxious. For me after I got used to speaking in front of others I found I had the confidence to do so without using the drug. Definitely consider going to a psychiatrist and asking about it. Being that theres a low potential for abuse its easily prescribed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I totally second this recommendation of propanolol for social anxiety.&nbsp; A beta blocker doesn&#039;t even really feel like a &quot;drug&quot; drug --- you don&#039;t feel out of it like with benzos.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken them in combination, in fact, and it works quite well once you know your tolerance for different benzos.&nbsp; My father is an anesthesiologist and he recommended it to me for public speaking, which I have to do about once a year and it used to tie me up in knots for *months* just anticipating the anxiety.&nbsp; I think it works primarily to counteract that flush of adrenaline and other chemicals (including cortisol, maybe?) that you get when really panicky in a social situation.<br /><br />Another sentiment I&#039;ve noticed in this thread that I will heartily second is that benzos are very different.&nbsp; Doctors may claim that xanax, klonopin, and valium are essentially the same thing and that multiple scrips are redundant.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s dead wrong.&nbsp; I actually have scripts for all three for different reasons:&nbsp; I use klonopin for anxiety, xanax for chronic pain relief and valium only occasionally for insomnia (it gives me a horrible headache the next day).&nbsp; I mainly use benzos for dealing with a very serious chronic pain problem but I also have generalized anxiety disorder and benzos have literally been a godsend compared with anti-depressants.&nbsp; I personally haven&#039;t had any problems with benzo addiction (when I don&#039;t need them when I&#039;m having a &quot;good&quot; pain week I don&#039;t even think about them) but I know many other people have struggled with that so it&#039;s not something to take lightly.<br /><br />The only other drugs that I would recommend for severe anxiety are strong opiates or narcotics, but that&#039;s an &quot;emergency&quot; type treatment, not really feasible for daily (and definitely not social) anxiety.&nbsp; Dilaudid works wonders for extreme anxiety from pain (I&#039;ve heard a another patient poetically describe it as &quot;a warm shower inside your own body&quot; and that&#039;s a great description) but you&#039;re high as a kite so it wouldn&#039;t work for your needs, I think.&nbsp; But maybe good to try in pill form for at-home emergencies. <br /><br />The only anti-anxiety drug I would strongly advise against would be Atropine.&nbsp; Maybe other people love it but I think it&#039;s not that great and the hangover is beastly.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m preaching to the converted on this forum but drugs can work miracles for body pain and pain in your soul.&nbsp; Anxiety is a sneaky bitch and I wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone.&nbsp; Keep fighting the good fight and best of luck to you.

				Spend more time pursuing the things you enjoy. Find real satisfaction in your life and proceed to not give a fuck about saying the right thing or impressing other people. Be yourself, and allow other people to do the same.<br /><br />You can try going for a run or something that gets you physically or mentally active before going into a social situation. You might be surprised at how it can change your mood/state of awareness.<br /><br />And I find a couple of drinks always works well for me if I find myself a little wound up.
