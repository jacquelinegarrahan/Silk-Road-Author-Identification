				He had an update on his xanax listing saturday that orders wouldn&#039;t go out until today.&nbsp; It&#039;s still processing however, and I&#039;m wondering if I should cancel at this point (I made the order Friday morning).<br /><br />I&#039;m not in absolute dire need for this, but really need it by Monday at the latest.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Our pal Al is one of only two vendors that I routinely re-purchase from.<br />No worries, he&#039;s never failed me. He&#039;s just behind because of the postal holiday, I&#039;m sure.

				Luckily I haven&#039;t used in a couple weeks so I&#039;m not exactly hurting, but I was really hoping to have it this week, by the weekend at the latest.<br /><br />What sucks is I made an order with Frylexa the same time (last Thursday) and haven&#039;t seen that yet either. Not sure whats going on with them but they&#039;ve gone into stealth mode.<br /><br />So, basically I&#039;m hoping something shows up today! I&#039;ll update when I can.
