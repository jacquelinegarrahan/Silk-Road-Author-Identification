				Safety. I&#039;m new to all this and realized if I get scammed, as a flaming newbie, I don&#039;t have the ability to spread the word, and potential scammers I&#039;m sure are aware of this.

				Very True Wayne.<br /><br />I believe there are samples available to certain established members on these forums aswell.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to be able to leave a few reviews for my fave vendor. There were almost no decent or recent reviews. would have been nice to have had some peace of mind reading an informative review. Although everything went perfectly anyways.

				But we can and should post it right here. We can also give them 1/5 and a bad comment. Most of the reputable vendors, IMHO, don&#039;t want to risk a lower rating to scam a newbie.

				fuck that, we&#039;ll create our own less perfect but adequate version of the non-newbies Rumor Mill.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve noticed is that the blowhards tend to be those with poor impulse control, they talk too much, and listen too little, that are &quot;hero members&quot;.&nbsp; Fuck them, they are just as prone to fucking up and being unreliable scumbags, weak idiots and flawed imbeciles like the rest of us.&nbsp; I say, &quot;Fuck all of them, in the ear.&quot;

				I&#039;m not sure if there is any real benefit nowadays.&nbsp; With the amount of users growing exponentially SR may decide to increase the posting cap in order to deal with junior-newbies flooding the main forums.
