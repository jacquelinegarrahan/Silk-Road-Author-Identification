				My first 2 orders arrived like clockwork from same vendor...<br />i used same fake name and address...<br /><br />After that i got excited - placed another order with my original man and 2 more with different vendors.<br />Now the 2 with the other vendors are like 20+ days without arriving.<br />And now my other order with my original vendor is 2 days late compared to the the first 2 successful ones.....And in my waiting time i also have placed another order from my original vendor using same name and address which is about 5 days in transit....<br /><br />So i have 4 orders all going to the same address with&nbsp; same name and 3 are i suppose late.<br /><br />If customs find one does all the mail to that name and address get flagged?<br />Would customs let me know in someway?<br /><br />orders <br />first 2 success was 1g and then 3.5g<br /><br />then orders waiting on<br />1g<br />2.5g<br />3.5g<br />3.5g<br /><br />Yep ALL are FE<br /><br />Back in the day i thought waiting a few hours till my man showed up was bad enough....<br />now waiting days/weeks and checking the the letterbox in hope something has arrived - so disappointed to see its empty....have to check a few times to be sure it really is empty<br />

				Your main fuck up here was deciding to FE.<br /><br />And the fake name thing is very situational. Gotta be very careful when and where used and think carefully on the believability of the name.

				idk whatever works for ya i guess. most vendors will say that<br />they wont re-fund re-ship if a fake name is used witch will then <br />mark it as undeliverable.

				I really don&#039;t understand why buyers FE. The system is there to protect us! You might have gotten packages intercepted, or you could have been scammed be you FE&#039;d. I&#039;m with codemonkey, I use my real name when the product comes to me. My address is posted publically on the internet other places so I can simply say &quot;I don&#039;t know why drugs were sent to my house, someone must be trying to get me in trouble.&quot;<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				i live in a rental property and i used the name that was on a letter that turned up to the letterbox...probably previous person who lived where i do.<br /><br />The FE is the only way the vendors i am dealing with operate with people from where i am from.<br /><br />What to do - just way up the risks......not a big deal imo....<br /><br />most likely customs i think - but would they let you know or would all the mail with that name and address be flagged on some sort of computer system.

				What I gleaned from reading the buyer&#039;s guide and forums before I placed my first order:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Use your real name and address.&nbsp; There is no advantage to using a fake name and/or address,&nbsp; and as the above poster said, many disadvantages.&nbsp; For further detail on this, read the Security forum...lots of very important info and will put your mind at ease after reading postal employees&#039; threads.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; NEVER FE.&nbsp; DO NOT BUY FROM VENDORS WHO REQUIRE THIS.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; Most vendors are great with stealth, but if you receive a delivery of product that is not very carefully sealed (NOT plastic seal-a-meal or only baggies with no outer air tight wrap), say something in your review or pm the vendor.&nbsp; Vendors put themselves and you at risk and will lose business because of bad stealth...they need to know, and want to know if they are falling short in this area.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />It is so awesome to have your product of choice delivered straight to you at your own address.&nbsp; If you follow the guidelines for buyers and advice in the forums, you will avoid ending up in a situation like the OP&#039;s.&nbsp; <br />

Others could be the service took longer than expected to process correctly.<br /><br />2) The owners or agent for the property could have just made the transfer or even put a hold on their service, with their approval or not. Owners and&nbsp; &nbsp;agents have more pull over their property than people realize, because they usually know the postal carries by name and through gifts. (agents is&nbsp; &nbsp; referring to leasing not alphabet mafia)<br /><br />3) The mail carrier could know the previous tenants well enough to know they no longer live there. <br /><br />Now these are just three simple explanations as to why the packages could not have shown up and with more time invested could come up with a grocery list more. Especially given the fact that you FE&#039;d these 5 items. WHY? <br /><br />As well why haven&#039;t you contacted the V&#039;s to find out if they could give you any additional info? They may have had delays or might actually have Tracking.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am just confused to why you would jump straight to Customs have confiscated the items when you&#039;ve only had one or two successful deliveries to begin with.&nbsp; Just some thoughts to consider before worrying yourself about something that may not be the case...&nbsp; :)<br />
