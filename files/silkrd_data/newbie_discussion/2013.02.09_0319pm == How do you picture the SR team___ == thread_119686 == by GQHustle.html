				Hey, sorry if this is posted in the incorrect section.&nbsp; Newb vendor here.&nbsp; I have been using SR for about 8 months as a customer and about 6 months as vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So far it blows that mind that this is going on.&nbsp; A little about me is that before SR, I was in a time in my life with no connects to get anything, I was hitting people up on craigslist (US public advertising site) that claim they&#039;re selling something (E or xannies etc) and then be shit scared to death about meeting up w a narc, and so I would always set it up then get really paranoid and call it off.&nbsp; Before that I was getting research chems of ebay and browsing topix.&nbsp; So you can only imagine how excited I was to find SR.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe that this is going on and is so impenetrable.&nbsp; Against entities like the US government which has a great deal of resources,, and at the moment seems like they can&#039;t do anything about it.&nbsp; To me, it&#039;s like a hustler on the corner that LE can&#039;t touch even though they&#039;re right next to him.&nbsp; Except SR vendors are doing this on a much much grander scale to say the least, so it definitely baffles me.<br /><br />Can anybody estimate how many people it would take to organize something like SR?&nbsp; I know one person can be more intelligent than 1000, but what I&#039;m asking is how do you picture SR?&nbsp; My first newb impression regarding how organized and air tight this operation is, it seemed to me like it&#039;s some type of huge mafia or cartel operation with a beautiful&nbsp; yacht and a satellite connection, like a well funded large organization.&nbsp; But then I look at sites like Black Market BMR with it less organized appeal and it seems like maybe, just maybe one person could have created this.&nbsp; &nbsp; Although i highly doubt it.<br /><br />Do you think it is a coincidence that bitcoins happen to be around and so effective at pulling this whole thing together.&nbsp; I mean what other organization would come close to making bitcoin the type of profits that SR brings in, or am I wrong?<br /><br />Do you think Bitcoin and SR are related, or just a coincidence?&nbsp; Seems to me and my limited knowledge that the two entities would be nothing without each other, right?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for all your input.

				I feel like SR is a few really really smart people sitting around on stacks of money laughing.&nbsp; When I think of the SR I cant help but think of Anonymous.&nbsp; Although I certainly wouldn&#039;t call the groups affiliated, I would say they preach a similar message.&nbsp; This is our internet! You can&#039;t hid from us.&nbsp; As far as bitcoin and SR being related I doubt this.&nbsp; Although, id think they must have some sort of deal with each other.&nbsp; SR takes a lot of money in commission, and I bet they&#039;d like some of that dough in USD or some tangible currency.&nbsp; To do this they would need to use mt gox or another exchange.&nbsp; That exhange must realize that there is one person who never buys any bitcoins and is selling a million dollars worth of them every month.&nbsp; But hey, they are making each other money :DDD <br />I don&#039;t think this is a big organization, and honestly I wouldn&#039;t be that surprised if some of the SR people didn&#039;t even use drugs.&nbsp; I do think, the dread pirate is probably a group of people acting as one.
