				Has anyone heard from him, he hasn&#039;t been on in two days. I placed an order for a QP.<br /><br />Was just wondering if anyone has heard if he had something come up. I needed it ASAP, and I thought he would be on by now. I mean I expect to get it, but I placed the order Friday, and he hasn&#039;t been on since.

				Hey guys<br /><br />I was away last for 3-4 days due to a situation beyond my control. Nothing SR related, and as a matter of fact it was something unrelated to me.<br /><br />I know everyone is used to getting replies from me same day, so sorry for the paranoia I&#039;m sure this has caused. <br />All orders that were marked in transit were shipped the date they were marked, the only remaining issue is the orders from 3-4 days ago that are still processing. I will throw in 10% extra if it&#039;s been over 4 days (Will ship tomorrow, Saturday). <br /><br />I&#039;ll try to reply to all the PMs within next 2-3 hours. If you have a urgent message for me PM me on forums, and I&#039;ll reply right away <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m very sorry the inconvenience. Everything should be back on track by mighnight tonight<br /><br />Peace<br />Caerus

Sorry for the lack of communication. I will reply to you on SR as well shortly. Let me know if there are any other issues.<br /><br />And one more thing I wanted you guys to know that is you ever see that my listings require FE, you should know that it&#039;s not me and stay away. I don&#039;t have any exit scams planned, and will never ask you to FE unless you are a notorious auto-finalizer.

				I usually smoke Meth...but Weed is good once in a while; especially during a Meth hangover WHICH FUCKING SUCKS AND IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE!!! But Weed definitely helps with Meth hangovers, as well as alcohol!!!
