				Is this a question about preference ?<br /><br />So far i have tried only shrooms not LSD but i think that trip duration is a biggie, when choosing between the two

				I absolutely love shrooms. Many reasons.<br /><br />1. Shrooms are unpredictable. LSD seems like it always takes me to similar mindstates; shrooms never stop baffling me.<br />2. Afterglow. LSD leaves me feeling completely exhausted with a slight headache. Shrooms leave me comfy and just generally relaxed.<br />3. They grow wild like everywhere.<br />4. The character of the trip is very dark, mystical and morphic. And it makes me feel like a gnome ;)<br /><br />LSD is nice to. Looking forward to testing higher dosages; might change my opinion in the future.

				It might be relevant that the best trip I&#039;ve ever had was when I combined LSD and Shrooms. I took a light dose of LSD (60-100 µg) then two hours later I took 60 liberty caps (semilanceata - should be around 4g cubensis). Peaked ten minutes afterwards. No body-load, no acceleration-period, just pure triptastic excellence. I recommend it for anyone who has experience and access to both ;)

				I like LSD better for three reasons:<br /><br />1) Like someone said before, shrooms can be more dark and mystical. This can sometimes be awesome, but I found that it only takes one or two bad images/thoughts to get stuck in my mind and kinda haunt me for the trip. This usually is nothing more than a recurring thought that I have to put down, but its distracting and worrisome if the dosage is high. I still love shrooms, but I have to be super careful of my environment when I take them<br /><br />2) The method of taking. Putting some paper or liquid on your tongue is a lot easier and less disgusting than munching on some dried stems, especially if you have that nasty fucking shroom shake XP<br /><br />3) The duration. I always feel like right when I&#039;m about to settle into a nice, long hallucinogenic experience on shrooms, they fall off and I come down. Good LSD keeps me going for 8-10 hours depending on the dosage.
