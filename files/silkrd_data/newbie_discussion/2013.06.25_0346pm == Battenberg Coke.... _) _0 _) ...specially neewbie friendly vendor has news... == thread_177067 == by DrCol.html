My latest stock has this beautiful sweet almond aroma....very natural and cool - summer has clearly arrived :)<br /><br />Anyway, onto business...this new stock is on listing now - clean columbian cola for you guys who enjoy a life...and seriously having tried this on delivery...well...it really is as sweet as it sounds.<br /><br />You are all therefore cordially invited to partake in a little sweet cocaine courtesy of your friend, Doc<br /><br />(oh and first class service, speedy dispatch and top class customer service all given as standard to you)<br /><br />Cheers all - have a great evening<br /><br />Doc

				Good luck with your gram my friend....I&#039;ll be curious on quality there. Often these &quot;grams&quot; are not all they appear ;0<br /><br />The pricing here is higher than street to reflect many factors. My prices are in line with quality vendors - perhaps a little cheaper than many...so as you consider your purchase, there are some factors to focus on.<br /><br />Purity - lack of cutting agents and bulk<br />Quality - direct from source or near to<br />Service - efficiency, speed, communication, stealth standards, packing<br />Ongoing customer services - if any issues arise, do you have good relations and someone with a decent attitude to deal with<br />Integrity....a very valuable commodity on here...and one which I personally feel I offer my client base<br /><br />But, of course, the market is free and open to competition, so if you feel you can get something similar to my product cheaper, and you are happy with the service offered, I applaud you and wish you well.<br /><br />Kind Regards<br />Doc <br />

				exactly...<br /><br />If you find it here at that price, with that service level, I&#039;ll buy as much as they have...I think you&#039;ll be sorely disappointed or scammed within hours..but I sincerely wish you well.<br /><br />;)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc
