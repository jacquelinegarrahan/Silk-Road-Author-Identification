				Hey SilkRoad,<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked everywhere and can&#039;t seem to find an answer so here it goes.<br />For my first purchase of bitcoins I used Blockchain as it was recommended to me by another user.<br />However, for some reason it&#039;s just become all fucked up especially since the bitcoin market has become expensive.<br />Are there any other legitimate websites to buy bitcoins for customers in the UK?<br /><br />Also, blockchain takes away 5% of your bitcoins as a service fee or what not. <br />For example - a gram of drone costs £20 on the street. However I had to put in £30-40 just to top it up. <br />Yeah I know the quality is definitely going to be better on the SR but is there any way I can just pay the exact amount without getting ripped off?<br />I mean how am I supposed to make profit?!<br /><br />Thanks guys! :)

				I was in the same situation as you. I used to buy all my coins through Blockchain.info, but they stopped accepting bank transfers so I had no way of getting coins. I tried BTC4Cash UK and found it to be a much nicer system than Blockchain, and they&#039;re slightly cheaper too. Their URL is: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/853d62ae10

				You can use a website called transferwise (a U.K. company) to send Euros through the SEPA system to bitstamp, or blockchain, if you prefer.. It&#039;s reasonably priced and worked for me. I made the payment to transferwise with my debit card and then got them to transfer via SEPA to Bitstamp, I made the payment to transferwise on Thursday and it arrived in Bitstamp on Wed.<br /><br />On a side note, Bitstamp put my payment in twice and I was lucky enough to get it cashed out before they took it back. Unfortunately, I paid $250 per coin and by the time I came to spend them on SR they&#039;d dropped to $120!! now I have to wait for them to go back up again. Karma&#039;s a bitch innit?

Currently for £300 you would get 2.9303btc<br />I have done transactions for £1000+ mate, never had a problem.
