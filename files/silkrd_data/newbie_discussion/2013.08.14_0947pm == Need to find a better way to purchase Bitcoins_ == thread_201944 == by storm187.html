				I am currently buying my BTC from Bitstamp and doing an international wire transfer from my bank account, which i&#039;m pretty sure is not wise being it leaves a paper trail. Bitstamp offer&#039;s a very low fee and that&#039;s what lured me in. Is there a better way to get domestic BTC in the US without paying a huge transaction fee. Also where is a safe place for a secure email address since tormail has been compromised? Thank you for any info or feedback.

				Welcome Storm. Please check out my listing. I am currently offering Bitcoin for Western Union transfer and providing a 15% bonus to my first 5 customers for up to $50. Basically I am eating the WU fee and tossing a little extra on top to establish my credibility.

				Its a shame more people are not using your services if you deliver what you say, which im sure you do. Maybe people are just weary about buying them on SR, ive only been buying on here about 2 months so im fairly new to how things work.<br /><br />Do you sell anything other than bitcoins?<br /><br />Ive seen you&#039;ve been a vendor for a year hows it been man?<br /><br />

				My plan/hope is to get through my initial offer of flat out paying 5 customers to try out my service. Then to offer a very modest rate of around 1% for the first 20-30 customers. Once I am established and reputable perhaps increase my rate to something more reasonable, yet still below what others charge, say 3%-5%. Until I have 100-200 successful transactions then perhaps consider increasing my rate to the standard market rates. <br /><br />Obviously the marketplace will dictate my business, but that is my tentative plan. Although, if I can&#039;t even get a first customer to try me out I might never get this thing off the ground.

				I found it easier to sell on localbitcoins, on&nbsp; avg i meet 15-20 people a week with a 7-10% premium. You&#039;re better off doing that for now and offering a 1% fee here. Funny part is that I know 75% of my customers put them right back into here.

				Def for on here, but I dont use escrow on localbitcoins. The trick is to just advertise on the site and meet everyone in person to bypass the site fees. All transactions are done with current BTC value once cash is in hand then transferred. I dont lock in rates due to the volatility of the market and im expecting a crash soon since Mt.Gox is not allowing any withdraws.

				LibertyCoin- even as a vendor you are not allowed to negotiate transactions off the Silk Road. Whether it&#039;s advertising a personal email or your personal merchant website, neither is allowed.&nbsp; All transactions must go through your vendor account on the main site.

				I was wasn&#039;t negotiating anything offsite, was just giving insight on how to stay afloat since a lot of scamming BTC vendors ruined it for all newcomers. Whats wrong with promoting my site for buying BTC? I paid 4.5btc for the vendor act and everyone knows the coins are coming right back here.

				In the UK what works for me is Bitbargain.co.uk<br />Very fast service and very reliable.I am buying through wire transfer from my bank account and so far no problems what so ever-5 transactions.<br />I use double wallet combo with a friend of mine.Once I buy the coins I transfer them to his Mt.Gox wallet-He later sends me the same amount from a completely legit wallet to my SR account.<br />With small amounts of money eg under 5 coins you want raise any kind of flags...

Almost all moneypak or credit card loader to bitcoin vendors have turned into scammers.<br />I have no where to buy bitcoins anymore :(<br /><br />I just wish there was still a credit card loader, such as vanilla, reloadit, or moneypak, to bitcoin vendor under 10%.<br />Is that to much to ask?<br />Is cryptokeeper legit?

				That&#039;s some pretty incredible feedback you have there MiddleMan. How did you manage to gain so many transactions in a tough market in only 6 days with a 10% commission?<br /><br />Pretty crazy considering I am offering a 0% commission and a 15% bonus for my next 4 customers and still have not found that many takers.. Pretty fishy.. Also some of your reviews.. Why do your customers know so much about your future plans? I guess you just had great conversations with them and made sure they knew every detail of your business and the just felt like sharing that in their review? Pretty generous for someone who just handed you a 10% commission.

				I think you&#039;ve answered your own question, Chan....People don&#039;t really trust the feedback on here, especially for things that can&#039;t go into escrow. It really sucks that people are pieces of shit and just look to scam people, but some people have no other way of living, because they are too lazy to get a job. I need bitcoins, as Coin Base has pissed me off, but I will definitely go through localbitcoins before I bought from SR though. Even though it would make way more sense to do it here, if there weren&#039;t so many scammers.

				@MLG22 - I totally hear you. It is completely your choice how you obtain bitcoin. I am here to provide service and if you choose to use my service, thank you. If not I fully understand. Operating this way has inherent risks. I have offered for any new customer that I would fulfill their transaction in $50 increments and cover the cost of their fees + a little extra to show that I am legit. Hopefully that level of service will earn your business, if not well at least you got to buy bitcoins once at cost and got a little free money for it right?<br /><br />@dradshaw - I responded to your message. Sorry I took so long, I was asleep. If I hear back from you we will move forward. I look forward to hearing from you.
