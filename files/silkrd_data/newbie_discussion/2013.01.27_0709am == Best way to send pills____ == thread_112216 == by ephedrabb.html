				Hi. I have read over the forum a little but wanted a more specific answer. I want to be able to send anything from 1 to 100 pills ( norco/xanax/mdma caps ect) . I want to be able to send express 9 over night ) and have little to no pills crushed in the process. Can anyone share their successful ways of stealth packaging? Thanks for your time!

				why not? isnt this the place to learn how to not get caught? There are other posts about it but I wanted a &quot;updated&quot; version as the other one was almost a year old. I am new so instead of being a dick why not help me out.

				You&#039;re probably not going to get caught/arrested, but that&#039;s like saying your not probably not going to get kill running a red light. Packaging is a sensitive issue for discussion because each vendor has his/her own packaging method. If that method gets &quot;found out&quot; (i.e. discussed) it basically means that any LE who might be reading and happens to want to make a bust has just been given a leg up in making that happen. I&#039;m not a vendor, but that&#039;s the rationale that makes sense. Of course if you want to learn about any vendor&#039;s packaging it&#039;s as simple as placing an order. And we all know how easy that is. If you want to discuss your own packaging publicly there isn&#039;t anything wrong with that. Just don&#039;t expect a whole bunch of people to jump on board such a thread.

				Pills laid flat, vacuum sealed &amp; cut to fit inside of a magazine.&nbsp; :) <br />The more you need to send, the thicker the mag... tape it closed when inserting it into the final packaging. Badda bing...

				I would think it&#039;s ok to talk about packaging, as long as you don&#039;t reveal specific vendor&#039;s methods. I doubt very much that they would thank you for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are PDF stealth guides out there. Just Google.

				Speaking about stealth should never be done on open forums. It gives authorities an idea of the creative ways we may come up with.<br />To be simple, be creative! there are thousands of way to ship things so they don&#039;t look as what they are.
