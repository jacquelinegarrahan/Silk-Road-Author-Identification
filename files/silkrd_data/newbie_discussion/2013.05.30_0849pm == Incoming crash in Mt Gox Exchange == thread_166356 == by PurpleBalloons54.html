				This comes in response to the recent Liberty Reserve crackdown.&nbsp; Mt Gox users will now need to send a state-backed picture ID, and proof of current residence in order to deposit cash into their MT Gox account, deterring new users from using MT Gox as an intermediary for buying BTC, and many current users from using MT Gox as a way to cash out on BTC earnings.<br /><br />

				Incoming can still use Bitinstant to get a Mt. Gox certificate though, right?

				From my interpretation of the information, no, you won&#039;t be able to make bitinstant cash deposits into MT Gox anymore without having your account classified as verified.&nbsp; Tomorrow I would be interested in finding out how a small ($20) attempt to transfer into MT Gox would turns out.&nbsp; Would you lose the cash?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Thought so. You are buying the certificate at Bitinstant and redeeming it at Mt. Gox. Not the same thing as transferring money straight to them.

				You shouldn&#039;t be using MtGox anyway, it&#039;s terrible. They have no PR, too big a share of the market and 0/10 for customer service.<br /><br />I sent them an email and used their live support, on their live support they found my deposit (SEPA transfer) and located that it had been in their accounts but not assigned to me for over a week, they said they&#039;d tell me when that was done but then logged out after 5 minutes. I waited until the next day, still not in my account, it&#039;s like they found the issue then did absolutely nothing about it. So I went back into the infinite queue to talk to live support, got a reply email asking for clarification - I replied with information! - and it took ~3 hours to get through to live support. It took several attempts as well, on like the 5th attempt I got through because I&#039;m not going to focus on a stupid chat window for 3 hours straight.<br /><br />After about 20 days I got my transfer through, utterly absurd.<br /><br />Much prefer Bitinstant. Had no problem at all with them.

				I was addressing how some exchanges have their own certificates, kinda like bearer&#039;s bonds I think. From what I understand, this is what you buy at bitinstant.<br /><br />Someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.
