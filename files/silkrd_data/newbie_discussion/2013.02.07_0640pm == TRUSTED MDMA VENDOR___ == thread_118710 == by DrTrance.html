				I am looking for 5-20 G of MDMA depending on price... Not looking to pay more than 35 USD... And I am looking for clean uncut chunks... I keep getting nice hook up from a vendor and then they don&#039;t have listings by the time i reorder...&nbsp; looking at OldAmsterdam and Powerade atm(anyone know how they are)... Anymore know of a good vendor that might have private listings or something.... I have good buyer ratings and have spent a good deal of money on the road....&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve heard all good things about Marijuanaismymuse, thinking about getting my first order from there. Only problem is he&#039;s Canada so it&#039;s not domestic shipping :( I&#039;m trying to find a good domestic vendor, lemme know if you come across one?

				What a mess. I want shards that are carefully enough synthesized that they&#039;re clear-ish. I&#039;m not looking for party grade. But, thanks to a PMK shortage, seems like prices are up and there&#039;s little supply of top quality too. Blech. You know things are fucked when not even SR can deliver!<br /><br />Oh well. Shortages come with prohibition :/

				There&#039;s plenty of good vendors out there I have worked with in the past but most have pulled all of their listings. Juergen2001 is who I started with and the stuff is top notch

				Yeah I&#039;m wondering about the same thing, though looking for a domestic Canadian vendor. Most of the recent reviews of MarijuanaIsMyMuse&#039;s MDMA have said that it is low quality. I&#039;ve been wondering about CanadianForger, but since he is relatively new he doesn&#039;t have much feedback and no reviews on the forum.<br />

				Jack, MIMM got a new batch recently. I had the old weak stuff (brown, smelled like sass but a bit off..) and got the new good stuff (offwhite? smelled like sass mixed with another fresh smelling odour, I&#039;m not sure if that could be acetone or not) the good stuff was GOOD so if he still has the white stuff you shouldn&#039;t be worried.

				Good to know olDutch, cheers. I had heard the new stuff was white, but its a bit confusing as its still called &#039;tan powder&#039; or whatever...
