				You really have to define what is meant by &quot;society&quot;. There is the global society and the various micro-societies.&nbsp; As other posters have said it is difficult to predict the global society at large. Best bet is to attempt to safeguard yourself against most contingencies.&nbsp; However, needless worry is not a rational preparation. Short of nuclear annihilation some individuals will always survive and might even flourish

				This question is too ambiguous.&nbsp; What is &quot;ok&quot;?&nbsp; And furthermore, which society?&nbsp; Are you asking about humans in general all over the world, or one specific country, or one specific interest group?<br /><br />And okay when?&nbsp; Tomorrow?&nbsp; A billion years from now?<br /><br />Too many unset parameters...<br /><br />Maybe the simple way to answer is just tell you yes.&nbsp; Everything is going to be ok.&nbsp; -hug-&nbsp; Does that put your mind at ease at all?

				My favorite Neil Degrasse Tyson clip is below, when he explains how human beings are 1% different from chimpanzees.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, chimps are stuck in the jungle, killing each others babies, being hunted as food by humans, and slowly losing more and more of their environment, whereas we can send spaceships to Mars and beyond the solar system, speak high level physics and math, watch television, can destroy the planet if we wanted to, and more or less cooperate with one another (you&#039;d let another human, even a stranger, hold your baby, and generally you&#039;d expect that stranger wouldn&#039;t dash your baby&#039;s brains out first chance).&nbsp; Then Neil blows my mind when he says if all that is due to a 1% or 2% difference between chimpanzees and humans, what can aliens do?<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxfJfv9tirU
