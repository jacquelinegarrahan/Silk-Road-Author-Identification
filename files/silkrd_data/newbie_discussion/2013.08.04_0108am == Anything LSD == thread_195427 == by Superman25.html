				These days my favorite way to take acid is to set my alarm clock for 1 hour earlier than I normally wake up. 5 AM Saturday morning for instance.<br /><br />Before I go to bed, I put the acid next to my bed. When I wake up, I pop the tabs in my mouth, turn off the alarm clock and go back to sleep.<br /><br />1.5-2 hours later, wake up trippingggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

				o thats a crazy idea! That was the most I ever took was the 3. When you wake up are you already seeing things or does it take a second to remember you took it. that sounds fun.

				I&#039;m really looking forward to getting the blotters I ordered... Done LSD only two times previously (years ago), it&#039;s quite hard to come by where I live.&nbsp; Anybody got any good advice on what a not-too-experienced tripper could do while under the influence? I&#039;ll probably just end up talking them in my flat the first time, but eventually I&#039;d like to do something more daring. I live in a beautiful touristy area by the water surrounded by mountains so I&#039;m thinking about talking a boat tour or going hiking in the mountains.

				Man, it sounds like you got it down bro. I live in the same kind of setting and it&#039;s BEAUTIFUL already, even more so shrooming. I got some tabs a week ago. Going camping tomorrow for a couple days. Can&#039;t wait! That&#039;s when mine are gonna sing. Hope you have a glorious time !

				Sounds great, have a good couple of days. Only problem with me, is that I can get a bit nervous when doing psychedelic drugs outside of the safety of my home... But I&#039;m going to get over that! We have some seriously cool scenery here, and a wagon on a wire that takes you from the city centre to one of the nearby mountain-tops. Imagine dangling in a metal-box full of tourists on a wire hundreds of feet above the ground while coming up on a heavy LSD trip! With my limited experience of LSD, I&#039;m a bit afraid of freaking out though, so I&#039;ll do some practice somewhere safer first. I really don&#039;t want to be one of those idiots who panicks and makes a scene and give drugs a bad name, ha ha.

What I want to do is take a regular to light dose for myself personally, then wait a couple weeks when the time is just right, and do a heavier dose so I&#039;ll feel a little more comfortable, especially if it&#039;s been awhile since my last dose. Either that or benzos in addition will curb the anxiety, but also the trip to a degree from my understanding. Not trying to push more substances on you at all, everybody will make their own choices, that was mine a couple times on mushies and it helped dramatically.

				ahhh, good ol lysergic acid, my experience was not the best, the first one at least, I took it and felt really really tired, too tired to even lift a finger or my eyes and i couldnt talk, at all, i ended up telecommunicating&nbsp; with my chair and then i thought i saw my cat outside so i ran outside and tried to open my car with a banana and ended up falling asleep on the sidewalk

				oops, sorry to spam but i forgot to put in lsd 2 cents. one time i took with a bunch of friends and we went on a hike in a nature preserve. pretty fucking crazy how quickly we forgot about civilation until a cargo plane passed over head fairly low to the ground ( there&#039;s an airforce base in close proximity).<br />booom minds blown! ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;and then there&#039;s candy flipping, my presonal favorite way to enjoy lsd.

				wow. Machine Maid&#039;s Orange Sunshine was incredible. I went camping at a beautiful lake with my girlfriend. We cut one of those tabs into 3 and only took a 3rd each. That should have been around 100 mics each if they were the 300 claimed. Well I believe it was. I can&#039;t believe how much just a third affected me. I&#039;ll post a report later, too tired now. But let me tell you, Those were the shit guys and gals, I would HIGHLY recommend if you like good &#039;ol LSD...
