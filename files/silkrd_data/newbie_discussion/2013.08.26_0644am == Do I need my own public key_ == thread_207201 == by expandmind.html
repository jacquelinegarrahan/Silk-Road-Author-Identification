				I just had a look at the settings page of my account profile, can&#039;t seem to find anywhere to put the Public Key. I guess you would only need to give it to people who you want to be able to send encrypted messages to you. <br /><br />If you send somebody a message encrypted with their public key, you could put your own public key in said message, that way they can use your key to reply to you.

				If you&#039;re a buyer it isn&#039;t really necessary - most vendors have them. If you&#039;re a vendor it&#039;d definitely be advisable - inspires a bit of trust to potential customers who might want to encrypt their details.

				Keep it handy.<br /><br />No SilkRoad does not have a feature similar to Atlantis that lets you enter a public PGP key into a profile setting to encrypt your commuinications to and from the vendor.<br /><br />All through this feature to some seems like a good idea it was pointed out by the PGP Club founder Pine that it has multiple flaws.<br /><br />You never know though that some time in the future SilkRoad may have a feature like this that is a lot more secure than the one Atlantis has setup.<br /><br />What you should do is keep your public PGP key always handy to give to vendors that you want to keep important information out of prying eyes.<br /><br />But PGP should not just be used only with SilkRoad it is a very good tool to always have handy to talk in a private manner to other people around the world.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw
