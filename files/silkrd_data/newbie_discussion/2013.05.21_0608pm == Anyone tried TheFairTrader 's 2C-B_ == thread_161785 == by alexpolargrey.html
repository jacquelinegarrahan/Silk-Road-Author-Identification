				And does anybody know how it compares to Mahakala&#039;s or some other vendors? He&#039;s new so there doesn&#039;t seem to be much info on the forums so far...

				I cannot compare it to any other vendors on silk road, but I have had 2cb from a couple of sources prior to sr and HOLY FUCK YES this is some good stuff! 20mg rocked my world with love and sensual joy, and had me equally ready to fuck or cuddle or shoot the shit. Very gentle comedown after about 4-5 hours, and was able to sleep pretty restfully at about 6 hours.<br /><br />VERY courteous service, crazy fast shipping (7 days from EU &gt; midwest USA), EXCELLENT STEALTH (are you sure this is it?? Lol) product is 200mg overweight on a 10g order, and seems to be the purest 2cb I&#039;ve ever had. Cannot rave about this guy or his gear enough...<br /><br />I dub thee, &quot;TheMoreThanFairTrader!&quot; :D Do not hesitate guys, this is the real motherfuckin&#039; deal!!!!!

				I&#039;m waiting on an order from TFT, and I&#039;m stoked, I&#039;ve had mahakalas and it was super weak, at 30mg I had nearly zero effects, lights seemed interesting but nothing more. I hope TFT&#039;s 2c-b will do it for me :)

				Im waiting for a g of this all so. You can order a scale with empty gell caps on line for around $30 with 500 caps. Good way to save big. ;)

				20mg + beautiful/intelligent/equally-dosed woman = one of the greatest psychedelic, sexual and emotional experiences of my life. I&#039;ve tripped harder, certainly, but better? Rarely, I assure you. <br /><br />So. Much. JOY. Holy fuck do I owe you about a billion, TFT. LOVE YOU!!! LOL

				I ordered from Nawlin, it was great! I just ordered 1 g again from him and order a scale and 500 gelcaps for $30. + he was the only vender who told me there was something wrong with my PGP and what to fix.<br /><br />He&#039;s the best!!!

				Just tested my 2c-b I got from thefairtrader, and this stuff is fantastic. Incredibly clean and pleasurable trip. I took 20mg and had an awesome time, I did 35mg of mahakalas and didn&#039;t feel anything to give some comparison. <br /><br />Also, thefairtrader has the most proffesional and stealthy packaging I&#039;ve ever seen. Definitely grab some of his gear if you can.<br /><br />Happy tripping :)

				I insufflated ~4mg of TFT&#039;s superpure 2C-B and I could easily figure that I&#039;m seeing a little different.<br />I did 20mg the next time (on the next day), and had a wonderful experience with some very beautiful visuals and mild euphoria. <br />Finally, I did 30mg yesterday at a psytrance party and trust me, I&#039;ve never had a better experience at any rave! It was mind blowing, the visuals, the euphoria( that was from JoR&#039;s MDMA ) and I tripped out on some digital art for over an hour. The trip was intense and lasted ~6 hours. I had lunch at 5PM and had 2C-B at 6PM. It took three hours to feel the first signs, but heck it was a crazy trip!<br />
