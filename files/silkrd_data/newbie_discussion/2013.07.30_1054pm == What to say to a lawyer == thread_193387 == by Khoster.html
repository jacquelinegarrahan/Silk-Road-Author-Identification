				Depends whether you are still in a police room at the time. If you arent on a phone and in a private location with no chance of being recorded you can be truthful with a lawyer if you have privately paid for them. A lawyers job is to lie, cheat and loophole the system they are generally on your side.

				yeah play dumb request a lawyer and act like you are paranoid of the police not being real police its a good technique then if shit hits the fan you can go down the mentally insane route.. haha deny deny deny! be very careful how you reply to questions take your time and think then lead them on some stupid tangent. you dont really have to say shit till you have a lawyer present. Ive requested to speak to my lawyer before talking to police and just rang up a best friend and made up a load of bullshit. <br /><br />Until you confess your pretty safe if they have hard enough evidence there isnt going to be any questioning. Its all a game of words really.. they are usually just trying to trick you into admitting it.

				Don&#039;t say anything at all.&nbsp; They will lie to you and say things that aren&#039;t true.&nbsp; If you are in the US, you tell them you are invoking your right to remain silent and will not answer any further questions without a lawyer present.&nbsp; That&#039;s it.

				Also tell your lawyer EVERYTHING. If you lie to your lawyer how can they defend you. Plus they aren&#039;t the police wearing a suit.
