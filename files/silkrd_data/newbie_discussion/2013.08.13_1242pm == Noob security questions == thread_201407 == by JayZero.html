			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello guys<br /><br />I am new to SR but I already like it, it&#039;s like paradise. But I am too paranoid to order something from here because I have problems with police right now. My best friend is a snitch (he&#039;s obviously not my friend anymore) and I dealed drugs for like a year and he told them. So now I&#039;ll have to pay them money and they said if I ever buy/consume anything again I&#039;ll probably go to jail. But I love drugs and can&#039;t just stop with them so I really want to order something from here but I have a few questions about the security of tor and SR. Sorry if these were asked before, I searched alot and didn&#039;t find real answers, it just made me more paranoid.<br /><br />1. How safe is Tor? I read somethings about the FBI and that they compromised tormail and such, now my question is how easy is it for them to find out if I use tor? I don&#039;t really trust this whole thing so what can I do to make it safer? I read about a virtual machine or something but I have no clue about these things. And I am using Windows, should I switch to Linux?<br /><br />2. Should I use a drop or not? That&#039;s a big question for me because some recommend it and others don&#039;t.<br /><br />3. Is torchat safe or not?<br /><br />4. I live in Switzerland and I heard it&#039;s not good to order anything from outside of my country, is that true? Someone said we have some pretty heavy boarder controls<br /><br />5. Some forums (like Torum and Tor Market Board) say &quot;IP logged&quot; if you write a post, what does that mean? Did they log my real IP?<br /><br />I already put tor and everything related to an USB stick and encrypted it with Truecrypt but I am still pretty paranoid about this whole thing. I just don&#039;t want to get fucked over by the cops but I would like to smoke some weed, didn&#039;t have anything since June. Smoked everyday before that happened so I want to continue that :)<br /><br />Sorry again, I am sure these things were asked before but I couldn&#039;t find them here. If someone can help a newbie out and improve my security I would love you to death. Sorry for my bad English.<br /><br />That&#039;s all the questions I have atm, I am sure I forgot something but I will post that if I remember it again.<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				Hello!<br />I&#039;m new to SR too and I just made my forum account but I feel like I read half of the forum so I try to answer some of your questions.<br /><br />1. TOR is very safe if used correctly. I recommend to download the bundle pack as everything is already set up and all you need to do after installation is to open it. Do NOT change any of the settings after installation, do NOT download any plugins and such, do NOT use it for any other websites (like Facebook). <br />There were some problems with Tormail, so better don&#039;t use it<br /><br />2. At first I thought drops would be better than getting the stuff delivered to your house but it&#039;s not. When LE comes up to you while you have some strangers package in your hands while standing next to their mailbox it&#039;s hard to explain why you were there at this time and what you are doing with their mail. But if they come up to your house you can still say you have no clue who sent the stuff to you. Someone else could have done it. Just write &quot;return&quot; on the package and when LE shows up say you have no clue what this is and why you got it. Wait a couple of days before opening it. Then you should be safe.<br /><br />3. Can&#039;t give you any information on that sorry<br /><br />4. I don&#039;t know about Switzerland controls but it&#039;s generally safer to order domestically. The shorter the distance the less hands your order will go through. And within a country there are no customs.<br /><br />5. Uh, really? D: Didn&#039;t notice before, if anyone could say something to this, please do. But I guess that it just logged your fake ID so no harm is done.<br /><br />I am sooo damn paranoid about all of this as well! Which I consider as a good thing! Better than being to louzy and get your bum arrested!<br />Read more on the forum and you will feel safer! I do too. I figured most of the stuff, the only thing that keeps me paranoid are those bitcoins. Reading the AGB of the bitcoin site kinda feeded my paranoia. I will just try to find more information about it.<br /><br />I hope I could help you tiny bit, I&#039;m just a newbie myself so I&#039;m not sure about much either.

				&nbsp;Don&#039;t stress over the Bitcoins. They are perfectly legal to buy or sell. Once you get them just tumble them and they will be basically untraceable.

				What do you mean &#039;tumble them&#039;? Send them to different wallets before sending them to SR or what? Sorry, I&#039;m a newbie&nbsp; :P

				yes you can either use a tumbler service like btc fog, or just set up a bunch of one time use wallets to move your btcs through before sending them to sr. I think that sr atuo tumbles your btc, but could be wrong<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, SR tumbles coins on the way in and out. Individual bitcoins, and their decimal divisions, are untraceable, but the process of transferring is forever recorded in the blockchain. If you know a wallet address you can track the transactions it&#039;s involved in. Tumbling is a means of obscuring the chain of transactions.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can use bitfog, for a fee, but not necessary if you ensure that who/where you purchased coins from doesn&#039;t have any trace of your identity. You can then create a couple of online wallets, each from different providers, always using tor and switching identities at each stage. Jump your coin through the wallets and then onto SR, spend with confidence :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For example <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log onto tor<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site A and create anon throwaway wallet 1, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site B and create anon throwaway wallet 2, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit localbitcoins.com<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase coins anonymously from vendor. Once released into your localbitcoin wallet transfer to wallet 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Login to wallet 1 and transfer coin to wallet 2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into wallet 2 and transfer coin to SR wallet<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into SR and wait for coin to hit, then create a new SR wallet address for future use. Never use those throwaway wallets again.

I downloaded the torbundle, installed it and disabled global scripts and Iframe and all that stuff, I read that in another guide. But beside of that I didn&#039;t change anything. The thing is that I also read that there is an &quot;entry point&quot; and an &quot;ending point&quot; when you open or close the tor browser, and those points contain information from you. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true but it keeps me pretty paranoid. Also yesterday I forgot to close my firefox before I opened up tor and now I am a bit scared. I never go to other sites than .onion while I am using tor.<br /><br />About the drops: At the beginning I thought drops are safer, too. But as you said it&#039;s hard to explain if they catch you because you&#039;re basically stealing someones mail and it contains illegal stuff so they probably know that you ordered this. It&#039;s probably better to order it at your own adress but I don&#039;t really like that.<br /><br />The thing is there are not much sellers in Switzerland, only found two that have active listings and none of them have weed, one has &quot;just hash&quot;. I&#039;d love to get my hands on some quality weed but it&#039;s pretty impossible right now. Hopefully there will be more sellers from here in the future. <br /><br />Can I ask you what operation system you use? I hear only bad things about Windows here and I don&#039;t know if I should switch it. I don&#039;t really want to because this is my personal computer with games and other files on it but if it has to be done I will do it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll sure read more around here, better safe than sorry. But this paranoia just won&#039;t go away because I never ordered any drugs over the internet and I can&#039;t believe that it&#039;s so easy. Sometimes I think some of the vendors are probably cops, you never know. I will keep your information in mind, thanks again man! And sorry for my bad English<br /><br />If someone has more information just post it here :)

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s kind of just forum etiquette to make it clear when a link is to the normal web. It should be pretty obvious just by looking at the url. The issue is that when you visit a .onion site like SR your connection is totally encrypted, there&#039;s no exit node that can eavesdrop on your data flow, compromise your anonymity, etc. When connecting to the clearnet you do use an exit node, with the risks that entails, Hitch.

Individual bitcoins, and their decimal divisions, are untraceable, but the process of transferring is forever recorded in the blockchain. If you know a wallet address you can track the transactions it&#039;s involved in. Tumbling is a means of obscuring the chain of transactions.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can use bitfog, for a fee, but not necessary if you ensure that who/where you purchased coins from doesn&#039;t have any trace of your identity. You can then create a couple of online wallets, each from different providers, always using tor and switching identities at each stage. Jump your coin through the wallets and then onto SR, spend with confidence :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For example <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log onto tor<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site A and create anon throwaway wallet 1, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site B and create anon throwaway wallet 2, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit localbitcoins.com<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase coins anonymously from vendor. Once released into your localbitcoin wallet transfer to wallet 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Login to wallet 1 and transfer coin to wallet 2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into wallet 2 and transfer coin to SR wallet<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into SR and wait for coin to hit, then create a new SR wallet address for future use. Never use those throwaway wallets again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you a lot for the detailed answer!<br />The thing is in germany you have to have a bank account to create a bitcoin account but I guess I can open wallets without having to link any identity information with them, right?

When you go on some site that can track your IP it finds the fake one so I think it is safe. Do you have to close firefox before opening Tor? Damn.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like it either, but yeah what else shall we do :p<br /><br />I feel you man, I&#039;m from germany and there&#039;s not that much to order from either. Though I found a vendor for LSD that looks trustworthy so I&#039;m satisfied for now.<br /><br />I use windows too, I don&#039;t know why Tor should run safer on other systems. Also if you only use that other system for Tor it&#039;s suspicious, you know. It&#039;s best to keep it as normal and unsuspicious as possible.<br /><br />I&#039;m soo paranoid too. What we intedn to do it illegal as fuck so yeah. But you only live once and fuck it. Other people managed to order their stuff too so I will try it as well.

Don&#039;t know why, maybe it&#039;s just the paranoia. I&#039;d love to see more sellers from Switzerland, the only thing I can get now are pills and hash but I really want to try some other stuff here, some offers look so good to me.<br /><br />About the windows thing, I read how tormail got compromised by LE and that they used some kind of exploit that targeted mostly Windows users so I am curious if there are more exploits around. Windows is probably the most used OS so they would catch a lot of people with this. I just thought it may be unsafe, who knows what Windows is sending to Microsoft.<br /><br />And dude, I swear, at first I thought that this whole thing is fake too! I couldn&#039;t believe that something like this exists, I mean, you don&#039;t even have to go out on the streets to get your drugs, and they are much cleaner around here. This is so amazing, best website I&#039;ve seen in my whole life :) I will order something next week and hopefully it will be good, I just don&#039;t want to go to jail for it. As I posted earlier, I have some trouble with police right now and they won&#039;t just take away my stuff or give me a ticket, I&#039;ll probably have to go to jail for it. But fuck it, I&#039;ll just try it, if they get me I deny everything. About the vendor cops thing, my vendor doesn&#039;t really have a feedback thread, he seems to be nice and cool so let&#039;s see.<br /><br />The community here is so helpful, I can&#039;t really believe it. Stupid cops, thinking that criminals are shit. This is the evidence that we&#039;re not!<br /><br />I always think my English sucks and that every second sentence is false but it doesn&#039;t look like it is, most of the people understand what I want to say and that&#039;s cool :P<br /><br />Have a nice day mate

				Hey dude,<br /><br />Now I&#039;m closing the other browsers too before using Tor, your paranoia is contagious xD Well we are sucked with our small countries but I&#039;m trying to make the best of it.<br /><br />I bet there are a lot of rumors about LE so don&#039;t believe all the shit they say.<br /><br />In my weak moments I still think it&#039;s fake and you are fake and everything is fake just for the sake to get noobs like me xD Yeah dude, tell me how it went!

And about my deal next week, don&#039;t know if it&#039;s going to happen, my vendor of choice said he has some problems right now and he currently doesn&#039;t have any listings so I may have to wait a bit more. Hopefully he can get things sorted out.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know man, they said I&#039;ll have to go to jail if I buy anymore drugs, but I won&#039;t go to jail for weed, I would leave the country before I do that xD<br /><br />Haha, everyone&#039;s drugged here, I like that :P I like drug users more than normal people mostly but I don&#039;t like alcoholics, they fuck everything up. Stupid alcohol, ban that shit and legalize weed for fucks sake :)<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to chat with you mate, you seem to be a cool guy. Have a nice evening my friend :D

				so far it seems there is two ways things can go wrong, if everything else will work as promised:<br /><br />1. Vendor will make mistake and your parcel becomes suspicious, since vendors are humans they do make mistakes and they can&#039;t do everything correct 100% there is always small chance of f-up, and f-up is going to happen, it is just matter of time<br /><br />2. some random bad luck and your parcel gets picked up for inspection<br /><br />so are you being paranoid? good.
