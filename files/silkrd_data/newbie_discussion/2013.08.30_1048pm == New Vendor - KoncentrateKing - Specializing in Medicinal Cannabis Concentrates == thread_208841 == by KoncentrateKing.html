				Just got my first order! How do I verify my buyer&#039;s stats? I click on their name but it just takes me to messages.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to accept it anyways, just &#039;cause it&#039;s the first order. But for future orders I need to check out transaction history.<br /><br />Thanks for any help!

				I personally think you made the right decision ordering anyways. He most definitely came through big time. Order went out very fast. I wouldn&#039;t worry. He has stellar stats and messaged me numerous times even asking me to let him know how I enjoyed the product. Don&#039;t worry man, he may just be having issues with SR like I have had for the past week. You&#039;re in good hands with KK he&#039;s my go to now for sure! Him and TAF all day!

				The honeycomb is grade A and looks like extactly like it does in a picture, i mean if you showed this to your mom aside from the nice smell she would think it is some sort of wax honeycomb.<br /><br />This guy has some amazingly purged wax.&nbsp; I mean it is Grade A Wax up there with the other guys that sell for more per gram.&nbsp; I got 1/4 of his honeycomb to try and OMG, It dabs amazing, Very potent, and easy to deal with.&nbsp; <br /><br />His transactions are very fast ignore my impatience above in the post, i ordered twice the amount againm before it runs out!&nbsp;
