				Hello Everyone, <br /><br />Has anyone gotten trim from California Dreamin? if so have you made oils or extracts from it? if so what type of yield did you get per ounce?<br /><br />Thank You, <br />DPK

				I just ordered from him to see how it is for concentrates.&nbsp; it should be here today or tomorrow... I usually go with an absolute shatter I&#039;ll update with the yield once I receive and make it

				I have not made any concentrates with it and would love to hear the yield from someone who has but keep in mind that I vape 0.05 of dank bud and have to vape 0.2 of this to be having fun.<br /><br />This is really weak allegorical evidence though, i&#039;m just trying to establish that it&#039;s of a lesser potency than dank bud.<br /><br />Friends also complain and bitch about potency and I just tell them not to fucking buy it and to go pay $330 an ounce instead.

				Psyche, <br /><br />Good point, I have actually never made concentrates from trim, so i forgot it would be of lesser strenght. Like you said, i am one of the people that pay 330/oz to make my oil or just buy it off sr. <br /><br />Thank you, <br />DPK

				I never used trim either so my technique might change a little bit with this....&nbsp; if it ever comes in feel like I been waiting forever...&nbsp; but you guys really pay over 300/oz&nbsp; ???&nbsp; <br /><br />if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m sure this deal will be worth it for you guys with even less than a 15% yield I pay like 220/oz like 240-50 for some exclusive shit and I have no street connects like I use to I deleted my phone book a few years ago and never built it up again... now it makes sense why bud prices are so high on sr cause everyone else is getting raped price wise around the country

East coast prices are very bad, wholesale though i can get it for 230-50. <br /><br />3. how many days since you ordered it?<br /><br />thanks,<br />dpk
