				I tell them I&#039;m a vendor who makes SR money and they won&#039;t even let me post on my own threads until I get 50 posts. My friends are all DEA and local cops who think I&#039;m joking. Seriously, I like not seeing all the spam &amp; scam all over the subforums. For the amount of time I&#039;ve been vending I should have well over 50 by now.

				I&#039;m not sure if it removes the 50 post requirement. I&#039;ve been told to ask inigo for vendor status and there is an option somewhere in your forum account to apply for vendor membership as a forum user. It&#039;s been a few days since I&#039;ve contacted inigo, and week(s) since I applied through the request link. I&#039;ve also been told to ask DPR, which seems like the right way and the only one I haven&#039;t tried yet. I don&#039;t really mind having to make 50 posts since every post I make plugs my vendor thread and SR profile.

				Sometimes I just make a joke that my superpower is the ability to make drugs spontaneously appear. <br />Most of the time though, I&#039;ll say I know a guy who comes from out of state and takes a week to get here. <br />A friend and I both discovered SR on our laptops reading the same &amp;TOTSE thread in his basement, so he&#039;s the only other person I know of that&#039;s aware of SR but we&#039;re partners in crime/non-crime and have kept our shit airtight when talking to police on more than one occasion. <br />I honestly don&#039;t think I know anyone else who would even understand how SR works so it&#039;s useless to try and tell anyone. Besides the obvious reasons. If SR was popular the world over, I&#039;d just start robbing postal trucks.

				If you&#039;re an intelligent human being that cares anything about your safety, you don&#039;t speak to anyone about your involvement in any sort of crime. Being considered a polite, law-abiding citizen who is considered &quot;uncool&quot; is a lot better than being known as the individual who &quot;has the connect.&quot; You know what you are and what it is you&#039;re doing; you don&#039;t have to share it with the world to validate your self-worth.

				its hard not to be a proud member of this community. however when i joined i learned:<br /><br />the first rule about SR is <br />YOU DONT TALK ABOUT SR<br /><br />the second rule is<br />YOU DONT TALK ABOUT SR<br /><br />your veil of a supply chain is ok, however if there is a compromise in the security of your circle LE will be very interested in a DUTCH connection. that suggests you are a big player, even though you may not be. Antennas go up quickly.... <br /><br />i say <br /><br />&quot;This chick i used to date has a friend she hooked me up with&quot; <br /><br />works and is not suspicious. <br /><br />just opinions though. we all need to live under the radar, as long as we do our best LE can keep scratching their heads.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m more comfortable discussing it on TOR with strangers just because, even if they do snitch or are working for LE, who the fuck am I? lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMO if they aren&#039;t tech savvy enough to ensure:<br />1) they KNOW how to check for viruses, rootkits, keyloggers, or avoid them altogether<br />2) Encrypt <br />3) Cover their tracks,<br /><br />they need not know at all.&nbsp; I am not about to tell some friends who ask me to help them remove viruses on their Windows machine how to use the road.

				I have a pretty open group and I like to share the beauties of the world, and with my friends - the knowledge. <br />So yes, my friends are aware and why shouldn&#039;t they?

Most people are way too afraid to make the commitment and just go for it. but you have to admit, if you have an account and you have figured out how this whole ecosystem works you are light years ahead of where most people can get. i like your statement &quot;..willing to google for 30 minutes..&quot; literally it took me about an hour.

				Someone recently was being really nosy about who I get my shit from, and I just kept saying &quot;I&#039;m well connected outside the city&quot; because anything I have looks nothing like what&#039;s been going around. <br />Anyway I got really irritated and told him to fuck off. He&#039;s not tech savvy, just a frequent user of 4chan and other shitty imageboards, and for some reason enjoys reddit. <br />He forwarded me a pictorial titled &quot;How to get drugs from the secret internet (deepweb)&quot; and it was one giant guide on how to set up SR accounts, buy btc and order. I was startled to see this kind of thing circulating the dumber parts of the clearnet, and just told him that it looked fake and was probably run by the DEA. <br />Then he told me he already ordered some bud and showed a bunch of his friends, and they wanted shit too. I said something like &quot;don&#039;t be surprised when you go to get your mail and the cops meet you outside&quot; and generally showed complete disinterest in it. My normal claim is that I get shit from a nearby metropolis known for drugs. <br /><br /><br />What the fuck is happening? I feel as though this could be the end.
