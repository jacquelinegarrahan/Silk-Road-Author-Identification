				Hey,<br /><br />I wanted to make a review of my first orders.<br /><br />First I should say I&#039;m amazed. I was a total noob and I discovered the Road by myself. Till I received my products I was in doubt... But all went very well. My 2 orders were placed Saturday morning and I received them Thursday and Friday EU to EU, although there was snow blocking regional traffic one day during the week.<br /><br />- I got a decent C at a decent price. I&#039;m looking further for better quality although the &quot;straight-of-the-brick&quot; might be a myth on the Road...<br /><br />- I got a 10g sample pack from Atlas2012 who&#039;s is the bestseller for hash, and for 3 days I smile because their products are beautiful:<br />The 4g last quality hash is very good, a great shit to wear in any situation: good soft taste, med effect very clear, all fresh. Perfect after-work smoke or to join a coffee. <br />I can&#039;t really review yet the 3g Manali, but it got everybody very deeply stoned.<br />The good surprise is the 3g Native, a pure product: strong high, excellent taste, my friends and I were absolutely&nbsp; mad about it. We smoke hash together for 15 years, we went several time to Netherlands, I went to Morocco, and I can say this hash is one of the most extraordinary I know and will be my reference as long as possible.<br />Atlas is a true vendor.<br />

				Good to see a&nbsp; new review for atlas, I wanted to make an order with atlas, but read some reviews on the forum saying that there were better so I have not tried it yet. Probably go for the sample pack at some point although 5/5 option of the top quality would be nice.

				You should go for the sample pack if you want to have some light hash, the 2 others are very strong in both their way and I wouldn&#039;t smoke them in all situations I want to smoke (but I smoke much). The 3 combined is a very good deal for me.<br /><br />I will try other hash available but I already know I&#039;ll come back to Atlas, it&#039;s love at first sight with his products!
