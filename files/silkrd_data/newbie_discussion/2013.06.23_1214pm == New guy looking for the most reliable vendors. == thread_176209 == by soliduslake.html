				Greetings fellow navigators of the altered state! I am very fresh to SR and a little hesitant about making my first order. I would love to get yous guys&#039; opinions on the most reliable vendors with the best variety and competitive prices. I&#039;m extremely stoked to get started just need a little guidance. Also any &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;integral&quot; tips, tricks, and advice would be met by gratitude expressed with complete abandon. I am very grateful in advance and happy trails

				What type of product are you interested in purchasing? I could recommend some vendors for you. <br />My advice is to always check the forums for information on vendors and products before you purchase.<br />Never jump on an item because &quot;its such a good price&quot; before purchasing especially if you FE.<br />Scammers use lower prices, a perceived &quot;great deal&quot; to lure customers into FE. <br />There are some good vendors that I will FE for, still a potential risk though.... <br />If you never FE you will negate risk of being scammed and you will have the protection of SR escrow! The SR team is very good imo!<br />If you do FE, never FE more money than you&#039;re willing to lose!<br />If you do FE and lose money, don&#039;t stress it to much. It will only do you more harm to stress about your loss.<br />There are many kick ass vendors on here, what are you looking to purchase? Weed? HASH? LSD? MDMA? COKE? ....... ?<br />&nbsp;

				Depends on what you&#039;re looking for and where you&#039;re from.(Some countries have very poor domestic options) <br />What I recommend though is looking at the best selling for a product you&#039;re interested in, check any that you like the looks of and read as much feedback as you can about the vendor on their page and also search their name on the forums to check if there is a review thread about them.

				start small to test your postal company.&nbsp; <br />in some countries they open almost all the letters without traking to see if theres something valuable inside, without the tracking any complain is in vain couse they can say that the package was devilered to them that way and theres no way to prove otherwise.&nbsp; my brother worked 3 years with the mail company<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if you live in some of those countries you should think about asking a traked letter

				envious has LSD and LSD like products (presently AL-LAD) and is ranked really well on the LSD Avengers thread.<br /><br />Terabithia has some amazing dope, but is a one-person operation, it seems.&nbsp; Usually throws in extras and more than makes up for mistakes.<br /><br />MarijuanaIsMyMuse has never steered me wrong, and has an amazing selection.&nbsp; But some people seem to disagree (they&#039;ve lost 4 points on their score in the past 2 months.)<br /><br />project 4 has the best K I&#039;ve ever done.<br /><br />SuperTrips WILL ask you to FE, but usually has a fantastic turnaround (it&#039;s really a matter of preference)<br /><br />Nod has some good grime drugs (Love me some grime :P)<br /><br />spaceshipUSAsafeship has some brilliant RC&#039;s<br /><br />And we&#039;ve got some cheap DMT, our vendor page is in the signature.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been here a while on buyer accounts so if you want to know our favorites for anything (and we&#039;ve done most of it) just give us a ring.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />~ST

				Also, don&#039;t FE until you get used to the swing of things around here.&nbsp; It&#039;s never worth it and escrow is always a better option.<br />Don&#039;t sign for anything you aren&#039;t expecting to sign for.&nbsp; Actually, don&#039;t sign for anything EVER.&nbsp; If you are asked to sign for something, it may be a controlled delivery.&nbsp; Just tell the postal worker &quot;I was not expecting this and I will not sign for it.&nbsp; Return it to sender, please&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, you lose drugs, but you also cover your ass.<br /><br />If you&#039;re short on an order or want an amount that isn&#039;t listed, contact the vendor.&nbsp; If you have any questions, contact the vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s what we&#039;re here for.<br /><br />By the way, welcome to the crew ^.^

				Wow, I can tell by the amount and the inclusiveness of the responses that I am really going to enjoy being a part of this unique community. I will likely be in the market mostly for: MDMA, LSD(i hear can be hit or miss if not just nbome), H, Synthetic smoking blends, crystal meth, DMT. Also if you guys know of vendors who carry a variety of product in a variety of categories that are trusted that would help with the leg work of lengthy browsing sessions. Not that i mind doing the work or anything, i think we are all fond of a certain level of convenience.

				There is actually a fair amount of good LSD to be had.<br /><br />From my personal experience. Buy LSD from Jannis, albionessentialols, JesusofRave.<br /><br />There are many more great LSD vendors that I have not purchased from. Check out the LSD Avenger thread. <br /><br />Plenty of great MDMA to be had, many good vendors. <br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />&nbsp;
