				Holy shit, you&#039;re right mate. <br />Thats strange - anyone care to shed some light on why thats so effective?<br /><br />Also, if i understand correctly - as long as you route the onion.to through the tor network, you are indeed protected as you would be if you were just using the onion site directly?<br /><br />feel free to correct me though as i know fuck all about this anonymity and security stuff.

Your comment has encouraged me to explain why it&#039;s not as safe though.<br /><br />Going through TOR is simple, your encrypted message gets bounced back and forth between other people connected to the TOR network until it reaches the &#039;end node&#039; at which point the message is fully decrypted and sent on to the .onion site.<br /><br />When using onion.to through your normal web browser, your information is sent un-encrypted and completely accessible by the web hosts and the authorities if they make a request. Their site then encrypts it in the normal manner and follows the procedure above. Your data will also be accessible by your ISP, as-well as anyone sniffing your network.<br /><br />SO I ADVISE ALL VENDORS OR PURCHASERS OF LARGE QUANTITIES TO NOT ACCESS USING ONION.TO UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.<br /><br />The only additional layer of protection would be to use a VPN because at least this covers up your IP address. If looking for a good VPN I recommend &#039;iPredator&#039; brought to you by ThePirateBay, it&#039;s based in Sweden which makes it difficult for your authorities to ask them from your IP details and traffic data. It&#039;s relatively cheap and very simple to set up. It provides dynamic IP so each time you connect you get a new IP and the download speeds are &#039;acceptable&#039;, I.e about 3 MBp/s for me.<br /><br />

				Dumb dumb dumb.&nbsp; Even if you&#039;re using TOR to access it, the exit node you&#039;re using can see your data, your username and password.&nbsp; Onion.to the NSA and the websites ISP can also see all of that information.&nbsp; Anyone who has been using the onion.to, I&#039;d suggest changing your passwords when you get the chance.

The SR is not being &#039;taken down completely&#039; by the DDOS, only slowed down, so messages it sends back to you will take longer. Most people will have a low timeout setting, which means if it doesn&#039;t get a response in X amount of time it&#039;ll cut the connection.<br /><br />NO, your message will be encrypted in the tor network, but once it reaches the end node it&#039;ll be sent as a normal un-encrypted transmission so it doesn&#039;t really matter if you use the TOR network, all it&#039;ll do is hide your IP address.

IS EVIL! would you compare the onion end-to-end encryption with the http connection?? pls stop encourage people to use onion.to<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I clearly stated it&#039;s not as safe as going straight through TOR but I&#039;m certain there&#039;s individuals who would benefit from my advise. Your comment has encouraged me to explain why it&#039;s not as safe though.<br /><br />Going through TOR is simple, your encrypted message gets bounced back and forth between other people connected to the TOR network until it reaches the &#039;end node&#039; at which point the message is fully decrypted and sent on to the .onion site.<br /><br />When using onion.to through your normal web browser, your information is sent un-encrypted and completely accessible by the web hosts and the authorities if they make a request. Their site then encrypts it in the normal manner and follows the procedure above. Your data will also be accessible by your ISP, as-well as anyone sniffing your network.<br /><br />SO I ADVISE ALL VENDORS OR PURCHASERS OF LARGE QUANTITIES TO NOT ACCESS USING ONION.TO UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.<br /><br />The only additional layer of protection would be to use a VPN because at least this covers up your IP address. If looking for a good VPN I recommend &#039;iPredator&#039; brought to you by ThePirateBay, it&#039;s based in Sweden which makes it difficult for your authorities to ask them from your IP details and traffic data. It&#039;s relatively cheap and very simple to set up. It provides dynamic IP so each time you connect you get a new IP and the download speeds are &#039;acceptable&#039;, I.e about 3 MBp/s for me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your thoughts on Private Internet Access? From what I understand they don&#039;t keep logs so even if authorities were to ask for information there would be nothing to give.
