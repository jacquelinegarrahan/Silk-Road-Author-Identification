				On the Tor Blog:<br /><br />Help create a Q&amp;A site for Tor!<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/help-create-qa-site-tor<br /><br />September 16th, 2013 by Runa<br /><br />They direct Tor users to support this:<br /><br />http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor<br /><br />instead of a real discussion forum.<br /><br />If you have ever participated in a typical Q&amp;A site, it&#039;s usually anonymous people voting questions up and down,<br />and not as robust as forums like SR. Why do they insist on pushing for a Q&amp;A site?<br /><br />Please leave your comments on their blog post entry feedback area. Enable cookies before you post.

They have mailing lists which most newbies will never use. They have a blog which contains unorganized posts on different subjects all on one page.<br /><br />TAILS had a forum - which was nothing more than a poorly contained wiki platform - which the TAILS devs shuttered. The TAILS devs posting there were rather grumpy when you mentioned Tor, which is the heart of TAILS, insisting users take their Tor questions to the Tor Mailing List. With the TAILS forum closed, they now offer you the ability to (wait for it) sign up for a mailing list! Just don&#039;t mention Tor if you decide to join. (snort)<br /><br />There are thousands of message boards dealing with complex (or more) discussions where newbies are welcomed. It&#039;s time The Tor Project did the same. There are also large forums with a varying degree of topic complexity which receive thousands of posts per day. Those moderators seem to do fair well in light of the traffic. I&#039;m certain a tiny amount of the money sent to The Tor Project can go towards official discussion forums and there&#039;s never a shortage in volunteers.<br /><br />The only insanity I see is pushing users to a stupid Q&amp;A site instead of designing a friendly discussion forum.

Enable cookies before you post:<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/help-create-qa-site-tor<br /><br />Voice your support for an official Tor forum instead of a crappy Q&amp;A!<br /><br />You may also subscribe to their mailing list tor-talk and post there too.
