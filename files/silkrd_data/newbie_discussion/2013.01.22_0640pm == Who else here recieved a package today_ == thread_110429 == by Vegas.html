				Ha ha HA!<br /><br />One of my last orders came twice. Twice? WTF, right? Yeah. Twice. It happened two days apart. I was running screens to keep my bf away from the mailbox all week, and when I dropped my guard--more drugs! I contacted the seller to see what was up... maybe the first tracking number indicated the package got &quot;lost&quot; or something. Nope..... just a shipping mistake in my favor.<br /><br />I LOVE YOU SR.

Well, have you read any of the many guides to using SR? As an anonymous market, it is your responsibility to protect your identity. This, my friend, is why the SR should be restricted to adults. Grown-ups. The kind of people that don&#039;t opt to synthesize methamphetamine in their living room while their children are playing outside. No. Responsible adults are teaching their children the science and safety of hazardous yet profitable chemicals. They are teaching them about how to safely control chemical odors, such as HCl fumes and NH3 exhaust.... AND never EVER use propane in a confined residential environment without installing INDUSTRIAL grade exhaust and Person Protective Equipment (PPE)!!!<br /><br />LE is about safety. They have a duty to make sure crazy meth-heads aren&#039;t blowing up the neighborhood. This marketplace enables responsible people--and crazy meth-heads--to get high without blowing up their home, or themselves, or their children. So... with my tirade at an end, I say again. This is an anonymous marketplace. If things chill out on the news and in the world--mental illness declines, fewer maniacal rage-kills, and a booming economy with no North Korean/Communist (CHINA) war--then SR will survive on into the ages.<br /><br />So... lessons? PGP... fake addresses, real names? Sure, but not your own. Get to know your neighbors... House sit... etc, etc. Be responsible. Be an adult. A grown-up. And then you can do all the meth you want, but for god sake&#039;s, if it&#039;s after dark, don&#039;t fucking mow your lawn or vacuum your house. Sit in the fucking dark with headphones and good music.... Read a book. Write a book. Read the news. Read the forums. Stay vigilant. Stay reasonably responsible.
