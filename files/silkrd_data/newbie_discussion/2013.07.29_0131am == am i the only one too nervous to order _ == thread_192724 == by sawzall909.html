				I have been visiting SR for quite some time now, and basically just window shopping, even though I have money to play the game, he fright of being caught prevents me from dipping my toe in the water. Being dependent on opioids is probably a prime reason; I&#039;d rather not detox in prison; one of the worst in the US mind you.<br /><br />Anyway, just wondering if I&#039;m the only window shopper :D<br /><br />Peace and Love<br />

				First time jitters. Take the plunge! Think about how many people do it. Think about how miserable post-people are(no offense) they simply want the day to be. that being said I do more often than not play it safe and order domestic.

				you know it&#039;s interesting, that whole foreign/domestic ordering; at least from a US point of view. <br />Anecdotally, there is a lot of information that ordering , for example, a US CIII med from US to US address is much more risky than importing the same CIII med from a foreign source, or even a CII or CI med from a foreign source!&nbsp; &nbsp; Intra-US transactions ending in jail time, while similar or identical inter-continental transactions simpy ends up with a love letter from customs, and not a darn thing else is heard about it! <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame they can&#039;t just shut down this ridiculous prohibition apparatus and start focusing on rehab, re-integration, supply quality to those that haven&#039;t hit rock bottom yet, etc etc but hey i&#039;m preaching to the choir.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe one day I&#039;ll take the nestea plunge.&nbsp; (showing my age).&nbsp; Of course, feedback on stealth is probably the greatest piece of info to know going in IMO.&nbsp; For now, I just window shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the best to everyone<br /><br /><br />

				I used to be like you, but then I made my first order and I was amazed to find that SR actually works. It felt like christmas when I got the package in the mail. I&#039;ve made a few more orders since then and they&#039;ve all been great. All domestic so far though.

				my suggestion is buy from a vendor with a rating of a hundred with a shitload of previous transactions.&nbsp; Look through the first couple of pages of their feedback (sometimes people will leave a 5 out of 5 out of fear of being blacklisted but will still speak their true feelings in the comment box)&nbsp; make sure you search their username in the search box on the forums and see what else is being said about the stealth and quality and so on.&nbsp; and then order and enjoy.&nbsp; Trust me when that package arrives you&#039;ll feel like a kid finding santa clause in your fireplace.

				protip: go to the rumor mill and then search your vendor in the search box. it will only search for them within the rumor mill then.

				You eaither have big balls or you dont. I have been to prison and accept that i may go back one day, accepting imo is important. No point in acting like your invincible and will never see the inside of a cell until you do! With that being said SR is the safest way for anything illegal and takes a majority of the risk factor out.

				theres always the chance to get busted.<br />it also depends on the package and on the vendor.,and the product you want to buy.<br />i purchased acid and it delivered because most chances it want get busted because even if you scan it there is no evidence its lsd,but if i bought weed more chances to get busted because of smell etc.

				Just do it already!! pop that cherry! In my mind its a hell of a lot safer than ordering stuff off the street. this way you have plausible dinieability (cant spell).. <br /><br />Go for stealth order domestic, start small, and have fun.<br /><br />I was window shopping for a while well I did my research good it got me down. <br />Now I only go on the site to buy or for research otherwise it just makes me wanting.<br /><br />Hope you find your strength, if not you might look back on this with disappointment in the end.<br />

				i know the feeling - reading the busts re sellers obviously demonstrating incredible stupidity and lack of security has kept me from pulling the trigger. Layer on top of that the story of the secret service busting that well known ID forger (seven years ago) and using his name &amp; operation to run a sting for six more years - that one didn&#039;t help me feel any more comfortable. Then factor in my heightened general paranoia.....<br /><br />so yep, i know how you&#039;re feeling.

				If it is your first order, order small and buy domestic. Also bear in mind that vendors will also see you as a potential risk based on your lack of buying history so contact them, get a feel for how they come over. Don&#039;t FE if asked, it isn&#039;t necessary. Place your order, relax, wait, enjoy!

For the bitcoins I would go to ~~CLEARNET~~www.localbitcoins.com~~CLEARNET~~ and set up and account. It&#039;s tor friendly and you don&#039;t need any personal info. You can find a vendor and meet in person, do a bank transfer, or deposit money directly into an account and get your coins that way. Take your time when doing everything so you stay safe and don&#039;t skip any steps. You&#039;ll be sooooo happy when you see those coins in your account and you go to place an order ;D

				The first time I placed an order, I can&#039;t even begin to describe how nervous I was. But, as long as you deal domestically with a vendor with an excellent reputation, there&#039;s really nothing to be worried about.

				It took me a good month before I plucked up the courage to actually order anything! But this has to be better than buying drugs from anywhere else. Go domestic as international is probably more serious if you do get caught.<br />Good luck!
