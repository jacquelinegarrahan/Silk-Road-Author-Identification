				I saw there was recently a problem with making deposits is this part of it or is this usual that there is a delay? This is my first time buying bitcoins and i&#039;m just really anxious I don&#039;t want to have lost them somehow.

				That&#039;s why you always first test with 1 pound or something. <br /><br />It can really take a long time though. How long has it been? If less than 6h don&#039;t even worry about it.<br /><br />You can also check in your SR account what your address was (don&#039;t request a new one) and see if that was the address you transfered to with localbit.

				If not sure check http://blockchain.info/address/yourBTCaddresshere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; put you bitcoin address where it says it will tell you if the transaction has been sent.&nbsp; Third party wallets can take a longtime to show bitcoins
