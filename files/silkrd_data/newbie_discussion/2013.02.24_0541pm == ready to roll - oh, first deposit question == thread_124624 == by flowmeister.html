				Greetings All,<br />new user here.<br />I like to flow.<br /><br />And would like to use this premium service, lot of cool vibes about this place. :)<br /><br />So, I am sorting the bitcoin thing.<br />getting things together.<br /><br />The one thing I don&#039;t understand is ... how do headquarters know when i have made a bitcoin deposit?<br /><br />I mean ... i could set up the bitcoin software ... and deposit funds into my own bitcoin account...<br /><br />But the directions for getting bitcoins from my bitcoin account into my SR account seem to be very simple.<br /><br />So simple, that I don&#039;t understand how they would know it was me.<br /><br />As in ...<br /><br />&quot;<br />Once you are ready, send your deposit to ...&quot;<br />so ... they don&#039;t seem to say, &quot;and make sure your bitcoin account name is the same as your SR account name&quot;..<br /><br />Do I need to make my own Bitcoin software account somehow connected to my SR account, like use the same name?<br /><br />The 3rd party bitcoin vendor I am looking at, who seems to have a fine reputation,<br />doesn&#039;t seem to make it possible to send a message along with a deposit.<br /><br />So this is my newb first post and most likely very simple question.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />FM

				ohhhh ... i see! <br /><br />the directions..<br /><br />&quot;Once you are ready, send your deposit to ...&quot;Once you are ready, send your deposit to ...&quot;<br />is actually giving me the address of my own individual SR account.. cool.<br /><br />So i have installed the Bitcoin Wallet software on the macbook..<br /><br />tomoz i go and make a bank deposit to the Bitcoin vendor&#039;s account..<br />and make a note of my own Bitcoin wallet address...<br /><br />that then requires between 1-15 hours for transfer, depending on the Bitcoin vendor...<br /><br /><br />and then ... from my Bitcoin wallet account,<br />I send money through to my Silk Road account ...<br /><br />cool!<br /><br />

				I would just add one totally important thing to pay attention to.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what wallet service you&#039;re using, but whichever one you select you should encrypt for your safety.&nbsp; But when you have an encrypted wallet, DON&#039;T LOSE OR FORGET YOUR WALLET ENCRYPTION PASSCODE.&nbsp; There is no way to recover your bitcoins if that happens.&nbsp; They vanish into a black hole, never to be seen again.&nbsp; I&#039;m telling you this because I&#039;m one of the idots that has done it.&nbsp; Can&#039;t remember the amount exactly but it was more than a few hundred.&nbsp; I was tyring to be especially secure by using a new hard to crack password with upper and lower case and&nbsp; +#@( special characters and all.&nbsp; Well it was unhackable but totally forgettable too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do that.<br /><br />Jack

				cheers JB for the heads up.<br /><br />and cheers xloveralot for the excellent affirmation :)<br /><br />so, i was re-reading the buyers guide ... <br />and noticed it is actually possible to have the bitcoins transferred directly into my SR account ...like, directly from the Bitcoin vender..<br /><br />&quot;reputable exchangers that will take many different forms of payment for Bitcoins. When they ask for your receiving address, give them the address on your account page that looks something like this: ..&quot;<br /><br />So ... I guess i could do that ... or give them my own Bitcoin wallet address, and then transfer from my wallet to my SR account ...<br />not quite sure what the best way forwards is..<br />I guess both approaches are cool.<br /><br />Any advice on whether direct deposit to my SR account from the Bitcoin vendor is recommendable?<br /><br />cheers <br />FM&nbsp; :)

				Well first of all you should be getting a new address for each transaction you make, either your offline wallet or SR account. SR tumbles the coins so they are mixed with other people&#039;s coins to make tracking harder. There is always the possibility that a bitcoin address might get discovered that is connected with SR since all the transactions are public in the blockchain but I think it&#039;s a waste of time for LE to monitor small bitcoins transactions. As for me I prefer after I buy the bitcoins send them to my offline wallet where I can manage them better, then send them to a tumbling service that mixed further the coins and leave them for maybe a week there, and then to SR where they are mixed further.

				that makes a lot of sense ... many thanks ephedrone :)<br />i like your style.<br /><br />well, ima use the offline wallet to start with.<br /><br />each new purchase Bitcoins, <br />make a different address,<br />perhaps even using a different wallet.<br /><br />thanks again for the technique, very cool.

				Not a problem&nbsp; :)<br /><br />And also to add some information, most of the offline bitcoins clients require you to download the whole blockchain to your pc and as it goes to 90% the download will be very slow since the blocks are being verified. The past blocks are kinda &quot;locked&quot; so they download faster. I remember there are some clients that connect to a server and do not require the whole blockchain to be downloaded but it&#039;s not entirely safe, pretty much the same like online wallets only in this case you can have backups of the wallet in the pc. The blockchain takes half a day to be downloaded. <br /><br />As for tumbling/mixing your coins before they go to SR I personally recommend bitcoinfog.<br />Here is the CLEARNET site: http://www.bitcoinfog.com/<br />there are some useful information there.<br /><br />And here is their onion site: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br /><br />Have fun and research as much as you can before your purchases. Safety first.<br />Enjoy the ride&nbsp; ;)

				at the perfect place, in the perfekt moment, PK&nbsp; :)<br /><br />cheers ephedrone for the clearnet connex.<br />and yes, have done a fair bit of research today..<br /><br />so .. i have one more question i guess..<br />um, okay this is going to sound complete newb territory..<br /><br />do i put my own name for the postal address to send the gear to?<br />or maybe make a subtle variation on the spelling..<br /><br />i don&#039;t know the name of the previous renters ..<br /><br />and does it make any difference between a domestic parcel or for express (domestic) post deliveries,<br />in Aus,<br />like would they require ID?<br /><br />for a small quantity, <br />i am thinking just go for it and hope for the best.<br /><br />

				Well I&#039;m a noob also however the name/address things is being and has been debated a lot in these forums. I guess it all depends on how the postal system works in the country or region you are. With the search I&#039;ve done so far if you live somewhere which is a block of apartments or something similar with a shared mailbox then a false name shouldn&#039;t raise any alerts. Now if the post office checks for names also registered to addresses maybe in small communities and such then you might have a problem. A slight misspelling of your name or a different name will blow your plausible deniability away if LE decides to do a controlled delivery and you have the package in your hands. It will basically mean that willingly you tried to hide your name for avoid being charged. If you use your real name, then as long as you keep your mouth closed to the police you will be ok since anyone can send you drugs in mail, doesn&#039;t prove anything. Also domestic orders should be more safe since you put the customs out of the equation. Now I don&#039;t think LE would spend resources for 1gram of weed, or&nbsp; 1gram mdma. The folder which the things will be sent should be small enough to fit in your mailbox. I think the express mail requires signature but not quite sure about that. Maybe someone more experienced in Aus could give you some more details about that.
