				Is it possible that you are mistaking the term &quot;FE&quot; for Feedback, instead of what it stands for, which is &quot;Finalize Early&quot;? You can leave good feedback, but can&#039;t leave good &quot;FE&quot;. You can however, leave good feedback when you Finalize Early, or whenever you finalize, for that matter.<br /><br />If you do Finalize Early, you may not be eligible for any refund if you wanted SR to intervene if there i a problem that you cannot resolve with the vendor. <br /><br />Most vendors will likely be willing to work to resolve a legitimate problem. They want their stats and feedback to be good. If you leave negative feedback then there is less of a chance that they will want to help you, since you have already damaged their reputation (justified or not). <br /><br />If you have &quot;FE&#039;d&quot; - finalized early - already, then you do not have a chance to alter your feedback and rating that you have given to the vendor, good or bad. So when you FE, you really have no choice but to hope the vendor will work to resolve the issue. You have already used up any leverage that you might have had by not finalizing until you actually received the product and were happy with it. Or however it turned out. So be careful. Some vendors want new buyers to FE because there are other vendors that pose as new buyers, place an order with the competition, and then give terrible feedback to undermine their competition. So everybody has to be careful.

				If you do decide to FE, first check the other buyers feedback and ratings to make sure it seems legitimate. Then, i you want to proceed, start very small at first. Don&#039;t risk a lot of money when you have no way to get it back if things don&#039;t work out. After a transaction goes well for both buyer and vendor, hopefully you will not be asked to FE for future orders. Then it is safer to go ahead with larger orders.<br />

Of course, all comments sound like &quot;never arreived&quot;, but feedback are very good. Where is logic?

				I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s just because vendors don&#039;t want anythin&#039; lower than a 5/5. So people put 5/5 but give the honest feedback. Sometimes they&#039;ll blacklist people for givin&#039; under 5/5 if I&#039;m not mistaken.

				There seem to be quite a few vendors who will refuse to sell to you again unless you give a 5/5. So regardless of what happened, the buyer is probably giving a 5/5 just so that they don&#039;t get blacklisted so they can order from that vendor again.<br />I think someone already mentioned this all, but I agree with them when they say that even though the buyer does give a 5/5 to avoid being blacklisted, they still want to leave comments that don&#039;t really reflect this perfect score. They still want to be able to say what happened, and that they are not totally happy. But the fact that they give a 5/5 so that they can place future orders with the vendor tells you that they must not totally blame that vendor either..

				Yes, the buyers might want to buy from that vendor again. If is eventually shows up, they want to have the option of being able to buy from that same person. If it does not, they probably won&#039;t.<br /><br />I would think that if you have not received the order, and the time has run out and you either have to &quot;resolve&quot; it or just let it lapse, you should click the &quot;resolve&quot; option. This process will take a little time and hopefully your item will show up in the mail very soon and that will solve the problem. If not, then you report your experience and follow the process. If you just let it lapse, you may not have any recourse if it never shows up.<br /><br />that being said, this has not happened to me so it would be helpful for someone who has been through this process to share their experience.<br />

				I don&#039;t know if there is a language barrier or something here. But there is no official list of sellers that do this. You have to look at the feedback and decide for yourself. Also, ask people here on this forum about a particular seller if you want to know what other people think. Or search the forums for any posts about that seller. <br /><br />I think that&#039;s all I can really contribute to this topic...<br />

				The moment you finalize early the vendor has no requirement to refund you if something goes wrong, so if you do it at least make sure they are highly trustworthy. And even then, there have been cases when trustworthy vendors have pulled huge FE scams before they retire.<br /><br />If you were referring to feedback, I recommend you always attempt to contact the seller first if you plan to leave anything lower than a 5/5. Most vendors take pride in their feedback and will try and help you out the best they can if an issue arises.

				It&#039;s possible the vendor made that offer in the resolution center, i.e. 100% refund if 5/5 feedback is left.

It was good? <br /><br />Learning to use SR is difficult, there is a lot to learn! When you have a question, search the forum. If you can not find the answer, post the question. There are many people happy to help. <br /><br />Is english your first language? You can PM me if you prefer to answer that in private. <br /><br />As the other posters have said, find a good honest vendor who will not require you to FE / complete the payment. Search the forums to learn who is reliable, with good products. When you receive your goods, make sure you finalize / send the payment immediately. This is fair to the seller. <br /><br />Remember FE means the vendor has your money immediately. If he does not send your product, there is nothing you can do. Silk Road can not help you. The escrow system is your only protection - when you don&#039;t FE, Silk Road holds your funds until you receive the product and finalize the payment - the vendor then receives his payment. Everyone is happy. <br /><br />good luck<br /><br />R

				Also the quality of hash is not good, may be i don&#039;t understand it, but what i tested before, was much better. I think, that hash must be &quot;stronger&quot; as weed, but it&#039;s not so. May be it&#039;s connected with the seller........... :)<br /><br /><br />
