				Call his bluff. I can&#039;t see a dealer going to the cops.. then he&#039;ll leave you alone. Also what&#039;s to stop someone making up addresses, using tor &amp; SR makes it all annonymous, anyone could have sent him your address. Call his bluff and am sure you won&#039;t hear from him again!

				obviously, do not finalize!<br />there is really not much that can be done about things like that, but the admins of any marketplace/forum will sure react accordingly.<br />and the police isn&#039;t interested in info like that anyway - first they aren&#039;t interested in customers, <br />and they also can&#039;t just break down on some presumed vendors just because of some obscure &amp; anonymous black(e)mail (i&#039;m pretty confident that they get a lot of those)<br />as of now, we are still living in a due-process society, so don&#039;t worry
