				Hi guys, <br /><br />I am newbie. I want to know if it is safe to buy weed to be shipped to Brazil. I wonder if i should ask for a register letter and if i should put my real name on it. <br /><br />Should i ask to be delivery at my real place? I am afraid that the box get scanned by the post office and/or the police, and they send it anyways to me to wait for me to get the packege. You feel me?<br /><br />I dont know if you usually buy or sell to Brazil but if you do, does it usually works well?<br /><br />Brazilian weed suck as heel. I cannot stand it anymore!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />

				Hi there,<br /><br />You have a better chance of getting weed through internationally if it is coming from a respected country like the UK, where the customs aren&#039;t looking for packages coming from so much because it is not seen as a country that exports cannabis. <br /><br />Unlike Canada or Holland, which are known by customs as major exporters of cannabis. <br /><br /><br />Try placing an order for some of my weed, you&#039;ll be certain it will get to you no problem. <br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Walter

				having lived there for years, I wouldn&#039;t risk it to be honest. I know the weed there sucks but i have, on many occasions, had packages from relatives opened up, something inside removed, package resealed then delivered.<br /><br />Sometimes it&#039;s chocolate, sometimes a CD, sometimes it&#039;s just something of value. Brazilian customs are just a bunch of crooks. they might not prosecute you for the stuff, but you might just get an empty box.

				Hey,<br /><br />yes, yhey might open it and take something to them. But this is a risk that i would face it. The real problem for me it to get caught by the police. You know how police are here and they could come to my place and ask for money, etc.. but i think i will try it. I am not a dealer i just want to smoke good weed so i ding it worht the risk!<br />hehe<br /><br />thank you!<br /><br />

				With customs going through your shit, you&#039;d have a much better chance of something like cheebachews, or even amber glass BHO hash going through unnoticed. Especially if the stealth is done right. Cookies? Gotta think of something the crooks will leave alone if they discover. Personally, if I were rummaging around someone&#039;s mail I wouldn&#039;t eat anything that looked like food. Maybe they won&#039;t either!
