				Send the order into resolution and within a few days you will receive some guidance on the issue. You will have an opportunity to explain what&#039;s up. If he doesn&#039;t come through they will probably refund you your money as long as you didn&#039;t FE.

I ordered from him the Friday before last, on May 10th, and it was marked &quot;in transit&quot; on Monday the 13th, but I ain&#039;t seen shit. It was &quot;express&quot; too, which he charges $31 for, but as far as I know all USPS express envelopes are sold using a flat rate of $19.95. Regardless, I&#039;ve lost hope that he is going to come through, its just been too long and he&#039;s acting too shady. Charlie must be thrivin after rippin so many people off!

				Charlie has done this exact same shady tactic MULTIPLE times before. Why he has not been banned yet is beyond me. I can find a dozen threads, new and old, referring to this exact same scenario. I&#039;ve seen a dozen users on the forums who, just like me, had their order marked In Transit on the 13th and have received nothing. Look at his recent feedback, a bunch of customers who FE&#039;d are editing their feedback to 1/5 and stating that their order never came.<br /><br />He marked all of his remaining orders In Transit on the 13th, apparently shipped a handful of them, and ripped the rest of us off. It&#039;s time to get rid of him once and for all. I recommend that all of you, whether you&#039;ve finalized or not, click the &quot;Report This Vendor&quot; button. The more people that report him, put their orders into resolution, and spread the word that he is a scammer, the better chance we have of getting our money back that is rightfully ours. <br /><br />Someone who has been established as an obvious scammer should not be allowed to operate any longer. Like I said, he&#039;s done this multiple times before, he knows what he&#039;s doing. No more customers money tied up in escrow for two weeks, no more early finalizers ending up with nothing, no more users getting ripped off and scammed when he inevitably comes back and does the same thing again.<br /><br />Please, ban this fucker already.

				I made the same mistake and FE&#039;d. Marked in transit the 13th. Never received. I guess I learned my lesson the hard way. The thing is, right when his feedback was about to get below 90, there where 5 mysterious new reviews that all gave him 5/5. Two said &quot;good&quot; and that&#039;s it, one actually had a message, and the other two where blank, looks pretty fishy to me.

				In the same boat as everyone else that recently ordered with CharlieMustThrive.&nbsp; Thankfully I did not FE and only have a day or two longer until the resolve option is available.&nbsp; My question is my buyer stats are flawless and I would like to keep it this way.&nbsp; Is there anyway to resolve this without my stats taking a hit?&nbsp; Don&#039;t think anyone should be punished since this dick decided to run off.&nbsp; Thanks.

				If any of the people that have left CharlieMustThrive feedback above a 1 and were also scammed by him read this, please do the rest of us a favor (the ones that got fucked by CMT) and change your feedback score to a 1. If CMT doesn&#039;t get banned then you are only supporting his behavior. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few people have expressed sympathy for CMT in their feedback by saying that they hope that nothing bad has happened to him. I too hope nothing bad has happened to him, but if it weren&#039;t for the honest feedback people have left for CMT in the past, we would not have been able to point out that this is repeat behavior from CMT. This routine is exactly that, a routine, or a pattern that he has already been called out on. So I would be wary of giving CMT the benefit of the doubt when this is the 2nd or 3rd go around where he has fucked his customers out of their money and then apologized about it afterwards only to be able to continue it again in the future. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My order is currently in resolution and will go under SR review in less than 20 hours, at which point I am hoping to get a full refund. I have been a member on SR for 9 months, with 70 transactions and this order with CMT will be the first one to blemish my record. CMT may or may not get banned, but I will walk away from this a little less trusting, a little more frustrated, and with a mark against me on my &quot;Purchasing Statistics&quot;. So at the very least I am going to be honest in the feedback I leave for CMT, and hopefully I&#039;ll be able to lower his vendor rating by leaving him a 1 in hopes that it will be a red flag to potential buyers if CMT does manage to worm his way back into the game.

				I too had an open order with this moron. He marked it in transit the very same day I ordered it, then went rogue immediately after. Fortunately I didn&#039;t FE, but I feel for those who did that trusted him. Also, SR staff has been awesome to everyone it seems - my buyer stats weren&#039;t affected (still at no refund rate) so they must think Charlie is fucking us purposely.

				UPDATE: This stupid asshole just logged in today after nearly a month of being gone. Wonder what he&#039;s up to - probably seeing how many FE&#039;s were cashed out to him and shipping out his bitcoins to another wallet. Scamming piece of shit.<br /><br />Whatever happens, we can&#039;t forgive him just to let him return to his sloppy game. We deserve better.

				The fact that the reviews for this vendor have suddenly stopped coming in on the very same day he logs back in is also VERY suspicious to me. It seems as though the last resolution passed through some time last night. And now he&#039;s back on? Almost as if he&#039;s been keeping track of the days and buyers he was trying to scam.

				Got bit by this guy (didn&#039;t FE so I&#039;m not out any coins, thankfully).&nbsp; However I think maybe SR should implement some sort of auto/temp ban mechanism where if a vendor loses a certain number of resolution disputes in a certain amount of time, is banned for a time period or at least until they can offer an explanation of what&#039;s going on or something.
