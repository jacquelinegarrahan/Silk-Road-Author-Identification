				So I got my first Heroin off top_notch on SR. I&#039;ve never tried it before. Because I don&#039;t live alone I am nervous about trying it. I share the house with two house mates and I want my little experience to pass unnoticed. For this reason, I will just stay while it happens, probably at night and see how it goes. <br /><br />So, how long is a heroin high supposed to last? I want to smoke a very small amount, so that the high be pretty short lived. But how small is a small amount for a first time opiate user? A pinpoint size? A pea size? I don&#039;t have a scales.<br /><br />Also, is it possible that the Heroin high make me paranoid or out of control in my behaviour? I want to appear &quot;normal&quot; to my house mates if I have to interact with them while I&#039;m high. I don&#039;t want to be skipping and jumping ecstatically through the house (like I did when I tried ecstacy for the first time).

				You aren&#039;t likely to be &#039;skipping&#039; on heroin. More likely you will feel pretty laid back, maybe even &#039;nodding&#039;. It&#039;s a really hard drug, and you definitely don&#039;t want to overdose. Be very careful and start very small. You can always take another chase at the dragon, but you can&#039;t undo it once you have smoked too much. I have never felt too paranoid on heroin. I even did some (snorted) at work a few times back in the day. I had a job that I just sat around on a computer, and didn&#039;t have to interact with people.<br /><br />Try looking at Erowid for more info, or search the harm reduction section here for more info. Be safe, and hopefully you have fun. Remember too that this shit is very addictive...<br /><br />JJ

				being paranoid makes you paranoid. drugs make you high. you might not be paranoid if you stay cool, but you will be high. it depends on how well your housemates know your regular behavior, and how you react to being high on said substance. it would be better to not be around people that will make you paranoid while trying out a drug for the first time
