				I just logged into SR, and read the security announcement on the front page. The NSA/FBI have successfully taken down TorMail, which worries me. The feds HATE SR, and it is obvious that they&#039;re closing in on us TOR users. I&#039;m worried that Silk Road is on its last legs, because LE is making progress against us. <br /><br />My question is, how safe does everyone think SR still is? I&#039;m hesitant to use it now, as the TorMail server being taken down has me sketched out about LE and TOR.&nbsp; Is SR still safe to use? And if so, for how much longer? I would love to see it thrive for years to come, but this recent seizure has me worried that we will not be seeing SR for much longer.<br /><br />Opinions? I dearly hope I&#039;m just being paranoid, and SR is as secure as ever.

				That worries me. I love and depend on SR, as I live in an area where drugs are not easy to find.<br /><br />Well, we can only hope and pray SR stays alive and strong.<br /><br />Even if it does go down, I suppose there&#039;s other marketplaces (Black Market Reloaded, for example) that we can use, but man, would that be a pain in the ass.

				Tormail wasn&#039;t busted. The owner and founder of Freedom Hosting was arrested and anyone or anything that was running their website under FH is in deep trouble but sophisticated sites like Silkroad run off their own dedicated servers and what not..so you don&#039;t have to worry.

Hearing FH got popped was/is very worrisome, as I frequently used TorMail. They&#039;re trying hard to come after SR, and I&#039;m just wondering how long it will be before they succeed. :/
