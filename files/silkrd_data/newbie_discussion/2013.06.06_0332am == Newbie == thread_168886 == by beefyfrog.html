				Hello all. I have recently discovered the 8th wonder. The SR. I made a purchase yesterday for 3 different items from 3 different vendors. I was hesitant to order, my only means to SR is on my phone and I havent been able to figure out how to use pgp. I did message each seller prior to purchase and they told me it wasnt a problem of I order without pgp but I should really learn it. My question is, does anyone else purchase through their phone? Have you figured out a way to use pgp? Also all 3 of my order are still processing 30 hours after purchase. is that normal since they are all domestic usa? Thamk you and I look forward to hearing from you!

				You can access SR on your phone?&nbsp; Tor runs on Android/IOS?&nbsp; Please tell me you weren&#039;t using&nbsp; onion.to<br /><br />There are guides for learning PGP on here and elsewhere.&nbsp; It is complicated, but once you get the hang of it you&#039;ll think it isn&#039;t that bad.&nbsp;

				I use orbot. The only way I have been able to use tor is after rooting my phone. And I have read alot of different pgp tutorials and nothing works on android. And there seems to be no information anywhere on this. Theres no way in hell im the only person using sr on my phone..... right?? What do you mean using onion.to?

				there exists a gateway to the hidden .onion sites.&nbsp; Instead of whatever.onion (while running Tor) you can enter whatever.onion.to from the clearnet and still get to where you want to go.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried it, but it defeats the whole idea of hidden services, you don&#039;t want your ISP or whoever knowing where you go while on Tor.<br /><br />It took me a while to figure out PGP, even though its been around since the early 90&#039;s or whatever.&nbsp; There&#039;s different implementations with different interfaces, some are better than others.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what to suggest for a rooted phone.&nbsp;

				Had me paranoid for a minute lol. Orbot is a legit app to access tor and hidden services. I cant even access clearnet sites when orbot is running. It sends me to a Google page saying something about blocking because I might be sending automated queries. It even sets up a transparent proxy. I have no idea what that means but it sounds deluxe.
