				Does anyone else go batshit crazy with worry of LE swooping in and searching the house while waiting for an order/when order has finally been delivered? Call me crazy, but I worry my ASS off. I have been reading WAY too many controlled delivery stories...at first, I thought I was golden as long as there wasn&#039;t anyone knocking at the door wanting a damn signature for the package but THEN I started reading all of the stories about LE bugging the package with beacons and tracking devices...that scares the fuck out of me! Anyone else get a bit nervous, and does anyone have any advice to detect such controlled deliveries and avoid trouble? I&#039;ve ordered to a different address each time I have ordered (I was fortunate to be traveling to different states and moving), and I used my maiden last name and only an initial for the first for all orders. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the vendor I used this time doesn&#039;t seem to be very honest with his shipping times (second time ordering with them, but they owed me some shit that was missing in the last order or I&#039;d have ordered with someone else). Judging from feedback and my experience, although they gets mostly 5&#039;s they probably shouldn&#039;t be because they will mark things as being shipped when they aren&#039;t. For example, I ordered something on one day last month and I didn&#039;t receive it for 4 days...it wasn&#039;t actually mailed out until the day before I had gotten it, according to the postage, and I had paid extra for express. The vendor said it was shipped although it wasn&#039;t...to top it off, it was short almost half the order&nbsp; :o <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had an issue with other orders when ordering express, both on and off SR. My problem, aside from my housemates possibly answering the door to a fucking controlled delivery) is having no way of knowing if my shipment is taking slightly longer then it should be because I have no clue when the fuck it has been actually shipped! How are we, as buyers, supposed to have a fucking clue if we SHOULD worry when we have no way of knowing if something was truly shipped or not? Every case of controlled delivery I&#039;ve read about had one thing in common, and that was a delayed delivery.

				Get a P.O. box. Then take precautions when checking it. Don&#039;t show up every day at the same time. Or on the same day of the week every week. Things like these help. If your really paranoid stake out the post office 36 hrs prior to checking your box. That way you&#039;re already there watching when the people show up to watch you.

I&#039;ve had a package or two picked up by customs over the years and I just got a love letter from them.<br /><br />And, if you&#039;re busted, you&#039;re busted.&nbsp; So if it&#039;s in the mail, don&#039;t worry.

				thank you so much for the advice...I actually have a PO box already but wasn&#039;t sure if it would be a good idea to use it for that purpose or not, but now I see where it would definitely be something to look into...I considered upgrading to a bigger box so I wouldn&#039;t have to deal with a slip and speaking with anyone at the counter to retrieve my goods :)
