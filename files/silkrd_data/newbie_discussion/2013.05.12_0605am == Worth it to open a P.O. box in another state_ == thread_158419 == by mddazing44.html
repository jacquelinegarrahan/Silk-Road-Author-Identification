				I&#039;ll probably post this in another board when i get to 50, but i might as well just ask it in the meantime: I&#039;m in a non weed friendly state but i&#039;m not far at all from a state where it&#039;s decriminalized. I&#039;m going to get a P.O. box either way, so would it be worth it to open one in a weed friendly state or would i be fucked either way if i&#039;m caught? Also, if i plan on not getting an more than 7g of weed, would an x-small PO box be fine?

If you are a minor, though, I would make the futile recommendation that you log off this site and don&#039;t return until you are of majority age. That said, and assuming that you are, in fact, of age to be a consenting adult, here is the answer to your question:<br /><br />Sending and receiving drugs in the mail is a federal offense - a felony. You will be charged by the postal service with trafficking if they find the amount worthwhile enough to do a controlled delivery. It doesn&#039;t matter what state you&#039;re in; on the federal level (which is what we&#039;re tampering with here, folks, the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE), marijuana is illegal. Most adults know this, which is why I went on that initial tangent about you possibly being a minor. Another reason I thought you were a minor is that, based on your post (and I might be wrong on this, but this is what your post indicates), you don&#039;t know what &quot;decriminalization&quot; means. It does not mean &quot;legalization&quot; by ANY means. If you are found in possession of marijuana in a decriminalized state, and you do not have a perscription from a licensed physician, you are likely going to your local jail where you will await charges, which will likely be that of a felony or perhaps multiple felonies (if you were distributing). So no, it would likely not make any difference if you get a PO Box in another state, since it would be the federal government that would charge you with any crimes you would be found committing through use of the US postal service.<br /><br />I hope that puts things in perspective. And, again, I would recommend you log off this site if you are a minor. If you are not, please do what you can to educate yourself - pretend like you don&#039;t think you&#039;re invincible and won&#039;t get beaten to a pulp in a jail/prison setting. It is not fun to be there. You don&#039;t want to go there. Be safe.

I&#039;m just on summer break. Also, i understand that decriminalization does not mean that it&#039;s legal. In the state that I&#039;m talking about, possession under a certain amount is just a civil offense.<br /><br />With that being said, your trafficking statement scared me even more. Would they really consider 7g enough to warrant a controlled delivery? The thing that scares me about a PO box is that they don&#039;t seem to go about doing a controlled delivery the same way that they would do it at a house, but i would never want to have my parents house flagged which is why i don&#039;t plan on having it sent there.
