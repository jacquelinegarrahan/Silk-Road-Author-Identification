				I went through the trouble of signing up for Mt Gox on public wifi, preparing a Bitinstant transaction, and driving to three different CVS stores before finding one that did Moneygram and after giving them a fake name and address, they asked for ID. I walked out. Are there certain stores that don&#039;t ask for ID? I&#039;m in the states.

				Find a walmart and go about it through them.&nbsp; That&#039;s what worked for me.&nbsp; I filled out the moneygram slip, waited in line, handed it over, she put all the info in the computer, asked for the money, and gave me a receipt.&nbsp; No questions were asked.

				HEY!<br />I normally go to CVS too. I always use the same fake info, whenever they ask for my ID I just say I don&#039;t have one. They then either read my name off the screen (because I&#039;m usually the only pending Moneygram transaction at the moment) OR they just ask me what my name is. I&#039;ve never been declined yet. I actually just made a deposit earlier today. When I told they guy I didn&#039;t have ID I could tell he was unsure how to continue, so I just told him my name and he put it through.<br /><br />Honestly, I would just recommend going back another time when someone else is working. Most of the employees could care less if you have ID or not, at least in my experience. You might have just gotten that one guy...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I happened to get the assistant manager who likely takes his job seriously plus I ended up in a really nice part of town after trying more local stores. I think I&#039;ll just try Walmart. Their employees are less likely to give a shit.
