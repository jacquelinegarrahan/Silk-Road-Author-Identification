				So I have a Bitcoin wallet and an SR wallet. I want to make a deposit in cash since it&#039;s the most secure way I feel. Do I need to use some kind of service to deposit them or what?<br />Thanks

				I got bitcoins today, which has been one of the most turmoilsous days in bitcoins for the past few months - My turnaround was less than 4 hours. <br /><br />bitfloor.com <br /><br />Signed up this morning, set up a cash deposit, and printed out a slip. <br /><br />Walked into Bank of America down the road, filled out a deposit slip and handed over cash. Got back home, logged in and saw that the money was acknowledged received, however bitfloor was done (as well as many other bitcoin sites off and on), but once it was up the funds were available, and I was able to sit there and wait till I felt comfortable, and threw up a buy order, which was quickly executed. <br /><br />The site went up and down a few more times, they acknowledged on the website there were holding errors but were working on it. A few hours later, the cash that was being held from the purchase got changed into bitcoins. I did a transfer out to my public wallet, and they showed up an hour later. <br /><br />From what I hear, it should not take that long - but today was out of the ordinary. <br /><br />I tried bitinstant yesterday, and did not like the delays either, and as soon as they got the cash they processed the bitcoins. Which is all well and good, unless it&#039;s a volatile market and you sorta want to plan your entry point, which makes bitfloor better. On top of that, when you do a moneygram, they want to know quite a bit of personal information. bah. <br /><br />Long story short, bitfloor seemed the best, if you got a Bank of America location near you - no account necessary.

				I can&#039;t use bitfloor because there aren&#039;t any deposit stations near me. Are there any other good services to use?

				another option is localbitcoins.com, you can search by region for someone selling bitcoins.&nbsp; you&#039;ll make the offer, their bitcoins will go into escrow, you&#039;ll be provided with bank acct info, and you&#039;ll need to deposit in their bank.&nbsp; if you see that you dont have that bank near you, you can cancel the offer.&nbsp;

				Coinbase. I wouldn&#039;t call this the MOST secure way but a secure and easily accessible way nevertheless.<br />there&#039;s also an app on your phone. You can use your credit card and such but takes literally like a week.<br />But you get the coins for the price you paid when you made the order.

				Oh how I miss ArumXchange&#039;s cash deposit policy. Probably created the least paper trail possible, outside of mining your own coins I suppose. Sad those days are gone :(.

And do they do cash deposits?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MtGox doesn&#039;t do any deposits themselves (unless you want to do a direct bank transfer, and show some ID) they instead rely on a host of various 3ed parties who all like to take a little chunk of what you are paying. The payment services don&#039;t take cash deposits (at least not that I can see, again I miss ArumXchange when they had them), but most have some sort of wire system set up. BitInstant, contrary to what they claim, doen&#039;t do cash deposits but instead uses the MoneyGram wire system, which requires some ID. <br /><br />And is MtGox any good? Well they do about 80% of the BTC sales, so they are the best option for some. There are people here on the road that offer cash to BTC exchange services, and you can decide yourself if you want to risk it. Never used anything but MtGox myself, but I have never had a problem with them.

				BitInstant supports cash deposits through moneygram, with a 3.99% fee + $3.95 per transaction. You can deposit into mtgox or straight to a bitcoin address. If you deposit into mtgox, you get US dollars, not bitcoins. This means you can do the exchange when the exchange rate suits you.<br /><br />If you deposit at Wal-Mart, ID is NOT currently required. At CVS they WILL ask for ID for sure. If you want to make up fake info, use Walmart, obviously.&nbsp; You WILL need a phone number though. You could use a Google voice number tied to a disposable cell. Ideally, make up fake info and remember it in case they ask you some simple question during the transaction. Write it down and re-use the same fake info for at least a while... <br /><br />BitInstant will work over TOR, but I THINK doing so will cause your account to get locked pending proof of ID soon, and you&#039;ll have to create all new info. A better choice is to use a public wireless network. Don&#039;t try and access your MTGOX account over TOR either.<br /><br /><br />:::: Too bad I don&#039;t know shit about SR and Bitcoins, and am stuck working off my &quot;newbie&quot; status by posting 50 times -&nbsp; I&#039;d ignore all that crap above if I were you!&nbsp; ::::

				they don&#039;t necessarily have a fee they tack on top<br />but they just charge a little extra than the current rates<br />its not that much and also a way better deal than bitinstant or MtGOx
