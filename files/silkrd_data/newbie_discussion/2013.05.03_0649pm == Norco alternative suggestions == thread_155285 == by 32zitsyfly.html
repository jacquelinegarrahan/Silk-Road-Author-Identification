				I have a quick question I&#039;m hoping that some knowledgeable people can answer.<br /><br />To anyone that has taken Norcos knows the feeling you get where all your cares go away and also have a lot of energy and then sleep great. It&#039;s a fantastic feeling but, Norcos have that ingredient that is not good for you. <br />My question is....is there anything out there that you can take where you get that same feeling but doesn&#039;t have the acetaminophen in it?<br />Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Also, if you prefer, you can send me a PM<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				You can give Kratom a shot.&nbsp; It is legal in everywhere in the US except for Indiana and Tennessee.&nbsp; You have to be careful b/c a lot of places like head shops are selling stuff called Kratom but it is laced.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do a search for Kratom on your regular browser and do some reading.&nbsp; I find it to be very similar.<br /><br />If you want some reputable vendors that you can order from, shoot me a PM.

				You could look into cold water extraction. I&#039;ve never done it myself, but looked into it when I had some vics awhile back because I too was concerned about taking too much acetaminophen.<br /><br />It&#039;s a relatively simple process from what I remember. I think it&#039;s something along the lines of: you crush the pills and put them in cold water (in the fridge) over night. The steps beyond this are beyond me. Somehow you are able to separate the hydrocodone from the acetaminophen using cold water.<br /><br />Look up cold water extraction, I know there are some guides out there.

				oxycodone (not percocet) will have a similar effect, without tylenol.<br />kratom can be similar.<br />DHC is slightly similar, i find it less painkilling and more stoning.<br />most opiates are kind of similar, they just have different levels of euphoria vs dopiness vs energy vs numbness...<br /><br />or try cold water extraction. add cold water to your FINELY POWDERED pills. (you can use a plastic baggie and a rolling pin or cup to crush them.) mix well. strain through a coffee filter. throw out the powder gunk, it&#039;s acetaminophen. drink the water, that&#039;s your hydrocodone. it can be around 80-95% of your hydro extracted if you do it well. you can repeat the process with the powder gunk before you throw it out if you want for the most extraction possible. make sure you use COLD water, acetaminophen dissolves in hot water.
