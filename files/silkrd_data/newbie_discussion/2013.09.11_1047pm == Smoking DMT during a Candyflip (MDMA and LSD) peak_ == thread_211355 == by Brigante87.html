				smoking DMT on a pure Acid-peak, is something you should have tried.<br />But not really sure about MDMA peaking and DMT.. i always had good experiences with both, but a lot of people being high on MDMA-peaking, and smoking DMT complsined sbout, feeling bad in stomach, started sweating a lot, etc... LSD+DMT = love it..<br />MDMA-peak+DMT: would say its not the best combination

				I&#039;m surprised, having never taking a psychedelic, i always assumed you are just in another world for a couple hours. i&#039;m surprised at &#039;peak&#039; you could make a decision to ingest more drugs.

				Damm, sounds like one hell of a trip! I wouldn&#039;t recommend it though(I don&#039;t have any experience myself) but it sounds a bit over the top.

				@kermitine - when you set a candyflip, you should start with LSD first, that&#039;s the combination I know, LSD always comes first when mixing it with other drugs. You take other drugs while being on acid. Smoking weed while being on acid rocks, MDMA....hell yeah!!!<br />But to add DMT to IT? WOW!? What an idea, I haven&#039;t tried dmt in my life, but still know pretty much about it, it is crazy! I couldn&#039;t dream of what possibly might happen...Seriously psychonaut, out of space experience to handle! A challenge!
