				Heyho,<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen this incredible offer on SR, 1/2 lb mid grade commercial weed&nbsp; for about 250€ ^^<br />At the one hand I think i shouldn&#039;t order because I think packets from Mexico get more often controlled then something I offer somewhere in the EU or domestic, but on the other hand it just would be free money for me^^<br />Enough people are asking me if I can get them some for 10€/g and they would still buy it even it isn&#039;t a good quality. 1/2 lb ~ 225g*10€-250€ = 2000€<br />2000€ would be a nice bonus pay to my poor apprenticeship wage^^.<br />What do you guys think about ordering such amounts from Mexico to Germany via Silkroad?<br />What would be the worse case? Losing my 1/2 lb, right? I mean everyone can send everything via post...<br /><br />Kind regards<br /><br />ichbins :)

				If you&#039;re talking about La Fuente you should read his review thread and decide for yourself. Results seem to be mixed but quite a few people are not receiving as of late.

				If the package doesn&#039;t arrive ok... 250€ for nothing but thats not the reason I hesitate to order.<br />Is nobody here who can tell me whats the procedure if such amounts of marihuana gets discovered in a package/letter adressed to you or does it depend where it gets discovered? (in Germany)<br />Or do you maybe have any tips how I can order the most safety way?

				i wouldn&#039;t advise it. his orders are taking over a month if they show up at all. plus that&#039;s a hell of a lot to be importing from a somewhat dodgy location, if customs catch it i highly doubt they&#039;ll send you a friendly letter. more likely police or controlled delivery. look up your local laws and jail time for possession with intent to distribute, trafficking/importation... look for news articles of people getting busted receiving by mail. i&#039;d have a look but my deutsch ist nicht so gut. surely there&#039;s dutch vendors on here selling bulk you could still profit from and the shipping time will be a lot faster.

				hmm, ok thanks for the awnsers - I won&#039;t do it,<br />the time isn&#039;t the problem I&#039;d wait also 2 month to get 1g/€ ^^<br />The only thing I couldn&#039;t stand would be any stress with police or anything like that... I&#039;d like to keep my police record clean ;) and if you guys mean that theres a real chance that the police gets involved with the package I won&#039;t do it<br />Danke Ron Swanson ;)
