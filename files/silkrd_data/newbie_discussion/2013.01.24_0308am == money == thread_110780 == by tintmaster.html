				What if the price is a great deal lower but the quality of work is excellant doesnt this usually cause a problem with other vendors whom have the same goods.i am just asking i would like to know is there enough to make it worth my while in exchanges and does it take a long time to peddle your wares

				everything on SR is a higher price than in reel life, in the UK anyway :)) SR just lets people order drugs without dealing with shady characters or people who they might not want to aproach. alot of people dont actualy know drug dealers so getting it from the internet is perfect for them

				As a guess I can imagine theres a lot of extra costs involved with selling on sr and the non exhaustive list that I can think of are <br />Vendors account <br />Security costs vpn etc <br />Packaging <br />Fuel costs to post in different places <br />Possibly a small tranaction fee <br />Safely converting your btc anonymously to local currency (who knows what that could be or how. Info like that sells on SR)<br />As well a laundering costs depending on thee scale of your op. <br /><br />Im only a buyer but hopefully iv been of some help. When you hit 50 posts ask again in the main forum and theres tons of incredibly knowledgeable senior memebers like limitless and nomadbloodbath to name a few that seem willing to answer any and all questions about things you want to knowas well as things you dont

				The items I am familiar with&nbsp; are priced high compared to RL. Why? The time and cost involved to package and mail adds up especially on small quantities if you do it in a secure (right) way. It truly is a lot of work labor wise. That said some of the &quot;top&quot; quality product is usually crazy high imo.

				it&#039;s just supply and demand. you may think you have plenty of product but at the end of the day you can only send so much of it out. this may seem like it&#039;s not a limiting factor, but if you were to try to sell adderall on here for what you may find it on the streets for you will soon be so inundated with small orders that you&#039;d have to either seek out help (a risk for you),&nbsp; raise your prices, or sell in larger quantities. I&#039;d say there are only a few drugs on SR that have unreasonably high prices- the rest have fairly strong market forces keeping those prices high.

				i find the cannabis prices here quite reasonable. MMJ is going for $450/oz in michigan.....i cant really speak to the prices of other goods as i only enjoy them on a personal level but what i have received (yayo, molly, concentrates,edibles) have been on point with some of the best IRL and ive been down 4 the cause for 30yrs!<br />i saw 0.6g being passed for a teener tonight at $100...and people bought them. myself included. imagine my disappointment when i got home. good stuff but REALLY light. so SR in my mind is the schnizit
