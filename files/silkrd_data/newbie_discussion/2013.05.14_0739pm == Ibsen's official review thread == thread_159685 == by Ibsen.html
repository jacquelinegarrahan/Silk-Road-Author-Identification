				I got my first order from Ibsen today and can nothing but recommend this vendor! Really fast delivery, good communication and the product is as real as it gets. In Norway we would say &quot;Løp og Kjøp!&quot;.

				I&#039;m awaiting some samples from Ibsen. He is very friendly and helpful to talk with, very happy with the communication. Also it&#039;s nice to see more products being available on the norwegian market. :) <br /><br />I will be back with reviews when the products arrive and I have had the time to test them :)

				Ordered 2C-b and M!, never tried either of those before, despite being a fan of MDMA and psychedelics. Pleasantly surprised of the effects of both. Thought i felt i needed a higher dose of M1 than Erowid &quot;suggested&quot;. But it&#039;s probably just me that like going over the top&nbsp; :D<br /><br />But, great vendor, quick delivery, great product, 5/5 <br /><br />I just hope, for more psychedelics&nbsp; :)&nbsp; :)

				Welcome Ibsen! While I am not into RCs or Ketamine, I just wanted to tell you that you may want to look at other prices your products go for on the road, because right now, you aren&#039;t even competing. Methylone goes for $20-30 a gram, Ketamine 30-50, and your prices are 3 or 4 times that. Good luck!

I provide good products more or less risk free for my customers. Many of my customers don&#039;t need the attention of any drug shipments crossing the boarder. It&#039;s expensive compared to other countries, but compared to the Norwegian street prices it&#039;s a steal. I compete with Norwegian vendors, and do offer products they don&#039;t provide, and I offer lower prices then my domestic competition.<br /><br />For example, I now offer 2g of pure MDMA for 200 bucks, which is the double amount of MD for the same price as 1g at your local dealer.&nbsp;

				I didn&#039;t have the time to test the 2C-B and methylone samples before this weekend. I know I promised you a review, and I&#039;m sorry it took so long. I&#039;m going to post the reviews here tomorrow :)

				Here comes my magical review of Ibsens 2C-B :)<br /><br />I received 20 mg of 2C-B as a sample from Ibsen. First I thought about snorting it, but after the reading on the internet about it having one of the worst nose burns a drug can give, I decided to mix it in a glass of water instead. I&#039;m glad I did, licking of some powder that was stuck on the tape the bag was sealed with left my tongue very numb, and it had a very bitter taste.&nbsp; Because of the very bitter taste and numbing properties I guess the powder is very pure and good quality. <br /><br />Around 45 minutes after I drank the water with 2C-B I started feeling a little nauseous. I also started feeling a bit weird, but I had no &quot;come up&quot; feeling at all. Time went by, and I became much more nauseous. I tried to lay down, but it didn&#039;t really help too much, so I decided to go to the toilet and try to puke to get rid of the nausea for all. I didn&#039;t manage to puke no matter how far down my throat I stuck my fingers. At least I knew I wouldn&#039;t throw up in my bed by accident... <br /><br />I laid down again trying to wait the nausea out. I was feeling kind of weird, it was more like the headspace of MDMA than of LSD, and it didn&#039;t feel like I was tripping at all. Except from the nausea I felt quite relaxed and chilled out in my mind. I tried to listen to some music, and it was pretty awesome. My thoughts and imagination became much more abstract than normal, and weird and funny thoughts flowed trough my mind. An hour went by and the nausea was still there but less intense. As long as I didn&#039;t move to much it didn&#039;t bother me that much. I tried to watch a movie and it was much more awesome than movies normally are. I often like to watch romantic comedies when I&#039;m tripping (I usually hate them) because of the nice and friendly atmosphere and (often) hot chicks. I watched &quot;crazy stupid love&quot; and fell in love with Emma Stone. She is fucking hot (at least on 2C-B). I masturbated twice in a row (within 10 minutes) and it felt awesome both times. (I&#039;ve never ever been able to masturbate 2 times in a row before) First time dedicated to Emma Stone, and the second to good old porn. 2C-B definitely has an erotic side, and I&#039;ve earlier read Shulgin&#039;s quote&nbsp; “If there is ever an effective aphrodisiac, it will probably be modelled after 2C-B.”. I think he&#039;s right.<br /><br />The effects slowly and smoothly disappeared until I felt completely sober. It didn&#039;t give me any &quot;come down&quot; feeling, and it had no after effects except trouble sleeping, something I always get on psychedelics. I would really like to try 2C-B again, as it feels like I&#039;ve just scratched the surface of this drug. The dose was basically to low for me orally to really get much effect, so next time I would either try 40mg or plug it instead. The nausea was quite annoying, but I think I can avoid it in the future by not eating the hours before tripping or taking in rectally. I ate a normal size meal 2 hour before taking the drug. I&#039;ve never been nauseous from psychedelics before so I didn&#039;t really think too much about it. Lesson learned.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks to Ibsen for sending me this sample :) He seem like a very friendly and helpful vendor, and gave me much good information about use, dosage and safety by private message when ordering. Package arrived after a short amount of time and everything went very smooth. I was surprised to see that the free sample of methylone was a whole gram and not just one user dosage. This was enough for both me and my friend to have an extremely good time :) He also gave me 200mg of pure MDMA I didn&#039;t even order for free, which was a really nice surprise. <br /><br />I&#039;m giving Ibsen 5/5 as a vendor so far. It&#039;s nice to have a vendor like you domestically. I like your taste in drugs. ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m writing the review methylone tomorrow, as it took longer time than planned to write... :)
