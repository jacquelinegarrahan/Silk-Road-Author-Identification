				Hi,<br />I had an established vendor ask me to FE on an international transaction. The product should have arrived now. The vendor&#039;s page looks like it is in holiday mode. Messages sent asking for update or tracking number (item marked sent) haven&#039;t been read or replied to. How can I send this to SR admin for resolution? Support ticket? Obviously I can&#039;t click resolve on my orders page as the Tx has been finalized.<br />Thanks for any assistance you can offer.<br />PW

				I don&#039;t think there is much SR could do, once it&#039;s been finalized it&#039;s basically out of their hands.&nbsp; If others are having the same problem or your sure there is foul play at work then I think your only recourse is to report the vendor.

				I&#039;ve never actually had post go missing.<br /><br />The only time I didn&#039;t get an order was when it was never sent in the first place.<br /><br />I only FE&#039;d one of those times.

You could start a thread naming the vendor to see if anyone else has not received. This may help others who haven&#039;t Fe&#039;d but you are going to have to suck it up I&#039;m afraid.

				You won&#039;t get any support from SR on this transaction since you have already finalized it.&nbsp; Finalizing your order should only be done AFTER you&#039;ve received the order and are happy with it.&nbsp; Since you&#039;ve already released the funds from escrow before receiving your order, there&#039;s nothing SR can or will do for you.<br /><br />Please read the forums and note that we always advise that you STAY IN ESCROW, which is there for your protection!
