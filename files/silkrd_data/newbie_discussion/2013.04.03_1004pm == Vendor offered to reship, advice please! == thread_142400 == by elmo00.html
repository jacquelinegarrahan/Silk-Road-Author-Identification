				I have an order in the resolution center, and my vendor had a refund policy that guaranteed a 50% refund after a 15 day extension. Now I would like to order from him again since he is trusted, however, I have been asked to finalize the payment with the promise of a reshippment. I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that for a couple of reasons. One being that I would like to pay him since I am sure that the package was sent and secondly because it seems sketch. <br /><br />Is this usually done? How can I tactfully ask for a refund instead of a reshippment (without proof of an order)?

				I would make your point clear to an admin in resolution center. I don&#039;t know from personal experience, but that doesn&#039;t sound like an ideal resolution, and I think the admins are there to make sure both parties resolve the issue in a responsible manner

				If the package never arrived you can&#039;t be sure of anything.&nbsp; I personally wouldn&#039;t order from a vendor again that I had had a no show from, no matter how good their feedback was.
