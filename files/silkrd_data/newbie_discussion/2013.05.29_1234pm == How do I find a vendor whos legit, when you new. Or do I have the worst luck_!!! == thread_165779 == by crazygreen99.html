				Hi all,<br />I am new to silk road, but not to the game. I have had the same vendor for 4 years. Before the JWH got banned. I am complete out. I was running a small novelty shop. But now just deal with friends. <br /><br />Now today, for the third time. I will either get burned, (although he said max thursday) or be back up and running. The need is here, and I need RC cannaboids, EAM or AM or JWH, anything.&nbsp; Im waiting for the samples of about 6 different cannboids, and the plan was to check them out and send dude $500 more. I paid for these samples with shipping. also if I wasnt in such a damn hurry I would have found out Alchemy Research Company (fuckin total scam artist) was indeed going to keep my $350 for pre packaged synth smoke. <br /><br />Im not feeling optimistic about the mail today. But who knows.&nbsp; CANNABOID /&nbsp; DMT sellers!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />If you sell DMT, cannaboids, prepacked canna synth incense. And are willing to meet me have way, or something. I AM A RELIABLE BUYER, regardless that I just joined. I have a market here, that iv kept for awhile. And now about to lose my car.<br /><br />I need somebody really solid, and pull through with a empty wrapper for a sample. Just please anyone who is serious in getting a good customer, please let me show you. My partner and I have been looking really hard. But how do you tell the scam from the legit, I have yet to receive anything to help out this already shitty drought here. Not one thing since I started this hunt. But this is SR, and I have heard this is the place to be. So any positive feedback on how to get on track as fast as possible. I do have money.
