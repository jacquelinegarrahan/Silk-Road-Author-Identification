				Just wonder for those who have had them before? <br />Also would they be addressed to the house owner or the person the package was being delivered to?

				I guess it depends on the country as well as what the product is and the quantity.<br /><br />In Australia, you&#039;d expect a customs letter within a week or 2. Here in Aus, the letter is addressed to the person who it was delivered to. Don&#039;t know about other countries though.

				I&#039;ve heard seizure letters often come shortly after the the package is scheduled to arrive. So let&#039;s say the vendor said your product would be there in 4 days, it would take customs an extra day or two to check the contents of your package and get the letter sent to you. And the letter will be addressed to the person who ordered it.

When a vendor states 2-7 days does this mean only delivery days or just standard 7 days as i do not want to complain when there is technically some delivery days left on the order.&nbsp;

				Also if the time does elapse on delivery, given the product which would you advise after speaking to the vendor, instant redelivery, ask for a little time to see if letter comes through as it could be lost or a seizure letter comes through or cut loses and take offered refund?

				Either find a new address for re-delivery or take refund and run to a local dealer is my opinion. Part of the reason i pay an insane amount of money for my benzos is not taking the chance of getting busted by informants, undercovers, or being pulled over and searched. Once you get a customs letter, i&#039;d consider address as being in the least indefinitely compromised.

You can&#039;t stop people sending you items (legal or illegal) so don&#039;t worry.

				The only one I ever got, the vendor and I figured took an extra 2 days. That was from Amsterdam. It&#039;s amazing that anything get&#039;s out of that city, with that postmark. <br /><br />The very same day it arrived, another one from the same post ofc came! - Talk about a lump in the back of your throat!!! :o<br /><br />The vendor was amazed, and I guess this is when the &#039;better stealth&#039; light-bulb went on over his head.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />We chatted back+forth about commonly shipped items. I used my many ebay examples. He wanted to see a scan of the letter, which I did. He said he believed me, he just had never gotten one, and wanted to frame it proudly! ???&nbsp; :) Crazy guy. - Turned out to be a lot of fun to correspond with. <br /><br />Also I&#039;m happy to report, his 100% improved stealth made it to me the following week. Not only that, but it had been opened, and stapled hastily back together. (Bubble wrap parcel envelope). We figured it was on the NL side, because they&#039;d do it that way according to him. Also the fact that they opened it, but failed to find it was laughable. I don&#039;t want to give any more away, but let&#039;s just say it just about hiding in plain site!<br /><br />I checked back on his listings as the months went by, and noticed a big improvement in sales, and his rating. With lots of comments on the excellent stealth!&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think I can take a little credit for that one! ::)<br /><br />The particular product I wanted he didn&#039;t have all the time, and as months passed, I found my regular Vendors, with less notable cities as the post office.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I wish I could give him a shout out, but I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll read this, and remember.&nbsp; It&#039;s been about a year. So much has changed. I went right along ordering, figuring, if they&#039;ve got me, they&#039;ve got me. Though if you saw the letter, it&#039;s really quite dissapointing, I mean if you were hoping to show someone and say LOOK!&nbsp; For shock value or whatever. <br /><br />A very poor photo copy of a form letter. Had to at one time have been copied using an old fax machine. If you know what I mean. <br />Add another 3 generations of&nbsp; re-copying it, along with poor alignment, and it might as well have been an &quot;out of order&quot; sign in a laundromat!<br /><br />Thanks for indulging me that trip down memory lane. Definitely a growth spurt there.&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Chip
