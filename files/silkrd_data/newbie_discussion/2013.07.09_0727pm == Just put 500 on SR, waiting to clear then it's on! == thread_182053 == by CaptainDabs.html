				CaptainDabs here, longtime buyer here on SR and I&#039;m in the process of creating a vendor account right now! Just waiting for the $$ to clear, to start I&#039;ll be offering top shelf marijuana and quite possibly locally sourced field mushrooms for very cheap about 65$ for an oz if there is a market for them. When you order from me I can guarantee the best shipping methods, vacuum sealed, multiple layers and printed labels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look for me within the next couple days, I will be offering samples for reviews to get this thing going. <br /><br /><br />

				Just regular field cubes from the Sunshine State. They are of great quality for the price.<br /><br />A slight delay over 6$ USD is holding up my vendor account but I should have everything figured out here shortly.

Due to the abundance we ONLY pick the BEST of the BEST!! No contaminants of any sort, and they are dried to perfection. I have had plenty of people tell me that they would have believed me had I said I grew them in my closet at home. They are definitely worth the price, and I know once the reviews start rolling in people will fall in love with these versus 200$ an oz for almost the same thing.<br /><br />Thanks!
