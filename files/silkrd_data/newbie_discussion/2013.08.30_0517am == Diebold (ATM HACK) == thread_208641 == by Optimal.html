				Hi,<br /><br />I purchased a guide to hack some ATM. One of them is Diebold. There are a lot of Diebold ATM in my country (CA) and I want to know if someone had successfully hacked one of them. Well, we can share our experiences/expertise together and try to make it profitable!<br /><br />Thank you for your help and I shall help you too!

				Sorry, no experience personally, though I am just as interested as you are. Did you order from namedeclined?<br /><br />My main concern is how quickly the hack can be executed.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to do this if I&#039;m gonna have to stand at any ATM for a prolonged period of time, fiddling with some technology I know shit all about, all the while likely being watched by CCTV.

				You could also make a homemade shape charge out of copper and TATP. Careful with the TATP though, temperamental little bitch she is.... :)

Other who are joking are ok too ;) Yeah, &quot;the hacks&quot; or more like &quot;technicians maintenance privates things&quot; seem really fast. I will try other ATM company such as Triton or Tranax, but for Diebold, it seem a bit more complicated (the instruction are not clear) and it&#039;s why I search for someone who had success with it!
