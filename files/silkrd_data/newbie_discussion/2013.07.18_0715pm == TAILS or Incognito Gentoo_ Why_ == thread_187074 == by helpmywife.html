				TAILS by a mile.&nbsp; &quot;Incognito&quot; browsing leaves plenty of traces behind on whatever machine is being used, and TOR itself can still have transmissions intercepted at exit nodes.&nbsp; You are also vulnerable to other various methods of attack such as&nbsp; keyloggers, rootkits and the like.<br /><br />Tails leaves no record whatsoever on your machine,&nbsp; and only stores data in an optional &quot;persistent&quot; portion of the drive designed to keep programs or documents you might need accessible while using it.&nbsp; This is useful for (encrypted) text files containing passwords and links, BTC wallet information, etc. <br /><br />Even with tails, it makes good sense to make use of additional security layers such as vpns and proxies.&nbsp; The entire USB drive you run TAILS from should also be encrypted with a program like Truecrypt in case of physical seizure or scrutiny.&nbsp; &nbsp; Although it should go without saying, you also have to be sure to keep seperate your personal web-browsing from your torrified quasi-anonymous sensitive browsing.&nbsp; No checking e-mail or social networks, no looking at anything that could give geographical clues as to your location (news, weather, googling businesses or addresses, USPS tracking, etc).&nbsp; In fact, any kind of clearnet browsing through TOR carries the risk of undermining or negating your anonymity.&nbsp; Running day-to-day plugins like flash and javascript or downloading files is also very unsafe, in case you weren&#039;t aware.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t mean to come off as a dick by saying so, but if you had to ask this question you should probably do a bit more research on the subject.&nbsp; Even with TOR and using a secure live OS with no data retention, TOR has vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can easily be overcome if you take the time to understand what they are, why they exist, and how they can be liabilities to your dealings on the darknets.&nbsp; The (largely un-finished) guide in my signature might contain a few pointers for you, especially since it looks like you&#039;re already ok with using linux.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have a veritable library of bookmarked articles and tutorials from various sites and forums on just about every aspect of security, anonymity, and cryptography, so if there&#039;s anything in particular you want to learn the innerworkings of, I&#039;d be happy to help wherever I can.&nbsp; It may seem a bit overwhelming at first but it&#039;s actually not too much to digest if you have good resources (like these forums).&nbsp; Just remember you&#039;re at the beginning of a journey, and the end result of your dealings on this site and others like it can either be very positive or very, very negative.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the time to learn how to walk safely.<br /><br />Welcome to the Road!<br /><br /><br />Some reading (all clearnet!)<br /><br />http://anoninsiders.net/simple-vpn-guide-623/index.html<br /><br />http://geekyschmidt.com/2011/02/22/tor-vpn-a-simple-explanation<br /><br />http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9223410/how-do-i-use-tor-as-system-vpn-and-cut-out-some-nodes<br /><br />http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/archive/index.php/t-18744.html<br /><br />https://whyweprotest.net/community/threads/using-tor-in-order-to-surf-anonymously.69264/<br /><br />

And the thought of split-booting an OS with established boots/programs on it makes me want to pee blood.<br /><br />Putting up layers of security is, surely, only really necessary if you&#039;re doing dealing and dealing large.<br /><br />We already know PGP has been broken by the NSA. My thought is they have automated systems looking for encryption they have yet to successfully hack and that alone would pique their interest.

				i use tails now, i used to use the tor browser bundle on windows.<br /><br />when you get raided they have a little thing that plugs into all your comps and sees if tor has ever been installed on your computer, even if you uninstalled. then they take the ones that have tor on them for further inspection. i dunno about you but i dont want cops looking through everything.<br /><br />tails you just use it when you need it and take it out so you dont have that problem.
