				I&#039;m no expert and not gonna comment on the morals of keeping or returning, but if the SIM is left in and phone turned on I believe you are knackered before you start.

				I was thinking about selling them on ebay but only if the buyer is gonna get a good, valid, working phone.&nbsp; Then again, I don&#039;t want tmobile to be able to track them back to me when the buyer goes to activate them.&nbsp; As far as they&#039;re concerned, I never received them.&nbsp; So far, they haven&#039;t asked about them.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				it is very possible that they have all of the IMEI numbers registered. in that case they would discover a few phones are missing on the next inventory check. in that case delivery notes of postal workers might be checked and an error might be discovered.<br /><br />I would also wait until the next bill comes. just to see if everything is alright. :)

				Hi Change, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I already got my first bill and it&#039;s for 3 lines.&nbsp; Just what I ordered.&nbsp; I never signed for the shipment so they have no proof I received both boxes.
