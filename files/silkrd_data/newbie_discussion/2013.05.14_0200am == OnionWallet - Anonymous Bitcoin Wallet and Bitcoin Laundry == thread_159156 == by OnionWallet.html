Whilst you may lose your Bitcoin anytime you send them to someone else, BitcoinFog and blockchain.info have longer histories and are regarded as reputable. Perhaps if OnionWallet is still around in a year, consider giving them a try.<br /><br />Libertas

				I&#039;m as skeptical as everyone else... though you can&#039;t have a history if one doesn&#039;t get made. Everything starts somewhere.<br /><br />However, randomly posting to the newbies section on SR is suspicious in and of itself. If its truly a service to be vetted, I think rep around here would be a first priority - then advertise your service.

				Also, anyone in the BTC world knows that these sorts of services are suspect.&nbsp; A legitimate service would have provided more information and an actual introduction, in my opinion.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t go near it.

Of course, that happened because its the first post this account ever made. And, they didn&#039;t come back...<br /><br />And it suspiciously popped up last night as a number of threads in the newbie section were specifically talking about this very topic, and the persistence of scams.

				You can test, but first with a lower amount like 10 USD. By making my first steps<br />i ve read through the internet about some wallets and everybody tell only good<br />things about Bitoinfog. I ve read not some about the TORwallet. It need to be<br />tested so you can be the first candidate and tell us your experience with it ;D

				Sorry Meerkovo.&nbsp; Darknet link to Bitcoin Fog is fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion . I&#039;ve never used them, so I can&#039;t vouch for them, but they seem fairly well regarded on SR.

				ok so I guess I was the guinea pig for this service and guess what? yeah you guessed it,&nbsp; they jacked all my coins.&nbsp; :-[ I was looking forward to spending some money here on SR for the first time, did all my research.. not enough obviously, learned encryption, got liberte on my USB drive... found a btc service that accepted deposits at the bank via cash. I ordered the BTC friday and was delivered the 150 dollars worth of btc to my onionwallet sometime today, only to find out it was cashed out to another address a few hours later. I dont know why I transferred that much the first time using this service I feel like an idiot.. When I try logging into my account on the site I just get a blank page. Needless to say im pissed. DO NOT USE ONIONWALLET<br />&nbsp;

Reading and learning is good, but I strongly suggest you ask questions before you do it the first time. Get a reality check. It is very easy for someone to see what they want to be true, and then do it based upon that easy belief. The one thing you can be sure of here, is if you&#039;ve justified a stupid decision in your mind, we will tell you about it :)<br /><br />My suggestion is to keep it simple, especially if you aren&#039;t as familiar/skilled with this sort of technology. Get your own wallet locally - the bitcoin wiki on clearnet has many suggestions on how to do this. Always send your bitcoins there. Hosted wallets all suffer from the same potential issue: you are trusting someone else with your money for one, and for two you never know when/if they&#039;re going to be shut down. If they get taken offline, your money is as good as gone. Use the bitcoinfog link found earlier in this thread to transfer from your personal wallet to SR. Making a wallet locally, is easy, and there is no limit to how many you can make. You can make a new one for each transaction, each and every time, and you can burn it afterwards.
