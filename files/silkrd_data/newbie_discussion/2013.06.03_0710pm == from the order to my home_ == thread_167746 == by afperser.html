				That didn&#039;t make for easy reading, but when you place an order, update your order with your name and address, most use pgp encryption, some use privnote.com. <br /><br />When the vendor accepts your order and marks it &quot;in transit&quot; you have the option to finalize or resolve an issue. <br /><br />The general rule is do not finalize early. That is the whole point of escrow. <br /><br />Hope that helps

				When you see that the package is &quot;in transit&quot;, that generally means that it has been shipped, and is on its way to you.<br /><br />In regards to paying the vendor, in my experience it&#039;s best to wait until you receive the package and confirm that you got what you paid for (quality and quantity).
