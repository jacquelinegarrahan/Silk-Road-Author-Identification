				Ok, so I&#039;ve done:<br /><br />Coke<br />Weed<br />Shrooms<br />Opiates<br /><br />and I must admit coke is amazing.&nbsp; For someone with depression-low-self esteem-social anxiety, it&#039;s just grand...for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Opiates are fun to until I start nodding even after the high has dissipated.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is the feeling that is so great with meth that you are willing to risk your saftey?<br />This isn&#039;t a PSA. I&#039;m genuinely curious

				Alright, I think I am the only actual meth advocate posting here yet, so let me break down why meth is my DoC currently with some background:<br /><br />--Have been a heavy cocaine (powder, nasal) user<br />--Have been a heavy heroin (powder, IV) user at another point<br />--Love MDMA to this day<br /><br />Meth combines the positive aspects of all of these drugs without the negative.&nbsp; It gives me the verbal eloquence that cocaine does without the tweak/fiending, the pleasant clarity of heroin without the physically addictive properties, and the extroversion of MDMA without feeling inebriated.<br /><br />For reference, I use meth mostly orally as my RoA; I have never smoked or IV&#039;ed it.&nbsp; I usually do a bump nasally when I first get it to get going, but I really prefer taking it orally.&nbsp; It lasts longer, doesn&#039;t have the sharp &#039;edge&#039;, and I personally get a better euphoria/sense of well-being with it.<br /><br />Another positive of meth for me is that I can ONLY get it on the road where I live; it simply isn&#039;t available elsewhere, despite almost every other drug being around.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;m sure&nbsp; I could synthesize some bathtub meth, but I&#039;m not interested in that.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This is only my personal experience; I know that for many others that meth is more addictive than any of the other drugs I have used, but for me it seems to be a happy and affordable mid-ground.&nbsp; Also, even buying it on SR, I feel it is VERY economical for the amount I use vs. what I pay, significantly more so than anything other than maybe imported MDMA, which you can&#039;t use for more than two doses in a row without feeling tapped out due to tolerance and the like.

(Rave Scene circa 1995ish) <br /><br />i absolutely adored it. drug of choice. until i found myself wanting it on thursdays then wednesdays instead of on the weekends only. gave it up (never smoked it though, i guess its harder to give up that way) easily. although MDMA 160mg and 75mg crystal is still fun to do every once in a while. <br /><br />
