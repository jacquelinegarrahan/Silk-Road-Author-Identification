				Also, you should be able to unlink feedback and history from your account. If you have finalized something and you leave a feedback, the feedback is just lying there forever. If you&#039;re being monitored somehow or the police access your SR account, they have proof that you have bought those products. I see no reason why feedback should be visible to the author forever. I find the account history feature useless.

				First off use PGP, always (there&#039;s several forum topics about how to set it up).<br /><br />I wish account history on SR wasn&#039;t permanent. Maybe hang around for 30 days and then it&#039;s purged.&nbsp; Any PMs I sent at SR I always used the sellers PGP key aside from a couple times where I just replied &quot;acknowledged&quot; in plain text as that doesn&#039;t reveal anything.

				For some reason I was under the impression that messages are deleted automatically after a few days, so I never used PGP. I will from now on, though. However, it&#039;s not exactly hard to take a look at the vendor&#039;s profile and decrypt all the messages, so is PGP even useful? Maybe if the PGP key is changed regularly...<br /><br />I also think the admins should send out a warning about the deletion of all messages soon. SR has some security holes that could easily be fixed but never are.<br /><br />

				Both purchase history (not stats) and PMs are deleted automatically after a few months.

I believe your account history stops showing transactions after 30 days which is how long they allow you to change your feedback. I agree this is too long and feedback should be locked in after one week. Two weeks tops.

				So really, all that needs to be done is change the expiration date on feedback from a month to a week or two. However, since some listings are shipped very slowly (more than autofinalization + a week), maybe keep the 30 days, but add a button to remove the feedback. Just a little &quot;X&quot; that you can click as soon as you&#039;re finished giving feedback.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195968.msg1413033#msg1413033">Quote from: dotgoat on August 05, 2013, 03:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195968.msg1412685#msg1412685">Quote from: Audiopolis on August 05, 2013, 01:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">However, it&#039;s not exactly hard to take a look at the vendor&#039;s profile and decrypt all the messages, so is PGP even useful?
