				My shipper was raided by DEA recently. They didn&#039;t find anything in his possession but they did have video of him shipping and surveillance pictures. They&#039;ve been following him for a&nbsp; few weeks. email account at safe-mail has been taken offline. He didn&#039;t say a word but I&#039;m assuming they found a link between the website and my email. Not sure if they were monitoring it or not. I really hope not. I&#039;m terrified that they were because that means they have a good amount of info.<br />So fml <br />

				Two fear monger psy-op threads in one day?!&nbsp; &nbsp;Sheesh... somebody&#039;s winning that extra box of doughnuts this week, eh?<br /><br />If your &quot;shipper&#039;s&quot; email is offline... how are you talking to him?&nbsp; Did he write you a irl letter?<br /><br />Why are you posting from a brand new account?... if they already know who you are or not, not like it&#039;d matter if you posted from your supposed real account.<br /><br />I&#039;m quaking in my boots!&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t buy this....

				Buy what you like, could care less.<br />My shippers email and my email are both off line. My phone works just fine. He got a new one and called me. It&#039;s not magic dude.<br />They don&#039;t know who I am. they know who he is and they know my email address, website, possibly my pick up addresses. Leave&#039;s me in a bind.<br />I didn&#039;t post under my real account because the email is similar to that of my account name on here.<br />Not an SR vendor obviously.<br />Originally I was going to ask advice but I can&#039;t think of any advice for myself and I&#039;m pretty good at this. So I&#039;m just playing it day by day and taking it slow.

				Why in the world would your supplier call you? How would he have gotten a new phone, and called you, considering he had just been busted? He would be in jail. <br />Even if he made bail, he would not call you. He&#039;s not going to put his ass on the line to warn you. <br /><br />You&#039;re full of shit.

				If that really happened to a shipper then that sucks.<br /><br />One thing for sure is the US GOV has been doing all they can to find a way to end the SR.&nbsp; I hear a task force has been assigned to the job.<br />If I was on that task force and could not find any way to stop the sales I would make accounts and spread lies about busts and get the users to stop using it.<br />MISINFORMATION is a powerful weapon over time.&nbsp;

				They would watch you for a while before moving in so if you want to be really careful stop for 2 mo. or more.&nbsp; Plus once your a suspect they sends the rats in after you, so you would get calls from people you haven&#039;t heard from in a while.

SR members, Hands up if you&#039;ve ever been in a non-text conversation with your vendor! ..we saw something along the lines of this example in the story about tony, and i think most people are aware that any communication outside the boarders of SR is a huge security risk, so if this really happened, you more or less got what you asked for ;)<br /><br />...and seriously having your email address seized by DEA sounds like quite an impressing task.. If anything, I would imagine they would gain access to your account and read your mail, but I see no motivation what so ever to make it as obvious as to seize the entire thing.<br /><br />But then again, what do I know? I don&#039;t even watch those ridiculous detective shows on the telly, so I have no idea what they&#039;re capable of or how they do it. But it sounds silly nonetheless

				I kind of doubt this happened.&nbsp; But if it did, the exposure to his customers or even to SR is probably negligible.&nbsp; All good things must come to an end, but DEA has no idea how to stop SR.&nbsp; Cops bust dealers by buying from them in person.&nbsp; I really doubt this happened.

				At least tell the story well in the future. <br /><br />Not likely psyop&#039;s. I think they would have come up with a more believable story.<br /><br />More likely a self appointed zelot, member of a parental group, his a guy thats bored. <br /><br />Sorry dude I know you just trying to entertain us but nothing about the story is believable.

				This is my first time in the newbie thread an this gave me a good laugh..At first i thought sure coulda happen<br />but how and why of all customer would he contact u?<br /><br />Then i read on and see where the OP,lol im still LOL at this says &#039;He called me&#039; WTF? REALLY OP?<br /><br />Your vendor called u huh? Well if this is true no wonder why he got raided and both u will end up busted. he whole point of coming here and using TOR is to make up BS and throw people off about where your from,who u r, etc.. Its not to exchange phone calls and txts thats stupid and that is a direct connection between u and the vendor, fully un doing what tor and encryption and bitocin does. which is break the link between all..<br /><br />Please give us this vendors name so us older members which would not fall victim to this no way no how,cause were not kids and have sense and did what allot of u dont do! READ THE INFO ON HEREM ITS HERE FOR A REASON! and very helpful use it..<br /><br />Again please give us the vendors name,so we can avoid using him , OBTW TELL HIM TO LET ME HAV HIS ACCOUNT!! I&#039;LL TAKE IT OVER, NO NEED in leter it go to waste, i&#039;ll give him a few coin...<br /><br />How many of u believe this after u read &#039;vendor called me!&quot; lmao..<br /><br />

				No one believes it. At first I just thought the guy got scammed till I read the part where his e-mail was allegedly seized and the vendor called him. <br /><br />Completely gave it away.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />
