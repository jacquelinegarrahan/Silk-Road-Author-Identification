				PLEASE DO NOT SPAM THIS THREAD&nbsp; - MANY THANKS<br /><br />Ok, I am an established SR buyer who is also active on the forums under another name. This thread is for BG customers to discuss the recent crap and how it affects us, and what action we are taking regarding our drops, account usernames, and so on. Others are welcome to join in if they have informed opinions to give but this thread is not for random speculative bollocks, thank you. Also, no abuse of BG, what&#039;s done is done. BG - please feel free to contribute.<br /><br />We are working on the assumption that BG has told the total truth. The only information on the compromised list is SR user names and drop name/address. There is no concrete link to SR on the list and no mention of product or amount. There is no link to the BG account. Therefore IF list is recovered from the vast tormail files it is just a list of usernames and names/addresses that somebody wanted to keep secret that could have been receiving anything from anywhere. IS THIS CORRECT BG?<br /><br />My situation. Unfortunately my forum name and SR name are the same, let&#039;s call me Mr A. My drop is an address over 10 miles from where I live and goods are delivered there under a fake name. it is a long established drop. My thinking is to burn the drop address and my forum account totally. I am however loathe to kill my SR account. My stats and rep are good and it would take me along time to rebuild that. What I would REALLY like would be for SR to let me keep my stats under a new username but it&#039;s seemingly impossible. MOST UNFORTUNATE.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Am wondering what others think. Why would it be dangerous to keep the SR Username? LE might know that Mr A may have ordered something unknown to an address in townA, granted. how can that compromise Mr A&#039;s order to townB? Would not LE have to fish for Mr A&#039;s new drop in exactly the same way as they would maybe fish for any buyers drop address? What would be the point therefore in killing the account?<br /><br />BG clients and experienced informed views only please, thank you<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I created this account as a result of the blunder that BG made. Also made a new account on the main site to match. I will only access the old account to finalize when the order that&#039;s in transit shows up, and trust me, I wish I didn&#039;t have a parcel on the way. I won&#039;t be accessing that account again after that.<br /><br />I&#039;m frustrated to lose my good stats that I had built up over several months. I never let a transaction auto-finalize, and what refunds I had were the result of banned scammer vendors. The stats spoke for themselves, and it&#039;s irritating to have to start over from scratch.<br /><br />Even more irritating is having to spam the forums to get back to full member status. TOR is slow at the best of times, and it was a total waste of my time to have to cruise thru the newbie forums to get to 50 posts, and as you can see, I&#039;m still not back to 100 (I think this about my 80th post).<br /><br />I do believe that the likelihood of anything coming of the compromised info is low, but it sure has made me carefully analyze my situation and reconsider whether I&#039;m keeping safe. Like many here, I have a lot to lose if I were to get busted somehow. I do believe that SR is still a far better option than RL dealers. <br /><br />If a street dealer got popped and all his calls and texts were examined by LE, there would be no possibility of a warning like BG provided after his screw-up, which is an important fact that helps me keep things in perspective.<br /><br />None of this is to excuse the colossal nature of the security breach, and I sure wouldn&#039;t make a purchase from BG again, if and when he resumes sales.

Correct?<br /><br />If so that is even worse than I thought as there&#039;s been no mention of amounts so far. Would have been better in a way if the actual products were listed as 100g GHB can easily be a personal amount as opposed to, say Heroin. Seems to make it even more likely that people may get raided if they think everyone on the list was a dealer.<br /><br />The thing i am not getting is if somebody could use a different drop miles away what exactly is the point in ditching the old SR account? anyone?

				Something i haven&#039;t thought of is that we can be investigated for child pornography. I don&#039;t think the police would bother going through big troubles just to catch people receiving some small amounts of drugs, but with child pornography it&#039;s more likely.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if I&#039;m just being paranoid here, please give me some input on this. Being accused for buying drugs isn&#039;t nearly as bad as being accused of spreading C.P. (Seeing a list of user names of a shady site with bad encryption while looking for C.P, and then looking into it, it&#039;s not too far fetched?)

IS THIS CORRECT BG?<br /><br />My situation. Unfortunately my forum name and SR name are the same, let&#039;s call me Mr A. My drop is an address over 10 miles from where I live and goods are delivered there under a fake name. it is a long established drop. My thinking is to burn the drop address and my forum account totally. I am however loathe to kill my SR account. My stats and rep are good and it would take me along time to rebuild that. What I would REALLY like would be for SR to let me keep my stats under a new username but it&#039;s seemingly impossible. MOST UNFORTUNATE.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Am wondering what others think. Why would it be dangerous to keep the SR Username? LE might know that Mr A may have ordered something unknown to an address in townA, granted. how can that compromise Mr A&#039;s order to townB? Would not LE have to fish for Mr A&#039;s new drop in exactly the same way as they would maybe fish for any buyers drop address? What would be the point therefore in killing the account?<br /><br />BG clients and experienced informed views only please, thank you<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mostly correct.<br /><br />It can be determined that usernames are from SR. Amounts are listed but no mention of product. Nor is there a connection to BlueGiraffe.<br /><br />Otherwise as you&#039;ve described it.<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />there is a connection to you since it&#039;s under your email<br /><br />however as i speculated elsewhere, it will be extremely hard to get a conviction without the drug itself. i may have just missed it but i dont think you mentioned amounts were leaked?! i dont think anyones ever been convicted (it may be enough for a search warrant but thats a separate issue) on say, 100g of something<br />on top of that your big business (GHB) is minor in most countries. uk class c, us schedule iv etc. i believe the most illegal thing you had was mescaline but that was new<br /><br />im guessing the worst that will happen is that addresses may be monitored. so be smarter with your drops<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />there is no connection to BG via his tormail as it would have been an anonymous email addres<br /><br />the amounts are stated in the compromised email but not the substance, which makes it worse in some ways as people buy a lot of grams of ghb for personal use, so it will look like many people linked with buying a lot of grams of an unknown substance<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />his tormail address is bluegiraffe@tormail.org - if that info was available on the servers its a pretty dead giveaway<br /><br />when it comes down to charges, they cant because theres no evidence of substance. for all they know you conspired to possess 100g of salt<br />however if they do raids based on the new evidence which is very unlikely, they MAY target those who had high volume. but any charges made can only be founded on what they find in their raids<br /><br />in theory it looks bad since it could be 100g of G, 100g of LSD, who knows. but thats just it, they dont know. they might be able to get a search warrant based on the leaks but charges?

				This has been asked further up in this thread but not really answered:<br /><br />If a customer was to keep their compromised SR account, but ship to a new name /&nbsp; address... is there any harm that can come of it??<br /><br />I mean obviously LE can have your SR user name, but if packages are being sent to another name and addy then how is it traceable?<br /><br />
