				Recently, news/media haven&#039;t been able to keep their mouth shut about SR or it&#039;s related marketplaces, which doesn&#039;t surprise me too much, but lets get to the real issue here.<br /><br />Many people decide that they should brag about how they just bought a couple mollies or a few hits of acid from the road, so they blindly post a picture and tag accordingly, just search the silkroad tag on tumblr and you&#039;ll see what I mean. <br /><br />These shitty writers are starting to learn how to use the internet, and are including these tagged photos in their posts, many of which show methods of stealth some vendors use, blotter art, etc. <br /><br />This is very, very bad. SR is a beautiful thing, but it is mostly populated by people who can think for themselves, people who aren&#039;t dumb enough to believe that every package and letter ever sent through anything is throughly searched. In my opinion, this is a huge reason for its&#039; success. It&#039;s a community of mostly intelligent people who know how to protect their own and their vendor&#039;s privacy.<br /><br />When you show methods of shipping, you&#039;re completely exposing what the vendor worked hard to keep from getting exposed. When you show blotter art, it makes it very easy to pinpoint the vendor it came from (I recognized a couple on a NYT post if I recall correctly). <br /><br />Seriously, you&#039;re buying drugs, not food, keep your shit to yourself and off of your instagrams.<br /><br />On another note, a primary focus of the articles are how teens, you read that right, kids, are buying from the road. <br /><br />Now, there&#039;s really no way to know if your customer is an adult or not, so vendors can&#039;t really help fight this. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a kid, you likely live with your family in the same house. Ordering from SR puts everyone and everything inside said house at risk. Also remember that your parents or legal guardians are the ones who take the biggest fall if anything from LE comes into play. Please, don&#039;t be that guy. Just wait until you&#039;re an adult.<br /><br />Anyways, here&#039;s some very easy tips to keep yourself safe.<br /><br />1: Keep your mouth shut regarding anything to do with mail ordering drugs<br /><br />This is a must. If anyone asks where you got that o of dank ass buds, say your boy hooked you up, or, you know, don&#039;t answer.<br /><br />2: PGP<br /><br />This is also a must. Encrypt messages to vendors, your address, and anything else sensitive. You wouldn&#039;t see so many people telling you to use it if it wasn&#039;t that important. It&#039;s very easy to do, I promise.<br /><br />3: Never, ever order anything with a fake name<br /><br />It used to work, but LE is getting smarter. Only order using your real name. Using a name that has never received mail at the address prior, or that is currently receiving mail at a different address is almost always a guaranteed intercept, love letter, or for the really unlucky, a controlled delivery.<br /><br />4: Never disclose your vendor&#039;s methods of stealth to anyone! <br /><br />This one is also important. It&#039;s called stealth for a reason, keep it that way.<br /><br />5: Never finalize early (FE)<br /><br />Every so often, SR gets a round of scammers. They&#039;re actually very easy to detect. 99% of the time, they require FE, and usually they have lots of repeated feedback/FE&#039;s in their feedback. The escrow system is there for your protection, USE IT. <br /><br />6: Don&#039;t make it easy for someone to figure out who you are.<br /><br />A compromised identity is one of those things you just won&#039;t want. It puts you at risk. If anyone finds out your identity, trash it and make a new one. Simple as that. Don&#039;t continue using a compromised handle.<br /><br />7: Pictures<br /><br />Seriously, this isn&#039;t food you&#039;re buying here, don&#039;t show it off to your instagram / tumblr / etc followers, as well as the public eye. Pictures usually contain a geotag, with exact coordinates to where the picture was taken. That&#039;s not good.<br /><br />8: The Silk Road subreddit<br /><br />I still to this day question why this exists. It is on clearnet, and it is *reddit*. It&#039;s safe to say you should avoid it.<br /><br />9: Multiple packages<br /><br />It&#039;s a very bad idea to have multiple packages coming in the same period of time. Space things out.<br /><br />10: Using anything but tor to access SR<br /><br />Do not use services like onion.to to access SR, it defeats the whole purpose of tor and exposes everything to your ISP, which means LE can see it too.<br /><br />11: Tails<br /><br />Tails is a beautiful thing, and all you need to run it is a flash drive. It&#039;s an entire operating system based on privacy. It routes all connections via Tor, erases everything once you&#039;re done, and even has a Windows XP mode if you don&#039;t want people to think you&#039;re using it. Using Tails is an easy way to help keep you as hidden as possible.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve likely missed a few things here, but following these steps should only help to keep you safer. <br /><br />Happy tripping / rolling / blazing / etc! :)

				Nice tips.<br />Can&#039;t agree about the Reddit though. As long as you access it through Tor, there&#039;s no problem. Especially when posting there. Needless to say it&#039;s a good idea to have a separate reddit account for that purpose.

				there should be some kind of popup stating these facts when you logon, also if a vendor sees his goods exposed there should be a way to block the buyer if he can be identified.<br />you shouldnt keep the address but try to remember the user?

				Spend copious amount time setting up layers of security to protect your identity and then blab about your illicit activity over the web.

				the FE thing is problematic to me.&nbsp; Some vendors have a huge network of reviews and feedback yet require FE for a new buyer which I understand, yet there&#039;s plenty of &quot;never FE&quot; advice floating around.&nbsp; Tough to know what to do.

				I had to FE for my second order (which was small enough and with enough research that I felt ok), but have never had to since. <br /><br />Won&#039;t ever again unless it&#039;s for a good reason (samples, long term relationship with vendor, etc.)<br /><br />Best to be patient, reach out to reputable vendors and you can build up your rep in time.

As long as you access it through Tor, there&#039;s no problem. Especially when posting there. Needless to say it&#039;s a good idea to have a separate reddit account for that purpose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dissagree because we should also be protecting SR from the clearnet as much as possible. If you think about it no one will be able to attack SR if they think it either doesnt exist or taken down. As much as I love Reddit we should be trying to keep SR off there entirely.

Use anything but tor to access SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I downloaded the torbrowser bundle and thought that using torbrowser was the only way TO access SR safely.?!?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe the OP is mentioning proxies that use tor and lists an example, but I could be wrong.... Either way, using an up-to-date version of the tor bundle with scripts disabled is what you should be doing.
