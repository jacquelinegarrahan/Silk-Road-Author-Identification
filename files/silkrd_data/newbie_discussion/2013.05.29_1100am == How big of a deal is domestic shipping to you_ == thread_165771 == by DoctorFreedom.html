				How important for you is the shipping to be domestic?<br />For example you can get a price twice better but have to order from another country would you go for it?

				Depends on the circumstances. The vendor must have a brilliant stealth method for me to even consider it. Even then, I only would consider non-domestic if the product is exceptionally good (like SAW&#039;s stuff was).

				In my opinion Domestic Shipping has the following advantages over International Shipping:<br /><br />* Quicker Delivery<br />* More secure as there&#039;s no customs<br />* Less possible damage on the package from being handled in multiple installations<br />* Cheaper cost (although this could admittedly be negated by higher product cost)<br /><br />Now this is obviously in the context of illegal drugs. The day drugs get legalized (if that ever happens) the benefits of International would most likely in many cases outweigh Domestic as large corporations would take over the distribution similar to how the tobacco industry works.

				Domestic shipping is great, especially when you have a reliable vender who will post the same day express, and receive the following day.<br /><br />But international also has its benefits, you need to have a well organized vender with experience and follows procedures as said above, works well in getting bulk and quality at a unbelievable price, but being from Australia I really do need to make sure I pick my vender carefully to get it through customs.

				I think that the combination of no customs and (potentially) next day delivery is a big plus. I&#039;ve ordered RCs from outside of my home country before but not out and out illegals.

				i think i would stay domestic! Since i am here i only placed domestic orders and never had a problem, the risk that my package will be intercepted by customs is too high so for me its not worth buying abroad. <br /><br />Kind of related question: Can anyone confirm that sending packages within the EU (within Schengen zone) is the 100% same risk as ordering domestic? So for example if i would order something from spain to portugal, it would be the exact same risk when ordering only from portugal to portugal? (only from the aspect of costums/any other especially looking for drugs)

				I certainly prefer to buy from domestic sellers. I&#039;ve only made a few purchases on SR so far, but I feel a lot more comfortable with making domestic orders because: 1) sellers speak my language, 2) faster shipping, 3) no customs to deal with, 4) decent variety of vendors and products from my country.<br /><br />I have made a purchase from an overseas vendor and it showed up without issue. I&#039;d probably only buy from international vendors if I was buying something that will fit in a regular envelope that would get put in my mailbox. Any larger items get kept behind the counter at the post office and I just get a card in my mailbox, so I can only get my item when the post office is open (Mon-Fri)

				I prefer domestic for the reasons stated. Price alone would not necessarily sway me to order from out of country. I&#039;m all for reduced risk.<br /><br />Haha they day drugs get legalized there will be bags next to the candybars in Walmart, except it will say &#039;farm raised in China&#039;, like their frozen salmon.

				domestic is definitely the better option, but for some products/vendors foreign quality and deals just seem so much better. Read the feedback to see how the stealth is and if the vendor&#039;s made successful shipments to your country. I&#039;ve successfully received several orders from Europe, Canada and India (I&#039;m in US) and never had one seized. Good stealth goes a long way -- one from India was opened by customs but still made it to me no prob.

				I think people should make purchases of non-illicit items from the international locations in which they wish to receive drugs from. This will give you an ok idea of how long it all takes, and how much abuse or any issues that may come to your pack. Testing never hurt anyone.&nbsp; ;D

				I am in the UK and order alot (hash) from EU vendors (spain, germany, denmark, NL)&nbsp; also had about 10 transactions with charas bros and every one has arrived from abroad.&nbsp; I did use a safe address for the charas bros just in case as i think of all of them this had the biggest chance of getting found but never did. <br /><br />The hash from spain, vendors : spanish fly and Emerald is well worth the extra day or two wait and always arrives. <br /><br />

				Domestic IMO:<br />That being said, I think it also depends on the frequency of packages you&#039;re receiving. Getting multiple packages from different countries may raise suspicion..<br /><br />Who knows?

				less risk involved, receive it quicker, and no customs. Think about it like this pay a bit extra and almost guarantee a quick delivery or pay less wait longer and might not get a package. Having said all that a buddy of mine i lived with used to have 1000 packs of onax shipped from pakistan $.70 a pop! never got stopped by customs and packaging was pretty shitty. what are you willing to risk?

				Def. prefer domestic orders. Still in resolution for an international order right now that hasn&#039;t shown up. I def. trust the vendor, as they&#039;re a vet on SR, but I believe the package was lost or either intercepted along the way somehow.

				I think it all depends on what it is and how much.&nbsp; Bulk orders from overseas would be a bit too sketchy for me although I know some peeps that used to send 10k pills of X.

Greed always gets people because they start to think that they are smart and not just lucky.&quot; If you keep trying to steal change from the well eventually you will fall in.&quot;<br />GP
