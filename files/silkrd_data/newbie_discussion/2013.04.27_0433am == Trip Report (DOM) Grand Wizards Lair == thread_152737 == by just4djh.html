				Dose: 5 MG<br />Dropped 531: Metallic taste<br />621: Begins to kick in minor nausea+sweaty palms (Note: nausea is worse with cigarette)<br />641: Trip begins listening to kid cudi in woods and the leaves are dancing to the music. I lick finger to check wind direction, there is no wind. I look at the rusted wheel in the Wild West and I can see the cracks and rust in detail, it is bright orange. <br />715: I walk into my house and get something to eat, I stand by the table and begin to eat some fish. As I look up I feel the anger from the baby in a picture I look away and remember I&#039;m tripping, but I can&#039;t shake the feeling that all the pictures in the room are staring at me. I look away and hurry out of my house.<br />730: Chilling w/M walking to gas station, time has sped up at this point and the ground is green and I see green snowflakes on the ground, yes green mofo snowflakes.<br />???: Walking back through the shortcut in the woods to my house. As I enter the woods I feel as though I&#039;m walking through a portal,&nbsp; As I look down I see grass and little flowers that seem to need to be cut around my ankles, but I do not feel them. I reach down in a futile attempt to grab them and am having trouble discerning the real from the unreal. The simplest smallest newborn plants seem to be bright vibrant flowers.<br />847-917 Watching Adult Swim in my room or at least trying too, but the light from the T.V keeps spinning and it is making it very hard to concentrate<br />1200 I turn off my TV and try to go to sleep, but there is a crack in the left side of my ceiling or at least I think there is, almost like something is lifting it up from outside. I begin to stare at it when out of the corner of my eye I see something coming out of where my light is and I hear mechanical whirry noises like something is coming out of my ceiling.<br />0200 Still can&#039;t sleep so I go have a cigarette on the porch, as I walk back inside instead of trying to go back to sleep I stare at the kitchen tiles and the white circles on there begin to mold together and form the picture of a turret. I have to break the image back down into the basic circles so I can break the trance I was in.<br /><br />Body weight- 147 LBS <br />Age: 18<br />Note: M also took a tab, however he ate coconut pie thirty minutes before and did not feel anything until the next day when he explained that all he felt was minor nausea. (comedown?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also any advice involving DOM would be greatly appreciated, I could not find very much information through Erowid about the drug other then the duration, safe dosages and a couple of trip reports.

				I also dosed 5mg of GWL&#039;s DOM about a week ago and I loved it. Like you said, it was hard to find much information on DOM on the internet. I held the blotter under my tongue for 30 minutes then swallowed, which led to a good trip. I&#039;m curious though, how did you take it? Did you just eat it? I wasn&#039;t sure the correct way to dose, so I just treated it like LSD.
