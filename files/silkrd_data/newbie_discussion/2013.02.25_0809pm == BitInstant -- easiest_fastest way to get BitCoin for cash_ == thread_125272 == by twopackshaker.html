				I am trying to go TODAY to exchange some cash for BitCoin so I can maybe place my first order soon or whatever. On BitInstant&#039;s website it says that BitCoin-to-email and a few other options are down, though. I don&#039;t have a Mt Gox account or anything like that. Let alone do I know what those things even are. <br /><br />Can somebody please explain to me how I can just go take some cash and turn it into coin, please? the BitCoin aspect of things is undoubtedly the hardest aspect to the entire thing.

				According to their website BTC-&gt; email is supposed to be back up today.&nbsp; So, if you can wait another 24hours, that&#039;s probably your best bet.&nbsp; IME, they respond usually within 1 hour to emails so you could try support@bitinstant.com<br /><br />People talk about Blue Sky Traders, but I have never used them personally because there are no Bank of America&#039;s in my area

				With bitinstant ou have to have a Mt.Gox account or something to deposit the bitcoins into. There&#039;s some possibly sketchy shit happening with bitinstant right now, so you might want to avoid it anyway. I&#039;m trying out Bitfloor right now. Bitfloor uses Bank of America to accept cash deposits for bitcoins. There&#039;s also ziggap, which takes cash deposits at Chase bank, but unfortunately their Chase deposits are not working right now. They do take MoneyGram deposits too though. You also need a bitcoin wallet or instawallet, where you&#039;ll get an address to deposit your bitcoins. You can&#039;t get &#039;em without an address. You could deposit directly to a SR address, but that&#039;s not recommended, for security reasons. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t used instawallet, but with the bitcoin wallet (bitcoin.com), I had to wait like 3 days to be able to do any transactions, for reasons that I sort of understand, but I&#039;m not the best person to explain it.

				Yeah supposedly Bitinstant will have their system back to normal today. But why do business with them when they&#039;re having so many issues lately?<br /><br />twopackshaker you have better options.<br /><br />If you have a Bank of America in your area i advise you to use https://bitfloor.com/ sign up then go to Deposit. Enter a deposit amount to begin your deposit. Simply go to the bank, fill out a deposit slip and had that along with cash to the teller, say you need to make a payment. The BTC will show up in your Bitfloor account, then you can send them wherever.<br /><br />A great option is also to use Blue Sky Traders, open Tuesday-Friday&nbsp; http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />Another option is to purchase a minimum $100 MoneyPak, then give that MP number to Sugar Mama for a fee. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/dda38e9d99<br /><br /><br />Good Luck, Hope this helps.

I was wondering what my wait was too. Then I noticed that it had to sync all the blocks. So I let it sync up over night, and walla, magic. On the comment about bitinstant being shadey. or &quot;sketchy&quot;, It literally took 5 mins for it to get into my account on mtgox. The longest part of the process other than me letting the offline sync up was the 53 mins it took to get them from blockchain to sr. I hope this has helped you, or anyone that may be wondering the same. =)

				Just got a bitfloor account today. It seems to be easy if you have BOA access. I like it as you can use TOR &amp; you don&#039;t have to use any ID -just an email. In the short time I&#039;ve been around it seems Mt Gox is asking for ID. Way too much info for our purposes.

				Yeah, I had no clue about not giving them my id on mt gox. because the guide I read made no mention of it. I do not feel threatened by what they have in the way of ID from me. I made a ligit transaction and they made money. What I am doing with them is establishing rep with them. I made a small purchase. Did my business with them. And removed myself as far away from them after as possible. And if someone wants ID bad enough, no matter where you go to trade that cash in for your coins. Smile, you are already on 5 cameras. before you get into a door. I am the one guy who probably gets caught though. Ha. As I said before. If they wanna spend the millions to fuck with me over a couple grams of weed that I consume in the privacy of my own home. Then they better do it porperly. Because I know my rights. Get your NORML card. I know a lot of you do bigger business than I am. But as far as myself goes and the amount of business I do on here. Is no different then me going past the local police station and all the cameras on the traffic lights to the same place for 2 and a half years at least twice a week. They can have at it. <br /><br />I read that mtgox will shut yea off if they found that you have funded a tor account. Okay, I said it before. IT is easy to hide on the interent. throw some proxies around and walla, magic. I would just make a new one and have it sent to different shit. <br /><br />The guide I did first read also mentioned getting your shit sent to a different address and not using said shit where you reside. I am going to say just for my own self. Others have said it too. I get stuff from ebay at my home now and again, other members of my family as well. It would look odd for me to accept a package elsewhere. And I feel safest using in my home. It is a controlled environment. <br /><br />I know I went on a bit there. My point is, everyone seems to have a method they feel comfortable with, like an old pay of sneakers feel when you put them on. Kind of bite the bullet and give a method a test run<br /><br />This as been brought to you by the number &amp;<br /><br />
