				Has anyone tried buying BTC from localbitcoin using paypal cash? I see there are people who will accept PP, but I&#039;m curious how long the transaction takes...<br /><br />Does it just depend on when the person is online or is there some kind of hold time that goes on during all PP transfers through them?

				It should be super fast, if the seller is as responsive as most on localbitcoins. Every transaction i&#039;ve had has been superbly fast, like less than 10 mins. They have an escrow system just like SR, and the coins are released to you as soon as the seller gets the money. If the listing is up, the vendor should be awake. If you click on the offer, seller should list all such parameters on that page.

				watch out for PayPal , you can get scammed hard and fast even though it is in escrow , they will call and dispute the lost money and lock your account up , and from what I have read it costs a high percent to cash your money off paypal , if you dont need those funds and go paypal route then buy gold and lock it up in your house for retirement funds, right now gold is going for 1400 an OZ and rising , its an investment for your future retirement , jus an idea, you can deposit the money via PP and call them for a check, but PP is risky and costly to cash out..... goto Localbitcoins.com and top right of page says forums , click that link and read about the paypal scams among other scams thats going on there , protect yourself by reading the forums and learning

				Localbitcoins is fantastic, don&#039;t know why you&#039;d wanna use paypal, aside from issues everyone&#039;s pointed out, it&#039;s tied to you on a more personal level, ie more information tying that purchase to you. Localbitcoins you can use cash with many sellers.

				HH you can call them and request a check ,which they charge a % to do , or they sell BTC on ebay for a high price , look up Bitcoins on ebay, they even have the hard coins there which might be a collectors item one day

But to transfer that money to your bank account is free of charge. I have a standard account, and I&#039;m assuming anyone here does as well. It might be different for a mechant account.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure about your second question. if there is a dispute paypal &quot;CAN&quot; lock your account. It&#039;s happened to me in the past.
