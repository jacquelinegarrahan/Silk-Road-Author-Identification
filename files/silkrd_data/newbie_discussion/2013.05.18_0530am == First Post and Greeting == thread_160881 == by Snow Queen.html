				Greetings everyone, <br /><br />I&#039;m setting up an account to move my business to SR. I&#039;ll be around working on my first 50 posts and should have some product and samples up soon. <br /><br />I&#039;m new to vending on SR but have a long career in the business. I spent some time with a buyer account and sampled around. I am confident that my product is as good as anyone on SR and I know my packaging is better than a lot of what I bought. <br /><br />I&#039;ll put up a proper Vendor thread when everything is done. <br /><br />Until then, adieu.

				Thanks Chronos.<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually been a SR user for a little over a year now. I used a buyer account and eventually decided I liked it and want to go forward with vending. I worked out a few logistical things here in the real world and I&#039;m moving my business to SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;I planned to start a few months ago but decided to wait out the DDOS issues. (Props to DPR for handling that and to the community for waiting it out.)<br /><br />So here I am gearing up some gear and getting ready to roll. <br />

				That would be great!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m still a couple days out for my first product listings though. I dont want to jump the gun. I want everything ready to roll when before I list. I&#039;m getting my newb status out of the way today.<br /><br />The technical end of the PGP and TOR is a big learning jump for me. I&#039;m think i&#039;m pretty good with it but I&#039;ve been running some test sends and other safety checks before I say go. <br /><br />I also had to finish off my real world commitments before i took this on. Its one or the other but it seems like most the busted threads come from mixing them. <br /><br />i digress..&nbsp; &nbsp;thanks CalicoJak!
