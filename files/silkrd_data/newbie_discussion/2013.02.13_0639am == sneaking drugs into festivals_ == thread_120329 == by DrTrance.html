				I haven&#039;t been to an event where they search your car. Sounds a bit excessive. I usually have my stuff in my sneakers. Hasn&#039;t failed me yet.

				If it&#039;s a camping festival, just load your car to the brim with shit and I guarantee you they won&#039;t be pulling out all your shit to search it. They pretty much open the trunk, look for a giant tank of nitrous laying there, then send you on your way. <br /><br /><br />There&#039;s windbreaker type jackets that have an entire layer between the windbreaker material and cloth inside that is essentially a gigantic pocket if you can carefully cut/create a clandestine opening. You then put your drugs carefully somewhere inside the seams of the jacket, secure with plastic tape, and voila! they won&#039;t be cutting your jacket open and so long as you take time into doing this, you can easily sneak in 1000&#039;s of pills or tabs or w/e the fuck :D<br /><br />If it&#039;s just like 100 caps of mdma or something, then wear two pairs of underwear, and stick the bag of drugs in between the two pairs of underwear near your GOOCH <br /><br /><br /><br />Most important thing is to scope out security as best you can before you go in. If you have friends with you, have them go in before you and have them scope out which security guard isn&#039;t really doing shit for patdowns.

				All the festies I go to, they will feel the lining of your jacket and what not.<br /><br />I usually gooch all my pills. IN every pair of boxer briefs there&#039;s a pocket where that faux hole in the front is. Been raving for years and have never gotten caught.

				really take time to study your car. I have been to several festivals and gone through everything from unroll your sleeping bag to last year I had to take off my shoes (I guess I got flagged or something lol) but mine is always tucked away nice and safe in a part of my car that you would have to pry open. Look around the inside for a compartment or area you can hollow out or create a stash spot super easy just use your noggin

				Some of the festivals I went to they check shoes too so I started taping the bag inside my crotch area or have the gf put inside her bra. Worked for me every time. Some of my friends get really creative and carefully open up cigarette packs and stash some stuff in there and re-seal the packs. They usually let you bring in cigs if they&#039;re sealed. Good luck!

				i have a girl doing a patch job on some pairs of whitey tightys (this double layer idea sounds promising)... sowing in small pouches.... its 300 or so capsules that im worried about.. i plan to vac pack them in packs of 50 so it should be easy enough... blotter is easy enough to hide and has no scent.... thanks for suggestions everyone... =)&nbsp; just hoping they keep the puppy&#039;s at home.. due to the fact my friends smoke so much dope they are sure to be stinking...&nbsp; &nbsp;i don&#039;t see a private festival being too intrusive...&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ok. In my experience there are 3 levels of drug smuggling for festivals. <br /><br />Level 1 - Personal use<br />Level 2 - You, friends, some light selling<br />Level 3 - Enough to remove sobriety from the festival<br /><br />You can smuggle, similarly, in 3 levels.<br /><br />Level 1 - Underwear. Easy, just throw it in there and keep it warm. <br />Level 2 -&nbsp; In your stuff, not in the trunk. Just throw it in a big duffle bag of clothes. They don&#039;t have the time to look too deep. They mostly just want to grab the idiots who make it obvious. Avoid the glovebox and trunk*.<br />Level 3 - The trunk. Let me explain this one. Every car in the US and I believe EU is required to have a spare tire, jack, and the necessary tools to change a tire. Most people have no clue these huge items are hidden in their trunk. Pull everything out, take out the lining and fill every spare space with as much fun as you can. I have seen people go so far as removing the spare tire. Note that every car is different but he point is there are some crazy clandestine spots in them that are hard as hell to get to. This is in some ways the safest route of transport.<br /><br />Hope this helped.
