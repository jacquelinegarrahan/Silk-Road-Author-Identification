				Ok, my favorite drugs are Psychedelics but I cannot take most of them any-longer due to health issues (chronic pain from from a spinal cord injury), but MDA and MDMA (thanks to SR!!!) are filling LSD and Psilocybin&#039;s place. Also I now can get Heroin witch is a much better Opiate for pain. I have yet to try Ketamine...<br /><br />mushmold

				Number two: Harm prevention. This is something that is so fucking important to me I could never express! I have had close relative(s) die due to overdose, and I think that no matter what we may personally think, we should always give the advise that gives those asking the greatest chance of not hurting themselves or others.<br /><br />mushmold

				Ketamine is nice for pain relief, but you have to keep re-dosing because it&#039;s so short acting.&nbsp; I used it when I broke my ankle.&nbsp; Methoxetamine provides pain relief that is very similar to Ketamine but is much longer acting.&nbsp; Only downside is that MXE is a research chemical so it depends on how you feel about that.&nbsp; The only reason I mention these over an opiate for pain relief is that they don&#039;t cause physical dependence.&nbsp; Psychologically they can be highly addictive though.&nbsp; Also, they are extremely cheap relative to opiates on SR.<br /><br />Like you, I absolutely love LSD and MDMA, but Ketamine is by far my favorite high.. it&#039;s just on a whole new level.&nbsp; It can cause bladder damage with frequent high doses though.

				oxymd: Thanks for your reply. Ketamine is something I plan on trying sometime. I do understand the short half-life issue. As a long term or possible life long user of pain medications (Stem Cell treatment is the only potential cure I have been told...) I know very well the fact that all drugs, well in my opinion: FUCKING suck for pain!!!<br /><br />Thank you very much for your reply.<br /><br />mushmold

				yes ketamine is amazing. its my drug of choice<br />but it cant be used for daily pain management.&nbsp; it causes hardening of the bladder walls and gives extreme abdominal and urinary track pain with chronic use.

				Hi playpiano, understandably the chronic use of any Opiate is problematic. Heroin, or DiacetylMorphine is just another Opiate drug, or at least it should be in my opinion. I certainly do not advocate the use of it, but I am very thankful to have found a source for it here on the Silk Road that prevents me from associating with street level dealers who in my area are very dangerous. And my use of it here has only been very intermittent since it is so overpriced here! Well I guess I pay for the pleasure of having it delivered to my doorstep in safety....<br /><br />mushmold<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165678.msg1173725#msg1173725">Quote from: playpiano on May 29, 2013, 03:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it is very strange reading that like being able to get heroin here. i can understand that it is better for safety but still like using on a regular basis and all of that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				So it sounds like Ketamine should only be used for occasional severe pain events. That is good information, that and the RC version.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />mushmold
