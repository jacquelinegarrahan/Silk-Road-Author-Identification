				Their website is here: http://g6lfrbqd3krju3ek.onion<br /><br />and they are listed on the hidden wiki and stuff, but I have yet to find a review from anyone that has used their IDs.&nbsp; Really looking for a &quot;backup&quot; ID so that if I need to leave the US, I can get into the EU without using my real passport - don&#039;t want to be traced and want to dissapear.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks :)<br /><br />Hopefully I&#039;ll get to 50 posts soon haha

				The vast majority of everything on the hiddenwiki is a scam. For fraudulent documentation either contact SR vendors directly or meet the right people in person. In a similar situation I found it easy to get a quality doc hook up from the immigrants behind my local home depot. This is for the US though, YMMV.

				I think you&#039;d need to do more research on these guys or at least get into contact with them before spending that much money on a fake. My question is , if they are using real info from real databases, wouldn&#039;t your picture show up if authorities just looked up the name the passport is associated with? Wouldn&#039;t that also provide a picture from their database?

				Yeah, that&#039;s my concern.. They say to avoid the country that the passport is from so that you don&#039;t run into any duplicate issues - but with how connected the EU is, I feel like that could cause a problem every time the passport is scanned.&nbsp; But, then again, I have heard that when you scan your passport (a non-US passport without the bio chip) your picture doesn&#039;t show up - it just says &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;invalid.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to check out face to face options, but I honestly have no idea where to start.&nbsp; I live near the US/Mexico border, so I suppose I should just start hunting where day-laborers hang out? Blah I wish I had a clue as to where to start with all this haha.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies so far! Any other info would be greatly appreciated.

It seems like for these type of things it&#039;s either escrow or face-to-face. Just make sure you don&#039;t get robbed haha.

				I&#039;m curious if anyone has ever actually ordered something from them and received it.<br /><br />Face to face seems just as sketchy haha.
