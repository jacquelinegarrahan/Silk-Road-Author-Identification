				I try my hardest to remain completely anonymous. I have been on SR for a while now, and I have just never been interested in making the link between the forums and my SR account. <br /><br />Did you know that google index&#039;s the forums? Well they do, and how? They do it through Tor2Web... Which is a link to the clear net. This shows me that google is implicitly trying to index the darknet. I use to be around the chat channels, but then I got wind of the compromise of the server (not hack, but infiltration by LE). Then through some sources I learned about how they are trying to gather any info they can.... from anyone. <br /><br />This may or may not be a surprise to you, but some of the tactics they use are very sinister. They try and identify you by the way you typ3. Their algorithms come from some of the top programmers, they make dirty deals. I know from first hand experience. Trying to recruit programmers in universities to do the dirty deeds. Their deals sound fantastic, wayyyy to good to be true. But, they do come through on their agreement, they are honest on that at least. <br /><br />I was offered an ungodly amount of money...I almost could not pass it up. It was a hard decision to make, but I turned down the deal for morality reasons. The idea was too sinister, it was one of the most evil and diabolical ideas I have ever heard. I do not want to go into detail, but it would infringe on humanity rights. (It was not a single government). However, through rejecting the deal, I think my life has been better than if I would have accepted.<br /><br />I turned down a crap ton of cash, just because I am an good/honest person. Good people recognize other good people. The people who can choose good over fame and money/ immunity....they are the people who truly help the world for the better. <br /><br />I know there are many programmers on this community....and I say this to you. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. It is a test, for your morality, your soul, your peace of mind. That feeling of guilt by letting down the world seems like hell to me, and thankfully, I was allowed to see past the money and fame. <br /><br />If I was DPR I would not even post in the forums. The algorithms are getting more and more advanced, and one day, who knows... An algorithm very could be able to 100% identify a person.<br /><br />I am telling everyone this because they want to know exactly who you are and what your doing...at all times. <br /><br />How to hide from them:<br />1. Do not ever have the same username/password combo -&gt; EVER<br />2. Notice how I&#039;m using alot of &quot;...&#039;s&quot; ? Next username I create I will not type like that.<br />3. Clear net users should not mention their interest in the Bitcoin economy (you will be / already are targeted).<br />4. Do not care about your numbers... (as in facebook friends, followers, money you make). It does not bring happiness. <br />5. Trust your gut feeling. This is very important, it may prevent you from some opportunities, but the protection may save your freedom. This is human instinct, just as animals that run to the hills before hurricanes occur. <br />6. Never stop learning. When you stop learning you think you know everything ( I do not even know everything, just passing on my wisdom ). Learning is as healthy to the brain as exercising is healthy to the body. <br />7. Teach yourself to think positively. This regards to the laws of attraction. <br />8. Know your Rights. Learn the law, read some of DPR&#039;s fantastic work! This can help protect yourself against many things.<br />9. Do what is right. Everyone knows deep down what is right / wrong morally. Temptation can be overwhelming, but resisting will cause a better life. <br />10. Be a chameleon. You have to know how to act around certain people. You have to blend in, change to the environment. I am not telling you to be two-faced, but watch out what you bring up. Don&#039;t mention SR in public, don&#039;t talk about drugs to people who don&#039;t seem to do them. This is part of being anonymous, blending in, being a chameleon.<br />11. This goes along with #10: If you meet someone, do not mention that you do anything that can be considered illegal first. Let them bring it up, or make a small gesture they do it. This will help you by finding people without risking yourself to disclose information about yourself.<br />12. This goes along with #6: Never stop trying to improve yourself. You want to learn more? Read about it. You want to be a better person? Learn how. -- What I am getting at is that once you stop trying, you miss out on numerous opportunities. <br />13. Last: DO NOT TALK ON THE PHONE...AT ALL. This is very important, even if your not a big time person. Keep it to &quot;Hey man, lets hang out&quot;. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave everyone this message. I am truly anonymous, but if you think you know me. It is the spirit of me you feel when reading this. <br /><br />PS: If you think this post is just a scare tactic, I feel deeply sorry for you. This is not meant to be a scare tactic, just a general incite into a universe that most do not know of / or can comprehend. Showing sources will probably get me murdered.<br /><br />PS2: I use &#039;them&#039; and &#039;they&#039;. If your eye is open, you will know what I am talking about. <br /><br />Ending transmission.............\r\n<br /><br />Sincerely, <br />_________<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You cannot just create an algorithm to stop it. <br /><br />It can only be deterred from being solved.<br /><br />Try an put this in perspective:<br /><br />It can take one machine a long time to solve one BTC. However, in multitude of clusters, coins are solved at a faster rate. The less amount of input == less amount output. The algorithm takes time to solve, and using tactics to prevent the algorithm from being true keep it from ultimately being successful. (The less amount of valid input it gets == the less amount of usable output )<br /><br />This can be replicated in this ex:<br /><br />Notice how targeted some of facebook&#039;s ads seem to be? Try liking things you don&#039;t like, sharing photo&#039;s (watch out for sharing photo&#039;s, it sends meta data :) ), join dumb and useless groups and hide them from your feed. Over time, you will start to notice that how (even more) irrelevant the ads are becoming. <br /><br />Just try and find some of your own tactics. <br /><br />So far I know they look at:<br /><br />1. Punctuation<br />2. Grammar<br />3. Capitalization<br />4. Emotion (ex: :P )<br />5. Spacing<br />6. Spelling<br /><br /><br />Also, watch out for telling people your life story. This could be very useful in identifying a person. <br /><br />
