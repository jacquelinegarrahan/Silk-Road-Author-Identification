				hey everone, cant post in the rumor mill discussion - so i&#039;m going to vent my frustration and worry here. Placed a large order with sdman on tuesday night, marked in transit 20 min later. today (thursday) i go to his vendor page and see the message &quot;i am down forever.&quot; Now, thanks to that vague and extremely scary message, i am worried about both my product and my safety. Was he compromised? Did he have an emergency? What the fuck is going on?

				Sounds like he cashed out all his BTC.&nbsp; No better time than now.&nbsp; As for you hustlin79, Sounds like you lost that 2k.&nbsp; Does SDM have your deposit address?&nbsp; If he does, you better hope it shows up sooner or later.

				Im in the same boat as you, has 3k on the way to him.&nbsp; Idk if ill ever see that money again but I have faith in sdm. Even if he did cash out hopefully he will remember all that honesty and karma he talked about on his vendor page.

				Fuck No, He ain&#039;t built like that...to just run off with peoples money. I tried to buy 4lbs from him and he wouldnt respond to me at all and take the order. It was the craziest shit. I was dealing with him even when he was off Sr. He&#039;s a stand up dude. If you don&#039;t receive your money or product its because the inevitable happen. But not because he just skipped off into the sunset with it. He probably had a number he was getting out the game at and with this recent spike in bit coin he hit his target plus some. I&#039;m shocked as fuck at that vague &quot;I&#039;m down forever&quot;, but he&#039;s a good dude. I&#039;ll leave him in my house with my life savings and grandmoms pearls on the table.

				They just have addresses and pms back and forth, no voice on the phone or anything crazy like that. Why be worried especially if you only grabbing qps and hp. No cop is coming half way across the u.s to look you up for that.

				Who are we going to use now that SDM is gone? He had the best dank to price ratio... Someone needs to step up and fulfill his place. I know of SDM orders that were received Wednesday if that&#039;s of any consolation to you guys.

				Damn he sounded like a stand up dude i hope he is ok... If he did indeed update his status to gone forever then maybe he didn&#039;t get pinched but he knows he&#039;s done... Or he updated tha before his &#039;&#039;partners&#039;&#039; snitched on him smh

				&nbsp;I just ordered a qp from OGBryan, let me be clear here-its decent. It is not however AAA, at best I gave it single A-/B+. Zero and I mean zero smell. Low bag appeal. Very tight and small. Not a single 1/10 over, spot on. It was decent. 2 me not worth his price, there is much much better. As to stealth-just a passing grade, C+/B-. You really need a couple things-a dark layer in the wrapping, and to be clear food grade vac bags are not odor impervious. I wont be a repeat customer. If the package is violated, you gotta have a dark wrap in the mix.<br /><br />One word-Unimpressive. However speedy, and weighed, and decent stuff, just on par with whats out here, and not representative of AAA Cali med.<br /><br />LucyMcgee big fan.<br />Humboldtfinest as well is decent.
