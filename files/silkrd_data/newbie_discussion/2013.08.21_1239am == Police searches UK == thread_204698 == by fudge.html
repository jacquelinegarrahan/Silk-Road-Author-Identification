				Just wondering how thorough a search would be if a dog signaled you to be carrying drugs? Are they allowed to strip search you? Or search around the crotch area?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to a festival this weekend and wondering how well you need to hide things.

				If you wrap your stuff up nice and good, you won&#039;t need to worry about any sort of searching.<br /><br />Cling-film and alcohol wipes will get almost anything through, provided you wrap as close to entering the festival as possible. Also think about putting it in your hood or under your hat, further from the dog&#039;s nose. <br /><br />The crotch is a notoriously bad place to put things because;<br />1. It&#039;s nice and warm (Mmmm...)<br />2. Constantly moving (imagine bag full of flour that you constantly squeeze, some is going to puff out eventually<br />3. It&#039;s literally perfect &#039;dog-head&#039; height, They&#039;re already pretty good at what they doo, why make it easier?<br /><br />If you do get stopped, remember that taking drugs isn&#039;t illegal per se so if they ask;<br />Have you consume xyz - Yes<br />Do you have any on you - no<br /><br />Another good idea would be to look up the thresholds for drug offences for the drugs you&#039;ll be carrying. Keeping it to the personal use levels is highly recommended. Burden of proof on you to prove you weren&#039;t planning on selling would be a real bitch.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, what are you taking in?<br />Enjoy the festival!

				Hide them well my friend. All UK festivals will have a police holding area, if the dogs alert you to there attention you will be taken in for a search. I have myself a few occasion&#039;s but never got my stash found :)<br /><br />They don&#039;t strip search without good reason, the search is usually pretty thorough though!!<br /><br />Weed is without the hardest thing to get into a festival, I personally seal mine in several smell proof bags, wipe those with alcohol and hide them in stash gadgets. <br /><br />I feel your festival concern, my stomach sinks everytime I walk into one

				I&#039;m going to a festival almost every weekend and never get caught smuggling pills or other drugs. In the Netherlands there are no dogs at the entrance so I just put it underneath my balls. Hoodie isn&#039;t a good place! They always feel in your hoody when they frisk you.

If a dog smells it and they take you for a search, would they find it if it was in your underwear? And if you dont mind me asking, where had you hidden it when they searched you and didnt find your stash?<br /><br />Cheers!

				You wont have much issues getting small amounts of MDMA in, just buy yourself some good smell proof baggies, double bag it and stash it well, in the tent or something, people often hide them in toiletries etc. If your really paranoid just plug it up ya backside, not comfortable though lol<br /><br />
