				I don&#039;t understand the connection between your three questions. But I will try:<br /><br />1) Corporations have too much money and too little accountability. &quot;Corporations are people my friend&quot;<br /><br />2) In the long time - of course. Once world war 3 (or whatever you want to call human caused global destruction) happens, America will be destroyed along with every other government on the planet. Before then? Doubtfully, the world&#039;s resources are dwindling and it&#039;s becoming nearly impossible for anyone to mass enough raw material to build a destructive force powerful enough to take on the world. The reason I say world is because at this point, if one country (say Russia) tries to take down another (say the US), the global community will step in and pool resources to force a ceasefire.<br /><br />3) The streets are paved with drugs. Every college student who wants Adderall get its. Anyone with any medical condition can get opiates. Anyone and everyone can get a prescription to benzos. Pot is recreationally legal in multiple states. Alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine are legal everywhere. I think the US is finally realizing that it&#039;s not drugs that are the problem, is the violent cartels that push them that are the real danger. Cocaine (usually) doesn&#039;t kill people. AK-47s (usually) do kill people.

America&#039;s problem right now is it&#039;s corruption and the disregard of it. A lot of it is do to private prisons and a failing democracy system. <br /><br />2). The government will never be destroyed. A lot of bad things happen like privacy invasions and stuff like that, but we are no where near collapse. Our government has yet to give people enough reasoning to over throw them, and they are way to organized to simply collapse.<br /><br />3). Depending on where you live the streets are already paved with drugs. Although no where near as bad as in some parts of Europe and so on. Where I live we have no drug problems, the only way I actually am able to get drugs is through the SR. So if you asked me if the streets were paved in drugs here I would say know. Infact there was a drug dealer who parked on our little street(It&#039;s a 1way rode so no one has a reason to be there unless they live here). He walked down a little trail to do whatever, and low and behold a neighbor of ours, a real stand up guy, spray painted the guys car saying something like &quot;Don&#039;t park here&quot; or something implying he was not welcome. The man knocked on my door and asked my sister if she knew who did it. We have a close community here so no one said. Moral of the story here is, white neighbor hoods are pretty drug free.

				This argument could go on for days...<br />The argument that all empires rise and fall and the U.S. is no longer a superpower isn&#039;t really a valid argument any longer. In reality empires and superpowers no longer exist. <br /><br />Military: yes, U.S. military is something to be feared, however, if anyone has ever really studied military / intelligence power they (just my opinion) should realize that Israel is the one to be feared. Even the US won&#039;t mess with them. They are surrounded by enemies, they don&#039;t have a choice but to be brutal. I&#039;m not saying I support their tactics, I don&#039;t!!!<br /><br />The U.S., undoubtedly, has many, many issues. Too many to count really. It is one of the few places in the world that you can speak your mind and not fear persecution... unless it&#039;s hate speech.&nbsp; Really lobbyists rule the government, certainly congress and the president do not. That is just sad. But I don&#039;t care where you are in the world no government is perfect and it never will be.<br /><br />Honestly, this could go on and on... No anger, just stating facts

				For me the one remarkable thing about America is the Americans themselves.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure they are nice people but sometimes absolutely ignorant to anything outside America.<br /><br />Then take Obama and a lot of the politicians now caught in their own lies due to Snowden&#039;s leaked info.<br /><br />In my own personal opinion, American government has taken the role of being the worlds policeman far more seriously than running and protecting their own country and citizens.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure most remember the fiasco about chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction so the American government could rape and pillage yet another country. Sometimes their lies are so transparent.<br /><br />China IS the biggest threat to America, they produce the highest quality products now at the lowest prices, they also produce very low quality when asked for it. They own more of America than Americans do. They are the biggest English speaking country in the world bar none. They don&#039;t need to borrow money they have zillions of spare cash and 100&#039;s of thousands of highly trained people in IT and 100&#039;s of Millions it can call into the military.<br /><br />If ever there was a threat to America China is it. Luckily for America, China has absolutely no interest in being the worlds police but if America ever challenges China I know where I will be moving to and it won&#039;t be America that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents worth on this debate lol<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />BTC4Cash<br />

				not be the typical &#039;merican, but our milatary is quite powerful. when they built the navy&#039;s fleet the goal was to eclispe the power of the next 5 most powerful navys combined. i believe the other forces, except coast guard followed the same doctrine. of course thats the reason we are so in debt. america may not be the superpower it once was but, it&#039;s still not to be triffled with. the only reason israel is still there is our backing. not that israel isn&#039;t a totally badass in terms of military. and the only reason we back them is to have an ally in the middle east. i personally hate america&#039;s foreign policy, and if anything thats the most likely reason (imho) america might fall. from what&nbsp; can tell, the &quot;help and support&quot; we get is just a token unit or two.<br /><br />&nbsp;i absolutely agree btc4cash, china is likely to be the next world dominating super power. it&#039;s got the people, it&#039;s got the industry, it&#039;s got the complete dissregard form human rights.

China is ripe for another revolution, especially in the north east. The former revolutionaries of the peoples republic in their rust belt feel cheated as their factory jobs have moved south and in the south young people are moving from rural villages with minimum wages promised by the state but not met by the state sponsored factories. Even in official government&nbsp; reports protest are high. That is not to say the states aren&#039;t getting there the majority of our peeps are too comfortable right now though.
