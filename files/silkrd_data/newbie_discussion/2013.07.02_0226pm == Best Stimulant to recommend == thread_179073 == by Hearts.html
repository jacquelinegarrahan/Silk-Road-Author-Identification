				So i&#039;ve in all honesty never tried any stimulants, aside from MDMA which in my opinion isn&#039;t too much of a stimulant..<br /><br />Dropping my spaghetti and saying that I&#039;d prefer If it was cheap and is still worth the high, since I&#039;ve recently received a couple of orders for DMT, Hash, Ecstasy... I&#039;m a bit low on my &#039;money to blow&#039; for a while on drugs. What do you guys think about Mephedrone? I was thinking about Meth but I don&#039;t think its worth it.. I am aware that most stimulants are very addictive but I would just like to experiment. <br /><br />So... Whats the best stimulant YOU recommend?

				In my opinion Mephedrone isn&#039;t the way to go! Some people might disagree with that but I just dont like the high or the burning on the nose!<br /><br />Meth I have never done so cant really advise!<br /><br />When it comes to stimulants i personally don&#039;t think you can beat good quality coke, although its not really a cheap option!

				I personally like MrOuids Ice pills. It&#039;s a mix of amp and meth, but mostly amp. I haven&#039;t really found any tests on his pills to know the exact mixture, and I&#039;d like to know.

				A lot of good ideas here from the community already....if my head was totally clear and hadn&#039;t been dipping into the stimulant cookie jar every day for many days now, the best stimulant euphoria I have experienced came from 30mg mixed-amphetamine salt Adderalls...perhaps surpassing this, but harder to procure is&nbsp; Dexedrine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty much the King of the RX stims, IMO.&nbsp; 2 other RX stimulants that gave me plenty of pleasure back in the day are Ritalin and a hard to find diet pill called Didrex.&nbsp; &nbsp;Didrex metabolizes into methamphetamine in the liver...and so produces some similar effects. <br /><br />If you want to delve into the grey market of Research Chemicals you can find a lot of winners...some favorites of mine are A-PVP,&nbsp; 3-MMC, MDPV, MOPPP, MDPPP, 4-FMC (flephedrone), and 2-FA<br /><br />Although is has some MDMA-lite qualities, a solid, solid stimulant for the price right now is Methylone (M1). <br /><br />These research chemicals are very popular for their stimulant properties but I they make me yawn:&nbsp; &nbsp;4-FA, 2-FMA, and Butylone<br /><br />Just my two cents for now.......cheers and good luck.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen Meth mentioned - I&#039;ve seen first hand what that does to people, steer clear of that!!<br /><br />I actually found Ritalin a very good stimulant to be honest, didn&#039;t want to make me want to dance, made me want to enjoy and focus on things.<br /><br />Still a big user of Ritalin (it&#039;s supposed to be for people with ADHD), but if you are without it, it is great. Kinda like a coke buzz, but safe. I don&#039;t snort Ritalin btw, just swollow and wait!<br /><br />If you want mg recommendations let me know once you have some..... It&#039;s also ALOT cheaper than Adderall (however, it is true, it is about 30% less buzz, deciding on the amount of Ritalin you take that is). But if you get into the habbit of Ritalin being in your daily lifestyle (like me now - for focus and good feelings) it can become quite expensive.<br /><br />I guess some people have benzos, me? I have Ritalin (and I spread it out throughout the day so I can work - and you won&#039;t believe the amount of focus it gives you throughout the day if taken in smaller doses - maybe I do have a bit of ADHD lol.)<br /><br />But my overall recomendation has to be stay away from the drugs that can take over your life - sorry to the user above, but Meth is one of those.

Also out of topic, but are oxy&#039;s expensive on SR? i&#039;ve never tried any opiates TBH, even considered getting heroin to chase the dragon, but i don&#039;t know if i should.. <br /><br />I swear if silk road was a shopping mall, I would live in there.

				&nbsp;Enough Ritalin (60-70mg) will give you a real real buzz (if you crushed it and snorted it, wow you&#039;d have a great time)<br /><br />10/20mg a few times throughout the day will make you get stuff done - you wouldn&#039;t believe the amount of anti-government reading I have been doing while on Ritalin throughout the day haha. It focuses me so much it is unreal - but it might not be the case for everyone.<br /><br />Don&#039;t chase the dragon mate, that is another slippery slope. Especially with that, I have been told by users that the first hit is the most amazing thing you will ever feel. However as the years go on they destroy themselves looking for that high again, which is never found.<br /><br />The people I know that took H are no long in my life, one is dead and one lives by the freeway. Lost his house and family. Extreme cases I know, but having seen so much and tried so much related to drugs I thought I would share.<br /><br />But, I must be fair and say I have never tried H or Meth at all. I steer clear.

It focuses me so much it is unreal - but it might not be the case for everyone.<br /><br />Don&#039;t chase the dragon mate, that is another slippery slope. Especially with that, I have been told by users that the first hit is the most amazing thing you will ever feel. However as the years go on they destroy themselves looking for that high again, which is never found.<br /><br />The people I know that took H are no long in my life, one is dead and one lives by the freeway.

Hmm i might get some ritalin to try out and if it is beneficial for me It&#039;l be good for when I have to study :) Modafinil Doesn&#039;t seem too bad either! but anyways both are more for focusing and work, in the mean time i might get amphetamine paste just to give it a try, but is it supposed to be smoked/vaporized? hmmm...

Didn&#039;t that rapper pull his eye out with a fork while high on meth??<br /><br />Will find the link if people want it!!<br /><br />Also not sure if it can be done as a recreational drug - don&#039;t users become dependant?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It kinda depends on a person&#039;s personality, some people just CAN&#039;T get enough. For me personally, I smoke it a few times until I get bored of getting high and stop, and then when I feel like getting high again I smoke some meth. The times in between getting high has varied greatly, sometimes it&#039;s a few days or a week or maybe even a few months or years. It all just depends on where I&#039;m at in life. I never reached a point where I needed to decide to never get high again and then have to struggle with my decision. IMHO if someone needs to decide whether to live with or without it because they feel meth is controlling their life then they definitely got a problem. . .

				Alright guys I have another question, lets say I&#039;d want to get a study aid drug, something to improve my focus, possibly organize my thoughts, which would be better and why<br /><br />&nbsp;modafinil or ritalin ?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about these 2 drugs and have done some research on drugs forums and bluelight, but I would like to know if anyone on the road with personal experience can give me some info?<br /><br />Much appreciated

				I&#039;ve injected meth. DO NOT DO IT.<br /><br />The first time is so fucking amazing you&#039;ll never be satisfied. Then when you quit, Week 1 cravings are equally as bad as Month 6 cravings. It never goes away man. It&#039;s not worth a day of being amazing.

				This is a re-post of my sentiments, from another thread asking about stims, or meth..w.e, It will shed some light on how nice meth can be, when used responsibly<br /><br />I only snort, i do it as often as i can afford, again, almost always for work or to stay awake when i cant otherwise. The magical mood and euphoria are just major pluses for me. Only with the real deal holyfield will you feel the goodness of it. All the shit thats stepped hard with msm is basically all the ups, minus the goodness, plus angst and noia.<br /><br />I often cap some, eat it, forget about it, crawl into work, then before i know it, im superman on the table saw, lol.

The shit is rocket fuel. Perfect case &amp; point, is me, right now. I got my order yesterday at 2ish, did a residue line(w.e shook out the bags when splitting and weighing it), It couldnt have been more than 5-10mg.

Worked like the flash for 9 hrs straight, no lunch, no breaks. Only cigs, redbull and water of coarse, important to keep hydrated, as it dryss you the fuuck out. Did a booster dose, maybe 20mg at about 130pm...as of right now, on ZERO food, hardly any sleep and loads of hard labor, i feel like a million bucks, arguing with the voices in my head about how do NOT NEED another snap.

				Mephedrone gives me an amazing high, crazy music appreciation, love for everything, myself even lol. I just can&#039;t stay still, feel like I must dance, or just do anything I wouldn&#039;t normally do e.g. cleaning my room :D But it lasts only for 1 hour or so. This is the peak, I still feel kinda good for an hour. There was really little comedown for me, I slept well a few hours after. No headaches or anything. I could easily eat too.<br />I had Ritalin LA 30 mg, I snorted it once and it was nice but nothing special really. I&#039;ve also used it as a study aid. Stayed up all night, done the work that&#039;s it.<br />Lately I&#039;ve been interested in Modafinil too, might try it when school time rolls around.

				Adderall is pretty fantastic, IMO. I haven&#039;t purchased any on here, but I have several friends with prescriptions. Kinda awesome... they end up with anywhere from 5-30mg/day and most of time don&#039;t use half of it. They all have massive stashes and often share with me and my friends for cheap (or free).<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s awesome enough to pay $10-$20 for a 20mg pill, though. I take 5-10mg from time to time to get shit done, and 10-20mg for fun euphoric times. I am a lightweight. ;)

				&quot;amphetamine paste&quot; just means wet amphi; spread it on a plate and leave it to dry for a couple hours, then you can snort, dab on gums, parachute, or inject as preferred. There&#039;s no point smoking it really, in fact it&#039;d be wasteful. Base would need to be smoked but I&#039;ve never seen amph base, if I remember correctly it&#039;s not generally used but converted into the regular powder (amphetamine salts)

				Hey Hearths, after reading through this page and your responses I would personally suggest amphetamine! I&#039;m not a stim freak but I&#039;m telling you. I&#039;m really starting to get to love amph. If you get some higher quality stuff it&#039;s like a completely different drug. I had some super pure amph a little while ago that was all crystals and had no smell what so ever. The euphoria was almost equal to when doing mdma.

You only need a little heat to dry it effectively (like putting the plate on a radiator. don&#039;t fry it lol)

				I&#039;m glad I could be of help Hearths! Hmm well amphetamine differs a lot in purity but I find it really easy to eye ball. But I would say start with maybe 50mg or so and work your way up. I always snort my stuff since I love snorting and it has a faster onset so I also find it a little easier to dose that way. Hope you have a great time man :)

				Yeah, I too would defo recommend some speed if you just want a taste of drug-induced stimulation. The purity does differ immensely, but for value for money, length of buzz etc, you can&#039;t go wrong (unless you end up getting addicted of course, be careful). You can do speed paste even without drying it. Just stick 50-200 mg in a rizla and enjoy your day! I&#039;ve yet to try Meth so can&#039;t comment there.<br />Mephedrone/Mdma are good, but don&#039;t last me long enough, leading to constant re-dosing.<br />Only done coke twice, so am no expert, but if you have money to burn it&#039;s a more mellow, natural high than speed. Doesn&#039;t last long though. Same with crack.

				Sorry for sounding overly obtuse or theoretical here...but what is it you guys are actually referring to as &#039;amphetamine?&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you you referring to &#039;d-amphetamine&#039; that is the active ingredient in Dexedrine?&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s also &quot;levoamphetamine&#039; which can be found in Adderall and Benzedrine.&nbsp; &nbsp; Adderall XR is said to contain as the main ingredient &#039;mixed amphetamine salts.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then of course there&#039;s the molecular cousins of amphetamine such as methamphetamine, 4-fluroampthetmaine (4-FA), and 2-fluromethamphetamine (2-FMA)...(to name a few) that are made in labs not for pharmaceutical use, necessarily.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m assuming when people refer to &quot;amphetamine&quot; in a general sense (like amphetamine paste), they are referring to a lab based concoction, and not a pharmaceutical product.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For instance &quot;Ice&quot;...is that just a slang term for lab created methamphetamine?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I just wanted to get the definitions a little more precise...if that&#039;s even possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for your help and input everybody.....

				Cocaine for sure. <br /><br />With a smooth rush and easy comedown its has become my expensive habit that I use/d from pulling all-nighters with work/studies, partying and even playing video games. Can´t spoil yourself with it too much though - its a quite addictive high, so having some rules is recommended (e.g. once a month etc)<br /><br />This comes from a 3-year casual user.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bluehorn

When I said put it in a rizla, I didn&#039;t mean to smoke! You just wrap the paste in a rizla, and swallow it with water. Should last you the whole day. I think you should put aside any thoughts of smoking amphetamine paste/powder. It just can&#039;t be done, not like meth.<br /><br />While i&#039;ve been recommending speed as a good start off point, you should be aware that as a 1st timer, the comedown will be massive and you will feel terrible the day after. Coke has a much smoother comedown. Just some points to bear in mind!

				If you have self control then methamphetamine all the way. Try not to redose and always have benzos on hand for your comedown.<br /><br />Second I would choose really good cocaine. I think the euphoria is better with good coke but I&#039;ve yet to try IV or smoking crystal. Just can&#039;t do it.

				Yeah, benzos and cannabis (if it&#039;s to your liking) are the best things for combating the dreaded comedown. Sedative anti-psychotic drugs are handy to have around too, as they can help you sleep through the comedown, meaning you will feel almost back to normal by the time you wake up. I once knew a smackhead who said his favorite part of doing speed was smoking dope on the comedown because it replicated the effects of heroin. Can&#039;t say i&#039;ve ever had the same feeling as him, but smoking dope after doing speed/mdma feels great.

				I&#039;m not sure that the OP would be advised to start off with MPDV. That shit is hardcore.

				Hmmmm, perhaps i&#039;m recommending speed because it&#039;s my personal fave. It&#039;s a dirty drug though, with lots of unpleasant side-effects. At least cocaine is more natural, and probably safer too. It just doesn&#039;t have the longevity or value for money that good quality speed has, in my opinion,
