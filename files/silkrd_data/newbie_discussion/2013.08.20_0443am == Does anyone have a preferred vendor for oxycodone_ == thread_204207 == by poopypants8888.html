				So I found a couple sources on here and most seem pretty expensive which is okay I suppose. Paying more and actually getting something is better than paying cheaper and getting nothing (planet express)...<br /><br />I guess after getting fucked the other day, I am kind of wary about purchasing from vendors that don&#039;t have a lot of feedback yet.<br /><br />So back to my topic, does anyone have a preferred vendor for oxy/perc/etc?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I&#039;ve purchased from drxtc recently and everything went flawlessly; I&#039;ll probably continue to use him. The only negative is that he ships from Canada rather than the U.S. but he has better prices than anybody else (roughly $.75/mg).<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a friend order from darkherbalincense (I believe that&#039;s the username.. it&#039;s close to that. He sells 5mg tabs with the imprint 512 for about $6/each).<br /><br />For some reason painkillers are WAY overpriced on SR.. it sucks.

				Hey thank you for the response!!<br /><br />Yeah, I didn&#039;t even think to uncheck &#039;domestic only&#039;... I don&#039;t think I would purchase out of the EU but Canada doesn&#039;t sound too suspicous... You say you&#039;ve always had good luck with that vendor? I will definitely check him/her out....<br /><br />Thanks again:)

				No problem. I usually don&#039;t order from anywhere but the U.S. but I figured Canada was close enough, and I was right. Shipping was VERY fast and his stealth is the best I&#039;ve ever seen on the road. I was very surprised at his stealth. <br /><br />
