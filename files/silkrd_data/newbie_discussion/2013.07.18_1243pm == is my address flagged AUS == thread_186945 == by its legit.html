				Do your best to find out if you are under investigation, little bit of counter surveillance is useful, be very hard to have anything sent to anything attached to your name now they have their in knowing you are a supplier. They will usualy Let/watch you make several deals before picking you up so stay vigilant and play it safe. $7bn a year industry in Australia alone, don&#039;t miss out on your slice while inside!!

How many arrests do you think were made 10 days ago where a woman was arrested on suspicion of possessing a large quantity of drugs, her phone confiscated which led Police to finding some info. on her supplier?? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; there was info In her phone that led to me being the supplier&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How do you know this??? Were you questioned by the Police or arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled substance?????<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. If you were suspected of being the &quot;supplier&quot;, the Police would have raided your place by now, especially if they arrested someone on suspicion of possessing large quantities of drugs and found incriminating info on her phone about her supplier. People caught with large quantities rarely, if at all, get bail so I would love to know how you managed to gather all this information while coming to the attention of the Police as a potential supplier? <br />If the Police do suspect you&#039;re involved in drug supply and have info. on you from a person arrested on suspicion of possessing large quantities of drugs, you would have to be retarded to order anything, especially to your current address. All sounds like bullshit to me as it doesn&#039;t make any sense! <br /><br />
