				Hi!<br /><br />I was thinking about purchasing some lsd, weed and xtc to norway, but I was wondering if anyone has any experiences with the shipping? Is there a big risk of the packages getting taken at the customs? What happens if they do? Will I get in lots of problems, or does it work to just deny deny deny?<br /><br />I will only buy for myself, not to sell to other.

				Hi Per!<br /><br />I have never purchased MDMA or weed, but haven&#039;t had any problems with customs when buying LSD or powdered stuff. I&#039;d love to, but I&#039;m a bit hesitant my self to buy weed from vendors outside of Norway. I&#039;d say powder(low amount) and blotters are relatively safe.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what happens if&nbsp; you get caught, but you probably have to have a little chat with the police:)<br />

				I agree with Somnia about the LSD and small amounts of powder, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be any problems getting it through customs.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re afraid, why don&#039;t you just order domestic? Little to no chance it&#039;s getting cought by customs then.<br />If your package gets caught by customs, you of course deny having any knowlegde of it! As long as they can&#039;t trace the order and/or the payment back to you, it&#039;s not much they can do. But to be safe, order from inside Norway, both weed and xtc (mdma/mda) is availeble from Norwegian vendors here on SR.

				I order only from outside of Norway, you should NOT be afraid of doing so, I belive we overestimate the customs myself :-)<br /><br />I have experience ordering powders &amp; cannabis in form of solids, extracts &amp; plant.<br /><br />Vendors I reccomend so far is vendor Wehkampf, Budsupplies &amp; Globalshipping for cannabis, and so far Amsterdope for Amphetamine.<br /><br />Shoot me a PM for any questions, I am happy to answer.<br /><br />The rules for getting seized packages I guess counts for us also! DENY! Unless you have been really sketchy and not doing it safely they have NO PROOF, ANYONE can send you crap in the mail!<br /><br />-JUR&nbsp; 8)
