				Title: <strong>cancelling order</strong><br />

				Thinking about cancelling an order and going with another vendor because of several reviews of pack&#039;s not showing up. I want to go with a new vendor, and will be able to cancel my order tomorrow since it will still be in processing for four days. Is there any penalty I take by cancelling my order? loss of bitcoins? buyer stats?<br /><br />TL;DR: What are the negative consequences of cancelling an order after it has sat in processing for 4+ days??

He lost a ton of packs.&nbsp; AbsoluteFinest?&nbsp; Scammed a couple people on FE scams.<br /><br />Who... is an important question for everyone to know?&nbsp; Some of us might know if that particular vendor is in good standing or not. ;)

				We gotta play by the rules and vendors should too. If your order sits long enough for cancellation to become an option for you then thats it, there shouldn&#039;t be any adverse consequences whatsoever. Thats not to say you might get a vindictive vendor, but, I&#039;d bet if you messaged them and was up front with the vendor you should have no issues.
