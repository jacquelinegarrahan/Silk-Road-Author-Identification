				I received a blackmailing letter today - in which I am being informed that my name, address and transactions on SR were safed before the shutdown!<br /><br />Furthermore I am being asked to send Money (via BTC) within 3 days, otherwise my name, address and transactions will be released in other public forums on darknet, to other vendors there and as evidence to the police.<br /><br /><br />I did not buy very much on SR, so I am not that worried - and the vendors I bought from are only a few ... and all domestic (the blackmailing letter was written in broken german).<br /><br /><br />Did anyone else receive such a letter?<br />What would you do in my position?
