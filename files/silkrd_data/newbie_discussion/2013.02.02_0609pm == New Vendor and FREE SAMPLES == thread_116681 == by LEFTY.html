				anyone else think a new vendor giving free samples for reviews is shit? <br />i can understand discounted great deal pricing for the first 10 peeps or something but fkn FREE?<br />there is always a line of familiar faces ready to lick the inside of an asshole in these free threads so how can you get a real review that way?<br />giving someone something for nothing and asking me to believe its an honest review is just plain stupid.<br />

				Like all business legal and otherwise always promo $$$ involved.. consider it like opening a store selling hot dogs but you advertise in the newspapers to announce your arrival.all cost $$$&nbsp; when you go to wallymart you see the reps handing out free food bits&nbsp; same thing here..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				nothing wrong with advertising and saying come get a hotdog and coke for $1... but free?<br />if you know what you have is good there is no need to give it away<br />maybe it would stop the *I&#039;ll suck you dick to get more* free reviewer flies around here<br /><br />

				East Coast......IDK....those are not the same......I understand building a base of clients and what it takes to do that.......Have been in this biz for many years....just new to SR....<br />for the life of me....I can not understand why someone from the East Coast with Mary Jane would need SR....you prices are already higher than what I have seen on SR....and growing there is way harder than where I am at.......most of my customers are from the east coast.....and that is what I am looking for more connections.....IDK good luck......Being a grower for over 25 years......I have the product......just looking for more loyal...legit...customers who appreciate high grade medical cannibas.

				Vendors that will give free samples are great. I had to place like 6 orders from 6 different vendors before I found the 2 vendors I want work with on a regular basis. Only 2 vendors out of the 8 would send me free samples and their stuff was the best out of the 8 vendors. It gets costly having to place 6 orders for small amounts of anything.

I will buy a sample at the reasonable price to try and if I like the deal I will continue to buy. See it&#039;s easy! Put a link to your SR page in your sig. Keep telling your story in your review/promote thread and knowledge of your product. Price your product correctly and do something special here and there. Then follow up with great customer service and you will be busy.<br />

				Free is a relative term.&nbsp; As someone who has and does reviews of samples I don&#039;t think it&#039;s free.&nbsp; Every time I provide a new vendor an address I&#039;m putting my ass and that address at risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve gotten samples expertly packaged as well as some that I&#039;m amazed arrived.&nbsp; There are a lot of moving parts with an order on SR, security, packaging, shipping and then we can start talking about the actual product.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just my .02btc <br /><br />

				What if there was a group with a lab that objectively tested each sample from these vendors? Such as the LSD Avengers.

				I don&#039;t see why anybody would object to this unless they were also a vendor, trying to compete with the vendors giving out free shit, and mad cause they don&#039;t wanna give away freebies.
