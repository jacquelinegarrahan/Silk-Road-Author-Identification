				I was just wondering about how literally this thread should be taken?<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />I ordered some acid off NeuroticNarcotic, and it was apparently good stuff. It had a quick come-up (30-60 mins) and a very clear experience, lasting 7-8 hours. I ordered from him without checking the forums first, using his ratings as a guide.<br /><br />However, in the aforementioned thread I found the vendor listed as a bad one. <br />Judging by the short duration of the come-up, and the fact that the blotter was small, I have somewhat concluded that it couldn&#039;t have been anything else than LSD. However, being quite new to psychedelics I have a feeling that you can never know for sure, which somewhat inhibits me from taking the other blotter.<br /><br />So, my question is: How much should one trust this thread? Does it really tell more than lots of positive reviews?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				First thing stop using the SWIM thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are already on an anonymous drug forum.&nbsp; &nbsp;SWIM just tells people to stop reading your post because the SWIM is so annoying.<br /><br />The avengers thread is a GREAT RESOURCE for sure....BUT it is not the absolute truth and 100% scamproof.&nbsp; &nbsp;LSD scams were rampant when I first joined the road almost 2 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;The avengers thread was started by some that were sick of watching people get scammed.&nbsp; <br />You still need to use your judgement on what you are reading.....but I think they can help point you in the right direction to finding a legitimate source of LSD that you seek.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Some vendors have selective scamming to prolong there ability to scam.&nbsp; &nbsp; Send some real product and send others bunk or don&#039;t send at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are just trying to keep selling as long as possible to keep the scam going to gain the most profit.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t order from any vendor they have listed as BAD.&nbsp; &nbsp; Go with the STAR vendors they list.&nbsp; &nbsp;My number 1 favorite is JoR--JesusofRave<br />Also albinoessentials is back and is HIGHLY regarded by those in the know.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Remember positive reviews can be faked.&nbsp; &nbsp;So can posts on forum threads but if you read the avengers thread you see some of the same people posting and you learn to trust their opinions.

				Man the Avengers LSD thread is amazing. My only gripe with the list is that Tesselated should be added to the star vendor list. I mean the guy is professional, very easy to talk to, reasonable, has ninja stealth, competitive prices, and has yet to let me down. Do this guy/girl a solid and put them up their with the other greats. I know I wen&#039;t off on a rant their but yea..... The Avengers thread is an excellent resource for buying LSD. I want to try out JoR&#039;s ToR after I finish off Tesselated WoW.

				Thanks jackstraw! Good point about the SWIM thing, I just thought it was the thing to do for some reason, but upon reflection it is obviously unnecessary.<br /><br />And, thank you very much for answering my questions! I&#039;ve ordered off Jesusofrave now, and it is quite nice to know that I can be confident it&#039;s 100% what I think it is, as I must admit that after taking the blotter from NeuroticNarcotic I did some intensive online research to assure myself I hadn&#039;t ingested any RCs. Sadly, I found the avengers thread AFTER ordering off him, however I am quite sure it wasn&#039;t anything else than LSD, as most adulterants have far longer come-ups, and longer durations as far as my googling could tell me. I still have one blotter left of NeuroticNarcotic&#039;s&nbsp; so if you have any advice towards it might being something else than LSD with the characteristics (30min-1hr come-up, 7-8 hours duration) I described, that would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />All the best
