				OK, I haven&#039;t had anything with MDMA in it for more than 10 years, but I have my memories of the 90s.<br /><br />In the 90s the pills definitely had MDMA in them, and some of them probably had speed as well, because on some pills you just felt super-charged.<br /><br />My question is this: What would be the appropriate amount of speed in such a pill or capsule were I to make one? For example, MDMA 120mg and speed how many mg?

				Ah the pills of the 90s! - such sweet memories.<br />Used to mix pills and speed a lot in those days - when i used to get speckled doves it was the only thing&nbsp; that could get you on your feet.<br />I guess its really dependent on how speedy you want the hit to be - what situation will you be taking it in?<br />Best advice I can think is to ingest mandy as normal , measure out some 10 mg bumps and when she kicks in bump yourself to the head level you are looking for.<br />Then next time you can mix the two and get yourself straight there. :-)<br /><br />p.s - pills of the nineties - speckled doves. riddlers, red bulls, califonia sunshines........ah those were the days!

				A lot of times there is speed in XTC/E pills...<br /><br />I prefer pure (and tested) mdma crystals with clean speed. <br />And then alcohol, lsd, 2cb and if needed a benzo.

				Ah yes, the &quot;E&quot; pills of the early 90s...<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I ever had one with any MDMA in it.<br />A few had meth in. At the time I assumed those must be the good ones.

				I heard that before, in the 90&#039;s, that there could be meth in pills or that some speed could be meth.<br /><br />But when I look at the prices for meth I get confused.

				The closest trips I&#039;ve had to those 90&#039;s MDMA rolls really seem to come from MDA. The two are really similar but subtly different. I think everyone gets sold on the pure MDMA thing as being the best but when I took it way back when there was definitely more to it than I get off a clean MDMA roll today. Could just be my body chemistry, tolerance, age, diet, or whatever though. I think my next order is going to be for just a little meth to add to the roll and see what that does for it. I always joke with my girlfriend that I feel like such a fucking scientist whenever we do drugs, weighing stuff out, trying different combinations, doing all this research :-&gt; It&#039;s all fun though so try everything!
