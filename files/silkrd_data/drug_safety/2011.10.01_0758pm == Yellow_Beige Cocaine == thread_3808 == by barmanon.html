				This is not a current issue that I have, but back in high school my friends and I used to get a regular supply of blow that had a distinct yellow color to it.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not talking about a slight hue or reflections in the light, but solid yellow color.&nbsp; It was kind of muted/beige-y, not bright or anything like that, but we always wondered what was so different about it since I&#039;ve never seen anything quite like it since.<br /><br />It was actually very decent for what youngsters could find in the midwest, and it came at a great price (I think we paid about $100/ball, and this was about 10 years ago).&nbsp; Some of the other (white and normal looking) stuff we&#039;d find in rich mountain towns would go for $80/gram and it was about as good.&nbsp; It also had a very strong numbing on the nose and throat, rocked up nice and all that.&nbsp; In fact, the numbing was so strong, I&#039;ve puked when trying to smoke weed after a few lines because my throat was so numb....<br /><br />I&#039;m simply wondering if anyone can share some insight as to how it might have gotten like that?&nbsp; Strange cuts? Processing?&nbsp; Like I said, not a current issue that I&#039;m wondering whether or not to snort some stuff I have, but I would like to hear input from any resident experts...

				I&#039;v never seen &quot;yellowish&quot; coke, but I&#039;v had my share of pinkish!<br />I&#039;v read somewhere -can&#039;t verify though- that &quot;pure&quot; cocaine is actually supposed to be yellow... <br />

				Everytime I&#039;ve had the ivory/yellowish product it&#039;s been very strong.<br />The batch I bought from MIN was like that. <br /><br />but It can also be tinted from cutting with b12 I think.<br /><br />Whenever I get a package that yellow and clumpy<br />I&#039;m a happy man.

				Pure cocaine hydrochloride is totally white. It&#039;s a crystal and it doesn&#039;t smell of anything harsh - in fact, it smells quite nice. Cocaine hydrochloride hydrolyzes in moist air to give methyl benzoate - which is what drug dogs are trained to smell. This is the odour most cocaine veterans know well. <br /><br />Want to find out for yourself? Do an acid/base extraction ... even an acetone / water wash will give you a very good idea, provided you let the acetone evaporate :-)<br /><br />Anything other smell or color will be as a result of adulterants (active/inactive cutters)<br /><br />
