				I have bought meth on campus many times and have tried two of the vendors on here, both had great product.&nbsp; My question is what should meth taste like?&nbsp; In my opinion it has and should always have a salty taste when you dab just a tiny bit on your toungue.&nbsp; You will of course taste that same taste in the drip.&nbsp; The meth I had today had a salty taste but also a strong sour tone.&nbsp; I liked the effect of the product so I did not complain.&nbsp; It seemed calmer than regular meth but alert and energetic but not so wired and even triggered empathy.&nbsp; My buddy is thinking maybe it was cut with something like methylone but that seems a bit stupid to me cuz methlyone aint any cheaper for the cook.&nbsp; Any suggestions guys?&nbsp; Maybe my taster was just off?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				OK firstly, stop sniffing your meth! Use a water filtration smoking method! This way you won&#039;t rot your teeth. Sniffing it is a massive waste. But yeah when you taste a dab on your tongue it should taste salty and chemically. When you smoke it however it should taste sweet. the best way to describe it I guess is kind of like smoking Haribo but without the fruit taste (gummy fruit sweets). That will sound weird to anyone who hasn&#039;t smoked Meth or Yaba before but to those who have you will know what I&#039;m on about ;D<br /><br />In conclusion - Salty and bitter to taste orally, and a sweet and kind of fruity/sugary flavour when smoked.

				I love the taste, could just be the associated feeling though.<br /><br />Mmm Yaba, got onto a bit of that when I was in Laos... tasty, tasty vanilla.

But why not buy a cheap pipe, purpose made.
