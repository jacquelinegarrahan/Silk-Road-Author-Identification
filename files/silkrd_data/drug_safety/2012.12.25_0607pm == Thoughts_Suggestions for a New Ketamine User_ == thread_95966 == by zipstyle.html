				No needles, in b4 needle comments.<br /><br />I have been curious for quite some time about ketamine, though I&#039;ve never had a chance to try it. What are people&#039;s thoughts on K? I have tried MXE in the past and thought it was nice, but it seems like K is the classic favorite. Is K nice in low doses for a lil fuck-me-up, trip-me-out?<br /><br />Looking forward to your suggestions, comments and so forth!

				K is certainly nice in low doses for your purposes. Start with small bumps and see where it takes you. At low doses it also goes great with weed, lsd &amp; mdma, adding a spacey, trippy edge. At high doses it&#039;s quite the experience and can give you full blown disassociation and trips to places you&#039;ve never imagined before.

				I&#039;m also about to try some K for the first time, got a gram of isomer-S off SR. However, the last thing I want is snorting or injecting this shit.. so I&#039;ll just dilute it in some warm water and gulp it down. According to Erowid, a gram should be about 3-5 strong doses, or 2 &quot;K-Hole&quot; doses :)<br /><br />

				A gram of&nbsp; racemic Indian shard will last me months. I do a match head at a time and wait 5-10 minutes in between bumps as the stuff is very strong and hits hard. Someone posted about doing a half gram for a &quot;k-hole&quot; experience, that would kill me I think. Go slow until you get your feet wet. <br />&nbsp;K is kind of hard on the stomach at higher doses. Lots of fun though, may want to try the first few times at home in a relaxed position.

				Ket becomes very trippy psychedelic combined with weed, time slows down, open eye visuals- there was a gremlin sitting beside my PC monitor, seeing my bones flashing underneath my skin, like xray vision. moreso sativa-like strains though.<br /><br />combining with something that causes you to revert into yourself and away from the outside world is great when combined with something that gives euphoria..<br />whats K+MDMA called, Robo-flipping?

				I&#039;ve only tried it one time while I was rolling on MDMA and I didn&#039;t really know what I was supposed to feel, I eventually stood up and felt kinda dizzy or &quot;drunk&quot; in a way, and the effects died off after like 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; I only had a small key bump someone offered me.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting a gram of racemic too just to give it a whirl, and really my only interest in ketamine is to try the khole once or twice and then not do it again.&nbsp; Is there any physical damage I can do to myself just by having a bit of a flirt with this chemical or is it safe to blow through a gram and never touch it again, or only rarely touch it?

				While I definitely found ketamine interesting, I never had any otherworldly experiences or euphoria. I felt disoriented, but even at high doses I was functioning fine. Eventually if I snort enough I&#039;ll sort of fall half-asleep. But I don&#039;t have any vivid visions or anything close to that...<br /><br />I have trouble understanding how anyone likes it enough to become addicted though....

				I recently bought the smallest amount I could find (250mg) from SR - I kinda like dissosiatives. 250 mg gave me 3 days of 1-2 hour &quot;highs&quot; each. It was a clean high, no voices talking to me, but quite dream-like. I also have a bit of trouble understanding how some people could like a dissociative too much.
