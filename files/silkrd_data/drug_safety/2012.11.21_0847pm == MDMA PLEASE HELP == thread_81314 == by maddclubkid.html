				Hello everyone I was hoping maybe someone could help me out cause I&#039;m really not sure what happened and any insite would be very helpful. First off a little history. Rolled a few times in late teens but havn&#039;t tried again for 8years or so. 6 months ago was out drinking and was rather drunk actuly and a friend offered me some E so I said what the hell and tried it, took 2 pills and 45min later I was rolling so hard. I couldnt stop dancing I was tearing the dancefloor apart and making out with my girl felt soooooooooooooooooo good and I just loved everyone and evrything. One of the greatest times of my life. So I got interested in the substance and researched more,&nbsp; got a testing kit , meke, simons, marquis. few months later I got some more of the same pills tested good and ate 2 and redose a few hours later with amazing time had simalar results. Few months later got Pure molly via SR tested great change color even faster. 1week prior lsd trip 2 hits, some maryjane here and there throughout the week, also went on an oxy binge monday-friday 30mg a day. Sat preload 1000mg vitamin 1hr before drop, as well as a tums,&nbsp; drop 150mg molly. 1hr later eyes super dialated just dont really feel it, insuflate 50mg, still nothing to much, 30min later eat one of the pills I had from before, kinda rolled but not very good, no love no great sensation from kissing no dance machine =((((( what happened Have I lost my magic? was thinking of trying again with 300mg dose but from what I read people think thats allot, I am a big guy very fast matobolizim. Pre load or opiate mess things up? Bunk product? tests good from one of the #1 sellers. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Opiates reduce psychotic symptoms, due to its effect on the dopamine system. So I think your oxy binge is the problem.<br /><br />I would advice against taking more molly, because if you probably depleted your serotonin levels already. It will do nothing, so taking more will not help. Sorry mate, you have to wait to be able to enjoy again (and no opiates!)<br /><br />A good thread with lots of info on MDMA: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0

The reasoning is simple. MDMA releases then depletes serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme responsible for producing more serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The inhibition is permanent, so the body must compensate by creating more and this restoration typically takes 1-3 months. Taking MDMA prior to this restoration process is altogether stupid. Your body&#039;s reproduction of serotonin is already inhibited and by taking the substance during this healing period will start the entire process over.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				MDMA is a psychedelic drug... It&#039;s effects totally depend on your state of mind.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken MDMA 6 times.<br /><br />I want to talk to you about some of my trips.<br /><br />My first 3 trips were fucking amazing.<br /><br />On my 4&#039;th trip, my girlfriend broke up with me in the middle of my roll, cause she&#039;s against drugs and shit, whatever. While I didn&#039;t get depressed, that shit totally killed my roll, and I had a solid 2-3 hours left. <br />While before, I was dancing like crazy and feeling like the king of the world, after the breakup-talk... I completely sobered up in about 10 seconds and the rest of my roll I was left thinking: &quot;Wtf just happened? Is this MDMA crap? But I&#039;ve taken it before and it worked, why am I not feeling ANYTHING now? It must be my girlfriend! Fuck, I need to find another girl around here. - Then my trip was to find another girl to hookup with - to no avail. The rest of my trip I just felt almost normal, except for the teeth grinding and huge pupils... no euphoria no nothing&quot;<br /><br />After that, I took MDMA again. I was in a normal state of mind, wasn&#039;t upset or anything. And it worked like magic, the feelings came back and I, once again, felt like nothing could stop me.<br /><br />Then, the last time I took MDMA was... guess when... After I broke up with my girlfriend AGAIN. I had 4 hours of wondering why the fuck isn&#039;t the pill working (it was a ferrari/shield, on which I have rolled before and had amazing times).... In the 5th hour I finally realized that I was trying to justify giving her up but I just couldn&#039;t... I loved her &amp; shit. So after I made the decision of getting back together with her, I had 1 hour of euphoria, just like that - SNAP. <br /><br />So a roll, really depends on your state of mind and expectations.<br />You really have to not be sad, and most important, not have worries on your mind. Worries will kill your roll.<br /><br />You have to let go of all your fears, worries and problems and just embrace the beauty of life. That is, if you wanna roll balls.<br /><br />MDMA is not like cocaine, although similar in effects. Cocaine will make you feel like the shit even if you&#039;re super depressed &amp; crap. But MDMA won&#039;t do that, if anything it will amplify whatever feeling you have.... it&#039;s more like LSD in this matter.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Depends on your weight, tiredness that day, how streneous week youve had etc, so many variables. Then theres the quality of the product...I would do 200-220 for the first then if its not enough at least you get a second chance when you do your second. If you do too much on the first you could just blank out and not remember anything.
