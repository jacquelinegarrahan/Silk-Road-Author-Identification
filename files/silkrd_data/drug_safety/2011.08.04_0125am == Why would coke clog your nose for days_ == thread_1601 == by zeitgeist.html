				Whenever I do coke, it clogs my nose for days afterwards.

				Having a stopped up nose the next day after a night of coking if fairly common. Some afrin or decongestants should help. How many days does it usually last?

				Same here.&nbsp; It&#039;s to be expected.&nbsp; Take a 30mg Pseudoephedrine (Advil cold and Sinus, Sudafed) and have some Otrivin handy.&nbsp; Take the 30mg when you are done for the night and use some Otrivin before bed.&nbsp; Blow you nose and do the Otrivin again every time your nose stuffs up.<br /><br />You will probably find you are blowing out junk and some blood (the coke tends to burst some the of capillaries).<br /><br />I find if I follow these steps, and try clearing my nose every couple of hours, by the morning I am fine.<br /><br />One other thing that might help, after you do a line, snort a small amount of water (use a wet tissue, squeeze a couple of drops).&nbsp; I find it helps keep things clear.<br /><br />Just a few suggestions.&nbsp; :)<br />

				I just get a little bit of high quality stuff and I don&#039;t have these nose issues. It&#039;s when I pack a bunch of crap in my face that life starts to suck and I find myself tipping the ol head to one side and pouring hot liquid in my nose. Thinking to myself &quot;Damn I knew better. I should have stayed away from that $50g crap!&quot; Lol. Still sucks days later. Served me right.<br /><br />Stick w/ low quantity,high quality products. You pay more and it&#039;s worth it. You should be fine. No matter how clogged your nose gets, don&#039;t cut your nose off despite your face. Lol. <br /><br />People will pay a lot for a great consistent product, delivered to there door through a safe EASY escrow process.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve recently had the pleasure of testing stuff from GJ and Tetro. One plugged my nose like crazy and one didnt. Definitly depends what its cut with IMO. Make sure to take care of your sinuses regardless.
