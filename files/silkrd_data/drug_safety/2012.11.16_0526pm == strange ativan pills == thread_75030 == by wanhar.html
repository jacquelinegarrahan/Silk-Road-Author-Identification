I order ativan from him and he made me finalize early(I had 0 transactions at the time). After 3 weeks of not getting them he told me wait 2 more weeks then he would refund me. Well, 3 weeks more goes by and he is not answering messages and has not been online in 11 days.<br /><br />I know he has had personal problems from his page and the site going down was bad timing but I am getting zero response from my messages both before and after the outage and they have not even been read.<br /><br />I see several people claiming non-receipt in his feedback.<br /><br />I am confident he sent them because I also ordered valium about a week later from him and got them in short time. The lack of stealth in his packaging makes me think the ativan got seized. I mean I picked up the package and could feel it and say &quot;oh, this obviously has pills in it&quot;. No return address on international package = red flag to customs too. I am amazed the valium made it through.<br /><br />Yes, those are legit ativan they are just the type from India I think so the look different. I wish I got mine lol.

That is very odd indeed.<br /><br />I know the valiums I got from him were top rate.
