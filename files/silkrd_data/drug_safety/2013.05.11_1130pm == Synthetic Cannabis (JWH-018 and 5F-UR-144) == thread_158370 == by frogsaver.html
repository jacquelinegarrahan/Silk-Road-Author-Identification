				Ever since I began smoking I was warned about how spice/k2 etc. were super dangerous, and I&#039;m pretty sure jwh-018 was in the original k2 and has since evolved.Was it other chemicals in &quot;spice&quot; that made it so dangerous, or was the JWH/5FUR144 (I say those two because they are offered on the SR in pre-made smoking alternatives) that was/is harmful? Would buying pure JWH and making my own batch be any safer? I&#039;d like to add that I&#039;ve never seen any proof that these chemicals are dangerous, just a lot of news stories (which I know arent exacty credible) about kids dying/going to the hospital and a lot of word-of-mouth caution about smoking gas station spice. I understand there are general dangers in smoking any chemical, but are they serious enough to be not worth the risk? I would likely be smoking it very often as well. <br />From my internet searches I found a lot of mixed results on this subject so if anyone could offer some clarity that would be great. I&#039;ve read that 5F can be unpleasant and I would like to stick with JWH since its been around longer and therefore has been more tested, but another question that I couldnt fully answer: JWH leaves the system pretty quickly correct? I would likely be given 1-2 weeks notice before any drugs tests, do you think that would be long enough to clean out my system?

				I&#039;ve tried a couple of synthetic cannabinoids including a decent dose of AM-2201, a pretty strong one.<br /><br />I now stay away from them because they just make me trip in a bad way. I&#039;ve given them a good go, tried making the setting perfect but still I end up with open and closed eye visuals and scary ones at that so every time I end up freaking out and just taking a big dose of valium to escape. I also feel pretty groggy the next day. They&#039;re not like smoking the real stuff. I found a lot of forum posts on the clearnet saying similar things, that they wouldn&#039;t go near them again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why they&#039;d be dangerous though. I&#039;ve never heard of that. It sounds like you&#039;ve done your research though. If you&#039;re willing to try it then I&#039;d go for it. Try a small dose at first and see if it interacts with you OK.<br /><br />I&#039;ve no idea about the drug testing stuff.<br /><br />Good luck!
