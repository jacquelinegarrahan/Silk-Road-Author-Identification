				Do any light to moderate smokers have any recommendations for the unpleasant fuzzy head &quot;pain&quot; i get a few days after smoking marijuana? When I used to smoke regularly, I didn&#039;t care about it because it was there all the time, but now that I am only smoking once or twice a month, this side effect is annoying.<br />I am taking plenty vitamin C, but I know there have been other recommendations made here in teh past for post-MDMA, maybe some of them would work post-marijuana<br /><br />Also, if there were strains that had reduced side effects like this, I&#039;d love to know!<br /><br />thanks

				The simple solution is avoiding marijuana entirely. Marijuana tends to induce and bring out weird neurological conditions, that can simply be avoided by abstaining from the substance entirely. I began to get similar &quot;head pain&quot; to a significant degree, in addition to extreme anxiety every time i smoked, and I decided that it just wasn&#039;t worth it any more.<br /><br />Sorry bud, I know it sucks to give up a drug that you once loved, but there&#039;s no magical solution to&nbsp; some of the neurological abnormalities marijuana causes.<br /><br />Just like HPPD, science has not been able to explicitly identify any root cause of these symptoms, and there is no &quot;cure&quot; other than abstinence.

				have you tried drinking lots of water? most people are chronically dehydrated and When you smoke you become even more dehydrated and began to have headaches. That used to happen to me then I started drinking a glass of water with every bowl.

				Interesting, yes I think water is a big part of it. The other symptom I&#039;ve noticed is sinus pain - may be tied with general lowered immune activity which is also a side effect for me (if i smoke regularly I will get a lot of colds)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve abstained for many years, and have no problem doing so again, it is a matter of weighing up pros and cons. I am sure that smoking particular strains, quantities, and in particular mindsets will effect the neurological side-effects differently, so I&#039;m interested in hearing what other people have to say who do smoke intermittently. For example, the head effect is greatly reduced by smoking a small amount of high quality hashish, as opposed to a spliff - tobacco etc causing different effects in the brain/body. <br /><br />I&#039;ve examined my anxiety closely and continue to do so, but am more interested in the pharmacological effects at the moment, aside from spiritual and psychological.<br /><br />

				hmm, im an occasional smoker as well but i&#039;ve never experienced this head pain. I could see how not drinking enough water while high would have a negative effect though. Try drinking more water and maybe eating a little healthier and see if your problem subsides.

It happened to me also very often in the past without noticing it. It&#039;s surprising to me how much water the body seems to need when smoking cannabis.

Have read on several threads how people who smoke regularly in their teens maybe, can start to develop this massive anxiety - i&#039;m sure this is what happened to me in my late teens/early 20s.<br />i hadn&#039;t smoked for many years before SR but i wanted to see if different strains could work for me, and I&#039;m finding my way through gradually, so that the positives outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Right now I have given myself a max dose of 1 pipe/spliff per month, and I&#039;ll see how it goes.<br /><br />I seem to have tackled the anxiety quite well, though heart rate still gets very high with all, especially indicas. Other big problems are lack of articulation (verbal) - which many stoners will be familiar with, and then this side effect of fuzziness in the head. would love to nail this on the head, so i will think more about water generally.<br /><br />Marijuana is a massive massive resource, and I find it a shame that people just use it for fun, because of all the potential benefit it can give if worked with well - water and exercise are examples. Probably time I started to considering vaporising if I am to continue, but I&#039;m happy with the way my experiments are going so far, though there is stress involved still.<br />
