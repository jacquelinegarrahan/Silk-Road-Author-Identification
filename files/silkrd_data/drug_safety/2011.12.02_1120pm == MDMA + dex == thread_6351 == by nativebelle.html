				my MDMA dealer quit last spring so i haven&#039;t done it in a while.&nbsp; a few months ago i was prescribed dex.&nbsp; i plan on making my very first buy here soon but before i do that i want to ask if anyone here has had any experience with this combination?&nbsp; should i stop taking the dex a few days before i roll, or will the dex make it better?&nbsp; is that just a heart-attack waiting to happen?<br /><br />i&#039;ve tried snorting dex before and i haven&#039;t felt ANY sort of effect other than the urge to keep doing things and not being able to sleep.&nbsp; i&#039;ve blown 30mg at once, i feel like that&#039;s more than enough for a good buzz so does that mean i&#039;m just impervious to the euphoric effects?&nbsp; i&#039;m also on lamictal, does that have any sort of negative interaction?

				Yeah I&#039;m also curious about this, the only stim I have easy access to are Dexies, pure MDMA makes me want to chill out in bliss and I usually need to force myself to dance so I wonder if this combo would help give a more energetic buzz.

				I&#039;m assuming you are talking about an amphetamine.&nbsp; If that is the case, it is mostly working through dopamine/epinephrine pathways.&nbsp; Where true MDMA is much more serotonin dominant....until you push it with higher doses.&nbsp; You may miss that small euphoric surge often felt, but I&#039;d say it is still worth it. <br /><br />I have a friend that has taken Adderoll for like 4 years straight for his ADD.&nbsp; Back when we were getting pills (Pretty sure now were methylone or other close substance....much more dopamine) he didn&#039;t feel much of anything, and would fall asleep.&nbsp; Now with the pure stuff coming out of NL,&nbsp; UK, Germ........he is Mr. Love Bud.<br />

				Haven&#039;t had dex for a while but several years ago dex + pure mdma was my weapon of choice. Improved energy and focus with the euphoric part of the m and I would take lower doses than if it was just m by itself.<br />I can&#039;t add anything to caffeine_me&#039;s info on how taking a dex perscription would effect mdma&#039;s potency, I only did it recreationally.

				How much dex/mdma did you take?<br /><br />The MDMA + Amphetamines experiences on erowid don&#039;t make me feel too great about trying this, I&#039;ll just cut out the dex for the week.

				Ah that was when I was more reckless so I don&#039;t know the exact dosages. Usually 1 - 3 pressed pills over the course of a night (200 - 300 mg mdma over 8 hours or so) and a couple 5mg dex. I had a high tolerance though and I&#039;m fairly tall, I wouldn&#039;t recommend nearly that much to start, maybe 80-100mg and one 5mg dex. Start small and if you desire a more intense experience wait a few weeks then up the dose.<br />

				Thanks, will definitely try that in a few weeks.<br /><br />Just tried only .125 of AA&#039;s mdma and I am in love already.

				Glad to hear you enjoyed it, wait some time before dosing again to keep that magic :)<br />Hope you like the dex added in, have fun and be safe!

				Amphetamine will make the roll more neurotoxic, will make the comedown harder and usually has a dulling effect on the true MDMA effects most people are looking for.<br /><br />There is volumes of information about this on Bluelight. Check it out...
