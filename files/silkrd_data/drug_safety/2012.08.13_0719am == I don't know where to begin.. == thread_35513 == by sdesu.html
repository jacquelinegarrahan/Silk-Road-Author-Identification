				So..<br />I start my second year of medical school this Tuesday. I&#039;m usually not the type to get nervous/scared of the first day of school, but for some reason.. I&#039;m really scared. Not because I feel incompetent/ill-prepared/ect; at least, I don&#039;t believe so.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m going on like this, but right I&#039;m now unusually very speedy (and somewhat icky feeling) after smoking DMT. I didn&#039;t break through, I&#039;m sure of it, but I came very close, I think? I don&#039;t remember anything that happened in the last 20ish minutes, but I did somehow manage to vomit twice. I do not have that nasty throat burning, metallic aftertaste like I usually do. I suppose I shouldn&#039;t have eaten Chipotle for dinner. <br /><br />There is no point to this post. I just feel this need to type my ever-fleeting thoughts. Take care.<br /><br />sdesu

				Go down to the drug store and obtain a bottle called Milk of Magnesia. It&#039;s great for stomach ailments/abdominal pain which is mostly psychosomatic (but still real, lol).<br /><br />Anyway, try it out, you won&#039;t regret it.

Fuck me this is why you Americans get yourselves into so much shit! You do something, find out it&#039;s a bad idea and then just carry on anyway, here are some examples - <br /><br />Iraq WMDs - Errrrr there aren&#039;t any WMDs Mr President.....oh we&#039;ll just make some up and invade anyway. <br /><br />Invading Afghanistan - U.K and Russia couldn&#039;t do it.....oh well we will just do it anyway.<br /><br />Vietnam War - Didn&#039;t need to go there......oh well we will do it anyway. <br /><br />Helping the Contras smuggle Blow with the CIA - Oh well we don&#039;t let our citizens take Blow.....but we will smuggle it anyway. <br /><br />Deregulating the banks - Oh well we regulated them after the Great Depression and it enabled 60 years of uninterrupted growth - but we will deregulate them anyway and then cause a global financial crisis. <br /><br />Bill Clinton fucked Monica Cigar Tits - We all knew he did it.....but he lied about it anyway....and then had to admit it anyway....dick&#039;ed anyway. <br /><br />Chipotle - It makes you bleed out your arse - fuck it, we&#039;re American so we will eat it and bleed out our arses anyway. <br /><br />STOP DOING SHIT ANYWAY!
