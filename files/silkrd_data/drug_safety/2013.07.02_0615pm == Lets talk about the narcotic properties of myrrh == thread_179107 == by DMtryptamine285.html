				Investigating the narcotic effects of myrrh<br /><br />myhrr causes analgesia that is reversed by naloxone...<br />&nbsp;<br />The isolate of myrhh mostly responsible for it&#039;s analgesic properties is a furosesquiterpene, called furanoedesma-1,3-diene. It&#039;s supposedly 4X as powerful as morphine on a weight/weight basis with both the hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests.<br />&nbsp;<br />FED also displaces (3H)diprenorphine from central opioid receptors, but with &quot;high inhibition constant&quot;, whatever that means.&lt;&lt;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Myrrh, described in Greek medicine, Plinius and the Gospel, was<br />used as a perfume and as a general remedy. It is a resinous<br />compound from Commphorae myrrha, scrubs typical of the<br />Middle East. It was given to Jesus by the Magi Kings and proposed<br />as a drink (vinum myrratum) before crueifictinn, a potion that he<br />refused. We eharacterlzed ehemieaUy the components of the<br />hexane extract of myrrh by flash chromatography with hexane on<br />silica. The hexane extract had four main sesquiterpenoid<br />components (furanodiene, lindestrene, furanoeudesma-l,3-diene<br />and eurzarene, MWs ranging from 214 to 216). The mixture of<br />these four compounds at a dose of 50 mg/kg, increased leak<br />latency time in the mouse hot plate test (from 15_+0.8 s to 22_+2<br />s, P&lt;0.05) and decreased the number of stretehings in the mouse<br />writhing test from 43+4 to 26_+2, I,_+ SE, P&lt;0,05. These responses<br />were blocked by 1 mg/kg of naloxone and by the 8 specific<br />antagonist naltrindole (1 mg/Kg), which did not block the effect of<br />5 mg/kg morphine p.o. We studied the structure of curzarene and<br />furanoeudesma with computer molecular modelling, comparing<br />hem with the ~ opiod specific agonist D-Pen2D-Pen 5 (DPDPE)<br />and we found a good overlapping of the three steric structures. We<br />also characterized the binding of the sesquiterpenes of myrrh to<br />CNS opiod receptors with 3H-diprenorphine. Furanoeudesma was<br />able to displace the specific binding of diprenorphine to opioid<br />receptors. Myrrh contains agonists of/t oplod receptors, effective<br />orally, which explain its popularity in the folk medicine in the past.&quot;<br /><br />Notes from my experience with myrrh essential oil<br /><br />Consumed eight drops diluted with water so as not to irritate the lining of my stomach. 10:00 am<br /><br />Feeling rather stimulated now, typing faster than normal, mind clear but dreamlike...still feel a bit removed, nausea is settling down. 11:00am<br /><br />Pupils constricted, not quite pinpoint but smaller than normal, wasnt really expecting opiate like effects from the essential oil as the aromatic compounds are more indicative of a sedative effect, I didnt think the opiate compounds where present in the oil. Perhaps I was wrong. 11:19 am<br /><br />Opiate like effects fading, stimulant effects diminishing 12:30 pm<br /><br />baseline 1:00<br /><br /><br />
