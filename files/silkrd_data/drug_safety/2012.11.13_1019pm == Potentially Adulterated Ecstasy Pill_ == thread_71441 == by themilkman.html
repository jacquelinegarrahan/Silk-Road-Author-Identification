				I recently bought a pill of ecstasy off a friend the other day. Given this is my first time dabbling in this drug I thought I best play it safe and read up about it as much as possible, including the pill I was given. I checked out PillReports and the pill matches one record which is currently flagged as a warning pill.<br /><br />http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=30624<br /><br />I looked into it deeper and it seems the pill *may* contain a chemical called 5-IT. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s entirely composed of this chemical of if it&#039;s an MDMA/5-IT mix, for instance. So I&#039;ve ordered a marquis test to see if there&#039;s any MDMA content in the pill. If the pill tested positive for MDMA then I was going to take either half or full and see how that goes.<br /><br />My friend took 2 and a half of these pills and he&#039;s still alive and kicking, so that&#039;s why I think I&#039;ll be okay if I take one. He seemed to have a good time as well. But it&#039;s not at all reassuring reading the report and seeing that it&#039;s potentially killed several people due this shitty stupid fucking 5-IT research chemical. This is why drugs should be regulated because people are just cutting it with anything these days to save a bit of buck.<br /><br />Anyway, if this pill tests positive on the marquis test should I just down it? Or am I a fucking idiot for even asking this?<br /><br />Cheers.

				I would be careful, in PillReports it states they are from Glasgow and I think it may have something to do with (clearnet) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20282983

				Yeah I&#039;ve seen that story. Glasgow is where I got them as well. Apparently it&#039;s the chemical 5-IT that is causing these adverse reactions. The stories don&#039;t say how much was consumed though, they could have been taking several pills in conjunction with alcohol. I&#039;ve read about the Internet and people are buying 5-IT itself to use since it&#039;s legal in the UK, but it&#039;s supposedly a pretty shitty RC anyway so the reports of the chemical itself aren&#039;t too exciting. It was reported that you shouldn&#039;t really go above 100mg of 5-IT unless you know what you&#039;re doing. Unfortunately I have no idea how much of it is in a pill. I was hoping that they would be predominantly MDMA and maybe some 5-IT present. I&#039;m gutted because I really wanted to try it out but there&#039;s no point if it&#039;s a shitty, potentially lethal pill.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t got an account on TSR yet so even when it does come back up I&#039;m still left with shitty MDMA availability haha!

				If you really want to ingest the drug, then atleast do the marquis test you mentioned. It isn&#039;t even sure if the pill contains MDMA, most likely MDA/A.<br /><br />And a more down-to-earth tip, I would say wait for a real, good pill to lose your ecstacy-virginity to, it is important that you get to know what ecstacy really is like, rather than get a seizure of an non-searched chemical.<br /><br />Be very careful when it comes to RCs, they can be potentially dangerous.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice.<br /><br />Thinking about it, that&#039;s probably my best bet. In the end, it&#039;s MDMA I want to try not 5-IT or any other research chemical. Not a huge monetary loss, just a bit pissed off my friend would sell me shit that could kill me. I will wait until I can register to TSR and try my luck with the quality stuff that&#039;s available here.<br /><br />It bloody sucks not knowing anyone with quality goods.<br /><br />Cheers.<br />

I couldn&#039;t agree more, whenever your trying a drug for the first time, you should always purchase the best (purist) possible, that way you&#039;ll have a benchmark set for what makes the drug right. Best of luck with your MDMA mission on SilkRoad, hope your first time is a beautiful experience you&#039;ll always remember&nbsp; :)

				My suggestion is to check the &quot;rumor mill&quot; section for the MDMA reviews. Many SR users test their booty well and share the info on where they got it. I would stick with the tan &quot;molly&quot;. 1G of good MDMA is about 10 strong doses or more light ones depending on your body weight. 60mg is a good starting point for me. I personally bought a set of mg scales to regulate my dosage by my body weight.&nbsp; I also like 2cb which is very dose specific and complementary to MDMA when I am on the down-slope of my roll. I insulfate 11mg and it hurts for a minute in the sinuses but it really does wonders for my head.<br /><br />Send the pill to be tested and get something that has been reviewed here if the site returns to normal. It is not worth your beautiful life to take poison pills. Fucking prohibition is killing people by creating bastards who sell poison shit for money with no regard to quality or life itself. THIS is why I LOVE SR!! It is the good people here who actually help each other stay safe. You all know who you are and I love you.

If they have been consuming alcohol and are out and about, the effects can be highly subjective and it is very hard, especially for a beginner, to identify the possible active ingredients in the pill. I have been horrified to find out friends who have consumed street pills that they didn&#039;t bother to PR and it turns out they were DXM/PMA etc. Yes they were alive and kicking the next day, but it is very careless to consume untested pills, especially with&nbsp; a warning on PR. Follow the above advice given, get some BC&#039;s together and order some amazing molly that is for the best part of it, adulterant free! I&#039;m from Aus and I simply do not consume anything that is non-SR sourced. I&#039;d rather go out and stick to grog than gamble with my brain and liver on locally produced product.<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />Capz&nbsp; 8)

				Yeah, I&#039;d like to see the results of a test on that posted too. Shit like that is what rteally gave MDMA a bad rep to begin with. So far doing research here I have had great quality every time.
