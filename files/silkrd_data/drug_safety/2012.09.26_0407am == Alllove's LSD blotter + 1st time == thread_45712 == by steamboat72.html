				I&#039;m thinking about buying Alllove&#039;s 200ug blotter sample. I&#039;ve been scouring the forums for LSD topics and I really appreciate all the advice floating around out there. I think I can make a more informed choice about taking it. I&#039;m also glad that the exaggerations on it have been cast away.&nbsp; It says it&#039;s around 200 ug but of course no one can really know. My question is, is that going to be too much for a first time user?&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on going to a rave or putting myself in a bad situation. In fact, for the first time I plan on staying at home, moving my speakers to my living room and listening to a whole bunch of good music.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are some personal notes:<br /><br />Mentally, I am a bit stressed and anxious about graduating, school, and getting a job.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve taken half an eighth of shrooms before. It was an interesting experience, it had an enlightening effect and was very introspective but it also does take out some of the insecurities I had about myself. I was really self conscious about not having a lot of friends (it was my first year at school and this fact still remains) and I felt like I was sub par for that.&nbsp; It had its ups and downs. I felt really positive about who I was but again I had a pretty bad time too. So in all it was 40/60 good to bad.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to give as much info as possible so I can get informed opinion to take it or not and if this dose is good or not.&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on freaking out or anything. I&#039;ve smoked lots of weed and the paranoia/anxiety seems to happen to me but a lot of it had to do with fear of getting caught (was in a dorm or in a place where it could be smelled) so I definitely see how environment has a lot to do with it.&nbsp; Also I know how mental issues can affect you. From what I&#039;ve read, LSD can help you transcend some things and teach you that life is only the present and your perception of the present is what controls the present. It&#039;s something I read in a prior thread and it made sense to me.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope this is somewhat clear. I can elaborate more or clarify if need be. But would like to have the opinion of the board. I was surprised upon reading old threads that people here aren&#039;t all about &quot;pushing dope&quot; on people and actually see this as a community to guide people and make all experiences worthwhile.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend 200ug for a first timer, although I did bring one friend on a journey through nature for their first trip which was 200ug.&nbsp; He needed it.&nbsp; Guy was in a darker place in his life.&nbsp; Immediately saw the beauty and was talking about how he wanted to share with people but no one will listen.... classic acid-head talk.<br /><br />Alllove&#039;s tabs may not have 200ug though.&nbsp; The LSD Avengers have very little information on their tabs, and the rest of the forums seem to have less.&nbsp; I hope they are though!&nbsp; I have bought from Alllove before and loved the hash they had.&nbsp; They even rolled that shit in keiff.&nbsp; It was yummy as hell.<br /><br />Ok so I&#039;ll shut up and tell you what I&#039;d recommend.&nbsp; Be safe about your set and setting (as I&#039;m sure you probably already understand), wait for a reputable LSD vendor to come around who&#039;s dosages are confirmed by others on the forums, buy their tabs and try to only eat 100ug.&nbsp; Cut the tab up if you get a stronger one somewhere.<br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; LSD can share an absolutely stunning, beautiful, and important way of thinking.&nbsp; Be safe and understand that you shouldnt expect yourself to go do normal people stuff while you are on it.&nbsp; I think the biggest stress is being somewhere/with someone that does not want you to be that way.&nbsp; I hope this helps<br /><br />---<br /><br />The Spegrodomous

				Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; Unfortunately in the market I only see the Alllove blotter. I&#039;d like just to try one tab then if I like it buy several more.&nbsp; So you think more people will end up entering SR to sell LSD?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read only one review of the acid so far. Seemed pretty good but again, very little information present.&nbsp; So I guess the consensus is that 200 ug is too much for a first timer?

				I couldn&#039;t honestly recommend to you that you try 200ug, but there are worse things.<br /><br />I would recommend looking at The Avengers LSD Thread in the Rumor Mill and picking some of the vendors that they approve.&nbsp; Most of the good vendors&#039; stock just comes and goes so it is a bit of a waiting game.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you if you wanna go with Alllove.&nbsp; They seem to be very professional and kind so I doubt you&#039;ll have any troubles. <br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />---

				My advise -<br />1.&nbsp; knowing what to expect.&nbsp; Check out erowid.org all your information you could possibly want<br />2.&nbsp; start small 1/2 the dose or some thing so you know the feel of the uptake and the plateau, then after 3 hours you can take the other 1/2 or so.&nbsp; Feeling like your being shot out of cannon and wondering how high you will go is not fun and you don&#039;t want to have your whole trip being consumed by that one thought.<br />3.&nbsp; Very important - pick the right time, the right place with the right people.&nbsp; comfortable surrounding, no distractions, no work the next day and choose someone that has a good sense of humor and is a little bit of a deep thinker.&nbsp; you will be laughing so hard and discussing such new insights.&nbsp; This is the trip you want, especially the first time.&nbsp; You won&#039;t regret it.<br />4.&nbsp; As with many things you want to push the envelope but still remain in control.&nbsp; Loss of control is not what you want for the first time.&nbsp; Save the psychonaught trip for another day..&nbsp;

				even if you take 200 ug youd most likely be fine.&nbsp; the tabs probably dont have as much as they say... its notorious for people to represent them as more than they actually are, just take a tab and enjoy the ride<br /><br />the first lsd trip ever was about 250 ug, and he didnt know what was happening, whether he would ever stop tripping, or even if he was about to die <br /><br />just remember its one of the safest (least toxic for active dose) drugs you could ever use

				Wondering if doing it around family would be a bad idea. Should be 100 to 125ug strength and plan on doing it at home with family around. If taken by six and the rest go to bed around 10/11 or so, can a person remain functional, normal, etc since it&#039;s a low dose?&nbsp; At what time would sleep be possible also?

				200ug is the ideal amount for a first trip -- but only if you have an experienced sitter. If you don&#039;t have a sitter, you should start with 100ug and make sure you are in a peaceful and safe environment surrounded with good vibes.

				But with ~125ug, will I be able to do it at home? I don&#039;t wanna take it at 10pm when everyone is asleep. I&#039;d rather start at five or six that way around 2 am or so I can go to sleep. I just don&#039;t wanna risk looking drugged out for the first few hours or anything. Will this be possible?

				LSD is fun alone or with other people. I have a great time dropping a few hits around 10PM at night and then watching music videos on FUZE tv all night. If you are with some of your friends then you can watch a good movie or TV show and thats alot of fun.
