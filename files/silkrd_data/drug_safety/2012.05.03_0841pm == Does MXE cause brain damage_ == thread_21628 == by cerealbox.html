				What kind of damage does MXE do to the brain? I know it&#039;s supposedly bladder-safe, but what about the brain? What kind of damage am i likely doing to that squishy gray sponge I call a home?

				MXE being bladder-safe is just an educated guess. They think it&#039;s due to the lower amounts of material needed for effect. Smaller amounts = less metabolites remaining in system.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as bad for you mentally or physically as K is, but it&#039;s also much weaker than K. Just know that NO ONE has a concrete answer for this.

Do you mean in terms of damage because I had thought it was a stronger, shorting acting, more psychedelic drug than K.&nbsp; But that may have to do with method of administration.<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methoxetamine/methoxetamine_dose.shtml<br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml<br /><br />Also if you haven&#039;t seen it; this is an interested Ketamine/MXE related article... <br />http://www.vice.com/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2

				IMO Psychosis may always be a problem with chemicals like this. Stick to K when possible. A lot cleaner and happier high! :)

				I suppose you&#039;ll be more at risk for Alzheimer&#039;s or Schizophrenia, surely something related to that. At least if you do as much in a week as me. :P I have no actual clue but I don&#039;t intend to live long enough to find out anyways.....so hip hip hooray for drugs! Yay! ;D

				imo ketamine is safer considering its highly researched and the research points to it being safe, and MXE is not researched at all.

				I&#039;m not sure it&#039;d ever be possible to tell as everyone will have unique environmental and genetic conditions (i.e. if all your siblings are diagnosed schizophrenic, your mum was hospitalized for psychosis, and you live next to someone that plays &lt;insert least favorite music here&gt; all day long, don&#039;t take it :) ).<br /><br />That said, many, many people end up with Alzheimer&#039;s, Schizophrenic, or anything and they may have never taken a drug in their life...

				In 20 years we&#039;ll have a much more accurate picture of the effects of RCs.<br />I was only crawling so my first hand experience is lacking, but surely during the 70&#039;s the same question was asked of Molly and Nexus?

Wasn&#039;t even sure if I would come back, in fact I was afraid I wouldn&#039;t. Luckily god appeared and guided me home safely. :P<br /><br />If it were to happen permanently it&#039;d probably be in the % that are already inclined to such illness.<br /><br />But yes, MXE commands respect! It is a very powerful chemical! Don&#039;t push it! Stay safe!
