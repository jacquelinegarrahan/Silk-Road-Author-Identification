				Like the subject says. I have experience with other psychedelics(shrooms, LSD, DMT) and am looking forward to trying this. I&#039;ve looked up the basic effects and dosages of the drug, but other information has been hard to find. So, any tips, advice, etc a newbie should know going in?

				I haven&#039;t done it so much as failed to do it properly by not taking enough. I was eye-balling it (which is stupid) and was afraid of taking too much. Make sure you have a good scale. Of course you should watch out not to take too much, from what I remember reading about it, it can be just a few mg&#039;s off and be too much. This is newbie advice to a newbie though, so I hope someone else chimes in with better advice.

				If you&#039;re taking any MAOI&#039;s do not take this. If you have a history of mental illness in your family, do not take it either.<br /><br />Because of the potency of this drug, make sure you have a very nice scale that measures milligrams out with little error. Because it&#039;s your first time I would start off with 10mg for smoking it. <br /><br />The smoke is harsh, like that of DMT. For this particular version I prefer to use a standard meth pipe. I usually choose to smoke 5-MeO as it provides me with the quickest duration, and with minimal after effects (generally lasting about 20 minutes). <br /><br />If you choose to snort it, be prepared for a nasty nasal drip, as well as after effects lasting for easily over an hour, and a total duration lasting a little over an hour as well. Smoking gives you a duration of 20 minutes or so. <br /><br />You can also take 5-MeO orally, but I&#039;ve never done that and have no knowledge on duration or hangover.<br /><br />For any method though, start out with 10mg as this is a light dose. If you want to just try a threshold dose, start off with 5mg.<br /><br />Make sure you have a friend nearby to take the pipe from you if you&#039;re smoking it, and preferably they will leave the room after you start your trip. 5-MeO is a solitary drug, and external stimuli (talking, movement) will take you out of the trip. Also, water is a good thing to have no matter which way you take it. I always find myself thirsty after a trip on 5-MeO.
