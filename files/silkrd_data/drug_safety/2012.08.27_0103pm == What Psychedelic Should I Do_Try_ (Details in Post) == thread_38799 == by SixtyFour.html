				So there&#039;s lots of new stuff on the market since I last tripped.<br /><br />I&#039;d like something that doesn&#039;t last too long--three to four hours would be perfect. Back &quot;in the day&quot; I&#039;ve done acid (got my hands on a vial of 100 liquid drops once, that was an interesting summer), shrooms, and something sold as &quot;chocolate&quot; mescaline (it was fantastic, such an easy comedown and happy trip). Definitely don&#039;t want anything that lasts as long as acid or shrooms. I would consider mescaline again if what I had was indeed mescaline (brown powder, tasted like chocolate but I assume that was some kind of cut). I&#039;m open to some of the new RC&#039;s.<br /><br />I have an old friend coming into town next month. I&#039;d like to trip while we take a little nature hike. The hike isn&#039;t too vigorous, just a couple hours and the weather won&#039;t be too hot. Friend and I are in good shape so the hike won&#039;t be strenuous for us.<br /><br />Any suggestions? I need to be able to dose after breakfast, hike/trip, then be fit by&nbsp; to rejoin squares who can&#039;t know what&#039;s up by dinner time.

				Try insufflated NBOME :) I&#039;d recommended 25c for nature. It lasts about 4-6 hours and is great outside.

				I&#039;d do shrooms because it comes from nature so what a better drug to explore the surrounding nature with something that came from it? low-dose shrooms should last 4-6 hours.

				Mr SixtyFour, <br /><br />Is that how old you are? Or the favorite year of your LSD fueled childhood? Or just your favorite Beatles song?<br /><br />I recommend 2C-B at a low dose. (15-20mg) or more if you are a larger person. If you take too much it will be hard to control / interact but at those lower levels it&#039;s like a completely different drug. Very gentle visuals, almost no anxiety, a lovely body feeling and &quot;rushiness&quot;.<br /><br />Shulgin actually calls it his favorite and I can see why. Mind you, if you do go overboard with the dose it&#039;s very forgiving too. Just sit down and enjoy the ride. <br /><br />Metabolizes quite quickly, and won&#039;t take you out of action for too long. <br /><br />Hope this helps. <br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t go with 25i, because as I recently found out, it can be really intense. Intense joy turning to intense terror, I guess just like acid and mushrooms can be. 2cb is so colourfully visual in high doses, with nothing more than a nice warm stoney body feeling, and not a worry in the world.&nbsp; 25i is GREAT mind you, and you have had your fair share of psych experience by the sounds of things...so maybe you wanna go 25i.<br />Just be careful with 25i, 2mg sublingual was too strong for me. <br /><br />So, for more intense emotions and thinking with great manifesting visuals 25i around 1mg to 1.5gm<br />or<br />2cb 30mg<br />2cb has duration going for it too, only last about 5 hours total, and you wont be worried and paranoid about the squares knowing that you took drugs during the day, whereas with 25i you&#039;re might possibly be inclined to worry about little things like that more, and have a bad time.

				100% without a doubt get some 2C-B it give&#039;s you energy and will be perfect for a hike! Nature will look absolutely BEAUTIFUL it&#039;s such a colorful substance and it put&#039;s you in a very happy state of mind, there&#039;s no mindfuck to it and for the most part is pretty gentle on the body. It also has a great body high I personally would put it right behind MDMA some may disagree but you&#039;ll see for yourself it come&#039;s in waves and is very pleasant. I would recommend you take 20-25mg orally and it should last a good 4-5 hours peaking around hour 2 or so. But anyway I hope you take my advice you won&#039;t regret taking this wonderful substance!!! :D <br /><br />For 2C-B this is who I would recommend you buy from since you&#039;ve never tried it before and probably want a small amount.<br /><br />1) 5x Premium 2C-B Tablet&#039;s (This vendor is very reliable and his quality is always good even though he&#039;s new to selling these trust me they will be good I promise. Plus if you do not have a scale these will be super helpful.)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/81b2a2d99b<br /><br /><br />2) 2C-B 100mg 99% Pure (He&#039;s a new vendor but the review&#039;s look great I would highly suggest you try this vendor if you have a milligram scale.)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/49610d0756<br /><br /><br />3) 2C-B 25mg Capsule (Vendor is well known and if your looking for just 1 dose this is the guy to get it from, the review&#039;s on the quality look&#039;s good and so does the shipping time)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/35aba5fa52

				For short duration, 2CB isn&#039;t a bad option.&nbsp; I&#039;m just coming down now&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Tooting it though stings like a bitch and the come-up is pretty rapid and intense, but it&#039;s fun and colourful and the comedown is actually very pleasant - I&#039;m always in a very happy place afterwards.<br /><br />Even better is a small amount of Molly (I like 100mg oral) and then 2-3hrs in toot 10-15mg of Bees and LET THE FUN BEGIN&nbsp; :)
