				Hi, first let me say what a beautiful idea Silk Road is, and as soon as I&#039;m finished studying and feel comfortable with bitcoins and encryption I will start placing my orders:) I am curious as to what pharmaceutical opiates are smokeable. Specifically I mean they will track on foil, not a bowl topper.<br /><br />I know about OC(oxycontin), and oxycodone/roxi 30s. But I can get 30s cheaper here then on SR, and being a noob I don&#039;t feel comfortable going international for OC. I have heard some 8mg dilaudid/hydromorphone will smoke but with mixed reviews on results. I have also heard 30mg ER morphine do quite well as long as you scrape off the coating like with OC. And I do enjoy smattering the occasional blunt with some codeine syrup. Any feedback(besides on OC or oxy/roxi 30s) is appreciated. And I&#039;m not interested in how much better IV/IM is, I&#039;m a dabbler and would rather not deal with the risks associated with IV.

				Most pharmaceutical opiates are a waste smoking. I know some will argue that fact, but your just wasting a ton. With oxycodone, orally you are getting in the 90 percentile and iv its is100 pecent. if you smoke it, its less than 50 percent.. nasally it isn&#039;t much better.<br /><br />The only opiates that I have heard are worth smoking is fentanyl and H.. Other than that, its a waste. Unless there is an opiate that works well smoking and i havent heard much about it. I dont know about morphine, but i think the heat kills it before it vaporizes or it comes close.... <br /><br />Just say no to smoking pills...

				Thank you for the reply, I don&#039;t think most conversion charts have data for smoking so it seemed like a guessing game to me. I wonder if for some reason the old OC oxycontin percentage was higher then the 30s. OC&nbsp; used to smoke really well if you scraped the coating off of it, don&#039;t know why they were so much better then the IR oxy/roxi 30s since they are both forms of oxycodone the contin just ER. <br /><br />So I guess new question what pharmaceutical opiates can/are easiest to IV? can you just stick a 4mg dilaudid with water and cook it up or is there a process (like scraping off coating) to it. If I were to IV I wouldn&#039;t want there to have to be a whole process with the pill I would be neurotic enough about sterilizing equipment already...<br /><br />
