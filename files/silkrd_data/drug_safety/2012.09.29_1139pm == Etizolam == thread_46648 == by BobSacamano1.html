				Just picked up a few of these rare treats. They are unprinted so I know they&#039;re from some other country (I&#039;m from the U.S., we print our Pharm pills, for good fuckin reason hah) but due to word of mouth and a photo match online I took em, and they are great. Very much like xanax, short half-life I believe, also not technically not a benzodiazepine but a thoreinediazepine or something like that.&nbsp; Seems like significantly more energy and slightly more euphoria than traditional benzo. Just wanted to see if anyone on here had any further info/experience, being that this is an international forum and these are definitely not marketed in the U.S., not yet at least. Speak yo mind!

				I&#039;m not a big fan of them, but they will work fine as sleep aids. While not technically a benzo, i&#039;d say the are rather comparable to something like ambien. Fine if you have difficulty falling asleep, but little recreational value.

				So if it were prescribed by a doctor, I wouldn&#039;t go through withdrawal, but since I have settled on a daily dose that works for me I will. I had previously been prescribed higher doses of more powerful medicine BY doctors, and they never worked, so they fiddled with the dose almost weekly (and billed me for their mistakes by the way) so I found a medication that works for me, and worked out a dose that works for me. I am not telling the OP that he should take 4mg every day just for the hell of it, but I have been fighting this battle for a long time, so don&#039;t bother trying to tell me what is right for me or try to scare me with words like &quot;withdrawal&quot; I wouldn&#039;t advise you against any medicine that helped you function in your day to day life, so don&#039;t try to be my &quot;doctor&quot; because I am not going to pay you for your consult!

				maybe 20 years ago I would have come back with some sob story if drugs had ruined my life, but at my age, drugs have enhanced my life, and etizolam is the first thing to take the edge off of my anxiety. And etiz is what we are talking about in this thread, so I posted my etiz regiment. if you want to have a discussion about regular psychedelic use in the long term, I have a few things to say there, but each person has their own path to travel. I have chosen mine, and I will let you choose yours.

				My point was mostly that doctors have the power of perscription, so if you actually find one who is trustworthy and has integrity, they can put you an a very precise and gradual taper schedule to avoid WD. Because you are gonna need that, big time. I get the sense you probably already know this, but having someone else who knows you and whom you trust regulate your addictive medication is just better. You should be scared of benzo WD at the pace you are going at. Its not fear mongering, its reality.

				I&#039;m personally done with benzo-like drugs, not that I ever did them too much. I used to suffer from anxiety which was fixed by a really strong acid/nbome trip. I used to take .5mg of alprazolam when I had anxiety, and the occasional recreational use of 2mg. <br /><br />3mg of Etizolam + weed is really euphoric. That&#039;s the only time I took it, and I was left hungry for more. Nowdays it would be nice to only take them on the comedown of a psychedelic, or the end of a roll (I also don&#039;t roll anymore). I can live without them though.<br /><br />Etizolam also has strange anti-depressant properties for some people, so it might be a better route than taking Xanax, which made me more depressed when it was wearing off.<br /><br />If there was a vendor selling these somewhat cheap I&#039;d pick up a few, but there really isn&#039;t.<br /><br />Personally, I say fuck daily use of benzos to treat anxiety. Anxiety is your body&#039;s way of reacting to reality. Deal with reality and the anxiety will go away. When it&#039;s really bad, it can help, but it gets to a point where benzos become an escape. I urge to try meditating which is a bit more work than taking a pill. Trust me, I feel way better, more focused, more energy, more of all the good stuff.

				^Right, I know, so Diazepam or Clonazepam then, some mid-long half life benzo to taper obviously it dont need to be etiz, but etiz is a benzo honestly I dont care abut the specific pahramacology I took it today that shit is a benzo, and wiki says benzo withdrawal syndrome is exactly the same with it. So yeah, klonopin or valium, a very gradual taper taking a month or two could avoid most serious WD...

				not to be combative, I know you are trying to help, but the fact is that the &quot;pace&quot; I am on is steady. I am no stranger to withdrawal, which is why I remain clean of opiates, and speed.

				Yeah man, best of luck not tryin to hate on something that is really working for you. I would just say, psychedillic withdrawal? That is not a thing. Speed withdrawal? That is a very rare thing and AINT SHIT compared to benzo withdrawal. I&#039;ve been prescribed dexamphetamine daily for like 5 years, aint no WD about it. I go off it when I feel like going off it and feel perfectly fine. Like seriously 100% the days after cessation, I just might eat a bit more and take a nap or two. I was using xanax for a couple months, self-medicating much like you, and visited hell for a solid week when I ran out. Just don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you, when you do plan to taper do it under medical supervision, that&#039;s all.

At least you can function while medicating. I personally, without going into detail, dropped out of everything. It was probably a good and bad thing at the same time, but the benzos made not give a fuck. It really is different for everyone.
