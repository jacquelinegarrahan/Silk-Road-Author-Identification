				I&#039;ve had pretty bad depression problems and symptoms, which at a large portion of this year kept me from doing much to finish my PhD. I just could not do anything but sleep.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am considering Modafinil as I&#039;ve heard it promotes wakefulness and nootropic activity without the artificial speed and body load of caffeine and amphetamines.<br /><br />Amphetamines seem to just make me feel so racy that actual comprehension is moot.<br /><br />Any experience? Thank you.

				I&#039;ve been diagnosed with major depression. I&#039;ve been on all the major SSRI&#039;s.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m off. One issue I&#039;ve been dealing with is perpetual tiredness so I started using Armodafinil during the day and sleeping with Melatonin at night. <br /><br />Yes, it works better than SSRI&#039;s but be careful of what you are also taking -avoid large doses of caffeine for instance or if you are going to really party (coke)-skip your dose of modafinil that day.<br />

				If you&#039;re looking to save some cash and not face potential legal repercussions, Adrafinil metabolizes into Modafinil and is unscheduled/legal for purchase without a prescription.
