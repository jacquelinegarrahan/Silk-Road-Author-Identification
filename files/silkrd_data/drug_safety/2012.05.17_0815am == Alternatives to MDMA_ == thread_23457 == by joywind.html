				What are some good alternatives to MDMA? I want something that produces a similar empathetic and euphoric experience, but hopefully without the potential neurotoxic effects.<br /><br />Are Methylone and 2C-B comparable to MDMA? How does MDA compare?

				I asked this exact question under &quot;Rave supplements&quot; title a few days ago with no real response other than acid, 2c-b, methylone.<br /><br />I think the neurotoxicity/side effects are a result of the desired effects and no drug is going to be able to replace that, without causing similar damage. That said, I have not read much about methylones neurotoxicity, perhaps because it is less popular. It is meant to be stimulating like a larger dose of MDMA can be which is what I&#039;m looking for really.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to do speed to be honest, seems like purity is low and being a robot doesn&#039;t appeal to me. <br /><br />2c-b/acid sounds alright for a rave/party but on psychedelics I never really want to dance or talk to others. <br /><br />There&#039;s always alcohol for raves! That plus caffeine is good!

				Drugs effect people differently, so you might end up with a few conflicting reports!<br />IMO the closest thing I&#039;ve used to molly is M-one, but I&#039;ve got a mate who finds it too much, he can&#039;t control his buzz as well as he can with MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend getting and trying them ALL!!! Worked for me!!!

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d1e6e6c7a3<br /><br />try those. Not sure about the neurotoxic properties though.<br /><br />MDA as well, but I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s potential more neurotoxic.<br /><br />Just pre and post load your rolls and space them out, youll be fine.<br /><br />Life is about gives and takes, you can&#039;t have a drug that has no side effects or is 100% safe to do all the time.

				I had a great time doing 2-CB, did 30mg orally. Got a little cold and felt a bit of nausea at first start up but then it went away quickly. Had some decent visuals and listening to music was great so it&#039;s definitely something I would like to use during a rave. Although the next morning I had a killer headache, not sure if it was from the drug or just the lack of water.

				Nah, not really at the dose I took anyway, was chatting with my girlfriend on skype just fine. Although I got side tracked at times because I was just playing around with my hand by waving it in front of me lol, did that effect where I saw the traces of my hand when I moved it if you know what I mean, was pretty cool.

				If you&#039;re willing too you could try some RC&#039;s such as B2 or Mephedrone. These produce the euphoric feeling which some find more intense and pleasurable then mdma, and a simular loved up feeling, but this isn&#039;t as good as the mdma love.. <br />BUT they don&#039;t last as long 100mins max (sorted), both produce craving when the effects wear off and remember, they are RC&#039;s!<br />&nbsp;

				i would suggest ketamine. in small doses, used infrequently it is pretty safe. it provides a sense of nice euphoria and gives a mild stimulant effect at low doses. i find it perfect for a rave setting. but thats just me. if your interested do some research&nbsp; :)

				2c-c in higher doses have been known to have a similar euphoria to MDMA though it&#039;s more mellow than stimulating. 2c-i is a bit more stimulating though the euphoria is different, more giddy than joy. <br /><br />I read that 25c-NBOMe gives a MDx-like euphoria with very little body load (haven&#039;t had a chance to try that one yet tyough). <br /><br />25i-NBOMe is more readily available and lasts longer but it has a bigger body load (there is some MDx-like euphoria but it&#039;s pretty light).
