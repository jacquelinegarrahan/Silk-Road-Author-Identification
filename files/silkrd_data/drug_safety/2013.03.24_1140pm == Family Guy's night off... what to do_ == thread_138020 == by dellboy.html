				So every month or two I have a night off. I have a stash of weed, MDMA, and Jack Daniels. They mix well together for me, but I fancy something new.<br /><br />I considered throwing a little speed into the mix, but maybe I&#039;m behind the times? Any suggestions? I have a few things I want out of this...<br /><br />- Must be able to pass an unexpected night-time phonecall. Perfectly okay for me to one-liner a &quot;fell asleep on the sofa, just woke up, going to bed, phone me in the morning&quot; or not answer for 30mins beforehand.<br />- Can&#039;t be too trippy. I don&#039;t want an 8-hr LSD tripathon with the neighbors seeing me in the garden staring at the hedge.<br />- Can&#039;t be really addictive as I have that sort of personality. Coke&#039;s out.<br />- Would prefer that it goes okay with alcohol (I figure GHB&#039;s out).<br /><br />Maybe I should just stick to my my weed/e/booze stash? Would be interested in hearing what other older guys do to kick back.

				Ever thought about Ketamine? Maybe DMT? I think those are great drugs for just taking a night off and getting high alone.

				If you haven&#039;t added it to the stash yet I would put the MDA into the mix. I love MDMA when I am with someone for all that loved up telepathic goodness but MDA is better as a loner drug since it just makes you feel physically amazing. Personally I don&#039;t mix X with drinking but lots of people do so you should be fine if done in moderation. Also, a light LSD or even candy flip is possible. 100ug of LSD will not make most people trip too hard but it adds a nice sense of wonderment to the evening, even if it does last longer than you normally want.

				2CB actually isn&#039;t a bad idea. It&#039;s not too hard to dose, I was extremely worried about it when I first started but bought a bunch of it and sort of figured the stuff out. I put together a little faq over at http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.0 if you want some ideas.<br /><br />I think I skip 2CB sometimes just because it&#039;s not very trippy but in your case that would probably work out for the best. It&#039;s a fully functioning psychedelic at sub 20mg doses but I&#039;d start off in the 5-15mg range and work from there. You&#039;d want to snort it for a few hours of adventure. It sets it MUCH faster that way - minutes vs. hours - and only lasts a few hours. It&#039;s not like Acid where it messes with your head much - just gives a nice body high and some visuals if you take enough - but doesn&#039;t create a sense of wonder and beauty that will leave you communing with god. <br /><br />The key to MDA is to just wait until ILF gets back from vacation (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5be5f2e73a) and order from them. I&#039;ve never heard anything bad about there stuff and have gone through multiple batches of it with each being great.<br /><br />Anyway, have fun!

				Get yourself some s-isomer ketamine.<br />Very very chill and very easy to titrate doses.<br />You can do a little bit and feel relaxed, or you can do more and have a mind trip that lasts about 30 min - 2 hours depending how much you do. I wouldn&#039;t recommend combining ketamine and alcohol though. Ketamine combines great with MDMA and weed though.<br /><br />DMT is also a good option in combination with what you already have. Idk about alcohol, however.<br /><br />Alcohol kinda goes best by itself or with a stimulant like amphetamine or meth.
