				I was planning on bringing a variety of drugs to a festival, including lsd, 25i-nbome, mdma, 2cb and possibly DXM, and I was wondering if any of these would be dangerous to combine. I wasn&#039;t going to take any of them simultaneously, just one after the other, for instance 25i-nbome friday night, lsd in the day on saturday, mdma saturday night, 2cb/DXM. Any information is much appreciated.<br /><br />Also, some 25i-nbome is sold in 1200ug blotters on Silk Road, is this an excessive dose for a first time use? Reading through Erowid trip reports I see quite vivid effects from dosages in the range of 700-900ug. I&#039;ve tried LSD and 2cb before, so it wouldn&#039;t be my first psychedelic.

				Seems like a bad idea to me. DXM is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and MDMA also affects the serotonin system, sounds like a recipe for serotonin syndrome, or at least increased risk of neurotoxicity and long term damage. (Anybody with more knowledge about pharmacology feel free to correct me.) Also, 2cb, MDMA, DXM and 25i are all known to have cardiac side effects like increased blood pressure and tachycardia. You&#039;ll be putting a lot of stress on your heart, which combined with festival conditions also seems like a bad idea. 25i isn&#039;t well understood yet, either, but people have died from it and while I love the stuff, I&#039;d be real careful doing it in combination with anything. <br /><br />Re: 25i dosage, 1mg of complexed blotter was manageable for me as a first time trip, 1.5 was almost too much. I might start a little slower, especially given the setting.

Say i were to cut the DXM, would there be a likelihood of detrimental effects if I were to still take the 25i friday and the lsd/mdma saturday?

				dont get me wrong brother ill mix drugs. but usually only two and it will be with 2 things i think will synergize. <br />ive taken lsd and psilocybin together, ive taken lsd and mdma together, ive taken 25b-nbome and moxy together, ive taken 4-fa and psilocybin together, and every experience i have, im going to be smoking tobacco and marijuana at the same time. i just wouldnt mix all of those phenethylamines mayn. itd be overload for sure. i would stick with the candy flip maybe. i wouldnt even want to take 2c-b and 25i-nbome together really.<br /><br />&quot;you took too much man, too much too much.&quot;<br /><br />^dats what i picture it to be like. lol. save the other drugs for another day id say =).<br /><br />and ive had maybe 3 or 4 experiences with dxm. (okay maybe like 5 or 6) but i definitely have to&nbsp; the conclusion that its an immensely shitty drug. makes my eyes go crossed and makes me literally feel like shit. muscles feel tensed up and hense, the &quot;robowalk&quot;<br />ironic that the source is cough medicine -__-<br />but who knows man, i wouldnt ever mix it with a psychedelic but it sounds like it would be interesting.<br />i do know it greatly increases the risk of serotonin syndrome though.

				Yeah that makes sense, I&#039;ll just stick to the candyflip man. DXM was just something i was thinking about trying, as the only dissociative experience I&#039;ve had is nos which obviously only lasts less than a minute, I&#039;ll stay away from it with your advice, thanks a lot for the help.<br /><br />I wanted to trip both friday and saturday, and I wanted to take the LSD separately from the MDMA because i&#039;ve never experienced MDMA on its own, but I may just take them together as everyone seems to think candyflips are awesome.

				DXM is funny, most people either love it or hate it. I enjoy it, but a lot of people basically get motion sickness from it and spend the whole time miserable as shit. Or crazy allergy reactions (robo-itch). <br /><br />Your new plan sounds good. I would definitely not do 25i with other stuff unless I was in a fairly controlled setting, had somebody to check my BP and stuff. I&#039;ve heard 2c-b and MDMA are awesome together, though. Also, I&#039;ve done LSD and 2c-b together and found the experience really nice. Almost like a candyflip in terms of the body high, but not as mentally intense (for me anyway, your mileage may vary). LSD is safe as hell and 2c-b is pretty safe too if you respect it, take reasonable dosages and listen to your body.<br /><br />Have fun man.

				I was just interested in seeing what dissociatives were like man, they sound like a unique experience. I&#039;ll have to try it another time.<br />It&#039;s weird, when I had 2cb, I had 25mg and possibly a little more, and I had very strong visuals but no MDMA &#039;buzz&#039; people usually describe, which is why I&#039;m interested in trying MDMA. <br /><br />Thanks a lot strangeman!
