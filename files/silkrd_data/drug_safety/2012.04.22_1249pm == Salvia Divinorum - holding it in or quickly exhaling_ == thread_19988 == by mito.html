				Is it like marijuana where the longer you keep in your lungs, the greater the effects?<br /><br />I just read the Meth thread on this topic, and it says that 3 seconds is the max, anything longer is wasting your lungs.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve always been told to hold salvia in. The longer the better. If you do it right you don&#039;t remember blowing out the smoke cos you&#039;re well gone by then. Not sure how true this is but it seems to affect me more when I hold it in

				Yeah with salvia if you remember exhaling your not holding it long enough :) if you dont want a really strong experience i guess you could blow out sooner but whats the point :D

				im not aware of much work being done into salvia but seeing as its not smoked often (in most cases) its most likely relatively harmless.<br /><br />Or i could be wrong and it gives us all cancer

				I&#039;ve always held it in until I&#039;m &#039;gone&#039;, similar to what Prawl42 said. I&#039;ve understood it to be like DMT, which is the longer you hold your breath the better you absorb it. My method is packing a small amount into my honeycomb bowl, then torching it with a triple-jet vector lighter in my ROOR. It&#039;s never failed to give me a breakthrough. ;) I&#039;m still afraid of Salvia every time though, as it always feels like my body is being literally ripped through dimensions.

				I&#039;ve found that holding it in for as long as possible will always result in the strongest trip. As for it being dangerous, I&#039;d imagine it would be much less dangerous than cannabis if only because you need to smoke only very small amounts of extract to feel the effects.
