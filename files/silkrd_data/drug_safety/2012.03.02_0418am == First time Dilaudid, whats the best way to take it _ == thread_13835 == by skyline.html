				Hey SR community ;)<br /><br />First of all i must say that i&#039;m a h customer for 12 years and since 5 years i get Methadone. What i want to say is that my tolarence is very high...<br /><br />Id love to get high again but its very hard to realize cause my daily M (100mg). Thats the point where comes Dilaudid in the game...<br /><br />I dont really want to shoot it but if i don&#039;t expect a good buzz from plugging it even with my tolerance i would shoot it...<br /><br />What do you prefer guys and what do you mean is the best way to do it (whole process) and which dosage seems the best for me, 4 or 8g ?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, pls help...<br /><br /><br />

				Shoot that shit.&nbsp; The high is ok if you take it orally or snort it but if you shoot it it&#039;s a whole different level.&nbsp; I&#039;d say start with the 4.&nbsp; I shot an 8 and got serious nods where I woke up with a bite of bagel in my mouth.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although this is all coming from a lightweight user and you sound like you&#039;re a bit of pro so take what I say with a grain of salt.&nbsp;

				Thanks tcobambientAgain for your help. i also thought about the 4g pill first...<br /><br />What i need to know is if any dilaudids are crushable and do i need a microfilter ?<br /><br />Should i make it the &quot;normal&quot; way and crush the pill in the spoon put some water on it and mix it ? Should it completly disolve in water ? Should i know anything else ?<br /><br />

				All you need to do is just crush them in a spoon and add water.&nbsp; At least that was the way I had them in 2008.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t have to filter them or do anything special.&nbsp; Just crush, add water and it dissolves completely.&nbsp;

				It was so funny.&nbsp; I shot up and decided I was hungry so I went to the kitchen to make a bagel.&nbsp; Sat down and took a bite of it and the next thing I know I&#039;m coming to with bagel in my mouth.&nbsp; <br /><br />It really is a great high.&nbsp; If only that shit wasn&#039;t so expensive.&nbsp; I had 90 after neck surgery and decided to check Erowid on ways to take them and saw the best way was to shoot them.&nbsp; I had a pic line in my arm so it was really easy.&nbsp;
