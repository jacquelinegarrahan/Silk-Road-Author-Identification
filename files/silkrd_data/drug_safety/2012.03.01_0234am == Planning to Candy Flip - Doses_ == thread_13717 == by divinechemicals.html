				So I&#039;ve done MDMA and LSD individually, but now I am ready to combine the two. In the past, I have normally done 250-300 mg of MDMA when I roll, and I honestly don&#039;t know the dosage of LSD I have done, but it was a normal tab so from what I&#039;ve read, probably around 100 ug. I just don&#039;t know how much I should do of each to have a good candy flip. I am planning to have sex while flipping, so I don&#039;t know if that would change how much to do, but any help would be much appreciated.

				Yeah I&#039;m still trying to figure this out too it seems the MDMA always overpowers the LSD for me unless I&#039;m taking 500+mcg of LSD ...

				One thing I learned the hard way about candy flipping, is to NOT set your dosage up to where the MDMA will start to wear off while the LSD is still running strong. Good feelings will NOT ensue. (especially if you have a rough time coming down from E, which seems to get worse and worse the more you dose it) <br />I&#039;d say get your LSD trip going real nice, a few hours into it dose a good hit of molly and be prepared to dose molly again as the L wears down. Either way you cut it I never really found a proper balance to have a decent come-down. But holy shiiiiieet the feeling that those substances give your body and brain at the same time! Worth it. ;D&nbsp; Pleasant tripping and Happy Schwag! (or Schwappy Hag if you are one of the cool kids, lol)

				My best experience was with 50mg MDMA + ~300mcg LSD at the same time, then 150mg of MDMA 2.5 hours later.

				Personally I drop around 100 mg of molly as soon as I feel the first effects of the acid, then when I feel the acid is at its peak I&#039;ll bump a small amount of molly (25-50 mg), then I take more molly as needed to maintain. I agree with rhcp don&#039;t let yourself crash on the molly while still tripping, its not fun :( . Honestly this is probably my favorite combo have fun! 8)
