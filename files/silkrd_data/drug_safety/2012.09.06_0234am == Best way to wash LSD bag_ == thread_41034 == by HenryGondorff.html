				I have a bag I have stored some sheets in and was noticing there appears to be some residue left over (only 1 it left).&nbsp; Wondering what would be the best way to go about getting the residue off...&nbsp; Everclear then put in a drink?&nbsp; I imagine I should probably take small sips or split with two-three folks while doing this.&nbsp; Anybody have some good tips?

				Water soluble? Yes. You need to be sure you use distilled water. Chlorine in water will destroy some of the lysergic acid diethylamide on contact. <br /><br />I think itd be hard to judge how much actual lsd and the ug&#039;s is left behind so be very careful while trying whatever route you are taking or you are in for a ride!<br /><br />I think washing it with grain alcohol ( to assure full solubility)&nbsp; would be your best way to go then carefully divide this between a few drinks and hope for the best <br /><br />

				I&#039;d use grain alcohol (make sure it&#039;s this type) I guess distilled water wouldn&#039;t be a bad alternative to get it off the bag your choice. I don&#039;t see any reason to add water after though if you&#039;ve used the alcohol to wash it off. I&#039;d say approx. 10cc or so of solution to wash it off and split this up into a few doses. I&#039;d&nbsp; think you&#039;ll have trouble with the dosage unless you have the right equipment to be able to determine how much product is actually there. Best of luck to you, and let us know how this journey goes!
