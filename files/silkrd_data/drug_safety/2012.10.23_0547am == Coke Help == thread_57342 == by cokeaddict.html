				I&#039;m a street dealer in my area and when I re-up I usually do a line to see how good it is.<br /><br />Problem is I&#039;ve become extremely addicted over the last year and recently quit cold turkey.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m feeling nausea, sweating profusely in a cold room, and having terrible migraines.<br /><br />Tips for getting rid of these symptoms quicker?<br /><br />Also tips for telling how good the coke is without actually trying it?

				I really sympathize with you. Many years ago, I was in a similar situation to yourself, and needed to find the most appropriate way to detox, I am stubborn when it comes to doctors, and prescribed medicines, and prefer to detox naturally through a combination of diet, rest, and time. Cocaine stays present in the body for up to three days, however if your heavily addicted, it may stay in your body for slightly longer.<br /><br />If you would like to take the natural approach, you need to drink plenty of cranberry juice, it&#039;s excellent for aiding recovery as the body starts to naturally cleanse and purify itself, copious amounts of water and broths will help too. If you begin to sweat, it&#039;s a good sign, as it&#039;s one of your natural defenses for clearing out toxins, but you will loose a lot of potassium through this process that will make you feel very week, bananas, melons, tomatoes, and green leafy vegetables are all beneficial for uptaking your potassium levels back to a healthy level. You may start shaking or have difficulty sleeping (I had this in spades) eliminate caffeine consumption, and replace with decaffeinated drinks. A glass of warm milk can aid sleep, herbal teas, such as camomile is a good sleep aid, green tea is also great as it is rich in antioxidants. Natural herbs and vitamin supplements are also beneficial, in terms of cocaine withdrawal the recommended ones are, Passion Flower for anxiety, St John&#039;s Roots and Kava Kava for depression, Sage aids with sweating. In terms of vitamins you need amino acid L-Tyrosine and Pyridoxine to restore neurotransmitter levels, and Vitamin C to boost your immune system, and Melatonin will help you to sleep.<br /><br />To answer how you can test cocaine for purity, there&#039;s a company online called EZ Test (they&#039;ve been mentioned a few times here, just do a search), the one you&#039;ll need is their Cocaine Purity Test, while not completely definitive it will not tell you which cuts are present, it will tell you the purity of your coke. If you want to know which cuts are present in your coke they also do a test for cocaine adulterants, called the EZ Test for Cocaine Cuts, which will react to Levamisole, Phenacetin, and Ephedrine. It&#039;s best to purchase both tests for a comprehensive result. Alternatively, as Limetless mentioned there is also the Clorex bleach test. Hope this assists you, and the best of luck for a speedy detox and recovery :)

				Can&#039;t comment on the addiction part of the post, but I&#039;d say a good acetone wash would clean your product right up brother. <br /><br />Kudos to one, quitting cold turkey, and two, still selling/handling coke regularly without fucking up your sobriety. Your self control reminds me of mine. Even though I don&#039;t sell it.

				PrincessH touched on most of the info. Certainly take Vitamin E and ALA also. Very potent antioxidants. <br /><br />Did you become this was from only that line you did to test quality every re-up? Or did you get heavy into it? Curious - what was your use before you decided to quit?<br /><br />Good luck. If things get really bad, Valium is excellent to sleep and long half-life keeps everything chill for the whole day. (1 per eve) But don&#039;t end up trading 1 problem for another.

				you will find this link helpfull <br /><br />Clearnet--http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0701/p139.html<br /><br />Drug: Stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines and derivatives)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Peak period: 1 to 3 days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Duration: 5 to 7 days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Signs: Social withdrawal, psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Symptoms: Depression, anhedonia, suicidal thoughts and behavior, paranoid delusions<br /><br />Stimulants (Cocaine, Amphetamines and Derivatives)<br /><br />Supportive rather than specific treatment is indicated in patients who are undergoing withdrawal from stimulants. Observation and monitoring for depression and suicidal ideation are advised (Table 1). Since stimulant withdrawal may cause significant irritability, a dosage of 5 to 10 mg of diazepam given orally every six hours on a fixed schedule or as needed for two to three days is recommended in patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms. For severe withdrawal symptoms with persistent depression, therapy may be initiated with antidepressants such as desipramine (Norpramin), at a dosage of 50 mg per day, titrated upward every other day in 50-mg increments until a dosage of 150 to 250 mg per day is attained. The dosage is maintained for three to six months and discontinued by gradually tapering the drug over two weeks.4,9 However, desipramine is not recommended routinely for management of withdrawal.<br /><br />You can get 99.99999% of all the stuff you need to home detox on clear net or SR market or the street.
