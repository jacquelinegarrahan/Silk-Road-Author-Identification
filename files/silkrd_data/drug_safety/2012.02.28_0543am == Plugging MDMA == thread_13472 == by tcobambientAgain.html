				I&#039;ve never done MDMA before and heard that plugging (yes, putting it in your ass) gives you a better high.&nbsp; I have some coming in this week, which I believe is crystal and have been thinking about how I was going to take it.&nbsp; First off, does this make me gay for doing it (I&#039;m totally kidding).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure there are people who have a lot of experience with MDMA and can provide some answers.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve thought about this on occasion. Never tried it. I&#039;d say, put a dose in an oral syringe, dissolve in distilled water and shoot it up your bum. No, does not make you gay. But it&#039;ll probably make you shit, lol. Why does MDMA always make me shit? lol

				So I should expect to shit on MDMA even if I take it orally?&nbsp; I am seriously thinking about doing the oral syringe with the dissolved MDMA for my first time though.&nbsp; I think it takes less to get your trip and it&#039;s a better trip.&nbsp; As far as what I&#039;ve read.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I am gay though and just looking for an excuse to put something in my ass?&nbsp; I&#039;m kidding.&nbsp; I hate that sarcasm doesn&#039;t travel over the internet.&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t do it for the first time. MDMA for the first time is a very &quot;enlightening&quot; experience. Not like LSD, but nonetheless very very profound.<br /><br />However, if you use a route of administration that hammers you, e.g. snorting or plugging, you&#039;ll prolly perceive your first roll more like being on speed or something similar.<br /><br />Nana, first time E is definitely an oral thing imho, especially since you got crystal, trust me, you parachute crystal that shit comes on fast and hard enough.

				Johny&#039;s got a point there. Particularly, I&#039;m thinking about the dosage now. Should plugging dosage be less than you would take orally? idk, but I&#039;m thinking yes. I&#039;ve never parachuted the stuff though. I did make up gelcaps before, but IMO, not good idea. When I drop the crystal under my tongue, that shit comes on in like 20 mins. The gelcaps would take an hour+ at least to come up.

				Thanks for all the advice.&nbsp; I was told to take it orally but I read it takes a lot less if you plug and I just got a sample of 200mg.&nbsp; My plan was to dissolve it in water and just inject it rectally.&nbsp; Not to actually put the hard crystals in my ass.&nbsp; I&#039;m debating.&nbsp; I just got it in today&#039;s mail and just thinking about the right situation to do it in.&nbsp; My first time I may just do it at home and chill out to see what the effects are.

Administer it however you want (I would go orally to be honest) but make sure where you&#039;re doing it is sure to be good fun surrounded by your friends. <br /><br />200mg is enough for an initial dose of 130mg then a re-dose at 70mg and that should have you rolling pretty nicely if it&#039;s your first time and if it&#039;s relatively pure.

				Yeah 200mg is way enough first time, even if it ain&#039;t all that great. See with MDMA it&#039;s about your initial 2 doses anyways. They have a &quot;sweet spot&quot;. It&#039;s not like, oh my first 200mg didn&#039;t get me that high lets add another 100mg, the third dose usually does shit regardless of amount. If you don&#039;t get rolling out of your mind on 200 for the first time then that won&#039;t improve with more or by route of administration.<br /><br />BTW<br /><br />Gelcaps. The ones used for BCAA supplements are designed to dissolve really really quickly. Get BCAA caps and you&#039;re on after 20 to 25 minutes, just like parachuting.

				I have a friend who swears this is the best thing ever. He uses a syringe (minus the needle!) to squirt a crushed pill/crystal mixed with a little water up his ass. Apparently this method works well with coke, ket etc as well, because your rectum has a lot more blood vessels than your nose and you can feel it work its way up your spine.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to have the balls to try it but i dont think i could violate myself in such a way without feeling slightly gay.

				Maybe people making a deal out of it have never been administered a suppository in all their life?<br /><br />Ya know, not too long ago, say 20 years or so, most fever medications for kids were suppositories, they were much more common then.<br /><br />Although, admittedly, I have my reservations about sticking drugs up my ass myself tbh :)

				It is only gay if you are a Guy, the object is a Dick, and you enjoyed it.<br /><br />Forget the water syringe silliness. I hear that method a lot, but it is pointless. Just push the whole pill up there with your finger. The goal is to push it up there about 1.5&quot; (one and a half inches). That is where there is a big collection of blood vessels which will absorb the MDMA the fastest.<br /><br />I only plug MDMA pills... shoot I forget the exact %&#039;s but MDMA is absorbed far better up the ass then swallowed. MDMA also causes some minor intestinal problems when swallowed, but when taken up the ass the small intestine is bypassed. The effects are cleaner, stronger, and last longer.... now I mite be wrong about this one (it also allows the MDMA to reach the brain before it is processed by the liver/kidneys, so on top of more being absorbed even more is active).<br /><br />In my opinion, all other methods of MDMA administration are a waste.

I thought about getting crystal and how to plug that too.<br /><br />I guess the syringe with out the needle attached would would in this case be good way. Because I don&#039;t have a syringe I was linking about like putting it in the bottom (longer half) of a gelcap and not putting the top half on, so you don&#039;t have to wait for the gel to dissolve. Then plug then open end with a peace of bread. The bread should dissolve fairly quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Maybe someone can give me some advice:&nbsp; I did my first X in 1985-86, a small yellow tablet.&nbsp; A totally unbelievable experience--went to see&nbsp; Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, made out with a black girl I didn&#039;t even know...Every subsequent experience, and there were many, were just as unbelievable (minus the black chick).&nbsp; At that time we would get these huge wafer tabs--I don&#039;t know what the dose was.&nbsp; In the &#039;90&#039;s I started getting all these little stamped pills, most of which were awesome.&nbsp; Every once in a while you&#039;d find some bogus pills, then in the late &#039;90&#039;s they were ALL bogus.&nbsp; Then my sources dried up, and I didn&#039;t have any until I found SR (thank you, Lord).<br /><br />We had always just taken pills, dosage unknown.&nbsp; So when faced with powder, I did some research and figured with my body weigh I would need about .15, which I took at 6:00 pm.&nbsp; After two hours, I died another .15.&nbsp; An hour later, I ate something and went to sleep.&nbsp; Not exactly as I remembered.&nbsp; Since then I&#039;ve tried a number of combinations of dosages and means of ingestion.&nbsp; The only time I really got off was when I took .2 g.,&nbsp; then over several hours snorted probably about the same amount.<br /><br />Any suggestions?&nbsp; While the idea of plugging doesn&#039;t sound like my idea of a good time, If it works...If I should decide to try it, what dose, do you think?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any input..

Or maybe you&#039;re just not doing it right. Eating is a big no no. You shouldn&#039;t eat for at least four hours before E. Personally, I follow a preloading regimen of a variety of vitamins and 5-HTP, plenty of juices. Then on roll day, I fast the whole day (except for vitamins and juices) and finally drop my dose at party time. Given my weight, tolerance and how I like to roll, I always drop .2 to start, the only question is how much I wanna follow up with, either .1 or .2. I&#039;d never do less than .3 in a night, and hopefully not more than .5 if I&#039;m gettin really crazy, lol. But it happens.

				Last summer I was such a slut for mdma, I was rolling hard getting all tingly and sexed up on the bed, then I snorted some and put some crystal on my finger and in to anus. Those crystals would tingle there it felt very good and painful at the same time but after 5minutes had to go for a shit. Some wasted molly~<br /><br />so my tips would be to eat nice and healthy day before<br />at the day of roll<br />try to take a nice morning shit and maybe eating something very light and drink some healthy ass drink.<br /><br />great feeling to take mdma would be lets say like after a nice shit feeling very light and the body energized just before you actually get hungry. Not stomach full of dead animal bits and candies all bloated up. The ecstasy will work even if you just ate but I think it would be harder to feel some effects of mdma.<br /><br />If you want to plug (I really think it&#039;s worth trying altough I wouldn&#039;t try with my last roll/0.1g)&nbsp; mix the mdma with a little bit of water in the syringe and squirt it chill on your side for a couple of minutes after 15-25mins while looking in the mirror you are asking yourself &quot;who is this very good looking person?&quot;

				Since it is crystal (especially if you&#039;re getting it from europe), I say divide them up into 50mg doses. Dissolve one dose into a small cup of juice (orange is pretty good) and drink. Take another 50mg every 30 minutes until all is right with the world or you&#039;re unable to go through the motions of dissolving a dose to drink (whichever strength you prefer). <br /><br />To maximize the potency, take 50mg of 5-htp about 2 hours before rolling and make sure your stomach is completely empty (have a light healthy meal and fast for a good 4-5 hours before taking your first dose). <br /><br />When I do the above, it will hit me hard in about 10 minutes (with 80% puity holland brown sugar crystals).

				Ah.&nbsp; I was on Prozac since 1996 so there&#039;s probably a nice little build up in my system.&nbsp; I would think the Kpin would have been out of my system though after about 18 hours.&nbsp; Or of course it could have just been not very good stuff.&nbsp; I think I may go back in a few months and try it again and see how it goes.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m 6&#039;2, 230 pounds so maybe it just wasn&#039;t enough to hit me at my size.&nbsp; I know there are certain drugs where I have to take more than normal.&nbsp;

				Gonna give this a shot via the dissolve in water, put in syringe method of insertion.

So as long as i can hold that off then this method looks like it&#039;s got the green light for a success ride&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Also general consensus is only a small amount of water needed, 2-5 ml ?

				I can speak from experience that from only using escitalopram (Cipralex) for about 9 months ( at 10mg &amp; then 20mg doses daily) that even after 4 weeks I couldn&#039;t completely feel the effects of an mdma roll. I&#039;m trying again the third week of July at an outdoor, and that will have been at least 3 full months plus from the last time I was on the SSRI. <br /><br />I am concerned that the habitual use of cocaine has been detrimental. I&#039;ve been experimenting with loading regimens and that is still a work in progress. Abstaining is doubtful st this point.<br /><br />One last thing: your set/setting have a major impact, don&#039;t forget. I always have the most fun the more that&#039;s going on. Music events for me are the best. Somewhere you know a lot of people (or go as a group), and there are a lot of strangers you can meet. Somewhere with an open/accept everyone type of place/event.
