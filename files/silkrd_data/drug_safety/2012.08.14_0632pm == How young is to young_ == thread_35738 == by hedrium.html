				LSD, shrooms, and MDMA should be fine, as long as you don&#039;t go overboard. Kinda depends on what you&#039;re looking for though. I wouldn&#039;t suggest trying DMT if you have very limited drug experience, its fucking insane.

				Meta this is probably a fishing thread where journos get people to tell them what horrific drugs to do so they can go back and say that we are all monsters and child abusers/molesters. No 15 year old would admit to being 15 or at leas they&#039;d have to be particularly naive.

				Don&#039;t do drugs yet. You&#039;re seriously gonna have an ego-trip thinking you don&#039;t have an ego and think you&#039;re too good for school, then you won&#039;t be able to get a job at McDonald&#039;s because you don&#039;t even have a high school diploma.

				Way too young. I would at least wait until I&#039;m 18.&nbsp; ;)<br />Not because it is the age of consent or anything, but only because when one is older, one is able to have a deeper experience, due to additional experiences and knowledge of life&nbsp; And yes, personal identity is still shaping during the teenage years, so it would be a bad idea to shatter it so young. I&#039;d personally would advise to be much older, so the experience can be richer. <br /><br />Stick to the weed.&nbsp;

There have been little to no long term studies as to how these changes effect a growing mind. How young is to young is an open question that the US Scheduling system will not allow anyone to study and find out. <br /><br />I took shrooms for the first time at 30, and to be honest I love them. So there is never a too old but there is a good chance that there is a too young. <br /><br />Knowledge is power so take your time, learn what they do and how they do it, and wait tell you are ready.

				You see, like I have said in other threads to do with this topic I was doing Class A when I was 14 however I do realize that this probably wasn&#039;t a good idea. I sort of accept the fact kids will be shopping on here, it&#039;s just something you will have to deal with as a vendor and come to terms with in your own way, we can&#039;t stop it so what else can we do? What I do resent is kids telling your age and then putting us in a position where we have to either sell to kids or refuse them. <br /><br />So ultimately, kids if you are watching this shut the fuck up about your age. Vendors don&#039;t want to know.

				Drug use is a fact of life for young people and society. You are probably already using non prescription drugs such as coffee, alcohol, etc and other prescription ones such as pain killers. We ALL take drugs ALL of the time, understand that a drug isn&#039;t a label. There are no good or bad drugs, there are just different ones with different upsides and downsides.<br /><br />The fact that you have asked for advice about your age shows that you have a level of maturity about this. So discount the replies that suggest you are too young etc. Ultimately you make the decision on what to take and when to take it., making sure you understand the risks involved. I am middle aged and I am still taking new drugs but I use scientific sources of information to inform my drug taking and not my dealer/s. <br /><br />So the top rules kids are (this goes for adults as well).<br /><br />1. Research and understand your chosen drug wisely before taking it! Good sources for drug advice on the internet are Erowid, bluelight and the DMT nexus. Unlike here shouting off about your age in the DMT nexus will get you banned. So don&#039;t do it and be polite on the forums even if you think you are being lectured to. There is huge wealth of good quality information and experiences on these sites.<br /><br />2. Be aware that the brain is changing chemically more than you can throw at it with drugs in your teenage years. Throwing drugs at the brain when it is not prepared for it either mentally or chemically is never a good idea.<br /><br />3. Decide what level of risk you are comfortable with once you understand the downside to the drug you are taking.&nbsp; Then factor in what is called optimism bias. This is our belief that everything will work out ok, it is a good mental mechanism to stop us going crazy with worry. But during your teenage years this isn&#039;t really working that well yet. This is why you worry about your looks, being part of the gang, getting socially accepted, you are forming the mental assumptions that you will take on in the world and your identity at this time. Your calculations on risk are hugely overestimated at this age, you have nothing to lose. <br /><br />4. Chose your friends and drug taking buddies wisely! Try to find someone in your family that you can talk to about this. We all have the slightly liberal minded, hippiy in our family (that is me), go to them. and ask for advice. If you can&#039;t talk to a family member think about your friend&#039;s parents. Who are the ones who seem to have a good open minded relationship with their children. The parents that you secretly want? Talk to them about it, they won&#039;t tell your parents if you ask them for advice and experiences. They may tell your parents if you turn up high in front of them or say you are taking them. Don&#039;t admit to anything ask for advice.<br /><br />5. But avoid generally advice from family members or friends that; could have an overt religious agenda or have no experience with the drug, or a limited scientific understanding of the drug. Not saying these people can&#039;t give good advice they can, but it may be not helpful, and limited in depth. Not taking something because it is a sin for example is not a good way to educate and reduce harm.<br /><br />6. Dose small and then work up. Understand the effects of re dosing&nbsp; and then set a re-dose plan and stick to it. You will get another chance another day to go further if you want. Realise and accept that you have to come down, if you understand your drug well&nbsp; you can accept the come down or even mitigate the effects. Don&#039;t chase the high and make bad decisions. But also don&#039;t play around with threshold doses, the bad effects of come up are felt as we move from the threshold to a working dose. Understand your dose levels for all your drugs, and be cautious until you know better, because you will one day take too much of your drug, coffee can kill as well!<br /><br />7. Choose your set and setting carefully for all drugs. Consider law enforcement, potential long term consequences, and reduce the risk of these happening. Don&#039;t be stupid and brash, don&#039;t underestimate the police and law enforcement. They have seen it all and done it all, and in your teenage years you may think you are being clever but you are not. Much better to ensure that the chances of drugs and the law are not in the same place. So don&#039;t go to loud house party which is in a residential area with shit loads of gear on you!<br /><br />8. It is OK to experiment, stay away from anything that is chemically addictive at this stage. If don&#039;t know the difference between chemical and psychological addiction then you haven&#039;t done enough research.&nbsp; Ask your science teachers for any peer reviewed evidence on the drug you want to take check out non partisan government information.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.drugscience.org.uk/ is a good place to start.<br /><br />9. You will break the set, setting and re-dosing rules at one point. However if you have considered them in the first place the harm that will come from breaking them is reduced. Before taking a drug, stop, take a deep breath in and out. Our rational decision making is better when breathing slowly and deeply, and think do I know what the worse that can happen if I take this drug here and now is? Have I removed the risk factors that would increase the worse thing happening. One day you will fuck it up so reduce the consequences of this before hand.<br /><br />10. Go have some fun, sport and active life is actually more rewarding that a drug haze. It is why we do drugs to stimulate the dopamine responses in our brain. You can get this from exercise and adventure sports as well, sometimes these are as risky as the drugs themselves. But if you understand the scientific risks well then you will make good decisions.<br /><br />11. Maintain a healthy body in which to take drug in. Exercise, and eat fresh food. This will improve your drug taking and ensure you reduce the risks of long term damage. <br /><br />12. Take breaks and space your drug taking apart, try not to do combinations. Unless you have done both individually, and then low dosed them together.<br />

				Whilst I believe this is indeed either a media type or a troll (judging by their other topic here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35927.msg409809#msg409809), I&#039;m afraid that I have to go against the grain here and disagree with posters whose views I&#039;d normally share on a lot of issues.<br /><br />Regardless of this person&#039;s intentions, who are we to tell someone that they are &#039;too young&#039; to do drugs? We&#039;re sending a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; message. We have no right to do that, and no &#039;moral high ground&#039; to do it from.<br />Who are we to decide that someone shouldn&#039;t experience the freedoms that we can experience? Especially, if this had been a real 15 year old, they have the maturity and forethought to ask people they know to be drug users which drugs would be safer to for someone of his/her age and weight.<br />The OP asked a question pertaining to drug safety, in the Drug Safety section of this forum. Would it not be better to recommend drugs that would be less harmful to them than others, and not act like we&#039;re holier-than-thou, rather than giving them a &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot; approach?<br />They&#039;re not interested in methamphetimine or cocaine.<br /><br />People are worried about what the media will write?! The media aren&#039;t going to come along and write &quot;Most users replying to the 15 year old advised them not to do drugs at all - very responsible group of people altogether!&quot; because news like that doesn&#039;t sell.<br />THEY are in the business of selling newspapers, and increasing advertising revenue by increasing their market share using shock headlines to pique the interest of the masses.<br />WE are in the business of buying and selling drugs, supporting the provision of that freedom to those who are denied it and actively encouraging a sense of community for EVERYONE that comes here. Let&#039;s not kid ourselves, none of us are angels in the view of the masses. In my own case the only drugs I&#039;ve ever used are alcohol, caffeine, ephedrine, and viagra. Two of which are legal in my country, one of which was recently banned, and another of which is available on prescription. I do sell drugs though. I provide product to others, just as others provide product to me, and others provide product to them. This makes me as much of &#039;a criminal&#039; as anyone else here. In truth, not one of us is a criminal at all. In reality, however, each of us is somebody who is out to kill and eat the first born child of every closed-minded family in the world.<br /><br />Well.. Fuck the media. Fuck the prohibitionists. Fuck the &#039;do-gooders&#039; who kick up a storm if their personal views aren&#039;t shared by absolutely everybody. Fuck the &#039;drugs are bad&#039; attitude. Fuck government oppression and the views of the majority being forced upon the minority. Fuck not even taking into account that the majority&#039;s views probably aren&#039;t even being listened to. Fuck spineless politicians who are too scared of losing votes to broach the subject of decriminalisation and legalisation. Fuck the wars they start against inanimate objects such as drugs, and intangible ideals such as terrorism. You can&#039;t fight a war against drugs, nor a war against terror. How the fuck do you defeat an ideal?! Fuck &#039;moral highgrounds&#039;. Fuck the members of law enforcement agencies for acting on behalf of a state that bullies it&#039;s citizens. Fuck the good members of those law enforcement agencies who joined to protect the weak and downtrodden, but fail to do so, and fail to hold their brethren to account for their actions. Fuck members of the judiciary who feel they have some sort of right to pass judgement on another human being. Fuck the system; it&#039;s broken. It was designed to be broken, so that the weaker members of society wouldn&#039;t have a voice. Fuck government secrecy and lack of transparency. Fuck humans that &#039;kill for their country&#039;. How can one believe they are justified taking another&#039;s life in defense of an imaginary border, represented by a line which was drawn on a map so many years ago?! Fuck being controlled. Fuck taking orders from anyone. Fuck bending to the will of our oppressors. Fuck them telling us we need protection from ourselves. Fuck &#039;republics&#039; and &#039;democracies&#039;, &#039;dictatorships&#039; and &#039;theocracies&#039; - all of those words mean the same thing in reality - &#039;control of the populace.&#039; Fuck going off on tangents like this, and getting so angry because we are being treated as slaves being spoon-fed bits of &#039;freedom&#039; here and there, as long as we follow the rules - newsflash: that is not freedom. Fuck the lack of compassion we show our fellow human beings. But most of all, fuck me. Fuck me for just sitting here behind a computer screen, safe behind my anonymising software and anonymous set-up. Fuck me for not getting out there in the streets and demanding freedom, and not resting until I, alongside every single free thinker on this planet, have achieved freedom for all. Yes, even for the most vile members of our societies, the politicians and their agents who would wish to enslave us. Guarantee freedom for them, and you guarantee freedom for everyone. Fuck me. Read that again. Read it aloud. &quot;Fuck me.&quot; Repeat it aloud.<br />That is what we are saying to the government every time we run and hide. That is what we are saying every time we censor ourselves so as not to draw their attention or their ire. So I&#039;ll say it again: fuck the media.<br /><br />To our mysterious and odd, potentially 15 year old OP: research the drugs you wish to take. Read reviews on here. Read other people&#039;s experiences. Search them out. Research their limits, benefits, and ill-effects. Read. Just keep reading. Educate yourself, and don&#039;t let anybody else ever force their views upon you, regardless of what they think their intentions are. Strive for freedom, and be happy with nothing less.<br /><br />To all the rest of you: I have no idea where all that just came from. And I&#039;m not drunk on alcohol, buzzed off caffeine or ephedrine, or sitting here with raging viagra hard-on. Perhaps it&#039;s time I DID try some other drugs. Fuck I&#039;m uptight! :D<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				In medieval times you&#039;d already have kids and probably be a peasant farmer... However, in our times, you&#039;re still a boy. I started using drugs when I was 13 and I had a long, rough, and very troublesome road before I got a grip on my drug use. I went to jail, alternative education programs, and even a fucking boarding school for almost a year. Oh my 18th birthday present was a 2 month stint at a homeless shelter in a corn town hundreds of miles from home. These consequences were all directly or indirectly related to drugs. It made me who I am today but maybe I would&#039;ve been a much greater man if I didn&#039;t use.<br /><br />Enjoy your youth man...

				Ultimately its up to you. The fact that you&#039;re asking for advice tells me you&#039;re shaping up to be a responsible drug user, which is a very good thing. In my advice, stick to Cannabis for awhile. Cannabis is pretty much harmless and can show you a lot of things. Remember that things like DMT, LSD, and Psilocybin are not in the same class of substances as Methamphetamine or Cocaine. Psychedelics are not really drugs at all, they are more like spiritual teachers in substance form. They are there so the user can choose when he or she would like to invoke such life-changing experiences. I would hold off on psychedelics for awhile, as the adult mind is better at receiving and processing the beautiful things they will show you in time.<br /><br />TL;DR- Stick with pot for awhile, its great fun at that age. Things like LSD, DMT, and Psilocybin however are much more serious and to get the most out of them you should wait until you are a bit older.<br /><br />Best of luck, be safe.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shifty

				Shifty I get what you&#039;re saying but psychedelics are most definitely drugs. Also most people who smoke cannabis don&#039;t do other drugs but most people who do other drugs smoke cannabis. So in a sense it is a gateway drug. It definitely made it easier for me to justify using other drugs.

The thing is that psychedelics are so vastly different from things like opiates and amphetamines. They are not so well known by the majority of the population, not so much as things like cocaine and cannabis are at least. The western societal definition of drugs (evil, addicting, life-shattering) is almost tailor-made for things like Opiates, amphetamines, and cocaine. That is why i like to refer to psychedelics as being of a different class of substances, as in they provide enlightenment like no other group of substances do. However, i certainly wouldn&#039;t advise using them regularly at such a young impressionable age. Responsible drug use is something to strive for in my opinion, and that includes knowing when and when not to consume certain kinds.<br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />Shifty

				Most young people will do drugs despite warnings from others (I did), but at the very least do it in moderation. I&#039;d say 15 is a fine age to smoke pot every so often, once you&#039;re 16-17 you can begin experimenting with mushrooms two or three times a year along with smoking weed a little bit more at parties and such, 17-18 I highly recommend you try 200µg after the first quarter of your senior year in high school along with smoking a bit more bud and taking a few more shrooms, and last of all once you&#039;ve graduated and have begun working you&#039;ve finally matured enough to take whatever you damn well please.. Once again in moderation of course. ;)

				You know I&#039;m sorry guys, but telling a 15yr old (if that&#039;s true anyways) to do the research and be responsible about it is just broken and overshadowed by libertarian bias that displaces reality.<br /><br />One of the biggest hallmarks, trademarks, traits whatever you wanna call it of the developing, pubescent brain is a marked incapability to properly evaluate risk and consequence.<br /><br />So kiddo, if you are who you claim, give yourself time, there&#039;s no rush. Wait a few years until all the hormonal craziness of puberty is over or at least toning down. You say you are smart, then stay smart and give your brain the time it needs to develop a well defined personality. Then you can go and start meddling with your mind.

				If the OP already is on SR then they really must know a thing or two about drugs...<br />I first did drugs at 15 started with weed (@14) had already started experimenting with alcohol (as I&#039;m assuming OP has)<br />SO basically, how smart are you? If you really think you have a grip on whats going on in reality, you don&#039;t.<br />And my first few acid trips had really changed my outlook on life and had made me a more mature person and <br />more aware of what&#039;s going on but it doesn&#039;t mean you will have the same effects... soon after they became quite addicting<br />they feel good, you feel like you are more aware and alive than you have been previously but at the end of the day doing them throughout high school has <br />given me REAL consequences, REAL anxieties and REAL, I believe permanent, brain damage even though I get great grades in a top U.S. university (not saying much w/ our current state of education) but you get the point... you are never the same once you&#039;ve tried it, but once you have theres no going back!<br />molly, mushrooms, acid are all too easy to obtain for kids these days and honestly if you have a profound experience there&#039;s going to be no stopping you for a while...<br />we are more curious when we are young and also more naive, so listen to the advice before you and wait until you have a <br />perfect reason to do it, don&#039;t have any anxieties about what is happening in your world and you will find LSD a most beautiful experience :)<br /><br /><br />but then again no one can judge how mature or ready you are for your first trip or out of body experience, I know no one could have changed my mind on trying LSD or mushrooms when I was 15<br />(and definitely wait on DMT till you can honestly appreciate it for all of it&#039;s worth)

				I didn&#039;t start drinking till I was 16, and even then I think it might have been a little early.<br />I do not recommend taking any of the harder drugs until you have a full grasp of your personality: the chemicals you take, the choices you make, and the mind you shake.<br />Taking a psychedelic even once will give a fairly (to very) different outlook on yourself and the world around you. especially LSD and DMT.<br />My advice is to wait until you are out of high school. Along these same lines I cannot in any good faith advice you to smoke weed like a lot of people here have<br />I think that pot means very different things to different people and there are some people who start smoking when its not appropriate and end up falling into the &quot;stoner&quot; lifestyle. but at the same time I know people who smoked pot in high school and are now perfectly productive. its very personal, and has a lot to do with when, how often, and with who you toke. <br />But there is no general right answer, if you are absolutely sure that you have to try something do start light: alcohol / pot before working your way into the more extreme reaches of psychedelics, or hard drugs.

				It isn&#039;t a question of the age, it&#039;s all about your mind.

				I always tend to low-ball dosages when trying new drugs so I&#039;m right there with ya. However, I haven&#039;t done much research into Speed yet (accept for some of the pharm versions) but I imagine I&#039;ll get around to it eventually.<br /><br />Cheers

				I had already smoked pot and cigarettes for three years, blasted massive doses of adderall (80 mg xr was my first dose; I weighed probably 80 pounds), shot ketamine, dropped acid, and ate mushrooms by the time I turned fifteen. Cocaine is excellent; I didn&#039;t give it a chance until I was 18. LSD and DMT are excellent. MDMA might be the perfect recreational drug.

				I started doing drugs at age 12, and by the time I was 15 i had done pretty much every drug, and smoked weed regularly.&nbsp; By age 18 i was a junkie. At the time, i thought there was no such thing as &quot;too young.&quot;&nbsp; But, i&#039;m now 30 years old, and when I look back on it I now know how stupid I was. I have some serious mental issues because my brain hadn&#039;t fully developed. Also, my motivation for school was absolutely destroyed. I did some REALLY stupid stuff.&nbsp; I wish I had waited till i was at least 25.&nbsp; Despite what your friends may tell you, don&#039;t do drugs till you&#039;re at least 18. marijuana IS a gateway drug and it&#039;s a lot more serious than people make it out to be. If you&#039;re at an age where you&#039;re going to have to make important decisions that will affect the rest of your life (12-25) then I think its best to just stay away from drugs. You will lose motivation to achieve anything. <br /><br />I know I probably sound like LE spewing a bunch of &quot;anti-drug propaganda.&quot; But that&#039;s truly what i think.<br /><br />Drugs are bad mmmk.

				Seriously guys? I started at 13.<br /><br />Moderation is key, no reason to be terrified of drugs if you are well versed and cautious.<br /><br />But NO METH! EVER<br /><br />UPDATE: and I absolutely disagree that weed is a gateway drug. If you are smart and strong willed there is nothing to fear. Be confident in your own choices when you feel ready, don&#039;t worry about the assholes.

				In my experience, life is interesting, fun, and kinda good till im 19. Theres not much to worry about and too little responsibility. There must be something wrong somewhere if someone below age of 18-19 taking drugs for reason other than using it as medicine.

				It is a interesting debate about weed being a gateway drug ( and will probably never be agreed upon)<br />One argument I have heard for the legalisation of weed is that it is a gateway drug but only for the fact that it is held by<br />dealers, and therefore access to other drugs become avialable by moving in these circles.<br />I think one main problem ( certainly in the UK ) is the bullshit the government is teaching in schools.<br />Weed is bad - full stop. take E and you die - full stop. etc etc.<br />The first time i tried E I had one of the best nights of my life and upon reflection it made me question everything I had been taught growing up.<br />Honest education is the way forward - probably wont happen though.
