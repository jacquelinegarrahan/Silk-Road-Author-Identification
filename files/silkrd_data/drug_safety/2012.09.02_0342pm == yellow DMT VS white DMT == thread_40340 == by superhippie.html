				Its just the extraction and washing methods of the drug. Different routes use different solvents and have different colors.

				@Snoopish: red and white never made yellow on my color wheel ;). the red of Mimosa-based Jungle-DMT is unrelated to yellow DMT (which can come from many different sources)<br /><br />@34tuforlunch: you are thinking of the red DMT. Which was found to have a mild MAOI in it. and this doesn&#039;t really change anything about the trip other than that it makes it possible to consume the DMT/plant without an MAOI, under certain conditions<br /><br /><br />The truth is, there are several reasons that DMT can be yellow instead of white. the most common reason is from small amounts (&lt;1%) of plant oils that make their way into the end product, because the chemist did not perform a defat during the extraction (usually considered unnecessary with mimosa). <br />The only time you should worry about the yellowness of a DMT is if it is accompanied by any trace of a solvent smell/taste. In this situation, it is typically a sign that the chemist used a impure solvent that doesn&#039;t evaporate cleanly. If you run into anything like this, just say no. Your lungs will thank you.

				People&#039;s concept of yellow/orange is a very broad line with plenty of grey area. Not saying your information isn&#039;t accurate(assuredly it is), but that my information may be a possibility worth considering depending on the tint of the product.<br /><br />Cheers

				From experience my product typically comes out a pure white. I&#039;m only speaking from reading other teks that other output colors are possible. I think you&#039;re right though. It&#039;s more likely to get a lot of red then a little.

				I&#039;ve had the best trip on yellow DMT, but the color doesn&#039;t always represent the purity. <br />I have a friend who purifies his DMT and his ends up white, but began greyish orange.<br />Def a good idea if you do a lot to naptha it up, esp if you have asthma like me because that extra shit will tear up your lungs and feel like your suffocating. I&#039;m aware people without asthma sometimes feel like they are suffocating on DMT, but I actually had an asthma attack on shitty DMT.

				I recently tried DMT for the first time.<br /><br />The batch was a mix of off-white and orange (I think the orange was more from the more compact bits of powder, in other words I think the whole batch was more orange but the powder looked more white due to less compression).<br /><br />I bought from Elvis and was quite happy with the experience, didn&#039;t break through (I still might on what I have left but haven&#039;t had the opportunity to try again) but I think I could have if I would have held that first hit in as long as I could rather than going for a second hit.&nbsp; I started to feel the effects before I&#039;d exhaled completely and honestly, kinda lost track of everything so I have no idea how big the second hit was or how long I held it in for.&nbsp; At some point I forgot I was even holding a bottle full of DMT smoke.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m asking, is there better DMT out there in your guys&#039; experience?&nbsp; Any tips for a first break through?<br /><br />I feel I was close.&nbsp; I&#039;m a small guy (150 lbs or so).&nbsp; And when I let that first hit out I remember saying &#039;holy shit&#039; which is something I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve done since the first time I smoked weed (and thus the first time I ever got high).&nbsp; Do you guys think I could have broken through off one massive hit if I would have held it on for longer?

				I have noticed a few things from pulling my own DMT from Mimosa. I usually do 4-5 pulls on my bark, and freeze precip each pull. The first 2 pulls I always yield white fluffy DMT, as the pulls progress though the DMT yielded has a slight yellow tint and by the fifth pull i am yielding off white yellow DMT. I Recrystalize the later pulls via slow evap to make beautiful, clear sea urchin looking crystals. The yellow I am getting in the initial pulls are plant tannins the the naptha has pulled with it. I get more tannin coloring the longer the naptha has been in the mix. The white fluffy DMT stays in an amber vial in the dark and over a few months with minimal exposure still oxidizes and changes color. The white becomes a tan which eventually fades tan-yellow. The later pulls that arent Re-x&#039;d and start yellow oxidize to a rusty orange over time. I have noticed that the trips can vary slightly based on the color. The clear crystal urchins produce a very clean hit that is easy peasy on the lungs when smoked from the GVG and the trip is very clear and bright, the visuals seemed whitewashed though infinitely present, the tan and yellow produce a much brighter visuals. With the yellow I frequently find the infinite spinning peppermint people and the orange green cog people that seem excited that I&#039;m there.&nbsp; The yellow is the stinkiest of the three varieties I have (wont even get into the red alkaloidal goo). I prefer to smoke the tan as my go-to, the yellow to teach friends with out wasting the white/tan, and admire the clear urchins until there are odd lunar events like blue moons, eclipses.

				edit: i double checked and you can only wash the salt version of dmt in acetone, evidently the freebase form is soluble...<br /><br />you can actually wash the dmt with acetone if it is yellow to remove some of the impurities. its a very simple process that someone recently posted for mdma clean up<br /><br />one of the things about yellow dmt is it could be representative of the age, as it is exposed to oxygen a yellowish oxidative product can be formed which has different bioactivity than unoxidized dmt

				I started a thread asking kind of the same question but I want to know the difference between red (jungle), yellow/orange,and white DMT.I want to know if they cause you to have different trips.I read on several other forums that &quot;jungle spice&quot; is red, but I order &quot;Jungle DMT&quot; from from Elvis.He said that his jungle dmt isn&#039;t red and waxy like most people describe &quot;jungle spice&quot; but rather yellow and orange crystals.So now I don&#039;t know if I should be expecting what people call &quot;jungle spice&quot; the red waxy stuff or if I should just be expecting just DMT but slightly off colored. I asked because I read several people that said they couldn&#039;t get a breakthrough on jungle spice and that it produced a whole list of unpleasant side affects compared to regular white DMT and some even said that it wasn&#039;t even DMT but 5-meo-dmt.If no one has any info I will just have to find out for myself but I was just wondering if I should be expecting a bad trip so I can prepare ahead of time like you would with unpleasant drugs like jimson weed and other deleriants.

				the plants dmt extractions are performed with contain more alkaloids than just n,n-dmt<br /><br />jungle spice usually refers to the extraction of these additional alkaloids, one commonly being 5-meo. generally depending on the extraction method jungle spice does not even contain n,n <br /><br />the color and consistency depends on method, plant, and alkaloid content
