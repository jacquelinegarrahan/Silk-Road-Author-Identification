				Hi all!<br /><br />So I&#039;m normally the one talking all about MDMA and how wonderfully great it is but I have a question I thought I would toss out to the world at large and see if you all have any insight. My girlfriend and I enjoy a nice occasional evening of MDMA induced love-tar-dation but unlike me she often ends up with more jaw clenching and I always feel sort of bad for her the next day because she is clearly more pron to being drained than I am. I&#039;ve done my little bit of homework and try to lower her does a bit (she&#039;s as feindish as me though so think we might have to get a time safe if we ever wanted to do &quot;one little roll&quot;) and we&#039;ve tried a bit of magnesium before the does but she still ends up eating her face off.<br /><br />Clearly it&#039;s not world ending or anything but I do sort of like her and want to try and make sure she has as much fun as she can without as many of the bad sides as possible. So my question really is this, anyone have any real world advice for the clenchies and downies that have worked for them in the past? Besides the magnesium I know 5htp is supposed to rock but there is so much do it then not then and if you do it wrong it sucks sort of stuff I didn&#039;t want to put her on something that was just a waste. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure a few of you have been in the same boat. We&#039;re about a once a month rollers so not terribly worried about the &quot;You&#039;re brain is going to melt&quot; neurotoxic stuff, mostly just want to keep her lovely lips and smile as intact as possible for the day after.<br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />Long Live the Road!

				What kind of magnesium are you taking?&nbsp; It should be magnesium chelate, any other kind is not as bio-available, and you should be taking 500-1000mg.&nbsp; This has reduced jaw clenching in half for me.<br /><br />Do not take 5-HTP with MDMA, it can lead to serotonin syndrome.&nbsp; Taking it after can help with the depression, but eating well, exercise, and getting lots of sleep are just as important to let your body recover.&nbsp; Repeated doses in one night are also much harder on your system and lead to exponentially greater neurotoxicity.&nbsp; If fiending is an issue, take only as much as you plan to do with you, and leave the rest of the drugs in a hard-to-get-to location.&nbsp; Even doing it once a month is pushing it, I would suggest cutting back to once ever 3-4 months.

				I love the feeling of gurning whilst on MDMA, just not the morning after.. <br />Sometimes clenching my fists whilst rolling stops the gurning but then its easier just to gurn rather than to clench your fists lol. Have some Vasaline to put on your lips before and after a roll if you want to protect them.

Will see about some Magnesium Chelate and see if that helps. Never been an issue for me so never worried about it before but it seems to detract from her fun a bit. And yeah, we&#039;ll either cut down on the fiending or space out the rolls a little more in the future.

				Chewing gum works for some people.&nbsp; Also, for me, a beer or cocktail after the come up helps.

				<br />Yes, magnesium chelate pills. I take a 1000mg right before and if I feel it throughout the night I may take an extra 500mg later. Always have gum!!!&nbsp; I use polar ice or some kind of minty fresh gum. <br /><br />I use to chew my tongue and inside of cheeks off before I did the magnesium thing. Now I have zero issues with this. I can enjoy (and taste) a good meal the day after.

				i normally take 1500-2000mg of magnesium&nbsp; on a a festival day of rolling, few in the hour leading up to the festival, and then 1 just b4.<br />and heaps of multivitamins as well, they do ya heaps of good.<br /><br />i normally just make my own caps with mdma, and then fill the rest with crushed up multivitamins and magnesium.<br /><br />after youre down rolling, like at least 3 hours after or before bed, take 5-htp, as well as a few multivitamins, drink heaps of water, and you should wake up feeling pretty good
