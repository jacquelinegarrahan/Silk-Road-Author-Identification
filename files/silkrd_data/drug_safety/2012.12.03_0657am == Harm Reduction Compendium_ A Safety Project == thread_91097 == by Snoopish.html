				Hey SR, Snoopish here! Here&#039;s the shortened version of what&#039;s below: I&#039;m looking for links to posts/threads that provide good information, from the basics to the advanced, about every drug we enjoy to use!<br /><br />Currently I&#039;m smoking up a bit of meth and wanted to see some recommendations for meth pipes (keep looking for a good one locally but not much luck) and stumbled across a good gem of a thread: a very informative and well-written piece on Meth and good habits for someone starting on meth and for continuing on meth. I read it and I wish I knew about some of the things I read about sooner and made me wish I did more research. Here&#039;s the link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6014.msg51631#msg51631<br /><br />That&#039;s the only link I have to contribute right now but I hope other members will keep this alive! I tried doing this with vendors so there&#039;d be a one-stop thread where you could get an idea of the best vendors currently being used but it never took off much.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So here&#039;s what I&#039;d like: everyone who knows of a good, informative thread about benefits, harms, techniques, materials, tips, warnings, everything! A good thread or post about making a lightbulb to smoke meth? Post the link! Got a good guide telling you the taste differences between meth, coke, ket, and common &quot;cuts&quot;? Let&#039;s see it!<br /><br />I would like to have an easy access way to get fundamentals for each drug and it seems so hard to come by. So if there&#039;s something like this out there for meth and other drugs please let me know where it is because I&#039;ve looked and just haven&#039;t had much luck! So much misinformation gets spread around that when I first tried smoking meth I thought it&#039;d recrystallize in&nbsp; your lungs because so many people on drug websites would say ignorant things like that. <br /><br />So here we go. I hope there&#039;s some folks out there that will contribute because otherwise I&#039;m going to have to resort to asking lots of stupid questions one of these days because it&#039;s so time consuming to find reputable information.<br /><br />Links:<br /><br />(Meth)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6014.msg51631#msg51631<br /><br /><br />I hope some of our veteran users will be willing to pitch in on this project (or show me where things like this have been done previously).<br /><br /><br />Cheers!<br />
