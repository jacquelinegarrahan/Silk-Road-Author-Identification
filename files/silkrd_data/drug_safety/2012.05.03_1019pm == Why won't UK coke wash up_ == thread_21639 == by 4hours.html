				Ok, so I&#039;ve tried lots of different coke from various sources. Some of which looks incredible, scaly, shiny oily flake. Great to snort.<br /><br />However, it won&#039;t wash up properly in Ammonia. You get a gloopy oil that doesn&#039;t go hard and sinks to the bottom of the spoon. Takes an age to dry and isn&#039;t really that good a smoke. Causes the heart to beat faster and a feeling of panic.<br /><br />What is this cut? anyone know? Benzocine? Magic?<br /><br />Whatever it is, it seems to be in a lot of UK gear. I dont remember it being this bad last year.<br />

Crack should not be in vogue lol. Why ruin coke when it&#039;s perfectly good as coke, at the most you basing it is acceptable but rocking coke and making it into Crack just ruins a wonderful thing. Well I say wonderful thing but it isn&#039;t because you are in the U.K lol...

				I think I know. Symptoms sound familiar. I don&#039;t want to scare you unnecessarily, but this could be a serious problem, I think it&#039;s a levamisole (it accounts for the speedy sensation) cut in which case you ought to stay the hell away from it unless you can get it washed properly. It&#039;s time to do some serious googling now.<br /><br />Google levamisole and cocaine or go to erowid, there are a lot of good articles on the subject online.<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/cocaine_article2.shtml<br /><br />A lot of the lab tests can&#039;t distinguish between levamisole and cocaine. Dancesafe were working on a kit, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s available.<br /><br />The real problem is that levamisole isn&#039;t being added at the street level, it&#039;s being done right at the origin of the cocaine; the farmers in Columbia. So the entire supply chain is infected. If I were to hazard a guess, I&#039;d say the DEA&#039;s death squads in South America have influenced production either directly or indirectly. The cocaine could be cleaned up in Spain before it reaches the UK, but there&#039;s no incentive to make that happen. <br /><br />There is also the possibility that this is a psy-ops operation, either completely or in part. I have a feeling this is not the case though. There is one way to find out. Get your cocaine tested with one of the new levamisole detection drug kits and see what it says.&nbsp; <br /><br />[Edit: <br /><br />Here is how to make your own detection kit:<br /><br />http://www.levamicoke.info/<br /><br />If this is out of your field of expertise, then pay a lab rat somewhere]<br />

				Oh right. Cheers for the info. I thought levamisole was only added in small amounts. Perhaps someones piling it in UK side.<br /><br />Sometimes I think all these coke dealers care about is money.

				Wow, I&#039;m really glad you posted this. I&#039;ve come across this issue - it was actually my first SR purchase.<br /><br />I did an acid-base extraction and was left with nothing. I must have some good karma, it sounds like some&nbsp; dangerous stuff.<br /><br />It killed DJ AM !!

				A) you wash coke in anhydrous acetone, not ammonia.&nbsp; The gloppy stuff you saw was probably the base itself.&nbsp; If you did not then separate the ammonia/water from the base with diethyl ether, then why would you expect it to be easily smoked?&nbsp; And then after that, you probably also failed to rinse with H2O, making it dangerous as fuck.<br /><br />2) You could have done the SLIGHTEST bit of research on washing coke, as opposed to moving to and from a salt (making smokable freebase). This information can be found in the Cocaine Handbook and there was even a thread on these boards in the last three days.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to &quot;GoogleItForYou&quot; because let&#039;s face it:<br /><br />You are a troll who wants to make folks waste perfectly good cocaine.<br /><br />Very sad....

Serious trolling!<br /><br />Not only will washing cocaine with ammonia basify the cocaine (via deprotonation) but the high level of alkalinity will probably destroy the cocaine.<br /><br />

				Right on Andyki,<br />From what I have experienced and finally learned for myself, 10 to 15 ml clean water to every 0.5 to 1 gram of coke, then drip Ammonia slowly for as long as the precipitation reaction occurs while stirring-- preferably with a copper rod for the most efficient reaction.&nbsp; Then the diethyl ether separation and water wash.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cooks always make it so mysterious, &quot;This is not crack, man. This is Freebase!&quot;&nbsp; There is important chemistry involved, but once understood, it makes logical sense-- not superstition or luck.<br /><br />I think yours is an important point on using as little ammonia as possible in the slow precipitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />DrunkenAfficianado

				Oi, I wasn&#039;t trolling. Why on earth would I do that?<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mean wash as in purify it as you would with acetone. In the uk a lot of people say &#039;wash up&#039; to mean make crack. I was talking about adding cocaine to heated ammonia 10% to make smokable rocks. Its a pretty scummy way of doing it I know.<br /><br />It&#039;s obviously cos UK coke is shite as mentioned and full of benzocaine etc.
