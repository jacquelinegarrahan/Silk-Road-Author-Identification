				planning to honeyflip this weekend. some questions;<br />1. How much 2C-B should be taken? I was planning on taking 140mg of MDMA. Will the MDMA potentiate the 2C-B effect?<br />2. Timing? Before or after?<br />3. Will the MDMA effect be &quot;weakened&quot;/overshadowed by the 2C-B? Even if MDMA is taken 2-3 hours in? (after 2c-b). At least 70% of the reason I&#039;m doing this is because of the MDMA. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t like 2C-B (i love 2c-b), i just love MDMA so much.<br /><br />I see most people recommend taking 2C-B after MDMA. This doesn&#039;t make sense to me. When/after coming down from MDMA I&#039;m usually very tired and &quot;empty&quot;. Barely capable of talking. Taking a psychedelic with that mind sounds like a recipe for an awful trip. How does it work?<br /><br />I&#039;m usually combining MDMA with LSD where I take MDMA after the LSD peak (5 hours after, with usually 5-7 hours left of the trip). This makes sure they don&#039;t crash with each other, and gives me the pleasant effects from LSD (mostly related to senses) while peaking on MDMA.

				ok. i&#039;m convinced.<br /><br />I will take (22mg) 2c-b 90min after the MDMA comeup. Should I skip the MDMA redose (80mg) or can I take it with the 2C-B?<br /><br />Can I fit the MDMA redose somewhere in there, or would it make the experience worse?<br /><br /><br />also; 2C-B is so ridiculously unreliable. I&#039;ve had 2C-B kick in 2 hours after I&#039;ve taken it, sometimes after just 20minutes. It doesn&#039;t matter whether I&#039;ve eaten or not. 2C-B works when it wants to.

				If you do take a booster dose of MD, wait another hour before dropping the 2C-B. <br />The MD seems to mask the early alerts of the 2C-B so it feels like it&#039;s taking longer than usual to come up and you don&#039;t notice the effects until they&#039;re in full force which can take up to 2 hours. Enjoy&nbsp; :D

				2CB and MD is a lovely combination! <br /><br />2CB and Ketamine is a lot better! - was at a freeparty and had the most visual trip of my life. The bottle of Vodka I was holding seemed to grow 100 ft tall before I realised that I can copy and paste sections of the sky as if i was in MS paint or something! Absolutely smashing time!!!&nbsp; :D
