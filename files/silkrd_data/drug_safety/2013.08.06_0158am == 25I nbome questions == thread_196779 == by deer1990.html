				Pwnedurmoma1, educate yourself. 25i is not orally active because it is destroyed by stomach acid!<br /><br />1mg is a good dose so if you&#039;re new to psychedelics, you might want to do half a tab, wait an hour and do the other half if you think you can handle it. Just put it on your gums somewhere and try swallowing as little saliva as possible. Also, moving the tab to a different spot every few minutes might help. It should take about 20-30 minutes for all of the 25i to be absorbed.

				An important thing to mention is that it doesn&#039;t matter where you put it within your mouth, as much as it does matter that you don&#039;t swallow anything. Once it&#039;s in your mouth and your saliva is melting it off the tab, you don&#039;t wanna swallow anything.

				To achieve the full effect of 25I, you need to keep the tab and ALL of you saliva in your mouth for over 30minutes.&nbsp; The effects will increase up to about an hour of sublingual administration.<br /><br />Beware tho, 1g of 25I taken properly can be stronger then most reports would indicate.&nbsp; Many people swallow their saliva, or keep the tab in their mouth for only 20mins or so, and so see significantly diminished effects.<br /><br />That said, I think 25I at 1000mg will be a fairly tolerable experience for most people.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit of a long trip tho, so better to start with mushrooms.
