				Cubensis.&nbsp; Any variety.&nbsp; 2.5-3.5 grams dry weight.&nbsp; I like to steep them in lemon tea myself.<br /><br />Master Cubes, then go onto Panaelous and Azurescens.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those two are direct links to God.

				Start eating 1-2 grams dried maybe 1.5, see where that takes u then take more as needed.<br />Loadsa shit u can do with shrooms; tea, mix them with chocolate. Look up shroom recipes on google because they taste like shit.

				2.5-3.5 grams dry.&nbsp; Don&#039;t bother with less unless your tiny.&nbsp; It&#039;ll just be a disapointment and won&#039;t bring you anywhere close to the places you can go.

				Check out Shroomeister&#039;s caps (his link is in the list in my sig)--respected vendor, good and easy-to-eat product. I tried his caps one evening (2g worth so 4 easy to swallow caps). After about 30ish minutes I had some of the most amazing experiences in my life over the next several hours. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t had anybody else&#039;s shroom product and frankly don&#039;t see a need. A shroom is a shroom (once dried--getting fresh won&#039;t happen here though). Go get some caps and have a blast. Shrooms are fun to experiment with. Just don&#039;t be scared and trust the experience.<br /><br />Cheers
