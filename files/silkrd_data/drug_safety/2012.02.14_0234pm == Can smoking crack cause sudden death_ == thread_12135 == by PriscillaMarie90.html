				I think you can die from almost any synthesised drug, we never know what is in it and how we react to it.&nbsp; A big argument for legalising all drugs, because then ingredients will be on side of packet like weeties.&nbsp; &nbsp;When taking drugs I always have a safety net, if by self, I have a few good friends I can ring (also users), who will come around or at least ring regularly.&nbsp; If cant contact, no matter how bad I look I get out in public, so if I really need help someone will help eventually.&nbsp; I have never felt bad enough to go to hospital but wouldn&#039;t hestitate.&nbsp; Doctors never hand users over to police, just lecture you (my ex-girlfriend had this happen several times), and if they think it was a suicide attempt will make sure you stay offernight and go to at least one conselling session.

				If you need a breakdown of the complete pharmacokinetics, then you also lack the knowledge to understand the process.&nbsp; Take their word for it.&nbsp; As far as lethal doses, there are several complicating factors, polypharmacy and drug interactions not being the least of them.&nbsp; Formation of ethylbenzoylecgonine, or cocaethylene (later metabolized to benzoylecgonine) from ingesting ethanol along with cocaine increases lethality and the risk of seizure events greatly.&nbsp; It also has a longer half-life and lower LD50.&nbsp; The multiplicity of physiologic and pharmacologic modifiers which may act upon cocaine and its metabolites in your body contributes to the widely varying lethal doses, which range from as low as 20 mg IV, to a mean of 500 mg ingested orally, to 1.4 g.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not a physician, or another highly trained professional, it is impossible to assess the safety of cocaine use predictably, which is really why it is illegal.&nbsp; It was widely accepted at one time, but frequent fatalities made its abundance a hazard to the uneducated public.&nbsp; You can take steps to reduce risk however, like not being a dumbass and drinking while using coke, and not shooting up, or smoking crack.&nbsp; Personally, I would stick to insufflation, and periodically analyze samples from whomever is providing your cocaine.<br /><br />If the high isn&#039;t good enough, maybe the drug isn&#039;t the problem...&nbsp; More isn&#039;t always better.&nbsp; Use drugs in conjunction with practical problem solving and coping skills, and you&#039;ll live longer.

				I wouldn&#039;t think crack could kill a perfectly health individual by smoking it once. There might be some potential for death if you had some kind of heart condition.

				@nerf-<br />Naw, I haven&#039;t tried smoking crack yet! Thinking about it, but I don&#039;t know if I want to. That&#039;s good to hear that you haven&#039;t died from it though!<br /><br />@yaosh-<br />Thank you for your input.

There was a famous basketball player in the 80&#039;s that died this way and fueled the drug war even more. It was an anomaly though and is a rare occurrence. try it and you will see it is a waste of time with a 4x longer comedown then high.

				fyi, leva/dexamisole has been consistently found in coke samples over the last 4-5 years. It is NOT a new phenomenon.<br />Nor is there any acute toxicity involved. The harm is done when people (ab)use chronically.<br />It has been shown recently that leva/dexamisole metabolises to aminorex. That - in combination with coke - is the real killer here.<br /><br />And yes, occasionally people die from one-time-cocaine use. Both snorting and smoking. Some people also die after taking aspirin for the first time. Or eat nuts.<br />Of course, the risk with crack is A LOT higher. Nerf, you lost your vision for a few hours? I hope you know what that means...<br />IMO, with crack, there is no such thing as &quot;one time use&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Healthy&quot; users insufflating coke can develop a habit, but still remain functional and healthy.<br />Smoked coke users have a tendency to deteriorate very rapidly. The reinforcing effect of smoked coke is sooo fuckin&#039; strong. Of course, the high is on the same level *sigh*. In my experience, when you have a &quot;batch&quot; of crack lying around and you start smoking, you don&#039;t stop until it&#039;s all gone.<br /><br />Just be careful. I think smoked coke (base, crack) is easily the most destructive (mentally, physically, socially, etc...) and addictive substance out there. Smoked meth should be a good second I guess, don&#039;t know, don&#039;t wanna know frankly.<br /><br />Just... be careful :-)

				Meth and heroin are definitely worse, although I don&#039;t know much about crack I do know with cocaine a line should really only be about 75 milligrams although I don&#039;t know what amount with crack is but I guess it should be about the same.<br /><br />Maybe even use half of 75mg if it&#039;s your first time it&#039;s like me when I try LSD I might not even take a full tab to start off with as you got to be in control.

Supposedly he either snorted WAY to much high-grade cocaine or he snorted actual crack (I think latter was case).<br /><br />Never done the rock myself and not about to start. But is it possible? Yes. Is it likely if you are smart about using? No.<br /><br />You can also die from drinking too much water, so its all about responsible dosing.

				i think whoever said that smoking crack one time can kill was mainly refferring to people who have preexisting medical condidtions that are affected by cocaine or stimulants in general. if yor gona try it start small like a 5$ peice or even less then go from there.. i prefer smoking it rather than snorting coke myself.. but all depends the mood.. be prepared to window peep :) takes a long time to refrain form that..
