				I&#039;m interested in trying out some Chems.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a lot of experience with MDMA, some with LSD, and a few times with Shrooms. <br /><br />I do have some issues with anxiety that tends to flare up from time to time with LSD/Shrooms.<br /><br />What would be something good to start out with? I&#039;ve been reading up with on the 2C&#039;s, and I think 2C-I might be the one to start with.<br /><br />Enlighten me, friends. :D

				Haven&#039;t tried too many of the RC&#039;s... for a starter though I&#039;d recommend 800-1000ug 25c-NBOMe buccal... that will take you to a really nice visual space and light on the mind and body (and good price too)... Good for watching TV, walking the neighborhood, school/college assignements, almost anything (even just watching the walls breath and carpet melt).<br /><br />from the 2c&#039;s I like the idea of 2C-B but not tried it yet... that would be my first 2C before 2C-I I think.

				I cannot recommend 4-aco-DMT enough if you&#039;re looking to wet your feet in RC&#039;s -- it&#039;s all the good parts of mushrooms without the side effects (it metabolizes in your body as psilocin, a highly unstable chemical found only in freshly picked shrooms). If you&#039;re looking to try out the 2c-x family I would recommend starting out with 2c-b -- it&#039;s shorter lasting and less physically intense than it&#039;s relatives. 2c-e is wonderful, and can be a powerfully insightful trip, but be careful how much you take (it has a really steep dose-response curve - a couple mg too many can drastically increase the effects) and take a benadryl with it to relieve the over-stimulation (a common side effect).<br /><br />A couple favorite RC&#039;s of mine:<br />4-aco-DMT <br />2c-b<br />2c-e<br />2c-c<br />MXE (a dissociative, not a psychedelic)<br />6-APB<br />DIPT (most unique drug I&#039;ve ever taken - 24 hours of almost exclusively auditory hallucination/distortion)<br />2c-t-7<br />methylone/mephedrone (empathogens/stimulants; similar to MDMA)<br /><br />A few I&#039;ve taken but disliked (wouldn&#039;t personally recommend):<br />MDPV<br />4-MEC<br />5-meo-DALT<br />2c-i (most people do like this, I&#039;ve just never been a fan)<br />2c-t-2<br />DOB<br /><br />Everyone has different experiences, though, so don&#039;t rule any of these out. Just do your research before taking any new RC, and be absolutely sure you trust your source.

				2c-i is a good one to start with.&nbsp; Personally I kind of find it to be similar to 2c-b but not quite as good, but I do have a few friends who swear by 2c-i.<br /><br />For a more light mellow trip 2c-c and 2c-d are great.&nbsp; Not really much to worry about in terms of anxiety.<br /><br /><br />As already mentioned 4-aco-dmt is a really nice one.&nbsp; I enjoy mushrooms more (chemically they are very similar - psilocin is 4-ho-dmt) and get a smoother trip from them, but it seems to be the opposite for most people.<br /><br /><br />If anxiety is an issue at all I would definitely not recommend 2c-e.&nbsp; It can be a pretty overbearing trip that is hard to control.<br /><br /><br />OH, and 2c-t-2 is a great one.&nbsp; Very similar to mescaline.&nbsp; There&#039;s a good chance you will get some nausea on the comeup, but it passes pretty quick and the rest of the trip is fantastic.
