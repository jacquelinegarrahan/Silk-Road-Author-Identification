				I have only done crystal meth one time in my life. It just so happened I was opiate dependent at the time, and I hadn&#039;t used heroin in almost a day when I tried it. I was reaching that crazy point where I felt like I just had to do SOMETHING, and meth was what came up, so I did it.<br /><br />I was smoking with someone much more experienced than myself, so he handled holding the stem and lighting, telling me when to inhale, etc. It is fuzzy now to me how much I actually smoked, but I took a couple of hits and then felt this superhuman awesome feeling in my chest for a couple of seconds and thought, &quot;Damn, this is going to be fun.&quot; <br />That was a very short-lived thought. <br /><br />A few minutes&nbsp; later, I got this horrible sharp pain in the lower right side of the back of my head/neck. I started having muscle spasms there. The pain shot up through my head and pulsed, turning into an awful headache. I broke out in sweats, ended up vomiting, and was sick all night. The guy I was with tried to massage my head and neck, which helped ever so slightly. He also gave me a beta blocker, and said it should help. It didn&#039;t. I was sick as fuck, puking until it was just bile, then dry heaving.<br /><br />The sweats and throwing up lasted probably almost 48 hours, despite getting some heroin in my system the next day. The headache lasted for, I shit you not, at LEAST a month. I woke up every morning with some degree of what I can only compare to a severe migraine. There continued to be what felt like a knotted muscle in the area where the pain originated. Every time I even thought about the smell/taste of the crystal (it smelled kind of sweet and citrus-y) my mouth started to sweat, like I was about to throw up again.<br /><br />Two days later I ended up going to a detox and getting off of dope, but I&#039;m left wondering, what the hell happened with that meth?<br />Maybe crystal and I just don&#039;t mix, maybe it was the heroin w/d, maybe I overdosed? These are the only ideas I can come up with.<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				The muscle spasm could have made you panic and triggered some other symptoms.<br /><br />The sweating and nausea sounds like either opiate withdrawal or a panic attack.<br /><br />The headache could just be a migraine. Migraines comeback repeatedly and are sensitive to the slightest things. They also can last hours. Or maybe the meth gave you a somatic disorder that makes you think that you&#039;re having migraines. (Armchair psychiatry...)

				No idea, maybe you smoked too much?<br />I&#039;ve never gotten anything bad like that when i&#039;ve smoked, although i&#039;ve only smoked a few times now, like 5-6...<br />i never got nauseous or anything, heh last time i smoked i had a bit of chest pain, but i smoked more than i ever had before at once (about a quarter gramish in 40 minutes about, of decent shards....), and i was just really high, and wasn&#039;t bothered by the chest pain, i get that sometimes on high doses of pharm speed too....i&#039;ve had headaches on speed but they&#039;re IME not related to dose or anything, and headaches have only happened to me when i&#039;ve used pharms (and only a few times in 3 years of use of pharms have i gotten a headache while high-but the few times i have, its a bad headache...)

I don&#039;t know for sure, but I would assume methamphetamine could certainly make the symptoms of opiate withdrawal more severe. Meth is kind of like taking a shit on your heart anyway, so in conjunction with heroin, I bet your body may have just had enough.

				i don&#039;t know much about H but i been around the speed. never been around anyone that has had this sort of episode. an allergic reaction shouldn&#039;t last a month. <br />IMHO i think the speed kick-started the withdrawal symptoms... but im not a dr and i have no clue what im talking about.. someone in this position should not use meth but rather seek professional help.

				I know this thread is dead, but in case any of you pass on by with curiosity I figured I&#039;d chime in - <br /><br />I was addicted to heroin for four years, and any time I went through withdrawal and did meth it actually made the withdrawal go away, until I ran out of meth. After I ran out, however, it would be the worst fucking thing. Usually while I was doing the meth I would have the persistence to find some H or a good substitute. <br /><br />As far as what you described happening to you, if what you smoked was powder (not all meth is crystal, even after it is done cooking) it&nbsp; may have had a lot of impurities in it from the cooking process. The symptoms you described sound like it had a lot of lithium left in it, and it probably didn&#039;t have the ph balanced. Your friend didn&#039;t get any of these symptoms on account of his using it often - chances are he got it from a person he scores from regularly, meaning that the method of cooking and therefore the product is always the same. Your body can build up a tolerance to lithium, and some of the other poisons that remain in meth that hasn&#039;t been cooked properly. <br /><br />I have a lot of experience with good meth, and bad meth. Too much bad meth around these parts now, which is why I haven&#039;t done any in two years. Monday is fast approaching (not fast enough.....) and I have an order for some coming in from VroomVroom (who is the man, by the way). <br /><br />I suggest trying it again if you want, but only if you think you can control it to a respectful degree, and only if you get quality stuff from a vendor on here. <br /><br />- Eco

				O.P, here&#039;s my take (you pretty much answered your own question):<br /><br />Opiate Withdrawal --&gt; evoke fight/flight response (among a physiological clusterfuck of symptoms).<br />Meth --&gt; massive flood of dopamine, norepinephrine (evokes fight/flight) and serotonin. <br />You poured gas directly on the small, but present fire so to speak, and it induced and/or exacerbated acute withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, if it was shitty meth, then you were pouring&nbsp; jet fuel on that fire! <br /><br />What you experienced sounds horrific.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />In the past I&#039;ve made the mistake of taking an Adderall during very minor opiate withdrawal, also thinking the amp would brighten things up a bit. Instead it amplified the w/d symptoms and made for more miserable day. <br />

				I have never tried Meth or H, but I have definitely gotten similar &quot;headaches&quot; along with some of the other symptoms, and so have some of my friends.<br /><br />They usually begin at the base of the neck and seem to involve the trapezius, scalenes, scm, and a few other small muscles of the neck/back. Sometimes they come on suddenly while other times it seems to be precipitated by repetitive stress to the area (excessive computer use with bad posture, lifting things in front of the body too much, etc.). <br /><br />When it comes out of nowhere, the pain is much worse and it does not go away until, just as suddenly, you get the urge to vomit and puke your guts out. Also, your blood pressure will be very high until this point. After that, the pain gradually subsides and you get better. Opiates, massage, etc does not work. This seems very similar to what you experienced, and I find that we get these headaches after being sleep deprived or perhaps eating too much shit food (or both!). One time my friend and I each took a 2mg bar and BOTH had the same migraine the following morning! It only lasted for a couple hours, but it was fucking hell. Almost intolerable pain, insane anxiety, half-dreams repeating themselves over in your head, high BP, and then the sudden nausea and projectile vomiting. Crazy shit... We were both deprived of sleep before taking the bars, and even though we both technically &quot;slept&quot;, benzos are known to suppress REM sleep (plus we had a low tolerance), so it&#039;s possible that we didn&#039;t get any meaningful rest despite sleeping for about 6 hours before the headaches started. I should also add that we ate tons of junk food and sugar while high on the bars, so perhaps blood sugar levels were involved.<br /><br />Now when these headaches or whatever come on gradually, it still hurts like hell but the pain is manageable and will go away if you hit the right trigger points with a deep tissue massage. If that doesn&#039;t work, a 7.5mg Vicodin takes care of it for me. In addition to the muscles I mentioned above, try massaging your external rotator cuff (muscles covering the back of your shoulder blade -- jut your shoulder forward and reach behind the armpit with your other arm to find these). Treating that area kills the entire headache within 2 minutes like 50% of the time for some reason, probably due to an injury. You can also try hitting a trigger point in your lower traps -- the area where your trapezius muscle meets the spine midway down your back (google &quot;lower traps&quot;). Rub the area against a sharp corner somewhere until the whole muscle relaxes. I shit you not, this also works about 1/3rd of the time for any headache or pain involving the traps, especially if you use the computer a lot.
