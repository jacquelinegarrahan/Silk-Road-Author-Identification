				Well, it does that to me (hearing the pulse thing) but only if I smoke a LOT of weed (and it&#039;s not a pleasurable feeling). Happened to me also once on brownies, when I puked my stomach out for 3 hours straight :/

				ive never heard my pulse when high on weed :( but i have had crazy closed eye hallucinations in the past... now my tolerance is too high to get there and not feel shit about wasting a days worth of weed for two hours lol<br /><br />i always get a ringing in my ears from synthetics though... so I think it&#039;s possible on weed too

				If you take a snapper rip out of a bong with some good weed you will go a little deaf, forehead will sweat, and get a head rush and be so stoned.

				yes it increases your heartbeat some and makes your hearing sharper so that is likely the cause.

				This sometimes happens to me when I smoke a lot of duub or some good duub.<br /><br />Try to calm yourself down and to relax. <br />Focus on your breathing, take long deep breaths, in through the nose, out the mouth.<br />Focus on your heartbeat/pulse and try to slow it down by further relaxing.<br /><br />It takes some practice but I can &quot;calm&quot; myself down quite easily these days.

				If you think or focus on your heart too much, it will affect the beats per minute or cause you to notice it more.&nbsp; Weed from a pharmacological standpoint can change the way you think, it is a powerful drug.&nbsp; My paranoid friend gets this everytime he dabs with me, sometimes he even thinks he&#039;s having a heart attack and the oxygen in the air has disappeared but if I change the topic or ask if he wants me to make him food he is fucking fine as a bat.

				There are two possible answers.<br /><br />1. You&#039;re just being paranoid and are noticing things you usually wouldn&#039;t, such as your pulse. This usually will happen when it&#039;s quiet and you&#039;re stoned.<br /><br />2. You could be having heart palpitations, which are unusually strong heart beats. <br /><br />More than likely, since you&#039;re only hearing your pulse the possibility of a palpitation is low. However, if you FEEL your heart is pounding, racing, ect, and you aren&#039;t doing much physical activity, then that becomes a problem. Next time you smoke, check your heart rate. If it&#039;s unusually high and you&#039;re not doing anything besides sitting on the couch, then do your best to take it easy until you are sober. It would REALLY be recommended to see your doctor just to make sure everything is okay. You don&#039;t have to worry about them telling the cops you smoke cannabis, so you don&#039;t have to lie to him/her.<br /><br />sdesu

				^^Right just like you never had sexual relations with that woman&nbsp; ;)<br />But yeah this happens to me sometimes but I realized it only does it after I get up and do something that actually requires at least a little energy for example after I smoke like a blunt to myself and then take my dog for a walk if I sit down after taking him for a walk I can feel my heart beat and I can hear it.I think its mostly because of your heightened awareness.Because its only after I do a physical activity so my heart actually is beating a little harder than it would be at rest and I just notice it more because I&#039;m faded. But maybe not? Thats just what I always figured it was.
