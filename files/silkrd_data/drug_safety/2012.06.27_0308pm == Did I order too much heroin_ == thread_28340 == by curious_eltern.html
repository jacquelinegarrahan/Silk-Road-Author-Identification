				I ordered a gram of #3 from c63amg<br /><br />Upon further investigation/reading on Erowid that the dosage for snorting it should be between 10-50mg<br /><br />This means that I ordered anywhere from 20 to 100 doses.<br /><br />Did I really go that overboard? <br /><br />No &#039;send it to me&#039; comment please - genuinely curious.

				i bought a quarter gram of #4 for my first time and that lasted me a few months. just be careful mate, someone on here has vanished recently after trying H for the first time, and he had #3.

				I&#039;m in my late 20&#039;s and tried H a few times about 8 years ago. Only snorting it. I remember I bought 5 &#039;bags&#039; or whatever they were called and it lasted me like 3 days.<br /><br />When I was a teen I was balls to the wall into drugs, but mostly drinking, coke, and ecstasy. I could go through an 8ball of coke in a day or two.<br /><br />But that was a long time ago and I know H is different.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading through that post before you linked it and that&#039;s what is putting me off.

				@curiouse dont worry man youll be fine. 1 gram of #3 isnt going to be that much as its probably only 40-50% pure at best. The dosage your reading on erowid of 10-50mg is reffering to 70-90% pure #4. Even with no tolerance youll probably still need to use between 80-150mg probably more. So you really only have about 10 doses there really if your snorting. Dont take my word for it ALWAYS start small and work your way up to judge the strength... small lines every 10 minutes until you get where you want to be.

				I was wondering about that. <br /><br />Since I can remember I&#039;ve always been using Erowid for learning about drugs so I give the website a lot of trust, but I last time I did H I certainly snorted more than 10mgs.<br /><br />Still feeling a bit sketched out about ordering it after reading all the posts.

				Getting 40 out of a gram is not that crazy really.<br /><br />If you have no experience with opiates, 10 mg of heroin can certainly produce a noticeable effect. Perhaps even smaller doses could work - people commonly respond to 10 to 20 mg doses of morphine in a hospital setting, and with the relative potencies of these drugs that suggests heroin could have effects at the few milligram level already.

It&#039;s insidious stuff if you have a liking for it.<br /><br />And like everyone says start small until you know how strong the stuff is, snorting a match head sized amount is a good starting point and give it 1/2 hour between bumps till you get the measure of the stuff.

				Not to get all holier than thou, but why mess with heroin if you are worried about addiction?&nbsp; There are so many other drugs you can get on SR that are enjoyable and don&#039;t have the addiction potential.&nbsp; 2C-B comes to mind as one example of many.&nbsp; Again, not trying to be holier than thou.&nbsp; I&#039;m a drug user too.

				House, asking some other person to do some and then tell you how much to do is just asking for trouble.&nbsp; They could say it was shit and tell him 100mg is a good starting dose, which if he has no tolerance would be enough to make him overdose.<br /><br />Fortunately the starting dose for people without any opiate tolerance is fairly well know by now.&nbsp; As most of the users have already indicated, start with a line of about 10mg the first time, wait at least 30-60 minutes after the first hit before even trying a second dose and don&#039;t go chasing the rush for the next 4-5 hours doing 200-300mg as it will accumulate and more than likely put the person into at least a mild overdose with headaches and vomiting.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing it for years and even with a high tolerance I never do more than 50mg on the first hit of a new batch until I am sure how strongly it will effect me.<br /><br />Now, the bit about becoming addicted after doing only one gram.&nbsp; If you go and do the entire gram over the course of a couple of days, yes, your body is quite likely to show its displeasure when you stop.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be as bad as if you had been doing several grams over the course of a week, but you will notice it.&nbsp; Be prepared for flu like symptoms, the better the H, the worse the WD&#039;s will be.&nbsp; But it shouldn&#039;t last too long, possibly a day or so to get over the worst (although everybody is different and it could be less or it could be more).<br /><br />If you spread it out over several weeks you should be fine, your body won&#039;t ever have enough in its system for it to start noticing its absence.<br />

				Thanks for all the comments.<br /><br />Well, it arrived on Friday (very fast with C63amg to EU).<br /><br />Just got around to trying it today. Did the smallest of bumps about 30 minutes ago and barely feel anything, so I&#039;ll repeat the same dose. <br /><br /><br />A gram is really a shit ton of powder given the potency of the stuff. I just thought &quot;coke&quot; when I was ordering the gram before looking on Erowid for dosage.

				Update:<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve been giving it the ole&#039; college try and trying to power through this gram. I&#039;m probably about 60% through the bag.<br /><br />This really hasn&#039;t been doing much for me.

				I have also had my first H a few days ago. I ordered 0,5g from c63amg and went through it in 2 days without feeling any effects. Maybe just slight relaxation but that is all. I too have been waking up during the night...strange...makes me think what kind of crap we got...I am never ordering from c63 again and I think he is bullshitting new buyers and sends them low-quality product. Just my opinion.<br /><br />@ muslix: The numbers indicate various forms of heroin.<br />Heroin #1: Morphine Freebase or Morphine HCL<br />Heroin #2: Heroin Acetate or Heroin Freebase<br />Heroin #3: #4 heroin but specifically altered at the POM (Point of Manufacture) to make it conducive for smoking. The technical definition is a 60:40 mix, with 60 representing heroin hcl. and 40 representing caffeine hcl.<br />Heroin #4: Heroin hcl made specifically for injection.

				#3 is for smoking or spiking. Not half as potent if snorted. #4 destroys you snorted so I imagine it totally fucks you up if smoked or jabbed. <br /><br />Only done #4 myself, but I got this info from other stuff I&#039;ve read here. a small bump (&lt;10 mg) of #4 up the hooter fucking annihilated me. It&#039;s too nice.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you didn&#039;t like it mate, it nearly wrote my life off from doing a ridiculously small amount.

				You can definitely do it, but you have to be careful. I&#039;ve never had problems when I didn&#039;t have heroin around, and actually have never experienced any withdrawal symptoms, but when I have it I tend to take it habitually.<br /><br />My first batch of heroin was a half gram, and I got it to last me almost 6 months between being snorted and smoked (snorting was more effective, but I wanted to try both). I see you didn&#039;t enjoy it at first, but I honestly didn&#039;t enjoy mine at first, either. In a way, it&#039;s an acquired taste (in my opinion) in the same way that coffee is.<br /><br />Now when I get it, I typically only smoke it. My tolerance can sky-rocket very quickly, unfortunately. As an example, having not taken any heroin in in about a month and a half, I bought another 2 grams of it not too long ago. I managed to smoke all of it in the course of 4 days, with my tolerance building up to 175mg dosages by the end of the 4th day. That was about a week ago, and while I&#039;ll probably want to take some again sometime, I experienced no problems afterwards and don&#039;t have a desire to buy another batch with any immediacy.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest that you make every effort to only take single dosages at a time. If you don&#039;t feel like you got high enough, that&#039;s fine, you can try a larger dose again in a few days. If you think that you&#039;re starting to develop a problem with it, just throw it out then. I don&#039;t know how many people can handle heroin as easily as I can, but I wouldn&#039;t count on it.

				Hi, the best way with no.3 is to smoke it on tinfoil. Snorting it works but I have seen someone OD from snorting lines too quick. Cos it hits you more or less instantly smoking you&#039;re more likely to nod out before getting to OD stage.<br />Get a sheet of foil about postcard size . Burn it both sides with a lighter to get rid of any coating. Get another piece and make a tube.( fold in edges to make rectangle then if you like fold in like start of paper plane) before rolling round a pen into a tube shape. The pointy style is alleged to collect more residue but learned opinion varies.<br /><br />Place maybe 1/4 g on foil, after bending it so as to form a valley(don&#039;t crease). Hold lighter underneath powder and tilt foil slightly, it will melt to treacle like fluid. Chase it with lighter beneath foil. Suck hard through tube as you do this inhaling vapour. Don&#039;t overdo the heat.<br /><br />Theres a bit of a knack to this ( like injecting one handed !) so if you prefer you can &#039;spot&#039; much smaller doses: just hold the lighter underneath till its all burnt up. Again be careful because if you do way too much this way you can OD.<br /><br />I would disagree with the poster who says little doses over a few weeks is less likely to cause problems than hammering it all in a weekend. I&#039;d say the opposite.<br /><br />I have been&nbsp; using opiates for nearly 20 years now. Started like you just trying it, for maybe five or six years it was just an occasional treat. Then certain events in my life caused a severe depression and I turned to smack for solace. I was an IV addict for masybe six years, more recently I gained some control and for a few years would have the odd binge every couple weeks, dealing with withdrawals inbetweeen by methadone and codeine and benzos. I was a functional drug addict, if you know what I mean. Worked&nbsp; several jobs throughout. The last five years I have been on subutex which effectively makes it very difficult to get high as it blocks other opiates totally for 3-4 days after a dose. I take it daily to prevent returning to my old ways. I have 2 small children who I love more than anything. I live with their mother and them now and my old life seems like a bad dream. My younger brother died about 4 years ago as a result of alcohol choking in sleep and this obviously made me reconsider a lot iof choices I had made. (he liked a lot of drugs too although not so much H)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I am trying to say that those rat like human skeletons you see walking too fast in pairs to phone booths all started like you: thinking &quot; well I&#039;ll just give it a try, obviously I won&#039;t get addicted! I&#039;m not that stupid&quot;<br />You don&#039;t wake up one day and think &quot;I think I&#039;m gonna be a junky&quot;<br />It creeps insidiously up on you in your blind spot.<br />Once a month treat becomes every two weeks becomes a long weekend but hey I&#039;m not addicted cos I stopped for four day. Then one day you wake up feeling this intense discomfort and you think &quot; right. Obviously I have a problem.... But I cant think straight feeling like this. Let&#039;s just get a bag of gear to get through the next couple of days then I&#039;ll take some time off and go cold turkey&quot; just one more day.<br /><br />Anyway... er.... that&#039;s how you smoke heroin....sorry about rant! Be careful mate because once you know it&#039;s there, even if you don&#039;t think you like it at first.<br />You&#039;ll think &quot; well maybe I got a bad batch....I&#039;ll give it one more try... just to see....&quot;<br /><br />Since discovering SR I have made a couple of attempts to get high; but by the time the subutex wears off I have caned most of it leaving me with a weak buzz and intense shame and self disgust making me glad to put basck on the subutex handcuffs. Most people I know have no idea about my past. It&#039;s fucking weird. Your probably thinking &quot;if he loves his kids so much why would he still want to take heroin?&quot; I dont know. <br />

				I know. I know. Talk about a buzz kill. On the plus side it is an extremely pleasant drug, and it won&#039;t turn you into an obnoxious loudmouth like cocaine. And in fairness I have known a couple of people who were able to have the odd bit of brown without ever getting seriously hooked. Mostly people with wealthy supportive families and plenty of options.<br />Also a lot of my friends who got habits to one extent or another have recovered again to varying degrees.<br /><br />And it is a fucking nice drug. You see I can&#039;t bring myself to totally bad mouth it even now!

I ordered 0,5g from c63amg and went through it in 2 days without feeling any effects. Maybe just slight relaxation but that is all. I too have been waking up during the night...strange...makes me think what kind of crap we got...I am never ordering from c63 again and I think he is bullshitting new buyers and sends them low-quality product. Just my opinion.<br /><br />@ muslix: The numbers indicate various forms of heroin.<br />Heroin #1: Morphine Freebase or Morphine HCL<br />Heroin #2: Heroin Acetate or Heroin Freebase<br />Heroin #3: #4 heroin but specifically altered at the POM (Point of Manufacture) to make it conducive for smoking. The technical definition is a 60:40 mix, with 60 representing heroin hcl. and 40 representing caffeine hcl.<br />Heroin #4: Heroin hcl made specifically for injection.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I also wake up many times a night with c63&#039;s gear... weird.<br /><br />And I thought that #3 was freebase heroin, mixed with caffeine to help it smoke, whereas #4 has been processed into the salt. That&#039;s why you need to acidify #3 to get it to dissolve, whereas #4 doesn&#039;t need acid.<br /><br />Maybe there was some international symposium where all the heroin producers agreed to this 60:40 ratio with caffeine for #3... ;) <br /><br />What&#039;s your source on that info?

				Either way, I never really liked downers. Hell, I used to smoke weed all the time, but after a point I started getting lots of panic attacks. Now it happens every time I smoke so I don&#039;t anymore. I suspect it is some cross interaction from all the psychedelics I did in my teens.<br /><br />Will continue to stick to ecstasy or MDA once or twice a month and coke a few times a year. And of course drinking!

				I would set aside around .1-.2g for use then just try snorting a matchhead sized bump. Give it like half an hour for you to get a feel for the effects if any and take another bump if necessary! Then when you start nodding a lot, hide the other ~.8g and you won&#039;t be able to find it! You could also get super super tiny plastic baggies that are like .5x.5 inch that are hella cute and split it up into 10 baggies and hide it in different places! You def won&#039;t be able to find quite a few of the baggies! And then, you&#039;ll randomly find a small baggy of bliss every now and then! Losing drugs is the best way to control drug use IMO :3
