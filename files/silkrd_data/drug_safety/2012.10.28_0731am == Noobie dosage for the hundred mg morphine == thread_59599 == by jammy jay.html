				I think you should get rid of it, don&#039;t take it, that is way too much.&nbsp; Get a hydrocodone 5/325 or a percocet 5/325 instead.&nbsp; 100mg is way too much for a newbie, even if you took 1/4 of it you would be taking way too much.&nbsp; &nbsp;They make a 15mg Morphine Sulphate pill, that would probably be safer, maybe if you took half.&nbsp; 100mg is really meant for chronic pain and cancer patients who have developed a tolerance to opiates over a period of time.&nbsp; They make only one strength higher than 100mg and that is 200mg.<br /><br />Morphine is one of the pills that is good for pain control when taken orally, but not very euphoric.&nbsp; You should go with 5-10 mg of hydrocodone or oxycodone instead.&nbsp; Or better yet, just avoid opiates altogether.&nbsp; They are a really nasty drug to have to detox from, and that is why people will pay crazy prices to keep from having to go through withdrawals.&nbsp; It turns into a really expensive habit in a really short amount of time.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents.

				If it&#039;s MS Contin - a continuous release product - then the 100mg won&#039;t all be released at once, and will instead be meted out over time. That said, 100mg of continuous release morphine is far too much for somebody who doesn&#039;t have a decent opiate tolerance. At best you&#039;ll be semiconscious and at worst you might require hospitalisation.<br /><br />A safe but effective level of effect can be achieved by using a sharp knife to split the pill into two equal halves, and then split one of the halves into halves. You can then consume one of the quarters without ill effect, with the standard disclaimer that you might be hypersensitive to opiates, and that I&#039;m making assumptions about your weight being about average.<br /><br />You could chew the quarter tablet to get a quicker onset. Do not consider consuming any more than a quarter of the pill before 12 hours has elapsed.<br /><br />An example might help: I do not have an opiate tolerance. I weigh about 110 kg. If I were to take 25 mg of MS contin and then follow this 4 hours later with another 25 mg of the same, I would become unpleasantly affected by morphine and would vomit.<br /><br />However, if the morphine pill you have is no continuous release and is instead an immediate release tablet then do not take the above advice as it will likely render you unconscious, although you are unlikely to die unless you lose consciousness and adopt a face-up position and then the opiate causes you to vomit into your mouth, and then aspirate the vomit.<br /><br />If it is an immediate release pill and you take the whole thing it is likely that you will overdose to the extent that you require hospitalisation or at least informed medical care. If you are hypersensitive to opiates 100 mg is likely to kill you.<br /><br />If you have an immediate release tablet then consider dissolving it in 100 mL (~3 flOz) of hot water and drinking 10 mL of the resulting solution. 10 mg of morphine is likely to be enough to give you a reasonable effect.<br /><br />

				you didnt provide enough information to be asking that question<br /><br />such as whats your tolerance, how do you plan on taking it, etc? <br /><br />and some people are particularly sensitive to morphine even if they can handle other opiates and opioids due to the increased histamine release

				Yo dude. my third opiate experience was with statex morphine sulfate IR 50mg, about 1/3 of it WITH NO TOLERANCE, crushed, mixed with 2mL of warm water in an oral syringe and plugged.<br /><br />That being said, my suggestion go you if it is ir and you have no tolerance is to take 1/8 of that rectally, as the only other highly bioavailable method is iv.<br /><br />Opiate dosing isnt realistic if we dont know your tolerance.

				Assuming no tolerance and a 100 mg dose, i expect we will not hear much from this guy anytime soon.<br /><br />Without developed tolerance a dose of 10 mg is quite likely to have very noticable effects, if not knocking you out right then and there.<br /><br />Something like 10 mg is the typical dose given IV after painful surgery mending bones and such - and its enough to knock out a fair number of patients without opiate experience for a few hours even if that wasn&#039;t the intention.

				Finding hard data on that will prove difficult since its not a medically used route of administration, afaik. <br /><br />As far as the availability goes from using tablets: it makes quite a big difference between simply swallowing the tablet and chewing it up. The data presented are usually based on simply downing a tablet with a glass of water, and may be on the low side compared to realistic use.
