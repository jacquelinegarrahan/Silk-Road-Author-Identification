				Hello my American friends. I&#039;m sorry but I have to inform you: you are doing it wrong! ;D<br />Here is what the DEA should do: https://www.youtube.com/user/DrugEducationAgency<br /><br />Now serious.<br />It&#039;s a really good format, recently I re-watched all of the 27 episodes (31 by now) and I&#039;m still loving it. :-)<br />Good content about various drugs, it is in German tho, so, sorry for everyone not able to understand German. But for all Germans: Schaut es euch an, bestes Format dieser Art auf Youtube by far.<br /><br />There is also a special episode called 70 years LSD on a partner channel called nachtschatten television which I really liked. Check it out!<br /><br />(If anyone knows more formats like this please leave a message, the ONLY thing I know apart from DEA and exzessivtv is neurosoup, and she is awesome. &lt;3)<br /><br />If you don&#039;t speak German check out NeuroSoup, she also does drug education in her videos.

It&#039;s really time to stop all this nazi shit when it comes to Germans. You can not imagine how annoying it is for a generation that has absolutely nothing to do with it. Believe me we had this shit so much in school it&#039;s ridiculous, yes it is important, but it was total overkill. Also as of today, the USA is much worse than Germany, look at all this shit like the patriot act or guantanamo/abu-grahib or the NSA spying allied country&#039;s without any shame. Then there was a time of heavy government supported racism not long ago, even after WWII. I guess you could go an for ever when it comes to America. Like every country has it&#039;s dark past, or even present when you look at the USA.

				Thank you. :)<br />What was his point then? It sounds like the typical bashing of Germans with their history. I would prefer if you Americans would just call us KRAUTS all day long. That is kind of sweet I have to say.<br />Everybody loves Sauerkraut if it&#039;s done right. ;)<br /><br />edit: OMG I am so stupid. He just meant the real DEA. -.-<br />Sorry.

I&#039;m not sure if you, TSX, thought I was agreeing with what Cyana....oh fuck it, I&#039;m...just had a nice pipe of Parvati charas. <br /><br />What I mean to say is, I agree with what TSX said in his second comment about people German bashing and how young German&#039;s, most of whom, I think, are appalled with what Hitler did, have that label thrust upon them and about Americal da de da de da. &quot;Terrorism, it&#039;s OK if you&#039;re doing it for America&quot;- In Jimmy Cliff&#039;s immortal words, possibly slightly misquoted, but near enough!

And then you have these neo-nazi demonstrations that are even covered by the police to protect them from anyone else. It&#039;s Democratic, ok. But it makes me SICK to see it happening. And I would say it&#039;s safe to say that this is making 99.999% of Germans also want to puke when they see neo-nazis wandering through the streets, being protected with tax money.

				I like neurosoup but I can&#039;t support Krystle Cole (the neurosoup girl). She snitched out Pickard with her husband which led to one of the biggest LSD busts in history in the US. Led to more shitty LSD and higher prices for this shitty LSD. She has good info but I have no respect for her. Theres a Vice documentary on LSD with her in it. I hope you guys have checked it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qliVpGEk0

				Sorry I&#039;ll clear things up, I have nothing wrong with Germans. The kidnapping I&#039;m referring to is law enforcement &quot;Arresting&quot; people, and I&#039;m saying educating them would be better than arresting them.

				I watched the video, the place/palace was interesting but the almost nude pictures of her were the bomb really. ;D<br />She is even sexier than I thought. The moderator was very annoying though.
