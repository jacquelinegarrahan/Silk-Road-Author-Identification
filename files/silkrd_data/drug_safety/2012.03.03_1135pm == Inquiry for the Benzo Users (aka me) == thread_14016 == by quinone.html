				Has anyone tried Estazolam and how did you find it compared to other benzos?&nbsp; <br /><br />Did you find it to be more or less one whose only practical purpose is as a delta wave induction hypnotic (BENZO SLEEP AID).&nbsp; Having tried flunitrazepam (YES YES I know what it is ! lol) I found it hard to enjoy other elements of a benzo high due to the powerful delta wave sedating effects.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in getting my hands on some again actually if I see it up here, but being the &#039;date rate drug&#039; (flunitrazepam = rohypnol) it&#039;s been rare on SR.<br /><br />There are 1mg estazolam&#039;s listed at an extremely cheap price, so if any benzo users who&#039;ve used it can give me your experiences i&#039;d appreciate it (don&#039;t even utter a word about benzo equivalency chart, asking for personal experiences pls :) .. that and I doubt you have a clue how to interpret the BEC as no one seems to heh.

				strange, that is one I have never actually heard of before. <br /><br />Since the rhesus monkeys like it, I am sure you will too&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If anyone has experience Id also be curious to hear about the subjective effects

I consider Meth absolutely disgusting ... for me, but if that&#039;s your drug of preference I still wouldn&#039;t judge you ... or that SWIM guy that seems so popular :D).<br />
