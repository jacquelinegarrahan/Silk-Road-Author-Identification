				Hello good people,<br /><br />I have hypertension which is controlled by lisinopril 40mg. I recently had a few experiences with duderug&#039;s 2ci-nbome, 2-6mg doses.<br /><br />I have decided that, although I truely enjoy this drug despite the mild side effects of sweating, especially heavy forehead/eye sweating, I need to find a different psychedelic to test. My blood pressure skyrockets on this stuff. Even at a 2mg dose it goes very high, almost to 200/120. It&#039;s scary for me and I would rather trip without a quiet acceptance of the potential for death, which I find helps to clear the fear of the cardiovascular effects from my conscious thoughts.<br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations? LSD is so expensive, but I&#039;m planning to save for a good quality 10 strip.<br /><br />I have read some reports that the 4-aco-DMT/DET and DOC can cause hypertension, especially in very strong doses. I typically do not need a strong dose for psychedelics. 2mg of 2ci-nbome gives me great visual effects.<br /><br />Longer lasting effects would also be desirable. I like the idea of day tripping with DOC, but I don&#039;t want any cardio effects. I find that 2ci-nbome is over before i&#039;m ready to stop tripping, except for the 5-6mg dose I took a week ago. That was a ride.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				I would just like to say that 2-6 mg is a ridiculously high dose range for that stuff. the only reason someone should take that much 25i-nbome is if they are dosing too often because of its extreme tolerance effects. 0.5 - 1.5 mg is a much more appropriate dosage.

				Shrooms would be your best bet but honestly I prefer the side effects of LSD or nbome over the nausea and stomach aches I get from shrooms.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get a speedy feeling from nbome at all, but I have yet to take it without smoking weed during the trip either, perhaps that&#039;s another alternative.

				Shrooms are out because of the physical side effects. LSD is out because of the ridiculous price.<br /><br />4-Ac0-DMT was on my radar. I&#039;ve read about cardio side effects with overdoses, but maybe that&#039;s only for over doses. I am going to get 100mg and see how she does.<br /><br />2mg is a reasonable dose of duderug&#039;s 2ci-nbome. I get very little visuals on 1mg. I still get the same cardio effects when I took 1 or took 4. When I took more than 1-2, I would always offset the dosing by an hour or so to limit the effects.

I have not taken LSD in 15 years or so, so no idea what it does to my BP.<br /><br />I have never had a bad trip, ever. I&#039;ve tripped many times (maybe ~60 times?) The last time I did 25i-nbome, I was trying to control my closed eye visuals and ended up seeing some flesh getting sliced open with razors. I opened my eyes and all was back to ok. The first time I dosed, I took 2mg right off the bat and my BP spiked to ~190/110 IIRC. Super high and unsafe. Unless it went insane (&gt;220/130) I would not go to the hospitol. Otherwise I take a &quot;if I die, I die. no need to freak out about it&quot; approach to trips. When I deal with cops, I don&#039;t let myself get upset, I just think &quot;If I go to jail, I go to jail, no worries.&quot; I&#039;ve never gone to jail :)<br /><br />Anyways, thanks for the input. I ordered some 4-Ac0-DMT and will be trying that and will report back. I&#039;m going to try a 15mg dose (with a 5mg booster ~T+2hrs if I feel like I can handle it.) Hopefully it does not effect my BP and the trip is good enough for me. I&#039;ve never had a proper shroom trip. We smoked shrooms, and I dosed 2g of some weak shrooms once. I never got any visuals.

				Steer clear of shrooms, they do in fact speed up your BP and this can lead to a full on anxiety attack. So far my favorite psychedelic that is very gentle is 2c-i. Try a 13-15mg dose and see how you like it.

				I don&#039;t have anxiety attacks under any substance. I&#039;m mentally capable of any experience, even 10-12 hour LSD trips. I *will* be getting some LSD from a vender when I can afford ~10 hits of ~200ug. Hopefully it won&#039;t effect my BP too much.<br /><br />Shrooms are out because of the nausea. I just can&#039;t get down on a drug that makes me chuck. Alcohol included.<br /><br />I may try 2CI, but 2ci-nbome causes my BP to spike hard. I&#039;m thinking 2CI would do the same. Maybe not. It did not effect my friend&#039; BP AT ALL and he took 4-6MG his first time. (hard to know exactly how much. I think the last 2 hits were wasted as they were taken too far into the trip.)<br /><br />I am waiting on some 4-AcO-DMT. I hope it&#039;s the wonder-drug I&#039;m looking for. After that I&#039;m saving up for some good LSD. Hopefully the scammers all die in a rape factory in hell by the time I&#039;m ready to order.<br /><br />Buying bitcoins anonymously is difficult for me... I got some via a service (I forget the address) where you western union money to NYC and he sends you bitcoins, but he charged ~$6.5US per BTC which was ~1.5 over the going rate.<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely interested in any reputable anonymous services that offer more reasonable rates without such a huge profit margin.

I don&#039;t mind a body buzz, and I don&#039;t mind a head trip, but I would prefer something that has less of those and more visual halucinations. If it were not for the body effects of 2ci-nbome, I would love that stuff. I would still like to do it 1 more time as a daylight trip and get in a pool and float about.

				I dosed quite a lot of 4-AcO-DMT yesterday with little effects. I&#039;ve gone ~2 weeks since my 2ci-nbome experiences and should have no tolerance.<br /><br />T+0hr = 15mg mixed in juice, and drank on an empty stomach<br />T+.5hr = racey effects. heart rate goes up<br />T+1hr = slight open eye visuals. closed eye visuals were weak. Minor thought shifting but I easily came back to &quot;it&#039;s just a drug&quot;, &quot;it&#039;s just a movie&quot; (we dosed right as the movie &quot;Promethius&quot; 3d started. not a terrible movie btw.)<br />T+1.5hr = face melting/cartoon-like visuals but quick and fleeting.<br />T+2hr = fading effects, very shroom like perspective distortion. No more mental sillyness, but I did find it easy to find words I was looking for and ended up taking pauses in my speech occasionally to remember words such as &quot;costume&quot;.<br />T+3hr = 10mg snorted<br />T+3.5hr = 15mg drunk<br /><br />There were some minor visual effects ~T+5hr but it was very very weak. I can only assume that a tolerance effect had already come into play. I still have 30mg which is already dissolved in water. I am going to drink the entire thing early one morning and see what happens. I&#039;ll be recording heart rate and bp then. I couldn&#039;t do that in the movies. My vendor has a great rep, so certainly the 4-AcO-DMT isn&#039;t adulterated/weakened purposefully. Perhaps it was contaminated in some way? I could take the 30mg tomorrow morning, but I think it would probably be a better idea to wait a week or more.<br /><br />Any input? Thanks!

				I&#039;m glad you found the 4-AcO pleasurable! Having said that, it&#039;s always better to wait before doing another session; especially since you took a total of 40mgs your first session and didn&#039;t notice any additional effects after the two additional doses at 3 and 3.5 hours by the 5 hour mark.<br /><br />best of luck,<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

I&#039;m thinking about doing DOC once as well. I don&#039;t want to get a bunch of it though. I might message one of the multi-chemical vendors and get a package put together with ~2.5mg of DOC, 2mg of 2ci-nbome (I want to daytime trip once on it), and a bunch of DMT.<br /><br />I should note that the 2ci-nbome was complexed (HPBCD?) to be orally active. I read that 1mg was a good dose, 2mg was a strong dose, and higher was possible.

I didn&#039;t notice any tolerance with a week break between trips. I shared 22mg. doses with three more people - two of them had best trip of their life and one barely felt anything (she didn&#039;t take any drugs for at least two months, so no tolerance). I would guess some people are less sensitive to 4-aco-dmt, so increase your dose. Wait a week and take 35mg. on empty stomach. Don&#039;t quote me on that, but I think I read that snorting or vaping this stuff is less effective and pleasant than oral dosing. Rectal doses are twice as little, and people of Bluelight recommend taking it this way;)<br />Like sdesu said - stay away from phenethylamines (that includes DOC, I haven&#039;t tried it before, but people say it&#039;s very heavy on the body).<br />Good luck, and stay safe:)

				Thanks for that info. I have ~32mg in water I&#039;m going to take when I first wake up about 2 weeks from now. I want to have a daytime experience around my house, but might have a friend come get me for a movie after it&#039;s fading.<br /><br />One thing I will note about yesterday and today. When I woke up yesterday I tooled around the house for a couple hours, but decided to ride my motorcycle. I made it 100 yards down the road and noticed a slight euphoria and intensity of visuals. Colors were bright, etc. It was very very mild so I decided to ride on instead of going home, and it faded to nothing. I also have been having very strong dreams and remembering them well.<br /><br />Today I woke up and right as I first woke up, feeling like I woke immediately out of a dream, I had symptoms of HPPD. I had mild open eye static, and mild closed eye visuals. The visuals were weak, but they were clearly visual imagination type. I repeatedly saw a tire from the aspect of an ant, rolling to a stop near me, and then saw a tire from the top doing a burn out and taking off. There were flashes of other images as well. I went to the bathroom and from the toilet saw the tiles breathing a bit. I was considerably disturbed. I had breathing walls/tiles when I focused on them for years after I stopped taking LSD. It was very slight and only when I stared at them, but it was legitimately breathing.<br /><br />I had considered futher experimenting with DOC and DMT (and one more 2ci-nbome experience) but I think I&#039;m done after this next 4-aco-dmt dose. I don&#039;t want to risk my sanity or ending up with HPPD for a longer period. Hopefully it does not return tomorrow, because if it does I&#039;ll give away the 4-aco-dmt I still have to a friend.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice guys.

I feel like I checked off insane visual distortion from my list with 2ci-nbome. It&#039;s quite nice for that.
