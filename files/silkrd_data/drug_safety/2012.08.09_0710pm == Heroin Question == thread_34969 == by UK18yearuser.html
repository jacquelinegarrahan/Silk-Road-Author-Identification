				Title: <strong>Heroin Question</strong><br />

				Been a user for 18yrs now, always chased the dragon(smoked). When I started smoking the gear it was always very light brown Heroin, nearly white. You put it on the foil and it ran clean with no signs of cut(I know there was cut in there but very little and you could not tell). The strength was proper and prices were cheap. <br /><br />Around 8 years things started to go down hill, gear started to become more brown, strength became low, and it ran dirty on the foil.<br /><br />It has become to the point that UK heroin is so shit around 10% now, so much cut, the only thing that has stayed the same is the price.<br /><br />So i here about Silk Road and I think this is my savior, some of the old school gear would be great, I new the prices would be bit sharp, but quality you have to pay for.<br /><br />I have tried most of the No3 Heroin vendors and even though the quality on average is much, much better than the Uk, I have yet to find the No3 Heroin of the early 2000&#039;s.<br /><br />My question is:-<br />Where has it gone?<br />It still must be out there, what ever the price.<br /><br />So my thread is to a current vendor, or a new vendor, or a thinking about becoming a vendor.<br /><br />I am sure that there would be plenty of custom for any vendor who could salvage this No3 Heroin.<br /><br />I am a customer and any Silk Road customer who agree please reply to this thread to let the vendors know that there would be a large customer base. <br /><br />:-from a searcher of the old No 3,&nbsp; gear.

				There are plenty of vendors who offer high quality heroin, go to the Rumor Mill and look through the heroin vendor review threads and see who&#039;s getting the highest ratings.

				As I am wary of receiving foreign mail during Olympics, I have just placed an order for 0.5g of Afghan Apothecaries &quot;Gun powder&quot; dark brown H. I have to say, I am a bit aprehensive, I got some of his standard H and it was garbage to be honest. I didn&#039;t complain or down rate it as it was my first order. I have had plenty dark brown H in India and I really like it- it seems to have a broader spectrum of opioids in it. I have only read one real review that did seem a bit &quot;shillish&quot;<br />When I get it I will do a report on it- AA does seem to be quite honest about the quality of his gear- I peruse his page often, out of interest (apart from the &quot;morphine sulphate&quot; debacle!).<br />We shall see!!!
