				So, I&#039;ve come a little ways with DMT, originally picking some up and wasting the lot on imperfect methods/temperature, then picking up a digital volcano and, well, it&#039;s been sweet dreams from that point on.<br /><br />That being said - and I think I&#039;ve read every existing thread on &quot;breaking through&quot; so far - I&#039;m still learning the ropes and not finding a lot of descriptive content about pre-breakthrough experiences. I know people report increased heart rate, some visual fluctuation or even irritation, but advice is to &quot;blast past&quot; this and the discomfort goes away.<br /><br />Can anyone offer some descriptions of pre-breakthrough experiences on DMT? I&#039;m curious if what I&#039;m experiencing is at all similar.<br /><br />Brief recap of my own experiences since trying it with the cano:<br /><br />Vapour itself is thick and white. Seems very dense. I always get the impression that the bag is a little reluctant to fully inflate when I&#039;m filling it with DMT vapour<br /><br />1st experience: instant colour change/light change (more light in room, colours off). Strong odour (not burnt; kind of sweet) and flavour. Severe field of vision waver. I panic a bit and ease off, getting no deeper. I have trouble imagining wanting to ingest a whole bag having reached this point on something like 2 breaths.<br /><br />2nd: colour/light change, as before. Smell/flavour as before. No immediate visual waver, though. Audio enhanced. Psychedelic overlay on top of everything (like a neon patina over all objects). CEV are intense - striped bands of moving colours - very psychedelic. Spent a bit of time exploring whether there were any potentially difficult ego effects. Decided the potential was there but not worrisome, but by that time the trip was done.<br /><br />3rd: colour/light change, which I&#039;m beginning to recognize as the space for this particular drug, at least pre-breakthrough. I had known that you can hit DMT again after about an hour if desired, so I was less worried about not getting in deep enough in one go as I could play with this all night if I wanted to explore the space and not give in to fear. However, I discovered that I can titrate within the hour without a problem. So this time I take a few deep breaths from the bag and hold, enter the space. Then add additional breaths whenever I want to push the experience or when I&#039;m coming down and don&#039;t want to. This all greatly helps dissipate the fear as I find I have quite a bit of control over the experience. Altogether VERY positive and my worries are gone. Oh, I also come close to experiencing something new - kind of... dimensional breaking is the best way I can explain it. Ever play the game Fez? Kind of like that. But by that point my bag was empty and I wasn&#039;t going to re-dose completely so I left that for another time.<br /><br />4th: same evening as third, same dose re-heated/vaped. I&#039;ve reduced temp a bit to avoid burning the spice. Vapour is thick and white as ever. Colour/light change as usual, and I get the psych patina back, but it&#039;s all... darker. I struggle a bit to maintain a clear, positive perspective, but I get (for the first time in years) hints of a potential &quot;bad trip&quot; (insect-specific). It&#039;s not good. I muck around a bit more in the space, slowly finishing the bag, but I&#039;m done.<br /><br />For someone who cut their teeth on shrooms and later LSD, the speed with which the trip comes up and then dissipates is simply staggering. <br /><br />Thoughts? Observations? Accounts? If you were to draw a map from &quot;sober and lucid&quot; to &quot;breakthrough&quot;, how far on this map have I travelled? Am I in the lobby? Down the corridor? Still outside the whole structure?<br />

				If you want to research on the pre/post-breakthrough states of DMT I highly suggest you to go with yellow DMT.<br /><br />DMT-N-Oxide, in fact - differently from N-N-DMT - doesn&#039;t change drastically when a certain threshold is met. By increasing the dosage you just increase the intensity of the experience, but it will take a very high dosage for it to change totally (as it happens with white DMT).<br /><br />Yellow DMT will stay comfortably in the pre-breakthrough (maybe more precisely in the POST-breakthrough) territory of white DMT for a long time. If you like that territory better (or want to research on it thoroughly before diving in the breakthrough experience), there&#039;s nothing better than DMT-N-Oxide.<br /><br />As for &quot;where you are&quot; in correlation to the breakthrough it&#039;s really impossible to say. As I said with DMT the experience suddenly changes after a certain threshold, it becomes a totally different thing (and when you have experienced it you know without the shadow of a doubt; if you are unsure if you had a breakthrough you surely haven&#039;t had one). So it&#039;s literally impossible to discern if you are near or far from it by judging what you experience in a boundary trip just because they have nothing in common.

I want to add a thing specific to this.<br /><br />Until you don&#039;t willfully research the experience, don&#039;t re-heat a previously heated DMT or old residue of it. The effects are different (ranging from mildly to strongly different depending on various factors). The resin that forms it is not the same in effect of pure DMT, it is a sort of mix between DMT-N-Oxide and 5-Meo-DMT (the more older the resin or the more heated before the more it will be more akin to 5-Meo); this means much less visuals, less colors, more body load (sometimes this particular part can get really uncomfortable if you are not prepared for it as I experienced myself my first time it happened and this got me to research about this) and a &quot;darker&quot; tone all in all.<br /><br />As I said, until you don&#039;t want to specifically research on those experiences stay away from the resin. Especially at beginning it&#039;s a sure way to get a bad trip because you cannot recognize what the hell is happening.

				Appreciate the responses, BlackIris.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mention it but you are correct, the body load on the re-vape was indeed heavier and very uncomfortable (severe muscle tension). Not particularly opposed to exploring that space but will be mindful of the potential differences if/when doing so.<br /><br />Wise words no doubt on the map question. What you say makes sense. <br /><br />You are also correct, without me noting, that this was N-N-DMT. Hadn&#039;t been sure on the differences between white and yellow and may give vendors a look with this in mind. Hasn&#039;t been a lot of choice in domestic vendors in my neck of the woods, so may or may not be able to swing it. Any experience with processing your own? I am not a chemistry grad. The process... does not look simple.<br /><br />Welcome to any more thoughts or observations from anyone on the subject. Thanks in advance.

Look on Erowid for Noman&#039;s Tek. With a couple of tries (use small amounts to try at first, like 25 or 50 g) you can do it without problems, I assure you.<br />As for making DMT-N-Oxide, that&#039;s very easy, evap the naphtha to obtain DMT in full air instead of freeze precipitating it, done. DMT-N-Oxide forms when the DMT is in contact with air. If you put the naphtha to evaporate in with full air (as for example with a fan on top of it) you will have almost full DMT-N-Oxide (naturally the contrary is true if you want N-N-DMT, in that case be sure the less air comes in contact with the process and it&#039;s better freeze prec).<br />
