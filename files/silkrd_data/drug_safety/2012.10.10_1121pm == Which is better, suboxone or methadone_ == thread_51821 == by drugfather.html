				I&#039;m currently on suboxone to help with my addiction but it just isn&#039;t doing it. <br /><br /><br />Which opiate is more pleasurable? (I can&#039;t live without being at least buzzed off of opiates, I&#039;ve tried and I just can&#039;t do it so which one feels better? Also I get chronic migraines, which one would help better with pain?)

				Methadone has the potential to be more pleasurable than suboxone.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Like with most things, if you take it every day, you aren&#039;t going to feel anything from it.&nbsp; But, it will help you maintain. <br /><br />Methadone is also more effective for treating pain (for me at least).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are on either of these every day, neither will cause a buzz.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am one of the few &#039;success&#039; stories that I know of using Suboxone.&nbsp; But, after 4 years I still take it every day (1/8th of a 2mg tablet).&nbsp; No relapse yet though. I also have to give a HUGE thanks to Cannabis for helping me stay off of opiates. <br /><br />A lot of the people that I know have NOT had good luck with Suboxone and are on Methadone.&nbsp; Where we live, you have to go to a clinic every day for the methadone and that just doesn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve become a bit of a hermit and when I was initially fighting my addiction I began living a cloistered life.&nbsp; I had to cut myself off from all of the people that were a part of that old lifestyle.&nbsp; I even started working from home so that I only have to leave the house very rarely.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think if you were to put a needle and some IV&#039;able opiate in front of me that I could refrain from doing it, but I don&#039;t know that I could. I can refrain from ordering on SR because it isn&#039;t instant ... and because I have so many nice buds to spend my btc on :]

				I was on Methadone for years.&nbsp; When Suboxone was legalized in the U.S., I immediately found a doctor who was willing to prescribe Suboxone. It worked like magic. For those who aren&#039;t aware, Methadone is the worst addiction that one would ever want to try to kick.&nbsp; The Suboxone worked like magic.&nbsp; Within two weeks, I was off Methadone AND Suboxone with NO withdrawl symptoms.&nbsp; The best thing that I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; Now for people who just want to use Suboxone for euphoria or even pain relief, I couldn&#039;t guess one way or the other.&nbsp; I strongly suspect that Methadone is a far more effective pain killer.

				Methadone is so awful to kick, but it has a great high I think. Those fucking WD&#039;s aren&#039;t worth it though they lasted like twice as long as heroin WD&#039;s

				You can&#039;t answer this question for everybody cause every human&nbsp; is different but you can say:<br /><br />Subuxone:<br /><br />- people with a short drug history and a low tolerance <br />- calm people (calm without any drug)<br /><br /><br />methadone:<br /><br />- people with a longer drug history and higher tolerance<br />- anxious people (anxious without any drug)

				methadone is a maintenance drug, buprenorphine is a detox drug, bupe should only be used short term for when you are serious about coming off opiates. if you are not sure or want to use on top now and again then go for methadone.<br /><br />I done a bupe detox and was clean for 4 years afterwards, I do use still now but I know my limits, a few weeks max not months or years. it was really easy to come off, went right down to 0.4mg using generic bupe, only used it for 3 months and the worst I had was a little insomnia and a runny nose, for a few days.<br /><br />the fact you are asking what is more pleasurable I would say you are not ready to go on buprenorphine. best to go on methadone, you can always switch to bupe if/when you feel ready.
