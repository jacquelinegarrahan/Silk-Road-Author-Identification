				Hello everyone. So my friend and I ate some of kwiktrip&#039;s 25i and we are experiencing extremely long duration. We are at a + and it has been 38 hours. In the morning my friend was still at a ++.<br /><br />It&#039;s actually beautiful, total oneness, ying yang, the flow of everything.<br /><br />...but, I was wondering if anyone has experienced this with 25i in general or with kwiktrip&#039;s 25i. We just want to be sure so we can recommend this correct chemical to people and not spread misinformation. <br /><br />EDIT: I personally ate half a hit of LSD on Friday... 1.2mg of 25i on Saturday, then 2mg on Sunday night (EDC... we don&#039;t normally trip like this). My friend tripped a little less than me with slightly lower doses.

				38h is pretty extreme, I just finished the last of my 25i from kwiktrip, trips for me were really intense compared to what I read of others, but it only lasted a few hours with slight residual effects for a couple hours after. And that was on the same dosage you took, and twice at a higher dosage.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had high dose LSD trips that have lasted days before, not the full trip but I had motion trails and pulsation for days after the trip.

				WOW, that&#039;s a weekend trip literally. Glad to hear that it&#039;s still active (not extreme tolerance) after using it back to back. I&#039;ve read that you needed at least a week between 25i trips?!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />

On a few occasions I tripped back to back days on 25i and still tripped without a noticeable tolerance.

				I have some 25i-nbome 1mg blotters and haven&#039;t had the courage to try. Could you please describe your trip a bit more? Especially the trip unaffected by LSD - was it all good and dandy and did you take more because you felt like the last one was wearing off?

The first time at home I tried 1mg and smoked a lot of weed and had a +++ trip (this was 3 weeks before EDC). On Saturday when I dropped 1.2mg I was at a ++, everything became the fibonacci sequence but without any ego death. I was still me and every single thing was spiraling. Let&#039;s say I dropped that around 10pm on Saturday. There were a shit load of lights everywhere because of EDC but I could tell they were much brighter and my spacial perception was distorted. Music sounds way better, almost infinite. It felt like I could ride the sound waves as I danced. People&#039;s voices sounded robotic, almost like they had auto-tune. I woke up Sunday around 1pm and I was still very aware of the spiral and textures (+). Around 6pm I was still at the same level. Sunday I dropped 1.5mg at 8pm, then 500ug around 10pm. It got to a ++ for a little but then I was back at a +. BUT when I got home around 3pm I smoked some weed and it brought back the trip to a +++ and I became &quot;God&quot;. It&#039;s 6:40pm on Tuesday and I&#039;m still aware textures.<br /><br />It is very smooth. No body load or anxiety. You should just do it, I found it more therapeutic and smooth than LSD and mushrooms. My friend said it was the strongest experience he&#039;s ever had apart from breaking through on DMT.<br /><br />Also, my friend tripped way harder than me. I meant to say he tripped less times, but it sounds like he was at a +++ with 1.5mg on Sunday. He tripped on 2c-c on Friday and 2c-i on Thursday.<br /><br />I do recommend this but I find it unusual that it&#039;s lasting this long. I don&#039;t know if the dose is correct or I got the wrong chemical. This is the only 25i I&#039;ve tried.<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s so therapeutic that after my first trip I didn&#039;t want to trip ever again because I felt like I &quot;knew&quot; everything (not in a pretentious way, but the trip showed me so much). But it was EDC so we went for it. Neither my friend or I feel tripping again or even smoking weed now. This is coming from someone who used to trip once a week.

Personally I can hardly tell the difference in my trips between lsd and nbome, I get completely different visuals than both from shrooms but both lsd and nbome I get very similar visuals. Personally, I love it since it reacts as a cheap LSD alternative for me that doesn&#039;t last as long.

I think a lot of people aren&#039;t dosing correctly so they have weak trips. Your mouth should be clean and it should be on your upper gums for a while. I left it there longer than the instructions said.<br /><br />Also, smoking weed makes any trip way stronger. It&#039;s a quick fix.
