				This post might be better served in rumor mill, but i think that my question is more geared to this forum. I use to take gel tabs and they were strong and clean lsd. it was a trip and wonderful lsd trip. i&#039;ve tried a couple doses here, but nothing to me seems like legit L. Are people even making real L anymore? And does anyone have a recommendation on a vendor that will give me the lsd experience.<br /><br />*again, I apologize if this comment seems out of the right forum, but i think it is better served here in a drug safety context.

				The LSD vendors reviews: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7077.0<br /><br />The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avengers LSD team tests LSD and post their findings here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />I suggest you look there for answers. I haven&#039;t got my introduction yet to Lucy, I will meet her soon though.

				3jane or JOR<br /><br /><br />Check the avengers out like TreeSpirit said, there are other Star vendors but i can attest for 3Jane... she gave me my first LSD tabs and i just knew they were the real deal when i took them... Magic does exist and its when your tripping on LSD.

				Yea dude, always 3Jane, JOR&nbsp; and NSC to name the best L that is most always avail. 3Janes listings post quite often and are over ten times as fast, so have your btc ready. Her L is by far some of the most reputable ,clean and legit LSD that is available. JOR i havnt personaly ordered from yet, but hes gotten lots of good publicity from lots of heavy hitters in the SR LSD community. NSC shit has been plentiful , dosed accurately and def clean legit L thats more than worth the price he ask&#039;s.<br />&nbsp;Then theres the other vendors with the best LSD SR has to offer like VitaCat , DelEllis and Albion.. only ive been a member for like three months now and have spent the majority of that time and most of my BTC on LSD, and ive yet to see listings from the two, VitaCats listing ive passed up on cause he is a bit expensive, but well worth it from what i understand. hope some of this helped. Goodluck
