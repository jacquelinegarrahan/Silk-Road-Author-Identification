				Doctors will always say self-medication is bad, but I call bullshit.<br /><br />I do my research, and the doctors refuse to help me.<br /><br />So I come to Silk Road for help with my Severe ADHD and Bipolar.<br /><br />What would be some good drugs to help manage ADHD (a good solid stim) and something to help keep me from going off the deep end in mania (other than weed, anyway?)<br /><br />Would a combination of MDPPP or MDPV and etizolam or some maybe an AM-* series synthetic cannabinoid?<br /><br />I defer to your superior expertise on this, and all I ask is that we try to stick to powerful synthetic drugs as much as possible. it&#039;s easier to get purer synthetics.<br /><br />&quot;all natural&quot; is all fine and good, but what i want is powerful tools to control my own brain. it&#039;s my body, i should have full control.<br /><br />with that context, what specific synthetic drugs would you guys suggest for general utilitarian management of my mental disorders?<br /><br />Obviously, if i want to have fun, i&#039;d like the flexibility of not having something conflict/interact horribly, since the last thing i need is to cut my already-short life even shorter.

				As some with bipolar and ADD, I take Adderall XR. It works well enough. I also take Lamotrigine.<br /><br />But exercise and diet are just as important as the stimulants. So you have to do that too!<br /><br />Also I recommend 100mg of 5-HTP a day. Make sure that you slowly taper these doses up. And if you experience mania, STOP THE ADDERALL IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />In my experience MDPV doesn&#039;t work well for my conditions. It&#039;s a little too strong and has too much jitters.<br /><br />And a synthetic cannabinoid sounds like a terrible idea for ADD, wouldn&#039;t do that.

So dextroamphetamine, then? and lamotrigine? isnt lamotrigine a sodium-gated inhibitor or something? it reduces ALL neural activity? wouldn&#039;t that interfere with thinking in general?<br /><br />Is there some way to mood stabilize that doesnt reduce all neural activity? sorry about being so persistant, but i&#039;m not sure that method would work for me, also, i&#039;m not sure i can get a dextroamphetamine salt here on SR.

				Well, I&#039;m not sure... lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant and it hasn&#039;t affected my cognition at all, as far as I can tell... in fact I feel no side effects from it at all. It seems to have just taken the unstable moods away. It&#039;s subtle, but it works.<br /><br />And Adderall isn&#039;t d-amph, it&#039;s a mixed amphetamine salt combo... about 75% d-amph. I&#039;m only speaking from what I do. I&#039;m NOT qualified to advise you medically.<br /><br />Personally, I can only tell you what works for me, and offer my advice that you do see a doc... maybe the ones you&#039;ve seen don&#039;t have the personalities that work best for you. Maybe your approach might be a little off-kilter, although I really do need to stress that I speak only in the hypothetical and in fact I sympathize and feel much the same... But you shouldn&#039;t approach mental illness alone. External help is always good. Consider alternatives and keep an open mind, but also pursue what you think will help. I guess in the mental health game everything&#039;s just a balance...<br /><br />Best of luck to you though. I wish you the same well-being that I&#039;ve managed to find.

				Virtually all mental insufficiency (ADD, ADHD, dementia, etc) is caused by a combination of malnutrition, ingestion of toxins, and enculturation. <br />Note that mental insufficiency is never caused by insufficient use of pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs are used primarily to obscure the damage caused by these factors, inevitably leading to further mental deterioration both from the effects of the drugs and from neglect of the underlying problems. Unless you&#039;re taking 10g vitamin C daily and eating wild fruits and plants all day outside in the forest, the problem is probably largely your diet and your exposure to toxins. You should start taking nutritional supplements (in moderation, except for vitamin C), and avoiding consumption of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs). You can also try Piracetam, it&#039;s very effective at increasing the physical capacity of your brain in a sustainable manner. I sell a product on SR that you might benefit from, others with similar situations have found it to be effective. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0c67958f9a<br /><br />As for synthetic cannabinoids, no one should consume them, ever. As John W. Huffman (aka JWH, the inventor of synthetic cannabinoids) said, <br />“People who use it [synthetic cannabinoids] are idiots. You don’t know what it’s going to do to you.”<br /><br />If you want a &#039;classic&#039; stimulant, I&#039;d recommend low doses (10-30mg) of Methylone.

				I have ADD and apparently cyclothymia too. I have a script for vyvanse and neurontin. They work when I take them properly.
