				DMT gets you there fairly quickly, and even though it doesn&#039;t last long in real life minutes, in your head it will be a few hours if not more.&nbsp; Your friend lucy can get you to a similar state, probably with a little more control of yourself, take maybe 500mcg and after a couple hours if you need more, take more tabs until you&#039;re where you want to be.&nbsp; Just remember to go into it with a very positive mindset, if you&#039;re depressed or feeling down that day, wait until you&#039;re happy.

If money is no object though, considering you have the connects to pull it off as well which doesn&#039;t seem likely, then a thumbprint is the way to go! The cliche &#039;be careful what you wish for&#039;, definitely comes into play with that though. A high dose of LSD + a DMT breakthrough at the height of the LSD trip will definitely be something to remember as well.

				Try 2c-p if you like longer trips.&nbsp; I took 15 mgs and I was tripping hard for a full 14 hours.&nbsp; The experience comes in cyclic waves, you&#039;ll be very lucid for a few minutes and then you&#039;ll just kind of slip into a heavier state of tripping.&nbsp; Visually everything looks like a watercolor painting, or at least that was the impression I had.<br /><br />The long duration is great since you don&#039;t have to worry about timing activities with the peak of the trip.&nbsp; In one trip you can go on a couple of long walks, go on a bike ride, visit a few different restaurants, play video games, listen to an album, visit friends, etc. and you&#039;ll be peaking pretty much the entire time!<br /><br />I wanna try mixing 2c-p with maybe LSD or MDMA, or both...

				Well, you could try what&nbsp; did last night. 2 mg 25I-NBOMe blotter. Been doing lots of it lately. It&#039;s great. We are coming up but have been doing it frequently and tolerance may be an issue. We decided to proceed by putting 2 mg 25-D NBOMe up our noses. What followed next I cannot conveny but I&#039;ll make it quick. We begin to feel even groovier after putting it up our nose. We lose interest in the fire and wander into a field. Things are gettng groovy as fuck. Meteor showers below tree level. Neon flora and fona. Rainbows. Everywhere. It&#039;s midnight mind you. Mostly overcast. Pitch black. Middle of emply field Fucking rainbows. Everywhere. Tubes. Everywhere. Neon rainbow tubes. Coming from the ground, encompassing everyingthing. Geometric neon tubes. Mostly red but rainbow tubes. connected to me, to my friend, to the ground, to the sky. There were streamers. Except the streamers were slow motion. As one of us walked, 6 would follow behind and then disapear. I watched flower tubes come out of my friends eyesockets. It was glorious. Apparently my teeth were roman numerrals. All sounds had a pitch as if they were in a tube. There were flying objects zooming everywhere. Lights in the forest. We collapsed in the field, overwhelmed, surrounded by tubes. We could see through eachothers bodies. My hands were absolutely infested with raindbow fractals. I was completely and utterly at peace with the world, as was my friend. He shoulted the entire tmie, literally in shock and awe.. Strange noises, tubes, rainbows, and flying lights. Not a single negative aspect to it. Just pure bliss. Perhaps a bit of klonapin before hand helped with this. We layed in the cold wel field in complete bliss for what seemed like hoursl, gawking at the world around us that neither of us can convey accurately with words. Gradually we came back to earth and it&#039;s been 24 hours and I feel better than I ever have in my life.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done many pyschadelics, but nothing (except perhaps for DMT t thats another animal and my experience is minimal there) but nothing, NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING compares to what we shared last night after 25c blotter followed by 25D up the nose.<br /><br />That my friend, will not only give you what you are looking for, but it&#039;s so incredibly cheap&nbsp; you can have the trip of a lifetime whenever you choose, for the rest of your life if you really want to.

				Nothing quite compares to &quot;cheesing&quot; lol. I suppose the closest thing I can think of to South Park&#039;s cat piss would be either salvia or DMT. Both of those drugs are quite powerful.

				I&#039;ve had conversations with extra terrestrial life forms on ketamine. And Buddha too, on my sofa. He wasn&#039;t as interesting as the aliens. Ketamine is a really strange drug, and imo does have the potential to be the once in a lifetime you&#039;re after.

				if you want to have a rebirth experience, try a heroic dose of shrooms (could be anywhere from 3.5 to 5 grams depending on quality). that experience completely changed my life. it started the healing process for me after a decade of sickness. what more could you ask for?

				I honestly believe you can experience a more profound trip on shrooms than acid. This is based off of 10+ trips on each and a bit of personal preference. With acid, I&#039;m sure you can experience quite a trip on a very large dose but I have never reached the mindfuck level myself. With mushrooms, even less than an eighth can blow my mind allowing me to come to realizations I wouldn&#039;t have otherwise. As a matter of fact, shrooms opened my eyes to my academic study of choice by complete accident. A confusing story that I won&#039;t venture into but just another testament to the drug&#039;s power.

				Mescaline has to be one of the best hallucinogens out there, IMO. <br /><br />I would love to set up a camping trip somewhere where I could see the northern lights (Alaska, or somewhere in Canada), and proceed to trip balls on a high dose of mescaline while laying under the stars.&nbsp;

				Last night I took 3 lsd trips (bhuddas) I knew they were weak but I wanted to test them. Didnt feel much after an hour, waited 3.5 hours in and only very mild trip.<br /><br />Then I dropped a 1000ug tab of nbome, this shit kicks in fast 30 minutes, slight feeling, then 60 minutes and the room began to melt. <br /><br />Then at plus +1 hour to +1.5 hours I remember first peak, I lost concept of time and space and lost in my mind. It lasted about 30 minutes, it reminded me a bit of first ever peak of mdma, not effect but that profound feeling something so special for the first time, better in fact, I had a tear in my eye as to how beautiful it was.<br /><br />Next shit got real, I have a massive peak and COMPLETE EGO DEATH that latest for the next 3.5 to 4 hours! Unbelievable, I didnt know who I was or remember anything about my self. <br /><br />I cannot put in to words the feeling and what I saw.<br />I remember looking at the light coming from a xbox, I didnt know what it was I feel like I was unplugged from the matrix, I could see the real reality and was unplugged from our fake reality. <br />I didnt remember how I ended this way, I knew I did something that broke reality. I manage to find a secret on a bit of paper on the black market that was the secret to the universe but once you look at it there is no coming back.<br />I started to forget what human beings where, I didnt know what I was, I didnt know what arms or legs were, I didnt understand what was me, I didnt know what any object in this world was, I couldnt tell what a tshirt was.<br />I didnt know what was real or what, I know I thought I had mother and father being, I thought of other people I loved, but they were spirtiual entities I didnt know what they looked like. <br />I then went deeper, I lost grip of even these things. Nothing was real, I kept looking deeper and deeper in to the truth of reality like they were fractual pictures. Looping deeper and deeper, I was like a molucule traveling from the beginning of the big bang to the end of time and then as space couldnt expand any more, everything imploded in its self. <br />Everytime I thought I would come to understanding of what happened I realised that nothing ever was real and I was never real. <br />Everytime I thought I thought I know what one mind fuck was I found out it was another mind fuck within a mind fuck, kinda like that inceptions movie. <br />I thought I might be like little spark electricity that fires in our brains millions of time every second. I might be a single spark in another beings brain that died, I am that infinite millisecond between life and death in some beings brain process.<br />This was a solid peak of 4 hours, not the up and down peak over time, a solid peak and total ego death for close to 4 hours at least.<br />For the entire time I was unaware of my surroundings.<br />Slowly&nbsp; come out of it, you started to rebuild myself, like every atom is slowly put back in place but after being rebuild like that you are in awe and life changing. <br />Still strong visuals and I remember my name, what a tshirt is and shapes and time a re still twisting but I am aware of surroundings,<br />Road the rest out with a cone and some NOS, only little bits. <br />Had some xanax and relexed, had bit more as day broke, and slept.<br />I think this chemical is superior to lsd, in visuals and complete ego death and rebuilding soul, unbelievable but you cant eat as many tabs as you like with lsd.

				@OP<br /><br />First ask yourself why you want that once in a lifetime trip. Life isn&#039;t about getting deep spiritual insights or having that once in a lifetime trip, it&#039;s about living and enjoying every moment. What if that once in lifetime trip takes just that away from you? This why my advice is to check your motives first, and if you still want to do it (because it is definitively a part of your way) then I&#039;d recommend LSD or DMT. ;)

This is based off of 10+ trips on each and a bit of personal preference.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My girlfriend gave me the best line I have ever heard on the difference between them: <br /><br />&quot;ACID IS SCIENCE FICTION. SHROOMS ARE FANTASY.&quot;<br /><br />Having tried both more than once now, I get it. Both feel pretty similar to me when they&#039;re coming on: I feel dizzy, then absent-minded and silly, with kaleidoscopic closed-eye visuals and heightened tactile awareness.&nbsp; (Sex during the first half of a trip? Awesome.) Both give me that &quot;opening up&quot; connectedness feeling. The major difference isn&#039;t the sensations, it&#039;s the mental focus.<br /><br />LSD tends to be a more left-brain, more &#039;analytical&#039; experience for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about everything as I experience it.&nbsp; Ordinary things seem weirder, more otherworldly, and more vivid.&nbsp; I&#039;m not unemotional, but my emotions seem like just more shiny toys to poke at or play with.&nbsp; I see them as one component of an interesting system.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never come close to the fabled &#039;ego death&#039; on LSD.&nbsp; Instead, my sense of self remains intact but mutable.&nbsp; I can temporarily redefine myself, either deliberately or just by letting my setting transform me.&nbsp; On my last trip, I got jealous of my girlfriend&#039;s more vivid experiences and hippie mindset, so I just _became_ her for a while.&nbsp; I thought and acted like her, and experienced what her body was feeling as I fingered her. Later I tried being several other women, and had multiple female orgasms as she played with my cock.&nbsp; (That experience alone will make me always grateful to acid!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Mushrooms are a more right-brain, more &#039;organic&#039; experience.&nbsp; Ordinary things seem more intensely themselves, more animistic, rather than more alien.&nbsp; I find myself wanting to _feel_ things rather than think about them; my emotions tend to fill my entire conscious experience, and sometimes I&#039;ve actually been able to stop thinking for brief periods.&nbsp; Sensations are heightened but feel detached from their causes.&nbsp; If I go into my own head I come closer to losing myself, experiencing that ego death.&nbsp; On one shroom trip I told my other girlfriend about that feeling and connected it to Buddhism.&nbsp; She had once been a theology student and started to give me a contrary viewpoint; I had to ask her to stop and tell me later, because I suddenly felt vulnerable to having core beliefs rewritten or simply erased.&nbsp; (Some might claim that&#039;s desirable for ego death, but it would have been the wrong reason.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found that good pot in the middle of a shroom trip can &quot;unlock&quot; it and make a weaker trip into a stronger one.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get that effect with LSD; getting high on acid isn&#039;t bad, but it just feels like I&#039;m having two different drug trips at the same time.<br /><br /><br />I know this is all idiosyncratic and everyone&#039;s going to have different trips for different reasons.&nbsp; But I still think it&#039;s a good rule of thumb.&nbsp; &quot;Acid: science fiction; shrooms: fantasy.&quot;&nbsp; If your idea of an amazing trip is alien weirdness, LSD&#039;s a fine molecule.&nbsp; If it&#039;s inward magic you want, try the fungus straight out of the earth.<br />

				I definitely vote for DMT if you haven&#039;t tried it yet, along with DMT-containing stuff DiMiTriSpice sells, like pharmahuyasca and changa :) If you have tried DMT, then mix and match it with some E, LSD, etc. I&#039;ve heard 2C-I and its relatives are also pretty great. Just be careful and take it slow, don&#039;t fry your brain. Better safe than sorry :)

				Good choice, but I&#039;m a little off put at the way you seem to treat DMT. It is unlike any other psychedelic out there, and I wouldn&#039;t consider it a &#039;trip&#039; per se. Shrooms and Acid are more of a trip. DMT is a completely different beast. Treat it with respect and be prepared, and the spice will offer you more than you can imagine. Spirituality and DMT go hand in hand.

The technique will actually take you a while to get down, so get at least a G. Vaporizing is the best way, but you need an effective one. Don&#039;t make a lightbulb vape and expect to breakthrough. The sandwich method is alright. Take some herb (preferably not weed as it effects the experience) like mint or parsley, as they are generally mild. Either sandwich the DMT, or put it on top and charge it by melting it with a little heat from your lighter, and smoke away. Hold your hits for 15-20 seconds to get the most out of it. Take 3 BIG hits and I mean BIG, because smoking is a very inefficient way of dosing with the DMT. After the 2nd hit, you will feel very overwhelmed, and you will most likely want to stop, but keep going. I like to take the biggest toke on the 3rd hit and watch the smoke go through my pipe, until I don&#039;t understand what my pipe and smoke actually are, and I breakthrough.<br /><br />I find that doing it outside tends to not only potentiate the experience, but alleviate some of the nerves that may or may not go along with it. Again, treat the spice with utmost respect, because she WILL blow your mind to the ends of hyperspace if you aren&#039;t prepared. Well, even if you are prepared you&#039;ll still be blown away. Reflection is also the most integral part of the experience. If you look at it as simply a trip, the experience is meaningless. Just like dreams with your own indigenous DMT, you can and should attempt to reflect and attempt to understand upon what you saw/felt/experienced as there are very deep meaningful messages to be gained from the spice. If you are not Spiritual or introspective, then you will have a very difficult time wrapping your head around the whole thing, let along attempting to decrypt it all.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that the main thing separating DMT and other psychedelics, is the awareness and meeting of inter-dimensional entities of various origins. My first breakthrough I encountered the self-transforming inter-dimensional elves which began to speak to me in syllabic tongues that I could not even begin to understand. Although I did feel a great sense of knowledge, power, and most importantly Love from these entities, I know that there is more that they were trying to tell me, but wonderment and amazement got the best of me.<br /><br />Your first breakthrough will be powerful and mind-blowing. But it is only the beginning.

				With smoked doses, you generally want to double what you would normally use in the GVG or other similar vaporizers. I&#039;d say start at 100-125mg and work your way up from there. I generally like to start off with around 150-200mg, because that amount will add up to 3 big consecutive hits, and then some.<br /><br />You could try wrapping it, but I would recommend you use a dried out herb. Easier for combustion, and easier for the DMT to bind to it.

				Exactly how accurate do i have to have this? Usually when measuring doses I use a crude method of forming a long, even line, measure, and divide by whatever. For one gram I&#039;d divide by 10.

I&#039;ve eyeballed it everytime thus far, and all I take is my scooper, and pick up enough spice that I deem necessary to breakthrough.

				I&#039;m going to go against what everyone else here has said and give a (hopefully) condensed version of the trip my partner and I experienced on 2CB (thank you IVORY!). Until we had this trip I often scoffed at the notion of being somewhere else while tripping on acid or 2CB and up to this point have only experienced visual and auditory warping and once on a ~250mic acid trip I had a fleeting feeling of another presence in the room besides my partner and I.<br /><br />However the trip that we both experienced has literally changed the course of both of our lives. I&#039;m not usually a person that falls to whimsical notions as I&#039;m very analytical and grounded although my gf is an artist and letting her imagination run away with her is as simple as blinking is for me.<br /><br />Firstly a few points on our Set and Setting as I believe these were crucial:<br />- We have both been binging heavily on meth for the last 4 nights / 5 days and have maybe had 8 hours sleep during this time between the 2 of us... admittedly our binging is quite tame comparatively, however we are not normally heavy meth users and putting 1.5g through the pipe and some hot rails over this time certainly was our record. No shadow people, but the hair on my arms and legs was dancing and my gf had plenty of little dancing visitors adorning every straight line she could see in our apartment. Mind you these were friendly visitors and she was not scared of them. That day we just received Ivory&#039;s 2CB and we were itching to try it and once the 2CB took over, all of these little hallucinations disappeared.<br />- We have had a rocky r/s over the last few years and we were both wary of being hurt and also hurting the other person again<br />- Our previous psychonaut experiences included 4 acid trips and we had taken pills containing what we thought was a decent amount of 2CB a few times. So all in all, not very experienced...<br /><br />Each of us dropped a cap with 20mg of the 2CB, put the music on and relaxed on the couch expecting a nice visual trip, similar to an average acid dose followed by a heightened sexual push which is what we remember from the pills... Man, did we underestimate this amazing substance and the power of our minds!<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to do a minute by minute trip report, but this was the gist of it:<br />20 minutes after dropping the caps we both started to feel &quot;something&quot;, following which the room commenced its fall into distortion land. Things were spinning around, I experienced a bit of motion sickness which I usually get on the crazier rides at amusement parks. We had a music visualisation playing on the big TV in front of us and often certain motions on the TV created a mirrored reaction inside my head - very hard to explain but if there was a texture spinning around, I felt like the brain inside my head was spinning on its axis!<br />That was nothing however... about an hour into the trip my gf was convinced that the open balcony glass door was in fact an open door of an airplane and we were about to go skydiving! I wasn&#039;t quite seeing it, so freaked out that she might get the idea to jump out, I crawled (walking was out of the question) and closed the door.... <br /><br />What proceeded next however is something that was akin to an Epic romantic movie saga, in some ways similar to the movie &quot;The Fountain&quot; however a thousand times more epic and with a happy ending... With an ever increasing speed and frequency, and without the ability to control these, my gf started jumping into her own trips - most of the time we were seated on the couch in the same position, however in her mind she would be in a jungle, in space, walking around in a city, etc... A lot of times scary things would happen and while I never felt like I joined any of these trips with her, I could see her emotions real time expressed on her face... at some point I saw her tremor with such fear that even now 2 weeks later, I feel a stab in my heart thinking about it, and I snapped her out of it by pulling her towards me... The trips continued and a few hours later, my gf said that she needed to go to the toilet. We started walking when I saw her sort of freeze and have trouble moving further... thinking nothing of it, I just picked her up in front of me and carried her to the door of the toilet. When I put her down in front of me she was balling her eyes out stronger than I have ever seen anyone cry... I freaked out thinking that there was something scary behind me, and then she said how much she loved me and that I saved her life... Didn&#039;t quite get that at this point... Similar mini-trips, albeit less severe continued for another hour or so with me constantly trying to get her back to the apartment when she looked a bit uncomfortable or scared.<br /><br />Talking about the trip a bit later after we passed the peak revealed to me that over the last 4 or so hours, my gf had literally been in a thousand places and experienced some amazing and also some truly horrifying visions and sensations.. from being terrified at a paralyzing feeling starting at her toes and rising up to take over her body, to flying in space beyond the infinity of her imagination and being terrified at the concept of an infinitely horrific feeling, to what we both believe was the crux of the entire 2CB trip:<br />- the moment I picked her up and carried her to the bathroom where in the space of 3 seconds her emotions went from smiling happy amazement to absolute terror, grief and also realisation of a deeper love and infinite gratitude. While to me I was merely carrying her across several cold tiles on the kitchen floor, in her mind she was in fact standing on a tall cliff edge and had just lost her balance and was starting to plunge to her death when I caught her. So convinced was she by the alternate reality that she started balling her eyes because words were not sufficient to express her love and gratitude to me for literally saving her life.<br /><br />Up until I &quot;saved her life&quot; she was presented with many scenarios of similar danger where in these trips she continuously rejected my help (she has always been reluctant to accept my help or even help from her friends even when she absolutely needed it). After I &quot;saved her life&quot; she then began slowly to accept my help and thus felt like we were able to break through this huge mental barrier that was previous affecting our r/s.<br />After this point, her trips became ones of exploration rather than danger, and each one started off with a scene that was bleak and missing many colours, sometimes shaded in very ominous tones however once she saw me in these trips (although I never actually saw any of these scenes that she as in), the colours and tones immediately took on a very happy and joyous shade and everything became much brighter and life like. It was as if I coloured the world for her and made it a happy place.<br /><br />Our love was very strong before this trip, but we had both reached an epiphany about the nature of our relationship, she was able to break through a very dense barrier and I gained a &quot;purpose&quot; for being in this relationship besides simply being in love. I painted her world and life within it, with me near she saw the world in happy tones, and I was her protector.<br /><br />Talking about this trip after we were back at baseline, I was amazed to realise that every time I remembered a moment at any point in this trip, I had an odd sensation that there was always a 3rd person there. Through more remembering and talking about it, it hit me - the 3rd person was me! Rather, the 3rd person was me looking at the scene of my gf and I...<br /><br />Few other interesting details I remember, such as how often it was hard to tell if the tears on both our faces were real or imagined, seeing my gf pee on the floor before she entered the bathroom, because she was scared she was not gona make it to the toilet (lol I know gross), but then realise that she did not in fact soil my floor, and on and on...<br /><br /><br />I could continue writing for another several paragraphs about this trip, and there are many details about this trip that I have not included, hopefully these details are unnecessary for everyone to understand the significance.<br />This trip has been truly mind blowing on several levels, a real life changer without being cliche about using that terminology, and absolutely nothing like what we expected from 2CB!! Definately thought these sort of experiences could happen on LSD, but not on the Beeees!<br /><br /><br />Apologies for the not so condensed version, however if you want a quick synopsis - 2CB has changed our lives.<br /><br />EDIT - yikes looks a LOT longer here than it did in notepad :s

Probably the best experience I&#039;ve ever had with psychedelics.<br /><br />A few nights later, I brought a friend who wasn&#039;t really experienced with psychedelics, and didn&#039;t have a hint of Spirituality.

This is not a substance meant to be done in groups or a party setting really, because everytime you do it you&#039;re in your own place in hyperspace. It&#039;s not something you come out of laughing and exclaiming how fun it was. It&#039;s something in which you come out of with an entire new appreciation and gratefulness for everything.

My experiences were so powerful, I just came out of them with an entire new appreciation of being, and the joy and Love for life.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not to knock your spiritual convictions, but you seem a bit &#039;holier than thou&#039; about your friend.&nbsp; His experience doesn&#039;t have to be meaningful to you.&nbsp; It was HIS experience.&nbsp; If it made you appreciate life and love so much, why be judgmental of others who got something different out of it?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would recommend you do it on your own for your first time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your point about it not being a party drug is valid, but there are good practical reasons for having a sitter for the harder psychedelics.&nbsp; Physical safety can still be an issue even if the entire trip is internal; and there&#039;s also aftercare to consider.&nbsp; Besides, you said yourself that your own experiences have been better for doing it in good company.<br />

Really got me thinking, now my lifelong dream is to go to space. Didn&#039;t think about tripping during though!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to second the original question - I&#039;ve never done any hallucinogenics but this summer I&#039;ve decided to open the doors of perception. Naturally I&#039;ll go in the shallow end, but we&#039;ve all seen those cliched trips in movies and the like - what is the most full on trip? Anything similar to the cat piss from that South Park episode?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think shrooms are an excellent starting point for hallucinogens.&nbsp; I was always more cautious and didn&#039;t want to go balls out the first go, so I would eat a small amount and from there, could always add more, and usually did :0&nbsp; .&nbsp; Had an awesome experience with good old natural fungi.

				Your best bet is mixing dissociatives and psychedelics. Snort some 200mg of ketamine, wait twelve minutes and then vape 50mg of DMT. You&#039;ll become freaking Godhead for half an hour outside-your-head time, which means about four hundred years inside-your-head time.<br /><br />Fuck, it&#039;s been over two years since last I did that. Time to get my bitcoins ready and arrange a date with Kate and Dimitri.
