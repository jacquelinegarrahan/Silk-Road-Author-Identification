				Dear forum-users,<br /><br />I myself am new to SR, just placed my first couple of orders...<br />Now I&#039;m looking to stock for some MDA for a big party I have january next year... Found out DB&#039;s is real solid stuff, so I&#039;ll be ordering as soon as I have my BTC...<br />My question is rather how to dose... I have some experience with mdma (taken as pills, green apples not from SR, proper dutch shit), but in my experience the mdma doesn&#039;t last long enough for the entire party... I usually take 1 pill just before I enter so it kicks in when I&#039;m past security and ready to party... and then 2,5-3,5 hrs later I&#039;d take another half to keep me going.<br />After doing some research I found that dosages of MDA are pretty similar overall... So I was thinking about taking 150mg in gelcaps, then after 3 or so hrs taking another 75mg...<br />I&#039;d like to know your thoughts on this, is it too much? does MDA last longer then MDMA? Or is it just about right?

Be prepared for some strong hallucinations and less empathic feelings compared to mdma. If you don&#039;t have any real tolerance to mdma I suggest between 1,3 and 1,7 mg MDA per kg bodyweight to be safe. Just let it come up, you can always take a small redose.... You can get pretty sick of MDA if you take too much and it is more toxic to your brain compared to mdma.<br /><br />It works a bit longer too. The hangover seems to be rougher although I don&#039;t speak on personal experience on that point since I&#039;m in my 30&#039;s now and last time I did MDA I was about 19 years old.. Can&#039;t remember if it was a nastier hangover compared too mdma..

				Two weeks ago I parachuted what I believe was around 200mg of MDA (some of that was snorted).<br /><br />I had a big hangover the next day, I wasn&#039;t feeling bad though, just had a heavy body load.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Last night I did 100mg, parachuted, and it was very easy on me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Had a good time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Started around 6pm and went to bed around 3:30am, no problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: I had smoked half a joint around 2:30am to help me land the plane, and it worked well.

				Its crazy that some people like this stuff. I mean its not all that bad but it doesnt share alot of similarities with MDMA. <br /><br />If I was you I would pick up some of those cheap harleys from streetpharm like $6.50 each and bring them 2 the party.

				MDA and MDMA are quite different drugs. I&#039;m not an neuroscience expert (so correct me if i&#039;m wrong) but the difference are as follows :<br /><br />The thing is MDA hits the 5ht2b receptors harder then MDMA... i.e. it stimulates the serotonin more - so its a harder rush (not that it noticeable to me) thus depletes serotonin more then MDMA. Notice as well MDA has stimulation on 5ht1a and 5ht2c which is what LSD works on, but not 5ht2a which is a key ingredient LSD&#039;s visual trips.<br /><br />MDA does not touch the Muscarinic receptors. The M receptors I dont know a lot about - but wikki seems to indicate this has to do with muscle and gland function, which im guessing is the touch sensation that MDMA has - also impairs motor function. This is why ppl seem to prefer MDA for dancing and stuff less motor skill impairment, but you lose out on hugs.<br /><br />Really they are quite different.... i think the stimulation of the 5ht2c receptor in MDA is what causes some hangover issues. Higher effect on 5ht2b I think means you what to dose it lower then MDMA.<br /><br /><br />MDA: 4.00 5ht2b, 3.60 Alpha2C, 3.12 Alpha2B, 2.74 Alpha2A, 2.41 5ht7, 2.38 5ht1a, 2.15 5ht2c; <br />0.00: 5ht2a, 5ht1e, 5ht1d, D1, D2, D3, D4, 5ht1b, Alpha1A, Alpha1B, 5ht5a, 5ht6, D5, Beta1, Beta2, SERT, DAT, NET, Imidazoline1, CB2, H2, M5, KOR, M2, CB1; ND: M1, M3, Sigma1, MOR, H1, Sigma2, DOR, M4, Ca+Channel, NMDA<br /><br />MDMA: 4.00 Imidazoline1, 3.64 5ht2b, 3.26 Ca+Channel, 3.21 Alpha2C, 3.09 Alpha2B, 3.07 M3, 2.94 Alpha2A, 2.54 M5, 2.43 M4; <br />0.00: 5ht2c, 5ht1d, D2, 5ht1e, 5ht1a, 5ht2a, Alpha1A, Alpha1B, 5ht5a, 5ht6, 5ht7, D1, Beta2, SERT, DAT, NET, 5ht1b, H1, H2, D3, KOR, Beta1, M1, M2, D5, D4, CB1, NMDA, MOR; ND: DOR, Sigma2, CB2, Sigma1<br />

				Does anyone know at what temperature MDA is destroyed? More specifically I am wondering if MDA can be vaporized without killing it, but an answer to either question would be fine lol!

				MDA.HCl and MDMA.HCl will be destroyed before they reach their boiling point. You can try, and some of it will make it into your lungs but the majority will just turn into tar.

				Although its subjective info I have found ~100mg of mda (approx 170 lb body weight) to be a good enough dose, if you get quality that should be enough for some colorful CEV&#039;s, enhanced enjoyment of music and increased tactile sensations. Plus I can get it up on MDA lol not so much on MDMA so it has that going for it.&nbsp; :P<br />As a suggestion I often enjoy dosing initially mda then redosing +1.5 - 2 hrs with ~80mg mdma, because the mda comedown definitely feels worse and this seems to take the edge off.

				I cannot find where I read this but.... at about 1mg/kg dose of mdma actually has the opposite effect and promotes serotonin uptake. So maybe 70 mg of mdma at the end or the next day of taking mda could actually be good for you. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone can confirm that ?

				Sounds like something I would tell myself in the days of me rolling two days in a row.<br /><br />Very interesting if true.. I just think you are going to be pretty 8up regardless if you go 2 in a row.

				Thanks a lot to UeXtation for that post, very helpful.<br />And indeed thanks to you all for helping out! Think I&#039;ll take 100mg of the stuff, then after a few hours take half an E-pill (good for like 70-80mg MDMA for as far as I know)...<br />Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do a lot of MDA in the future as it is indeed more expensive then pills are, but I&#039;m just very curious what it&#039;ll do, no drugs are really the same, and I&#039;m just wondering how MDA will effect me...<br />I will be doing some more research on mda though, as I still have more then a month before the party...
