				Someone asked me about this, <br />so I thought I might just as well make a post out of it... <br /><br />How I snort ketamine...<br /><br />First of all: always keep in mind your health and thus apply all good hygienic practices (such as: don&#039;t use money to snort but use straws or roll a clean piece of paper, have a straw for everybody and never share them, don&#039;t put your product on a dirty CD/DVD cover but on a clean surface such as a mirror or a kitchen plate, never lick the mirror or go over it with a wet finger unless you are the only one to use that mirror, regularly clean your mirror with cleaning products, clean your nose with nasal water at the end of your evening and also keep in mind common good health practices such as enough sleep, healthy food, physical exercise and so on… ).<br /><br />Then specifically for ketamine, you should first of all apply it on a dry surface. If the surface is wet or moist, you&#039;ll lose a lot of product due to that. I mostly use a mirror that I slightly warmed with my lighter, or a clean kitchen plate that I just dried with a tissue. <br />Put some product on the dry surface and then crush it. Ketamine doesn&#039;t have to be cut like cocaine or speed, it has to be crushed. The more it&#039;s crushed, the better it is. For this purpose I put the product on the clean, dry surface and cover it with a little piece of paper (not cigaret-paper but something stronger and thicker), then I crush the K by pressing as hard as I can with my lighter over the paper while making some circular movements. <br />After doing that you take the paper gently away (some powder might stick to it, try not to waste that) and what lies there is finely crushed ketamine powder. <br /><br />Once you have the crushed powder, you make your lines. <br />Never start to big, especially with a new product. If you take too much you&#039;ll just feel bad or even be knocked-out for a few hours (this is kind of a comatic sleep where you can&#039;t walk, think or do whatever and you&#039;ll have no memories of it and it&#039;s something totally different than as K-holing). <br />Start with a small dose and build up. I like to take a new line every 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the product. I just wait until I feel the effect of the previous line diminishing and then (if coordination is good enough again) I&#039;ll take my next line. <br /><br />Often after 3 to 4 lines I&#039;ll have reached the state of mind I wanted to reach and then I&#039;ll stop for the night. <br />If you want to K-hole I&#039;d advise you to first get to know the product and then do some research on quantities and ways to consume… This post is meant for K-newbies so I decided not to discuss K-holing (other posts have already lots of good information on the subject). Just keep in mind that spending 5 to 6 hours knocked-out is not what I&#039;d call &quot;having a good time&quot;. <br /><br />Beware that your body will very quickly build up his tolerance to this product. You&#039;ll quickly need much bigger lines (or more of them) than when you started… <br />Also, if you use with someone who is accustomed to the product, don&#039;t try to snort the same quantities as him/her; just build up your own portions starting small (small is probably a line 2cm long and 2 or 3 mm wide).<br /><br />The experience can be very enjoyable, <br />use it wisely and without exaggeration and you&#039;ll get the most out of it. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />RaFaeL5<br /><br /><br />Edit: K - 5 possible effects.<br />I didn&#039;t write about this in the original OP, but I think this is a &quot;detail&quot; that also deserves to be discussed: the different possible effects of K. <br />There are 5: no effect, stimulant, psychedelic/drunk, K-hole, anesthetic. <br /><br />The first effect &quot;none&quot; is quite easy: if you don&#039;t take enough, you want feel a thing - but the &quot;problem&quot; here is that tolerance for K evolves very quickly and it takes about 3 years to get back to baseline. So, if you use K a few times in a week you&#039;ll soon be using much more K to feel some effect (or the same effect as a week ago). <br /><br />The second effect &quot;stimulant&quot; is when you take a small portion of K, preferably at regular intervals of time (every hour or so). The K will then work a bit like cocaine or amphetamines: you&#039;ll stay awake, be focussed, have no hunger, be quite social, … the problem with this use is that it requires to take small amounts at regular intervals of time, thus your tolerance towards the product will grow very quickly… to my opinion this is maybe the &quot;worse&quot; way to use K (the most addictive), but it&#039;s the best way to use it for social interaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />The third effect &quot;psychedelic/drunk&quot; is when you take a &quot;normal&quot; portion (normal means: adapted to your tolerance). In this phase the effects of K will vary depending on what type of K you have: racemic or S-isomer. The racemic will give you more of a &quot;drunken&quot; feeling, whereas the S-isomer will give you more psychedelic experiences. This is the effect that I prefer - I can still be active, but meanwhile I&#039;m very poetic, write a lot, have insights on stuff I&#039;ve been thinking about, … It lasts for about 20 minutes (from +15 minutes after insuflating or +20 to +35 or +40). This can still be used &quot;socially&quot;, but in this phase people will probably realize that you&#039;re not behaving as you normally do. <br /><br />The fourth effect &quot;K-holing&quot; is the most intense way to use K. Many people think you can only reach this phase when shooting K, but I know from experience that you can also go into that hole when snorting K - it just demands some willingness. If you want to reach the K-hole, you&#039;ll need good quality K and then you&#039;ll have to insuflate &quot;normal&quot; lines (or a bit bigger than that) about every 5 minutes until you &quot;take off&quot;. It&#039;s not really nice to have to keep on snorting when you&#039;re enjoying your state of being and sometimes it&#039;s a bit complicated to coordinate your movements - but if you prepare decently and have some practice you&#039;ll probably reach the K-hole… This state can last up to almost 1 hour, but most of the time you&#039;ll only be &quot;flying&quot; for half an hour or so. If attempting to do this, don&#039;t do it with too many people around you - preferably only 1 &quot;sitter&quot;. Some people think this is the nicest way of consuming ketamine - that&#039;s not my opinion…but, that&#039;s just a personal opinion and you probably have your own. <br /><br />The fifth effect &quot;anesthetic&quot; is NOT for recreational use, not even for experienced users/shooters - this is for medical treatment in a medical environment. Don&#039;t attempt to do this yourself. And anyway, there&#039;s no fun in it… <br /><br /><br /><br />When snorting K it&#039;s quite a safe drugs. You&#039;ll not be able to snort anymore before having an OD or you would have to snort such huge portions that you&#039;d probably wouldn&#039;t be able to snort it all at once. <br />When shooting K the risk is different. OD&#039;ing on K isn&#039;t common, but physical harm is a real possibility (kidneys and bladder!). <br />When eaten K (yes, K can be &quot;eaten&quot;, parachuted or in a capsule) there are more risks than when snorting (you also need more product because a lot of the K will have been broken down in your stomach before being picked up in your bloodstream), but less risk than when shooting. I haven&#039;t tried to use K in this way (yet, but I intent to soon) but the portion seems to be 3x the nasal quantity for a good result. <br /><br /><br />THIS LAST PARAGRAPH IS HAVING LOTS OF COMMENTS (see further in the thread) - I&#039;LL KEEP IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE DISCUSSION BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF INFORMATION THAT SEEM TO PROVE THAT I WAS WRONG WHEN WRITING IT...<br />Beware that taking too much K can cause harm to your body (the use of 0.5 gram in 24h gives you a statistical chance of 1 on 5 or so to cause permanent harm; the use of 1g in 24h gives you a statistical chance of almost 100% to cause permanent harm (those are not my numbers so if I&#039;m mistaking do PM me about it please so that I can adapt it). <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />RE-EDIT:<br />when taking K do remember to drink plenty of water (K is a diuretic and digesting the K will take lots of water from your cells)... and, I know many of you do but, try to not mix K with alcohol. Mixing any drug with alcohol always makes it way more toxic than it c/would be without... take the K for the effects of the K, don&#039;t take the K so that you can drink more...

				I always try to stress the crushing up of the crystals because my friends and I used to just do keybumps of the whole crystals and I would always wake up with scabs in my nose that would last for weeks...its also much more predictable how it will hit you when you crush it up real good ;)

				Great post RaFaeL5!<br /><br />Regarding Ketamine though, I would highly recommend injecting it rather then snorting it.<br /><br />It makes for a far superior journey in every way.<br /><br />IM with a U100 1cc Microfine insulin syringe is best. Short needle, as thin as a hair - into the shoulder muscle - very easy.<br /><br />Will allow you to take a larger dose, avoids the taste, the burn and the acrid drip down the throat - and gives the K a cooler, smoother and more fluid signature.<br /><br />I resisted at first cause needles really weren&#039;t my thing - but after my first experience I would never go back to snorting.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d add that in :)<br /><br />BG

				I have always sniffed k and never had any trouble to k hole. I usually just start with a small line and work my way up. I am definitely a binge user of ketamine, by the end of a binge I am snorting half foot long lines and coughing out clouds of powder. K holing is definitely the goal to aim for IMO. Crushing ketamine is super super super important if you don&#039;t want to seriously fuck up your nose. Ketamine was the first drug I regularly sniffed and the first time I got it I didn&#039;t realize the importance of crushing it. It doesn&#039;t really hurt to sniff it when it is not crushed, but trust me it doesn&#039;t take long for it to royally fuck up your nose and if it does it takes ages to heal.

I have used multiple grams of ketamine in a single day and I don&#039;t think that it caused me any permanent harm. I have gotten K-pains and they are god damn horrible and feel like being shot in the gut or having an ice pick shoved up your dick, but they go away with no recognizable lasting harm. I know a lot of ketamine users who easily go through a few grams a day and none of them are likely to report that they have suffered from permanent harm. There is some evidence that some people can possibly have bladder damage caused by ketamine binges, although it isn&#039;t clear if this is directly related to ketamine or to impurities in clandestinely synthesized batches. Of course there is the risk of Olneys lesions as well but those are inconclusive in humans. Ketamine certainly greatly impairs all forms of memory, particularly it massively impairs visual-spatial memory due to inhibition of the hippocampus, but I have never seen any evidence that this is permanent. In some cases ketamine induced memory impairment is long lasting, but I don&#039;t believe I have ever heard of it lasting longer than one year. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The first large-scale, longitudinal study of ketamine users found that frequent ketamine users (at least 4 days/week, averaging 20 days/month) had increased depression and impaired memory by several measures, including verbal, short-term memory and visual memory. However, infrequent (1–4 days/month, averaging 3.25 days/month) ketamine users and former ketamine users were not found to differ from controls in memory, attention and psychological well-being tests. This suggests the infrequent use of ketamine does not cause cognitive deficits, and that any deficits that might occur may be reversible when ketamine use is discontinued. However, abstinent, frequent, and infrequent users all scored higher than controls on a test of delusional symptoms.[32]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think the trick with ketamine is not so much limiting how much you use in a single day, but rather in not using for many consecutive days in a row. In a study using monkeys, cell death in the brain was noted in monkeys administered injections daily over a period of six months, but not in monkeys administered equal dosages over a period of one month. This indicates that a dosage of ketamine that will not cause permanent brain damage after a single administration could still lead to permanent brain damage if it is repeatedly administered over a prolonged period. I don&#039;t think that using a gram in a single day (that is k holing about 5 times for somebody who weighs 200 pounds) is going to cause any long term damage, but maybe if you use a gram a day for 6 months in a row it will.

				I really don&#039;t agree with a lot of the explanations of the five stages.&nbsp; More than anything, you make it seem like it is hard to reach a K hole via snorting and that you must repeat lines over and over until this happens.<br /><br />I can say that I have K-Holed many many times in my life by snorting a single line of K.&nbsp; And yes I know what a K-Hole is and this is actually a much preferred state for me than any of the other stages.<br /><br />To each their own but this is not the way I would recommend others to start taking K.<br /><br />Plus, what is this nonsense about 3 years of tolerance?&nbsp; Where on earth did you get this from?<br /><br />And the permanent damage amounts/timeframes seem like they were pulled out of thin air as well.<br />

				There was a study with mice that showed &quot;permanent&quot; damage starting after about one month of daily dosing and getting consistently worse after 6 months of daily dosing. Of course by &quot;permanent&quot; damage, they mean that immediately after 6 months of daily injections of ketamine they gave them a few hours to metabolize the last dose given, and then the mice performed worse than control mice. They did not reevaluate the mice after some time had passed after the cessation of injections, but rather killed them and counted the neurons present in their brains, which revealed that no physical brain damage had taken place (ketamine group and control group had no statistically significant difference in the amount of neurons). They also noted significant weakening of the bladder walls in the ketamine group.

				@hoobydoobydoo: lots of info is coming from documentaries that I saw in the last months, most of them were listed on the forum (there are different theads with compilations of documentaries). I didn&#039;t keep all of them, but if you want to I can look for the names of those that I kept. <br /><br />Regarding you K-hole experience: I&#039;m glad for you that it goes that easy, but my experience (and the people around me) proves that K-holing is, in most cases not &quot;that easy&quot;. But, again, better for you if you have an easy K-hole experience each time and again. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t pull out anything of thin air myself, but I also did not research all the data I got from those documentaries - some might be bullocks, I&#039;m aware of that...but that&#039;s why we have a forum: to share information and, if necessary, correct it. Thank you for adding your point of view to this discussion. <br /><br />@kmfewm: thx 4 the info!

				Speaking to special K users they always plan ahead and ensure the environment they are goin to use in is safe <br /><br />Start with a small dose and see how it affects you<br /><br />Always make sure you are in a safe and comfortable place before you inject ketamine ie. Lying or sitting down away from potential hazards in a safe environment<br /><br />Have a “trip sitter” on hand: an experienced peer who is not using at the same time<br /><br />Avoid eating for at least 90 minutes before use (ketamine suppresses gag reflex)<br /><br />Can produce racing heart and breathing difficulties (apnea)<br /><br />Nausea/vomitting<br /><br />Involuntary movements causing injury, sometimes seizures<br /><br />Mixing with other drugs or too large a&nbsp; dose can cause negative experience<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have used both only intranasally so I comment on IV but Ketamine and opiates really can&#039;t be compared.&nbsp; There is a body buzz that I would probably compare more to benzo&#039;s than opiates but Ketamine has a major major mental element that nothing can really prepare you for.&nbsp; Its kinda like you are drunk and everything is just weird.&nbsp; You can&#039;t really put your finger on it.&nbsp; Just weird.&nbsp; If you do enough then you feel all floaty and your brain starts making all these strange connections.&nbsp; Like say for instance you are walking along and you find a ball in the park.&nbsp; Your sober mind would think &quot;hey somebody lost their ball&quot; but your ketabrain has a tendency to think more along the lines of like &quot;wow somebody or something put this ball here just for me to play with.&quot; Things that are just coincidences seem like they are that way for a specific reason. I believe the term is egocentrism.&nbsp; If you do a lot then you just kinda leave your body completely and may think you have &quot;died.&quot;&nbsp; Then there is the illusive K-Hole which I can only describe as feeling as though you are flying through the visualizer tunnels like they had when you listened to music on the original Xbox.&nbsp; Lol this post probably didn&#039;t help much.&nbsp; Its hard to describe.

				Using Ketamine during an LSD trip is just amazing for anyone who hasn&#039;t tried it.<br /><br />Instead of having one lucid dream I tend to be able to experience multiple lucid dreams all at once because of the way LSD causes thought divergence.&nbsp; I have also been able to completely control the visuals in front of me to the point where a blank TV becomes a drawing board and whatever I want appears on it.<br /><br />Ketamine and LSD have a very weird but very strong synergy that I highly recommend everyone interested in these drugs try at least once during their life.

Of course by &quot;permanent&quot; damage, they mean that immediately after 6 months of daily injections of ketamine they gave them a few hours to metabolize the last dose given, and then the mice performed worse than control mice. They did not reevaluate the mice after some time had passed after the cessation of injections, but rather killed them and counted the neurons present in their brains, which revealed that no physical brain damage had taken place (ketamine group and control group had no statistically significant difference in the amount of neurons).

				Something I have to contribute to this discussion:<br /><br />Sometimes it seems as if ketamine only works when it &quot;wants&quot; to.&nbsp; A couple weeks ago, a friend and I did a couple of rails.&nbsp; It was nothing unusual, and we hadn&#039;t been binging all night.&nbsp; Just a standard &quot;Hey let&#039;s do some K&quot;.&nbsp; We weren&#039;t on anything else.<br /><br />It was a good thing we were sitting down (Indian-style), because as soon as we did the ketamine, our bodies seemed to get sucked into this vortex, this current. We started gyrating at the waist in time, together.&nbsp; When my body would go forward, his would go forward; when I went backwards, he went backwards.&nbsp; We couldn&#039;t help it.&nbsp; It was as if we were sucked into some kind of vast ocean that we had to tread - but something that I knew how to do, somehow.&nbsp; The thing about it was that it was happening to us simultaneously, and we were experiencing the same physical phenomena at the same time.&nbsp; This lasted for about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; Then it stopped, quite suddenly - for both of us, at the same time.&nbsp; It went away as suddenly as it came on.&nbsp; As soon as our torsos stopped gyrating, we looked at each other and were like, &quot;WTF?&quot;<br /><br />For the record, our tolerances and experiences with ketamine are far different - my tolerance is enormous, his is much smaller.&nbsp; He did a fraction of the amount of ketamine that I had ingested.&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#039;t the first time I had done this particular batch of K, nor was it the most I&#039;d done.&nbsp; I was only expecting to get high.<br /><br />In all my years of doing ketamine, I have had maybe 4-5 experiences like this where I felt I was sucked into some kind of universal current.&nbsp; But never can I remember sharing it with someone else - the timing, our bodily actions were in locked in shape.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we looked completely insane, gyrating like a couple of swamis.<br /><br />Anyone ever experience anything like this?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some life-changing experiences on ketamine, but I&#039;m still utterly flabbergasted by this one.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like tripping, where you&#039;re in your own head, seeing your own shit.&nbsp; This was...shared.&nbsp; Just freakin&#039; odd.<br /><br />

				Thank you Kittykitty for bringing it to my attention to drink lots of water while using K.<br /><br />I have the urge to drink a lot of water when insuflating K and I think this is both because K is partially a diuretica but also because the metabolisme of K in your body takes lots of water out of it... <br /><br />Nice one!

				Hey guys its been a while since I&#039;ve taken Ketamine, missed it actually! In my previous town it was easy to get some but it was expensive and I&#039;m pretty sure it was cut most of the time... But I never knew the amount I was buying for, we&#039;d get small bags at 18-20$ (after conversion)..<br /><br />How long could 0.5g last me if I were to get some? My tolerance now is probably newbie level and I&#039;d like to know how many K sessions it could last me? Just enough to &#039;jam out&#039; (Not K-hole but just feel great sitting down staring at nothing). I loved taking it after popping ecstasy, just to kill the waiting time. Too bad Now I don&#039;t have any local dealers

				Thanks kitty :) I&#039;ve only got so so amount left of btc and I can either get .5g of ketamine or 1g of Mephedrone (havent tried it before)... and I kind of want to pick whichever lasts long or is more worth my money... I&#039;ll probably go for the meph but I miss ketamine a lot, and I think .5 would only last me either 2 sessions, maximum (i doubt) 3.. :S

				Great info from OP, and lots of usefull ket info here thanks all!<br /><br />I would like to add a few of my own hints and experience with this crazy chemical for any interest there may be..<br /><br />Crushing:&nbsp; I use two polished 4mm stainless steel plates to crush my ket (and MDMA which I like to snort too) these are about 2&quot;x3&quot; (50x75mm) and the flat polished surface gives an amazing fine grind when the crystals are pressed between them with a bit of sliding and turning, then you can cut the lines out on one plate with a card.&nbsp; The finer the powder the better the hit, as the peak plasma concentration is reached quicker, never as quick as IM of course but much better than coarse powder or crystals (crystal keybumps are for idiots...a mates nose was destroyed by them).&nbsp; I made the plates myself BTW, also if you keep then in your pocket they are nice and warm and dry.&nbsp; This has made a big difference to my ket fun recently.<br /><br />K Holes:&nbsp; I take ket mostly not to k-hole but have done several times.&nbsp; I find that it is easier when I have been high on something else (usually MDMA or Pills) earlier and am coming down, I like ket as landing gear!&nbsp; I will do a few quick bumps in succession and then rail a fat line, works for me, needs about 200-250mg in total to get me in a hole if its fine enough.&nbsp; Never tried IM<br /><br />Source:&nbsp; I have had some excellent K off SR but at the moment my fave vendor is K Queen who have always seen me right, really good vendor.<br /><br />Anyway just my little bit ;)<br />

				@Strangelights I agree with RaFaeL5 there is nothing wrong with crushing it all at once except you might get tempted to do it all at once. I always have new spare bags around. I would separate 1/4 of my bag via scale into a new bag and I crush my separated crystals whether its K, MDMA, MDA, or what ever it is by putting the bag with the crystals on a hard surface like a non porous table or tile and I smash it with a lighter once its mostly crushed I flick the bag a little and put it back on the surface of choice and then I roll the lighter over the bag back and forth and flick again until its a very fine powder. Works like a charm. It also doesnt take much work and I rarely have a bag tear on me. It usually only tare after many uses then I transfer to a new bag. Its probably over kill but once I am done with the goodies in that bag I save that bag for the next portion I plan on using. I then place the used bag on the scale and press the tear button I separate the portion I want for the next session, crush, enjoy, repeat. This way I only loose (even though its minimal, thats why I said its over kill) a very small amount of product to one baggie. Instead of a bunch of baggies.<br /><br />

				@RaFaeL5 I hear you. A little trick I picked up... If you pull the bullet apart, take the little part that turns(the part that take the bump from the vial to your nose lets call it the &quot;feeder&quot;) out of the bullet and put it a side. Then grab a drill bit or a sharp exacto knife. Look at the main piece of plastic that holds the feeder, there is a hole that lets the powder of choice from the vial into the &quot;feeder&quot; and either drill it so that it is a bigger hole or use the exacto knife to ream it out into a bigger hole. AND WALLLA You get a slightly bigger bump that fills up with less tapping or flicking of the bullet... Thats a slight upgrade but if your like me and thats still not always enough. I would take 2 or 3 or 4 bullet bumps in a row. That should do the trick.

				hey just wanted to drop in a few comments and a question. <br />I&#039;ve recently fallen back in love with Ket. Had an affair in about 97-99 with it then gave it up until I found it on the road. <br />1. OP&#039;s 5 stages are spot on IMO. I have never enjoyed the K-Hole experience that many do. i hate that disconnect. I float between the Drunk and Stim effects of the drug. This is the most enjoyable. <br />2. Ive found that I am becoming much closer and more honest in my relationship through the use of Ket. However I do find myself having to control the Egocentric qualities of the drug spcifically making grand plans and never carrying them out. <br />3. Ive been a long time cocaine user so snorting is right up my ally. I have found that a mirror and a couple new cards out of a playing card deck really do the trick and allow me to lay out the nights lines nicely and organized. <br /><br />Q<br />has anyone tried mixing Ket and Cocaine? <br />I was with friends the other day. We went for sushi and a few beers. After we ate (very small meals) we had each two 70-80mg lines. a few more beers (maybe 4-5 total each) and we were en route back to his house. upon arrival he broke out another line and suggested we do some ket afterwards. I was a little weary however, FUCK IT why not. I broke out two ket lines about 50mg each. After snorting, I got this real soft Fuzz feeling. Now Im a Weekend Warrior most of the time but this was a new and really nice feeling. I lost that edge I always get using coke and I lost that Talky social interaction crave I get with Ket. It was just simply, nice no real up no real down just content, happy. this is actually a little upsetting. I really liked that feeling and want more. so my question is there any really negative effects (besides obvious, nasal and throat irritaition) to combining the two drugs? <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your advice/ comments.

				that settles this discussion...<br />but, my personal experience shows that &quot;cooking&quot; keta does give you finer crystals in the end...<br />but then again: I never cooked many keta&#039;s and I never tried to do it with Marcel&#039;s... <br /><br />

				Has anyone ever had issues snorting ket in a bullet? It seems that whenever I try to snort the ketamine when it&#039;s in the bullet it shoots to the back of my throat but when I&#039;m snorting lines with an empty pen tube it shoots right into my nose, where I want it. Any thoughts? Why does the bullet have a different end than the pen tube?
