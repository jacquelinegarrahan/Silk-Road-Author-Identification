				I was wanting something to help me to homework. I ordered some 4FA because i seen how so many people end up abusing MDPV. So, which do you think is better for a study aid. Also, i can&#039;t remember where i read this. But, i read about a guy that didn&#039;t redose on MDPV because he had a time release safe. He would get out enough for a bump and the safe would only open every hour. That kinda turned me off to doing MDPV. Has anyone had good experience with this drug? And how about 4FA? Thanks for any information i get. Also please don&#039;t post anything except personal experience. I know how to google and read trip reports of erowid. Tyvm. :)

				With MDPV you are likely to just end up jacking off the whole time. 4FA at smallish doses is a great study aid.

				Fortune has it that I have tried both drugs recreationally and for studying.<br /><br />4-FA has a great mood-boosting aspect to it that can really get you pumped and excited to do stuff. Unfortunately, I find that it gets me over-excited and I&#039;d rather do housework and sing and dance. I have a hard time just sitting still, although I do get more into what I&#039;m focusing on. It really is better suited to be a party drug, honestly.<br /><br />MDPV is more focused but it has a terribly moreish quality to it. I also experience jitters with it. Oh, and it builds up tolerance quickly (although tolerance goes away pretty quickly too). I&#039;m currently using drpvmd&#039;s B grade MDPV to combat my narcolepsy. It lacks most of the euphoria and it&#039;s less potent by weight, so it&#039;s good for a wake-me-up. His A grade is great stuff but it&#039;s too moreish for me to use for any practical day-to-day application.<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t like either for studying. So far, besides the classic prescription study meds, I find ethylphenidate to be decent for studying.

				While I was researching all the different flouronated (sp?) amphetamines, I read that 2-FA was somewhat better for studying than 4-FA.&nbsp; Sadly, I haven&#039;t been able to find a vendor for it.

				I don&#039;t know much about stimulants, but when I have stressful work to do I take about 5mg Valium. Less stress makes work less painful.

				I&#039;d rather put both my nuts in a vice and squeeze them until they pop than ever do MDPV again. I&#039;ve triend it once, hated it. Tried it again, hated it passionately. I hate it so much that I burned it. Fuck that devil shit. <br /><br />Go for the 4-FA, or just buy some fucking amp or meth.
