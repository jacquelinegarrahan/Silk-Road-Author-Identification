				Hello SR,<br /><br />I&#039;m considering getting DMT to try this summer and I just wanted to ask those who truly know, for some tips on a first time.<br /><br />Was gonna get a .5g freebase off Multi Exciter(Vendor, yay/nay?) then just go out into a field on a nice day with some close friends and give it a go, maybe 50-60mg dose to try first.<br /><br />Should I try and really go for it to break through on my first try?<br /><br />Are there any side effects after? I did mushrooms ~2 times a week in very large quantities, I don&#039;t know anyone who ever did as much as I did, half ounce at a time sometimes. After trips that powerful I found myself looking at things differently sometimes, I was always accutely aware of the incredible amount of branches and their intricacy on trees and shiny things reminded me of being on it, etc. etc. These types of perceptions have since resided now that I no longer do mushrooms. Will DMT give you these kinds of perception, mind change, etc?<br /><br />How should I smoke it? People recommend buying a special freebase pipe but is it necessary? Will that enhance the experience at all?<br /><br />anything else I should know?<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				You can make a freebase pipe out of a lightbulb, a freebase pipe is apparently better than a regular pipe for DMT...

				i&#039;m not a fan of a bad vapor pipe. get a -good- vaporizer, learn how to use &amp; build a machine (google dmt + machine; this will need some trials, too), or get smokin&#039; it in the end better ....... ime better a &#039;wasteful&#039;, but well burning joint made of herbs &amp; dmt (eg changa), then a fkced up, not well working shitty vape pipe, which won&#039;t give u a real hit at all ....<br /><br /><br />50 to 60mgs is very high for a first try, when vaporized properly. for a bong/pipe with sandwhich method, still, this amount will blast your ass off.<br />i took as well huge mushroom hits in my life, what you write resonates deeply with my own experience;<br />personally, i am still looking forward to my psilocybe arcana 5.06 trip tomorrow with a smile, <br />but every upcoming dmt experience makes me a bit shiver in my stomach. <br />i don&#039;t know why - the experiences are sometimes way more soft; always they leave me better and with a profit.<br />but it&#039;s just something else.<br />make the experience - <br />it&#039;s worth it. <br /><br /><br />i&#039;d suggest a little bong and sandwhich method, that is some herbs (no psychoactive to start) like peppermint eg, sandwhiching around 20-30mg dmt, <br />or a pipe, but here due to normally lower volume of the bowl already prepared changa/enhanced leaf (changa contains maois, which is sweet but as well not too bad to leave out for a start); to do this, just dissolve some measured dmt in grain alcohol or vodka, put ur herbs (i like peppermint, blue lotus, jasmin and lavender) over it, and let it dry over the course of 2-3 days - voil√°, your dmt-enhanced leaf, perfect for any beginner pipe of a simple joint rolling paper for a easy group experience!<br /><br /><br />dmt, es su mundo, <br />a world on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />enjoy it &lt;3

				Also can you smoke DMT more than once in a sitting? Like if we were all hanging out in said field all day would I be able to trip two or three times over the course of the day?

				Yeah that&#039;s what I was hoping. Was planning on spending a whole day hanging out, drinking and like BBQing and that type of thing but would be nice if we could make a few DMT circles throughout the day. I&#039;m pretty excited, I love psychedelics and, from what I can tell, DMT is the ultimate psychedelic experience.<br /><br />For smoking it I was going to sort of make my own version of &#039;The Machine&#039;. I have an ash catcher for my bong I was going to use, pretty basic I ordered some tubing that I am going put around the part that sits in the bong stem to suck through, then flip the ash catcher upside down so the part the bowl would sit in is upside down, then set the DMT on some steel wool and push that upward into it and heat it indirectly that way through the wool. <br /><br />http://i508.photobucket[DOT]com/albums/s327/beavisisisxtreme/22ffeac4.jpg<br />*Warning clearnet, remove [DOT], insert .*<br /><br />Something like that, only a lot bigger. Imagine a tube on the bent part that goes to your mouth, and then the top part upside down w/ the wool and DMT in it.<br />sound like it would work? <br /><br />Also when people talk about using the machine they are confusing about where you put the DMT. To you melt it to the exposed side and chase it into the bottle or do you put it on the side inside the bottle and heat it indirectly through the wool?

				i never used a machine (i have a glass vaporgenie which is good, used a normal one which worked well too, and smoke changa in joints n pipes if not), but as far as i know, you put the dmt on the exposed side, then gently heat that it melts in. so you don&#039;t have to remove the wool each time, nor sprinkle it through the inhalation hole which might work in the other hand. still i wonder if melting/heating it gently would work good/proper through the glass. <br />anyways, i&#039;m not sure how your selfbuild device would work. honestly i lacked even full imaginary potential when reading your description.&nbsp; it&#039;s definitely to honor that you are so creative here. but i&#039;d suggest you to try it out at least with mini amounts (even when not inhaling or so), to get around the chance being at your outdoor spot at the anticipated bbq, just to find urself unable to enter the realms and dephts of the dmt due to a lacking smoking device. but well, it might work, and i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find your twist here. <br />when i see the fotos of your ash-catcher, i immediately had to think of &#039;the bubbler&#039;, which is maybe worth and of help checking out, too. <br /><br />definitely i have to say, i think you don&#039;t have to expect too less; when you love psychedelics, and you will be around a location that you love (eg as you describe it), it&#039;s definitely possible and you will be able to experience the ultimate psychedelic experience as you say. <br />but wait, the &#039;ultimate&#039; psychedelic experience? i guess we are just scratching surfaces here ....but anyways a fucking great, deep, mindblowing and mindbending experience, a huge, a fascinating,&nbsp; an impressively beautiful, worth wonderful thing! rejuvenating, so philosophical,&nbsp; truly us. and yes, you can repeat it in various cycles. all night long. and all day after. and even if you inhale it after 20 minutes, it will knock your socks off so good that you will rise into eternal bliss with the ease as always. <br />enjoy it brother, have a good one, and much fun on your travels!<br />

				Yeah I think the beauty of the ash catcher, part of what attracts me to it, is that if I can&#039;t get it to vaporise with the machine method I&#039;ll just flip it upside down, take the wool out and put a bowl in and just do the &quot;Sandwich between layers of mint&quot; or whatever spice method. It will still work fine with the tubing on the end. I&#039;ll definitely try chasing the DMT into the wool like you said, with some tiny micro hits to make sure I can work it.<br /><br />I&#039;m really glad you can stagger it like that, I&#039;ve been sitting here planning, writing down all the details, picking my perfect park. Haven&#039;t been this excited for something in forever lol.

Try with 20-30 mg first. You must first learn how to vaporize the DMT correctly so you don&#039;t burn it and understand how you react with it with your body.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161818.msg1151640#msg1151640">Quote from: Churchwarden on May 21, 2013, 08:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should I try and really go for it to break through on my first try?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would advise you to not do it the first time (btw you can breakthrough with 20-30 mg if you vaporize the DMT correctly). While threshold doses (below 20 mg) are usually a waste (because you feel all the &quot;negative&quot; effects without all the positive ones) they will make you understand how to vaporize the DMT correctly. If you go immediately for large doses (as 50/60 mg) you will never know if you wasted a lot DMT, forming a bad habit. You have all the time you need, no point on to hurry. Psychedelics are to be used with calm and determination.<br /><br />Btw a breakthrough dose is between 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg if you smoke correctly all the DMT (0.5/0.6 and above are high doses), so you can calculate that individually without wasting any depending on what you want to do when you have perfected your method. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161818.msg1151640#msg1151640">Quote from: Churchwarden on May 21, 2013, 08:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are there any side effects after? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. After you usually feel euphoric and well. The &quot;side effects&quot; are more in the meantime, as some difficulty on breathing, weight on the chest, high pressure and more rapid heartbeat, but they are very temporary and are most felt at threshold doses. In the higher doses these effects are so fast that they are passed the moment you notice them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161818.msg1151640#msg1151640">Quote from: Churchwarden on May 21, 2013, 08:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How should I smoke it?

If you have the possibility use DMT when it rains or near a water source (DMT is a &quot;water spirit&quot; and the best experiences you can have with it are to be obtained when water is present; conversely some of the worst are in arid situations with no water around for miles).

				Search for the Deemsters thread over in the Rumor Mill for good vendors (it&#039;s like the LSD Avengers thread). I&#039;ll personally vouch for RogerPete, his stuff is phenomenal.<br /><br />You seem very experienced with psychedelics and open minded, so I think you could handle a breakthrough on your first time. But like others have said, you&#039;re probably not going to smoke it very well and may waste a lot of DMT. Your call on this one.<br /><br />If you breakthrough, DMT may change your perception of reality forever (not in a tripping all the time type of way, but in a way you think about the nature of reality type of way). It certainly has for me.<br /><br />I recommend making a &quot;machine&quot; for smoking; those little liquor sample bottles work great! I&#039;ve heard the Glass Vapor Genie or other professionally made vaporizers work great too if you wanna shell out the cash. If you want to start with a sub-breakthrough dose, maybe try the sandwich method? Also, I&#039;ve heard the light bulb method may not be ideal due to chemical coatings inside the bulb. Actually on that note, if you build a &quot;machine&quot;, make sure you burn off all the coating off of the steel wool before hand.<br /><br />As far as tolerance, I&#039;d say wait a few hours between trips. I won&#039;t do it more than once a day at most (usually not more than once a week), just so I can get the most out of each experience.<br /><br />As far as general advice, if you breakthrough (you&#039;ll absolutely know when you break through, if you&#039;re not sure then you didn&#039;t):<br />-be open minded<br />-stay calm, no matter how absolutely mind blowing it is<br />-just observe, try not to exert your influence over the experience<br />-allow yourself to become completely immersed in the experience<br />-don&#039;t be afraid to COMPLETELY let go, even to let go of your body (you won&#039;t die, I promise)<br />-be respectful to &#039;them&#039;<br /><br />Also, whenever you decide you&#039;ve taken your last toke, hold in it as long as you possibly can, this is really key.<br /><br />Have fun!

				Another question before I try it, which I plan to do tonight, do you have to worry about doing anything ridiculous while tripping or will you just sit there? I plan on trying it alone and I live quite high in an apartment building so I don&#039;t want any kind of ridiculous ideas about my balcony or anything like that. I know it&#039;s not crazy uncommon for people to break shit and hurt themselves and do whatever else whilst on Salvia so I thought it was worth an ask.

				It is a good idea to have someone with you. Dangers include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Dropping your pipe on yourself and burning yourself<br />&nbsp;- Trying to stand up and taking a face plant<br />&nbsp;- Some people vomit, vommiting while out cold can cause choking.<br />&nbsp;- Someone finding you and not knowing what you are on and panicing.<br /><br />Now that I have done it several times I feel okay doing it alone, but a watcher is a good idea.<br /><br /><br />Your watcher should know to stay out of your field of vision and remain quiet. They should not disturb you until you speak to them. It is really annoying when some distraction pulls you out of your trip early.

Due to the nature of the DMT trip (very akin to an OBE/NDE) jolting you back from the dream state you are into too abruptly can cause a more or less severe form of shock (confusion, rapid heartbeat, momentary panic, headache etc. etc.) and it will much likely turn your trip into a bad one or anyway will make your &quot;return&quot; an unpleasant one.<br /><br />Naturally it depends also on the nature of the distraction. If it is soft it can be merely a nuisance, but if it is a strong one it will really feel like &quot;jumping back&quot; to your body at once (it feels like you are being sucked/pulled in abruptly). It has happened one time to me and it is not an experience I would like to repeat, especially because I was in a deep state of trance at the time. I had a severe headache after with vertigo and dizziness lingering for all the day.

				Tried twice today and no luck breaking through. My Machine was packed with wool too fine so once I started sucking it just caught fire which was decided unpleasant. Second I used the 2 Litre and tinfoil method, but I honestly am having a ridiculously hard time keeping the smoke in. I have seasoned lungs as a long time pot smoker but man this smoke is something else. I took 30mg, but I honestly think it was less about the amount and more about my inability to keep myself from coughing. <br /><br />Would you guys recommend trying to hold smoke in longer or taking steady big breaths to get more smoke through in a short time?

				I still don&#039;t even have a handle on what it would be like really. I felt lighter, and if I let go a bit my head would begin to loll about and kind of lift but in terms of the visuals it almost seemed like color swirled as an overlay to what was actually in sight, rather than the things I was seeing twisting about and changing color like when I&#039;m on mushrooms.

I finally got one of these after reading about it on a dmt forum: http://www.vaporgenie.com/glass-sherlock-vg-vaporizer<br /><br />This thing is great. You stuff about 15 screens down it and then put the dmt on top of that. Then it has this plug that goes on top with a ceramic filter that stops flames but lets hot air through.<br /><br />It seems to vape any amount in 2-3 hits. You just drawn the flame into it slow and steady for about 10 seconds and you get a huge puff. It does not get too hot so it is more effective and does not have a bad taste.<br />

Don&#039;t use steel wool, use Brillo. The steel wool is too thin and it will catch fire. You must use a steel wool that is very coarse, as the typical rubber pad, i.e. Brillo or Chore Boy (remember to burn the coating just in case; some brands of the rubber pads have a coating + various oils to sharp it that produces toxic fumes, you must burn them off. It&#039;s very easy to see if the brand you have contains those or not: if you put the Brillo under fire and it produces smoke then you must burn it until there&#039;s no more smoke produced).<br /><br />Try again with Brillo instead and it will work fine. The Machine cannot misfire if you use it properly. A slow, steady toke (increasing in intensity as you go) and you are good to go.

				Btw if you can find a pure copper brillo it is better. Copper has an heat transfer of 401 W/mK, stainless steel 16.<br />The only problem (at last where I live) is to find a proper one. I don&#039;t know if in the US it is different and it is easy to find proper copper pads, but I had to go to all sorts of troubles to find a good one here (some are not pure copper, some are too thin etc. etc.)<br />However if you have the luck of finding a good copper Brillo that&#039;s the way to go, but if you cannot find a proper one then it&#039;s better a good stainless steel Brillo than an fake/bad copper one (if for example the weave is too thin there&#039;s the same problem of steel wool, it catches fire).
