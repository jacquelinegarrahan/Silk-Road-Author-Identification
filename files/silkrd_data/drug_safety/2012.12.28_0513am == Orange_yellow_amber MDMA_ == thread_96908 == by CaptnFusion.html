				Well I was talking with someone about molly, and they were saying someone they know says the purest molly is supposed to be &quot;amber&quot;<br />From all my knowledge, including selling molly of various purities, cut in some cases, or most of the time straight from the lab, I always thought it should be white.<br />I&#039;ve seen brown before, but I know that just has to do with skipping the acetone wash. I&#039;ve looked into many recipes.<br /><br />Was browsing mdma on SR and saw &quot;amber&quot; rocks and it brought back up my curiosity again.<br /><br />Can anyone shed light on this for me?<br />What does the color mean? Is it more pure than white mdma?

				When I was younger I always thought &quot;pure&quot; MDMA was always white. Until a buddy came over with some brown stuff which was amazing, purer than anything that I hit prior to that.<br /><br />You can &quot;wash&quot; the MDMA to change the color, so you CAN get pure white MDMA. But I&#039;ve heard of white, grey, and brown MDMA, which is just the result of different impurities I believe. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of orange/yellow colored molly, but I&#039;m not the greatest expert of MDMA. But I know that different colors of MDMA do not necessarily represent the quality.<br /><br />Hope I helped a little. Cheers.

				It could possibly just be the producer wanting to &quot;brand&quot; his product with a slightly different recipe, addition of other drugs, or even just food coloring. Say you had blue MDMA, if it was really fucking good than you&#039;re going to try to find blue MDMA again.

				people think that brown mdma is pure because all of the white &quot;molly&quot; thats sold on the street is NOT mdma. pure mdma hcl is white/clear, just like methamphetamine

				Pure MDMA is white.&nbsp; But tan MDMA can be high purity also, because a very small amount of colored impurity can add a lot of color.&nbsp; Darker colors can be indicative of a lower qulity product that was prepared with less skill or less care. But darker MDMA can still be potent, because, as stated, a small amount of a colored impurity can add a lot of color.&nbsp; All that said, you cannot rely on color as an indicator of purity.&nbsp; But don&#039;t ignore color either!

				coloring molly to brand it sounds funny.&nbsp; Im sure it would work unless everyone started copying.&nbsp; I mean isn&#039;t that what the idea behind a pressed pill is? Branding it so you will look for it?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know these days pressed pills are always looked at suspiciously because there are so many bs ones out there. But atleast you would need a press to make pills.&nbsp; You could have some good stuff make it blue with food coloring or whatever and then get it out there and then here comes joe blow with his methylone and makes it blue the same way to get people to buy his. Just a thought. Not bashing the idea though. For novelty purposes different color molly would be cool. Like red or green for christmas. Orange for halloween lol. Have some fun with it

				MDMA freebase is a reddish orange liquid...when it is converted to an HCl salt it can retain some of that orange-ish color before it goes through a an acetone wash...

I don&#039;t know if MDMA is polar or non-polar or anything like that, but the idea that freebase is reddish-orange and that the conversion to a salt leaves some color behind... which goes away after an acetone wash? Sounds like the acetone is washing away some freebase.

				Real MDMA can be all types of colers, brown, orange, pink, they best i think is a darker greyish coler. It can be white too but normally people who sell you white molly its 4 mec or bk mdma. get more information online and learn how to tell the diffrence

				I&#039;m no scientist but I&#039;ve had mdma of all colors (err tan, grey, white) and I have to say I&#039;ve never really noticed much of a pattern to which color is more potent.

Color is more useful as an indicator of a lack of purity.&nbsp; A batch with too much color or smell can immediately be deemed impure.
