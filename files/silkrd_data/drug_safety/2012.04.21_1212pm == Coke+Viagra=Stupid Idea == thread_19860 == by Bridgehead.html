				Just thought I&#039;d throw my 2 cents in here since I didn&#039;t see it mentioned yet.<br /><br />Coke and Viagra doesn&#039;t sound to bright to start with does it?&nbsp; Yeah it&#039;s not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Was good for about 30 mins to an hour, after that, I thought my heart was going to explode.&nbsp; I&#039;m no mousy man, but I was in the fetal position for at least an hour, scared as fuck.&nbsp; I&#039;ve literally never been so scared in my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried to keep it cool for the sake of my partner&#039;s sanity, but at one point I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and looked up at her and said, &quot;I&#039;m scared honey, may need an ambulance.&quot; Which of course scared the shit out of her.&nbsp; Both of us high as fuck, this was quite a buzz kill to say the least!<br /><br />I managed to get through it without a trip to the hospital.&nbsp; But FFS learn from me and don&#039;t ever mix the two.

				I would say having sex and the exertion of that on top of your heart beating really fast from the coke was a more major factor and then Viagra was the cherry on top. It isn&#039;t good to exert to much physical energy when your heart is already 120 BPM I have had a bad experience going to work high on meth and busting my ass like I usually do, only to be scared shitless that I might pass out and die at work, and try to maintain composure in front of people. My job is very physically demanding.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to pound out her back next time and take it down a notch for you hearts sake. I know that is what you want to do when geeked up, because all your animal&nbsp; tendencies come out and it feels so good to fuck like your a wild man and ravage her.

				I felt like I was going to pass out at work on meth one time. I think I was dehydrated or my electrolytes were out of whack from sweating a lot and not replacing salts and water properly. I was running around replacing my ceiling tiles then went to work and my job was pretty physical too. Be careful and take care of your body. It&#039;s nice keeping some benzos on hand to relax and come down a notch if I get too amped.

				I took Viagra only once and i got much more side effects than with cialis...<br /><br />i often did take some cialis (10mg) after a party (mdma, coke, mephedrone, methylone... also combinations ;-))<br />and never had any problems with my heart.<br /><br />but i think that really depends on your heart and overall fitness maybe
