				Hi, I have a friend who this evening has taken a small amount of Amitriptyline to sleep well before tomorrow night. Tomorrow night she is supposed to be joining us for some of Ivorys MDMA. What I would like to know is<br /><br />1. Is this a safe combination? I read on wiki the halflife of Amitriptyline can be up to 50 hours so will still be in her system<br /><br />2. Is this one of the anti-depressants I have heard can pretty much cancel a roll from happening?<br /><br />Anyone have any experiences of these when taken together? She had already taken it before I was told or would of advised against it. I did do a quick search the only mention I could find was in the OVDB discussion subforum [http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7836.0] as one of the recommended substances neuroprotective against MDMA-induced neurotoxicity Under Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):Amitriptyline (Elavil) <br /><br />If there will be any effect what would it be? <br /><br />Can anyone shed any light on this for me?<br /><br />A couple of things that may help people answering. This is a once only dose to help her sleep, not a prescribed medicine. No history of depression. And she has taken MDMA numerous times so is not her first roll. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				1 - Yes, this would be safe.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t ideal, but as long as she isn&#039;t taking 500mg of MDMA she should be fine.<br /><br />2 - Yes, this is the kind of antidepressent that can cancel a roll.&nbsp; You said she took a small amount, so likely there won&#039;t be much of an issue.&nbsp; If she takes it daily or in normal quantities, she probably won&#039;t roll as hard.
