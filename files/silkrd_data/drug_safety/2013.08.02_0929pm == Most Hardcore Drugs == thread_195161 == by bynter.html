			<dd class="postbody">
				Well the other day when I had to go through my first mild benzo withdrawal(which sucked SOOOOOO much), I decided to look up a few Clearnet lists of &quot;Worst/most hardcore/most dangerous drugs&quot; to see how hardcore the public eye thinks benzos are. I knew most would probably be stupid to me, as I&#039;m become really detached from the public drug ignorance since I found SR, but boy was I surprised. So few people were even aware of the concept of classifying drugs. There was one ten item list, with three desperate spots taken up by methadone, heroin, and oxycodone. For the ordered lists, meth was almost always within the top 3, with one quote I remember in my head. &quot;Meth is perhaps the most physically devastating. Most meth addicts don&#039;t survive long.&quot;. LSD was within the top 6 on most, while Xanax was rarely ever past 8, if even on the list at all. <br /><br />As childish as ordered lists are, I thought maybe the good community of SR might want to make an ACTUAL list.(though really this is just an excuse for me to post that little story I just wrote). I&#039;ll start. The criteria is most likely to fuck up your life/you should be careful with it.(and my ordering of the items is loose)<br /><br />I: Freebase Cocaine - it&#039;s crack. <br /><br />II: Benzos - Just read the Wikipedia page on benzo withdrawal. It&#039;s called, &quot;Benzodiazapine Withdrawal Syndrome&quot;. Yeah, it&#039;s so fucking bad it&#039;s considered a syndrome. <br /><br />III: Opiates - A few that come to mind as the most hardcore of their class are fentanyl, because of it&#039;s strength, heroin, because it&#039;s heroin, oxycodone, because it&#039;s basically heroin, and methadone, because it&#039;s basically heroin with a euphoria that you almost instantly become tolerant to. <br /><br />IV: Ethanol - It has a very similar pharmacology to benzos<br /><br />V: PCP - Because it&#039;s like a hyper-stimulant with severe dissociation<br /><br />VI: MDPV - It&#039;s like meth, but can induce psychosis<br /><br />VII: Meth - Really not that bad if you don&#039;t neglect your body or take neurotoxic doses.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I think my ideal list would be :<br /><br />I : Opisyrd/Heroin - They literally devour your life, not many users use it non-habitually.<br /><br />II : Freebase Cocaine - People will do ANYTHING for that rush.<br /><br />III : Benzo&#039;s - Maintaining a habit is relatively easy, as it&#039;s not illegal for most users. The withdrawal is hell though.<br /><br />IV : Alchohol - Causes people to do horrible things and is very addicting.<br /><br />V : MDPV - Worse than methamphetamines. <br /><br />VI : Methamphetamines - Very long lasting, has a horrible crash, and the withdrawal just takes all will to do anything from you.<br /><br />VII : Cocaine - Addictive and can have a nasty withdrawl.<br />

				You dont understand the fact that it depends on the user. I dont care much for coke. Herlin was awesome to snort but it honestly wasnt much better than weed (IN MY OPINION). For me the most addictive was spice. The high only lasts 45 minutes and it makes we want to smoke all day, every day. Its like weed but better... most people think Im insane but thats my DOC. And if I smoke for two days, I get withdrawals.

I suppose, effects-wise, theyre somewhat mild. I don&#039;t want to start splitting hairs, but the criteria for the list was &quot;most likely to fuck up your life&quot;, and like I said, the withdrawal will do exactly that(sounds like you are among the rare people who don&#039;t get severe withdrawals). Though I almost want to say, that the effects being mild almost makes them worse, since they lull you to keep taking them until youre physically dependent. <br /><br />Though I also hesitate to call the effects mild. My friend took like four, and then he felt almost hypnotized to keep taking them until he had like 20, at which point he realized his mistake and so he took 40mg/meth to &quot;sober&quot; up, all of which ultimately ended in tim going into psychosis for three days.&nbsp; <br />

I used to find myself taking Xanax in every grey area scenario possible- am I going out? Well, I might be anxious, so pop a Xanax. Am I having trouble sleeping? Might as well pop a Xanax. Want to get really drunk? Pop a xanax with your beer. Acid trip needs to fade? Take a Xanax. It&#039;s very easy to fall into the trap of regularly taking benzos, I&#039;ve just been lucky enough to have not experienced withdrawal after a two month therapeutic binge.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Though I also hesitate to call the effects mild.

But yes, there&#039;s a threshold with benzos where once you push past it you&#039;ll keep taking more and more until the bottle is empty or someone hides the tabs.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently on a lot of ketamine, I don&#039;t know if my post makes any sense. I&#039;ve been staring at it for thirty minutes. Perhaps add ketamine to the list as I&#039;ve somehow gone through over a gram in only three days full of constant redosing and redosing and redosing despite not even liking this in comparison to something like acid or ecstasy.

				From most to least hardcore (defined as dangerous to health), my vote would be:<br /><br />1) Crack<br />2) Meth<br />3) Heroin<br />4) Opium<br />5) Cocaine<br />6) PCP<br />7) Sniffing glue/paint thinner<br />8) Alcohol<br />9) Oxycodone/Hydrocodone<br />10) MDMA<br /><br />Nicotine is extremely harmful too but its effects take the longest to take their toll. It should still go on that list somewhere.

				Very cool thread i&#039;m gonna try my own list with a brief explanation !<br /><br />I: Krokodil/desomorphine - This drug can be found in Russia and it&#039;s for people who can&#039;t afford heroin, This stuff will literally eat your flesh and will kill you quicker than you expect.<br />II: Heroin/Methadon - Well i think the most physically addictive of them all .<br />III Crack / Cocaine - Well you have seen then commercials ! (just kidding)<br />IV Crystal meth<br />V Ethanol - Just because it&#039;s legal dosen&#039;t mean it won&#039;t kill you. <br />VI Oxycodone/Hydrocodone<br />VII 25i 25b \ GWH - Just because these drugs are new people still don&#039;t know whats the long term effects and what it really does thus making it very risky!

				Why has no one mentioned nicotine yet?&nbsp; It&#039;s reported to be FAR more addictive than heroin, and has infiltrated even the &quot;sober&quot; crowd.&nbsp; You wanna call something hardcore?&nbsp; Talk to somebody who smokes cigs and lectures you about drug use and see how deep that drug is ingrained into their life.
