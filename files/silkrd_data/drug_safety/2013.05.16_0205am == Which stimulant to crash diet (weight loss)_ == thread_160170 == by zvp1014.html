				Hello all;<br /><br />I&#039;m not big on the whole &#039;weight loss pills&#039; scene; most of it seems to be utter bullshit.<br /><br />What&#039;s tried and true, however, is stimulants. I&#039;d like to drop a bit of weight quickly, and while I know it&#039;s insanely unhealthy and recklessly irresponsible, stimulants may be the best way to do so.<br /><br />To drop weight, which stimulant would you consider the <br />&#039;...&#039; Safest?<br />&#039;...&#039; Least addictive/easiest to quit?<br />&#039;...&#039; Least withdrawal symptoms?<br />&#039;...&#039; Cheapest?<br />&#039;...&#039; Overall most effective?<br /><br />Thanks!

				All ephedrine-based stimulants are addictive to a certain degree. However, they are the most effective on losing weight. Methamphetamine is by far the strongest substance.<br /><br />You could try the normal ephedrine pills. Ephedra being the natural stimulant was the precursor for many weight loss products after all.

				Adderall will halt your appetite for a few days, i.e. you&#039;ll get some bang for your buck.<br /><br />I do not use it myself so im not sure of withdrawl and addictive properties.<br /><br />Ive heard benzos can slow your appetite as well but ive never had that issue arise for me.

				The &#039;easiest&#039; (maybe hardest) way to loose weight is to quit sugar, which is harder to quit than hard drugs, but cut sugar completely from your diet and you will soon loose upto 0.5kg a day without much effort, maybe a little walking.<br /><br />Google 21 day sugar detox free and read it and try it, its really hard to follow it to a T, but you have to for it to work,but within days, you will start to feel so much better, have a tonne of energy, normalise blood sugar, normalise high BP and help with depression - these are all my personal experience from this diet.<br /><br />Best of luck

				If you have little to no experience with stimulants - caffeine or ephedrine will work well, and have less adverse side effects.<br /><br />If those arent working then switch to a low dose ritalin ,and if that fails then perhaps a low dose adderall.

				beta-2 agonists like ephedrine, albuterol, clenbuterol, etc are best for fat burning.&nbsp; don&#039;t forget the cardio.<br /><br />stimulants like Adderall and cocaine can reduce your appetite but that&#039;s a different approach.<br /><br />For the fastest weight loss there is DNP which is in a category of its own.&nbsp; Not worth it for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stick with the b2-agonists and cardio.

I&#039;ll definitely be doing some cardio while on it, and I&#039;m going to space it apart so as to not get a tolerance. Will eat a salad if I get hungry between days. SR is beautiful in the regard that even if I become addicted I don&#039;t have the willpower to find a local dealer; and it&#039;s pretty easy to restrict myself from ordering more as there&#039;s so much effort involved.<br /><br />

				Try the XR version of ADD meds such as Concerta, Adderall XR, or Vyvanse. Guarenteed to curb your appetite for at least 8 to 10 hours (or more) each time u pop a pill. Well at least I know it does for me

				Speed and treadmill will work well. Use the treadmill to get rid of anxiety and take a xanax after. Idk how great runnign on xanax will be.<br /><br />As for the appetite I highly recommend adderall, concerta, ritalin, etc. I use that frequently for schoolwork and have to force myself to eat. The prices on the road are kind of high so if you have friends with a script ask how much they will charge you. It will keep you awake so don&#039;t take it at night.

				If you want to take amphetamines, I recommend not taking adderall, vyvanse or dexedrine. Racemic amphetamine, speed, is more effective for weight loss, because it&#039;s more physically stimulating, and is also way cheaper. The XR version of ADD meds also cause less appetite suppression so it&#039;s not a good option.<br />Ephedrine seems like a better option, but I&#039;d buy it on SR, not in a pharmacy where you have to show an ID. Caffeine isn&#039;t really that effective for weight loss though.&nbsp; Maybe you should try clenbuterol, it seems promising.

				Other options:<br /><br />In addition to things suggested you can also use iodine thyroxine. Basically ups your metabolism burning more fat. It&#039;s downsides are extended use will cause hyperthyroidism. Oddly taking too high of a dose of iodine will suppress your thyroid lowering metabolism too.<br /><br />Bear in mind there is a pseudo-weightloss advertised by companies wanting to make a quick buck. Basically involves diuretics and you piss out the &quot;excess&quot; weight but it will rebound very quickly once you quit.

				Gonna lump my two cents in with several previous comments and say ephedrine.<br /><br />I work out religiously and follow a strict supplement and diet plan but when it comes to cutting, ephedrine stacked with caffeine is the be all, end all of weight loss regimes. Very muscle sparing and you drop fat like crazy, partially because you have a huge loss of appetite. Side-effects are moderate, tolerable if you can handle the edgy full of being on uppers.<br /><br />take a few with a 200mg caffeine in the morning, and then a few 4 or so times a day. Up your dosage progressively of a couple weeks until you are at the maximum you can handle side-effects wise, then take the dose down a bit and continue at this level until you have the desired effect.<br /><br />Ephedrine, diet and exercise I can easily take myself from 20% bodyfat to under 10% in a month. Dead easy to get your hands on, as well. Don&#039;t look to silk road first because I got myself two packs of 50 8mg tabs off some supplement site for $30

				As tree said, speed is a better stimulant and without the side effects of adderall, I would say thats a go to.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done speed so I can&#039;t recommend it but if you need to do work maybe ADD meds, if not speed.<br /><br />A legal option would be superHD.

				Dried some speed paste from MrImporter, took 20 mg oral, felt pretty good but nothing major- so I snorted 20 more mg. I feel absolutely fantastic! Feel like I can get things done, and not hungry at all. Plus, it almost feels like a natural high off life- not a super irritable caffeine high!<br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />@Methamphetamine- maybe; I have been able to keep 8 pills of mdma around the house and give 3 weeks between them, and since I get stuff off SR I could easily cut myself off from more meth.

				Welp, the amphetamine&#039;s worn off and I feel pretty down; it feels a bit like coming off of MDMA, but not as intense. Is this normal? The paste was 72% pure, any impurities that might be giving these negative feelings? Taking a Xanax has helped worlds, it&#039;s not too bad, just a bit sad is all.

				<br />Well. One that I know does this--meth--crushed and put into a capsule. 20mg-25mg. Will not have appetite all day--but sleeps fine come bedtime. Sometimes uses melatonin to sleep if needed-or Xanax. But usually do not need if speed is taken in the morning. Drink smoothies all day and a multi for nutrients? I don&#039;t know.......stay safe.

Do it the proper way. The effects that drugs can leave on you including addiction or becoming a crackhead. Type crackhead in youtube and see if you would like to be like them. Losing weight is simple. Count your calories then go into a deficit. 1000 calories deficit per day equals 7000 calories per week. I forgot how many calories in a pound. Think it&#039;s 3500 . If you want a some advise let me know. But drugs is not the right way to go. Trust me.

				I can&#039;t believe the responses you have got. That ain&#039;t advise mate. You only lose weight on drugs cause stimulants are appetite suppressants.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t eat you l lose the same amount of weight.&nbsp; Are you American btw? Just curious

				But if drugs is the route you want to take. Try meph or ephedrine based pills. Which fuck you up long term. Heart issues, lose your teeth, you use to be straight now you suck dick.&nbsp; But hey look in the mirror at least you lost weight.&nbsp;

				I can tell you from experience that adderall will cause significant weight loss if it is taken in excess or for extended periods.&nbsp; At the end of this semester, I only took it 2-3 times a week to help me study.&nbsp; On those days, I would practically eat nothing at all because I wouldn&#039;t have an appetite, not even after smoking pot during the comedowns.&nbsp; After one month of that, I am down 10 pounds. Keep in mind, I am&nbsp; 6&#039;3&quot; 210 pounds, so 10 pounds isn&#039;t a huge loss for me.&nbsp; However, I imagine that if I had taken it daily, the results would have been much more dramatic.

				I&#039;m currently taking speed sulfate for the same reasons too. It&#039;s not as effective as when I roll, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s because I&#039;m taking small amounts (20mg) in comparison to party doses of MDMA (100mg+). Probably going to up my dosage soon, just worried about building a tolerance.

				Dospan tablets are the best thing i,ve seen used for slimming. You can,t get them in the UK anymore but they,re great i,ve used them, they,re really speedy so you have to take them in the morning. Its like having a gram of speed in a tablet without the comedown feeling&nbsp; ;D

				ephedrines side effects are super minimal and honestly, I couldn&#039;t imagine getting addicted to hit. I feel a stronger buzz from the caffeine you take with it but it kills your appetite. If anyone uses it for recreation, literally anyone, I have to tell you you would get better results from literally anything else. I love drugs but I would NEVER use ephedrine recreationally, it does fuck all for you that&#039;s any fun. If you think someones going to suck dick for ephedrine you&#039;re a retard.
