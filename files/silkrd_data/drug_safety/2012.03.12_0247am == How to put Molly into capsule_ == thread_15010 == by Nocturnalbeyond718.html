				I just received 1g of Molly from a reputable seller on SR. (Thanks Tony!). <br /><br />I want to take it into an event this weekend, along w/ a few of my speakers (pending they get here on time) and I&#039;ve never put molly into capsules before. I am aware that parachuting works just as well, but I don&#039;t really want to deal with doing that at an event or having to go into a dark bathroom to figure it out. Last time I did that, I dropped some all over. <br /><br />Any advice/tips on how to do it without making a mess would be awesome. <br /><br />Thanks :) Cheers!

				Step 1: Buy capsules. Like easy vegi capsules would work i&#039;d assume.<br />Step 2: IF your molly is like giant rocks or crystals then crush them up to a fine enough powder to fit into the capsule.<br />Step 3: Open Capsule<br />Step 4: Place grinded/crushed mdma into capsule<br />Step 5: Close capsule<br />Step 6: Enjoy

				Yeah.&nbsp; I just use the capsule to scoop it out of the scale dish thingy.<br /><br />You can also get zigzags to parachute.&nbsp; You can cut it into smaller sections, fold it up, then lick it and stick it, so it&#039;s sealed in.

				ok not sure if your going to weigh it out or not but after trying many different way to cap stuff I found that it you leave it in the bag use 001 caps and take the big part of the cap and put it in the bag and stuff the mdma in it.&nbsp; then pull it out and put the top on it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t push it all the way on yet just slip it over the top.&nbsp; If your using scales you can now tare a blank cap and then put the newly filled cap on the scale.&nbsp; since you didn&#039;t push the top all the way on you can take it off and add or subtract to meet your desired dose.&nbsp; FYI with those caps and you fill up the big side that&#039;s about 200mg with most mdma.

				Here&#039;s how I do it.<br /><br />Get out my mg scale (yes, mg.&nbsp; if you don&#039;t have one, GET ONE).&nbsp; <br />Scoop out ~125mg mdma onto the scale.&nbsp; Note how much it weighs.<br />Dump powder onto a piece a paper folded down the middle.&nbsp; I use lab weighing paper, because it has some very nice non-stick properties.<br />Prop open capsule up on something <br />Take creased paper and set it on the capsule (with the crease in the capsule).&nbsp; Tilt down into the capsule and tap the paper.<br />If done correctly, the MDMA will slowly move down the paper into the cap.<br />Cap the pill.<br />Get out a pen, write the dosage on one side and the chemical on the other.&nbsp; In this example, you could use &quot;M - 130&quot; to signify that it is MDMA, and the quantity added was 130mg.<br />Swallow.

				How about using teeny, tiny, little, miniscule, toy, metal spoons?..... Ok. I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t have that. So fold up little pieces of tin foil and make your own. Hell with a little tin foil and duct tape you could Mcguyver anything together. Mcguyver once stopped a nuclear plant meltdown with melted chocolate bars, I shit you not!

				I write on all my caps, no matter if it&#039;s the only one or not.&nbsp; You never know when it&#039;s going to get mixed up, or when your not-so-sober self may be wondering what is in there (note: don&#039;t ever take something you aren&#039;t sure of while not sober).&nbsp; Also, dosage WILL vary, and it&#039;s nice to know that one is 140mg as opposed to 120mg.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as ink goes...hardly any is used, and it&#039;s not like you are injecting the stuff.&nbsp; Just use any non-toxic ink.&nbsp; I suppose if I wanted to I could put food coloring into my fountain pen, but that&#039;s honestly too much work.&nbsp; It&#039;s not going to do anything to you.<br />

				Yes, I would highly recommend getting a milligram scale off of Amazon. I got one for $14USD off of Amazon here:<br /><br />http://amzn.com/B0012LOQUQ<br /><br />I can&#039;t emphasize how important it is! Eyeballing amounts can be pretty dangerous, and dosages for stuff like MDMA is important. I also ordered tiny metal spoons as well. In my experience, a level scoop with one of these spoons (I forget which size spoon) gets you just about 100mg of crushed molly:<br /><br />http://amzn.com/B000MOYI5W<br /><br />Here&#039;s how I measure out and fill my capsules.<br /><br />1) I use an index card with the sides folded up, and one end is creased and cut so that it forms sort of a pointy funnel. I make sure to tare (re-zero) the scale after I place the index card on top of it.<br />2) Scoop or pour the molly onto the index card and weigh out your desired dosage.<br />3) Grab an open capsule and use the index card to funnel the molly into it.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are better ways if you get creative, but that method&#039;s worked for me.<br />

				I own the HA-20 digital scale they sell on buyresearchchemicals.co.uk. Together with the scale comes a little black plastic pan which you place your stuff one.<br /><br />This is a little hard to describe but basically the pan has two arms of different sizes attached to it which I am 100 % sure were specifally made to fill capsules as the small &quot;arm&quot; fits small capsules perfectly. <br /><br />The scale is also accurate :)

				I crush the crystals into a powder.<br /><br />I weigh my empty gelcap.<br /><br />I scoop approximately 100mg of powder out of the bag using the big end of the gelcap.<br /><br />I weigh the finished gelcap.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />For smaller stuff -- I weigh it and then poor it directly into the capsule using the scale&#039;s pan.

				Forums are indeed the perfect place for this sort of question.&nbsp; I am quite proud of my recent cap-packing achievements actually, and it&#039;s quite fun to sit at home with some music making some caps, thinking about all the good times you will have on them!<br /><br />I am proud because I managed to borrow a work mate&#039;s decent milligram scale for a night, managed to pick up some empty caps from local headshop and pack 2 grams worth!<br /><br />Initially what I did was make a makeshift cone-piece looking thing from a small circle of cardboard, rolled into a tiny cylinder after cutting out a pizza slice size (relative to the size of the circle, which was about 2cms in diameter), dab of sticky tape to hold the cone-like funnel together.<br /><br />Keep in mind, some caps can weigh around .1, I discovered, so I reset the tare every few caps with an empty cap, checking it was consistent, say it was say -.09 (almost a point) with nothing on it... (minus zero)<br /><br />Crushed my moonrock mdma crystal (hehe!) in a tupperware container with the end of a heavy solid dinner knife, took the other end of the knife and put 3 or 4 small scoops into the cardboard cone (with a hole in the bottom) going into one of the cap halves.&nbsp; Put it on the scale and adjusted by tapping some back out into the container if it was over, or putting more in.&nbsp; Put other cap half back on.<br /><br />I made 130mg caps<br /><br />Held them all up to the light, perfect!<br /><br />One thing to look out for though, is what the cap is made out of.&nbsp; I made the mistake of buying gelatin capsules, which I later found aren&#039;t broken down in the stomach all that fast....&nbsp; Unfortunately A friend of mine who had never had mdma before bought one from me, and I was all excited for him and his come-up, peak etc, and he never had it &quot;hit&quot; him.

				This is how I&#039;ve seen it done before:<br /><br />Put a business card on top of your scale.<br />Weigh out your molly on top of the business card, after pressing the TARE button.<br />fold the card into a funnel, and funnel it into the capsule.

It&#039;s always a risk, of course, but every semi-clever attempt I&#039;ve made to conceal my shit has always worked just fine. I&#039;ve only brought personal amounts to festivals, though.&nbsp; <br />

(minus zero)<br /><br />Crushed my moonrock mdma crystal (hehe!) in a tupperware container with the end of a heavy solid dinner knife, took the other end of the knife and put 3 or 4 small scoops into the cardboard cone (with a hole in the bottom) going into one of the cap halves.&nbsp; Put it on the scale and adjusted by tapping some back out into the container if it was over, or putting more in.&nbsp; Put other cap half back on.<br /><br />I made 130mg caps<br /><br />Held them all up to the light, perfect!<br /><br />One thing to look out for though, is what the cap is made out of.&nbsp; I made the mistake of buying gelatin capsules, which I later found aren&#039;t broken down in the stomach all that fast....&nbsp; Unfortunately A friend of mine who had never had mdma before bought one from me, and I was all excited for him and his come-up, peak etc, and he never had it &quot;hit&quot; him. It crept up over an hour to an hour and a half (far far too long for it to come on imo), and when he was feeling it was the one hour we were separated at the festival. Oh well, you live, you learn!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to another festival since, and my preparation/smuggling methods were my best to date!&nbsp; Many would probably consider it overkill etc, but I don&#039;t think anyone ordering from this site should be complacent with things they can definitely avoid.&nbsp; <br /><br />To take your molly caps into a festival (festival stealth!) or gig etc, take the pre-measured cap contents and roll into about a 1/2 of a cigarette rolling paper, twist, trim etc, as long as it&#039;s a medium density little ball.<br /><br />I took 2 x 130mg caps and put about 190ish split between two paper balls, and the remaining 70mgs in another, making a total of 3.&nbsp; The first two balls I put back into one cap, and I put the one ball in the other.&nbsp; I then hollowed out a few cigarettes completely, slid the caps in, and densely packed tobacco over the top.<br /><br />Total and complete stealth!&nbsp; So I knew the cap with the two paper balls was for the initial dose, and the one with only one was for the second!&nbsp; You really get a feel for these methods after a while!&nbsp; And my oh my, they hit within 20 minutes!<br /><br />Good luck to you soon-to-be cap-packer friend!<br /><br />P.S - I put miniature joints inside cigarettes the same way! Peace of mind is a great thing at any event that might be targeted by LE.&nbsp; ;) :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vegetable capsules all the way&nbsp; ? :D

Don&#039;t go directly verticle, because you can spill it. patience is a virtue with this, especially if you are doing alot. <br />
