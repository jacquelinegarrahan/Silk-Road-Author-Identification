				I&#039;ve tried smoking H in the past. Don&#039;t know if I was ripped off with something else, although the junkies did smoke it from the same bag so I guess not.<br />It made me a bit itchy and had to take a shit.<br />What is a good vendor EU-NL preferrably that sells good H to smoke, or snort. What is the difference with the numbers. #4 is just the strongest, right? Lower numbers are weaker? Or does it also have to do with if it&#039;s smokeable, injectable or snortable?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried codeine sulfate, 200mg&#039;s. Didn&#039;t get euphoric, prolly cuz of my ssri&#039;s.<br />Also tried 300mg tramadol. Noticed almost nothing, perhaps a bit more chatty. And would nod away sometimes (could be because of lack of sleep last week as well). It was not special. Perhaps a too low dose, but erowid sais that over 300mg&#039;s increases chances for epileptic seizures.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what could work better. Or if it&#039;s just pointless while on ssri&#039;s and a tca?<br />Just like it fucks with every drugs. mdma less empathogenic, mushrooms, acid, 2cb less trippy.<br />For amphetamines I need to take a lot more than most people.<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s seem to work fine. Tolerance for alcohol and weed has unfortunately increased greatly since after starting srni and tca. <br />Yes, I know the risks of serotonine syndrome, but the chances for that are very small for me. Id already have gad that with some drugs and dosages I;ve tried before.<br />(base)coke also doesn&#039;t give me the &quot;flash&quot;. Just had that once, while smoking a lot of base...<br /><br />Are there any opioids to recommend? Is H still the best choice? If so, what is a good vendor? The H thread is way too huge to read it all...<br /><br />It sucks being on srni/tca&#039;s. Takes all the magic away. Unless I take med holidays.<br /><br />What about ketamine and srni/tca?<br />I&#039;m really interested in trying that out very soon.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of GHB, and oxazepam (which isnt at SR at all!) and the ghb is only in liquid form in NL and havent received anything yet. I did use both K and N GHB. Most people would probably have died from the amounts I took, or what I had was weak. But one guy made it out of gbl so it could not be weak... I&#039;m thinking 10-20ml is a bit too expensive. And that it doesnt work in lower doses doesnt mean that taking more is not worse for my health.<br /><br />Alcohol+speed+2cb+a bit of mdma still worked very nicely. But that&#039;s a pretty unhealthy polydrug using.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear recommendations. Perhaps H then, if so from what vendor? Or instead of codeine and tramadol some morphine or methadone?<br /><br />Any help/advice will be appreciated.. Already wasted too much money. Or I was ripped off all the time, but I don;t think so.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m afraid that my experience is that while on SRNI/TCA&#039;s most drugs don&#039;t do what they&#039;re supposed to for most people. It&#039;s possible to take high doses and get close to the original, but that&#039;s either unlikely or very unhealthy. Opium still worked for me, a high quality high dose of MDMA did too as did high doses of Ket but that was on the edge of too much. Other than that it was just not worth it. Sucks to be anticipating something and then be completely let down by the results. Can&#039;t help you any further I&#039;m afraid but I thought I&#039;d share my experiences.

				Thx for your input.<br /><br />Question though: did you experiment with not taking the AD&#039;s?<br />I did some research and it&#039;s generally recommended to not take them 2-3 days before taking a drug. Problem is, some AD&#039;s will cause withdrawal effects even after one day not taking them. (Sick fuck psychiatrists saying they&#039;re not addictive.. they have no answer to the question what they would term: getting &quot;electrical zaps&quot;, complete insomnia for days (might be good for people who want to stay awake for long periods of time: take a specific TCA for a few months and then acutely or even slowly tapering them off).<br /><br />It&#039;s shit because I really miss those lovely acid trips. Now need to spend a lot more money on it and miss some magic.<br />Can still get wasted with intense amounts of stuff. But in combination with alcohol some people find it almost psychotic like. <br />Worst combo: zopiclone with alcohol and perhaps some valium while going out. Then afterwards that night will become a puzzle and the people who were with you tell you stuff about yourself like they&#039;re talking about somebody completely different.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a bit strange. It seems that in the USA people get a lot more meds combo&#039;s. Even srni+tca+benzo+adderall. While out here that was forbidden for some time because of the risk of serotonine syndrome.<br /><br />Wish I never started with that crap. Seems like I can&#039;t get off of it now anymore, unless I replace it with other stuff and do it in a way that I don;t get addicted to any product. Like day one: benzo, day two: opium or even H. Some speed to stay awake and two days later crash. Sometimes alcohol to sleep.<br />This option became possible to me since I know of SR. But meds are free while SR drugs are expensive.<br />Then again, who knows how things would be if I never used those &quot;medicines&quot;?<br /><br />For now I&#039;m going to use myself as a test subject and do the med holiday thing and replace with drugs from SR or irl people.<br />There is so little information about this on the net and I really hope there are some people out here who have similar problems. Perhaps we could find a way out of the psychiatric shit.<br /><br />But, as long as I can&#039;t afford the vendor price and make a bit of profit, I can not start experimenting with my idea of how best to withdraw from these so called meds.<br /><br />Sigh...<br />Should&#039;ve taken the username: guinea pig, or labrat/monkey...<br /><br />I wonder what mister SR researcher will think about this&nbsp; :o ??? :-X

				Well yes that was the first thing I tried, when I was on meds the drug info on the internet wasn&#039;t nearly as comprehensive as it is today so I was scared to mix everything. I&#039;ve always had very bad insomnia so for me that part of the withdrawal symptoms wasn&#039;t too bad. I did however get very jittery and completely mind fucked the first day or two, then it slowly subsided. After doing that a few times I figured mixing everything might be better. But as you well know it&#039;s not a solution so I switched back to med breaks. What worked for me was this: take your last meds for the night, then go about your night as you usually would, or stop in the afternoon and smoke a bunch of strong sativa weed to get to sleep. The next day I&#039;d get a few good lines of speed throughout the day to keep away the jitters, coffee for the focus and weed to not be too hyper and all day and be able to function. The second day would be less of everything. The third day&#039;d be just coffee and weed and then I&#039;d be alright as long as I kept smoking weed before starting my day and when I got home in the evening. The weed makes it a bit hard to get out of bed at first but in my opinion it beats insomnia. That regimen got me off meds completely after doing it a few times. Speed&#039;s not too addictive so if you can manage to not use it while on meds and get off the meds and speed as quickly as you can you&#039;ll be perfectly fine. I never had any withdrawal symptoms from the speed. Or just didn&#039;t notice them because of the freaky med withdrawal. Do however make sure you stay mentally stable before and after stopping the meds. Even if it&#039;s just for a while. No need to go psychotic, even the magic isn&#039;t worth that.

				I think I will never go psychotic. Unless I combine zopiclone with alcohol. But maybe the more appropriate word for that is temporary delerium...<br /><br />The weed and speed thing is what I tried. Speed just a bit because I cant find a reliable source. One time I had stuff with &quot;paracetamol&quot;. Almost killed my liver.<br /><br />It sucks there is no funding for drug research. And good treatments for addictions are not being applied. Like ibogaine for an opiate addiction.<br /><br />While asking what the reason of my life is I figured it had something to do with helping out making drug research legal, and obtaining drug-med interactions or best ways to quit meds.<br /><br />Oh well..<br /><br />If any others have some experience or words to share, please do so.

				Haha we have seem to have come to the same conclusion then Virmo, I too dedicate my time to the research of drugs and combinations of them. I figured if nobody else will do it than I will. I might not make a huge impact on the world but if I can help a person or two by supplying them with good information I&#039;m happy.

				I know of some real kick ass combo&#039;s. Some could cause death though. But if it is possible to make certain guidelines for &quot;average&quot; people, then I would help happily.<br /><br />Some examples (from erowid):<br />For sex:<br />mdma/or speed/ or coke, or combo (but watch out, pretty dangerous) with ghb and viagra. Cannabis possible, not necessarily. <br />I read the nbome I or something version is a psychedelic with sexual fantasies.sex enhancing capabilities. Would loce to try that someday I suppose :p<br /><br />Bah, too tired for the rest now. And I think there is already a thread on this.
