				So my gram of K just arrived and I&#039;m very excited to try it. <br />The problem is I don&#039;t own any precision scale, so I&#039;m not quite sure how I shall do this, or if it is possible at all without one? I thought I could just judge the amount by eye, as I plan to take a small amount at first anyhow, but I&#039;m not that sure if it&#039;s that safe lol :S Also as I haven&#039;t sniffed any drug before I&#039;m also a bit unsure here, but I guess you can&#039;t do that much wrong? <br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m a noob, so excuse me if these questions are dumb. Thankyou still in advance.

				Crush it all up. Put your key in the powder so there&#039;s a small pile on the end of it. Either sniff off the key or put it onto a surface and line it up. You dont need much to get a feeling so make sure the pile is small.<br />Have fun k&#039;s one helluva drug

				Took a bit about a half an hour ago and didn&#039;t feel anything,&nbsp; took a bit more 15 mins later and still didn&#039;t feel anything, other than slight dizziness tiredness.&nbsp; Probably just took TOO little... Can I take some more right now or would that be a bad idea?

				Hmmm... What do you mean by K Cramps and ending up in the stomach?? I took a slightly bigger line 25 mins ago, and I can feel some effects... The nostril with which i&#039;ve sniffed doesn&#039;t stop dripping, is that normal? It kinda feels like all the K is dripping out my nose ... also writing that post took me fuckoing long, dunno if t&#039;s me or the K

				If its dripping down your throat then thats good but if its coming out of your nostril then sniff it right back up there. Sniff it so it goes right up into your sinuses.

				I hear good things about Fartbomber. My first K experience involved about 100mg. It can burn something fierce but the best way to get a feel is to snort it in a short amount of time. I staggered it out rather like you have and it diminishes some of the effect. If you bought a gram, without a scale I&#039;d suggest emptying out the bag and dividing it into two equal-ish piles. Then do that a second time(for four piles). Then do it one more time(for eight piles, or just keep halving one). <br /><br />You should end up with a general idea of what 100-150mg K looks like. Put away the rest of your K and crush up what you got in front of you nice and fine. Cut up a straw (or roll up a small piece of paper or something) to snort the line(s) with. I find it easier to break the ~150mg pile you have into 3-5 lines and snort a line in each nostril (closing whatever nostril isn&#039;t doing the snorting with your free hand) and then lightly pinch your nose shut not all the way but enough that you can snort the powder back further if you feel it&#039;s going to fall out your nose. <br /><br />Wait a couple minutes and finish up what you have in front of you. Then lay back and get cozy and enjoy.<br /><br />Cheers!

				I don&#039;t know how many mg&#039;s I ended up taking, but I just started with some small lines getting bigger. In the end I finished up a whole lot... Probably too much lol. I can only fairly remember what happened after the last line I took but it wasn&#039;t anything like expected at all... Not that it was bad, but it was very weird and also scary. At times I was afraid I&#039;d go insane. I was pretty paranoid and I don&#039;t think I was in, but definitely in a near K-Hole state. I could still perceive my environment, but everything looked warped, also it all seemed foreign and it felt like I was always lying there on my bed, and I didn&#039;t know anything else... Also felt pretty nauseous, probably because of the disgusting backdrip. I tied to hold it back, but I ended up vomiting and it felt so unreal, I felt like a god vomiting out a whole universe... After that I didn&#039;t feel good at all, I felt nauseous the whole time even after coming down and kind of depressed. Today I still feel nauseous as well. I obviously overdid it, but it was a lesson... Gonna take a break a while before I take it again.

				I did pretty much same first ket time. Had a small amnt, then a bit more then a bit more until i laid on the couch and couldn&#039;t move. I got the idea the world was not real at all and everything was plastic. Was very unstable on me feet afterwards. <br />Smaller amnts make me feel a bit more euphoric rather than just fucked up.
