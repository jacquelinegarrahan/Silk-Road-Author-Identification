				I have done 25i about 4 times now.&nbsp; The first three time I had slight nausea which passed around an hour, but would randomly reappear during the trip.&nbsp; The last time I took 25i I had extreme nausea and I felt terrible for about 2 hours after the onset of effects, eventually throwing up.<br /><br />All of my experiences have been with 1mg blotters (placed between gum and upper lip for about an hour), except for the 3rd time where I took 2x1mg blotter.&nbsp; I always smoke weed when I take 25i and I also drink beer.&nbsp; It occurred to me that the alcohol interaction may be the cause of the nausea, because many of the 25i reports I&#039;ve read are absolutely glowing with little to no mention of nausea, and after my last experience with the puke session I am not really thrilled to take it again.<br /><br />Any feedback, advice or anything would be much appreciated

				All 25&#039;s make me nauseous. Take some drammamine about an hour before dosing, that gets rid of most of it for me.

				Oh interesting.&nbsp; That sounds pretty good.&nbsp; I will definitely try that.<br /><br />Do you usually dose 25s on an empty stomach?&nbsp; How about drinking alcohol?

				Try them on an empty stomach and avoid drinking alcohol. I usually take magnesium or benadryl for several drugs that give me an unpleasant body load so maybe they might help or maybe not? ???<br /><br />Some simple but effective advice is eating healthy, exercising often, and avoiding tobacco and booze. Basically avoid an American lifestyle for pleasant trips. ;)

				If you have access to a local health department, or if you can find it here, a medicine called Zofran is incredible for completely eliminating nausea. Just tell any practitioner that you have been feeling ill and the last time it happened, the ER gave you Zofran because you cant have phenergan for some reason. Theyll hook you up as it doesnt have any negative/addictive properties. I&#039;d suggest taking it about an hour before you start, normally it&#039;s a sublingual pill that dissolves in under a minute.<br /><br />Shouldn&#039;t noticeably impact the trip in any way - but I would agree with above and definitely lay off the alcohol. Definitely isn&#039;t helping matters.<br /><br />Take care and good luck

				Thank you so much everyone.&nbsp; This is all very helpful info.<br /><br />I will definitely try the empty stomach.&nbsp; Is it possible that what I have is poor quality 25i, which as a result has an extra unpleasant body?&nbsp; My friend and I have done it together each time and for the first two hours we are literally miserable and we are questioning as to why we have put ourselves through it once more.&nbsp; Then some time passes and we end up have a great time.&nbsp; Haha

Take for instance 2C-E. Some people get dreadful body loads, puke their guts up, and hate it. For others like myself the come-up is MDMA quality euphoria with the remainder of the trip nearly on par with LSD with no negative effects to speak of. ;)

				We have people complain of nausea, its just a pit fall that comes with the drug. Most people dont experience it but some do.

				So variations of quality/purity is probably not the culprit?&nbsp; Most likely my individual body chemistry.&nbsp; But I&#039;m going to try it w/out drinking and see how it goes.

				No, quality/purity wont be the cause of your nausea. We&#039;re just unfortunate, hehe. Try the Drammamine and/or Benadryl. Just pick some up the next time you&#039;re at the grocer.
