				I just tried shrooms last night (P. Galindoi chocolates) and the trip was pretty enjoyable and fun. Some swirling/flowing colors and an overall positive/happy experience. The only bad part is that the shrooms taste like shit. I&#039;m still trying to decide what tastes worse, shrooms or mdma as both taste like satan&#039;s shit and piss.<br /><br />After trying shrooms, I&#039;m curious to see if there&#039;s any RCs that come close to its effects that doesn&#039;t require you to eat shit? Maybe something from the 2C family?

				Grind it, dry it, cap it<br /><br />Only good phych RC I&#039;ve liked was 25i-Nbome. But, if you have readily available source of natural drugs, use those.<br /><br />

				Yes, 4-AcO-DMT is converted to psilocin in vivo. Psilocybin, found in shrooms is also converted to psilocin. I&#039;ve tripped off of 4-aco before, was exactly like a shroom trip. I can imagine somebody slingin&#039; boomers could easily put some 4-aco on top of their shrooms to make them like 2x+ more powerful.

				o-acetylpsilocin is frequently reported to be subjectively smoother than shrooms and many experience slight differences than shrooms, suggesting while deacetylation produces psilocin as would dephosphorylation of psilocybin. many believe the precursors to psilocin also posses their own effects or at least alter the trip through pharmacokinetics...<br /><br />i would recommend kwiktrip if you are interested in 4-aco-dmt. extremely fast shipping and reliable.

				Is 4-AcO-DMT something I&#039;d have to smoke like normal DMT? I don&#039;t like to smoke anything except weed.

				Why not just buy some of Galindoi&#039;s caps when his store is back?&nbsp; Stick to nature if possible.&nbsp; That&#039;s the best part of his capsules...you can&#039;t taste anything, besides when you burp!

				I would recommend 4-HO-DIPT, 15-30mg. Can get a bit intense in higher doses and the stomach will get a little bit &quot;fizzy&quot;.

				4-aco-dmt can be administered through a variety of routes, including oral (capsules, drinking dissolved powder or parachuted), insufflation, smoked etc<br /><br />I personally dont enjoy shrooms because some in my area are actually picked from the wild, and I do not trust that the gathers can identify the difference between the local toxic varieties and the desired psychedelic ones. Plus with 4-aco generally the negative body load and darker/anxiety provoking aspects of the trip are decreased compared to shrooms<br /><br />I too generally suggest to stick with natural substances, such as mescaline and dmt extractions one performs themselves. However, i feel in this case, as with lsd compared to lsa, slight tweaking by modern chemistry can provide a much more enjoyable, more insightful experience.

				Come unto me my trippy little children! I have a huge bag of 4-ACO-DMT ready to be split into packages and posted off for your pleasure! :P<br /><br />Seriously though if you want some and want to talk shop feel free to get in touch, I&#039;m actually having a 25% sale on grams at the moment and there are no buy limits. FE is ONLY required for players with 0-5 transaction history<br /><br />The ride is more smooth than shrooms on the whole and IMO has a much more profound feeling of rebirth on it. It&#039;s a very deep psych and it&#039;s good for exploring the soul. <br /><br />First timers should take it orally, if you are a true playa then try snorting it but believe me, that shit is more intense than a donkey show. <br /><br />My product is the freebase so is more potent by weight than the fumarate/HCL salt. Best to keep this compound in the fridge or at least always ensure it&#039;s stored in an air tight containe (two zippies best).<br /><br />Let me know! :)

				the effect of 5-meo-dmt is absolutely nothing like dmt... nor is the dose anything close to dmt.<br /><br />i dont think these should be compared as being equivalent, just as 4-aco shouldnt.<br /><br />since you have the freebase limitless that is actually the form which can be smoked and vaporizes before burning as the salt does... not to say you wont oxidize much of the material, but the bioavailability should be the highest (and counter balance the loss) as it is with most smoked compounds unless something really strange is going on I have not read?

				Thanks for the replies! I guess I&#039;ll try some 4-ACO then. How different is actual DMT compared to this and what do you guys recommend as a normal dose?
