				I know it&#039;s very difficult to know what&#039;s best to start off at given the quality of the gear and the tolerance of the induvidual.<br /><br />But, where would a regular H user on here typically start at?&nbsp; I have a pretty high tolerance as I take 100mg MS Contin twice daily i&#039;ve done my share of opiates, so my tolerance isn&#039;t as high as a regular H user, but i&#039;m not&nbsp; vulnerable as a 0 tolerance user looking at what to start at.<br /><br />With ROI being insufflation (snorting), I figure 5mg is too is too low, &#039;think&#039; that 10mg would be the place to start , but would that be wasteful as well and may as well just give er with 20mg?<br /><br />I only plan on buying enough to try H once, that&#039;s why its important to me what a solid starting dose is for someone with a moderate tolerance.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to have my head explode in euphoria, just a good typical nod that H users get, and i&#039;m trying to be semi-cautious as well cuz I dont want to overdo it and be throwing up bile for 5 hours.<br /><br />Since i&#039;ll only be doing it once, i&#039;ll be buying a very very small amount, and so i&#039;ll have no room to play around at lower doses first and then tapering up.&nbsp; Just want to do it once.<br /><br />I&#039;d be very grateful for any advice (other then &#039;don&#039;t do it&#039; ... I appreciate your concern, but it&#039;s a decision already made) anyone could give me please.<br /><br />Oh, and who at this time are the best H vendor&#039;s on SR so I know when i&#039;ll already know when I buy it that it&#039;s high quality dope and to take that into account with dosing?<br /><br />I think in the past I recall vlad&#039;s name a lot, and I think it was all good stuff to be said, but anyone know of quality?<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/75bd271f88<br /><br />Same with MMM (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/87edca334c &lt;--- Thats WAY TOO MUCH money though :( ), OPI (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/04efc0e31b) or any of the other Canadian vendors as i&#039;m trying to stick with Canadian vendor&#039;s to remain&#039;s domestic? <br /><br />BUT, I love buying from NL too, stuff from there gets to me like next day, so outta all vendor&#039;s in that case who currently has the best H (and vends it in small amounts)?<br /><br />Thanks so much guys, sorry for so many questions.
