				expiration dates are actually just legally required - it is the time that they can guarantee there will be no loss of potency. they want to make sure you get the full dose you are recommended, in addition to wanting you to buy new meds from them even if you still have them remaining = more money for the pharm companies<br /><br />it does not automatically mean the drug has degraded or especially that is is dangerous to use or something like that....<br />&nbsp;http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/update1103a.shtml<br /><br />also the army/fda conducted research showing 90 percent of 100 drugs are still safe and have enough potency remaining even after 15 years to be effective enough to still use if needed<br /><br /><br />more than likely a small percentage of the morphine has degraded to pseudomorphine or n-oxide but the majority of the active morphine will remain.&nbsp; if the solution has turned cloudy that is another situation - may suggest contamination.&nbsp; i know from personal experience a vial for IV can be water lined (snorted) that had been expired for a couple years with effects, but i dont know if i would recommend IVing without first trying out some using another ROA
