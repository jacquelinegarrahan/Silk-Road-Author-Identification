				Hey I have 100mg of 4-aco-dmt, I have never done this stuff before (i have done mushrooms, lsd a lot though) I do not have scales which go to 0.01 so getting an accurate dosage may be difficult, im just wondering if anyone could tell me which would be a good starting dose and if i should hold off until i purchase new scales.<br /><br />thanks<br />g

				20mg is a good dose. Sine you&#039;re new to this particular substance, I&#039;d recommend taking a smaller dose first as an allergy/toelrance test, maybe 10mg. You should have no problem eyeballing the dose, just split what you have in half, then split one of those halves into five equal parts. You coudl even try to McGyver a balance scale if you wanted.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like watching movies on psys, since I get dispersive and find it hard to follow the plots. But if that&#039;s not your case, watching Avengers in 3D will certainly be quite the experience while tripping.<br /><br />Have fun!

				if you havent done it already, i would recommend you start pretty small, for oral around ten or fifteen to start, some take up to 25 or even 30 mg but I think they probably arent too sensitive and want an intense experience. Some that have smaller body mass or are sensitive use doses around 8 mg for a moderate trip. Definitely start crazy small for insufflation, thats a hard one to gauge but very small doses, maybe 1/3 of oral for some people... and work your way up since the effects are fairly rapid. <br /><br />you can accurately measure the powder by using volumetric measurement. Through dissolving a known quantity of drug in a known amount of solvent, such as high proof EtOH, then after mixing thoroughly, one can then accurately measure the small amount of powder by measuring the easier to measure liquid. <br /><br />If you take 100 mg of 4-aco and dissolve in 20 ml of alcohol, then 100 mg/20 ml means each ml contains 5 mg<br /><br />Use an oral syringe to measure out two or three cc which contains 10-15 mg 4-aco and shoot in your mouth, then wash down with something. I would say just add to a drink but I am not sure if it will precipitate out and to the bottom of the glass b/c i am unsure of the solubility of 4-aco in aqueous solution... you could just rinse the glass multiple times though. <br /><br />volumetric would be the most accurate way, but if youd prefer not: pulverize the powder as fine as possible, split twice, then each of those split, followed by the third symmetrical division should yield 8 piles of 12.5 mg, and would likely be within +/- 5 mg so you arent likely to hurt yourself, just trip harder than you expect. with the steep dose response curve of 4-aco and variable density of some powders I would not recommend this method or use it personally
