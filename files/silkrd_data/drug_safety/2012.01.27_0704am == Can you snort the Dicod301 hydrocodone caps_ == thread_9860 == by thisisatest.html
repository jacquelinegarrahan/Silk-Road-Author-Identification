				brownpurple has an interesting new posting of a drug I have never seen:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/18965<br /><br />It is hydrocodone with out the APAP in a gel cap.&nbsp; Sounds great!&nbsp; But the kick is there are a couple of other ingredients, here is the list:<br /><br />Hydrocodone bitartrate: 15mg<br />Cyclizine Hydrochloride: 25mg<br />Bisacodyl: 2mg<br />Benzyl benzoate: 0.01%<br /><br />So I am wondering if<br /><br />1 - Has anyone had these?&nbsp; If so, how did you ingest them and how do they compare to 15mg of your standard hydrocodone/apap pills.<br /><br />2 - Considering the other chemicals in here, do you know if this is safe to snort?&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not give it a test first without hearing from some folks that know a little more about these other ingredients.<br /><br />Thanks SR :)

				I can&#039;t speak to that particular batch of pills, but I came across some 30mg pills of the same compound dealing with a person who had access to them through clinical trials. I didn&#039;t try snorting them but it seems almost like it would be a waste since these pills contain not only hydro, but something to counter the oppy constipation and an opiate potentiator.

				When mine arrived from him they were broken already... I hadn&#039;t found out if it was safe or a good idea to snort or not so I just swallowed all the powder, have to say - enjoyed them just as much as the standard hydro/apap pills.

				Sorry for the thread necro; I thought I&#039;d add my experience with these guys in case anyone is interested.<br /><br />So a friend ordered some Dicod 301s from some South African pharmacy. We each took one about an hour and a half before this post was written, and it certainly feels like I&#039;m on an opiate right now. It doesn&#039;t feel as strong as regular M305 Vicodin but then again I&#039;ve been crazy buzy and haven&#039;t slept much in days. It relieves my muscle pain and soreness, which is all I really needed them for anyway. <br /><br />For some reason, it doesn&#039;t feel like I can nod off these, at least not from just one. It seems like 10mg of confirmed US hydrocodone produces more of a &#039;high&#039; than the supposed 15mg in these Dicods. The pills also varied in weight from 420mg to 550mg (includes capsule) and I took one of the lighter ones. My friend took one of the &quot;stronger&quot; ones and reported an overall better high than I did. He just took a 2nd one a few minutes ago and is starting to feel stronger opiate effects like itching and light nausea, despite whatever is in there that&#039;s supposed to lessen that.<br /><br />No idea if you can snort it or not. Should have mentioned that earlier lol.<br /><br />I will edit this post if necessary, including if and when I take one after actually getting some sleep.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Someone sent these in for testing at ecstasydata: http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2440<br /><br />Turns out they contain Codeine, Cyclozine, and Diphenhydramine. Although they don&#039;t truly contain hydrocodone, it seems that there is enough codeine in there to give a pleasant, drowsy buzz. The combination of all those damn anticholinergics plus my sleep deprivation certainly made it feel like I was nodding, although I doubt there was enough codeine in there to actually cause me to nod in a strictly opiate fashion. It definitely felt stronger than a Tylenol 3 and was better for my pain too, FWIW.

				I have a question for whomever has taken these:<br /><br />What did you feel like and how long did the effects last? I&#039;m very happy someone sent one of these pills into a lab because my supplier claims they&nbsp; &quot;definitely contain 15mg&quot; of hydrocodone per cap but they don&#039;t according to this lab (if it&#039;s definitely the same exact pill that was sent in because i know there are many other capsules w/ the same colors).<br /><br />I used to know someone that took these on a regular basis and they swore by them...<br /><br />I am also getting another sample size of another weird combo pill that contain valum 5mg and codeine 100mg in them... I wonder how those will work.

				At this point, what&#039;s in those Dicod301s and the CMDs (100mg codeine + diazapam) is anyone&#039;s guess. The online pharmacy selling them swears that they come as advertised, claiming that ecstasydata&#039;s tests are not thorough enough to differentiate between Codeine and its derivatives.<br /><br />FWIW, the Dicod301s do not feel like codeine to me personally. It feels more like hydrocodone than it does Tylenol 3s or Codeine/Promethazine syrup, but not like an actual 10mg Vicodin/APAP pill. Either it&#039;s a very high dose of Codeine along with all those antihistamines to make it feel different, or it&#039;s a low dose of hydrocodone, as in way less than 15mg. They absolutely do work for pain though; not as well as real Vicodin did for me, but take 2-3 Dicods and it&#039;s close enough. Watch out though, as the doses in the pills are NOT uniform at all. Some had 50-100mg more powder inside than other did, and those were much more potent.<br /><br />Those red CMD pills were getting excellent reviews just a few weeks ago, but now my friend over at the OP scene tells me that recent shipments of the pills have been weak. I will ask him again today and see what he says.
