				So my little Mandy-Monsters do any of you REALLY get the Tuesday blues? I am asking because it&#039;s discussed quite a lot in the MDMA trial that&#039;s just been on the TV but I never suffer from it. Max I get is 1 day after and then I&#039;m fine. <br /><br />Discuss.

				Same here mate, I drink a fat glass of milk and 100mg of 5htp along with other vitamins when the roll wears off and there&#039;s little to no comedown. I mean after 250mg+ dosages I can feel a little weird (occasional dizziness when getting up quickly, more though than normal) for a couple days after but barely noticeable. I also get a slight urge to be with the people I rolled with for a few days after as well, weird right?<br />I think the Tuesday blues only occurs when people take one to many E pills with things like BZP and other shitty chems in them..

				I was wondering the same thing because I don&#039;t get it at all, even after completely ridiculous over-the-top nights with 600 or 700mg. I remember when I started over 10 years back the first 2 or 3 times I got really depressed, like, curl up and bawl depressed the next day. <br /><br />Then came a prolonged phase of excessive coke use, and after that was over and a long break from drugs altogether I went back to E and never got depressed again.<br /><br />Maybe I fucked up my brain with the coke or something, who knows...

				Lol I don&#039;t really get all NHS about it mate. I do roughly 50-75mg lines but the Meph/Mandy ratio is about 40/60 respectively so you&#039;ll be doing 50-75mg of Meph and 75-100mg of Mandy per line.

				Never get anything close to Tuesday blues from MDMA.&nbsp; In fact, I get a nice afterglow the next day.<br /><br />However, one weekend I took way too much MDA one night and then MDMA the next night.&nbsp; On Tuesday night I had crazy nightmares, and I never get nightmares.&nbsp; Lesson learned: go easy on the MDA.

				Interesting. I find this quite eye-opening actually because you can see it&#039;s possibly the difference in quality that brings on Tuesday Blues maybe? Purely speculative there but my friends who buy Mandy and Es IRL get Tuesday Blues but when they take the stuff I buy from here they don&#039;t. <br /><br />Very interesting indeed.

				With any serotonergic drug if I don&#039;t drink a lot of water during the trip I get the nastiest migraine the day after. But I have a prescription for migraine medicine so I just sleep in and take one of those and feel completely better. I&#039;ve never had the blues from any empathogen - with some of them ( namely methylone ) it has been a task to not compulsively redose and when I decide to stop its a bummer but other than that I don &#039;t get any negative side effects.

				i am actually one of the people who notice a slight depressive state for a little while a couple days after taking high quality molly.<br /><br />however, i started using at a time of great distress emotionally, used to actually make me feel decent enough to continue making it day by day... often using multiple times a week for half a year, and it wasnt until a few months into the heavy use that i started noticing the down feeling after i hadnt dosed in a few days.<br /><br />now i have only used a few times in the past 6 years and each time i do i can tell i have disrupted the natural balance of my serotonergic system and just feel kinda off. its not anything major but i just dont feel as bright as my normal self and slightly irritable. i dont particularly enjoy the mdma experience anymore though anyway because it feels too forced and artificial to me. i have to much energy and just want to chill and relax generally (now i prefer downers). plus i think i am particularly sensitive to it after my excessive use and now using so infrequently so my experience is likely different than most

				Yeh I&#039;m not sure about &quot;Tuesday&quot; so much..&nbsp; maybe if you roll on Sunday nights? ;) <br /><br />I feel like I&#039;m very aware with my state of mind and it usually goes like this:<br /><br />Friday Night : Rollin&#039;<br />Saturday : Lovely afterglow most of the day<br />Sunday : Slightly lower than baseline mood (not depressed)<br />Monday : Baseline<br /><br />Remember to take Vitamin C when you roll, everything is better. <br /><br />Use nootropics to keep your brain chemistry right. If you are getting depressed you are doing it wrong.

				My experience with MDMA of known quality is linited, unfortunatelye, but I def. get sader than usual for a couple days after.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it varied so much during my phish following days and was also quite frequent.&nbsp; I actually have agram coming soon of very high purity mdma, so i will update this thread on the after experience!

				I actually get this. Before i found SR i would take the worst pills here in the US, some are good but most of them are bunk and who knows what there cut with. I would also abuse doing it alot so i would feel moody like the grinch, i would be just out it for a few days up to 2 weeks. I was really in a funk but then i discovered piracetam and that stuff works wonders, before i took this i wasn&#039;t really able to concentrate on a lot of things and was feeling just overall depressed but taking that everyday for 2 weeks i started to feel normal. Now at days since I&#039;ve discovered quality stuff, i don&#039;t feel as moody but i still feel like the grinch but i think that&#039;s just because of how often i do mdma. Spacing it out definitely makes me feel better overall. I finished my bottle of piracetam :(

				Recommend C in high doses with the MDMA (helps reduce damage in the first place). As for your daily stack, B vitamins, Choline, Magnesium, R-ALA &amp; Piracetam. There are other racetams, but Piracetam is the oldest and most well known.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry about 5-HTP&nbsp; Tyrptophan supplements, 95% is in your gut and it&#039;s highly unlikely you are deficient. You&#039;ll probably just get the runs. <br /><br />There are lots of hustlers in the nootropic space so just build your own stack and research / modify amounts as you go. If you haven&#039;t done it before you&#039;ll notice a huge difference in your head within the first week.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay safe kids!

I&#039;ve read reports stating the opposite, though. Taking it regularly along with Choline has been the key for me. It seems the correct dosing is dependent on the individual - I found my sweet spot to be 800mg x 3/day + choline.<br /><br />I&#039;m in a creative field, and there has been a definite improvement in both the quality and quantity of my work. So much so that others in my field were asking what different techniques/tricks I started using.

				Just acquired a shit load of Piracetam, and about to order some Choline.. So I&#039;m thinking about 1200mg of Piracetam x 2 a day, 3 days before/after the roll. How much Choline would you recommend daily to go with the Pira.?

If you&#039;re brain serotonin levels and receptors are returning to baseline and healthy nominal conditions as soon as possible then the next roll you have will feel stronger and cleaner. Some people say the C also improves the roll too. <br /><br />Also stay away from alcohol, it negates the positives of a lot of this stuff (including MDMA).&nbsp;

You could likely up your dose of P if you are free of side effects.

				I usually feel drained 2 days after, like I have this annoying, light pressure in my head and I feel kind of not-all-here emotionally.&nbsp; Aside from one day of shitty vibes, I&#039;m back to normal the day after usually.<br /><br />I just now picked up some 5-HTP to take on the comedown and the following day...if I don&#039;t get the usual crash then I&#039;ll know it&#039;s helped.&nbsp; I&#039;m also gonna try paying close attention to eating healthy the day prior and the day that i plan to roll.<br /><br />It&#039;s not really severe depression, just definitely feels like a chemical had a wild party in my head, which it did.&nbsp; I loves my Molly :)

				Depends how much I eat. It happens to me with extreme amounts, sometimes it can take 3-5 days for me to feel 100% normal. 1st day feel like shit, 2nd day I feel twice as better as the day before but still a little rough, 3rd day I&#039;m usually back to normal. The hangover feeling mentally isn&#039;t too bad for me, it&#039;s the physical ailments that really fuck me and sometimes take at least a full week to heal. Such shit as swollen taste buds which I think is from chain smoking while rolling, canker sores from gurning while sleeping, feeling dehydrated, and very occasionally it can make me feel sick with cold sweats.

				I always have an afterglow after using MDMA. Such a happy and content feeling the day after. My Tuesday Blues consists of feeling tired and a bit cut off from my feelings. Not depressed. <br />I get really bad with gurning... my mouth is always such a mess!

Make sure to get Magnesium Chelate or Magnesium Citrate. Magnesium Oxide is not nearly as effective. Cn get it at GNC or over the counter at your local supplement store. Taken a few hours before the roll virtually eliminates all jaw clenching. I have found anywhere from ~750 mg to ~1200 mg to be effective.

				Terrible tuesdays are usually non-existent for me while using mdma. Idk if its covered by an afterglow but typically feel great after I eat something, take 5-htp, and vitamin c. MDA on the other hand, terrible tuesday are in full effect. I feel like the biggest piece of shit ever and cannot get out of bed for like 2 days no matter how much 5-htp, vitamin c, and food i eat. It legit kicks your ass. But the feelings on MDA &gt; MDMA. I dont care for the lovey dovey feelings but the crazy euphoria and wanna dance feeling that mda gives. Also the visuals on mda are crazy.

				...I usually feel like shit the next day .and fine the day after...I always use the 5-htp for the next several days after the roll....The last one i took &quot;Red Questionmarks&quot; i had a pretty good terrible tuesday going.My friend who took one with me ,had one as well..But we were also drinking,and i was doing oxycontin all day that day.<br /><br />So now in my older age..When using pills ,i usually expect a shitty day the next day...So now when purhcasing and reading the reports..One of the most important noted aspects to me is the &quot;Hangover&quot;..This is one of the reasons ,i bought so many and was ok paying more for the Defqons.....Several users report &quot;no hangover&quot;,a big selling point for me...Used to bounce back in my younger years and not really pay it much concern,but now i&#039;d rather pay more and avoid the hangover if i can.....

				I used to get this when i was chompin on bunk pipes and other shit pills, but with MDMA/MDA the most i get is that &quot;hollow&quot; feeling... My older friends get these sporadic mood swings after multiple rolls however, but i feel like us young bucks dont have as much to worry about as long as our bodies are typically chemically sound... The magnesium/vitamin C precursor is a GREAT tip! As for vanquishing hangovers here is a good tip that works wonders for me- 5HTP (generally a small dose) with a glass of chocolate milk (replenishes fats, proteins, and sugars lots whilst raging face) and a banana or two (helps cut down cramping the next day) This takes me from zombie to spriteley in no time &lt;3

				I started using Mg and 5-HTP when I was rolling once a week or so. I gurn so bad I cracked a couple of molars and my depression was getting to my friends. They said they&#039;d stop doing drugs with me if I didn&#039;t do something about it.<br />I stopped pre and post loading when I stopped regularly using. I get the mid-week blues about a week later and it can be pretty awful. My jaw is also so sore that I can hardly open it, much less think about chewing anything harder than soup. Of course, I&#039;ve also regularly bit my tounge and cheek enough to bleed with gum. Def getting some Mg for this festival. I forget how miserable this is!

				I used to feel great ALWAYS after rolling.. <br /><br />A thousand pills later.. different story. <br />Now when I roll I feel fucked in the head for days. I can be in a depressed funk for a good 3 or 4 days before my serotonin monster in mah head comes back to life. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried taking 5htp but have heard mixed reviews. <br />Tuesday blues? Why not try rolling up some of that stanky blue grass and smoke yourself&nbsp; back to normal. Trees are the only remedy for me anymore..&nbsp;

				Except for my first time ever rolling, I&#039;ve always felt a nice afterglow the following day (I preload like a motherfucker). I don&#039;t really notice ever feeling down or moody, but what I do get most of the time is pretty extreme nausea 2 days after rolling. I&#039;ve discovered that if I pop some dramamine before going to bed the day after rolling, I can bypass the debilitating nausea. No one else I know has ever experienced this nausea issue as an after effect-- I&#039;m curious if anyone here has ever dealt with it?
