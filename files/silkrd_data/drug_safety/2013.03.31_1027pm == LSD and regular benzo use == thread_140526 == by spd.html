				Just wondering if regular (daily) benzo use (diaz in particular - ie long half-life) would have a significant impact on the effects of LSD.&nbsp; I know you can abort/tame a trip with benzos - but will the stuff just built up in my system dampen the experience if I don&#039;t take any benzos that day?&nbsp; <br /><br />Last time I took a hit, it felt more like 50ug than the purported 100ug - but that seemed like a common complain on that particular vendor&#039;s product.&nbsp; If there is an effect, should I just up the dose a bit?<br /><br />

				Benzos destroy the LSD trip, at least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard.<br />I&#039;ve heard of people taking Xanax to get out of a bad trip.

Took more 2c-p and by then the 10-15mg of Xanax was starting to wear off. I quickly started feeling the 2c-p before the second dose was even starting, ended up sitting there tripping my ballz off for about 30 hours, it just was not letting off so dosed some more Xanax too join my friends in sleeping.<br />Basically they don&#039;t work together you will need to be sober for psychedelics to truly work there magic&nbsp; :P <br />So don&#039;t take any Valium that day and try have less the day before or preferably none. <br />Enjoy&nbsp; ;D

				I take klonopin semi-regularly, I always make sure to not take any the day before or the day of the trip.<br /><br />And yes benzos work amazingly well in getting out of a bad trip.

				Only problem for me is if I don&#039;t take a nightly dose of val, I&#039;ll probably be pretty damn nervous going into the trip.&nbsp; I dont plan on being high when I start tripping, It&#039;d be a good 12 hours or so since a dose, and don&#039;t want to take any during the trip.&nbsp; Part of the reason for the trip is to contemplate my usage, lsd did wonders in helping me slow down on excessive drinking.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll just try to take a little less val day before, and see what happens, i would hate to waste what are supposed to be high-quality tabs from a trusted vendor.<br /><br />

If you stop benzo&#039;s that keep your anxiety in check and then take lsd, i&#039;d assume there is a high risk of getting into a bad trip since you go in anxious already and that is likely to be amplified.<br /><br />If you already have a tolerance i suppose it would be best to take your benzo&#039;s as you usually do and try the lsd regardless. The result may or may not be disappointing, but not tripping at all is just a waste of money. Getting a bad trip due to benzo withdrawal combined with hallucinogens may have long lasting implications.

				Thanks Ben, that&#039;s probably the best advice I&#039;ve gotten, and gonna go with that.&nbsp; If I went days w/o taking any benzos, the last thing I would want to do is trip.<br /><br />If the dosage works - I&#039;m not anticipating a bad trip, but I do expect that it might be a difficult ride at times (it has been in the past), but helpful in the long run.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have any serious WDs during the trip, due to valium&#039;s long half-life, but if things do get out of hand, I can always take some (though I&#039;d rather try to ride it out).<br /><br />If it seems weak, and everyone else on here is raving bout the tabs, I guess I know I&#039;ll just have to save em for another time.

				There is nothing weak about being sensible with these things. <br /><br />Valium has a very&nbsp; long half life indeed, but it will still decrease in concentration by half every 24 hours or so. Tripping while that is going on is just a bad idea.
