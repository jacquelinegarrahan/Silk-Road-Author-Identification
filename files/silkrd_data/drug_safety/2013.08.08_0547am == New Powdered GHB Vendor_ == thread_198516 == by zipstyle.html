				Im also bothered by this. It seems that GHB overall has became rare. Even the liquids are mostly from flagged countries(for me), so it&#039;s nearly impossible to get GHB from anywhere. And since BG has lot of work ahead of him, i have bad feeling his not going to be around for a while. <br />I even made my own thread about lack of GHB some while ago:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201010.msg1479860#msg1479860<br /><br />But powder would be better than liquid.

				Wellness sells powder GHB from the Netherlands at awesome prices. The reviews are good so I imagine it&#039;s good GHB, and at those prices even if it&#039;s less pure the value is better. Only downside is that is comes from NL. <br /><br />Everythingman also sells some at decent prices from Poland but there aren&#039;t any reviews for that product and his other reviews aren&#039;t all good.

Im sure many NL vendors also know that their business is limited by their country and this would help them as well. <br /><br />I have now made three orders from NL without receiving anything, so there is no point trying anymore. If i want any GHB at the moment MarijuanaIsMyMuse is my only option. Does anyone have experience of him? Or is there any new options?

				mixed review here. don&#039;t expect BG. i had take about 2 full droppers at a time to get the effect i was going for and at some point i just started pouring it into shots of lemonade. that&#039;s what it took to nod off. i woke up with some nausea and had to hit the head. nothing heavy, but i don&#039;t like puking. <br />the upside is that i found someone to freak out (after a shower and brush of teeth) with and i&#039;m still feeling that part. the downside is that i went through the whole vial.<br />

				Extremely pleased with zrem order.&nbsp; The potency is fantastic.&nbsp; He stated 1g:1ml concentration in PMs, and the dropper is 1ml, and 4 droppers once at bedtime and once at 2AM gets a perfect night&#039;s sleep (which is what I like this for). 4g + 4g of BG&#039;s did the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 16 oz is 1.77 BTC right now.&nbsp; That&#039;s like 472 droppersfull, or 2 months&#039; worth at 8ml/night.&nbsp; At that price quantity is way more than BG&#039;s.&nbsp; Nice and clean, and it comes in a nice amber thick glass bottle with another smaller bottle and glass dropper.&nbsp; Pro all the way around.&nbsp; Super fast shipping and communicative vendor.&nbsp; Will be patronizing again.

				about zrem review:<br />my conscience drives me to point out that my memories of BG stock are colored by the effects of capsules full of GSC Co2 oil i was eating at the time. I also feel the need to emphasize that going through the whole 2oz in 12 hours has more to do with my personality and was totally unnecessary. zrem still seems like a little bit &#039;lighter&#039; on the euphoria but would expect it to satisfy as a sleep aid/romance enhancer/comedown pillow and last a while. despite being a little pricey i&#039;ll probably end up ordering again and i&#039;m definitely curious to read about what other people think about the listing.

				I received from Zrem a few days ago. I only have had BG&#039;s GHB before this but I feel Zrem has very high quality GHB as well. It seems to be pretty much pure as he says. It is cheaper dose for dose though and ships domestic for me :) I use GHB as a replacement for alcohol and not so much for sleep so YMMV.<br /><br />I will keep Zrem fanned so I can buy from him again. 5/5 from me.

As a newbie you could take 1-2g and then 45 minutes later if you feel like you need more, take another 1g, when you reach 3-4g, I would redose in 0.5g increments because the dose-response curve starts getting pretty steep at this point.
