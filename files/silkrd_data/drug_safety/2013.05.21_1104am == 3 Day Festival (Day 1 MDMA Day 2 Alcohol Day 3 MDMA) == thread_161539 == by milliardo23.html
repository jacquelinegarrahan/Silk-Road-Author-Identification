				Ok so I bought some orange tri forces and I was thinking about rolling 2 days for EDC<br /><br />I have lil tolerance so maybe 2-3 a DAY since it&#039;s 7pm-5am<br /><br />Day 1 MDMA Day 2 Alcohol Day 3 MDMA<br /><br />I was also looking into 2-CB and Methylone as well, I&#039;m BROKE so max I can get is like 1-2 each....<br />I see nawlins selling some for very cheap for like .04 btc atm and it&#039;s in U.S<br /><br />If I were to get 2-cb or methylone would I burn out my serotonin as much as I would if I were to roll 2 days out of 3? <br /><br />P.S I&#039;m not too into trees or lsd<br />

Mate I wouldn&#039;t touch methylone if you got good MDMA. A good mix with MDMA for me is some high grade cannabis. Alcohol is different with MDMA. And so is ket. All good combinations with MDMA. Cannabis will just keep taking you higher and higher. And methylone is bad on the heart. Vasoconstriction like mad if you keep redosing. Enjoy the festival and play safe

				not a fan of mdma on the first day...it can fuck up your serotonin levels for the rest of the festival<br /><br />dont have any exp. taking 2-cb prior mdma, but from what i understand it works as a serotonin agonist<br />and doesnt empty your actual serotonin levels like mdma does. i guess you should be fine. but i could be wrong. personally i would go for ketamine,opium,lsd,speed,coke the first days and consume md on the last one<br /><br /><br />cheers minchia

				Last year I had the exact same recipe. I popped a about .2 mdma the first day and took a pink star. Was going to drink heavily the second day, but i got there right when it got shut down (just my luck)&nbsp; :-[, and the third day i took one and a half white guccis. I was having a pretty bad time the third day, because a) my brain was already pretty depleted and b) I had drank a little too much and the heat kinda got to me. However, I smoked two joints and I immediately felt amazing. It wasn&#039;t my typical rolling experience where I just wanna sit down and talk with everyone, instead I got completely entranced in the music and danced for 5 hours straight, something I&#039;ve never done before. It was an amazing expereince. Weed will do amazing things towarsd the end of ur roll or if ur just not into it that much so I highly suggest it. This is coming from someone who hates smoking weed regularly too, as I find it makes me socially awkward and uncomforatble. But not when I&#039;m rolling. As for this year:<br />Day 1: 115-20 mg mda<br />Day 2: Alcohol weed wee bit of coke maybe<br />Day 3: 125-50 mg mdma<br />Master shulgin and many others claim little to no cross tolerance between mda and mdma, so I&#039;m gonna test that out. Keep the doses small and your bound to have a good time. Its edc for crying out loud. see u in the desert&nbsp; 8)

				Not really an answer to your question but I&nbsp; usually try to drink with coke 1st night, MDMA or pills 2nd night and coke drink with an afterglow from the night before on the last day/night.<br /><br />The one year I did all of the above and pills on the 3 nights, I suffered badly for a week afterwards! Maybe your idea is good though doing them 1st and 3rd!<br /><br />I try to stick to my rule of only popping pills on one of the nights. Pick who ya wanna see most to be on pills and use them that night.<br /><br />Tri-Force are strong too so too many of them would lash your serotonin out of it!<br /><br />Enjoy anyway&nbsp; :)
