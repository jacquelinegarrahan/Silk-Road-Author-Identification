				Hey guys, first &quot;real&quot; post, but long time lurker.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ve been buying the alprazolam powder for a month or so now (from pharmacypowder of course, gotta give a little shoutout here -- great quality &amp; prices).&nbsp; Rather than investing in a $1000+ scale to measure out doses, I have taken the liquid solution approach.&nbsp; I generally&nbsp; do a 100 pill batch at a time: 100mg (0.1g) in 50mL of Everclear.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using size 1 or 0 hard gelatin capsules and putting 0.5mL of the solution into each (works out to be 1mg/capsule).&nbsp; They seem to hold the liquid fine and rarely leak.&nbsp; The only problem I am having, is some seem to be stronger/weaker than others.&nbsp; I was wondering if I was making a mistake anywhere.&nbsp; I generally shake the solution quite vigorously for a few minutes before distributing into the capsules.&nbsp; Should I be heating the solution and giving it a few hours for the solute to dissipate effectively?&nbsp; This could&nbsp; potentially eliminate &quot;hot spots&quot; and weak areas in the solution.<br /><br />Also, I tried the propylene glycol approach.&nbsp; Same steps as the Everclear solvent.&nbsp; These actually seemed to be a little more potent (always a positive).&nbsp; The only flaw is the propylene glycol seems to make the hard gelatin caps extremely brittle (break/snap with the slightest pressure).&nbsp; I was wondering if any of you have found another way to contain the PG.&nbsp; Soft shell capsules seem plausible, but to my knowledge, you cannot buy any that can be opened and resealed.<br /><br />Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any helpful input&nbsp; :)

				As long as you are getting a real solution with the everclear, just regular stirring/mixing will suffice to get an equal distribution of xanax through the batch. <br /><br />The question probably is if you are getting a true solution, or something that resembles one but actually is not. If you manage to dissolve the tablets completely you should have a clear liquid, nothing precipitating to the bottom or floating to the top. This is not always that easy to see however. One thing you could do is leave your solution over night in a sealed container and see if it still looks clear and even the day after. <br /><br />The solubility of alprazolam in water/alcohol mixtures increases with temperature, so do not put the solution into the fridge or anything like that. Just leave it on a tabletop at room temperature but covered with a stopper/lid/shrinkwrap for a night.

				Appreciate the reply.&nbsp; I feel pretty confident I&#039;m receiving pure alprazolam judging by other Silk Roaders&#039; reviews, a lab result someone posted, and personal powder uses.&nbsp; I&#039;ve started letting the solution sit in a bowl of nearly-boiling water to help the dissolving process, and this seems to help along with constant shaking while feeling up the pills.<br /><br />I still wish there was a capsule that could hold propylene glycol without any deterioration of the capsule.

				Capsules like that may be available, but you&#039;d have to experiment.<br /><br />None of them are designed to withstand your solvent, but in the range of stomach acid resistant ones you may be able to identify one that does. <br />

				The PG will suck the moisture out of the caps, that is why they are brittle.

				Perhaps, if that is the problem, try adding some water to the solvent mixture. PG and water are completely miscible, although adding too much water will reduce the solubility of alprazolam.
