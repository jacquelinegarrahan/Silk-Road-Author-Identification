				What do you mean by &quot;refrigerator water&quot;? Like tap water that has been left in the refrigerator?<br /><br />If it is, then I doubt there&#039;s any difference between the two.<br /><br />Your best bet is recently boiled water. Or at least boil some tap water in the spoon. Obviously, if you can get bacteriostatic water, then use that.

It&#039;s the additives. I&#039;ve been in Australia and the tap water there smells of chlorine. You don&#039;t want chlorine in your bloodstream. The majority of American (USA) municipal water sources are contaminated with fluoride. You don&#039;t want fluoride in your bloodstream.

				You might have a well, though, which would eliminate any chance of flouride or chlorine or anything. I have a well so it&#039;s not outside the realm of possibility.

				OMG needles,&nbsp; &nbsp;no!<br /><br />OMG I am too scared of shooting up. <br /><br />OMG I know that people would think I was some kind of junkie if I was to casually shoot-up-the-mainline-IV as if I were simply having a cup of coffee or sum thing.<br />I guess it is just a case of cultural taboos and pre/miss-conceptions.<br /><br />But if I had too I guess I would go with a boiled kettle that had been allowed to cool to around 36 degrees celcius. For sterility purposes.<br /><br />Or maybe distilled water might, as suggested, be better. Would it be better to boil it first just to be on the safe side?<br /><br />Or just ditch the needles man and whack it up ya hooter like innit!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, I am afraid of needles but will let a trained professional inject stuff into me if necessary for medical reasons.

				Yeah. I&#039;m in a new location, so my IV use has gone down tremendously. I thank Buddha for that. Also with SR I figure the drugs are cleaner (as in literally cleaner) than I would find on the street.

				It depends on what you want really. In many western countries tap water is quite sterile as it is, though in some substances are added.<br /><br />For IV use you may want to prefer physiological salt over plain water though. This can be prepared by adding 9 grams per litre to pure water (tap, or distilled if your tap water is bad) and boiling it for 10 minutes or so. <br /><br />Using only water in an IV is not without dangers: the sudden drop in osmotic pressure can cause a number of red cells to lyse, possibly leading to clotthing factors being released in response. If you are unlucky those cloths could end up in bad places. Crazy as it sounds, shooting up 10 ml of perfectly sterile, ultrapure, water can actually be deadly.

IV bags contain an isotonic solution of salt in water, often augmented with some extra ingredients such as potassium salts to be compatible with your blood. Emptying a half liter bag of pure water through and IV would most probably be fatal.<br /><br />With IV drug use. using a syringe. the injected volume is&nbsp; much smaller, and it will usually mix with the blood plasma before anything dramatic happens. Injecting something like 1 ml of water, or even 10 ml when done slowly, will not trigger an immediate red cell bursting clotting response as long as it is into a vein that has proper circulation. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather err on the side of caution with that though, and suggest using 0,9% saline as the solvent. It only takes one single mistake to kill you while the solution to avoiding that is readily available.&nbsp;

				In Russia you can always buy a special water for injections, the sell it packed in ampules, in any drug store. I don&#039;t see a reason why would they not sell it anywhere in the world. Ever tried asking this in drugstores?

				Its not very common in the western world to sell it in ampoules. Most injectable medications come in their own buffer solution and are ready to inject as-is. <br /><br />IV fluid usually comes in bags designed to be hooked to an IV line, but the composition is probably the same as that of the ampoules, it just comes in a larger volume. In medical terms these are often referred to as &#039;saline bags&#039;, and they are pretty cheap.
