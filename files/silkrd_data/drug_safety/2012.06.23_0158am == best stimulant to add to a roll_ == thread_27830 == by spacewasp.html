				just wondering your opinions.<br /><br />never done 4-FA, but am thinking this could be a good one?&nbsp; I just want a little bit, like something that would yeild the effect of 5mg of adderall...enough to keep people off the chairs.&nbsp; or maybe just a little caffeine is all it needs?&nbsp; does anyone here sell powdered caffeine?<br /><br />suggestions welcome

				Careful with combinations...<br /><br />IMHE the best drug to combine with x is small doses of very pure cocaine.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry to much about the amount just be careful not to ingest more than your comfortable with @ the timee...

				definitely not going with cocaine.&nbsp; i don&#039;t think its very effective orally in low doses, plus I don&#039;t want to buy that overpriced garbage which victimizes everyone involved in its production and sale.<br /><br />i just want to add a tiny little kick to a roll...

				Get some MDA to go along with your roll.&nbsp; it has a speediness to it, but also is very similar to mdma.<br /><br />

				I would recommend Amp/speed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there&#039;s usually meth in bombs. Meth is pretty spendy, where as amp is rather cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />on the note of 4-fa. I really like it&#039;s wake-ful qualities at ~20mg.&nbsp; I have only used it once recreationally, however i like to dose 20mg or so at the beginning of a day for 8-10 hours of wakeful energy.&nbsp; not bursting with energy and need to dance or anything, just very awake and aware.&nbsp; I DO notice i sweat alot more than usual and i&#039;m usually in a great mood.&nbsp; When i dosed ~60-80mg i wasn&#039;t as awake or alert, more high like molly where i was lethargic, though my CNS was stimulated.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, my fiance won&#039;t feel a thing on 10-25mg but on 30-40mg she&#039;s lethargic, has difficulty concentrating(i didn&#039;t experience that even on ~80) and while she had a good time, thought it was rather a waste.<br /><br />Just keep in mind it depends on your body chemistry.&nbsp; 4-FA might be a good choice to try, but i definitely think amphetamine would better suit your needs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried any amp from SR, but from everything i&#039;ve read the stuff on here is rather hit and miss, even with reputable vendors.

				i was being entirely serious about adderall/ritalin/vivance etc. theyre often added to ecstasy with caffeine too because on simply mdma people tend to tucker out after only a couple hours. those previous drugs will keep you going
