				&nbsp;<br />A THREE-year-old who ate an LSD-laced sugar cube from her mother&#039;s kitchen thought she was &quot;on fire&quot; and would die.<br /><br />The girl, from Coombabah on the Gold Coast,&nbsp; was rushed to hospital suffering hallucinations, anxiety and convulsions in November, 2011.<br /><br />She initially told her mother she was feeling &quot;big and small&quot; but later at the hospital police overheard the girl begging for help to stop the burning sensation and save her from dying.<br /><br />Court documents revealed the child was heard saying &quot;Mummy, I&#039;m hot. I&#039;m on fire. Help me, mummy&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m going to die&quot;.<br /><br />The girl was sedated and later made a full recovery.<br /><br />A police search of the house revealed clip-seal plastic bags with crystal residue inside.<br /><br />Yesterday, the child&#039;s 25-year-old mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty in the Southport District Court to child cruelty.<br /><br />She was sentenced to a nine-month intensive corrections order, effectively a jail sentence served in the community.<br /><br />Crown prosecutor Nick McGhee said leaving drugs where children could find them was a criminally negligent act.<br /><br />Barrister Stephan McMurray said the mother had been tortured by guilt since the incident and was now only allowed hour-long access visits to her child every fortnight.<br />&nbsp; http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/tot-3-ate-mothers-lsd-sugar/story-fnet08ui-1226612826598#ixzz2Py2y4I89<br />

				She should have got more than that, stupid fuck shouldn&#039;t be allowed to have kids. <br /><br />Quite a funny story though despite that.

Also can be absorbed on the skin. (Think Jimi Hendrix&#039; acid soaked headband)

				when i was 8 years old i sneaked into my parents bedroom, went through all their stuff and found their hidden stash of lsd.<br />i thought, seeing as i was a child, it was some of those kids transfer tattoos, so i put them on my arm.... maybe 5, and licked them to try to get the picture to come off on my skin. when this failed i sneaked into the bathroom and tried to run a bit of water over the trips to allow the picture to come off and give me a lovely strawberry tattoos.<br />well of course this failed so i put the paper in the bin........ lets move along to bedtime...... my god, i saw a&nbsp; spaceship flying around my light, then faces apeared on my wall and all started laughing at me. so i ran into my parents bedroom screaming the faces are laughing at me... mom came to my bedroom and obviously saw nothing but realized what had happened, took me to sleep on the couch downstairs, tried to make me think happy thoughts, any way when we was laying on the couch i saw a lady laying across the book shelf, she was smoking and i remember the ash from her cigarette falling onto the couch, so i rubbed it, it smudged leaving a big black mark on the couch. <br />finally when i fell asleep and woke up the mark was gone..... for years i never understood that night until i started to take acid, then things started to become clear &quot;i took my first trip when i was 8!!!!!!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; :o <br />ok, i was not 3 years old, and who knows how that child will be in the future, but in my case i dont feel it has effected me in a bad way, im a very well rounded adult, i dont have any issues you might expect from a child taking such a strong substance.<br /><br />just thought i would share my childhood experience as a few people are saying i wonder how it will effect the child in later life....&nbsp; me, i dont see any long term damage in myself, i have no mental health issuses whats so ever, im actually better then good, im one of the most happy and positive people i know..... so who knows<br />
