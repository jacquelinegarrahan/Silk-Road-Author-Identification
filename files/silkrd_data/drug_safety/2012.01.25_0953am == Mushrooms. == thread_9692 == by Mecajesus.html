				Well I just spent some of my bitcoins on some dope, i was supposed to be spending it on some LSD, for me and three friends of mine, i&#039;m down to about 5.5 bitcoins and don&#039;t want to wait another few weeks for some more.<br /><br />I noticed that an 8th of some shrooms go for about 5 bitcoins and i was just curious if an 8th is enough to get 4 people who are beginners, messed up enough to want to try LSD again?

				I don&#039;t think an 8th is enough for four people. At least half and 8th is needed for a good trip in my experience. Less than a gram is a waste.

				First-timers should start with around 2 grams, anything less wouldn&#039;t be worth it.<br /><br />I have a new vendor sale for 7 grams for $25 if you want. The listing is here: <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/18968

				depends on the cubes really. My first batch I would take about 4g for a crazy trip my new batch I take 1.4g and its equal in intensity if not more.

				If you&#039;re looking at shrooms on SR, I can tell you that an 8th of Rocker&#039;s shrooms should be enough for a light-moderate trip for two people, but definitely not enough for four people. In my experience, 1.5g (for reference, half an 8th is 1.75g) was enough for open-eye visuals, a little bit of closed-eye visuals, time dilation, and very light synesthesia. YMMV, but I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re going to need closer to a 4th for that many people.
