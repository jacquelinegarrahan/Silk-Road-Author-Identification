				I&#039;d like some #4 but none is available in my country and I only order domestic. If I were to get some #3 and add some hydrochloric acid would it produce #4?<br /><br />If so how much should I use for say 0.25g of #3?

				You can make #4 from #3 but using .25 would leave you with nothing in the end. You need more like 5 grams to make it at all worthwhile and even then youd probably only end up with 1 gram if your lucky and have good chemistry knowledge.

				So can you make No3 H from No4 H, bought some but i think i was mis-informed, was told to put manitol or caffein, but when i did that tasted like shit on the foil, dark lines and tasted like acid, nothing like a good No3 H. any advice please?

				you cant just take number 4 and cut it to produce #3 because its been converted to the salt form. #3 is freebase, which is easier to convert to salt for dissolving in water than it is to do the reverse.&nbsp; <br /><br />smoking #4 is extremely inefficient because the vaporization and combustion temperature are too close, most of the H is wasted. the freebase #3 form vaporizes before it burns and degrades...&nbsp; cutting will help the vaporization but still most of the #4 will be wasted.

				Why exactly do you want to do this?<br /><br />it is entirely possible to buy some HCl solution, dilute it, dissolve #3 in it, evaporate the water completely, dry the compound, and you will be left with #4. It won&#039;t be any purer, whiter, more soluble in water, or better for administration in any way though. when dope is mostly filler (which it is), its the filler that determines its solubility, color, strength, and purity, and this removes none of that. <br /><br />purification of said #3/#4 is a different process entirely.<br /><br />Why does heroin #4 seem &quot;better&quot; than #3? because the process of conversion most typically used includes a purification step.

				I wanted to do it as I heard that #4 is better for snorting and I wanted to try that. It doesn&#039;t seem worth it from the information I&#039;ve been given though.
