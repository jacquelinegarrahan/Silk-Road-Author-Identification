				hey guys, I&#039;ve recently stumbled upon someone selling a drug known as DOM. It is purportedly very similiar to LSD, and according to erowid, lasts for 12-24 hours. Can anyone give me some more info about this drug? I&#039;m assuming it is part of the DO family. I&#039;ve tried DOB before. I had some good experiences and some bad experience with it. When you take it in the daytime with friends it can be pretty fun, but when you take DOB by yourself at like 10 at night, its not that fun. First two hours waiting for it to kick in, the next hour enjoying the trip, and then the next 24 hours wishing the trip would end haha. Although I did enjoy DOB the first couple of times i did it, most people in my area wanted nothing to do with it, due to the sheer craziness of the trip. What are the differences between DOM and DOB?

				I think DOM seems quite interesting. <br /><br />Read this in Pihkal (Clearnet): <br />http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal068.shtml<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(with 4 mg) The first four hours were largely directed to the body. There was a shuddering, and a tight jaw, and I am not particularly motivated to talk to anyone. It is more arousing (like amphetamine) than depressing (like phenobarb). I am feeling just a little sick at the three hour point, but a bit of regurgitation clears this up. Then at the fourth hour, it went totally outside of me. I saw the clouds towards the west. THE CLOUDS!!! No visual experience has ever been like this. The meaning of color has just changed completely, there are pulsations, and pastels are extremely pastel. And now the oranges are coming into play. It is a beautiful experience. Of all past joys, LSD, mescaline, cannabis, peyote, this ranks number one. Normally I have no color effects with mescaline. A dynamic experience. Feels good, too. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have tried neither DOM, nor DOB, but of all the DOxes, this one peaks my curiosity :)

				I know little of its effects, but it was one of the first drugs Shulgin ever invented. At the time it was the second most potent psychedelic known to science (after LSD), and for a period it was commonly used in biochemical and neurological research. It was a (if not the) source of &#039;bad acid&#039; in the late 60s, but it seems worthwhile if you have the time for it.

				Sounds somewhat similar to DOC which I&#039;ve tried. Could be interesting but if it&#039;s pricier than the other DOx compounds I&#039;m not sure it would be worth it.

				DOM is one of the so-called &quot;Magical Half Dozen.&quot;&nbsp; Never had the.pleasure, but if it&#039;s on the list, it&#039;s a worthwhile compound.&nbsp; Would jump on some if it appeared on SR, and I would be willing to pay a premium due to its status.<br /><br />My understanding is that you have to be patient with the come up, which can take several hours.&nbsp; Redosing by impatient or ignorant users has led to bad experiences and hospitalizations.<br />

				I think gammagoblin is going to be selling some on SR soon, that is where i heard about the chemical. Prices are a lot less expensive than LSD, but maybe expensive for a research chemical. After reading all these posts im intrigued to try some. Hopefully its not as much of a creepy trip as DOB was

				a newbie user &quot;norvillerogers&quot; sent me a message describing his DOM experiences so i thought id post it here,<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve tried DOM on a few occasions. First time I took DOM i took one hit that had a 3micro gram drop on it (very bitter, not like acid). I proceeded to see My Bloody Valentine in 3D (terrible remake, terrible movie, just terrible). I felt barely anything. Then I forgot about the rest of the sheet i bought, and two years later i found it. I decided to save it for just a little longer as i was goin back to school and had my own place. First week back i think &quot;hey, I&#039;ll pop some before bed and wake up trippin&quot;. I took 6. never was able to get to bed either out of excitement or just not tired. an hour later I think I&#039;ll take another two cause its old and i figured the dose dissipated some. It didnt. in about three hours i start my trip, and being alone in my dark room i start to drift. Soon enough I am engulfed by very opaque colors (like the hippie color burst design, but fainter in coloring). I am completely melted into my bed, and i just roll around in it for seemingly hours. Then of course i forget that it is synthesized with amphetamine properties so not only am i trippin but i am high on energy. unfortunately that does work well with the mind. i&#039;ve candyflipped and hippie flipped and even a concoction me and my roommate later came up with: SLEDding (Shroom, LSD, ecstasy, and DOM), and these were no where near as crazy on the brain as this was. The only thing I could compare it to would be when i dropped 30mg of 2C-I. Taking this high of a dose (8 hits) of DOM was so much that I never even thought to listen to music. I was so far gone in my own head i couldnt work my phone. SO, the moral of this whole story is, don&#039;t do too much and just cause you can handle LSD or other combinations it does not mean you can handle this. The amphetamine rush you get is enough to set you off on a bad trip. DOM is also known as STP...Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace. So it is easy to get lost in what you do, where you are...more so than LSD. Have a plan of attack before you take it. No two psychs are the same. :)&quot;
