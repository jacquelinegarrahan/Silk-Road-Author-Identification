				Just thought about this. I didn&#039;t have any access to drugs before my SR time. What about you? Did anyone become addicted to a drug which wouldn&#039;t have been the case without SR? For example heroine, meth, speed etc.?

				I&#039;m not addicted, but I certainly tried drugs I never thought I&#039;d try due to SR.<br /><br />But ultimately someone that is dumb enough to let themselves get addicted to smack from SR, would have done something fucked up in place of that even if they didn&#039;t have the heroin.

				Luckily I don&#039;t have an addictive personality but thanks to SR I have tried several different wonderful drugs I normally wouldn&#039;t have access to. I have seen users post on the forums venting their frustrations about the shipping times because they&#039;re going through withdrawals and they get frustrated with the vendor so I don&#039;t doubt there are many SR users feeding their addictions, but you can&#039;t blame anyone except that person. There&#039;s a difference between a user and an abuser.

				Nope.<br /><br />I smoked everyday before I came here. I can buy hash here which is less potent that what we get here&nbsp; ;D You need that foreign import clean hash as you can take a break from the hard hitting shit we grow in the UK.<br /><br />I got MDMA off here. Took it twice in 4 months,<br /><br />Anything else so far I am just glad to have now and again. Benzos come in handy. In the past I would stay up all night after stimulants. Now I cam grab some shut eye. <br /><br />Its real life that brings addictions.<br /><br />Could SR enable some addictions? Yes.<br /><br />But better to buy vetted products and even meds to help you ease off various addictive substances. We have vendors here selling harm reduction. <br /><br />Addiction is just life&#039;s circumstances. You lose a wife, kids, house, parents, inherit cash and might get addicted.

				You&#039;re all in denial.&nbsp; ;D fucking addicts<br /><br /><br />SR did quite the opposite for me. I was addicted before I showed up here, but&nbsp; reading through SR forums and ingesting Holly&#039;s nice gift of LSD helped me to learn a few things about myself: I am an addict because I suffer from a terrible combination of impulsiveness and compulsiveness. After this realization, I admitted to myself that I shouldn&#039;t go near highly addictive substances until I can develop moderation and self-control. Honestly this probably would never have happened had I not been arrested... I imagine I&#039;d still be getting barred out drinking OEs and falling asleep with a loaded pistol aimed at my dome.

				Seems like a good thing to addicts. This place maintains quality control, so you&#039;re not going to get any dealers like the one I&#039;ve heard of who say... lace weed with cocaine so you keep coming to them. also, if you&#039;re going through one sort of withdrawl, this site provides access to willpower increasing drugs like adderall and methylphenidate. Not to mention the supportive and experienced community here.

				Ironically enough, I find myself addicted to SR itself. I get a buzz out of buying my Bitcoin, and then waiting for it to be added to my account. All the anxiety along the way wondering about all the things that could go wrong!<br /><br />Then the buzz gets better when I place an order for whatever drug I fancy, and the climax is when it arrives at my door and it is mine to use as I please :-)

I&#039;m sure most people are busy trying different strains of cannabis or experimenting with psychedelics, but obviously there&#039;s the choice to try these harder drugs.

				Answer to the question: No.<br /><br />But almost addicted, to benzo&#039;s. Certainly withdrawals. But I&#039;ve figured myself out now, my dose is way down and it is comforting knowing that SR will be there for me, when I need it. <br /><br />Thanks to all the honest sellers who stand up again a world full of ignorant lawmakers and brainwashed voters.

				Nope, I have chiefed everything since high school, except meth. Never really considered to be that addicted to anything, but coke &amp; cigs. Drinking&#039;s more of a problem in my mind. The Silk Road just provides quality products at a price tho. Trouble with the law, steep prices over all, and a chance of just not getting shit.

I&#039;ve had a history of drug addiction, battled it out and got myself off most substances previous to finding the Silk Road. I came to SR in search of DMT and DMT I did find. I&#039;ve certainly increased psychedelic use, but far from a dangerous level. Strangely enough the things that keep me coming back are the great community and knowledge shared here... okay and the DMT. In all honesty though while much of this information existed on the internet before SR, I would have never gotten so interested and spent so much time researching this information if I hadn&#039;t joined the community here. I believe I have substantially increased my knowledge (though I have much to still learn) about the substances available here and as a result of my psychedelic use have also increased my knowledge of myself. I enjoy much more peace now than the time I spent while in my previous addictions or the time I spent stone-cold-sober previously. I also focus more on positive aspects of my life instead of how to avoid falling into &#039;old&#039; thinking patterns, this has helped me immensely. <br /><br />For all of this, I thank you the Silk Road. And everyone involved here.

				I think the fact that you have to wait for your drug takes away from the impulsiveness of it, you can&#039;t just go and score whenever you want. But I guess you might buy in larger amounts than what you&#039;re used to so that aspect might be counteracted

				I don&#039;t have an addictive personality, but a compulsive one... if that makes sense.

				No way.<br /><br />Its the other way around actually. Getting good pure quality products I take far less than the street junk.<br /><br />Most addiction is people chasing a high.

After this realization, I admitted to myself that I shouldn&#039;t go near highly addictive substances until I can develop moderation and self-control. Honestly this probably would never have happened had I not been arrested... I imagine I&#039;d still be getting barred out drinking OEs and falling asleep with a loaded pistol aimed at my dome. But I&#039;m probably just saying all this so I can act like getting arrested was somehow beneficial to my life. Eh.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Getting arrested for me was beneficial, i can agree. I was just lucky enough to still be under 18 at the time so thus my life is not ruined once i have learnt my lesson.( I used to steal allot from young started small became very addicted to rush of getting away ended up getting caught finally at 17 braking in houses stealing cars, I was an animal)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wish I got roped when I was 17 maaaaan.... Unfortunately this was not the case =\ oh well, wat is wat is

I&#039;m sure that drives plenty of people to the underground market at some point.<br /><br />This is not specific to SR though, its just another marketplace that is often more practical then the street, and more reliable then the online pharmacies you can find with google.<br /><br />I suppose benzo&#039;s rarely cause much of a problem though, as you can function well when taking them regularly. I think they should be a prime candidate to be legalized. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s possible, but the wait between packages would probably be a deterrence. I suppose you could go find an IRL dealer if you ran out between orders.

				Okay, I tried Heroin yesterday, and Meth today. Why? Simply because it&#039;s my body and I want to know how these things feel, however reading RD&#039;s thread about H and how it keeps up on you has put me off it, despite the nice feeling I got from railing it.<br /><br />As for the Meth, I live in the UK and there&#039;s no domestic Meth, I hate making too many orders from different countries. So yet again, that won&#039;t become habit forming. <br /><br />These forums are my addiction at the moment, I&#039;d rather go on here than go on Facebook&nbsp; ;D.

				I hope you do realize the addictive potential of meth and heroin though.<br />&nbsp;<br />Opiates like heroin have been avaikabke on the streets of eurpoe for as long as i can remember, and the adverse effects have been evident for ages. Meth is a drug that is mostly popular in the US, and in my opinion not something&nbsp; we want to see in europe at all. I don&#039;t want to tell anyone what to do, or what not to, but if you are in europe i&#039;d seriously reconsider meth - i don&#039;t think of it like a preferable drug, but more like a dangerous alternative that was developed under US DEA breakdown.

				I like the replies I see here. This is what responsible drug use looks like. Anyone has the potential to have an addictive personality, and that addictive personality is not only expressed through drug usage. As hard as it is for non-users to imagine many users are responsible in their usage, and some have uncontrollable addictive personality traits. I&#039;ve tried things I wouldn&#039;t otherwise has access to because of SR. Drugs have inherent addictive properties because of the influence they have on the brain and body. Pussy is addictive but you can&#039;t get it on SR....yet.
