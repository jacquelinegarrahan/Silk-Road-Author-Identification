				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for names of medications which have effects similar to LSD and which I can buy without prescription in pharmacy.<br />I would be grateful if someone also tell me what doses are appropriate for me ( 17yo; f ).<br /><br />PS If it has any relevance I&#039;ll add that I&#039;m from Eastern Europe and it would be great when someone know which medications is available in this area.<br /><br />With best wishes ;)

				DXM is the only drug you can buy in the states without a script that has any psychedelic effect at all and it is more of a dissociative. I have never done LSD but I have done shrooms and DXM is not very similar them.<br /><br />Bottom line<br />there is no over the counter drug even similar to LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Edit: I don&#039;t understand words when I am high.

				Yup, nothing close or even far from LSD in pharmaceutics!<br />Your &quot;best&quot; choice for a drug that you can buy in the pharmacy is DXM (dextrometorphan)... You get it in cough syrups! Make sure you choose a syrup with only DXM as active ingredient (advise looking it up online rather than asking the pharmacist)!<br />I also advise reading the *entire* DXM faq, http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/<br />When i was just your age I tried as well, and in a few words i drank a whole bottle (very unpleasant taste) and was set for quite a ride! Fun experience, but one of those you don&#039;t really feel like doing again in my opinion, it was a very very strange feeling and it lasts a long time... Be careful about dosage, maybe a whole bottle might be too much if you are slim!<br />

				Morning glory seeds have LSA in them which is chemically similar to LSD but the trip is very different. It isn&#039;t a medicine but you can get them at flower stores and such.<br /><br />As far as non-prescription drugs go here are your options:<br />1) DXM<br />2) Diphenhydramine (benadryl)<br />3) Dimenhydrinate (dramamine)<br />4) Propylhexedrine(Benzedrex inhalers)<br /><br />All of which are crap, nothing like LSD and can be really dangerous/unhealthy if used incorrectly. Of those listed, DXM is the only one that I enjoyed, but that was many years ago before I knew the difference between good and bad drugs.<br /><br />There are plenty of RCs (research chemicals) such as 2c-i, amt and a million others that are classified as hallucinogens. If your goal is to stay away from &quot;illegal&quot; drugs but want to trip then RCs are probably your best bet. Just be careful.

				Ok - so I probably shouldn&#039;t be sharing this info but I can&#039;t help it. Marazine (a histamine H1 antagonist) is sold over the counter as an air sickness tablet. At least it used to be. Taken in excess (12+) it will produce extreme psychedelic states. Imagine taking mescaline while smoking pcp.&nbsp; It&#039;s heavy. You&#039;ll have conversations with people who aren&#039;t there, eat cookies and smoke cigarettes that don&#039;t exist, launch into a dream state and go running through sprinklers at random golf courses, and show up at your house 6 hours later half-naked and covered in burrs (with dim, maddening, almost shameful recollections of the previous nights happenings). I don&#039;t recommend this without appropriate protective gear. Be safe. Stick with the real thing.
