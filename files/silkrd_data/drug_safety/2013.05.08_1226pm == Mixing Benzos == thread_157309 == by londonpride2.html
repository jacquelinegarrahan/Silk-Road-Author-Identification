				Do other people do this? do you find it makes for a euphoric experience? Is it safe? or is it just a waste? Thoughts on the subject would be welcome. <br /><br />I have some experience of benzos, got nastily addicted but tapered off with Vals without issue (but a lot of determination and maths). <br /><br />I have taken 4mg Xanax, 30mg Temazepam, 10mg of Diaz. Oh and 30 mg of Oxy. Feel nice now :) <br /><br />Even after a few months off the tolerance seems to not go down much, 4mg of Xanax put a mate to sleep for 2 days! <br /><br />PS Man I love SR keep it up DPR! <br /><br />

				Definitely be careful with the opiate+benzo mix.&nbsp; Especially if you have low tolerance to either one of them.&nbsp; I foolishly mixed them A LOT with out really thinking because I was so fucked up all the time.&nbsp; Many times I really should have not waken up but luckily I did probably because I had a very high tolerance to the benzos I was taking.<br /><br />Respiratory depression is very real if you pass out or just fall asleep while on opiates+benzos.&nbsp; That is exactly how some of the actors died when they mixed drugs.&nbsp;

				I used to do snort and smoke a full 60mg opana or two(old formula obviously) a day and I was taking 200+mg of valium at that time.&nbsp; I was also speedballing with a gram of coke or more per day and smoking weed.&nbsp; I was doing this for a while.&nbsp; My god it was fun but so stupid.&nbsp; Finally drank one night on top of all that, got home.&nbsp; Tried taking a piss and was standing in front of the toilet coming in and out of consciousness while standing there, looked at the clock and I realized I was standing there for 40 minutes.&nbsp; Don&#039;t remember anything after that.&nbsp; Had a seizure, slammed my head against the walll, and woke up with my head against the wall, snot, and saliva all over my face.&nbsp; Scary..<br /><br />Obviously I was being a total junkie because I was going through a very hard moment in my life and almost killed my self.&nbsp; <br /><br />Be smart and don&#039;t be like me.

I don&#039;t like to nod if large amounts of benzos are in the mix as I worry about respiratory depression.
