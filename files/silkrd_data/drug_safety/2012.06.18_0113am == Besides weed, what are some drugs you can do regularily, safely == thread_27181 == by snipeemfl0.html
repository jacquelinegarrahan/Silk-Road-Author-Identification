				Besides weed, what other recreational drugs can you do ever 2-4 days SAFELY?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been wondering like swapping around drugs, or is this also a bad idea, because your brain&#039;s chemicals need time to recover?<br /><br />I&#039;ve done 25i-Nbome weekly, and MXE every 5-8 days for a month or so, not any ill effects. Do you think that would be &quot;safe&quot;?<br /><br />

				LSD for sure, although I personally would not wish to do it that frequently. Speaking from a purely physical measure, I don&#039;t think LSD is harmful at all. I really am of the mindset that people can be addicted to almost anything, so use caution when integrating a drug into your life on a routine basis.

				LSD is a powerful drug and not without dangers!<br /><br />sure you will not keel over and die off a blotter but LSD whilst being a key to &#039;free&#039; your mind could also be a key for the local mental health facilities if you jump off the deep edge.<br /><br />I&#039;d say LSD is a once a year thing. Every weekend would be unwise! <br /><br />Hash is cool for everyday.<br /><br />Any cannabis related product is fine.<br /><br />Anything else - on a daily level? Too dangerous really.

				I think the weed/hash cannabis is the only drug that is psychoactive that you can do on a daily basis. I think it is not very good to smoke everyday but this is the ONLY drug that keeps your brain and memory quite intact, even after a hard joints session.<br /><br />ALL the other drugs should be used with caution and each intake should be separated by days.<br /><br />This is available for cocaine, lsd, mdma, 2c<br /><br />And don&#039;t think that alcohol is ok everyday, i put alcohol in the same bag as mdma, meth and all those shit. Alcohol is cool to make a party but it stops there. It is amazing how neurotoxic it is. You don&#039;t remember what you did yesterday, you loose memory very quickly and it is really dangerous for your body from the head to the balls!!.<br /><br />I don&#039;t speak about heroin and crack because there are very very bad drugs! Nothing to get out of it. Just dependency.

				everything on a regular basis is half the fun and twice the cost! If want&nbsp; go with weed but even that can have some secondary effects. different people different bodies but a lot of people cannot handle doing it everyday. <br /><br />LSD is a powerful hallucinogenic. even once a month is too much. It does not hurt your body but it&#039;s a mind altering substance. Acid can be tricky if you overdo it a lot!

				When I got on probation, I was looking to PSYs as my only option, and I thought, &quot;Well fuck yea I&#039;ll just trip balls every weekend.&quot; But after 2 months of doing 2cb, lsd, shrooms, DMT, and then more lsd.... well I could feel it frying my fucking brain. I&#039;m taking a nice long break from psys now. I&#039;m alotting myself one more trip this summer and no more. <br /><br />It&#039;s really hard when there&#039;s been ridiculous white on white going around my town for the last 3 months though lol First time I&#039;ve ever come across real L in my city, and it&#039;s at a really amazing price @525/sheet. But my mind was suffering from all the psychedelia... Def not something to do regularly.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t think anything should be done regularly. I don&#039;t think one should EVER become too attached to any particular drug. &quot;The Middle Path&quot; of drug use is what I would advocate. Bounce around the drug realm from time to time, never letting any one drug become too regular.<br /><br />Even when I smoked pot every day, I wouldn&#039;t be happy about that. If it&#039;s your passion, then ya go for it, but I just felt like I was wasting a lot of time/money/energy on a rather boring substance(IMO).<br />

				You have to specify what do you mean with &quot;safe&quot;, do you mean long-term damage to your body? Than stay away from smoking, drinking and Steroids in pill form - for keeping your nervous system undamaged don´t take any Dissociatives (esp. PCP), Alcohol and Amphetamines (esp. Fluoroamphetamines).<br />If it´s the addiction potential that you fear, stay away from Crack Cocaine, strong Opioids, Tobacco, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates and Alcohol.<br />Or do you mean psychological damage? Than stay away from all Psychadelics (including Weed), Stimulants, Alcohol, Dissociatives and Delirants.<br /><br />As you can see almost all Drugs/Medications have damaging properties, you have to weigh the pro/cons and then decide for yourself.<br /><br />On a sidenote, Banjo is right - pure heroin is (in theory) completely harmless (besides OD) to your body, it´s the cutting agents, the addiction and the OD potential what makes heroin (and the rest of the Opiate/Opioid family) so dangerous.<br /><br />[e]lol, -karma for this post, looks like i hit a nerve somewhere

				Safe is very relative term indeed. <br /><br />If you consider something safe as long as it is less harmful then tobacco or alcohol, you have a very wide selection of drugs to choose from.

				Pretty much nothing, as mentioned. Anything with daily or semi-daily use will start to effect you over a longer time frame. Even if it just that your body begins to become used to it, your mind gets sick of the effects, you start to increase dosage to still reach the same highs and then the damage builds up quicker.<br /><br />Having tried probably around a dozen different strains of weed in the last year or so though, I would say get 3 or 4 completely different strains and rotate them. Also get 2-3 different bongs and rotate them, because they do make a pretty big difference as well. That will keep things fresh and different for you. Then every month or so you could throw is something a bit different for a night like some lsd or mdma.

				Chewing coca and khat leaves are the best and healthy. If your market sells poppy buy and chomp up some. Great to get stoned after a hectic day at work.

				Weed is the only drug I know of from experience that you can do everyday and still function relatively well and is relatively safe. Alcohol on the daily I would not advise, I&#039;ve seen it ruin many peoples lives. You could do JWH-18 on the daily for a while but probably not that long and its long term health effects are still not known so its probably not &quot;safe&quot; and you do build up a tolerance to the stuff pretty quick. But as people have already said there isn&#039;t really anything you can do regularly that is &quot;safe.&quot;

				I would say tripping once or twice a week doesn&#039;t do any harm, but it definitely diminishes the magical and introspective effects of it. Which if you are eating them a few times a week you are using it more recreational and less for spiritual purposes anyways.<br /><br />I never noticed any negative side effects at least, besides that I felt guilty like I was betraying them (the shrooms) since I wasn&#039;t tripping to better myself, but to just have fun.
