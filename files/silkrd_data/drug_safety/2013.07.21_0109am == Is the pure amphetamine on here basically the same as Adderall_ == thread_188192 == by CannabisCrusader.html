				Does it cause the same effects at roughly the same dose?<br /><br />So would 20mg speed be equal to a 20mg adderall IR?

				No. Adderall is actually a mixture of several substances, which is why the generic name for it is &quot;amphetamine salts&quot;.<br /><br />The efficacy of Adderall is different as well, because the dextroamphetamine it does contain is salted to various compounds. These increase the molecular weight.<br /><br />To put it succinctly, a dose of Adderall is equal to 75% its weight in pure dextroamphetamine.<br /><br />However, buying amphetamine is not necessarily buying enantiomeric dextroamphetamine; you may be buying a racemic mixture of l- and d- amphetamine. In addition, you don&#039;t know if you&#039;re buying the freebase or a salt, or which salt (since the compound affects the molecular weight as well). Finally, you don&#039;t know what kind of impurities are present, and to what degree. So there&#039;s really no way of knowing that you possess 100% dextroamphetamine freebase when you buy &quot;speed&quot;, but assuming you did, 15mg of it would be equal to 20mg of Adderall IR.

				... in layman&#039;s terms: sort of, but not really.&nbsp; I recommend CapeCrusader or BoyMaster.&nbsp; Their stuff is almost as good as pharmaceutical grade amphetamine (adderall).&nbsp; It won&#039;t be milligram-to-milligram though.&nbsp; Try it and get a feel yourself, it&#039;ll vary by batch anyway.
