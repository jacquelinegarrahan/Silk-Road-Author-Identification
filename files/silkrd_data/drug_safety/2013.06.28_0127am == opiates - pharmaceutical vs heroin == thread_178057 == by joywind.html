				Dilaudid is the only pharm worth its salt because its got legs, its strong, and its totally soluble in water. It cooks up perfectly. Oxys are for kids or chippers or hillbillies. Oxys always made me feel like shit anyway and are full of wax.<br /><br />Pharms exist so SWPLs can do narcotics and pretend they&#039;re better than skag addicts. They also exist so shit-proles can get hooked on things you can&#039;t brew up in swamps. <br /><br />This lady I knew who is a hooker would eat percs and oxys like Pac-Man does pellets. I told her she&#039;s retarded for not just using good china white, and she told me I was a junkie scumbag and that&#039;s why I think that way.<br /><br />SWPLs like smoking weed and popping prescription pills, then they can maintain plausible deniability about their drug use (&#039;needles/heroin/meth is bad shit, the govt needs to crack down on that shit&#039;), etc

				I started out snorting the Original Oc&#039;s, then moved on to Injecting Dilly&#039;s . I like H and BTH much better though. I think Oxymorphone is better than Hydromorphone , I do still love Dillys though. <br /><br />When i was on just Pain meds, i didnt look at any drug user diffrent because i was on presciption drugs, If your a addict your a addict no matter how much some one sugar coats it or changes or adds some fancy words to it. Still falls down to the same thing. <br /><br />What were you really intending Op by making this thread&gt;? Just curious about what peoples thoughts were?

They were involved from vietnam war controlling white heroin trade from Asia, to cocaine base introduction, to Afghanistan.
