				I&#039;ve got a little event going on tomorrow, just a few of us.. We&#039;re planning on taking 100ug of Lsd each, topping that up with about 15-20mg 2C-b, whilst smoking a few joints and sipping a few beers. However I&#039;ve also got 175mg of MDMA left so I was thinking I might bomb all that before I take the acid/2c-b so I&#039;m buzzing for the comeup. Obviously I&#039;ll be drinking plenty of water etc.<br /><br />But what I want to know is that, despite whatever bad trips I could have, is this actually physically safe? I&#039;m not too concerned about tripping out, what I want to know is if this is even safe to do, whether there will be adverse chemical reactions etc.<br /><br />Cheers

				There&#039;ll be a lot of stimulation, but I would say that that combination is relatively safe. A few things that I would recommend:<br /><br />1. Test your LSD. If the acid has been substituted, it might be another phenethylamine in which case you may be even more stimulated, and then you might run into overdose territory there.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t mix alcohol with 2C-B. This is just from personal experience, but 2C-B was one of the materials that &quot;TOMSOed,&quot; and so my experience was EXTREMELY intensified with the addition of some alcohol, far beyond what I would have expected or hoped for, and quite some time after I&#039;d thought I was almost done with the trip.<br /><br />3. Separating things further apart is usually safer. I&#039;d also try to make sure none of you are at particular risk for epilepsy, but that might be bordering on paranoid preparations.<br /><br />Have fun and let us know how it goes. =]

				Personally would either eliminate the alcohol or keep it to 2-3 drinks, and remove one psychedelic from this combo. Do u want to remember anything from the night haha?

				This combination is safe assuming you do the following:<br /><br />a couple of &quot;sips&quot; of beer I recommend no more than 2 spaced out alot. You don&#039;t want to get drunk on LSD and MDMA its just not safe and 2c-b and mdma combined alcohol could be serious.<br /><br />Make sure your mdma is in fact mdma and your LSD is in fact LSD. <br /><br />Pre-load the MDMA, taking it with 2c-b and all these other drugs are increasing your chance of neurotoxicity and you will probably have one hell of&nbsp; a hangover if you dont pre-load.<br /><br />Personally I would do that all and just leave out the 2c-b because I don&#039;t trust RC&#039;s especially with multiple drugs. Its just not researched enough to tell how your going to react.<br /><br /><br />Good luck! I wish you the best.

				I would cut out the booze and wait until you are coming up on the L and 2C-B to bomb the molly, coming down on molly while tripping is no fun :(<br /><br />Personally I would cut out the 2C-B as well, but if you&#039;re determined to do this combo go for it and safe travels 8)

				So that was fucking crazy.<br /><br />The md went nicely into the acid/2c-b.. Very advanced visuals, not so much patterns but the detail of things was amazing. Kept having ridiculous trips/mad thoughts and then suddenly waking up again, and then going back into the trips and bright morphing colours, staring at trees, the grass.. And then waking up again. Perspective of shape kept changing constantly. Felt like I was made of metal at one point or had some high voltage electricity running through me. The beers just kinda made it a bit sloppier, no adverse affects. And the weed made shit just fucking heavy, although the 2c-b/mdma took the edge off. Just walking around fields and looking at nature was amazing. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend the combo but maybe leave out the weed. Just did 2c-b again today, if you&#039;ve got stuff bothering you on your mind don&#039;t take a lot. Was still pretty good but had moments of anxiety. Could probably counteract that with a decent bomb of MDMA
