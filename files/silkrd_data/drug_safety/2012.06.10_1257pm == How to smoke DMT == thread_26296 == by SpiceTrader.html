				Personally, I use &quot;the machine&quot; to vapourise it. Really simple to make. Amazing results. <br /><br />http://p7d2k2xiioailnuu.onion/upload/x511zq.jpg <br /><br />Get a tiny glass bottle, put some steel wool in the end and drill a hole in the base. When you want to take the DMT, put it into the hole so it falls into the steel wool while gently warming the wool up with a lighter (placed quite far away). The DMT will melt slightly and merge in the wool. To actually vape it, hold a lighter gently underneath (after taking the bottle cap off) and suck slowly through the hole in the base.

				I&#039;ve heard great things about &quot;The Machine&quot; as rykuaz mentioned. Sounds like it is very difficult to smoke incorrectly once you have made one.<br /><br />Many people, myself included, struggled with small glass crack pipes only to ditch them for another device. <br />Edit: Forgot to add, when using a glass crack pipe type (I usually tried the Ubie) I would need 50-75mg for a jim-jam breakthrough, 75-100mg for full-on hyperspace.<br /><br />I&#039;ve come to love a decent bong/bubbler with 3+ screens in it or with the D caked between herbs/ashes. DMT is already an intense blast-off, getting every last bit in 1-2 hits through a bong is a fantastic experience. No more pre-flight anxiety, no wondering &quot;did I smoke enough,&quot; just light, fill, inhale, blastoff.<br />Edit: Never really weighed my doses through these, just ripped it until I was gone. I tended to overpack and there was usually half a bowl or so remaining for me to enjoy later after the come-down.<br /><br />I recently tried using an Eclipse Vape for the first time. I loaded with 20mg spice and it worked very well. It vaporized quickly, tasted minimally, and didn&#039;t waste any spice from the looks of it. The trip didn&#039;t come on as quick as when I smoke it through bongs/bubblers, but that was expected since the Eclipse has a slower draw. <br /><br />If you have a piece you&#039;ve decided on using, I recommend loading a small dose &lt;20mg (such as I did for the Eclipse Vape) to experiment with how to light it. You don&#039;t want to burn the DMT and usually it takes a nice balance of applying heat and gently inhaling to get it going. Once you know it is vaporizing breathe out and inhale as much as possible.

				Get a GVG (Sherlock model) and Chore Boy copper scrubbers.&nbsp; Soak the the copper scrubber inside IPA or Acetone for a couple of minutes for cleansing, then let it dry thoroughly.&nbsp; Mold the cobber scrubber into the shape of a disc – this will act as a screen.&nbsp; It should be slightly smaller in diameter than the inside diameter of the GVG chamber/bowl, and it should be fairly thin – maybe 3 mm or so.&nbsp; Keep the mesh somewhat loose so that air will flow freely through it.&nbsp; When you&#039;re torching, keep the flame at a reasonable distance so as to not burn/pyrolyze the DMT.&nbsp; Practice makes perfect, but once you get the technique down perfectly, you&#039;ll be vaporizing every mg of the DMT, and you won&#039;t need 60-100 mg for a breakthrough experience.

I just started using it and it is similar to the GVG. I&#039;ve used it by placing the DMT dose directly in the glass vials provided and vaporizing that way. However, it seems that perhaps I should place some copper scrubber in the glass vial, melt DMT into it, and then apply heat to the vial?<br /><br />Eclips Vape has a metal piece for majority of the vaporizer, with a screw-on glass vial for the bowl.

				&#039;The Machine&#039; is the way to go.&nbsp; Use a Hennessey (sp?) bottle.&nbsp; Easy to make and replace.

				Hi guys,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the machine seems like a good idea if you looking for effective use of your DMT on the cheap but I would like to offer the way I used to do it.<br />This idea is not mine originally, rather it is a adaption of the basic idea of a vaporiser.<br />You need a testtube with a side arm (for apply vacuum originally), into this you put a thistle funnel (a long thin glass funnel which has a sort of wide cup at the top) in (through a hole in a bung if you can but it works just as well without). A piece of rubber hosing (type doesn&#039;t matter too much but nothing to porous) is then attached to the sideram and you are ready to go.<br /><br />The beauty of this design is that the test tube bottom is solid (no messing about with screens or fears of loosing the crystals), small and curved so the dmt has nowhere to escape too. The its simply a matter of applying a jetflame lighter and waiting until the vapours almost fill the test tube and then you can whack the whole hit in one shot. Dont go too fast unless you want to try tripping with a throat that is trying to close up because you burnt it with hot smoke! its no fun.<br /><br />I found that this way was great for getting a good strong hit all at once so I could then dump the contraption, sit back and enjoy - its efficient too! except for a light dusting of dmt that crystallises out on the cold glass surfaces of the funnel and sides of the tube you get it all where you want it - crossing your blood/brain barrier and getting to work.<br /><br />The apparatus costs about&nbsp; 10-15 pounds so its not going to break the bank.

				Personally I don&#039;t have access to glass drill or steel wool easily, so I have made a simple but effective &quot;DMT pipe&quot;.<br /><br />I take a cheap wooden pipe that has about 1/2-inch opening on top and put a few of those round pipe filters in it (they&#039;re just a bit larger than 1/2-inch, but flexible, so they stay in the pipe secure). The steel filters provide even heat-up and vaporization of DMT, and wooden pipe provides for easy delivery (DMT doesn&#039;t stick to wood like it does to glass). I then put the right amount of freebase DMT on top of the mesh filters, and gently place flame from the lighter on top, and inhale (carefully, so as not to get any liquid DMT in).<br /><br />It works like a charm - I got huge hits of DMT from that. Zero assembly required and only two pieces - wooden pipe and some mesh filters (any smoke shop sells it, together around $10).

				Would a meth pipe , with a small amount of steel wool in the fishbowl part work? Placing the DMT on the steel wool????
