				So there&#039;s a music thread for things to listen to while tripping, but how about things you should WATCH while on LSD?&nbsp; &nbsp;:P :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been the type to watch a movie, but for me, the best thing is a humongous flat screen TV, loud speakers and Winamp&#039;s Visualizer called MILKDROP running on the TV.&nbsp; That visualizer with the BTLC preset pack you can find on the web is the coolest thing ever.&nbsp; The visualizer moves in perfect sync with the music and shows you some ridiculously amazing things.&nbsp; <br /><br />What else is good to watch on LSD?<br /><br />I&#039;m told Alice in Wonderland?&nbsp; What else??? ;D

				Honestly anything can be amazing but I like animations the most, the really imaginative and visually interesting ones like those from Studio 4Â°C, weird ones like Fantastic Planet, and you can find tons of compilations of interesting/experimental shorts (Lawrence Jordan is one guy I recall). I was once watching compilations of the animations from Monty Python&#039;s Flying Circus on youtube and thought I&#039;d never stop laughing...<br />Then you have things like Baraka, Samsara, and the Qatsi trilogy. Nature documentaries, or documentaries/performances of native music and dance.<br /><br />But yes, anything... Just remember that you can get REALLY involved and it becomes very real, so if you put on Apocalypse Now or anything heavy in any way you might not have a happy time at all. And maybe why I have a preference for non-human material. :)

				Yeah, obviously there will be a bunch of people who will come on here and say &quot;it&#039;s a waste to watch tv while tripping.&quot; While, yes, the best trips are usually in the great outdoors, I find it highly enjoyable to enhance my movies with psychedelics. So, here&#039;s the best things i can recall seeing on my 73&quot;: (Side note: I HIGHLY recommend watching them in 1080p)<br /><br />Baraka, Samsara, and TimeScapes (2012) are all amazing dialogue-less movies that center in nature and human interactivity.&nbsp; <br /><br />I saw Life of Pi in theaters and that was fucking awesome. I have no idea how most of it was made (I find that movies that you can&#039;t comprehend how the filmmaker made are the best).<br /><br />Then there&#039;s Requiem for a Dream which gets depressing in the second half but the first part when they&#039;re selling drugs is editing together so well with the music it blew my mind, <br /><br />Others that were just really great movies to see tripping, but not necessarily as visually striking were: Seven Psychopaths, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, King Kong (2005), and Three Kings (mostly just for the cutting edge camerawork).<br /><br />Torrent all those bitches in bluray and enjoy! A few friends and I have a &quot;torrent&quot; coalition, especially for 1080p rips because they take forever to download. We all have got big external drives and whenever one of us gets a torrent, we all end up getting the torrent. It&#039;s a criminal conspiracy.

				What you watch doesn&#039;t nessessarily have to be visualy stimulating. Try watching &#039;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&#039; on Acid. The random jokes about the movies get your mind thinking in funny ways. Hard to explain, but I laugh my ass off watching &#039;MST3K&#039; while tripping.<br />

				Watch &quot;How to Operate Your Brain&quot; by Timothy Leary, while in a dark room. (It&#039;s available on YouTube.)<br /><br />It contains subliminal messages that only become manifest when one is high on acid.<br /><br />Timothy Leary was an evil, evil man.

				Paprika<br />Enter the Void<br />Dark City<br />Avatar<br />9 (the animated one)<br /><br />I personally also find Medieval age films (swords and spears and shit) to be quite nice since they have a lot of great cinematography <br />That and I&#039;m more mentally calm hearing the clash of swords then a rain of bullets. - extra points if they have magic.

				Ensine said it best, Enter the Void. If you can handle watching someone&#039;s DMT trip, them being shot, and the out of body experience that follows while tripping... you are a champion. If you aren&#039;t up for an extremely dark and colorful mind fuck I always find Discovery HD and HD Theater the best. Sunrise Earth, Africa, etc.

				Sorry for pointing out the obvious here but I am pretty sure that Pixar as a company was formed on the sole principle of providing quality colorful entertainment to people on psychedelic compounds. I get it, they aren&#039;t deep... until you get high enough to appreciate the depth.

				Short but sweet, Elephants on Parade. Pretty sure Dumbo is on LSD when he sees this crap.&nbsp; 8) Turn up your shitty sounsystem,sit back and trip balls. <br />For longer things to watch, I&#039;d suggest Wizard of Oz and Alice and Wonderland. They both might be a little cliche, but there&#039;s a reason for it, lol.

				Persona (1966). <br />2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)<br />Angel&#039;s Egg (1985) By the director of Ghost in the Shell<br />Dreams (1990). A collection of tales based upon the actual dreams of director Akira Kurosawa. <br />Alice (1998). A surrealist re-visioning of Alice in Wonderland. <br /><br />These films are very visual, so I think they would go well with tripping.<br /><br />

				The best thing to watch? Other than the rainbowyness that appears on my normally white ceiling?<br /><br />SNL is fun; even the bad episodes become hilarious and endearing. Staring out the window and enjoying all the prismatic colors of nature is a favorite, too. But I usually end up watching youtube videos of people talking in a google hangout or something, and then realizing that I can&#039;t really follow/understand what they are saying. <br /><br />I picked up the Planet Earth blu-rays to watch during a trip, but I never remember about them... <br /><br />I recently watched The Dark Knight Returns while on 25i, and for at least half of the movie, I was thinking that it was some brilliant parody/deconstruction of the genre. It just seemed so... silly and fake, but still beautiful. I was so impressed with it!...until I remembered about taking the 25i.

				Some great things to do while trippingâ¦can you add to this?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go for a walk or go hike in Natureâ¦Especially if it is raining!!!!&nbsp; Staring at the moon can be an experience in itself.&nbsp; <br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Go to a Concert or Rave <br />5. Painting and Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on a psychedelicâ¦the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; The paint does this disappearing, reappearing act and it is quite fun.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, foot massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You haven&#039;t seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; Download the presets by googling: bltc winamp&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blueberries, Blackberries, Green Beansâ¦Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually donât taste so good.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paint-balling on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.&nbsp; <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other (black-light paint perhaps)<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.&nbsp; <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; Iâm told you can take a bongâ¦pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; Thatâs great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)&nbsp; <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.&nbsp; <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers, legos or clay if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)&nbsp; <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining.&nbsp; <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadgetâ¦)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid.&nbsp; <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself, or Snap a picture here and there.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I canât even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petting a cat or a furry animal. <br />45.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />46.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />47. stream of consciousness writing<br />48.&nbsp; Buy some Gallium online.&nbsp; Gallium is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping.<br />49.&nbsp; Go to a reflexologist or have a masseuse (if you can handle interacting with people while tripping that is)&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know what reflexology is, google it and go do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s mind-blowing. <br />50.&nbsp; Go to a Diner at the end of the Experience and recharge your brain.&nbsp; Reminisce with your tripping partners on your experience (Go Through any pictures you may&#039;ve taken)<br />Any other suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;

That said I feel like its one of those things that&#039;s hit or miss depending on the acid you took, the way you trip was, and how high you are.. I know that if I was peaking driving would have been a big no-no&nbsp; but that brief bit just before total sobriety appears to be good. (Please test this on unoccupied roads before you go out in public, driving while high endangers others as well as yourself)

				Waking Life is an amazing movie to watch while tripping. When watching sober, the way it&#039;s animated already makes it feel like you&#039;re on acid. Add acid and your mind will explode. The ideas that they talk about are extremely interesting too.

				Sounds silly, but I watched that old short movie &#039;Puff the Magic Dragon&#039; for the first time on LSD and cried the entire way through because it spoke such volumes about facing fear to me.<br /><br />Another one I believe I watched was Speed Racer, however the entire couple hours were filled with so much color and intensity I am not actually super sure. I will have to look that up. It was really great but it moved a little fast for me in my state.
