				Deplin (l-methylfolate/levomefolic acid)&nbsp; Doctors are now using this to improve the efficacy of antidepressants (SSRI&#039;s, norepi inhibit) with very impressive results.&nbsp; So far, from my early/brief review of the literature, this molecule could have some benefit in the post-MDMA recovery stage and even more excitingly may enhance the overall experience with a pre-peri-load; even more so than 5-htp (Which I avoid the day of) with it&#039;s notable enhancement of making new neurotransmitters.&nbsp; Particularly the portion of people of people who report the loss of the &quot;magic&quot; very quickly or have the mid-week wall of depression post roll; even if they have a proper intake of folate (most do) they may be the &quot;Approximately 10% of the general population (homozygous TT) lack the enzymes needed to receive any benefit from folic acid.[citation needed] Another 40% of the population (heterozygous CT) appear to convert only a limited amount of folic acid into levomefolic acid. They cannot fully process supplemental folic acid at RDA or higher dose levels.[citation needed] The remaining population do not have a known MTHFR polymorphism and can therefore metabolize folic acid more efficiently.&quot;&nbsp; taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-methylfolate<br /><br />At a minimum I will be taking folate post roll (I don&#039;t think I fall in the group lacking the enzyme--- over ten years of 10-30/year still with all the magic and little recovery), but I will also be testing this with a pre-load, pre-load with day of, and just day of.&nbsp; What makes this more promising is there appears to be no negative side-effects from consuming this molecule (pretty rare).<br />More info <br />http://www.deplin.com/deplin-and-depression/how-deplin-works/<br />Any other biochem nerds like myself, what are your thoughts?
