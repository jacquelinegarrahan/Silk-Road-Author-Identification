				Hi,<br /><br />I would like to start some growing on my own. Now, I have no experience with any kind of plants, so I would like the<br />most forgiving seeds (indoor). I cannot be counted on to check the moisture-level regularly (I either forget, or don&#039;t<br />judge it correctly, I cannot guarantee an exact lightcycle, and generally I am rather chaotic.<br /><br />Is there anything that could survive a farmer like me?<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />Stephe

				AK-48 from Nirvana seeds is a great starting point.<br />Really potent strain, very resistant to newbie grower mistakes, short fat plants with a big yield.<br />Easy to trim as well, has a nice aroma. Only downside is: Taste like asshole. The smoke is thick and harsh but gets the job done VERY well.

				AK-48 is a good suggestion. Look into the M39 strain also. It&#039;s not quality weed, but its yield is very high and it&#039;s nigh impossible to kill by screwing up.

Any Northern Lights cross is a good choice for new growers.

				I might catch flak for this but in light of you stating your light schedule might be chaotic, I&#039;m going to suggest either Iranian autoflower by Dr. Greenthumb or DJ Short&#039;s Blueberry. These two flower regardless of light cycle, have a short grow time, and stay nice and short. Trying to grow normal plants without a set light schedule will get you a bunch of hermed out seedy bud because they need a set amount of darkness during flowering. Autoflowering plants can literally be grown with the lights on 24 hours a day after they root and veg. Because of this you can have a rotating crop growing in a small space and not have to worry about having separate veg and flowering chambers.

				New Guinea Gold (Nuigini Gold)<br />Sativa<br />I am hearing reports of 25+thc for this &#039;wild&#039; strain. Tuff as nails. Cant kill it with weed killer.<br />I was surrounded by it at one stage and never kept one seed

				I know a lot of people that were so clumsy and idiotic they could barely spell their own name or profession grow these strains successfully:<br /><br />Skunk # 1<br />Afghani<br />Northern Lights<br />AK47<br />Critical Mass<br /><br />I personally would go with the Skunk # 1, as well as Nirvana Seeds &quot;Indoor Mix&quot; that would be a excellent choice for a first time grower, both very forgiving/robust and will reward you with some v. nice green
