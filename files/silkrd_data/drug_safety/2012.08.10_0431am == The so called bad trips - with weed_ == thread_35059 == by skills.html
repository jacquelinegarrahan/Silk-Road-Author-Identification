				I&#039;ve done some &quot;heavy&quot; drugs at this point, cocaine, md, lsd, dmt, 2c-b etc.<br /><br />I know lsd very well, and i know what a bad trip with lsd sounds like, can be scary, but i&#039;m talking of a different bad trip.<br /><br />I&#039;m a pot head, a regular smoker and often i smoke mild soft weed, not that powerful and i can smoke all night, get very numb and high, without many thoughts on my head or at least they are inoffensive. <br /><br />The thing is, like 1 in 20 times i smoke (Mostly when i get really good weed) i get a bit mentally fucked up (sad?), i&#039;ll try to be more precise and tell you - with negative thoughts in the head - and once i bounce to that side, it&#039;s quite hard to get back to my good chilling trip.<br /><br />I can get back to my normal high stage, but when this happens, sometimes i can only stop thinking shit when i&#039;m not high anymore...<br /><br /><br />Resuming, i&#039;m not even close of quitting smoking as i enjoy it too much, but, is this normal? Did this happened to anyone else here?

				According to Erowid, cannabis is considered to be a psychedelic. Because of this, I like to keep in mind Tim Leary&#039;s &quot;set and setting&quot; approach when it comes to the usage of marijuana. That is, if there are other things on going on in your life which may cause these negative thoughts to come up, marijuana could possibly cause you to think of them in a manner which cannot be easily controlled.<br /><br />I know of a few smokers who have stopped due to their inability to control their negative thoughts (they say it&#039;s paranoia). I haven&#039;t experienced this yet but then again I am very careful with my usage and I try not to exceed my threshold for getting &quot;too high.&quot; In my opinion smoking more after already being high is a waste.<br /><br />THC is the main contributing factor to the psychedelic effects of marijuana. Try smoking a strong indica?

				When I take a break from smoking(I was an avid smoker for 3 years, pretty much every day) and let my tolerance go down to nothing, I will have these experiences. I feel just extremely uncomfortable, no other way to explain it in my experience. This slowly went away with daily usage and tolerance build-up. But like you said, if I get some stanky danky, this can easily bring the &quot;bad trip&quot; back if I am not used to it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t smoked weed in over a month. I am planning on picking some up soon, this is gonna be fun! :) I wish there were weed forums and stuff in onionland, that were actually populated.. (like cultivation, etc.. ESPECIALLY mushroom cultivation). <br /><br />Anyways, yes they are very common in a lot of different people (everybody I hang out with that smokes sometimes gets this effect). Nothing to worry about. Toke on&nbsp; ;).

At this stage I think- right, time for a rest. When I start again, especially if it is skunk strength, the initial paranoia is too much- that&#039;s when the negative thoughts start- I ride it out, and after nearly an hour, my mind sort of &quot;stabilizes&quot; and I can then continue and enjoy it. I find my mind gets a bit manic with these thoughts at first. I do enjoy my own company, like, not for a few good years, but when I used to go to festivals and stay for 5 days, by the third day, I have to go off on my own, preferably across the countryside and chill by myself, I do prefer to smoke strong weed by myself as it can make me feel socially awkward and a bit paranoid. I guess I am basically shy and weed does tend to intensify those sort of things. <br />Have you tried a vaporizer, I just got one last year and love it- the weed does seem to need to be strong to get the best out of it. The thing I have found is weird, normally I would feel paranoid going into a shop heavily stoned, but when the high is from vaporizing, I feel much more in control, it does not effect me physically- my eyes don&#039;t get the classic &quot;slit eyed droop&quot; or red, because of this, I know the other person cannot see anything to make them think I am stoned- I can be so stoned I can&#039;t even get my words out, they get mixed up, but even then, I don&#039;t get the paranoia. It&#039;s weird, it&#039;s like those effects are caused by some cannabinoids that don&#039;t get vaporized. It has really opened up a new world for me in that respect- I would really recommend you try one if you haven&#039;t already. I would be interested to hear if anybody else has noticed that aspect of vaporizing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I also suffer from paranoia from time to time. I only smoke about 2 times a week. I also discovered the stronger the weed the more paranoia I get, but it also depends on my mindset.<br />I just got a vaporizer last month, but I only tested it once combined with a blunt. I&#039;ll test your thesis about the paranoia. Thanks for your insides.

				while, for me, paranoia from pot was trifling compared to say, meth, or other stims, it&#039;s still very real. there&#039;s a big difference between smoking a joint on the road at night and worrying that every car behind you is the cops, and meth induced delerium (ninjas coming to get me!), it can still make getting high very unpleasant. <br /><br />if you are used to mid grade weed, smoking a lot of very high quality bud could certainly trigger some paranoia and cycles of negative thoughts. a girl i used to date only enjoyed edibles, as the high was slower and &quot;easier to control&quot; (in her words). could be an option for you?

				I really think it&#039;s paranoia, when i would smoke before i would get frequent bad trips or just negative thoughts about everything.

				The only time I&#039;ve ever had a bad experience with cannabis was the first time I smoked all those years ago. It happened to be a very potent strain and I was simply too high. People tend to think the effects of marijuana are static, as in they are the same every time. They forget that it is still possible to get &quot;too high.&quot; I&#039;m sure many of you know this feeling, and it is quite unpleasant. My advice is to remember that you dont have to smoke to excess every time. Try to only take a few hits now and again. Savor the pleasurable feelings Cannabis can produce for you and don&#039;t take it for granted.<br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />Shifty
