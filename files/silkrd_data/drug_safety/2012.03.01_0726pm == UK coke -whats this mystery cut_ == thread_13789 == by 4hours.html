				I&#039;ve seen this sort of gak being sold quite a lot. It&#039;s being marketed as raw for Â£10 a point<br /><br />It looks good, clumpy &amp; has a pearly appearance soft not gritty. Smells right and feels right between the fingers. Not overly numbing.<br /><br />However...when you do it it does pretty much fuck all. And when you wash it in ammonia you get a white-ish oil that sinks to the bottom of the spoon (looks like cum for want of a better description). Smoke it and you get a hefty blood pressure rush, pulse goes through the roof but no euphoria. Burns with a slight sweet smell.<br /><br />Any ideas what this is? on initial inspection its a very good fake. levamisole with a bit of benzocaine in it? But it should be avoided at all costs as it seems like theres fuck all in it and no doubt it&#039;s very bad for and dangerous to smoke.<br /><br />

				My gut feeling tells me it&#039;s not cut with anything, but is actually cocaine processed without potassium permanganate.&nbsp; Cocaine processed without it contains many other inactive alkaloids, like cinnamoylcocaine, which block the effects of cocaine.&nbsp; The coke will still look good, and even test high for purity, but it won&#039;t do jack shit psychoactively, because it hasn&#039;t been refined to remove the inactives.<br /><br />Coke comes from South America, where the coca plant grows natively.&nbsp; Potassium permanganate isn&#039;t manufactured in South America, so it must be imported.&nbsp; Sodium permanganate can also be used, but is not as efficient.<br /><br />The processing of tens of thousands of pounds of raw cocaine paste require tens of thousands of pounds of potassium permanganate... South American producers aren&#039;t likely to hold up tens of millions of dollars worth of product for lack of precursor chemicals.<br /><br />Whoever controls the world supply of potassium permanganate also controls the world supply of cocaine- just do a search for &quot;DEA cocaine potassium permanganate&quot;, and read through some of the DEA&#039;s Microgram Journals and you&#039;ll see what I mean.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a good link to start:<br /><br />h**p://www.justice.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/journal_v6_num34/pg2.html<br /><br />And here&#039;s a good link explaining how cocaine is produced and refined: <br /><br />h**p://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/cocaine.illicit.production.html#4<br /><br />It&#039;s discussion of the chemistry is detailed, and not easy to plow through unless you&#039;ve taken a fair amount it in college, but fascinating none the less.&nbsp; When you piece the clues together, a pretty clear picture begins to emerge.

				I think Phenacetin is used quite a lot because of its appearance.
