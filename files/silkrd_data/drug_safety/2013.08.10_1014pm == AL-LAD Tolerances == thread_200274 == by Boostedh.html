				I know all psychedelics share tolerance buildups.&nbsp; I dosed 450 mics of AL-LAD yesterday, I&#039;ve got around 300 mics of LSD that I was interested in dosing tonight.&nbsp; How much tolerance buildup would have been built up?&nbsp; Have any effects?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, since I tripped AL-LAD last night, just for information purposes, how would the tolerance be if I decided to dose 3.5g-5g Penis Envy mushrooms the day after? <br /><br />Reason I ask, I&#039;ve never tripped AL-LAD before until yesterday.&nbsp; Mostly wanting to educate myself before waisting precious LSD, or even some fungi&#039;s.

				Give it a week buddy. most psycheldelics trigger similar receptors in the brain which induce a psychedelic state; while some phenethylamines are not neuro toxic, some ergoloids may be.<br /><br />a week is always a good starting place. it also means your not wasting the time after your trip, its important to own and learn from your afterglow.

				My AL trip was something I wasn&#039;t expecting off of 450ug.&nbsp; It created visuals instead of distorting them like LSD.&nbsp; Which I loved.&nbsp; I walked around my neighborhood to catch the visuals outside.&nbsp; Was very intense.&nbsp; I do know I&#039;ll be getting more whenever I get my BTC.&nbsp; It was up there with LSD in my opinion.

Not sure if you meant open-eye or not). Whereas on Shrooms, it&#039;s sometimes hard to tell if I have my eyes open or closed as almost everything is just distortions of what I am seeing or was seeing.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try AL-LAD soon for a comparison. Hopefully it creates visuals as you say- perhaps my favorite part of LSD is the glitchy visuals it gives.

				Glad to hear you had a good trip on the AL-LAD. I only tried it once and I took 450ug while all my friends only took 150ug. Big mistake lol. I started to see a creepy looking girl in the floor of the bathroom and I mentioned it to my friends, and one of them told me he had thought this house was haunted before (I was at my friends house) and then I started to see hundreds of this little girl in my vision, and went into a bad trip and started freaking out.<br /><br />Visuals were stronger than any psych (besides DMT) that I&#039;ve done so far. Honestly the visuals were up there with DMT OEV&#039;s I&#039;ve gotten, though.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in the LSZ, almost entirely because the name LSZ sounds bad ass, haha.

				Hahah, very enjoyable thread for me. <br />Please don&#039;t waste precious lysergic acid amides with back to back trips. A few folks have said &quot;I didn&#039;t feel much&quot;, I say &quot;have you tripped recently&quot;, and they reply &quot;yeah yesterday, but it was LSD&quot; <br />Tsk tsk.<br /><br />Honestly, I&#039;ve gotten all kinds of different reports from the AL-LAD. 99% of them are super positive. However, I had a personal friend take 10x 150ug tabs and say that while it was their best trip in recent history, they were surprised at the lack of visuals. <br /><br />The one (somewhat) negative report I do have is from someone eating 1.5 tabs, and basically experiencing ego-loss to the point that communication was impossible for 2 hours. Retreating into solitude, they said the audio hallucinations were so intense that they could not tell what was real and what they were creating in their own mind. Turns out though they worked through some personal issues and were glad they took it, even though they said they will likely not repeat.<br /><br />I personally get some fractally/geometric shapes covering my vision, but the world hasn&#039;t melted on me. <br />Haven&#039;t tried the LSZ yet, but a close friend of mine said he was also not impressed in the visual department, but mentioned a deep underlying and undefinable feeling that was dominant throughout the 2nd half of the trip.<br />&lt;3 EAG

				A week is a good guide to follow for breaks between trips. Note that after doing this for a month or more may require more than just a week.

				Any of you guys post your AL-LAD trip reports yet?<br />Almost all of them on Erowid speak very highly of AL-LAD and show great potential.<br />Might have to pick up a 3 strip to try soon.<br />Though I&#039;m sure it&#039;s still too early to tell, all I can say is thank god it&#039;s not another NBOMe.<br /><br />Vanquish<br /><br />

				Despite eating ten grams of shrooms over the weekend, I decided to take two tabs of AL-LAD today.<br /><br />Holy FUCK is this amazing. It&#039;s everything that candyflipping should have been and more. If you love acid, you&#039;ll love this. I wish I could have an unlimited supply of both.

				I agree with you zvp.&nbsp; The visuals on the AL-LAD are amazing.&nbsp; Although there&#039;s no feeling like real LSD in my opinion.&nbsp; It&#039;ll always be #1.

				Interesting. I have yet to experience real OEV with this drug, but I&#039;ve only tried it at 75 and 150 ug. 150 ug was a pretty strong trip for me, despite having experience with 100+ trips on psychedelics, many of them being ego death or similar intensity. At 150 ug I felt very &#039;drunk&#039;, kind of how one can feel on LSD at times if that makes sense. It was like blowing up on really good quality MDMA, where you just want to lay down on a couch and feel amazing. There were some visuals that I noted on the comeup which were more rainbow-colored than the visuals I&#039;ve noticed while on LSD, but then again visuals are hard to come by for me :(

LSD itself seems to stop giving me very many visuals about 4 or 5 hours in; with AL-LAD, I could close my eyes at any time during the trip and see various tessellated, kaleidoscopic and erotic animations. The open-eye warping was constant as well. I love it!<br /><br />I do agree with you that I still like LSD more, but AL-LAD is certainly a contender- pretty much no other substance I&#039;ve tried has come this close to LSD in terms of its magic.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to post a more detailed trip report when I have time, but for those reading this- if you&#039;re apprehensive about trying AL-LAD, don&#039;t be! If you love acid you&#039;ll certainly love this.

				Hmm, <br />I should probably experience more before commiting to this statement, but I think I enjoy AL-LAD even more than LSD. I have had amazing revelation on LSD, but I&#039;ve been taking it for so long, that it doesn&#039;t seem to blow my mind anymore. I probably need to take more if I want to blow my mind, but the 8 hr trip is somewhat offputing these days. Quality of street LSD also seems to vary quite a bit. For example, even my swiss which I vend here, I describe as slightly shakey during the comeup. The AL is just so damn smooth on my body, 0 jitters from start to finish, beautiful visual/audio changes. Some folks say that it is less awe inspiring, but at 300ug my mouth was hanging open in a constant &quot;whoaaa&quot; for 2 hours.<br /><br />I have also had a chance to try the LSZ, which I also find pretty darn smooth on my body (still not as nice as AL) and very mental, but almost nothing in the visual department, even at 300ug. However, I did find I was better able to visualize in my minds eye if that makes any sense.<br />
