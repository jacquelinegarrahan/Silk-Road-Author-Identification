				I figured I&#039;d post this also as I just posted about the A/B extraction process last night.....LeJunks method is on clearnet forums but I thought it would be great info for people here too as I couldn&#039;t find it after searching &#039;ammonia cook&#039; on SRF.<br /><br />Larging up LeJunk for his priceless information on acetone washing &amp; freebasing, here it is:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ***************************************************************************************<br /><br />The Real Ammonia cook (HCL to freebase)<br />George the blue dog has a bitch friend (daisy) in the next town over,she stumbled on this recipe and asked George to ask the masses if it is valid and probable of a successful out come.<br />George has used the search mechanism on the forum and came up with NO definitive answers..<br /><br />This is a quote from other resources and intended for informational purposes only that exist in a parallel dimension...George the blue dog assumes no responsibility for the information and or actions here on in and here by declares this thread as &quot;read at your own risk&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;&quot;&quot;The correct method for making 100% pure freebase cocaine is to dissolve 1 gram of adulterated cocaine in 40 ml.s of water in either a large glass beaker or glass mason jar. Whatever you decide on, just make sure it&#039;s glass. <br /><br />If any remains undissolved, it&#039;s not cocaine, so we need to get it out of there before wasting any time on that crap. Therefore, if any does remain undissolved, simply filter it into a separate glass container via a standard round coffee filter and plastic funnel. Once all of the liquid has drained thru, add 20 more ml.s of water thru the same filter to gather any cocaine water than may have permeated the filter paper. Our final objective is to have a total of 60 ml.s of water per every one gram of cocaine. In other words, if all of your original cocaine dissolved completely in the original 40 ml.s, then simply add 20 more ml.s of fresh water to that and move on........<br /><br />In a separate beaker or shot glass, have a beaker or shot glass with about 30-40 ml.s of 10% ammonia (Ace Hardware). Your ammonia must be unscented and contain absolutely nothing but ammonia and water. It&#039;s extremely difficult to find, and the only place I could find it was Ace Hardware. I know this because I first looked at Home Depot, Menard&#039;s, Lowe&#039;s, all grocery stores and pharmacies. I&#039;m just saving you the trouble, so go to Ace Hardware. The tall thin white bottle will say &quot;Ammonia 10%&quot;. That&#039;s the one you&#039;ll be needing......<br /><br />Now this next part is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! Using a glass eye dropper, slowly add exactly 1 ml. of the ammonia solution to the dissolved cocaine water. A cloudy bright white precipitate will form with each and every drop. Between each 1 ml. added, stir for 2-3 minutes each time. Now, there&#039;s a HUGE reason for doing it this slowly, so don&#039;t just go and precipitate all of the freebase out in one big shot, okay? With each 1 ml. of the ammonia soln., stir for 2-3 minutes each time, preferably with a glass stir rod. Try extremely hard to not touch any part of the glass container with the stir rod while stirring. You&#039;ll understand why later. After about 4-5 ml.s and 2-3 minutes between each ml. added, an extremely nasty and unpleasant looking goo will start to form on your stir rod. This is not cocaine freebase, but instead one of the easier forming bases like amphetamine etc. Continue slowly adding the 1 ml. of ammonia soln. and keep checking the stir rod after the 3 minute stirring period. The goo will continue to grow on the stir rod as all of the other freebases other than cocaine continue to precipitate out first. After awhile, you&#039;ll finally start seeing the final base, cocaine, start forming on the stir rod as a bleach white, rock hard substance. Once this happens, pour the entire contents of the water/cocaine mixture into another fresh glass beaker or mason jar, because all that is left to form now will be the last and final base, cocaine! In addition, now clean off the goo from the stir rod containing all the other bases, or junk, and make sure it&#039;s clean for the last and final stage of the process. <br /><br />Continue adding the ammonia soln. to the cocaine/water mixture until no more white precipitate forms with the addition of more ammonia soln. Once all of the 100% pure cocaine freebase is completely done precipitating, pour the contents into a filter and let drain thoroughly. One drained, open the filter and pour the freebase into a glass beaker with a small amount (20 ml.s per gram) of plain fresh water in it. Stir completely to completely rinse off all of the ammonia soln. and then once again pour into a filter. Once drained and while still in the filter, pour a little more fresh water over the now pure cocaine freebase to wash away any final traces of ammonia.<br /><br />Remove the filter paper containing the pure cocaine freebase and place the filter paper still containing the freebase inside between a few paper towels, press firmly on the clump portion to absorb any additional moisture and then while still in the filter paper, blow dry until dry to the touch. Carefully open over a ceramic plate and let all of the freebase fall out onto it. Let air dry for as long as it takes to become completely dry (especially if your planning on reconverting it back to 100% pure cocaine hydrochloride). This could be as long as overnight.<br /><br /><br />Make sure you weigh your adulterated coke beforehand, and then once again after the pure freebase dries. Do your calculation to determine the EXACT purity of the crap you were originally sold, call your dealer and tell him to fuck off that it&#039;s only 26%, and then find a new one.<br /><br />Now, either smoke an entirely different freebase than anything you&#039;ve ever smoked before, or turn that sweet ass 100% pure freebase back into your very first batch of 100% pure cocaine hydrochloride. Enjoy!<br /><br />Using the bi-carb method is an absolute ghetto method way of making cocaine/amphetamine/ephedrine/psuedoephedrine freebase mix, nothing more. There should never be heat involved in the making of cocaine freebase.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
