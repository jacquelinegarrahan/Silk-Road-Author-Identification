				So I&#039;ve done some MDMA in the past.<br /><br />1st time I bombed it (amazing), since then I&#039;ve always snorted it (slightly less amazing, but amazing none the less).<br /><br />Since doing a bit of research I can see that bombing was the correct method for full effect.<br /><br />EVERY time, I vomit though, I feel perfectly fine &amp; all of a sudden I&#039;m sick.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t bother me as I vomit with all drugs except cocaine. (I relate to the Steel Panther song lyrics &quot;I like drugs but they don&#039;t like me&quot; lol)<br /><br />This weekend I have 1g &amp; this is going to go between 3 of us, so I&#039;m planning making ten 0.1g bombs &amp; dropping as required.<br /><br />Does this sound like a good use of my gram?<br /><br />Also does anyone have any advice on my method of ingestion?<br /><br />I heard you can just drop it in a little bit of water or OJ &amp; down it &amp; get the same effect? Will this dull it a bit?<br /><br />Thanks for reading &amp; look forward to some advice :)

				Some people are just prone to throwing up. Make sure you eat properly that day the nutrients in your body will help you process the mdma, just stick with the bombing method it is the simplest and most effective method. You will get the same affect from dissolving in water or OJ but it will taste bad. If you want to go into the art of dosage theres a lot of information around explaining how you should start off with a higher dose than your second, such as 150 + 80 as an example the second dose should be 30% of your first but in reality it doesnt work for experienced users. 150 + 100 would be more accurate.<br /><br />Dont dose for a 3rd time, plan it so your only dosing twice, the 3rd time you greatly increase the risk of neurotoxic damage and also find yourself building up a tolerence.

				some folks throw up often, i only puke when i come up too hard and fast. it&#039;s only for a few minutes i feel naseus, so now as soon as i recognize it i go upchuck, its done and i am rollin ;D&nbsp; also your idea about the 10 points is right on. As theupsman pointed out, dont do the 3rd boost, it&#039;s a waste of product and you will only get a speedy effect run the risk of feeling like shit the next day or three. The mdma on SR is often the most pure you will ever do or see and i have been experimenting and many of the vendors have product that can be capped at .08 and people regardless of weight LOVE it. It is so sad to see people on the lot and at events eating point after point of who knows what, literally 8 caps to = 1 SR cap, sad, to me mdma is about opening hearts, which in turn opens minds. Sure you have a good time, totally escape,dance and love your friends and the moment, and there is where the magic happens. Love and Light

				So vomiting on the come up is pretty common as others have pointed out. As you take the stuff more and more you&#039;ll start to be able to mitigate the nauseous feeling in my experience. For instance, when it just starts to hit me a little hard I start to heat up a bit and if I simply turn on a fan and blow some cool air on me at that point the feeling passes in just a few minutes.<br /><br />The good news with puking on MDMA is that the moment after you purge the world is just a whole lot better. It&#039;s like some invisible barrier that your body passes through on it&#039;s way to getting really high. <br /><br />Since you asked if there was anyway to avoid it, plugging (i.e. liquid dilution of MDMA applied in the butt) seems to cut down the nauseous feeling for a lot of people. Wouldn&#039;t recommend it with a bunch of casual friends but me and my wife do it all the time and enjoy it a little more that way.<br /><br />Otherwise keep a fan handy and a little puke bucket nearby while appreciating that it&#039;s just a quick passing phase.

				Take 1-2 ginger root capsules beforehand, really helps to mitigate the stomach issues. I find it better than OTC anti-nausea meds. 5-HT3 antagonists are the best for serotonin induced nausea but only really available with a prescription.

				Be careful with your dosages... one gram of good molly should easily get 5 heavy people rolling hard. Maybe set aside a quarter of your gram for a couple weeks, that should get you and a friend off for a nice night, and that .75 should still be PLENTY for three people.
