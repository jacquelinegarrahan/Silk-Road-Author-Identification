				Hey,<br /><br />So last night I was with a mate and a bunch of his friends, they were all smoking weed, just having a good time generally. One of them passes me a joint, supposedly rolled with tobacco. I light it up, have a few puffs and cough a bit. It was pretty harsh. I didn&#039;t think much of it at the time, thought that maybe it was just because I still had a bit of a cold and that was making me cough..<br /><br />Well not long after that, the lines on the walls are coming out and moving. I know instantly what&#039;s happening. I close my eyes, and yep, I&#039;m tripping alright. I go up to the guy who passed me the joint and ask him what he gave me. He tried convincing me that it was just tobacco, and then weed. I knew I was tripping and I knew it wasn&#039;t just weed/tobacco that I was given.<br /><br />Peoples faces were changing and morphing in the corners of my eyes, things were moving around, coming into vision, closed eye visuals were pretty strong. I was actually getting pretty paranoid, my heart was racing, I started to freak out a little because I didn&#039;t know what I was on, I started to think people were out to get me. I wasn&#039;t sure if it was because they were talking and I was taking things the wrong way, or because I was just plain hearing things that weren&#039;t there. There was definitely some auditory hallucinations. I remember talking at one point, and towards the end of my sentence my voice sounded weird and high pitched, kind of like a childs voice, and one of the guys (supposedly) said &quot;He sounds weird..&quot; I don&#039;t think he actually said it though, because I didn&#039;t see him talk, and at this point I was pretty well fucked.<br /><br />It was impossible to enjoy any of it because I didn&#039;t know what I was given and they didn&#039;t say anything and tried to say it was nothing. All they had to do was say, &quot;----, do you want to try some ---?&quot; and that would have been fine. I really feel for those people out there who get drugged without knowing. It&#039;s the worst feeling, especially when you don&#039;t know what it was. <br /><br />I enjoy psychedelics, they are my favourite type of drug and I&#039;m always up for trying new things, and would have been more than willing to try whatever it was, had they asked first.<br /><br />Can anyone list stuff that can be smoked that is hallucinogenic? It last probably 4-6 hours. Was harsh as fuck when smoked, and gave the above effects.

				PCP doesn&#039;t cause morphing just as much as things don&#039;t morph when you&#039;re sober. It&#039;s like saying heroin or coke causes morphing, they just don&#039;t.

And you know sometimes, you just have that off the wall experience that doesn&#039;t match the drug at all. It happens.

				I was originally thinking maybe I had a low dose of DMT, but the come up was way too long, and it lasted a lot longer so I kind of ruled that out.<br /><br />I tried thinking of other stuff they could have given me. I would find it hard to believe that they could get a hold of PCP regardless of what effects it produces so I&#039;ll have to rule that one out, at least for now.<br /><br />That night I&#039;d talked to a few of the guys there, some of which said they tried meth, mushrooms etc. At first I thought maybe the anti-depressants I&#039;m taking were doing their thing (I get slight visuals on them? Not sure if it&#039;s placebo or not, but I have definitely had a few times where I&#039;ve closed my eyes and had CEV), and maybe they&#039;d given me meth or something, which, looking back, was just because I was freaking out a bit.<br /><br />Next time I see my mate I&#039;ll ask and see if he&#039;ll tell me, although if he knew, I don&#039;t see why he wouldn&#039;t have told me when I asked last night. <br /><br />I went through so many things in my mind of what it could be, but they all got ruled out pretty fast due to the fact that heat is involved...LSD, mushrooms, etc.

				Possibly Changa (DMT + MAOI infused herb and or weed). Was it really intense for the first 20-30, maybe 45 minutes with a gradual taper of the intense aspects?<br /><br />If you are prepared/willing to take change the effects are usually gone within an hour or so. However, in an unsuspecting individual (especially in combination with weed), the resulting anxiety and residual effects might feel subjectively longer. That is, after the changa wears off you are understandably feeling freaked and violated, which may seem like tripping. Because the duration of your experience coincides with weed&#039;s duration of effects.<br /><br />I&#039;m going with Changa. Are you on an anti-depressant medication? If so that makes Changa even more likely to be the culprit and may better explain the extended duration. <br /><br />&nbsp;I can&#039;t think of any other reasonable culprit. As i understand it, PCP tends to be rare outside of african-american communities and it probably would have lasted longer and you might have ended up naked and bare-knuckle boxing the cops in a McDonald&#039;s parking lot.<br /><br />NBOME can be vaporized but again, unlikely to be laced in a joint for a number of logistical reasons.<br />

I&#039;m taking mirtazapine at the moment.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say exactly what effects I felt. The main reason I thought dmt was because the CEV were familiar with past experiences and I *think* I felt the sort of bitter, burnt taste on my lips. There were tracers from everything, hands heads bodies, etc<br /><br />I was high even before the joint, and that was just because we were in a small room. (I don&#039;t smoke weed so my tolerance would be low)<br /><br />The way faces were changing reminded me of changa, but the times didn&#039;t match up. It got pretty intense as time went on from walls moving to tiles on the wall moving into my vision, peoples faces changing, one in particular changed into an echidna.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done a whole lot of different psychedelics so don&#039;t know how similar they are.<br /><br />synthetic cannabinoids could be possible, but with the amount of weed they had there I don&#039;t think they would need it hah.<br /><br />Thanks for all the ideas guys, really appreciate it.

				25i-nbome in freebase form (and I&#039;m assuming other nbome&#039;s) is smokable, however you would have had a HORRIBLE taste in your mouth after your hit. What you described sounds like an experience I had with ~10mg of 25i; smoked, however much less intense. Tracers, auditory hallucinations, trip length, everything sounds similar to my trip.

It was a strong smoke though, it could just be because there was no filter, water (bong) etc which made it more harsh. It was only the second time I&#039;ve smoke a joint.<br /><br />At one stage I thought I felt that sort of bitter/chemical/burn feeling on my lips/tongue that you get from DMT. If you&#039;ve had DMT you will more than likely know what I&#039;m talking about.

It&#039;s just the fact that, the only things available locally are weed, pills and meth (apparently very shit meth). But here I am on SR, so anything is possible.<br /><br />I asked one of the guys from that night and he said the same thing &quot;I thought it was just weed&quot;, but I don&#039;t see how it could have been, and I think he was lying.<br /><br />Here are a few reasons why:<br />1 - At one point, they turned off the lights, sitting in a big circle, with tool playing in the background. What other reason would there be for that? (see below for why I think this)<br />2 - One guy came over later on and decided to &quot;catch up&quot; to the rest of us (why is that?) and I heard him saying something about how long it stays (active) in the air for.<br />3 - There was a point where they were saying something about how &quot;now is the time to do this *waving hands around looking at them*&quot;. This is when I was getting major tracers.<br />4 - They kept referring to the term &quot;seeding&quot; (I think that was it, or seedy, but the first makes more sense). The context it was used it made me think it was relating to the different stages you reach during the trip.<br />5 - One of them was talking to another about who else they thought would be &quot;fun&quot;. Presumably tricking them into smoking a cigarette/joint/bong and then adding whatever else it was.<br /><br />It&#039;s so annoying not knowing what it was. It&#039;s even worse because I really enjoy psychedelics but in a scenario like that, trying to keep your mind from wandering to bad thoughts proves pretty hard.<br /><br />
