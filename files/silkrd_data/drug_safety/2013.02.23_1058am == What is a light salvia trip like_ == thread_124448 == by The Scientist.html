				I have only ever taken it in light dosages and it was been very unpleasant.<br />I don&#039;t recommend salvia! It&#039;s only ever made me fill dizzy ill and confused. I can get that feeling from a liter of whiskey.<br /><br />If you looking to get into tripping I would start off with a light dose of shrooms you will have a much much better experience all round.<br /><br />But maybe Audio is right and it&#039;s only enjoyable in larger doses, I don&#039;t know.

				Like yokes said it&#039;s really unpleasant, but that&#039;s how i&#039;ve done it.<br />Put around 0.05-0.1 into bowl burn it in 1 toke and hold it for like 10-20 sec (optional i think) you world will start to spin it&#039;s not cuz of lack of oxigen it&#039;s the effect. I&#039;ve been sitting in chair and i have fallen with the chain somewhere into dark. I&#039;ve seen a person in dark meditating but wasn&#039;t able to see his face. I&#039;ve been traveling by ship on various islands and i&#039;ve been piece of tetris lol, every move i did had some colour, it&#039;s real trip you will be totally out of your body, but not on small dosage :).<br />It isn&#039;t marked as strongest haluciogen for fun!<br /><br />Also sorry for my poor english.

				if you smoke leaves it will be weird, uncomfortable, and brief.&nbsp; not much other than that.&nbsp; if you chew/suck on about 5 grams of leaves, you will have a very bizarre and somewhat more comfortable trip for a couple hours.&nbsp; its very interesting.<br /><br />and of course, if you smoke high potency extract your mind will dematerialize and unbelievable shit will happen.

				Does anybody know will smoking some hash before taking salvia make trip more pleasant? Is it safe combining them at all?

				I&#039;ve very much enjoyed my experiences with salvia.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done it both sober and while baked (on hash and weed, for yelloymattercustard) , didn&#039;t seem to affect it too much. Being high may have lessened some of the discomfort, but that was really minimal.<br /><br />Taking lighter hits would feel like a partial/broken trip from a stronger hit. It feels a lot like a &quot;force&quot; represented by a buzzing that takes over your body, a lighter hit might only affect your legs, or distort some sensations but not make you completely trip out.<br /><br />On a strong hit, I just completely dissociate, laughing for several minutes, and return with vague memories of the trip itself (clarity of memory has been getting better)<br />On a lesser hit, I got some interesting bodily sensations and some giggling, and the impulse as if someone else were controlling me to walk a rectangular path.<br /><br />Overall, my experience has been good. Some of the other people who hit it with me didn&#039;t enjoy it though, so I&#039;d say its pretty person-dependent.

				I have no idea...<br />I tried it a few times, but always when I was stoned and drunk (never sober - don&#039;t know why) <br />and every time the only thing I felt was: vomitting...<br /><br />Now I learned that you shouldn&#039;t use it together with alcohol, <br />but back then I didn&#039;t have that knowledge...

				When I had a light salvia high, I pretty much just felt like a smoked a bowl or so. It&#039;s slightly more drunky feely though.

				I&#039;ll expand on my earlier post:<br /><br />My means of ingestion was a waterfall bong (in my opinion, ideal, since it lets you concentrate a bowl into a single lungful) The taste was unique, kinda of a sizzling electronics-sourness.<br /><br />My first trip was 60x, and I hardly remembered anything from it. I came out of it a little emotionally and physically fatigued / feeling sweaty, but tried it again a few hours later and had a great time, remembering more of it that time. It was a fully dissociative trip, as in, people couldn&#039;t get a reaction from me and i have no idea what was going on at the time.<br /><br />20x gave me some interesting trips, where I feel compelled to move but remember the experience, it felt like being a puppet that was being walked around - i could tell as it &quot;took away&quot; control of parts of my body and just started moving them, but it felt like it took no effort - like an exoskeleton was moving me, it would have taken more effort not to move.<br />&nbsp;that was probably more &quot;fun&quot; but left me feeling less spiritually awed. (The 60x trips were very profound / the second one left me a nice afterglow)<br /><br />Lower still doses would make me giggle a bit, or weird out in a limb or 2, but it felt like a bigger high that was failing to start, instead of a smoother, lower level of effects.<br /><br />However, some people who took similar hits just wound up weirded out, the full-dissociative trip might have been too much&nbsp; (I had experience with psychedelics and figured starting on a 60x was worth the adventure)<br />I personally always enjoy psychedelic experiences very much, I embrace them, which may be why I take to salvia so happily.<br /><br />I&#039;d say salvia can be fun at lower-than-hyperspace doses, but the best part of the trip still requires you to be willing to give up a fair amount of control and have a good environment for it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read that dosage may be cumulative over shorts amount of time, and also that chewing it orally yields a nice high. Can anyone comment?
