				I&#039;m in a bit of dilemma and want your, yes YOUR opinion! ;p<br /><br />I&#039;ve currently got a stockpile of MDMA, so need to purchase more anytime soon. However, I&#039;m completely out of LSD and miss Lucy dearly.<br /><br />But perhaps I want to try something new. So I&#039;m wondering, if I had to pick one, should I-<br />Try Mescaline?<br />Try Psilocybin/Shrooms?<br />Try Ketamine?<br />Try something else?<br />Or just stick with the tried, true, and amazing acid? Getting it from Tessellated of course, the current best acid seller on the Road ;-)<br /><br />Thanks for your input!

				If you never tried DMT before then you should. I think everybody should try DMT at last once in their life (naturally on a breakthrough dose).

A few weeks later, I worked up the courage to try again but again could not hold in the smoke long enough- and once more felt a sense of impending doom.<br /><br />I&#039;d really prefer to stay away from it, at least until I&#039;m in a more comfortable stage in my life and perhaps can smoke it as changa.

				Give ketamine a go. It&#039;ll blow your mind, in a totally different way to the acid you&#039;re experienced with.<br /><br />Also you get a lot of bang for your buck. A gram goes a long way if you haven&#039;t built up a tolerance to it (which happens quite quickly).<br /><br />EDIT: also, a line of ketamine is great when you&#039;re on MDMA, which you say you have a lot of...

The first- I&#039;ve heard that the dissociative is either hit or miss for users, and that some people become incredibly terrified at the experience yet can&#039;t do anything about it as they don&#039;t feel inside their body.<br /><br />The second is that I&#039;ve heard right after you come off of Ketamine, you&#039;ll immediately want to dose more. Now, I&#039;ve been able to resist taking additional MDMA at times when I&#039;ve have 9 other Molly capsules lying right next to me, but I&#039;m afraid that if the Ketamine is more powerful than that that I&#039;ll become addicted. How strong is it, how long is withdrawal and how much does it suck?

				It&#039;s one that can become an everyday part of your life, because once your tolerance is up, it&#039;s surprisingly easy to take it in large quantities and still function - to a degree. It was an everyday part of my life for about 6 months when I was in my early 20&#039;s, then one day, whilst high on it, I had a particularly introspective experience during which I decided to give it up. So I did, as easy as that.<br /><br />Ever since then my ketamine use has been rare, and each time I have used it it&#039;s been a cathartic, and ultimately life-affirming experience.<br /><br />Except this one time in a squat party in a disused warehouse, when my wife and I took it together and both agreed we felt like giants amongst all the other people there who were like little munchkin people, about 4 feet tall. That was an MDMA+ketamine one though. I think actually they were all quite small though.<br /><br />Give it a go. It&#039;s a hell of a ride.

				About how many lower-dose experiences do you recommend before attempting to hit the k-hole?

				I probably did it 20 or 30 times at low dose before taking a large enough amount to become completely disconnected. What I like most about it is that when you&#039;re experienced with it you can control and direct things.<br /><br />A friend of mine wanted to go for the full experience on his first try. So I dosed him up properly and sat by him to make sure he was fine. He was fine, and afterwards described feeling like his body shattered like glass, leaving him free to explore the fantasy world he found himself in which reminded him of the film Willow.<br /><br />So I&#039;d say it&#039;s all good either way.

				I feel safest sticking to shrooms, acid, and mdma but if you want to experiment further i&#039;d probably go with the ketamine.

				Shrooms or ket. Maybe something a little more exotic like a 2C? :)

				I would go for 2c-b, myself, if you&#039;ve never tried it. Visually at least it&#039;s a lot like acid (for me CEVs were actually more detailed and intense),&nbsp; and it has an mdma-like body high that goes really well with mdma.
