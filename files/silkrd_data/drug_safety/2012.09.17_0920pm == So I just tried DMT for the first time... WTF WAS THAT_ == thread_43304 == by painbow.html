				So, I took a big puff of DMT and just blacked out.&nbsp; I remember seeing symmetrical patterns as I passed out.<br /><br />I remember just little bits of colorful scenery and BAM I&#039;m back to consciousness.<br /><br />I literally don&#039;t remember a thing.&nbsp; I felt like I was passed out forever but I&#039;m not sure what the value of this drug is.<br /><br />I heard about people seeing life-like forms, alien spiritual guides and shit.. but I didn&#039;t experience any of that.<br /><br />I just blacked out and woke up with visuals that went away after 10 minutes.<br /><br />Did I get a bad batch or does this experience get better over time?

				i know exactly what you&#039;re talking about. it happened to me once when i tried to smoke DMT in the morning. i smoked about 50mg about an hour after waking. when i came to from the blackout, i first thought perhaps i had held the plume of smoke too long and the lack of oxygen had caused me to pass out. but i always hold my breath after taking a hit of DMT so it seemed fine. perhaps it depends on your blood oxygen level; maybe it is ideal to hyperventilate immediately prior to taking a hit. perhaps my blood oxygen level was low due to the time of day. perhaps it has something to do with the varied concentration of brain alkaloids like serotonin and melatonin in the morning as opposed to night. the best DMT trips i have had have always been at night. i don&#039;t think your DMT was likely contaminated with other tryptamines as most of them have considerably longer durations and would probably alter the consistency of the product. can i ask what the texture and composition of the product was like?<br /><br />sawyer

				I have smoked this batch with 5 other people and none of them had break-throughs.&nbsp; We used an oil burner pipe (crack pipe).&nbsp; We made sure to inhale as much as possible.<br /><br />They all had mild hallucinations but none of them have full experience of DMT as described by other people.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the guys was an experienced DMT user and he said this DMT was not good.&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda disappointed, this was my first DMT experience and may have ended up with a bad batch.<br /><br />I got it from BuddhaNature and he seems like a real legit vendor but perhaps I just had a bad batch?<br /><br />

				whew! i broke through about two weeks ago. i had a similar blackout(?) in that i completely separated from everyday consciousness and woke up instantly in an unfamiliar world. it is impossible to describe it adequately. it was like simultaneously being a part of and observing an intricate, continuously evolving geometric &quot;space&quot;. i thought i had died for a good while! i wasn&#039;t aware of my breathing or my body until later in the trip. id like to go back (still have ~200mg left), but am still pretty freaked out by what i saw. that being said, i didn&#039;t go into it on a whim; i&#039;ve wanted to try dmt for quite some time now. it still knocked me on my ass. no matter how much research i&#039;ve done over the past couple years, nothing prepared me for a full immersion ;)<br /><br />not trying to hijack this thread, but would any of you who have blasted off recommend this to someone? i almost feel like now i would have to wait for someone to ask me or express interest first.<br /><br />much love.<br /><br />p.s. if listening to music, <br /><br />behind closed eyelids by shpongle

I wouldn&#039;t even recommend doing 30mg at first. Seriously, depending on how much you have got at your disposal, get acquainted with the substance first on smaller 10-20mg doses. Even at about 20mg, if you vape it efficiently enough, that can send you right into orbit.<br /><br />One of the lessons of DMT, is that your own thinking dictates your trip. Think good, and your trip will be ecstatic, think bad and be prepared for a fucking rough ride. As simple a philosophy as this may sound, being able to remain stable when psychedelic chaos is ripping up all around you is quite another matter and is something that requires practice and experience.<br /><br />On the otherhand, if you do just want to dive right in to a hefty dose then doing so whilst on MDMA, is highly recommended.

				ya want 40 ....its 40 youre lookin for...and you must have a friend there to take away the hot stuff. you cant do it alone and have any fun until youve tripped a coupla times with a babysitter.. you should not be blacking out, thats way too much, and its wasted.&nbsp; start with 30 or&nbsp; 40 if u can and have a sitter there to caretake. you cant be responsible for the hot burny things when you get that good dose, you just cant.&nbsp; someone needs to intervene when you &#039;go&#039;&nbsp; and let you trip peacefully without hurting yourself.&nbsp; after 2 or 3 visits to the keebler elf tree, youll be able to load ur pipe with around 25 or 30, set up your right atmosphere, and B L A S T O F F to the hyperverse all by your little old self..and everything will b beautiful....see u on the other side!

				My 2 cents:<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked DMT 100+ times over the last 8 years. And I have had TWO experiences that I would consider total seperation from body breakthroughs. So don&#039;t be discouraged if you pick up a pipe, take a hit, and feel you have been lied to or something. Also, be prepared for the full range of possibilities. I&#039;ve had my handful of total blackouts, but yeah..more like a dream you can&#039;t recall. I&#039;ve also taken big hits and just not responded, baseline still. Its somewhat of a roll of the dice. Lastly, I think the advice about smoking in excess of 50mg is good advice. I always assumed I was being somewhat inefficient when vaporizing, and figured I&#039;d just put the pipe down with some left in it once I get where I want to be.

				thats a HUGE waste of beautiful lovely. dont waste ur shit, its not like u wont experience anything at 20 or 25. those doses can be ever so magical, everything flowing and GORGEOUS beyond description. get to know ur old pal first, (your brain produces and uses dmt everyday to produce your &#039;reality&#039;) , walk the dog before you take it home...settle in for STUPERNAUGHT l8r&nbsp; when you and the spirit are cuddlebuddies, if you fuck with him before you know him he might sling you around, then youll think hes harsh....and it doesnt have to be that way. relax, chill and lift off...its always around you but you seldom get to peek inside....dont burn your shit up, hold the fire on it enough to get smoke and rest that shit. h o l d for a minute, n do it again....let the man show you around! s p a r k l e y g e o m e t r i c h y p e r d d o m e.....lucy n tha sky with diamonds indeed! ;D

				Sounds exactly like my first DMT experience, 50mg in a bong ripped in one hit. All I could see was this beautiful giant symmetrical circular shaped rainbow thing (how the fuck do I describe it?) and then fell back and woke up 10 minutes later (was playing a song so I could tell how long it had been).<br /><br />Will be loading 50mg into a bong this weekend and taking it in smaller tokes instead. Hopefully is a bit more productive.

				ive smoked dmt 50 + times....ppl always talk about breaking thru...like t mckenna....ive personally never had dmt trips that followed any kind of order....i dont see the chrysalis stained glass thingy and then hear crackling cellophane and burst thru into hyperspace...NEVER ONCE....ALWAYS its like this for me...i take 3 ginormous hits, holding my smoke as long as possible each time....i am immediately in the keebler elf tree...its like im in a peep show where theres glass panes in front of me and &#039;others&#039; looking into a central flowing geometric colored glass candyland with bardo beings doing stuff with the stuff everything is made of....i can see &#039;others&#039; looking in across the way and even next to me but we are never in there interacting with the candyland stuff... the beings know immediately that i am looking...they keep getting my attention, which wants to be overwhelmed with the beautiful flowing river of geometrical shiny colored candy, and making me pay attention to the fact that they are made out of the candy, and they are manipulating the candy and doing stuff with it...what?....idk.....i watch and look at the &#039;others&#039; behind their glass panes and they see me looking... but the bardo beings are ever busy doing...they smile and beckon me to either pay attention or speak or come forth.....idk....but they look exactly like the art work called &#039;bardo being&#039; by alex grey i think his name is. in fact i had never seen that artwork before i tripped..and i was trying to draw these beings i kept seeing in there but i could only get a rudimentary shape of it on paper...nothing like it actually was...more of a stick representation...and then i got turned on to alex&#039;s work...and i saw bardo being and it stopped me cold...chills up and down my spine...because that was the creature i saw repeatedly in there....it was heartstoppingly uncanny that it looked exactly like the creature....but since then the creatures have changed into reptilion beings that dont feel so nice to me....after repeatedly seeing the reptillion thingies...i quit looking...now im back to shrooming and dxm for trippin.... but i miss dmt and might get a coupla grams for another trip into magiccandyland.....i always forgot to listen to music when i blasted off and i feel i missed an important aspect of the trip by so doing..so i wanna do it just for that if nothing else...and its been two or three years now so i hope the reptiles are gone and the candyman or woman is back!!!!! 8)
