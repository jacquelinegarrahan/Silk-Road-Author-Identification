				I got and took a single blue $ pokeball around June last year and had a roll that was like nothing I had ever experienced before. Definitely the best experience Ive ever had on a pill. But it was so very different too. Just incredible amounts of energy, seemed to last for 8 hours, didn&#039;t sleep for a couple days, and my eyes were still dilated a bit 24 hours later. So the question I have is, what was in it? I haven&#039;t been able to find anything about it.<br /><br />If it helps, it looked the exact same as this, except blue: http://www.pillreports.com/images/fullsize/26063.jpg
