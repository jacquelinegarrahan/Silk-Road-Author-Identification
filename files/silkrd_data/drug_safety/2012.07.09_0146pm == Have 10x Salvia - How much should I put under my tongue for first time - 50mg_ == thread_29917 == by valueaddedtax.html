				Smoke it with a torch lighter, the salvinorin A activates at very high temperatures and a normal lighter wastes a lot of the compound by not properly decarboxylating it and inhaling the vapor.

				I don&#039;t like the idea of inhaling smoke. I already did enough damage to my lungs after smoking for years and I&#039;m just off them again, luckily. <br /><br />Thanks.

				I can appreciate that but attempting sublingual or eating will result in you having wasted your money. When the shamans used it to meditate they took a ball of fresh leaf and kept it in their mouth like a cow. It takes a very long time to kick it and it is very mellow but at least it lasts awhile. Using a bit of dried extract under you tongue is a waste.<br /><br />Also, not like you will pick up smoking Salvia, I&#039;m the only one I know who actually enjoys the perspective. For me it is like a lucid dream except instead of becoming lucid and it being great you have to learn to appreciate going from conscious to lucid dream to the immense fear of going deeper and losing your consciousness.

				10x Salvia, chewed/under tongue and kept in mouth for 30min does absolutely nothing and is a waste. And is VERY disgusting. Please don&#039;t do it to yourself. <br />Smoke it under a flame and BAM, the world becomes 2D! lol
