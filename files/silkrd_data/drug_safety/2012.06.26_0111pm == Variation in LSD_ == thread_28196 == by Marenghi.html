With 120 ug blotters i have to take 3 or more to have a decent LSD high. I have done some of dalailamas from juerguens the last week (rated at 300) and a friend of mine who take LSD just one time a year enjoyed it a lot with one blotter. My dosage? 3 of those motherfuckers so 900 ug, it was the best LSD trip of my life. I have done some (x2) NeuroticNarcotic anonymous blotters a couple of month ago and it was really enjoyable too (rated at 350 i think)

				There aren&#039;t different types of LSD (LSD-25 is the only) but as Shannon said there can be varying degrees of quality depending on the crystal it was laid with.<br /><br />I hate seeing that wrong terminology, then having people irl say shit like &quot;I won&#039;t do acid if its not Shiva, Shiva is the only good acid&quot; and shit like that.

				What varies is the types of crystals your blotter is laid with, like so;<br /><br />Needlepoint -very pure(95%) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. The best of the best<br /><br />White Fluff -Very pure(95%) white light flakes of crystal. Still around and the most sought after. very pure<br /><br />Silver -Good and clean(85-90%)-light greyish crystal. Was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. Very good stuff. My first thumbprint was this kind. If you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver.<br /><br />Amber -Decent(70%?) This crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.Was always available.One batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.Lot`s a people worked with this crystal but I always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price.<br /><br />Lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. Like amber it varied batch to batch.<br /><br />TJ (tornado juice) - purity unknown. I seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. No experiance with it.<br /><br />Champagne -(50-60%) black crystal, nasty stuff IMHO. I worked with it once and swore to never touch it again.<br /><br /><br />
