				So far I tried only clonazepam. Its half-life is a bit long and makes me drowsy in the morning, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s better than a short half-life one.<br /><br />I heard there is one benzo which makes you feel like &quot;the man&quot;, which is that?<br /><br />thanks in advance

				Everyone&#039;s preference with benzos are going to be different. My personal favorite is valium. Klonopin comes on slower than xanax. bars hit u like a ton of bricks and if ur not dosing properly you will either pass out, or just black out completly and have no clue what you did. you will do dumb shit. I&#039;ve done ativan,klonopin,xanax,valium and maybe one other i can&#039;t remember and all at abusive dosages. xanax i&#039;ve hit 5mgs on top of plenty of beer (can you say near death experience/blackout city.)<br /><br />your gonna have to try a couple to grasp what your favorite is. it will differ from others.

				No. If you want a euphoric feeling or feel like &quot;a boss&quot; its not preference its xanax.<br /><br />Those other benzos may clear you anxiety and make you feel confident, I agree...But if you want a high go with xanax..<br /><br />It is preference but if we were to take a poll i bet xanax would be 85 percent of the peoples best euphoric benzo...<br /><br />Recently I tried valium didnt like it...Kpins are better but dont get you high! XANAX!

				i agree most people will say xanax is thier favorite, but they all get you high when taken in the right dosages. <br /><br />xanax is the hardest hitting, but it wont make you feel like a &quot;boss&quot; you just wont give a fuck about anything.

				I would say the best benzo inebriation I have experienced would definitely be nitrazepam. Seems like the most intoxicating and provided a feeling of euphoria I didnt achieve from val, xan, or kpin, all of which i enjoy on a fairly equal level.&nbsp; Most people have never tried it I believe since it is more rare now, but if you ever find it dont pass up the opportunity. I would say it has one of the highest recreational values and it lasts for a long time. <br /><br />Flunitrazepam really is too sedating and memory inhibiting to be of any real recreational use in most peoples opinion

				I am in the states too, just got lucky I guess and it may have been imported. It is a schedule IV here though I am not sure if it is regularly prescribed since people abused it so frequently. Theres lots of info on nitrazepam on wiki actually:<br /><br />&quot;Nitrazepam in drug abusers produces effects including feeling energetic, relaxed, drunken, talkative, pleasure and euphoria&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A study found that nitrazepam caused significant euphoria as against placebos and was identified as an active drug by freshly detoxified experienced drug abusers of heroin and other drugs. Nitrazepam resembled diazepam (Valium), however, on certain parameters the effects produced by nitrazepam were more pronounced in these drug abusers.&quot;<br /><br />Its a great time! I believe I have seen it listed before, I am sure someone can find it.

				Here&#039;s my 2 cents:<br /><br />Xanax (alprazolam) - Hits the hardest and the quickest, short half-life, feels like being drunk but without the effects of alcohol ingestion. Good for insomnia and panic attacks, especially if you need quick relief that doesn&#039;t last into the next day. I&#039;ve taken tons of this stuff and never really felt any euphoria, although it does enhance weed highs and the like. Grapefruit juice enhances the effects of Xanax for me, as well as making it last longer.<br /><br />K-pins (clonazepam) - Takes a while to kick in, even if you try to take it sublingually. Not as good as Xanax for recreational use, but feels great when you need it for actual anxiety. You can still function more or less normally on this stuff, and it&#039;s great for helping rough sleepers actually sleep still throughout the night. The half-life sucks though, especially if you take it &quot;once in a while&quot; only to realize it&#039;s been in your system for weeks. I actually felt some mild withdrawals that way! Grapefruit juice didn&#039;t really have much effect when I tried it with k-pins, not that it&#039;s needed anyway lol.<br /><br />Ativan (lorazepam) - Feels a lot like Xanax to me, except with more amnesia and even more sedation. Great for insomnia!<br /><br />I never tried Valium, although it&#039;s rumored around here to be the most euphoric benzo. My friends hate it, but that&#039;s because they rip you off for it in this area.

Meanwhile he gives my mother 30 xanax .25mg because she too needed something for a flight. WTF? I would take the Xanax any day over Ativan. Ativan can fuck with my vision even at 2 or 3mg doses and it kills my concentration span for at least 12 hours. Xanax is quick and short and can leave me feeling fresh about 3 to 4 hours after a small dose.<br />I find I only use Valium when I&#039;m looking for some good muscle relaxation. I find it works best for me.<br />Kpins are good for if you don&#039;t want to be slurring your speech and just want to get through your day with no anxiety and a slight mood lift.<br />Midazolam was good for me in hospital when used to help put you to sleep as it left me with no after effect the next morning.<br />Etizolam 1mg was cool, kinda like ativan 0.5mg mixed with kpin 0.5 mg except it lasted only like 3 hours tops for me.

				You don&#039;t want to just look at strength. Generally benzos are shit if they have a long half-life, and good if they have a short half-life.<br />I hear good things about Midazolam and (although it is not a benzo) even better things about Zaleplon.
