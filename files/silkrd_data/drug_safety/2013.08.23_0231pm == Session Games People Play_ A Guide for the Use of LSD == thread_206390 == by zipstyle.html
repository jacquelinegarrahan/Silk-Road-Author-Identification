				http://www.luminist.org/archives/session.htm<br />I think this is a must-read for all LSD users and explains many of the seemingly strange or bizarre experiences that don&#039;t make much sense. This guide helps to optimize the time spent in the LSD headspace and maximize your use of the trip. <br /><br />I hope this is as helpful to all of you (especially the LSD first-timers) as it was to me!

When I discovered it, I wondered why it wasn&#039;t referenced more often. I think that people need to be educated in what the psychedelic experience offers, not just what pretty shapes, colors, and hallucinations it can procure. I hope that the link or the contents of it may become well-known once again (as it seems that this pamphlet was quite common back when it was originally published).<br /><br />All the best!

				Yup, was actually reading through this before I went to bed last night.<br />Was in the middle of an MXE haze though and didn&#039;t finish it though.<br />Great post as always, Zip!<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the How High You Are Chart and this quote.<br /><br />&quot;In fact, it’s best to set aside all expectations as much as possible. LSD will almost certainly be different from anything you might expect, so why not go into it acknowledging that it is unknown territory. This may have the advantage of rescuing you from the self - defeating game of How High Am I? Like the proverbial watched pot that never boils, some people manage to hold themselves down by continually looking for symptoms and trying to see whether they are high yet. Since you don’t know what the LSD state is like, there is no point in trying to figure out whether you have gotten there. Assuming it is genuine LSD, and you have taken enough of it, it will do its part. If you must know how high you are, look at the clock. The time schedule of an LSD session goes something like this:&quot;<br /><br />The graph is eerily accurate for the time period, though I do believe the Erowid one is a bit more spot on.<br />Then again, never underestimate the power of an acid trip.<br />Either way, it was a fun read - and I&#039;ll probably read the rest later today.<br />I love classic literature like this.<br />Thanks for posting.<br /><br />Vanquish

				Zip, I have a question in regards to Session Games and I guess psychedelics in general.<br />Ever since my horrible experience with 25I-NBOMe I often find myself getting caught in thought loops and recursive thinking.<br />Back in the day I could usually just snap myself out of it instantly, either through changing set or setting or thinking to myself &quot;STOP IT&quot;, or keeping silent.<br />Anything along those lines.<br /><br />The looping was something that had predominately shown itself occasionally with other substances throughout my lifetime, but I&#039;ve never experienced it to the magnitude of the 25I.<br />Ever since then some of my trips are showing that same dominance to get stuck in a loop.<br />I&#039;m not exactly sure if these are lingering effects, or something that needs to be restructured in my own mind to fix in the future.<br />Usually silence, meditation, and strong will power can bring take them away.<br />But I&#039;m finding this more and more difficult.<br /><br />TLDR -<br />For those of us that are finding us caught in loops, or negative thinking based on the session games and your experience in general how would you solve this problem?<br /><br />&lt;3 Vanquish

This happened to me once, long long ago when I took a much too large dose of psychedelics. After lurking around the internet for a bit, I found that I had some of the symptoms of drug psychosis, which is not too difficult to achieve when there is a lack of sleep, any levels of stress or anxiety, and high-dose drug use. The solution for me was to not use any drugs for a while, relax, and give my mind some time to heal and come to terms with reality.

				Fascinating read.<br /><br />What are people&#039;s thoughts on her advice about avoiding tripping on your own? I did LSD a couple of times 20 years ago and fancy doing it again. I&#039;m not sure any of my friends would join me so I&#039;ll be doing it on my own. I hadn&#039;t thought about the points she raised about doing it in a group until now.
