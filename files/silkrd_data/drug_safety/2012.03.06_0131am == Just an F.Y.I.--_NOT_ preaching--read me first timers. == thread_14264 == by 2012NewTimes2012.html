				I AM NOT PREACHING.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />However, for those asking questions about taking a new drug for the first time---don&#039;t go BALLS OUT---there&#039;s no need to. Everyone&#039;s body reacts different--and just ramp up as you learn to enjoy the experience. My 6&#039;2--300lb buddy (because he does EVERYTHING in excess--his first time he dropped 2-hits..not wise for a first timer...but he thought he was not tripping (when mine kicked in)--because he needed &quot;more&quot; because of his &quot;Size&#039; (doesn&#039;t work that way).&nbsp; And he was BALLS OUT tripping---THANK GOD---stuff did not go side ways with him----none of us could have controlled him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d hate to hear so and so overdosed...and think about it---if it&#039;s your first time, do you really want a Cop and a Priest showing up at your Parents house to inform them you&#039;re at the Morgue from an overdose....at lest me...I don&#039;t want my Pop having that as his last memory of me. <br /><br />I&#039;m 100% pro Legalization. I think it&#039;s CRIMINAL Marijuana is more &quot;outlawed&quot; than Cocaine (I was given Cocaine for a Nose Job--as an anesthetic)---just STUPID Marijuana is. It&#039;s just my &quot;nature&quot; to be a kind,caring, &quot;look out for someone&quot;--kind of guy. AGAIN, *NOT* preaching---just my advice..take it for what it is<br />(and DEFINITELY know what kind of &quot;supplies&quot; you need whlle Partying--lots of Water with MDMA---something &quot;special&quot; on a Trip (you know, Music you love that can chill you out if you start having a bad trip)--doing other &quot;hard core&quot; stuff...probably best to stay away from the public so you don&#039;t get yourself int a fight <br /><br />Heck first 5-times I tried to smoke pot (in High School)--Private school Dorm--my roommate had to &quot;teach me&quot;--he said the only thing he could think is I was not inhaling enough...So, I&#039;d go outside and smoke it in our Garage--And I&#039;d puff out my cheeks---as long as I could hold it (like that Trumpet Player dude)---and finally got stoned<br /><br />So, just know a lot of times you might get ripped off, or wont work as expected. Don&#039;t use that as an excuse to double/triple up the next time you take something. <br /><br />Ironically, the only good Ecstasy I&#039;ve ever had was in Dallas, TX (it was one of the states it was legal the longest---so can get some good stuff from there)---best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				good advice and for those to lazy to read the whole post you can sum it up in one saying. you can always take more of a drug but you can never go back and take less. that should be everyone&#039;s drug use mantra

				Ultimately you can&#039;t tell anyone anything.<br /><br />The only way to learn the lessons is to actually make the mistakes and think them up for yourself.<br /><br />It&#039;s the only way any lasting understanding can be gained, through your own experience.<br /><br />So whilst I&#039;d agree that you may as well take less and then top up, if someone reading this wants to take more (not an LD50 sorta dose obviously), I&#039;d say go ahead. That way if they fuck up and throw up everywhere/dissolve into nothingness they&#039;ll actually have learnt something for themselves.

If people wanna fuck up, let them fuck up, and either they&#039;re stupid enough to die off or they learn and come back the wiser. No use trying to tell everyone what to do and not to do, regardless of your intentions. I don&#039;t want to see anyone die and will advise them to start slow, but if somebody says &quot;i&#039;m not tripping/high&quot; or whatever, I can do nothing but take them on their word and let them make a pimp decision on what to do next.
