				Anyone source jet injectors? <br /><br />Ya know, the kind you often see in movies sort of looks like a weird pellet gun? Yes they are real, and no I can&#039;t find them anywhere. <br /><br />Did find a few company names that made them, but they are either out of business or have modified the injector for Diabetes only :(<br /><br />Anyone know where to get them?

				Jet injectors deliver subcutaneously which is the same as skin popping with a needle which in turn is a quick way to get a dangerous infection and abscess.<br /><br />Stick to snorting.

				Snorting not possible; talking HGH. Also, not all jet injectors are subcutaneous.<br /><br />This one for example is both intramuscular &amp; subcutaneous via a setting. <br />http://www.bioject.com/biojector2000.html<br /><br />Did some more research, and HGH can be in sc or im so just need to find a good jet injector!

Also you will need proper PCT or say hello to your lovely new female tits.

				@dumdedum<br />Thanks for your concern; no not steroids... I don&#039;t want no bob&#039;s bitch tits!! HGH instead! <br /><br />Thankfully HGH can be administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly... just need to find a source to buy a decent jet injector. Think i&#039;d prefer subcutaneous as takes less depth and sc jet injectors are more common.<br /><br />Anyone know where to start on this? Google is sadly not my friend on this one (tried searching, didn&#039;t find any suppliers that sell to end users).
