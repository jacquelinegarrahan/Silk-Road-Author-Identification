				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m preparing for my second experience with MDMA, and this time I would like to be as informed as possible. The first time was awesome, but I was super cautious and very disinformed too, so I probably fell short with the dose.<br /><br />I&#039;m an average sized guy (75kg) but highly sensitive to everything. I&#039;ve read that a low dosing starts somewhere around 1mg/kg, so I was planning on starting with 70mg. I&#039;ve read that after the initial dose you won&#039;t get more intensity by taking extra doses, but you will will only get longer effects.<br /><br />My question is: if the 70mg dose turns out to be too low, is it ok to try and dose myself up to a proper high by taking small doses each hour or so?

				I&#039;m 60kg and I start at 200mg with 100mg top-ups until the gram is gone.

				Thanks dude, but as I&#039;ve said... second time for me, no tolerance at all, extremely sensitive to any other stuff, so I&#039;ll definitely have to go with significantly lower doses.<br /><br />Actually, what I&#039;m concerned about is not being able to feel the effects if I start with a too-low dose. So more than the actual amount of M I should take, I want to learn about how it works.<br /><br />For you, does the 100mg top-ups increase the intensity or just make them last longer?

				I only take it about once every year or two myself. I&#039;d go with the dosage listed above. Certainly no lower than 150mg for starters. Yeah it brings back the intensity but it doesn&#039;t last as long.<br /><br />Me and my friends will get a gram and split it between two people then each person split the gram in two: 250mg start then 250mg topup.

				I usually take 100 mg. In my finding, that&#039;s the peak intensity per amount of milligrams for me. No reason why you can&#039;t space out your dosings five hours apart to lengthen a trip.<br /><br />Though, recall MDMA is of generally unknown neurotoxicity. And remember the 5-HTP!

				With good MDMA 125mg x 2 bombs should be fine, take one about 20 mins before your going out and then the other one about 3-4 hrs into the night. Done this several times and its been fine every time, I took 500mg to myself in 1 night and actually ended up having a headache by 5am after going out at 11pm. Always bomb as well lasts a lot longer anything else is silly really :)

				There&#039;s a lot of this mg per kg body weight talk out there, but that&#039;s mainly because the FDA required such dosage information&nbsp; waybackwhen studies were still legal. Of course this info is crucial when it comes to determining the LD50 of&nbsp; a drug, but not so much when it comes to the sweet&nbsp; spot.<br /><br />If you dig a little deeper, you&nbsp; can find just as much information, some documented and some of a more conjectural nature, that hints at the fact that 125mg initial&nbsp; with a 40mg booster seems to be some sort of sweet spot of experiencing the full empathogenic-entactogenic potential of E without drowning it out with too much speed-like side effects. When MDMA was still used in psychotherapy that was the standard dosage, regardless of gender or weight.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing this stuff since the early 90s, and from then to now my&nbsp; body has undergone tremendous change. I was a skinny fuck back then, I mean really skinny,&nbsp; and now I&#039;m a solid 240 pounds (more&nbsp; muscle than fat). Yet that 125 starter used to work for me&nbsp; for a long time. Admittedly, my starter now is 180 to 220, but that&#039;s only because my long years of use have very much diminished the &quot;magic&quot;, and now I have to derive more of my pleasure from the more physical effects.<br /><br />All in all I&#039;d definitely recommend you try a 125 as starter dose. Even if you respond really sensitive it will only hype you out for an hour or so, and then when you hit the plateau you will calm down automatically and get more of the lovey dovey&nbsp; pixie dust feeling.

				Thank you guys for your replies, specially you johnwholesome for your elaborate answer. <br /><br />I&#039;ve certainly read about the 125mg/40mg pattern, but I have a couple concerns about it:<br /><br />First, are we talking about 125mg MDMA.HCI (the crystal as it is sold, ~84% pure MDMA) or 125mg of pure MDMA? If the former, then I should take 145mg (125*1.16) of crystal. If the latter, that would be 105mg (125*0.84) of crystal. I already brought this subject in another thread and got some information (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31353.msg412251#msg412251) but actually my question is still unanswered. I&#039;ll try to figure it out, anyway.<br /><br />I also am worried about being hit too hard by the first dose: as I said I&#039;m quite sensitive (I had a really bad LSD trip 15 years ago, which brought anxiety/panic problems and kept me away from drugs until now) and I think I might get scared if the onset is very violent.<br /><br />Last, if any of you guys have tried eazyjet&#039;s crystal I&#039;d like to know if you consider it to be good stuff. I&#039;ve just ordered a gram and that will be the M I&#039;ll be using for this, my first well-planned roll.<br /><br />Thanks again!

If the report says 125mg of crystal then it&#039;s 125mg of crystal. Nothing to multiply.<br /><br />I&#039;d go with 150mg for a nice trip. Reports would talk of the crystal weight, so if you wanna take 125mg take 125mg. I know a few people who took 250mg their first time and loved it.

				You know, to be honest I haven&#039;t even pondered that question yet. AFAIK, don&#039;t nail me on it tho, I think you can&#039;t really get much higher then 84 to 86. So presumably, that&#039;s about the type of material they used back then in the lab studies.<br /><br />I can tell you one thing tho, even if 125 will hit you hard, it will not turn into some freakshow nightmare. Granted you might get really speed-amped for a little bit, but that settles rather quickly. Imho the worst that would happen is instead of deep conversation you&#039;d be more like babbling through clenched teeth and you&#039;d either be&nbsp; lying very still for a bit or twitching like a frog in a blender. However, you&#039;d likely still perceive both options as enjoyable.<br /><br />TBH every time I heard or read about people &quot;allegedly&quot; going bonkers on a standard dose I thought...uhm....ya..... must have been some mephedrone/meth/caffeine pill.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I&#039;ve been doing this stuff for nearly 20 yrs now, and I wasn&#039;t always smart, meaning, I have had stupid times in my life where I&#039;d pop 400 for starters and boost 30 minutes later (which is total waste of course). If you have pure MDMA the worst that will happen is a severely clenched up jaw, twitching eyeballs, sensation of heat, dry mouth. Nothing like a &quot;psychotic breakdown&quot;.<br /><br />The scientifically accepted threshold value for any experience is 30 mg, considering that you were fine with the 70 you had I believe you&nbsp; got quite some air in there before you would experience unpleasant side effects.<br /><br />Let me put it this way, every single person I know that uses MDMA will qualify their first experience as one of the most profound experiences of their life. So if your 70 mg from your first try didn&#039;t hit you like that, then you have quite some leeway upwards. If it&#039;s too much of a scare start with 110. They say boosting will not increase the intensity but only prolong the experience, but I have found that if you boost very shortly after the initial onset, you can still crank up the volume and still keep boosting when you feel you&#039;re coming off the plateau.<br /><br />So watch your onset, in if its creeping in really slow and non-threatening to you boost a small load immediately. This way you keep a little more control over how high you will get.<br /><br />Hope this helps, stay safe...

				Eazyjet is not among the vendors that have the really strong gear. I hear it&#039;s a good value for the lower risk in shipping from Spain instead of NE but it&#039;s not going to be the strongest rocks you&#039;ve tried. So you should do fine on 125mg. <br /><br />How much did you take your first time?<br /><br />You can also get some ghb or 1,4b if you&#039;re really concerned about an overly strong experience. 1g will take the edge of a hard/speedy roll without killing it (I&#039;m in the low hundreds and that&#039;s how much I take). If you take it in with your molly, it will also relieve your anxiety about the come-up.

				Guys, thanks a lot for your replies. Now I feel I have enough information to have a safe and enjoyable roll :)<br />I&#039;m not sure how much I took during my first experience: we split a gram for me and two friends and had like 7 really small doses for each of us throughout two consecutive nights.<br />We dissolved them in shot glasses filled with beer every couple of hours.<br />I felt dizzy (vertigo) at some points but had an overall great time, though it probably was very tame judging by what I&#039;ve read about first experiences.<br />My friends feelt almost anything :-(<br />No wonder it wasn&#039;t completely successful as now I know we got everything quite wrong in terms of dosing and administration.<br /><br />I&#039;ll report back after my new experience (end of september).<br /><br />Thanks again, guys!

				The good thing about Molly is that it&#039;s dosage is very forgiving, so don&#039;t sweat it so much.&nbsp; Seriously, whether you bomb 75mg or 250mg, it&#039;s not going to kill you.&nbsp; Part of the fun for me was trying different doses and dosing techniques, and that&#039;s the great thing about crystals and gel caps!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;m 90kgs and do it every other week, and generally I like about 150-160mg, so at 75kg you could try 125mg and see where it takes you. At T-3:00 or so, if you&#039;re not high enough, I recommend snorting a booster of about 1/3rd the initial dose.&nbsp; That&#039;s what works for me.<br /><br />The thing I find with molly, is that there is a ceiling to the peak.&nbsp; If you take more, you don&#039;t get proportionally higher, you just extend the duration and the peripheral effects.&nbsp; One night when I did 250mg, I was getting little pushes 48hrs later. I found the skittishness and jaw clenching pretty annoying.&nbsp; The shit just wouldn&#039;t stop.<br /><br />Anyway, just remember to keep up the fluid intake, don&#039;t overheat, and you&#039;ll have a fantastic time.
