				This thread should be specifically dedicated to any crazy to sad to funny exp&#039;s on any type of benzo&#039;s including &#039;&#039;Xanax&#039;&#039;. <br /><br />Just share your story say what you feel about it keep it as simple as you want to or as detailed as you want to ^.^<br /><br /><br />note-I have found that a lot of people don&#039;t like benzo&#039;s but in my exp I got to admit it there has been some crazy funny black out moments on them so lets try to keep this uplifting and fun to read.<br /><br /><br />One of my stories on xanax: I was going to go hang out with two of my girl-friends and there boy friends we were supposed to go to a party, before she picked me up I took 4 2mg xanax bars so by the time she picked me up I was &#039;&#039;bar&#039;d out&#039;&#039;. Well they had liquor in the car and kept daring me to drink./ NOTE- Xanax is not a good combination when taken more than 2mg and mixing it with alc.- NOTE / Literally my first couple shots and 10 mins after I start blacking out I kept waking up and I was just like a zombie, I woke up when we arrived to the party, blacked out. Woke up when we were at a random gas station blacked out, woke up randomly in my friends complex and was smoked a blunt, blacked out. Finally woke up in my bed with just my panties on. Now of course I was in shock so I called all the friends from the night and here&#039;s how the story goes in their perspective.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;I was apparently walking around like mindless zombie and at the party I was falling like a complete fool making an idiot of myself. <br />&nbsp;By the time we got to her complex I was smoking a clip from this guy&#039;s last stash that he was nice enough to let me hit it and I ended up hogging the blunt .-. I ended up telling all my girl&#039;s boy friends that I want to fight them and they were giving me the ride home. I was a big pain in the pass to everyone and they wanted to take me to my door cause I was so messed up I could barley walk. I ended up throwing a fit and didn&#039;t let them for some reason see where my house door was in my complex. So I ended up just getting of the car. They told me themselves it was a miracle I made it home in one piece. Apparently in my step dads view I couldn&#039;t walk in the house I couldn&#039;t even put the key in the keyhole but after so much little noises it was 3 am I mind you he opened the door and had to carry me to my room and I&#039;m sure I ended up undressing my self like a zombie and laying in my bed.;;<br /><br />^ This was almost two years ago I&#039;ve learned a lot since then and never mix my xanax with alc. and of course I take it way more responsibly now . <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This goes to show you how much of a fun night I could have had if I didn&#039;t give in to peer pressure and took the liquor which just blacked me out cause&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of my xanax. I feel it could have been worse tho, My friends forgave me of course lol. But hey besides the pain in the ass I was I feel as EVERY rebelling teenager must HAVE at least 1 or 2 nights in their teenage life were they black out and just wake up like &#039;&#039;wtf man?&#039;&#039; haha.<br /><br />Please share your stories or tuff times or anything at all on benzo&#039;s :)<br />

				You should be a bit careful with benzo&#039;s really. <br /><br />I once made the mistake of taking temazepam to sleep on a flight - nothing really bad happened, but i found myself in singapore&#039;s changi airport with litle to no idea how i got there at all.&nbsp; Obviously i had several drinks on that flight as well causing the big memory gap. I just walked to arrivals, cleared immigration without a problem, only to discover my luggage had been mislabeled and was 12 hours behind me and to be delivered later that day.<br /><br />This is quite some time ago however, and i would never use temazepam for that purpose again today. <br /><br />

				The combination of alcohol and benzo&#039;s often results in some amnesia indeed... but temazepam is pretty bad in this respect compared to alprazolam, oxazepam and such, at equivalent effective dosages. <br /><br />Rohypnol (flutrinazepam) is sort of the textbook example of amnesia inducing benzo&#039;s, but some others will do that trick on the mind quite well too. These are often described at date-rape drugs, although i&#039;m not all that sure why. Surely they cause amnesia to some degree, but they will not really incapacitate a person all that easily. Despite the memory loss people are often left strong enough to defend themselves on this combination, even if they do not remember putting up a fight the morning after.

				Ended up with a tranny in my apartment.

				When I was about 18 I got a couple hundred 10mg valiums and I was stoned for months. Drinking beer the whole time. Driving atound in my vehicle drinking beer, stoned on the pills and selling joints and eighths at the high schools. Hit a big dumpster with the front of my vehicle when I though I could make a u-turn. Big bang, garbage bin bounced and rocked around, but there was almost no damage to my bumper. It was fun being young and carefree.<br /><br />I also got the 10mg blue pills buy the thousand later in life, direct from some guy who got large pharmacy jars for pain issues somehow. I took them with T3s and Percocets for years, until I found a good doc who prescribes my oxycodone pills with no acetaminophin. Man I had some stretches of my life when I was taking tons of those pills and was just wasted. All my good friends totally noticed I was wasted on the pills.<br /><br />It&#039;s much better to have legally prescribed pain meds. Best value for $$$, if I wasn&#039;t on them I could make a fortune selling the amount I get rXed.

				I agree as mentioned that ive noticed many instances of woman being sexually assaulted while on benzos..most of the time not remembering exactly what happened. Some one from my neighborhood is actually doing 15 years upstate right now, for &#039;rape&#039;. I was not present for what actually happened, but from all eye witness accounts the girl was consenting to sexual relations with this person, then the next day idk, felt like a slut or w.e.. long story short, she claims she was not coherent to consent to sex and the dude is spending some serious time in the can for it. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;My own personal tale of the take, among many many many other stories, the worst would have to have been waking up handcuffed to a hospital bed, stitches all over my arms and hands, with the LEO telling me i was being charged for assault. Apparently during a night out at a club, an altercations presented it self to me, to which i reacted like some sort of animal..again long story short, I attacked some people in their car, breaking through the windows and fucking my self up real good, lost so much fucking blood and now all the scars on my arms looking like i tried to kill my self.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Itd be safe to say that 90% of the scars on my body are attributed directly or indirectly to xanax. For the past 7 yrs or so, ive managed to steer clear of benzos for recreational use.. only to sleep or come down from a trip or anxiety attack.

				I suppose the legal system can be crazy like that - although in europe it doesn&#039;t seem to bu that bad at the moment for situations like you describe. <br /><br />I&#039;m not really sure what to make of the story of taking xanax and going violent up to the point of smashing through car windows and such. Xanax certainly does not cause such behaviour, even in combination with alcohol, but i can image someone would forget about the ordeal and wondering what the heck happened. <br /><br />As far as that goes i doubt many people do odd things on benzo&#039;s at all, apart from traffic when taken enough to be unfit to drive comparable to drinking too much alcohol but with the added effect of forgetting all about it. <br /><br />If you are normally and aggressive person using benzo&#039;s will not change that ofcourse, but i&#039;ve never seen any normally docile person go beserk and hurt himself or others after taking a couple of xanax. Some hurt themselves by stumbling over things and landing face down on the floor, but that&#039;s another story ;)

They are known to cause ridiculous rage..AKA Xanax rage, or Stick Rage it has been dubbed here in the states. <br /><br />Yes, obviously if you took so many that you cant walk or talk there would be no harm you could do, but when it a habit and you got some bars in your blood, it makes you a mad man.. kind of like beer muscles, you feel like the biggest baddest muhhfucka any ones ever seen, lol.

				Luckily not, i don&#039;t use them in very large amounts. <br /><br />But while on the topic, when does this rage occur? While taking benzo&#039;s, or is it more of a withdrawal symptom that occurs after breaking a long streak of use?

				It can go both ways. As ive experienced it, it would come from all angles. The worst usually being the morning after. I would wake up the next day and everything would always seem fine, until some one rubbed me the wrong way, then i was like David fucking Banner,&nbsp; start turning colors and shit foaming from the mouth looking to snatch life out of whom ever it may have been. <br /><br />&nbsp;Then like in my story there, just a night out at the club, few drinks a xanax bar or three, some one tried to disrespect me or my people, dont remember fully, and the switch was flipped.. i literally broke into their car as they tried to get out of the parking lot, with my bar hands.. i had like 50 stitches or something like that, lost like 2 pints of blood or some shit. I was picked up by an ambulance after the cops grabbed me up in the middle of the grand central parkway in astoria new york&nbsp; soaked in blood fighting with motorists in traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;In small amounts, when used as intended, they work wonders. As for a &#039;fun&#039; drug.. theres nothing fun about them.

				3 bars does not sound like an insane amount though. Surely its a bit more than is recommended, but it&#039;s not a boatload either.<br /><br />I suppose it depends between people - with amounts like that i just want to sleep, though i can imagine punching someone if the face for keeping me awake :D

				If you have been taking 8 x 2 mg clonazepam a day for some time (say a month or more) it is very likely you are addicted or at least dependent.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re a junky or a lost cause or anything like that - as you mention you are still able to perform your job and all. When buying in bulk amounts i suppose the cost of the habit isn&#039;t ruining your life either - realistically in most western countries smoking a pack a day is as expensive as downing a strip of benzo&#039;s if your choice a day. Functional benzodiazepine addicts are quite normal, though most keep it to say 3 or 4 bars of xanax a day. You are however taking quite a large amount, and i&#039;d think that would impair your functioning in some respect. The risk is that you will eventually use benzo&#039;s in situations where you should be in full control of your faculties - such as driving, but if you are a mechanic also while doing your work. <br /><br />I&#039;m not here to lecture you though. If you have been taking this amount and functioning for a long period of time, i suppose the conclusion must be that you can. Just try to keep it to as low an amount as you can, and taper off a bit if you can. Also, be careful with the alcohol. Having a beer or two is not that likely to pose extreme danger, but if you go out of a night of drinking while taking that amount of clonazepam there is a serious risk of respiratory depression. Tolerance will not prevent that completely - something you should consider if you ever consider getting seriously drunk.

I&#039;m not sure how much packs cost around where you reside, but a strip of benzos (10 x) is usually $25.00 USD if you are lucky but can go up to $35.00 USD+ . Big difference than to buying a pack a day. Cigg packs usually go for $6.50 USD + here.

				As for the price comparison: i live in holland and the retail price for 19 cigarettes here is 6 euros. If you are buying in bulk (say by the thousand) tablets of 2 mg clonazepam, 1 mg alprazolam or 10 mg diazepam can be bought at 10 pcs for 6 euros easily on silkroad. <br /><br />Obviously i buy my cigarettes from SR as well so i do not pay these crazy prices from them (tnx, only), but i meant it just as a comparison of pricing.<br /><br />Shipping is a cost factor with pills though: you will not be able to order 10 tablets of 1 mg xanax for what you pay for a pack of smokes, but by the time you order 500 tablets in one purchase you will end up well under $1 a piece with a bit of negotiating.

When buying in bulk amounts i suppose the cost of the habit isn&#039;t ruining your life either - realistically in most western countries smoking a pack a day is as expensive as downing a strip of benzo&#039;s if your choice a day. Functional benzodiazepine addicts are quite normal, though most keep it to say 3 or 4 bars of xanax a day. You are however taking quite a large amount, and i&#039;d think that would impair your functioning in some respect. The risk is that you will eventually use benzo&#039;s in situations where you should be in full control of your faculties - such as driving, but if you are a mechanic also while doing your work. <br /><br />I&#039;m not here to lecture you though. If you have been taking this amount and functioning for a long period of time, i suppose the conclusion must be that you can. Just try to keep it to as low an amount as you can, and taper off a bit if you can. Also, be careful with the alcohol. Having a beer or two is not that likely to pose extreme danger, but if you go out of a night of drinking while taking that amount of clonazepam there is a serious risk of respiratory depression. Tolerance will not prevent that completely - something you should consider if you ever consider getting seriously drunk.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s hard to say, it&#039;s either take benzos or take the psychotropic cocktail of death my psychiatrist wants to give me (lamictal, lithium, and seroquel, all at +100mg doses), which turns me into a zombie. I&#039;m picking the lesser of two evils until I can find a job that lets me smoke weed or try, shit, ANYTHING, without having my ass worried about being fired. Jobs are hard to come by these days.

				Haha - here&#039;s 2 shit stories.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had Valium (Diazepam) many times, I&#039;ve had doses of up to 50mg without falling asleep or drowsy. They work really well for me as an antianxiolotic, but not so well as a recreational drug.<br /><br />Anyway, got some Xanax (Alprazolam), and thought it would be the same. Had 4mg, and caught up with a mate for beers. Had roughly 2L of beer, do not remember ANYTHING. He said &#039;I just decided to call it a night early, you seemed like you weren&#039;t interested in what I was saying&#039;.<br /><br />Another night, mixed Heroin and Xanax, without knowledge of the effects. Anyway - ended up being a success story (read up before you try it, i wouldn&#039;t recommend it), felt like the H was stronger, had an emergency and my partner needed me to drive somewhere (she doesn&#039;t), she kept having to wake me up at the red lights. That part of the story was stupid, and dangerous (I don&#039;t DUI as a rule), but the effect was great.

				For what it is worth:<br /><br />I have seen people addicted to benzos, having just as hard of a time, coming off them, as it it was heroin... Scary.<br /><br />Luckily benzos are not my &quot;poison&quot; I do enjoy coming down on them from a C high from time to time. And my favorite of all time was Rohypnol. I havent been able to find it for years though (Which is both good and bad, I guess).

				How much did those people having an extremely hard time coming off benzo&#039;s&nbsp; use?<br /><br />I suppose people on doses that are within the medically applied range (say 3 x 1, maybe 2, mg xanax a day) would not have any reason to actually stop using them, since they can still function perfectly well and the habit is inexpensive enough to keep up for life if you want to. <br /><br />Benzo&#039;s in general just are not very good recreational drugs. Perhaps using a large amount will produce a sensation compared to drinking a fair amount of alcohol, but besides that there just is no high, trip, or anything overly pleasant to look forward to. Surely its possible to get into a sort of inebriated state when just taking a large amount of benzo&#039;s, but i fail to see how that is preferable to just having a few too many drinks.

I do however love how they can calm my nerves and relax after a coke trip. <br />That is also why many ppl. who does cocaine often get a mixed substance abuse. Coke to get them high, but because it is rarely pure enough, they need benzos to calm the nerves, so they don&#039;t get that jittery &quot;speedy&quot; feelings, and sometimes even paranoia.

				It may very well work like that. Perhaps people have xanax in the morning when having a drink at that time i socially not accepted.<br /><br />I do wonder what the big deal is though: haven&#039;t we always used coffee in the morning and alcohol in the afternoon when going about our jobs? These substances may have been replaced with coke and benzo&#039;s for some people, but isn&#039;t that the exact same thing?<br /><br />

				for some reason when i was pretty drunk and on quite a bit of klonipin I thought it was a good idea to rail .5 of some of jamesbrown&#039;s really good MDMA<br /><br />All I remember was snorting it in like 3 snorts (my buddy dumped the bag out to split up between like 5 people) looking at my friend and saying &quot;holy shit why did i do that&quot;<br /><br />The next 3 hours were blackout but then I came to feeling fine and wanting to party and drink more.<br /><br />apparently while i was rolling I was pretty much thrashing around on my bed while water was being poured on me to keep me cool. Then when I finally got my shit together they said I went and just stood in between 2 giant speakers for 30 minutes with the biggest/worse thizz face listening to music...what happened next I&#039;m really embarrassed to say but...they said I then ended up &quot;expressing myself&quot; (dance move, if you dont know what it is look it up i suppose) in between the 2 speakers.<br /><br /><br />honestly though i feel like if I didn&#039;t have the benzo&#039;s in my system to keep me down a little that much molly could have ended up pretty bad
