				So I&#039;ve heard some interesting things about noopept. How safe is it really to take long-term? It sounded like a weaker version of the drug from the movie Limitless. Of course I want to buy some, but not if it fucks up my brain. Any info or links? Personal experiences?

				It&#039;s a pretty new compound and I don&#039;t think there&#039;s been any long term research done on it.<br /><br />But from how the compound works, I can&#039;t really see it being detrimental to your health.&nbsp; However, my self and a lot of other guys who are in the supplement industry know that some feel it working and some don&#039;t.<br /><br />Some may feel more clear headed and able to talk smoother, remember things easier, and etc but some don&#039;t really feel it.<br /><br />Good dose to use is 200mg per day.

				I have been dosing on noopept for around 3 months.<br /><br />3 x 10mg capsules daily supplemented with <br />2 x 150mg of choline bitartrate.<br /><br />After 1 week I noticed my mind was noticeably quicker and my ability to recall memories had improved. Colours seemed to &quot;pop&quot; more then usual. My creativity may have also improved however that is difficult to substantiate.<br /><br />3 months on, I&#039;d say the benefits have waned. Perhaps I should consider UPPING the dose. I have also read that you should cycle 3 months on, 1 month off. Maybe that&#039;s what I need to do.<br /><br />RE safety, I have experience zero concerns. I have consumed alcohol and acid however, I tend to only dose once on the day of acid consumption. I have also read that taking any amphetamine type substance and noopept is a NO-GO as the combined effect of both substances has a toxic effect at a neurotransmitter level on the brain. <br /><br />

I was drinking beer at the time so maybe there was a drug mix problem. I seriously was unable to play simple card games such as euchre. I have read where students are finding success through ADHD/ADD drugs. Not sure if I would partake in that practice. Just to reiterate, do not mix ADHD/ADD drugs and noopept due to its potential toxic effect as indicated earlier. Check out various forums which examine cross drug use to arrive at your own conclusion.<br /><br />Noopept seemed to create a mild brain fog when I 1st consumed....adding choline bitartrate may have eliminated the fog or maybe the fog diminished over time...difficult to say. If you are studying long term I would recommend noopept. Do not expect &quot;Limitless&quot; style experiences as you will be bitterly disappointed. Dosing levels are important and there are plenty of forums/discussions concerning this too which you should check out.<br /><br />To conclude my own experiences with Noopept...<br /><br />Colour perception seems to have been enhanced. I endure a mild &quot;floaty&quot; feeling within 30 minutes of consumption which is quite pleasant and may lead to continued use for that reason alone...(note: my experience, others may not support this claim.) I have noticed as a musician, that I have written more elaborate music though it is difficult to say whether this has been achieved through noopept consumption, acid consumption or a combination of both. I cannot gauge its effects on studying apart from noticing a general improvement in my memory. I will say that my memory improvement appears to have diminished though, as stated earlier, perhaps a dosing issue.<br /><br />Give it a go for 3 months after researching dosing and drug mix discussions. I look forward to reading about your experiences.
