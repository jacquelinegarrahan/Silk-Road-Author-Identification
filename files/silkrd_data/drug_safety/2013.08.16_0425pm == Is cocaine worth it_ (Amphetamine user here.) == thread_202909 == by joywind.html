				Since I use amphetamines, is there any point in trying cocaine? Is it basically the same high except shorter duration?

				no its not the same it&#039;s kinda stimulant-relaxing with more emotions high. if you inject it it gives a powerful bellringer rush - a feeling like falling from a plane on your back and your ears ringing.

				I&#039;d say stick to speed.

				If you chase (ice or&nbsp; speed) for 2+days better have some anti-oxidants and fish oil along with some liver supplement like Liv 52, Don&#039;t choose Milk Thistle liver supplement for this. <br /><br />Coke can do a decent job,if not cut/laced very much,basically off decent quality.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				As an amphetamine user (not meth), no it&#039;s not worth it. Amphetamine is cheaper and better. And I&#039;ve had the highest quality coke.

				If coke was cleaner and if it didn&#039;t cause me nose problems afterwards, then it would be my preferred party stimulant because it&#039;s more of a social drug - you not only chatter more, you also listen more! However the local street speed is no use at all - it&#039;s just sad watching people snort bucketfulls of the stuff without any obvious effects, apart from physical damage to their mucous membranes.<br /><br />So I&#039;m more than happy to stick with crystal meth. In my experience it&#039;s cleaner (especially in the crystal form), it&#039;s more powerful, it lasts longer (one good smoke and I&#039;m buzzing for 12 hours), and I don&#039;t get any comedowns (although it may be a few days before my sleep pattern returns to normal).<br />

It might be just my personality but I usually just wanna be on my own with my coke and will trick myself into getting away from situations to get away to do my coke!!! Hope this helps!

				Just to add, for example, I would now kill for a line of local shitty &quot;coke&quot; than I know is shite, just for a line! Don&#039;t wanna sound desperate but that&#039;s just the way it is!!!
