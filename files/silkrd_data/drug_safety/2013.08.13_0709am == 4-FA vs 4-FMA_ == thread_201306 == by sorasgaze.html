				Read up on these two and the argument seems to be pretty balanced, I was looking forward to getting one of these but not sure which. Anyone here have any personal experience with 4-FA or 4-FMA? Or experience with both of them would help me out even better. Also, can anyone recommend a good stimulant? I&#039;m really tired of MDPV, a-PVP and all that nasty pyrollide bullshit that people are ingesting when dirty chems like those are better off not even existing.

				You should search for both in the search bar...<br />I&#039;ve had a discussion about the molecules a few moths ago (so don&#039;t ask me the link to this page - it&#039;s way too far away in my comments) - I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find what you need there, or contact those who shared their info.

				4-fma lasts much longer. Re dosing with either for more than 8 hours leads to a very weird buzz, if you stay awake for more than a day or so on 4fa for instance you will start hallucinating. Well I always end up in a right state. The first 1-2 doses are really nice and clean though. Get your downers ready if you are using recreational doses (80-150mg). I like 150mg 4fa drunk in water, it dissolves 100%.

				I&#039;ve only taken 4-FA twice, but I love that shit. Bought another gram off FiberOptic. <br /><br />First time I took 50mg and went to the pool with a homie and two girls and had a good time, and conversation was very fluid. Later that night I took another 100mg and went to a party. Felt like a very light roll for the first 3-4 hours or so, then I just amphetamine like effects, but was drinking pretty heavily which brought the euphoria back. I definitely recommend drinking on this, especially if you like drinking on adderall. I was nearly black out drunk by the end of the night, but was not even the least bit tired. Oh, and the redose craving wasn&#039;t very strong at all, I barely had any except for the one redose, but I was planning on dosing before the party all along, but then again I am usually pretty good at not redosing multiple times on most substances.<br /><br />I might have t0 try 4-FMA out, though!
