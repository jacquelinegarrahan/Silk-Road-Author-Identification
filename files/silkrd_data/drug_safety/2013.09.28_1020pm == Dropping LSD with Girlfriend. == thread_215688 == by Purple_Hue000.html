				So we&#039;ve been talking and she&#039;s really interested and intrigued by the Psychedelic experience and she wishes to experience it.

				Yea start with one, too much acid can be overwhelming sometimes if you get stuck in bad thoughts......also not a bad idea to keep some valium or a faster acting benzo on hand JUST incase(also good for post trip to level back to earth). Last thing you want is to be stuck with no help holding a crying woman while she doesn&#039;t understand why the universe is collapsing.<br /><br />Edit; Just incase you dont know a strong benzo will abort an overwhelming acid trip thats why i suggest keeping them onhand.

				I think 200ug is a good starting dose. With small doses you can get a fealing of uneasiness where the larger amounts tend to cause euphoria. For me at least.

				&nbsp; Well the trip went really amazing!&nbsp; We dropped two hits each around 3:00 yesterday in the afternoon. Then we proceeded to walk to the nearby foothills to a trail where we found a nice, chill place to sit and wait for the come up. We laughed and played some mellow music. Smoked a bowl.&nbsp; As the effects started to come on we laughed and laughed and enjoyed each other&#039;s company. <br /><br />&nbsp;We walked the trail for a bit just observing the beauty in the world.&nbsp; It was a very familiar feeling (it&#039;s been while since I&#039;ve lasted tripped acid)&nbsp; This was her first time so she was pretty amazed but not completely mind blown.&nbsp; The tabs we had were clean but were weak. We ended up heading back to my place to drop another two tabs each which really got things going.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; we eventually headed back to the room where we laided naked and had good talks and sex for hours.&nbsp; We opened up so much with each other and felt our love on a whole new level and frequency; it was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp; She had difficult moments we got through the trip together. We felt so close and personal with each other mentally and emotionally. We were about to see past a lot of bullshit the sober mind would usually wouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />&nbsp;Our LSD trip also felt like a therapy session and it was nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;Psychedelics drugs are tools <br /><br />&nbsp;Overall we had a fantastic trip together and really bonded together and grew as a couple.&nbsp; We came to a lot of conclusions and epiphanies and had an amazing day. <br /><br />&nbsp;we woke up, cooked a nice breakfast and and headed out for the day.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Oh and fuck that shit about aborting a trip.&nbsp; That&#039;s for pussys real talk. If you&#039;re going through a bad trip just get through it, you&#039;ll learn something from it maybe and it&#039;ll only make that much stronger mentally. There&#039;s no point in aborting a trip. You buy the ticket you take the ride.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;There&#039;s no such thing as bad trips and good trips.&nbsp; There&#039;s only &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Difficult&quot; trips.&nbsp; Whether you have a so called bad trip or not isn&#039;t like a gamble like flipping a coin.&nbsp; If you take LSD the drug is always gonna do the same thing regardless.&nbsp;
