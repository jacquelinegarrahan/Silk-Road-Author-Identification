				&#039;Sup.&nbsp; Want to try meth for the first time.&nbsp; Read about the light bulb and foil tricks.&nbsp; Not coordinated enough for the bulb and just finished reading that foil post here on the forum.&nbsp; So no thanks.&nbsp; Want a good old fashioned meth pipe.&nbsp; I live in the US.&nbsp; No luck finding anything in stock online, and would prefer to buy more anonymously through SR.&nbsp; Want a new pipe.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a seller, maybe you put a custom order up? If you&#039;re a buyer and just happen to have a new pipe that won&#039;t easily break in transit, message me here on the forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, any tricks for a newbie, let me know.&nbsp; Take it light.

				Related, how much meth do you put into the pipe (or foil or whatever)?&nbsp; Say you buy 1 gram - I read somewhere that 1/4 gram is a good load.&nbsp; But want to be sure so no one gets hurt.

				I&#039;ve seen crack pipes (Valentine Rose Tubes) on E-bay, I&#039;m sure they have meth (bubble/oil burner) pipes there. And, it&#039;s not illegal to buy them.

Only smoke for one night or two at most, other wise you are gonna tweak and burn through your stash and be missing a couple of days. Anything that pops up out of no where type of experience and will be too high to deal with the situation comfortably.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath<br />
