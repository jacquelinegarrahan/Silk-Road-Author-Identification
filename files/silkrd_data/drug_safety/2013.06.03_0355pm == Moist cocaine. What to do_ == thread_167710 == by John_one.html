				By mistake i laid a bag of cocaine on top of a bag of moist speed.<br /><br />Now i seams like the cocaine absorbed some of the moist from the wet speed.<br /><br />Does it affect the quality of the cocaine, that it&#039;s a little moist? (It&#039;s more difficult to chop)<br />And how do i dry it without damaging the cocaine? (or do i just let it be a little moist and don&#039;t mind?)<br /><br />Never had this problem before but maybe somebody have the answer&nbsp; ???

				Take a thick glass oven safe plate and put it in the oven for 5 minutes or until its hot. Take it out of the oven and dump your coke on the hot plate, spread it around a bit. Shouldn`t take very long to dry the moisture out of your coke. Don`t put the blow in the oven it`ll melt. Microwaving a regular dinner plate for a few minutes till it gets hot works the same too. Just don`t put it on till you heat the plate up. Hope that helps you.<br />

				Another Idea if you got a lil time and dont want to use heat and have some rice lying around, just toss it in the bag of rise or some lil container you can put rice in then coke on top in&nbsp; something&nbsp; to hold it but open so rice can absorb moisture. an old trick alot of ppl use around these parts

				Another trick is to just leave it spread out on a small plate under a lamp for a few hours.

				Well I dont know where you get your cocaine from but pure 100% cocaine hcl is hygroscopic (means it pulls water out of the air and can start to turn to mush)<br />so if your cocaine is real moist, that means you got some real good shit! You mind giving up your vendors name?&nbsp; PM me if you dont wanna say it on the forums

				yeah hot plate is the way forward if you don&#039;t wanna wait hours (and lets face it, with coke who does??) the coke dries up really quick but its a bit crunchy, so careful when you go to crush it as it can ping everywhere

				I tried the rice trick, but i didn&#039;t think it made a big difference. Maybe i should had left it a little longer.<br /><br />The coke is from lexq. Bought a little while ago.<br /><br />I really appreciate the good ideas and solutions, that you guys have.<br /><br />Thanks :)<br /><br />And I&#039;ll update on the result off cause.&nbsp;

				Damn dude, I have been battling the moist coke for the past 2 weeks. I guess that mean that I have really good shit. All 3 types of coke that I have from columbia, bolivia, and peru all get moist very quick. I am still trying to perfect the art of not allowing moisture into it. Been doing a decent job. But, everyone out there that is interested, I will be opening up shop within the next 2 weeks and will be pumping out small samples of our product for real cheap. Everyone should try us out!

				Lol definitely, we have devised a way to get our product in a professional way to international locations. We probably will not choose to ship to Australia though. PM me if you want to talk details on prices or when and where we will be shipping.

				Im surprised the rice didnt work??? It always works great for us . in the hot humid summer we just store it in there . You gotta make sure the rice is able to extract the moisture but sealed from pulling moisture from anywhere else.

It will also absorb it anywhere it can get it, which means if the atmosphere is wet, the rice will sap it from the atmosphere as well as from the coke. It will do it eventually, but it could take time. If it is particularly good coke, the time is extended, because it wants to hold on to the water as well.<br /><br />That being said, also consider the reality of that fact: if it is good coke, it&#039;ll keep pulling moisture from the air, if it is available. You could leave rice there for a week (i don&#039;t suggest it, you&#039;ll risk some nasty toxins from the rice going bad...), and the coke would still be moist. If it is going on for a couple of weeks, or if it is persisting, chances are you are fighting your environments atmosphere as well. Humidity is the enemy of many things, especially hydroscopic drugs. The hot plate is probably the best idea in terms of speed, though you want to be sure you don&#039;t make the plate too hot and scold it. This is of course harder to do while the coke is wet, but if it dries and the plat stays too warm you could have the opposite effect to it.<br /><br />Is it in mylar or other types of moisture barrier containers, or is it in a typical plastic baggy? Remember that plastic baggies, especially ones that are essentially thinner (or thicker) cellophane, are permeable. Cellophane especially. It is EXTREMELY easy for moisture and humidity to affect drugs in these poorer containers. I learned that the hard way early on in my enjoyment of festivities when I had some pills in my pocket in a ziplock and they sucked in all the sweat.

				Whenever I have moist coke, I put a plate in the microwave on full power for 3 minutes. Then put another identical shaped plate on top of it (snug fit) then the coke on top of that plate.&nbsp; This stops the coke from melting or burning but is hot enough to dry it quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />It stops you accidentally burning your hand as you spread out the coke to dry and the plates will stay warmer for longer than with a single hot plate.

				What I do is, I put the coke on a plate and get a desk lamp and I put the lamp over the coke and leave it for about half an hour. Works everytime :)

				The plate in the oven trick worked like a charm.<br />The plate was no hotter, than i could take it out with my hands. But it dried it out completely. <br />So now I&#039;m the happy owner of dry cocaine instead of moist :D<br />
