				Hello fellow members!<br /><br />I have seen last week on Youtube a docu from Vice about what they call in Colombia &quot;Devils Breath&quot;. The host in the docu says compare it with the worst roofie times 1000!! I think the name is Scolopamine and in the docu they follow a crazy, but crazy as in fun crazy guy :D that tells about it and show you the tree from where it comes. It is a fruit they pick from the tree and inside is a seed and when chemicals are added like with cocaine you get a dangerous powder that looks as yayo but whit this you can put a certain dose in a drink or on a map and keep it close to your victim and then you have them in control. Real crazy shit! When you have someone in your power lets say they funtion normal and they do not look as if they are drugged they look sober but you say drive with me to the bank and empty you account and give it to me, the person does that and he gives you all his or her money while under control and then you can say drive me to that place go inside that bar and stab the guy on the bar with the white shirt.....The person will do anything and afterwards he or she doesn&#039;t know anything! In the docu you even hear a story of a dude that woke up in his crib and everything was gone! He asked the landlord were his stuff was and he answerd him : You were here yesterday with a couple friends taking all your stuff out....and then the dude said to his landlord : Why didn&#039;t you ask or stopped me, and the landlord had said the question : What are you doing, but the dude his answer was to let them do because it was ok....So that is freaking scary. You can have debts and see a man or woman with a Mercedes and expensive clothes and ask them the way on your map to a place and when you blow gently so it the person inhales it you wait a certain times and then you see that they get quid and then you just say : Go inside the bank and empty all your accounts and savings and give it to me and then just drive to your home because you are not feeling well so you go to your bed when you get home and try to get some sleep. Result you have a shitload off cash and the person wakes up or snaps out of it and when she goes later to the bank to get some money they say well misses X you have empty all your accounts and savings. And if she says that must be a mistake then even with cctv evidence they can show it to her + if she asks if she was drugged or drunk they will say no you were sober and she will never remember anything and be confused as hell.<br /><br />Now i have a person from who i must have some things to be honest and today i saw a seller that has this product and i orderd the minimum but now the important question because with 1gram you can kill 10-15 adults!! So very very very dangerous!<br /><br />Does somebody can give me some info how much is needed?? Also when you open the package with the powder you must have a mask and gloves because from just the smell you can start tripping or at least something. I saw that seller had 3 comms with feeddback but i can not log in on this moment so if anybody knows the dose to have somebody in your control, but somebody serious beccause if it is a little to much you can kill your target!<br /><br />Also if the seller read this...Is this washed with those chemicals? Because otherwise it is just used like LSD or Shrooms. So that i also must know that if i have the target that the person does not start to trip because then it will be a fucked up situation for sure + then the person is not productive... ;)<br /><br />Greettzz<br />

				wrote my small report here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90300.0 (4th post).<br /><br />I got the stuff naturally - leaves from from Datura (thornapple) from the farmacy (it was sold as &quot;cigarettes for asthmatics&quot; then ). <br />Datura contains scopolamine but as well hyoscoamine which is also psychoactive.<br /><br />We made tee on it and drank it - got the recipe and tip on where to get it from a book by Sten Larris - the section on nightshade plants of which datura is one is online in Danish here: (clearnet link)<br />http://www.stenlarris.dk/HALU/HNATSKYG.HTM<br /><br />rest of the book is there too - highly recommended but unfortunately only in danish<br /><br /><br /><br />
