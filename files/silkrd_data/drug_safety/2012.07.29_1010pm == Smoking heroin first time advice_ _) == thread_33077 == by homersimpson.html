				Okay so my friend has bought 250mg of Afghan brown heroin off here for him, me and another friend to try.<br />We have a crack pipe that we are going to smoke it from and full intend for this to be our 1st and last time trying it. I know a lot of people like that but we have our heads pretty screwed on or as much as you can while wanting to feel the full wonders of heroin. We have never experimented with other opiates which I understand is stupid but he has ordered it now so hey ho.<br />I&#039;d just like advice on dosage from the quality you can get on here? The seller said 3 times stronger than street so that made me unsure what purity of H erowid was speaking on.<br />We range from 9/11.5 stone, pretty thin framed lads.<br />Also in 1 sitting we were thinking of having 2 hits each so we were going to weigh out 2 medium hits each then dispose of any spare (wont be much I doubt) before we take it, removing any moreish cravings.<br />How long after the 1st hit should we wait for the second? That&#039;s if you&#039;d even advise the second hit.<br />What to do if someone OD&#039;s or how to know? If you feel tired keep awake right?<br />Also any advice for coming down? We have weed, MXE, 2cb, DMT in stock so any of these may be of use.<br /><br />Thanks for your time :)

				Hey Homer, don&#039;t reckon a crack pipe is your best option. Foil is the best way to chase. The liquid h could run all over the place, even into your mouth if it&#039;s really cut and the pipe would be black with residue really quick. Just get some decent tin foil, give the dull side a good cook with the lighter to burn off the crap and put the point of a knife&#039;s worth on. You&#039;ll have to make a sort of a trumpet shape of foil to inhale the smoke through or you can use the cardboard tube of a toilet roll. Don&#039;t use a straw, pen case or anything narrow like that, you&#039;ll lose all your smoke. Get one of your pals to either hold the foil (with the gear on) while you chase the h with the lighter (on the underside of the foil) or he can do the lighter and you hold the foil. The flame on the underside of the foil will liquidise the H and it will run along the foil. You then inhale the vapour as it rises. Anyway, you won&#039;t od but don&#039;t be doing it if you&#039;ve been heavily drinking or taking benzos or stuff like that. You may well puke, this is fairly standard with opiates so have a bucket handy. Check out Heroin Helper&#039;s site http://www.heroinhelper.com/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;s got loads of info. It&#039;s kind of trial and error unfortunately to start off with. The main trouble starting is trying to actually catch the fucking smoke&nbsp; :) Come downs off smack aren&#039;t like other drugs. You&#039;ll just go for a night&#039;s sleep and maybe have a slight headache the next day. Or a puke. Smack and puke are old pals&nbsp; :) Don&#039;t bother with any of that stuff except maybe a joint or 2 but personally I wouldn&#039;t even want that. The rest, forget it. Just relax and enjoy it. To be honest, the first toot can be underwhelming because it&#039;s best to have someone with you to show you the ropes. Heroin helper has quite a good solo method on his site but your pals and you will work it out. <br />have a nice one, Homer!!!!!

				Thank you! :) tinfoil and a toilet roll tube it is. Should I try and take it all in one hit or 2? Keep it back for long or just like a cigarette?<br />Yeah I think a join or two might help after if we don&#039;t feel nauseous. Thanks a lot :)

				No, Just smoke a bit of the run and remove the lighter. Hold the smoke as long as you can. The good part of smoking over snorting is it hits within a minute or so so you soon know if you got a decent hit. Also the taste is really fucking stinking at first. Once you&#039;re good and high you won&#039;t mind anymore. Like I say, it&#039;s all trial and error at first. Lying down still can help if you get nauseous but everyone&#039;s different. Some people say a joint is great for the pukes and potentiates the gear but I don&#039;t smoke and nothing makes me puke more than tobacco. One of the things most people find (and actually enjoy) is getting the puke out of the way. I like some nice cold sparkling mineral water (I know, totally hardcore 8)). Just treat it as a bit of an adventure, you&#039;ll be grand

				Hah water is always my choice of drink while using drugs so I&#039;m with you on that one ;)<br />That link you provided was extremely helpful. I&#039;m going to make that contraption that you were mentioning where the tinfoil is taped to the toilet roll tube.<br />Interesting to read that heroin is actually a really clean and safe drug (if you get it off here) as long as you don&#039;t OD or get addicted.<br />I have a feeling if you look after heroin it will look after you.<br />In terms of smoking though would you say heroin #4 is better?

				No mate. I&#039;ve had some good times smoking number 4 but it burns instantaneously and so it&#039;s really really easy to miss the hit. It can be done and the contraption is good for it but it&#039;s so easy to miss. The timing has to be spot on. Get it right though and it will blow the balls off you! Either way, heroin is to be treated with caution. Keep it as a treat or a Friday night unwinder after a hard weeks work and it&#039;s great. Also, know your limits. Like you won&#039;t die but I&#039;ve had some heavy vomiting sessions the next day from smoking too much of the heavy stuff from SR. Some of the gear on here is wild....
