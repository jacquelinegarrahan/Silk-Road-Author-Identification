				Hope to persuade people to buy cigarette filters if they smoke a lot of joints per day, especially Euro smokers who tend to use tobacco with the cannabis or hash or other by products of our favorite herb in the world!<br /><br />I started using filters 5 years or more back. In the UK you can get 3 boxes of 165 filters for Â£1. Most of us use a rolled up filter using whatever is at hand, cigarette packets, the classic Rizla packet, or some buy small strips of ready cut cardboard to roll into filters.<br /><br />I think that for your health it is best to use proper filters in joints. Yes you may lost a little THC but your stopping the shit from cigarettes mainly plus the heat of smoke which can be a health issue.<br /><br />I plan to use a vaporiser once I buy a new one to replace the one I gave away to a buddy with COPD. <br /><br />Tobacco is the real baddy, but as maybe 95% of cannabis smokers use tobacco and a cardboard filter I think this health advice ought to be taken seriously.<br /><br />And you can use a filter on a bong.<br /><br />Hope some listen to this,<br /><br />Takes a day or two to get used to the filter in a joint. I often swap for a fresh filter midway if I leave the joint in the ashtray.<br /><br />Regards to fellow tokers.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve rarely seen people using filters for joints here in the netherlands. Surely the piece of crumpled paper is very popular to prevent inhaling any lose pieces from the weed and tobacco, but filters like those on cigarettes are rarely used. Perhaps they absorb a significant amount of thc - i&#039;m not really sure. <br /><br />Rolling tobacco is pretty popular here though, and you can buy cigarette blanks that come with the filter and paper and just need to be stuffed with tobacco (or cannabis, etc) at very low prices. There is a little device that shapes a pile of tobacco to fit these and insert it as well, also inexpensive. <br /><br />Personally i rarely smoke pot and really do not worry about the tobacco, but for daily users it could certainly be a concern.

				I rarely smoke weed but when I buy the odd quarter ounce (that lasts me millennia)&nbsp; I always filter up, call me strange but I like the minty ones. Oh, and I use my vape too :)

				I assume the filter will not filtrate the actual THC or other cannabinoids, so IMO it is fine to use it and it also tastes better. I mix it with high-quality tobacco.

				Im afraid it would take away alot of the thc:/&nbsp; <br />no problem if you dont mind wasting some tho, just to smoke some more..<br /><br />I used to smoke alot of hash and collect the filters, I only ever use very small filters (just big enough to hold) to avoid wasting any toke to the filters, and never throwing them away.&nbsp; then when low, open them up and theres often some stuck small pieces of hash.. some filters and enough for another nice joint:)&nbsp; also the inside of the filter gets sticky so u can rub tobacco in it that&#039;ll also make u high.<br />i assume a cigarette filter would filter away much more than the cardboard.. surely it would taste horrible to smoke the cigarette filters that would be sticky with thc in them=P<br /><br />best may be to use a little tobacco, or for ease the tip of a cigarette as a filter, altho I wouldnt as u may get tobacco in ur mouth..&nbsp; but then that tobacco would be nice to smoke later=)&nbsp; &nbsp;theres a reason its the end of a joint that is the most powerful, it gets more sticky with oil the more u smoke (tho some of that is prolly tar from the tobacco.., the very end of a joint is best. <br />&nbsp;lil tip i think may be good for poor tokers, be careful when ending the joint.. dont press it into the ashtray/ground, but take the glow of carefully and theres often some hash right behind this glow that was still burning u can pinch off. and if u took the glow of carefully theres usually a little bit of (extra powerful) left- unless u smoke all the way and start burning the cardboard. collect filters with this tiny bit left and just a few of that sticky stuff is good for more<br /><br />very unhealthy tho Im sure..=| hoping to get a vaporizer some day myself, or stop smoking completely and just eat it.. maybe some day^^

Blank cigarettes with filters waiting to be filled and a cheap but clever little plastic Made in China machine. Trouble is that ciagrette tobacco has lots of little sharp bits that tear the blanks! Way around is to crumble up the tobacco a little more, add the hash or finely crumbled bud and the use to make a cigarette that is actually a joint. <br /><br />I actually plan to make these with the Swazi Gold Kief here (swazibudbud888) because the kief has little smell. I smoked this in beer gardens, a festival and in the high street in big cities. Little smell, lovely high. <br /><br />Thanks for the contributions.<br /><br />And rolled up filters do not cool the smoke and let in a LOT of harmful tar which will settle on the throat and lungs. Check the filters after half a joint. That brown stain is what is captured by the filter. Daily smokers are common in the UK. Nothing unusual to see people smoking ten joints a day. Filters are essential as a cardboard filter stops only bits of actual weed/tobacco going into your mouth and throat. Tests have proven smoking a usual joint (Euro style) is like smoking a number of cigarettes. How many differs but less is more.<br /><br />Filters are a harm reduction essential.<br /><br />If cannabis was made legal all joints would have filters.<br /><br />Do you know how hot smoke can get?<br /><br />Filters cool it.<br /><br />Happy toking.<br /><br />Cannot wait to get some Afghan gold seal and kief!

				if your using a bong you might was well get a charcoal filter attachment.. soo awesome especially before all your perc&#039;s keeps your bong SO CLEAN.. <br /><br />and if your a real pot head I&#039;d suggest investing into a vaporizer, I save SO much money on weed and my asthma isn&#039;t effected as much as if I smoke joints.. Right now just chilling at home not working I vape about 2 grams a week.. When I was actually combusting the weed I would go through anywhere from a 1/8 to 1/4 weekly.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing better than getting vaporizer high just completely cheeched with BLOOD RED eyes I mean like my eye&#039;s would look like I had been stabbed in my eyes just SO red.... ahhh I am going to pack a fat bowl now and vape my self to sleep hahaha
