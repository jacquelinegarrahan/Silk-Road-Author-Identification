				hey all, <br />I&#039;m brand new here- I&#039;ve just been browsing the site in complete awe for the past few days. I still have a hard time believing something like this actually exists. I&#039;m a die hard libertarian so this is like porn to me. It gives me hope for the world. The whole bitcoin thing is giving me a headache but it could be worse. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s not why I&#039;m posting. <br /><br />I&#039;m a 20 year old college student I&#039;ve experimented with a variety of drugs, anything relatively safe I could get my hands on (pot, salvia, NO2, mescaline, LSA, shrooms, prescription amphetamines). I&#039;ve had ADHD (or at least been diagnosed with) since I was a kid so i have a prescription for methylphenidate (concerta).&nbsp; I also grow marijuana and mushrooms just as a side note.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading through the postings and I&#039;ve found that many of you seem to be well educated and intelligent people who have their life in order.&nbsp; I guess my question is how do you it ? - I mean balance your drug use with your daily life. I want to experiment with new drugs but i also want to be responsible. I don&#039;t want to jeopardize my relationships with the people I love and I can&#039;t have my g.p.a slip one decimal. Any advice ? <br /><br />Thank you, <br />- Brother Silky <br />

				I&#039;m in college (sort of - grad student) and I manage to balance quite well. And I did in my undergrad too, like the poster above said - it&#039;s all about moderation. (I also had a &#039;normal&#039; job straight out of undergrad that I also managed well while using drugs).<br /><br />Now I&#039;m fairly fortunate. I just do work during the day (with a nice long break in the middle) and just chill and do some drugs at night (usually weed because it&#039;s my favourite =) ). But when I feel like I need a blow out and just want to have a couple of days of unadulterated fun then I clear my schedule, order my drugs, and just go for it. - This works for me because I don&#039;t have much difficulty coming back after a couple of days of hardcore chilling/taking drugs/hanging out/whatever, but I had a friend who found this difficult so he just stuck to evening usage.<br /><br />I mentioned in another post that taking drugs can work to your advantage. You&#039;re generally a lot more creative on drugs, and see things slightly differently, so if I&#039;ve been slogging on something and it appears shit then I take a glance when I&#039;m high or tripping and see other ways to think about it -- this actually worked really great in my undergrad - me and my &#039;druggy&#039; friends (as everyone called us) got the highest marks out of the entire class. <br /><br />I think you&#039;ll be ok, just learn your own limits, and depending on personal preference try and set some limits/rules. i.e. I&#039;ll never &#039;try&#039; Heroin (I was scarred after seeing Black Tar Heroin - has anyone seen this movie??)<br /><br />If you want any other tips you can send me a PM :)<br /><br />PS. Oh, I just thought, if you&#039;re in college I find there&#039;s always one dude who tries to take everything way too far - try and avoid this dude, and try not to become him! :)

				As has been mentioned, priorities and moderation. Bigglesworth nailed a major point, &quot;you need money to pay for your drugs, you need a job to get money, therefore you can&#039;t let drugs fuck your job up.&quot;<br />Try to take some time to pay attention to how the drugs affect you negatively. I try to take a personal note of how I&#039;m affected in the areas of physical performance, physical look to others (sweating, dilated pupils, pacing, drooling, grinding teeth, etc) how quickly I can think on my feet, retention of information, accuracy of thoughts (am I overlooking important info?), attention span, and anything else you feel is important.<br /><br />I have a past history of addiction/substance-abuse, so for new substances I have an approach that tests myself. I will decide whether I want take it slow and really learn the substance and how it works and affects me, or if I want to do it big on a single outing. If taking it slow I make sure to start off with a low dose and wait it out without re-dosing. Based on that experience and my desire to re-dose, I&#039;ll have an idea of whether I&#039;ll be able to continue using it while maintaining the right state of mind in daily life. I&#039;ve learned that if I&#039;m not careful I will continue to convince myself it won&#039;t be/isn&#039;t a problem until it has been a problem and it&#039;s time to play catch-up. After that first experience I will work my way up with preset doses and will continue to not re-dose. When doing it big I make it a single (sometimes two) day experience, and don&#039;t go back to it for a minimum of 1-2 weeks. Just my routine though, ymmv.<br /><br />If you really want to balance drug use and daily life, then I can&#039;t stress the next quote enough.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13637.msg131418#msg131418">Quote from: cuba on February 29, 2012, 01:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13637.msg131322#msg131322">Quote from: microRNA on February 29, 2012, 11:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you are trying to avoid trouble dont use opiates with any frequency.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />or at all. seen to many people go down this road, i remember buying my last oxy and being like okay, time to quit. haven&#039;t gone back since. a dangerous road to go down.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Think about all the people that smoke cigarettes every day who are successful and have balanced lives. They&#039;re addicted to a drug, whether anyone wants to admit it or not. While there are some drugs that can cause you to be too fucked up to go to work or function in society, as long as you&#039;re not a dumbass and know when the right place and time to use them is, you ought to be fine.<br /><br />Just research any drug you intend to use before you use it, find out the estimated&nbsp; time it will take for it&#039;s effects to wear off, find out the recommended and lethal doses, find out what you should have on hand during your trip, et cetera. <br /><br />P.S. Welcome to the Silk Road darling, I hope you enjoy your time here. :)

That made me laugh hysterically for what feels like forever and I just had to acknowledge it! (I&#039;m high as fuck on some of SpanishFly&#039;s weed). Anyway - hilarious! I once worked at a pretty big computer company (i&#039;m too scared to say which, but I SO wish I could because it would make this funnier) and the CEO tried to give a motivational speech because we&#039;re going down the shitter and told us about his son and how he was cured of autism!

				I&#039;d say it&#039;s all about setting limits for yourself.<br />One of my rules is never coke, meth, or heroin (or any opiates).<br />I&#039;m already hooked on cigarettes, so I don&#039;t need any more addictions.<br />Plus &quot;hard&quot; drugs scare me.<br />I&#039;m also a uni student.<br />I smoke weed everyday, not all day, though.<br />My grades are pretty good, but nothing exemplary.<br />I try and use smoking as a reward, a &quot;treat&quot; after my homework is completed, if you will.<br />So just set your limits and stick to them.<br />I have trouble doing this with MXE, however.&nbsp; :P

Reduced government impact on business probably isn&#039;t a good thing these days, just look at how regulation downsizing in the US lead to the GFC.

				No one has mentioned &quot;functioning alcoholics&quot; yet.<br /><br />Some people can literally drink themselves into a retarded stupor every night, yet still get up for work each day and hold down their job just fine.<br /><br />At some point, I must say, though, your grades are probably going to suffer, because unfortunately drugs can often cause people to lose motivation and focus. Perhaps that won&#039;t matter so much in the first couple of years of your undergrad., but consider getting totally clean for your final years, as those grades are usually weighted more.<br /><br />Edit: Ah, the life of the undergrad. college student! How I miss those days! :)

				I&#039;m in my mid 40s, wife and kids and never really did drugs until I found SR.&nbsp; I smoked weed occasionally and would take opiates when I had the opportunity.&nbsp; Did shrooms once.&nbsp; But over the past few months I have to say that I LOVE drugs also.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an addictive personality so I don&#039;t feel like I HAVE to do them but I&#039;ve experimented with a bunch of different things here and just really love being high on various substances.&nbsp; Also, MXE has changed my life from being severely depressed, suicidal, twice hospitalized, panic attacks and the whole works that come from being on the very low end of depression.&nbsp; No joy in life and barely functional and unable to hold a job for the past two years.&nbsp; I actually feel happy with life now.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I love life and have a deep empathy and love for humanity now.&nbsp; <br />I guess I love drugs for more reasons than one.&nbsp; They gave me my life back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry.&nbsp; Sounds like a journal entry and probably corny but eh....what the fuck.&nbsp;

				Blockrockinbeats mentioned functioning alcoholics, I&#039;ve definitely been there before.&nbsp; Not so much that I would call it an addiction for me, I just partied a LOT more than I should have.&nbsp; Managed to go out every night, plow through 20 or so shots.&nbsp; (Not a bad amount, especially given that I&#039;m tiny.) Never had a hangover and still passed all my classes with a 3.5 ...I just got too vain to keep taking in all the calories.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as drugs go, I&#039;m pretty much willing to give everything a go once.&nbsp; Besides krokodil. (I&#039;ll save the flesh eating for the zombie apocalypse.&nbsp; ;) )&nbsp; I just try not to do the same thing too many times in a row, and I hold myself accountable for my other responsibilities.&nbsp; (If I miss something from oversleeping/too much fun I&#039;ll stop for a few weeks.)&nbsp; If it means flushing what I&#039;ve got to avoid temptation, I&#039;ll do it.&nbsp; :&#039;(
