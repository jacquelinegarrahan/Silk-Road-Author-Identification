				Hello, please Flame, :)<br /><br />Do you self medicate with marijuana? I do not publicly condone the use of any substance, in ignorance, to misunderstood medical problems...that being said... as all foods are medicines and the majority&nbsp; medicines come from plants I think it is safe to assume the medicinal effects of marijuana. We are not children, after-all!!!<br /><br />I have friends who self medicate for: Epilepsy, Chrones disease, Athritus and social anxiety. Do you know of any others?<br /><br />I am interested to ask YOU if you think that smoking helps alleviate medical problems...<br />With changing attitudes from criminalisation to medicalisation of drugs; companies will try and capitalise on new legislation...it its important to remember the quality of your medicine....from the oldest medical practice...try... then listen to your body...<br /><br />I just want to ask these simple questions:<br /><br />a.(optional): Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Nationality?<br />1. Whether you have a medical condition that is helped/made worse by smoking weed, What condition?<br />2. How much and what type of weed do you smoke?<br />3. Do you prefer Indica or Sativa? Why?<br />4. How often do you smoke?<br />5. What method do you use to smoke? Pipe, bong, joint or EATING etc!<br />6. Do you mix with tobaccoo?<br />7. Do you smoke in groups or by yourself?<br />8. How did smoking help or have a negative affect on your health?<br />9. If there is anything else you feel important to the discution please summerise here!<br /><br />...if you smoke many types of weed and they have different affects on your health...or if you have multiple medical conditions please specify!! :)<br /><br />....hopefully, if many people respond, this information can better demonstrate the medical and social benefits of smoking weed. And if LOADS of people answer: this poll couple be useful material for the good policy makers of this world!!A!<br /><br />Keep it light-hearted but accurate please. And remember peoples advice about drug use might not always suit you...think for yourself...but keep an ear for those who have walked before you....<br /><br />Have fun,<br />NaturalOils

				From two members of the NaturalOIls Team!<br /><br />Age: Under 35<br />1. I had psychosis (not from weed!!) I had to stop smoking for a few months because it enhanced the trip (in this case not good :P)<br />2. I was smoking mainly indoor grown &#039;skunk&#039; and some pollen/hash<br />3. Indica<br />4. I was smoking a few times per week but not much, now I smoke daily (but not crazy amounts)<br />5. Joint, sometimes chillum, rarely bong or vapourizer (for logistical reasons only)<br />6. Yes<br />7. In groups and by myself...I prefer to be by myself or in creative groups (otherwise laziness affects experience and makes me feel negative)<br />8. When I had psychosis, weed was a very big enemy...but now I smoke only hash and my mind is strong through physical exercise and possitive living. Now smoking makes me eat bettter food, be more thoughful towards the world and live a more wholesome life...such a useful tool.<br />9. I have found that marijuana is a spice for life...it flavours your experince whether that is possitive or negative. I find the most important thing is &#039;SET and Setting&#039; (this is all about your perception of a drug, the enviroment you use it in, the people you use it with, and why you use it; research suggests that &#039;set and setting&#039; has more affect on your psychology and pysiology than the chemicals constituents of the drug...so find a way for the smoke to suit YOU!<br /><br />If I had a choice I would only smoke hand rubbed hash, oil or pure pressed pollen...for me they give the best feeling!<br /><br /><br />Age: Under 35<br />1. Depresion from represion :) I personaly found that I could not enjoy the full potential and gift of weed or hash products when in the environments completely stressed with money making and time management, but most importantly negative PR from those in power!!<br />2. Now I only smoke SuperBall :P Not saying that this is the only thing I enjoy...here in Asia there are many falvours :) But remeber to be high is not the most important thing...what you are high on: is.<br />3. Depends on situation!<br />4. Few joints and chillums per day<br />5. Joints are my favorite, however i do enjoy chillum, for its ability to energize more than a joint.<br />6. Yes<br />7. I do enjoy smoking in groups as well as alone. However I find unpleasant company extremely irritable when high! :P<br />8. To be frank with you...I believe that change of environment and good hash where the key factors, that heleped me to enjoy the gifts of the smoke to the fullest...First of all the quality of the smoke, that does not give headaches or any other side effects :) I find that after smoking good Hash I become more energetic, lively, creative. The major thing that i noticed after smoking SuperBall is that my weight changed...for the better and healthier shape...simple because when smoking SuperBall i find that my body does not enjoy Junk Food, thus my body changes. And all good things started from here, the energy came back, thus I want to do more sports, thus I sleep less...basically you get a chane reaction that implemented the change naturally.<br />9. However do not forget that weed is not the only thing that helps making changes :P It all starts from you and your mind :)<br /><br />What about you?

				Sure, why not. I can help you out. I do not &quot;self medicate,&quot; however. I have a legitimate medical reason and a doctor&#039;s recommendation. Either way, here are my answers:<br /><br />a.(optional): Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Nationality?<br />-20s, Male, caucasion, American<br /><br />1. Whether you have a medical condition that is helped/made worse by smoking weed, What condition?<br />-I have Crohn&#039;s and it helps tremendously.<br /><br />2. How much and what type of weed do you smoke?<br />-It depends. I grow a particular strain that I don&#039;t want to say here (for anonymity reasons), but it&#039;s very good and a sativa. I love indica though, and I get a good oz or so monthly from my dispensary. However, I smoke ounces upon ounces each month. I smoke all day long, daily. I should say vaporize, though. I rarely use my pipe or bong.<br /><br />3. Do you prefer Indica or Sativa? Why?<br />-I don&#039;t prefer either or. I can feel the obvious different effects, but I love all weed (except nasty ass bunk weed. I&#039;ve never even smoked mids before in my life. Not to say I&#039;d turn them down if offered, obviously. Weed is weed, unless it&#039;s total shit).<br /><br />4. How often do you smoke?<br />-Daily. I&#039;m smoking right now.<br /><br />5. What method do you use to smoke? Pipe, bong, joint or EATING etc!<br />-Bong and pipe rarely, mostly my Extreme Q vaporizer (love this thing).<br /><br />6. Do you mix with tobaccoo?<br />-No. I hate tobacco. Nicotine is one of the worst drugs in existence IMHO.<br /><br />7. Do you smoke in groups or by yourself?<br />-By myself. I don&#039;t consider two people a group, and it&#039;s the most I&#039;ve smoked with.<br /><br />8. How did smoking help or have a negative affect on your health?<br />-Helps with the pain in my gut and it relaxes me. I&#039;m always, constantly, high-strung.<br /><br />9. If there is anything else you feel important to the discution please summerise here!<br />-4/20 BLAZE IT FAGGOT.<br /><br /><br />But really, I just love marijuana. It&#039;s one of the most helpful drugs out there. I couldn&#039;t eat without it. The fact that it&#039;s illegal INFURIATES me. Whether or not it&#039;s legal where I live for medicinal use is a complete moot point. Not only would I be using it anyway, everyone else already does. It should be legal everywhere for everyone, just like ibuprofen is.

				a.(optional): Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Nationality?<br />MALE<br />1. Whether you have a medical condition that is helped/made worse by smoking weed, What condition?<br />I have horrible SAD/GAD and PTSD that is helped with smoking marijuana.<br /><br />2. How much and what type of weed do you smoke?<br />1-2g a day is more than enough usually.&nbsp; Just regular bud, haven&#039;t gotten into the concentrates yet really.<br /><br />3. Do you prefer Indica or Sativa? Why?<br />I definitely prefer sativa or a sativa dominant hybrid.&nbsp; Having anxiety and depression,&nbsp; I tend to keep to myself.&nbsp; Indica plants get me too stoned and it creates more anxiety and causes me to close up my self even more.&nbsp; Sativa make me feel free and more open with the laughs, euphoria, and less couch lock.&nbsp; I love how it can create stimulant like effects, crazy plant. Sativa dominant hybrids are also great for relaxing because the strains I like have just enough indica characteristics that go well with the sativa characteristics with out overpowering it.&nbsp; A nice type to unwind at the end of the day or just to chill whether with friends or alone watching a movie.<br /><br />4. How often do you smoke?<br />Haven&#039;t smoked in a while due to my current situation but everyday.<br /><br />5. What method do you use to smoke? Pipe, bong, joint or EATING etc!<br />Pipe, bong, joint.<br /><br />6. Do you mix with tobaccoo?<br />Sometimes I&#039;ll roll a spliff when I&#039;m low.<br /><br />7. Do you smoke in groups or by yourself?<br />Both but mostly by myself.<br /><br />8. How did smoking help or have a negative affect on your health?<br />Definitely used to smoke way to much for a long time.&nbsp; Hate to say but taking huge harsh hits out of a glass spoon wasn&#039;t the healthiest way and all those blunts.&nbsp; Stopped smoking blunts, maybe once in a while with a friend.<br /><br />9. If there is anything else you feel important to the discution please summerise here!<br />I love MaryJane.

				I smoked for about a year then decided that it clouds my thoughts even when not smoking... Not sure if it&#039;s just me but it feels like I was being held back alot.&nbsp; About a month of so of not smoking, I was thinking extremely clearly again.&nbsp; Although I don&#039;t smoke, my friends smoke just about all day every day, which is separating us a bit.

				@iLoveTaffy: Hi dude, thanks for being the first to post...and it seems like smoking really helps you and you can get it on medical; win! I would be interested to hear how you think it helps your condition...is it pain relief, does it help you eat certain foods? etc.<br /><br />@b0lixtrader: Thank-you so much for your honest response. I am fascinated by your case because I have not heard of weed being used to treat PTSD..I heard they were doing trials with MDMA but best to check out the research done by MAPS; rather than believe me :) If you felt comfortable it would be great to hear how smoking can help relive your symptoms of depression. I would also recommend that you try smoking weed/hash that is naturally grown and not grown with chemicals and hydroponics. I have a theory (not founded :P) that the stress created in feminized (no sex) and indoor hydroponically grown weed (batteries of the matrix) can result in stressed alkaloids...I don&#039;t know if this is true but seems logical to me! (scientists get to research :)) NOT TO PUT DOWN ANY ONES GROWING OR WEED EXPERTISE...JUST SOMETHING i HAVE NOTICED FOR MYSELF!<br /><br />@Rastaman Vibration: I know it is a personal question but it is optional as it could reveal information; I put this here so that the people who design social research can use it for accurate, user based experiences with self-medication of Marijuana. It is important to know if women are e.g. 23% more likely to have adverse affects when smoking sativa over indica ( i made this up!!!)...This thread is purely for people to express there relationship with the healing power of weed and for policy makers to see the evidence...I hope it helps and not hinders!<br /><br />@Croskin: Hello, thank-you for taking the time to answer! I love the variety of responses people give and the problem you have is an interesting social issue. If you find that friendship is based on a mental state generated by group smoking this can suck; if you don&#039;t smoke all the time! But I am sure your happy in what you do...I also used to smoke regularly when I was younger with friends and found that smoking was the only ambition...I found myself becoming lazy and had to separate friend groups...I still smoke but do things with people who appreciate my mind, sober or stoned!<br /><br />@Ben: It seems you are a casual smoker...! It does not seem like you self-medicate but do you find that when you smoke you change you character or actions? for example...I love to dance when high!<br /><br />@Miss Sexy Boots: It is interesting that you mention a correlation between over-smoking and paranoia...does this happen on every occasion? have you noticed a connection between indoor chemically grown weed and the onset of paranoia? I am glad that a little smoke helps you with your pain! I hope one day you can access this medicine without fear of persecution!<br /><br />check out Dr. X&#039;s excellent page to ask specific questions...<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.0<br /><br />Keep &#039;em coming,<br />NaturalOils

I never smoke cannabis when i&#039;m in a bad mood since i&#039;ve found that it actually increases your state of mind, no matter if that is positive or negative when you use it. If i am in a negative state of mind (worried etc)&nbsp; i think cannabis would not make that any better but potentially worse, i stay away from it.<br /><br />I grew up with cannabis being widely and cheaply available all of the time in the netherlands though, so i don&#039;t think its anything special at all - it as always been there and probably always will be.
