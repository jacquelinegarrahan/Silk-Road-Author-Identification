				Post by: <strong>dontek</strong> on <strong>June 06, 2013, 01:10 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Reaching out for a little advice and guidance here folks...<br /><br />I have taken mushrooms several times over the years and have always enjoyed the trip that comes along with them, minus of course the stomach being ripped up 15-20 minutes in. My GF has tried shrooms once, but she wound up coughing most of hers across the living room floor and didn&#039;t get that great of a trip. <br /><br />So here I am wanting to have a trippy experience again, and where I find needing guidance. <br /><br />I always stuck with shrooms because of the safety/natureness of them. Used in it&#039;s natural state, know what you&#039;re getting for the most part, etc. And I was close to placing an order for some, but have read many good experiences with LSD, which neither myself nor the GF have ever tried. <br /><br />Which do you prefer and why?<br />And here is the MAIN important question that I have that I can&#039;t seem to find an answer to: Dosage. How much LSD should one get for 2 people? Want to have a good trip with visuals. But with never trying LSD before, I am not sure of the dosage amounts. Also, is there a preferred vendor on here for LSD? <br /><br />Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

				I prefer LSD as it&#039;s easier on the stomach has less of a mind fuck then shrooms and the visuals are goregouse.<br /><br />For a first time time dose I would recommend 150ug maybe 200ug if you are really looking to get out there.

				I know you didn&#039;t ask this but if you&#039;re looking for a natural, novel psychedelic, you should consider mescaline.

				I prefer LSD to psylocibin exactly because of the digestive problems you described. LSD is much more friendly to the digestive system. I would recommend a bit of a lighter dose for your first time, around 100ug. Check the LSD Avengers thread for vendor reviews/recommendations<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270

				Great.&nbsp; Thanks guys. That was a great help. Should have posted this earlier in the week so I could have ordered already and had by this weekend. lol. As far as mescaline, didn&#039;t even think about it. I am a weed guy. And every once in a while I like to trip. But its always been mushrooms and only when they happen to come around, which isn&#039;t often around here.<br />I&#039;ve dabbled in coke and some shitty street h, but that&#039;s rare, and even with SR it&#039;s not something I order. But man, it&#039;s been a looooong time since I tripped. I just want to make sure I am safe in doing it, quantity wise.

				I choose mine based on what I am going to be doing. Or just what I have.<br /><br />If you are having trouble getting sick and digesting I would suggest drinking tea. I get 0 nausea and it is much easier to get down. <br /><br />It&#039;s very simple. First chop up your shrooms or grind them up. Then put them in a pot of simmering water. Do not let the water get too hot because heat downgrades the potency of shrooms. Let them simmer for about 20 minutes or so and then add your teabag, whatever you like. And let simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Strain out the shrooms and enjoy! The come up is much quicker and I never get nausea&#039;s and honestly, it doesn&#039;t taste bad!<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Personally, I find LSD to be a better all-around experience. I enjoy both, but I feel that it is a bit harder to manage heavy tripping on mushrooms as compared to LSD. I am no chemist, but if you read up I think you will find the &#039;natural&#039; argument in favor of mushrooms is actually sort of thin. The active components of LSD are derived from fungus too. <br /><br />At any rate, good luck and happy trails friend.

				Shrooms and LSD are very similar. The differences are exaggerated by people. Remember, both drugs put you into a highly suggestable state of mind. So people associate shrooms with &quot;nature&quot;, and that inevitably colours their experience.<br /><br />Ego death is the same whether you take shrooms or LSD. <br /><br />Also, when people compare shrooms with LSD, they are often comparing LOW POTENCY acid (which is norm) with comparatively high potency shrooms -- so they will say that shrooms are &quot;more visionary&quot; and such. This is sheer nonsense. I have had the most profound visionary type experiences with LSD. <br /><br />Nonetheless, there are some real differences between the two substances.<br /><br />LSD: <br /><br />-- more stimulant-like. more energy. I have to walk around and do things, explore, etc. I feel more adventurous on LSD<br />-- thoughts are more abstract, philosophical<br />-- lasts longer than shrooms.<br />-- more psychoanalytical<br /><br />Shroom <br /><br />-- more relaxing<br />-- feels more physical to me than LSD<br />-- my thoughts tend to be more down to earth compared with LSD. They can be just as wild and original as LSD thoughts, but they tend to be more Gaian in flavour.<br />-- There is a greater impairment of verbal fluency and short-term memory - &#039;confusion&#039;<br />-- more nausea<br />

				to me I&#039;ve always noticed that Mushrooms feel more organic. The &#039;shrooms take me back into a primitive state and make me feel connected to the earth, and all life forms, and the universe and all the planets and make me feel complete unity with everything. The Mushroom experience feels very alien like at times as well. Mushrooms make me realize that we&#039;re all a bunch of fucking apes, everytime! lol

				i did shrooms maybe 9-10 years ago.. so my recollection may not be perfect. i was younger then, and maybe that was why my trip was bad (well that, and the environment was not the best). i did LSD for the first time earlier this year, and i&#039;d have to say that i prefer LSD. i hope to try shrooms some time soon again though.

But in everyday practice, people aren&#039;t being shot up in a blind &quot;taste test&quot;. The experience of consuming each drug creates a lot of the overall &quot;flavor&quot; of a trip. The look of it, the smell, the taste, touch, etc. The old mantra set and setting really holds true.<br /><br />To the OP - neither is my favorite, and neither is better or worse than the other. They have distinctly different &quot;vibes&quot; but to qualify them via text is largely asinine. To understand a substances effects on any meaningful level you just have to take it.
