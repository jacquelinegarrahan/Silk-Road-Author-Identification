				I want to try some hallucinogenics, and heard different opinions.<br />I want something effective, but not too strong. Is 25i-nbome a good choice? 25b? 25c? LSD?<br />Is being at home while tripping a good idea?<br /><br /><br />should I also purchase some valium/xanax/other benzos, just in case I freak out or something?<br /><br /><br />

				2cb I&#039;d suggest, I&#039;m not familiar with a lot of the 25i&#039;s etc. <br />Maybe a mild dose of shrooms. My first was acid and it was awesome. <br />I&#039;m kinda against tripping with benzos as I feel u need to handle whatever the trip throws at you.<br />I think the key is to start small whatever you decide to take.

				Drop a tab of acid on a free day with good company (including an experienced tripped) , good surroundings and a cheeky valium just in case shit gets too crazy for the uninitiated. Even MDMA is a decent starting point into the world of psychedelia - coming to think of it. Shrooms are also a good choice - they are chaotic and disorienting as someone said but generally &#039;light hearted&#039; in nature and the shortest lasting of the big 3 psychs. So in summary... acid.. or shrooms... or even MDMA (not strictly a psychedelic but can be if you have enough!)

				People around here usually recommend you start with weed, then work up to shrooms, then try LSD.<br /><br />If you are still game, try DMT and Ketamine last. I&#039;m told that you should try each individually first, before you try combining them.<br /><br />Please do your homework, and be safe. Happy tripping!

				I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s actually a good, standard &quot;starting psychedelic&quot;. <br /><br />A lot of people ask the question... I think it really depends what you want out of the experience. My first trip was with a high dose of LSD and it was awesome. <br /><br />LSD<br />DMT<br />Shrooms<br />Mescaline<br /><br />Pick one of those and take a sizable dose, you won&#039;t regret it. I really love RCs, but I would advise staying away from anything with unknown safety profiles until you&#039;re more experienced. (The 2c-x family tends to be pretty safe, but some of its analogues (25x, DOx, etc...) are - in my opinion - better saved for later in your psychonautic journeys).<br /><br />That&#039;s just my two cents!

				I guess it would depend on what you are initially trying to get out of the experience. If you&#039;re looking just for a good visual stimulation I&#039;d recommend the 25i compound -- It will be mild at 1mg and intense at 2mg but with a hint of euphoria effect to keep a solid mindset if shit gets weird :) 2C-B is also good for that but I don&#039;t have as much experience with it as the 25i.<br /><br />Shrooms, done at night, have always been a more &quot;gothic&quot; style trip for me if anyone can relate to that, but have a lot more pronounced effect for creative thinking and personal insight. I haven&#039;t done LSD for years but I sure do remember the last time I did...&nbsp; :-X <br /><br />Edit: Pro tips<br />Start small. Its much easier to add more than taketh away.<br />Erowid Erowid Erowid. Knowledge is power. Know what to expect, how to prepare your setting and how the substance is affecting your body and mind.<br />If it becomes intense, concentrate on your breathing and observe your surroundings slowly with curious and scientific speculation; it has a very grounding effect.<br />Talk to yourself&nbsp; :D

				Look into 4-AcO-DMT.<br /><br />It&#039;s one of my absolute favorite chemicals. It&#039;s gentle, profound, fun, overwhelming (in all the good ways), and its an RC so quality usually isn&#039;t an issue. <br /><br />Also known as psilacetin - it&#039;s the acetylated form of psilocin. It&#039;s very reminiscent of a shroom trip, but (in my opinion) has less of the negatives, i.e. body load and anxiety. <br /><br />This is the one that I usually give to people their first time tripping.

				My first hallucinogenic experience was when I was about 21 years old. I had never smoked weed before, and took 1/8 oz. (3.5 grams) of shrooms.<br /><br />It was life changing but I definitely don&#039;t recommend it! I have existing anxiety and I was by myself and it was very scary at first, but got okay and then euphoric towards the 3-4 hour mark. I laid on my bed in my dorm, hugged a pillow and blasted my favorite, familiar music.<br /><br />There&#039;s more details involved, I don&#039;t consider myself stupid, but I didn&#039;t read enough details about the varying onset, and my lack of drug experience didn&#039;t help.<br /><br />SO:<br /><br />I think 2 GRAMS OF SHROOMS would be a great experience to start. Just make sure they are quality and you take them in the right mood and environment. Don&#039;t keep your phone in your hand but know where it is and have someone on duty to call if you need it. I think it takes away from the experience to have someone else there, especially your first time.<br /><br />I agree with people saying DMT should be last, because that for me is the most spiritual, so I don&#039;t take it often. I won&#039;t speak on anything else because I can tell others know more.

				I took one of generalm3sS 2CB capsules for my first trip not so long ago. I don&#039;t have anything to compare it to but I found the experience generally great, it was a little intense in places on the way up so do treat it with respect but otherwise was pretty straight forward.

				Like other have done, I would also recommend 2cb. Yes, Ivory&#039;s is outstanding quality. 2cb is heavy on visuals if you up the dose to 30mg to 40mg, however in my experience, no mindfuck is present.<br /><br />Everything turns different hues in your field of vision and you have a slow-motion reduced frame rate visual effect, all while being in the best of moods.<br /><br />I introduced a couple of psychedelic virglns to 2cb at about 30mg and they reported having the best afterglow from having such a unique experience.

But most psychedelics are fine to try first. Nothing but raw openness to life can prepare you for what taking psychedelics is like. 25-nbome compounds are in my opinion good starting places, and right now are by far the cheapest psychedelic.<br /><br />DMT is the highest quality. LSD, mushrooms, and mescaline are beautiful and will take you farther into your experience as a human being than you ever had an idea was possible.<br /><br />2C compounds are variations on mescaline, and 25-nbome compounds are potent analogs of their respective 2C compounds.<br /><br />Best to be a well-grounded individual and do it with an intelligent friend that you TRUST and have known for a long time.

				25i would definitely be a good starter, or even a low dose of lsd. no need for benzos. just know that everything you are seeing is a result of a chemical reaction in your own brain. accept all your visions and feelings, ESPECIALLY the negative ones. surrender to the power of your own mind, and all will be well.

				LSD should be fine. Start with a low dose and then slowly move your way up. Low dose acid is great, very euphoric and often makes me feel energetic. Around ~125mcg was my first dose and it was truly an awesome experience, wasn&#039;t a mindfuck at all and I could still function just fine.

				MDMA is quite capable of causing some visuals and what I would definitely describe as a psychedelic experience. Especially when combined with a bit of good sativa weed.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t got much into strong sativa weed strains, give that a go. Other than that, my first psych was LSD and it was great. Its really the most well known psychedelic, much more gentle than a lot of people seem to think at low doses, and good fun. That&#039;d be my choice for first.

				My first psychadelic was LSD and it was a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone interested, but make sure you&#039;re prepared to accept what you see. It&#039;s been said before but it&#039;s worth repeating.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also recently tried 2C-I which i found easier on the mind, but tougher on the body (for me anyway.) I&#039;m not saying the above doesn&#039;t apply to this chemical, but it may be something you can investigate if you&#039;re worried about the harsher mental elements of the traditional psychadelics.

				My 2*10^-2<br /><br />Go, as many said, with 2C-B. It is mild and rather pleasant psycodelics.<br /><br />LSD wouldn&#039;t be a bad choice either, it is much like 2C-B, if only hallucination part is tad stronger.<br /><br />I myself would recommend against shrooms, but this is personal - I find shroom trips much more unstable and much easily going bad, than LSD or 2C-B.<br /><br />On another hand - it might be good to try shrooms at least once to know personal reaction to shrooms.

				Shrooms are more earthy there&#039;s less light than acid or mescaline but they are really amazing especially with a bit of good weed. Just start light and you will be right. Get a feeling of the landscape that is the mushroom. <br />I find a small dose of mushrooms(&lt;1g) with a little THC lift to be really fun, great with music or some art making. Make sure that you prep your setting well so that you are not flustered or feeling insecure and it will be fine<br />If you increase the dose the trip is also amazing but can also be very introspective and perhaps point out some things or force you to look at aspects of yourself that you may not be ready for or want to see.<br />Don&#039;t worry that reading others trip reports will influence yours. I&#039;ve read plenty and never had what I consider to be a similar experience. The good thing is they can point out a few things that you might not want to do whilst tripping!:)<br />
