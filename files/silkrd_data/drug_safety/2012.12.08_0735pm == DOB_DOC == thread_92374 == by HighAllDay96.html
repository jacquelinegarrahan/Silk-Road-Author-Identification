				I&#039;d trying searching and looking around but none of them truly answered my question. <br /><br />Can someone please explain the effects of DOB or DOC or both? Preferably someone who has done it themselves? Also, in your answer, could you also please provide for example how much did you take, etc.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />HighAllDay96<br /><br />Luke<br /><br />&nbsp;

				never done DOB, but i took DOC once...it was fuckin awesome, and one of the best days of my life. <br /><br />i took it at midnight and was a little drunk when it was offered to me.&nbsp; soon though, it cut right through the effects of alcohol and i was very awake, and very much tripping.&nbsp; as soon as it started kicking in i had one of the best fucks of my life that lasted at least a couple hours....it had the energy of fucking on amphetamine and the spiritual revelations of sex on acid.<br /><br />after that the girl (not tripping, lol) went to sleep but i was still pumped full of energy.&nbsp; we listened to records and played with the turntables and i could FEEL the sound so precisely...really got into it.&nbsp; i felt like i was in total control of the trip...i&#039;d look at a printout of some fractal art, hold it up to my face and jump right in, making the patterns swirl as i desired or act out little dances and stories.&nbsp; at one point i was looking at the ceiling and thought &quot;i want it to be orange&quot; and it changed just as i wanted.<br /><br />it was a long trip, like 12 hrs.&nbsp; around noon the next day my best friend&#039;s girlfriend woke up and i was like &quot;YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS DRUG!&quot; so we dosed again and had an equally amazing experience.&nbsp; i woke up the nymph who was in my bed and went at it again, just as intensely as the previous night, then proceeded to have a pumped up, fully controllable, wacky daytrip.&nbsp; towards the end i was really hungry and had a wonderful time eating a bunch of weird combinations of food that was in the kitchen.&nbsp; discovered that spanish olives and pepperjack cheese together are great, amongst other things.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know why i never did it again.&nbsp; my friends and i were occasionally throwing raves and i thought it would be the perfect new party drug for the kinda scene we were trying to build.

I know that&#039;s a really vague question but I think you know what I mean. Perhaps just like one of those personal experiences of a drug that people post on Erowid? If you&#039;ve taken it a lot than I&#039;d feel you&#039;d be a pretty reliable source of information on DOC.<br /><br />Joey Terrifying: Thank you for your information. You make it sound like a pretty fun drug to try.

				I took DOB from a vendor on here (think it was mahakala) and it was great. I think I had 2.6mg, all I know was I took two of his tabs and although I was up for a very long time (and at the end I was damn exhausted), it was full of awesome energy and very alive visuals... it was also a bit of a rollercoaster ride emotionally, going from giggly euphoria to somber contemplation and everywhere in between. My favorite moment was when I saw my friend&#039;s face float off his head and project onto the wall. Great fun.<br /><br />I had a friend who had sex on DOC as well. He said he experienced heavy synesthesia during it, very much to his liking. Joey Terrifying gives a decent account of what I assume DOC is like.<br /><br />The DOx are apparently very trippy and very fun. DOM is one of Shulgin&#039;s magical half dozen.
