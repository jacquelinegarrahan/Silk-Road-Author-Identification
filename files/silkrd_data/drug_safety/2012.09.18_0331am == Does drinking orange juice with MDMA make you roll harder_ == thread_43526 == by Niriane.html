				This is quite a persistent &#039;myth&#039;. Some people claim it works, while others say it&#039;s bullcrap. <br />There are studies which show that Vitamin C has a positive effect on the serotonin levels in your brain, which makes you roll &#039;harder&#039; <br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/images/mdma_article3_chart2.gif <br /><br />As you can see on that graph (yes it&#039;s a study on mice.. so what :P ) mice who have been given MDMA with Vitamin C a week earlier, have twice as high serotonin levels when they roll again a week later. This is compared to mice who have gotten MDMA and a saline solution a week earlier.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t know the truth, I guess it&#039;s somewhere in the middle, but there is also this little thingy called PLACEBO which has an tremendous effect on the brain that should not be forgotten.. :) <br />

				orange juice tastes good, but you&#039;ll get better effects from preloading with with 5-HTP and a B-complex vitamin for a few days before you start pillin&#039;.&nbsp; post-loading with the same sort of thing is a good way to get your serotonin back to baseline and stave off suicidal tuesdays.&nbsp; it takes about 12 hours for 5-HTP to cross the blood-brain barrier, though, so taking a bunch of shit at 8pm and dropping your e at midnight isn&#039;t going to do shit except maybe give you an upset stomach.<br /><br />phenylanine is a chemical precursor to dopamine, if i remember right; extra dopamine will also make you roll harder (and part of the mdma experience is a release of dopamine anyway, not just a massive serotonin dump), but when you&#039;re coming down you tend to have an excess supply of dopamine in the brain and very low amounts of serotonin, at which point the dopamine can and will bind to your serotonin receptors and damage them.&nbsp; a low-dose SSRI (paxil, prozac) is actually a good way to attenuate this during a comedown; the SSRI binds to your serotonin receptors instead and prevents the dopamine from fucking shit up.&nbsp; yes, that&#039;s a technical term.

				It actually makes you roll harder at a shorter time because vitamin c is suppose to help with your brain after some mdma.

				I think this story originates from drinking the juice of grapefruits rather then oranges.<br /><br />Grapefruits do contain substances that will load the cyp34A metabolic pathway. This causes consuming grapefruit to inhibit the breakdown of a whole array of substances, ranging from illicit drugs to prescribed cholesterol-reducing medications. <br /><br />Note that this effect is only present in grapefruit though, not in oranges.

				I just always assumed this stemmed from the ol&#039; LSD - OJ myth.<br /><br /><br />Not sure of any science to that one either. I just always thought LSD = Acid. OJ = Acid (citric)<br /><br />..... I have done both with and with out and cant say it was noticeable either way.<br />

				Maybe we are talking about 2 different things then.. I hadn&#039;t heard of the grapefruit thing. <br /><br />Where vitamin C helps is that it is an effective anti-oxidant. MDMA clogs up the receptors so serotonin uptake can&#039;t occur. This floods the brain with excess serotonin and the receptors all stay full, which feels great. But some of the serotonin that isn&#039;t being used starts to expire causing free radicals and toxicity in the brain. This is what vitamin C clears up, which stops you from doing more damage and makes the come down much more gentle. <br /><br />If you have any info on the grapefruit thing let us know Ben!

				It&#039;s not about vitamin C, and grapefruits are not identical to oranges in this respect.<br /><br />The concept of grapefruit (juice) altering the effect of certain medications is not some folk story, leaflets that come with a number of prescription meds (particularly against cholesterol and such) mention grapefruit specifically as something that should no be consumed when taking the medication. <br /><br />Illicit drugs also rely on the same pathways however, which explains why combining grapefruit with mdma is not a good idea, but washing them down with orange juice is perfectly fine.
