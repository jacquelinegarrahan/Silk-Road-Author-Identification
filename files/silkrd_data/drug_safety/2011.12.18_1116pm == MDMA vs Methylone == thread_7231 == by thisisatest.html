				Never have MDMA or Methylone before and have noticed the two are supposed to have similar effects yet Methylone is significantly cheaper...<br /><br />Wondering what the community thinks about the differences in effects, if it is worth it to spend the extra on true MDMA (for a first time user), and why the price difference if they are so similar?

				in my experiences, methylone is much milder and of shorter duration than MDMA. If you google about this, you will find many sources discussing their differences.<br /><br />However, some vendors will claim that their methylone is nearly indistinguishable from MDMA but i have not had this effect in my own experiences.<br /><br />If you have the money, then i don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t go straight for MDMA. But if you&#039;re short on cash, methylone would be a suitable substitute for a first timer.

				Methylone seems so much more clear-headed and eloquent than MDMA for me.<br /><br />M1 is so theraputic.. get your friends together, give everybody 160mg plus a 140mg booster at +1:30, and you will have a wonderful bonding experience. <br /><br />MDMA seems a little less clear - more visual and sensory effect. <br /><br />I enjoy a combo of the two as well (lower doses, say 100mg M1 + 100mg MDMA)

				Methylone is kinda like a watered down version of mdma. You can &#039;roll&#039; off it but you need a dose of about 300mg to get the same serotonin effects of 100mg of mdma, while tripling the dopamine effects which make you wayyy cracked out. I mean like chewing on ur lips, talking super fast, sweating load, tremors, nervousness/anxiety/paranoia, difficulty sleeping, etc, whereas if you just took 100mg of mdma, you would feel just as good without all the negative side effects. Also methylone just has something missing, you dont feel as downright happy and blissful, its just kinda like a new, clearer sober whereas mdma is an intense awesome experience. The peak and most sought after effects of methylone (the &quot;roll&quot;) is very brief, only lasting like 45 minutes to and hour and a half, and even this peak doesn&#039;t touch what mdma could do to you, and the peak of mdma last at least 3 hours for me. If i were you i&#039;d go with mdma for your first roll, it&#039;ll be wayyy more worth it. god i wish i coulda had access to some pure mdma for my first roll. :D

				I personally like methylone more. I don&#039;t get some weird effects from M1 that I get from MDMA, like shivers and yawns. I&#039;d say 100 mg of MDMA = 250 mg of M1, so they are nearly similar in value. Both last about 4 good hours, M1 probably doesn&#039;t last quite as long. I tried methylone first, ate 500 mg, and rolled the best roll in my life. I was wobbling so hard... Good times! Hope that helped!<br /><br />-RI

Taking it in a pill feels like a roll, snorting feels like &quot;Happy Coke&quot;, and smoking it is just unreasonably great. I haven&#039;t smoked it in a while...but it gets you high as fuck.<br /><br />Also Methylone has almost no comedown. Heck I took a shit load of methylone for a show and I had a final and studied right after the show coming off the methylone and got a FUCKING 98! The highest grade in the class. Simply fucking amazing!

You can&#039;t do MDMA that often. Methylone is like a toned down version of MDMA for when you don&#039;t want to roll full on. Its great for a casual house party and it does make you roll pretty hard. Everyone in my town absolutely loves methylone. <br /><br />Methylone is like coke with a nice easy roll. Methylone &gt; Coke&nbsp; MDMA &gt; Methylone<br /><br />Methylone also has pretty much no comedown. Methylone has pretty much overtaken coke in all situations in my town. Coke is pretty much irrelevant now and no one wants coke now that methylone is so readily available (wholly because of me). <br /><br />I always tell people that its like the greatest coke ever with a little bit of a roll.

				hey bro. i cant comment on the methylone, but MDMA is king for sure. i think i will try some methylone some time in the future just to see what all the fuss is about. im sure it wont be as intense as the MDxx, but it sounds like it something i could do more often an not worry about depleting all my serotonin and not having come down like you get from MDMA. but yeah, i would highly doubt that methylone is as fun as MDMA. so i suggest MDMA in the end. you will have a better time on MDMA for sure bro, like everyone else has said. so methylone for small kick backs an just hanging out with friends an stuff an MDMA for the full on ragers. oh an like everyone else says, dont do MDMA more that a couple times a month. if you do it too often it loses its magic. as for coke, its just a complete waste of money imho. instead of coke, try the methylone as a sub for coke. cause coke only lasts for about half an hour an is very morish an horrible come down, the worste imho. well, be safe and have fun bro.

I dont get any physical side effects from mdma other than very minor jaw tension, and I don&#039;t fiend for more when I&#039;m coming down. <br /><br />With methylone I&#039;m a fucking wreck every time i do it. Totally cracked out, lips smackin&#039;, teeth grinding, talking a mile a minute, burning up and sweating fucking buckets all night long its horrible I&#039;ll wake up the next morning in a puddle of sweat - yuck! <br /><br />Oh yeah it dehydrates the hell out of me, I&#039;d drink a gallon of water at least every time and piss every 20 minutes which isn&#039;t fun cause if ur lucky enough to go to sleep you&#039;re gonna wake up every hour to take another piss and wipe sweat off ur face. <br /><br />Also always couldnt eat a damn thing, or get a boner, major vasoconstriction and weird heart problems, like scary shit like feeling ur arteries in ur neck pump and double beats and skipped beats. Also m1 puts my heart rate and blood pressure thru the roof. m1 also gives me anxiety and makes me paranoid on the comedown and since 90% of the time ur gonna have to redose it you&#039;ll probably have scary stimulant effects like shadow people and shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />soo... you&#039;re saying go with the methylone???<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:P

				Go for MDMA.<br />GO FOR MDMA.<br /><br />go for mdma.<br /><br />SO much more euphoria, longer duration, more love. More tactile shit. Methylone is like, closer to MDMA than any other stim (imo) but still miles off.

				In my experience, when I took Methylone I felt energetic and talkative at times while introspective and quiet at other times. Emotionally, I felt content yet anxious. I was disappointed that music didn&#039;t sound intriguing and I didn&#039;t have any desire to dance. All of my preexisting self consciousness was still lingering in the background. After it wore off, I felt depressed and almost flu-like. I also had a slight headache.<br /><br />The best thing to come out of the high was that I had a deep conversation, but I don&#039;t think that either of us really knew what we were talking about. It was happening a mile a minute.<br /><br />When I took MDMA it was amazing. I felt open to other people emotionally in a way that I never have felt before. All of my usual feelings of self consciousness were gone. I also had a great time dancing.<br /><br />The down side is that I probably looked weird to the average person. I think that I also experienced short term memory loss. The next day my vision was blurry and my muscles ached badly from dancing. I also had a weird sense of vertigo which eventually wore off. I still felt the peaceful glow even the next morning, and I don&#039;t remember crashing that badly.<br /><br />Your experience will vary, of course.

				I&#039;ve done MDMA/XTC pills quite a few times (15 times or so over a course of 4 years) and it&#039;s imo the most amazing drug around.

				Tried it a couple of days ago and I&#039;m not really convinced, although I didn&#039;t have the change to really indulge in it as I had some work to do the next day. Ended up taking about 160mg and 7 beers. It really felt like a watered-down version of MDMA and not at all like coke. I don&#039;t even get how it would compare. I got some left and gonna try a bigger dose next time (and possibly a redose) and see how that works.
