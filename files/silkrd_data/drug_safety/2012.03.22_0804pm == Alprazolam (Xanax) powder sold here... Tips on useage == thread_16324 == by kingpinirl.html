				Hey guys-<br />I&#039;m writing to get some info on the xanax powder floating around on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m a VERY moderate user.&nbsp; I take 0.5mg and it relaxes the hell out of me.&nbsp; I do this once or twice per week, no more, and I have no interest in doing any more.<br /><br />For me, a 250mg bag of this powder would last years - and I think it would be a really good investment to make.<br /><br />However - how the hell am I supposed to weigh out .5mg?&nbsp; <br /><br />My questions...<br /><br />How big is a bag of this stuff (let&#039;s compare against cocaine -something I&#039;m a bit too familiar with)?<br /><br />Is it possible to just grab a tiny crumb and eat - safely - I&#039;m talking a miniscule amount, tiny tiny tiny - or is that tiny amount going to be 3mg?<br /><br />If I have to dilute it - it&#039;s not going to be worth it to me.&nbsp; I would be willing to invest in a mg scale, but are there any out there that will do half a mg that aren&#039;t 10k?

				I think you&#039;ll have to go with a mg scale. They can be picked up relatively cheap, just do a search. Think of it as an investment anyway. I know I&#039;d be fucked without mine

				Even a mg scale is usually +/-3mg. You would wanna weigh out at least 10mg and eyeball&nbsp; it after that... still not very safe at all in my opinion.<br />I&#039;d say get a liter of Everclear, dissolve the 250mg, and you will have 1mg/4milliliters. Might wanna invest in a 10ml beaker or syringe something for measuring the liquid. Throw some food coloring in the bottle too so it doesn&#039;t get accidentally drank and kill somebody.<br /><br />Also, have you tried lorazepam?<br /><br />Happy travels!

				Please stay away from Xanax powder. Last year at least 10 people&#039;s lives were ruined because of Xanax Smarties and Xanax Powder.<br /><br />Just make sure you are responsible or you will end up in a ditch lol.

				To those who find it safer (myself included) to volumetrically dose, this equation will tell you how much everclear to add for whatever dose per drop (50µl = 0.05ml) you desire and given the mass you are adding.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a ratio, the basic concentration one you&#039;d use when making up solutions (almost)<br />[Total Mass of Product] = [Desired Dose]<br />[How Much to Add]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Drop, 50µl]<br /><br />There are division lines under both total mass of product and desired dose i just dunno how to format it lol<br /><br />Here&#039;s an example of what I mean:<br />[250mg] = [2mg]<br />[xml]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[0.05ml]<br /><br />Solve for x (so 250mg x 0.05ml = 12.5 and then divide by 2mg = 6.25mL)<br /><br />Everyone is right, be ultra careful, get a graduated cylinder and know how to read the meniscus correctly.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to explain that math on this forum, on paper it would look so simple to you haha, just put division lines and pay attention to how the units are crossing out to understand.<br /><br />Please be safe like I HOPE to myself !

				Is the xanax powder really pure? I was under the impression that for the most part it was cut. I&#039;ve worked my way up to 9mg with the powder I have, so far, and still have not felt any effects. =/

				I got mine earlier today, and I have had no problems with potency at all. I&#039;m starting to think maybe the weather has something to do with it? Anyone who got it knows what state it was shipped from (USA stock), and I literally live one state over. I know my stuff was not in transit nearly as long as some of you others. I&#039;m not sure why some people have had no problems (like me) and others have had virtually no effect. The feedback for the actual product reflects that it is indeed real deal stuff. It would be an awful lot of work to set up shop in US to sell such seemingly small amounts of product for a seemingly small amount of profit. If that was googleyed&#039;s intention, why not just scam someone once for a bulk amount (which someone here would jump on) and have just one negative feedback from it? There are just so many things that do not make sense.
