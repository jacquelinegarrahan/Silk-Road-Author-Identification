				What exactly is your digestion problem? I always use stool softener. If that&#039;s what you mean.

				Drink lots of water, exercize, fruit.&nbsp; IF that doesn&#039;t work I&#039;d get some Miralax, as it&#039;s tasteless and fairly easy to get down.&nbsp; Also, could try docusate.&nbsp; Heroin is actually not near as bad as methadone, for these kinds of problems.&nbsp; I&quot;d could go on for pages about the misery that goes along with this, but it won&#039;t do any good.&nbsp; Heroin is short acting, don&#039;t do it late at night, and wait until you have a bowel movement in the morning before fixing.<br /><br />Worse come to worse, go back to drugstore, by an enema bag, it&#039;s usually in the &#039;women products&#039; ara, and is red with a long plastic hose.&nbsp; Make some coffee, then let it cool off, pour it in the bag and fill up with water.&nbsp; AFter giving yourself enema, don&#039;t go to bathroom for about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; This is not as easy as it sounds.&nbsp; <br /><br />Go to opiophile.org.&nbsp; This has been written about extensively.&nbsp;

				What Phubaiblues said.<br /><br />If constipation is your problem, never let yourself go more than a couple of days without a good bowel movement.&nbsp; Pick up some senna-s tablets from the drugstore (laxative and stool softener) and take a few every day or so for a few days so you don&#039;t get blocked up.<br /><br />When I was younger, and doing things like T3&#039;s and percs, it never occurred to me that it was causing a problem.&nbsp; I can remember a few times I thought I was going to die it was so bad.&nbsp; Felt like passing a 2x4.&nbsp; Once I figured out what the problem was, I never let more than a few days go by without something happening ever again. <br />
