				Well, soon will be my first roll for 10 years so I want to make it count, but I&#039;m a little nervous about how strong this stuff will be as I&#039;m sure 90% of the stuff I&#039;ve ever had was pretty dodgy.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if&nbsp; I should pop my cherry testing a smaller amount during the day by myself next time I get a day off, or just wait for the next rave/club event and go medium-well done like I like my steak. Watching youtube videos of people totally wasted on X has made me slightly less gung-ho about how much to take, although I&#039;m sure if the people in the funny videos could have spoken they would have told you they were having fun. I&#039;d like to be able to talk to people because for me that is a large part of the fun of molly. My usual disdain for the average person goes out the window. Until it wears off, that is. :-)<br /><br />If I do a tester first, it will be a small dose maybe 75mg just to roll for maybe 4 hours enjoying music at home, maybe go for a walk or something, as I want to be normal/baseline by the afternoon.<br /><br />For the event, I think I&#039;ll go 100mg, then 50mg top-up an hour later if I&#039;m feeling confident.<br /><br />I&#039;ll prob end up having it with two friends, one significantly heavier than I am and one a bit lighter. I&#039;m an average-sized guy. You reckon 100mg each for them? One of them has had it a couple of times before, the bigger guy has never had it before, but has a low reaction to coke (said he did 5x what his friends were going crazy on, and just got a numb nose), if that makes a difference to anything. He goes pretty hard with everything he does, maybe he&#039;ll want more.<br /><br />Does all this sound ok to all you experts??

				Dont be nervous man, I&#039;m in the same boat haven&#039;t rolled for nearly 7 years but I used to get onto good pills.&nbsp; Are you dropping it orally?&nbsp; just keep yourself busy for the first 30mins instead of being nervous and sitting round waiting for it to kick in, thats my only tip<br /><br />I&#039;m going to start at 125mg, but in a home setting with some good friends, good music and not the intensity of a massive crowd event lol<br /><br />I&#039;m more worried about doses for others for how cheap it is I wanna spread the love to some people at a party coming up next month for free and to pay some people back for the things they&#039;ve done for me over the years as a surprise, but don&#039;t want to fuck people up so maybe make 100mg caps to be safe

				Your dosing sounds right to me ;) Have fun, don&#039;t be nervous cause it can fuck a lot of things up. <br /><br />After all, there&#039;s nothing to be nervous about right? The feeling is awesome :D

				I just had my first roll in about ten years, and a 100mg dose of Ivory&#039;s gear was a perfect reminder of why I loved MDMA. I&#039;ll probably go for 125mg with a booster next time, but 100mg seemed like a perfect dose for my return. Not too strong, and definitely not too weak. Then again, I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot;, 150lbs (1.78 meters, 63kg/10.7 stone), and take 1mg of clonazepam twice per day (I took my first dose early and my second dose right before bed that day, not sure if that mattered).<br /><br />One other thing I forgot was how much self-control it takes to wait a full month when you have a beautiful bag of crystals in your possession. :)

				I think it really depends on how intense you want your roll to be. Sure, you can roll from 100mg if you have no tolerance, but it won&#039;t be an &#039;intense&#039; roll.<br /><br />Please remember that street pills are cut with all sorts of shit... I remember pills that were very stimulating because they were cut with speed/meth. MDMA itself is relaxing, but not in the same way as a depressant. MDMA is a class of its own - it has magic that no other drug has. The sense of peace and forgiveness you feel towards the world is insane. You&#039;ll find yourself thinking about all the people in your life and truly understanding them. It&#039;s a life changing experience if used for the RIGHT reason. Don&#039;t use MDMA to get a quick &#039;buzz&#039; - fuck it does uplift your mood but so do a lot of other drugs. It&#039;s MDMA&#039;s own unique properties that make it &#039;magical&#039;. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to have a bad experience with MDMA - anxiety? Hell no! It takes all your feelings of anxiety and pain and lets you focus on what truly matters rather than what we ourselves think matter.<br /><br />I&#039;d highly suggest a starting dose of 140mgs if you&#039;re feeling nervous - The &#039;rush&#039; so to speak can be intense... after a while though you begin to enjoy a good rush. <br /><br />Also, re-dose when you&#039;re at the peak! It extends it by about an hour, 40mgs is enough as a &#039;booster&#039; dose.<br /><br /><br />Sollem

				Fuck your funny Ozzbattla first thread your freakin out if your order would arrive safe, now you wanna know how much to take and on another thread your askin where the best place to stick it is funny as. I would go for 100mg caps even for your 1st try cos you know if you do less you will be just enjoyin it but also thinkin gee I wish I had just taken that little extra. When you go out bang a 100mg cap then have some half point caps I rekon you would want to top up with 100mg&#039;s again but if you have 50mg caps you have the choice of topping up with just 1,2 or3 hmmm maybe 4 yum yum. Just remember if you put it in capsules keep them in a baggy and a small container cos those capsules sometimes suck up moisture if your in a sweaty club and you don&#039;t want to think your just goin to have another cap and find a soggy mess in the bag. ENJOY I&#039;m jealous I want 10grams of NL MDMA :o

Don&#039;t want to end up sucking a sweaty pants pocket.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />As nervous as I was about picking up the mail, I&#039;ll be double as nervous going into a club or even out in public with a bag of pills. I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;ll do about the redosing, I&#039;m pretty nervous about LE. Maybe when I&#039;m rolling I&#039;ll be less nervous. I was thinking if I go to an outdoor-type event, I might dissolve the stuff in water or coke, and take a water bottle or coke bottle in. I forget if they let you take water bottles into an event. I&#039;ll have to find out.

				My first order from Sr a few months ago was for a gram of mdma. I was in the same situation as you. I hadnt taken it in over 10 years. I dumped out the gram and split it into 10 equal piles and proceeded to cap one of 100mg doses. I scooped up enough to fill about half the capsule and put the rest of that pile back into the bag. I was a little worried not knowing what my tolerance was, and boy am i glad i didnt put the whole 100mg in the capsule. I was fucked up and it was intense. <br /><br />In my old age ive learned to start small and work my way up to larger doses. Dont forget you can always take more but you cant take back a dose once its kicks in. You have no idea how strong its gonna be until it hits you. Be safe and have fun. Peace.

Or maybe all these pill-heads on the forums just have huge tolerances. I don&#039;t want to pop my 10 year cherry with a mild roll where I wish I took more, and from what I read, redosing won&#039;t help much if I wait too long after the initial dose.<br /><br />But yeah, you are right and I know I need to be careful.

				It was more like 75 mg, but honestly i was dumb for not using a scale because the gram could have been overweight. Whatever the amount was i was fucking wrecked. Eye wiggles, cevs, oevs, done. I puked a few times throughout the trip too and im glad i was at home because i was able to just chill and mellow out. <br /><br />Everyones different though, just figured id offer some advice from my perspective.

				Huh? My name actually is Joeyjojojr.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;JK, lol. <br /><br />It kicked in at almost exactly a half hour and came on really strong. I was nervous a little because it was my first order and i guess the whole idea of the anonymity and the fact that it could have been some crazy rc or poison or some shit started to bug me out. I ran to the bathroom because I had to puke and once i puked it got even stronger. I didnt do any research except going by what the vendor told me and his/her feedback. It tasted similar to what i remember mdma used to taste like, but it didnt have that sassafras bitterness that you once you try you will never forget.&nbsp; I did not test it with a marquis or any test beside taste. I had to calm myself down and just went with it and once i calmed down it was cool, but i ended up throwing up again about 2 hours in which was weird. The shit hit hard for a good solid four hours then slowly came down gradually decreasing over the last 2-3 hours, but i had a pretty bad hangover and didnt feel 100% for close to 24 hours. All in all it was about 7-8 hours total with a drawn out come down. That night I had trouble sleeping, waking up every hour or so, and had no appetite for the whole next day.<br /><br />Im no spring chicken and have been through a lot of stress and issues in my life since the good old days of my youth when i could go days without sleep and live off of mdma. I took it a few times after this night and had good trips, but im glad i didnt take anymore that first night because I was beyond fucked up. Everyone is different, and i definitely made some mistakes by not testing the product, and by not using a scale, but it was a wild trip and i made it our alive, so lol. <br /><br />

				If you are taking any kind of pill I would recommend taking only one to start out.<br /><br />If you taking pure mdma then I&#039;d dose somewhere between 100 and 150 mgs. You can always re dose if you find it necessary [most people re dose molly with a small bump].

				@op depends on the quality and everyone has different reactions to dosages<br /><br />1.5 mg mdma per 1kg body weight is a good dosage if you haven&#039;t used a serotonin releasing drug for a while. See how it goes from there, you can only roll so hard until you reach your ceiling, all you will do then after that point is risk brain injury
