				Hey,<br /><br />I went on a bit of a benzo bender, and I have a question about withdrawals. <br /><br />I had been taking between 1-3 mgs of alprazolam a day for only 10 days. Stopped taking benzo&#039;s last friday. Also had been taking oxy&#039;s for about 6 days, ~20-30 mgs a day.<br />I quit taking the xanax on Friday, realizing I had my fun with it and needed to be done. On Saturday I took a pretty ludicrous amount of oxy and chamomile, attempting to ease the mild benzo withdrawal. Saturday night I realized this wasn&#039;t helping anything and stopped taking the oxy. Needless to say, Sunday was spent in bed sleeping, feeling generally horrible, slightly paranoid, and really sick. The sickness has faded considerably, but the symptoms have shifted a bit. <br /><br />Today its Tuesday night and I&#039;m definitely still sick. Only I have a fever, I&#039;m tired, I have a headache, and I feel like I can&#039;t think. Symptoms mimic a standard head cold, and I don&#039;t really feel like I&#039;m withdrawing, I feel like I&#039;m sick. It doesn&#039;t feel like any sort of familiar withdrawal, but I&#039;ve never been through benzo wds so I can&#039;t comment. <br /><br />Could I possibly still be going through benzo withdrawal 4 days later after only a 10 day binge? Or did I contract a cold and am actually sick? <br />If I&#039;m still wding, then holy christ these buggers hit you hard and fast. Never taking benzo&#039;s for more than a day again.

				Its more likely that the oxy has its claws in you.&nbsp; If you take that much oxy for 6 days straight your body is gonna want it.&nbsp; You are most likely experiencing a mild withdrawal from the benzo (easier to beat) and more pronounced one from the oxy.&nbsp; You could also be sick on top of it too though :)

I had important shit to do on monday so I popped a 7.5/325 vicodin and could feel its effects loud and clear, but was still quite sick on top of the opiate feeling. It didn&#039;t ease the sickness at all.<br />After that failed I took a quarter mil of Xanax and didn&#039;t feel less sick, but couldn&#039;t feel the xan at all either. Which lends me to believe that my tolerance for xan is higher than for opiates at the moment, and its the xan that&#039;s responsible. A quarter mil is pretty tiny considering the dosages I&#039;ve been taking, and if I had the xanax withdrawals out of my system, you think I&#039;d feel it, right? Or at least feel a tad less sick.<br />Fucking hate drugs sometimes, I have shit to do dammit. I though this would be gone by the weekend.<br />I can tell just by the rate that this is progressing that I&#039;m still going to be sick on Wednesday.

				hmm, dunno, I don&#039;t think benzo withdrawal is that pronounced though.&nbsp; I take benzos everyday (have for years) almost but I can go a few days without and side effects are generally just more stress, inability to sleep that sort of thing.&nbsp; Opiate withdrawal can be pretty aweful though and does include body aches and pains, naseau.&nbsp; Not sure you would have that degree of withdrawal after 6 days though unless you have used more regularly in the past.<br /><br />I&#039;m certainly not an expert.&nbsp; Just drink lots of fluids and try to taper off slowly on everything,&nbsp; you could have a low grade flu or w/e and the other stuff just compounds it.<br /><br />Hang in there, hope you feel better.&nbsp;

				Just an update. Its Wednesday night and I am feeling quite a bit better. Still not 100%, but its not affecting my life very strongly anymore.<br /><br />I do believe it was the benzo&#039;s that were responsible. I had no diarrhea, in fact my digestive system was working swimmingly, and my symptoms were more aligned with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Also, I have been through opiate withdrawal before, and it was never quite like this. This felt more like a strong hangover. Also, I&#039;ve noticed in the past that I&#039;m far more prone to alcohol hangovers than most of my friends, and am rather unreceptive to minor opiate withdrawal. While I don&#039;t know enough about neuroscience to solidify this, I believe that my individual brain chemistry makes me more sensitive to GABA agonist withdrawal than most. In the long run, likely for the better.<br /><br />Tommygun, be careful with your benzodiazepines. Google it once, full-blown benzo withdrawal sounds absolutely horrible. While obviously it depends on habit and individual brain chemistry, I do believe strong benzo wd&#039;s are generally worse than opiate withdrawal.

				yeah I hear yah, I&#039;m probably too far down the path in my life to not take them and they help me balance my stress.&nbsp; I take a relatively small amount (1mg) though and never have increased over the years however.
