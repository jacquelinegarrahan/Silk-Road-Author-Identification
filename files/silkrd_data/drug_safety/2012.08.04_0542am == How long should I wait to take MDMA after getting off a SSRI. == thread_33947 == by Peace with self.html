				Title says most of it, but I&#039;m on Paxil 40mg&#039;s once a day. Just wondering if I should wait a couple months or if I could just wait a couple days and be good to go. Thanks for anyone that tries to help.

				Depends on half-life of antidepressant you are using. Paxil have very low half-life - i&#039;m not a doctor, but i believe 2-3 days would be enough, and i waited this time myself before using psychedelics when i was using paxil, and i noted no weaken of their effect. I also used tramadol and got no seizures, and when i was on Prozac and took tramadol in 1.5 week after stopping prozac i got serious seizure (and almost fallen on the path of coming train), because this SSRI antidepressant was still active. Prozac have long half-life, and you should wait 2-3 weeks, maybe more If prozac is used for many months, before consuming substances incompatible with SSRI.

My knowledge about the workings of SSRI is not the most profound, but I have stated this in the DMT-thread and a ssri-user agreed on my findings here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33427.msg383284#msg383284 <br /><br />in a nutshell: SSRIs take over the Serotonin management in your brain. It takes a couple of weeks for it to be fully established and it&#039;s said to take up to 3-6 months for your brain to fully recover (I read on bluelight that for very longterm SSRI users MDMA might never work again :( unconfirmed tho). <br /><br />Your mileage may vary.&nbsp; So no one can really say. You can always try, but my guess is it will take at least one month.

				How long is very longterm? I&#039;ve was on Celexa for 2 and a half years 20mg&#039;s for 2, 30mg&#039;s for a month and 40mg&#039;s for the last 5 months, then I got switched to Paxil 40mg&#039;s a day. I really hope MDMA works because if it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m going to be insanely depressed, I loved MDMA so much.

I guess the SSRIs could have left some permanent &#039;damage&#039; to your brain by then. I&#039;ll try to find the thread but there were not many details. <br />And there won&#039;t be any studies either (doubt the pharma-industry would let anything like that get public).<br /><br />With your history I&#039;d expect something like 3-6 months. But there is not much info on this, especially nothing scientific. A friend of mine was on Venlafaxine/Effexor for almost 2 years and we tried to roll at the 3 months mark and it was way stronger for me than for him. But Venlafaxine is a phenylethylamine, like the amphetamines, so this could play a role also.
