				I can offer you consultation on DMT production for some BTC. I&#039;ve sold over half a kilo of some of the best DMT this website has seen.&nbsp; :)

				Buddha is the man if you want to cook some DMT! If you are looking to start producing, I think that&#039;s a good starting point as it was a pretty easy extraction. If you can&#039;t get Mimosa bark online in your country, then if doing it from scratch is even close to the difficulty of extraction it is still a good start. <br /><br />But yeah, go with the Buddha if that&#039;s what you&#039;re going for. Good luck!

				Just gonna interject one more time. Be very careful about that kind of deal (both parties, of course). BtC through SR is the safest method of exchanging anything (as safe as we&#039;re getting). A moneypak is opening up dangers to both parties.<br /><br />Getting small amounts of BtC isn&#039;t very hard. There&#039;s plenty of walkthroughs. I got 20 dollars worth of BtC in about 2 hours into SR my first try.<br /><br />Cheers

				You can always get some BtC through mtgox via bitinstant (which you can go to many places stateside for cash deposits). Many people warn against mtgox and they&#039;re a pain in the ass but I haven&#039;t heard of any good alternative bitcoin sites.

I just want to re-iterate this to you, again not because I think you are LE specifically, but because this sort of talk could make others think you are. Just be careful.

				Extracting DMT from mimosa hostilis is so easy that it makes me wonder how the stuff has any street value at all..... I&#039;m really not sure how you managed to not find any info on this, it&#039;s gotta be the most common home-extraction.<br /><br />Check out the DMT Nexus and the STB Teks.<br /><br />

				I think being able to follow step by step instructions, which getting bitcoins involves, is a skill required for all basic and advanced chemistry...

Most of the guides out there will get you yellow or orange stuff that burns your lungs badly. Like I said before I&#039;ve pulled over 500g of DMT so I&#039;ve been able to try out the different recipes and make that works better than the others. The guide I posted works pretty well but I&#039;m not a great writer so it might be hard to follow the first few times. Hit me up for some consultation if you need help.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39293.msg439228#msg439228">Quote from: jpsmfb on August 29, 2012, 08:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think being able to follow step by step instructions, which getting bitcoins involves, is a skill required for all basic and advanced chemistry...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Definitely... If you&#039;re hesitant to follow simple guides to get bitcoins through bitinstant, how can you be willing to perform a chemical process which could get you injured badly if you&#039;re not careful?
