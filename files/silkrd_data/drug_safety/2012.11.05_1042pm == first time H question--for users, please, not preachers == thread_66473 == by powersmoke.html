				Just picked up my mail and was grateful to see my order of 250mg coldshot from Hatter...<br />This is a first time use, mainly to substitute for the opana/dilaudid use that has gotten EXPENSIVE in my household....<br /><br />Typical use is 4 or 5 (4mg) dilaudid tab&#039;s dissolved in bacteriostatic or sterile saline, filtered through .22mic filter into 3 cc syringe and administered IM (glute)-- at least twice a day, sometimes 3.<br />Either that or, +/- 60mg opana IM using alcohol separation process.<br />Guesstimating, what would ya think is comparable dose of the hatter product?<br /><br />And, just to ease my naive fears of &quot;OH GOD---IV!!??&quot; are there any oddball effect to watch far?<br /><br />This product is completely foreign to my locale, and after many many years of sortid use of various substances, I havent ever heard/seen/met anyone thats ever used H.<br />I&#039;m jus sayin...no knowledge to fall back on.<br />

				are you doing 60 mg of oxymorphone at once?!<br /><br />i would guess you must not be extracting it completely<br /><br />if you are getting a full 60 mg dose of oxymorphone you might be disappointed by H honestly, OM is one of the most potent opioids there is and thats a pretty massive dose - enough to kill many people, so i am assuming you must have a pretty decent tolerance<br /><br />however - if you get comparable effects from 4 mg hydromorphone, then i would bet the extraction is not working all that well or else you should be tolerant to that as well... <br /><br />so i would base the dose conversion on the 4 mg hydromorphone and not the 60 mg of oxymorphone or else you might not get the correct amount you need.&nbsp; <br /><br />too hard to give recommendations safely - start much smaller than you think you need and work your way up. some might need 20 mg, some 50 mg, and others maybe even 100 mg H
