				Over the last 6-8 months, I&#039;ve been using a lot of 2cb with my friends. It seems to be a recurring issue that the onset can be very unpredictable - ranging from 20 minutes to 3 hours after consumption. Naturally, we&#039;d all like to be peaking/enjoying the visuals at the same time together, so it can be a bit annoying. Does anyone else find this?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found the body load to be rather unpleasant, and the only way to get rid of it is to stop focusing on it. Unfortunately, I have a scumbag brain and it always brings me right back to thought loops about feeling nauseous.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, 2cb is a consistently lovely drug. Nice, holographic/brightened visuals, suitable for first time friends who just want to dip a toe in the psychedelic pond, and almost always a lovely inward trip when you just feel like going off by yourself to enjoy.<br /><br />I generally go for 20mg, but have taken 40mg before after redosing and assuming my capsule was a dud over three hours after taking it.<br /><br />What have your experiences with it been like?

				Are you car sick?<br /><br />The 2c-x&#039;s seem to trigger motion sickness in those who have it, at least from my friends&#039; and my experience.

				When I was younger I was prone to carsickness, but that hasn&#039;t been an issue for a long time. :( I like rollercoasters and all that, so I&#039;m not sure. That might well be a contributor though.<br /><br />
