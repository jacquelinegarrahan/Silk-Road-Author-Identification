				Anybody know what Changa is and how to make it? I have a bud who is raving about it and I am sure that given the supply of drugs on here I can get the necessary ingredients.

				Cheers Sam, thanks for being a cunt.<br /><br />Anybody sensible out there? <br /><br />I know its a DMT source material mixed with a MAOI inhibitor but I was wondering if there is a specific mix.

				Hang on, who made you the SR police? <br /><br />This is a forum for discussion of drug safety, I want to know how to safely combine drugs to make the mixture known as changa. If you took the time to look on SR you would see that nobody is selling changa, which is why I was asking how to make it.<br /><br />If you dont have anything useful to add then please move along.<br /><br />And for the record, I wasnt asking to buy anything, if I was then I would have put the post in Product Requests.<br />

				No Sam, the point is that nobody is making any money out of it so I want to know how to make it.<br /><br />You are an argumentative one arent you? Why dont you leave my thread alone and go back to dosing your kids with acid?

				No Sam, you werent. You told me to pour motor oil and gasoline over my head and set it on fire, not exactly very helpful.<br /><br />What you have said is exactly why I am asking, I know what plants contain DMT, and which contain MAOIs but want to make sure that I am using a safe combination. <br /><br />If you dont have anything&nbsp; useful to say then please piss off.

				Ah, very clever Sam. Well done, have a gold star for demonstrating your superior intellect.<br /><br />Once again, as your comprehension skills don&#039;t seem to match your talents in sarcasm.<br /><br />If you have nothing useful to add please piss off.

				You take care now Sam, its been a pleasure.<br /><br />If anybody sensible is still reading after all that, does anybody have any idea what typically constitutes Changa?<br />By that I mean which plant species are best in a mix for smoking without having to extract DMT or purchase the freebase.

				Hahaha... interesting thread. <br /><br />There was a similar post yesterday here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9074<br /><br />Basically Changa is DMT mixed into leaf from an MAOI containing plant. The MAOI&#039;s from the plant prevent the body from breaking down the DMT as quickly, thus allowing the trip to last longer. <br />I&#039;m not sure of the exact process to make it, but I know there are many tutorials available. Try the DMT-Nexus and some other similar forums and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find many options.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what you meant by &quot;which plant species are best in a mix for smoking without having to extract DMT or purchase the freebase.&quot;<br />From what I know Changa is the mix of DMT and an MAOI containing plant. So you would need to acquire both freebase DMT and the plant and then start the process.<br /><br />There&#039;s also 2 vendors that carry what you are looking for, though not specifically at this time.<br /><br />DiMiTriSpice (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/32181) carries Changa, but is currently out of stock.<br />Walter (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/15883) has some MAOI containing Banisteriopsis Caapi Alkaloids, as well as pure D.<br /><br />Hope I helped. There&#039;s a bit more detail on Changa, what specific plants to use, and safety/medical precautions in the other thread.
