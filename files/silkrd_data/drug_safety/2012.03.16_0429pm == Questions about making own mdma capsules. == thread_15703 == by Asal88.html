				I want to make a few capsules out of some mdma I have (for personal use).<br />Thinking of making 100mg ones so could anyone recomend a good capsule size?<br />And what is the best material e.g. gelatine?<br /><br />cheers

				100mg fills about 75% of a &#039;0&#039; size gelatine capsule.<br /><br />I use different coloured caps for each drug/ dose for easy ID in a dark nightclub. <br /><br />Mannitol is a good inert cutting agent, I like to pack my gel caps tightly so they don&#039;t crush so easily in my pocket.

				Back in my working at parties days I would just buy a bottle of echinacea caps and empty them out, weigh out .1 and tip it in there with a tiny funnel I made. I really don&#039;t miss doing that...lol. So...many...caps...

				If you cannot find different coloured capsules - then mark them with some permanent pen. You could have the untouched capsules as 100mg - and if you do any more powerful doses - colour them black. Top up doses of around 50mg can be coloured in half.<br /><br />Its wise to weigh up mdma crystal before going out! Judging mg when already rocking a bit is not easy.<br /><br />Good safety advice here.

Definitely you should scale each dose as you make the pills. I found it tedious the one time I did it. There is no reliable standard which correlates the weight and volume of mdma, as it comes in many varying forms. The only way to know your pill has 100 mg is if a scale tells you before you cap it.

				Size 0.<br />Get an mg scale.<br />Weigh an empty cap. Mine weigh 100mg.<br />Then put whatever in, and weigh again.<br /><br />My scale is cheap so it has an error of +/- 2mg usually, but that&#039;s not a problem with MDMA.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15703.msg153691#msg153691">Quote from: wowzers on March 16, 2012, 04:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mannitol is a good inert cutting agent, I like to pack my gel caps tightly so they don&#039;t crush so easily in my pocket.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thanks for this.

				i hope to get also that amount (1g) of mdma from a seller here. he was kind enough to ask me if i wanted him to split it up into single doses, so i&#039;m going to say yes since i don&#039;t have a scale yet. i wonder how much those cost and where i&#039;d have to go and get it in my city.

Better to buy locally then the person can calibrate it in front of you though if you place 20 US nickles on it apparently that&#039;s 100g you can use for calibration in a jam<br />
