				My partner and I have a fetish for sex while I am semiconscious or unconscious. Being very stoned works ok. Being asleep generally works (I sleep heavy) or when waking up. We are curious to try drugs intended for this purpose, though. I have heard of Rohypnol. I am curious about others. Think of it like &quot;date rape&quot; but it&#039;s neither a &quot;date&quot; (we are in a committed relationship) nor a rape (this is consensual).<br /><br />Experienced suggestions are very welcome, along with advice on how to do this safely.

				Zolpidem, if you take dose above 10mg, hallucination and half asleep hypnotic state is possible and after 4 hours you&#039;d realized you had done something which you didn&#039;t intend to. Sadly it&#039;s prescription only.<br /><br />It sounds like Ketamine might work too.

				Chloral Hydrate &quot;Knockout Drops&quot;. I have never seen this drug, but I believe thats what most people used it for. A young William Buroughs was expelled from bording school for this exact same activity.

				Yep, GHB or GBL would be a great choice for this.&nbsp; The duration is pretty short (several hours) and for most people there is zero hang over or after effects.&nbsp; (Although your private parts might hurt afterwards, but you&#039;re used to that! :)) )&nbsp; Titrate your dose up to find just the right dose to put you out.

				Personally I would recommend a high level of alcohol or benzo&#039;s for this type of activity.<br /><br />Unconscious or drunk sex is very sexy so it doesn&#039;t surprise me that a member here would choose to engage in this type of activity. <br /><br />Its been a while since I personally drugged a sex partner but I would shy away from Rohypnol or GHB for casual sex especially if you aren&#039;t highly experienced with these substances as over dosing or simply dosing too high can result in brain damage or worse.<br /><br />Not to scare anyone but both of these substances are very potent and need to be treated with a high level of respect.

				It is almost impossible to achieve an orgasm with opiates (opioid&#039;s? Sorry dont know proper terminology ) ...<br /><br />I&#039;ve had sex for 4-5 hours using OC&#039;s and on a few occasions have managed to FINALLY shoot my load....she took a lower dose and had multiple orgasms.....combine some oxys and viagra and you will be a beast sex warrior, if you manage to hang in long enough 9and she lets you hang in long enough) to shoot your inferno.....its ridiculously good....just fucking amazing
