				Even though Meph was made as an MDMA replacement - The two drugs are quite different in effects. Firstly, Meph is A LOT more stimulating. MD itself, even though its a Stim, is quite relaxing. Meph on the other hand is more of a &#039;party drug&#039;. <br /><br />MD also makes you feel love for everybody, with Meph its more a feeling that everybody is &#039;amazing&#039;. Meph has some similarities to Coke, you feel like fucking Super Man, you&#039;re confidence goes through the roof. You just want to chat and chat (Personally Meph makes me more chatty than Amphetamines do). Meph gives you a feeling of satisfaction, you feel satisfied with everything, with MD its more a feeling of complete and utter peace with the world. MD gives you empathy, you find you can think about people you may dislike, and understand where they&#039;ve been coming from. You worst enemy may seem not so bad on MD. <br /><br />They do have some similarities, like music appreciation, jaw clenching and some people get the eye wobbles on Meph and MD, (Personally Meph doesn&#039;t give them to me).<br /><br />Overall they&#039;re both completely different drugs. Meph is more of a Stimulant than MD, and it shares properties of&nbsp; both Coke and Amphetamines as well.<br /><br />I hope this has helped, have fun on both of them. - Here&#039;s some advice - <br /><br />The best dose for MD is 160mgs, that will give you a nice intense roll. (Take it orally, I find that&#039;s the best way to take MD). An hour in to the roll (Or whenever you feel you&#039;ve reached the peak) Take another 40mgs, re-dosing at the peak is said to extend it a little. Don&#039;t take a further dose, this will only waste the MD, why waste drugs??<br /><br />Meph - I&#039;d say Meph is better taken nasally, 100mgs is a good starting dose. I find doing 100mgs, then every 20 mins or so do 50mg bumps to keep the buzz going. - Oh and I forgot to mention, with Meph you CAN re-dose, re-dosing always works! Unlike with MD... <br /><br />Happy rolling fellow Silk Roader!!

				It is pretty tough to tell apart any stims until much much later. If you are worried about getting burned on a deal then you just have to use your best discretion... Do you trust the vendor ? If you have met him in the real world, did they go clubbing too ? <br /><br />Ever since Meph became a thing anyone had heard of around where I am (when methedrone was in the news a lot 4 or 5 years ago), I have worried about buying anything in powder form, and particularly for things like MDMA which is fairly rare over here. While I haven&#039;t often indulged, I strongly suspect that easilly half of the things that have been sold to friends of mine as MDMA has been mostly speed or meph with a little sprinkle of MDMA. Now, that&#039;s the nature of the business of course, things get stepped on. But it eventually warps one opinion of what drugs are supposed to feel like and makes it really hard to call bullshit. <br /><br />In the long-long-ago, I was walking home with a new aquired friend from a club. We were on the way to a mutual friends place to pick up his stuff on the way back. We took a short cut across a grave yard and ran into a nice gentleman who asked if he could nab a few rizlas, which I promptly produced. The guy made up three parachutes of what he claimed were MDMA, and for our troubles gave us one each. Being young and dumb we went bottoms up, and continued on our way. We got home a little later and started coming up. The contents was not MDMA. It was some pretty nice speed, but it wasn&#039;t MDMA. And I suspect that almost any MDMA come across in such a casual way is of a similar quality.<br /><br />Obviously there has to be trust, so all you can do is not give vendors return business. If they are a friend (ie you hang out when you aren&#039;t doing drugs) then feel free to bitch but that&#039;s pretty unlikely.&nbsp;
