				Be extremely careful with the stuff. play it on the conservative side, 0.5 mg (500 micrograms) or less for the first time, which could be a fraction of a tab. I have a friend IRL who ended up in the hospital after taking 2 tabs of 25i. This stuff can wreck you if you aren&#039;t careful. I assume you&#039;re buying the tabs right?

				Do an allergy test first. If you&#039;re buying blotters (assuming 1mg each), cut up one tab into equal 4 pieces and drop one piece. If you&#039;re not buying blotters, take about 200 micrograms.<br />After you know your body won&#039;t react harshly to the chemical, I wouldn&#039;t take more than one hit for your first trip on it. I took a 1mg blotter my first time and had an extremely pleasant experience, I fucking loved it. There were a few times that it was overwhelming though, and looking back on it I should have only took half a tab.<br /><br />Allergy test first, then half a hit.

				ok, that&#039;s a reasonable side. here&#039;s what your procedure should be<br />1) cut the blotter in half<br />2) take a tiny nibble of said half, consuming only 50-100 micrograms or so of material<br />3) wait at least 2 hours and make sure that the drug hopefully has little to no noticeable effects<br />4) when it&#039;s confirmed that you&#039;re not &quot;allergic&quot;, ingest the 400 microgram remainder of that half tab. If the 400 is underwhelming, step up your dosage in increments of AT MOST 200 micrograms. The dose/response curve for the stuff is quite ridiculous.<br />That&#039;s pretty much all I gotta say.<br />Happy tripping!<br />Also: Make sure to have a sitter and some benzos (or etizolam) on hand in case things go bad. You can never be too careful

				so im guessing 1000µg is 1000 micrograms? so i shud cut it in half, take it (gueessing&nbsp; mouthwash and on top gums or under tounge?) and if nothing goes bad in 2 hours, take the other half. and how long would that last me

				I said take a lot less than a half at first. It&#039;s always recommended to do an &quot;allergy test&quot; on RCs before consumption.<br />For your own safety, you should just nibble off a tiny bit of the tab first (100 micrograms or less) to see if it hits you really hard or has some kind of negative effects.<br />It could be extremely dangerous to just take the whole mg on the first try. Once you pass your allergy test (give it a couple hours, patience is key) feel free to eat half a tab. Be careful with redosing though. I generally don&#039;t recommend it for psychedelics

				My first time I tried 25i I took 1mg(1000ug) and was disappointed but had a good time, it just wasn&#039;t as &quot;mind blowing&quot; as my other buddies described it. 1.5mg is my favorite dose it had me laughing my ass off at the visuals protruding from my tv for a good hour and a half.<br /><br />This is a really fun chem because it produces psychedelic effects without sacrificing mental clarity. Have fun and be safe!

				i would recommend no more than zero tabs. but seriously, be extremely careful with that stuff! it&#039;s far more physically harmful than the traditional psychedelics.

Yes I firmly believe you should do an allergy test so nothing truly detrimental happens to you, however this method would be VASTLY underwhelming. Coming from someone who has taken large amounts of 25i, re-dosing is next to futile. Once the chemical sets in, taking more of it does little more than make what you&#039;re already feeling last longer. If I were you, preform the allergy test, confirm you&#039;re good, then wait a day or 2 and take however much you&#039;re planning to ultimately take. Half a tab, and then another half a tab later that day will simply prolong the effects of the original half-tab. I usually take a single 1000ug tab, and that has me FACED. Sometimes I&#039;ll pop 2 if I&#039;m positive I&#039;m in an environment I can be in for a while without being disturbed, and have a good amount of time on my hands, as 2 tabs can get pretty crazy. <br /><br />Last time I took 2 I watched a maze made out of lights in the completely pitch-black sky. Can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t love it.
