				never tried ketamine but always wanted for recreational use. Want to try IM to K-hole and want to snort abit. But this topic isn&#039;t about that. Watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa_L5BZzPDE from 31:00 . There&#039;s this guy who abused it for couple of years and has bladder problems - pissing blood and had to undergo serious operation. What do you think about this ? Pretty scary for me if this is real.

				You&#039;d want to be taking ridiculous amounts of it to have it damage your health to that extent. In my opinion, everything in moderation is OK. Just know when to stop and you&#039;ll be fine. Ketamine can be quite moreish though :)

Ketamine is in a lower schedule/class drug to heroin. Also, it is a damn sight cheaper, easier to spot cuts, less addictive etc... Chances of being handed a prison sentence when caught with ketamine are substantially different to being caught with heroin.

				I wouldn&#039;t say you&#039;re better addicted to heroin but it&#039;s still pretty bad if you become incontinent from doing so much ketamine.<br />Constantly pissing yourself is pretty terrible!

				Abuse, of any substance, always poses health risks.<br /><br />If you want to abuse K for years like the guy in the documentary, then the &quot;blatter problem&quot; could become yours,<br />but if your desire is to try it out in a small quantity and as a single experience - this kind of health problems shouldn&#039;t be your consurn. <br />At least, that&#039;s my opinion based on my personal usage of the product.

				The bladder problems only really come into effect when Ketamine is abused. I watched a program on it before and it said something like...<br />if you&#039;re doing around 1gram of Ketamine a day, there&#039;s a 50% chance you&#039;ll have bladder damage. 2 grams a day, 70% chance and 5grams and over its almost certain you&#039;ll have permanent bladder damage.

				Ive seen ketamine ruin alot of lives,now not nearly as many as heroin of course but psychedelic heroin wouldnt be its nickname if it was safe.but again i use ketaset bout once a month, 100mg injected in my muscle and must say,its a beautiful,very lucid,real life trip. id suggest reading&nbsp; d.m turners book the essential psychedelic guide. this guy was one most respected psychonauts in world,but unfortunately he became addicted to ketamine and died at very yuoung age ,mid thirties. heres list to his book<br />http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/essential_psychedelic_guide/essential_psychedelic_guide.shtml<br /><br />and read his short biography in the dm turner vault.. Very interesting man,shame we lost him so early<br /><br />Also marcia Moore is another great person to look up if ur a ketamine lover<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not shure where to post this question,<br />so why not ask it here: does anyone know how the effects are (if any) when ingesting K? <br />I&#039;ve got a 0.01g accuracy scale so I could measure the dose to wrap into a paper and then swallow it, <br />but I don&#039;t know if the K would be broken down by stomach acids or not...?<br /><br />Anyone tried this before? <br />Comments? Health risks?

The drug goes straight to the liver when it is processed into norketamine. Norketamine has greater numbing, sedating and pain-killing effects and will make it more difficult to walk or move around. The psychedelic effects on the mind also come on slower and the whole experience can be much longer, lasting up to 4 hours. Snorted doses also trigger more &#039;out of body&#039; effects than oral doses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What&#039;s with this 1 gram a day?<br /><br />I put 1 gram in a vial with 100ml sterile saline solution.<br /><br />Inject intramuscular 10ml (1CC) and get a great k-hole at only 100mg.<br /><br />Do this once a week and your pace is 1 gram every 10 weeks.<br /><br />Shit, people need to be responsible with this stuff.
