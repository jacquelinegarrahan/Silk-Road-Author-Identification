				Hi guys,<br /><br />trying LSD for the first time tomorrow which I bought from EnterTheMatrix. I&#039;ve heard the dosages per tab can vary, so I&#039;m gonna go one whole tab unless people&nbsp; with experience can advise otherwise.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t have time to buy some xanax or legit anxiolytics. Is there such thing as any decent over the counter ones? I hear St. Johns Wort can help with anxiety. I&#039;m planning this in case I have a shitty trip btw. For details sake I&#039;m taking with one friend, and two sitters. <br /><br />Thanks :) <br /><br />- Bonfils.

				i don&#039;t have an answer but i want to suggest only doing this as a last resort in the event of a bad trip.<br /><br />try sitting through the bad trip. meditate.&nbsp; <br /><br />i don&#039;t regret any of my bad trips. i learned a lot from them.

				Thanks Scientist, will keep that in mind. I&#039;m quite experienced with meditation and have been doing so for some years, so I will prepare myself by meditating prior to the session and will keep it in mind for when I&#039;ve taken also.

				Also try meditating INTO the trip. That is, after you dose, light some incense and sit down. Meditate. Forget that you took a stamp. Sit there and stay clear. You&#039;ll come up soon enough and you&#039;ll feel the light. <br /><br />If you absolutely must take some natural anxiolytic, I would suggest Valerian Root. It will ease you right away especially if you don&#039;t ever take benzos.

				Satori is one of the most beautiful experiences one can have. <br /><br />And then to experience it again later on when sober, even more beautiful.

				Thanks zipstyle and scientist, all noted. Sounds beautiful.<br /><br />What would you say re: dosage? I&#039;ve heard both some great and underwhelming things about these tabs, so I&#039;m not sure how to proceed. Would it be wise to have half then half later, or just do the whole thing? <br />Vendor says average is ~200iu, Avengers tested at below ~150iu. People on bluelight.ru seem to love it though. For reference I&#039;m roughly 183 pounds/83kilos.

				I&#039;ve taken a lot of EnterTheMatrix LSD tabs. The first time I took 2 tabs having never taken LSD before and it was perfect. These days I pop 5 at a time. I recommend you do not take just one as it will be underwhelming and disappointing.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t get paranoid or stressed on marijuana then I don&#039; t think you&#039;ll stress out on LSD. But you won&#039;t be able to sleep for at least 16 hours without taking something due to the stimulating effects.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s awesome! You&#039;ll be back for more like me.

				I doubt St John&#039;s wort will have any effect.&nbsp; I think its intended to be taken over a period of time to improve your mood rather than an immediate lift.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard drinking a load of alcohol is a way to dull a bad trip?&nbsp; Probably not advised..<br /><br />I&#039;m also having my first lsd experience at the weekend :)

				cannabis always helps me if i&#039;m feeling anxious during a trip. meditation is probably the best thing you can do. quiet your mind until the anxiety melts away.

Weight doesn&#039;t really play too much of a role with LSD since its mostly transferred through the blood vessels in your mouth. Keep the paper in there until it&#039;s all falling apart. Play with the paper, meditate, and then enjoy :)
