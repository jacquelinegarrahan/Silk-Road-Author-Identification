				I have never attempted to lay blotters before If someone could link me to a guide that would be great!<br /><br />My understanding is of of laying alprazolam is first dissolve it in propylene glycol then leave it in a flat tray with your blotter sheet until it has dried.<br />So if i have 400 blotters and I want to to make each one 250ug i need 100mg of alprazolam and use how much propylene glycol, 100ml? Less?<br /><br />I would appreciate if someone who knows there stuff about blotting could give me some guidance as well as any tips they might have.<br /><br />Much Love...

				You really don&#039;t want to try to lay blotters with propylene glycol. Get some ethanol.<br /><br />There are a number of guides around.&nbsp; Use the search function.&nbsp; It&#039;s there for a reason.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;m not pleased about people lazily posting a new thread, wanting someone to go use the search function for them.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a dozen discussions about it, but I don&#039;t automatically know the url to those threads.&nbsp; If I were to point you to a thread, I&#039;d have to go use the search function myself.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ll give you a couple pointers.&nbsp; What kind of paper are you using?&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend unless you&#039;re going to be doing this a lot, laying the blotter drop-wise rather than saturating it by placing it in solution.&nbsp; You may do as you see fit.&nbsp; Actually, since this is such a topic of interest, Maybe I&#039;ll write a guide on this.&nbsp; PM me with any additional questions you have.

				Ethanol.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just lay all of the liquid on then let it sit there.&nbsp; The dosage range from tab to tab will be completely uneven.&nbsp; Figure out the absorbancy of the blotter paper that you&#039;re using.&nbsp; Use a variable volume micropipette to lay each tab.&nbsp; Or use a multichannel micropipette to lay several tabs at a time and get the work done faster.&nbsp; Or buy a auto pipette liquid handler to lay sheets at a time.<br /><br />Here is a quote of mine from another thread that should be able to prepare you for the task.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154524.msg1080040#msg1080040">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on May 02, 2013, 01:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Weigh the dry sheet.&nbsp; Figure out the retention volume of the blotter.&nbsp; Saturate the sheet for a few minutes.&nbsp; Hold it for a couple minutes to allow the extra to drip off.&nbsp; Weigh it again.&nbsp; The difference is the solvent retained in the sheet.&nbsp; One gram of water is about 1ml at 72 degrees.<br /><br />Say it&#039;s a 100 tab sheet and it retained 15 grams.&nbsp; Divide the retained solvent by the number of hits to get the maximum amount of solvent that can be absorbed per tab, aka 0.15ml or 150ul.&nbsp; The dispensed volume should be about 30% of the max saturation limit, aka 45ul per tab.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of typing.&nbsp; You should have it from here....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I don&#039;t know about alprazolam but I can describe what I do with LSD.<br /><br />First I decide how much drug I want on how much paper. So lets say I want 10,000 hits of 200ug blotter.<br /><br />I cut up a hundred 2.5x2.5 inch square pages, plus 20 extra for calibration. Each 2.5 inch square paper can be divided 100 times making it 10,000 hits worth of paper.<br /><br />Then I do some math, 10,000 hits at 200ug: 10,000 * .0002 = 2 grams of LSD<br /><br />Then I take clean solvent and dip 20 pages into it. I measure the amount that the 20 pages absorb. I then multiply that by 5 to figure out how much 100 will absorb.<br /><br />So lets say that 20 pages absorbs 30ml of liquid. That means I need 150ml of solvent for 2 grams.<br /><br />Now, you don&#039;t want to be running out on the last page so you make more solution than you need. Multiply both by 120%, so I get 2.4 grams in 180ml of alcohol.<br /><br />Once I have a solution of LSD and solvent I completely submerge and saturate each sheet of paper in the liquid. I do it fast and close the container between sheets to prevent evaporation. The remaining liquid can be used in the next batch.<br /><br />Take non-absorbant thread and make a mesh from it to dry your pages on. Do not stack the pages on top of each other. Take care not to let your solvent evaporate too much, with LSD an extra kick is nice but with xanny this may be an issue.<br /><br />With xanax you are going to want at least 1mg on each tab so I don&#039;t know how big you will have to make the tabs. If you put too much on a small tab it will flake off.<br />
