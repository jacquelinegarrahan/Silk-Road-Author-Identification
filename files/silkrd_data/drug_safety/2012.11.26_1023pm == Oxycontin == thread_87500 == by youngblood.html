				#1 Injection of pills is in no words a safe process, think of all the binders and fillers to hold these pills together.<br />#2 It can be done, but if you are needing to ask if/how/why DON&#039;T you risk MUCH MUCH more severe opiate dependance let alone destroying veins through inadequate filtering<br /><br />To sum it up, don&#039;t do it, if crushing/snorting/sticking them up your poop hole aint&#039; getting you enough of a rush, maybe start a detox program.<br /><br />(In my honest opinion and experience from knowing plentiful of IV users, when all bullshit is aside they all wish they&#039;d never had gone there.<br />Stop while you&#039;re ahead.

				Just plug it! Buy a baby syringe, crush up your dose, mix with water until it&#039;s all absorbed, suck up the water and push it into your bum. Gets your high as hell for an extra hour or two.<br /><br />You want the rush, just buy heroin from the road.

				better to snort, it is really not safe to IV because it looks like very unfiltered and looks not clear like water!<br />

				Even if you found a way to filter out the binders effectively, injecting Oxycontin is very unsafe!<br /><br />Oxycodone, along with hydrocodone and other codine derivatives, cause a large histamine release within the body. The faster the onset, the stronger the histamine release. IV oxy and hydro causes such a large histamine release it can kill you or land you in the hospital. It might not happen every time, but if you&#039;re having an unlucky day you very well might end up dead. <br /><br />There&#039;s a reason they don&#039;t make IV oxy or hydro, but do of most other opiates. It&#039;s just not safe.

They are derived from the thebaine alkaloid in poppies, and they like the rest of thebaine derivatives are stimulatory instead of depressant. Thebaine in larger doses is poisonous, with effects resembling strychnine poisoning. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">cause a large histamine release within the body.

The reason it is so dangerous, as said above, is the fillers. It&#039;s a dual polymer matrix and they are filled with all kinds of inert filler bullshit, including talc (which is extremely dangerous to shoot). You need to filter with wheel filters.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There&#039;s a reason they don&#039;t make IV oxy or hydro, but do of most other opiates.

They have less, but not necessarily less dangerous, fillers. Invest in a luer lock syringe, and some wheel filters, or a wheel that can be used on a normal single use. But honestly, aside from the rush, which you have to do a good amount to get, there really is no reason to IV OxyContin, either snort it, or do as early suggested and mix it down in an oral syringe, take a huge dump, then cram that puppy up da butt, you&#039;ll get almost as good a &quot;rush&quot; as IV if you do it right. If you really just want to shoot an opiate, and get the rush, grab some good #4 H, and have a better,safer experience.
