				Ok I was giving a lil over a gram of a crystal form Suppose Ket. My question is how can i know if its real? Without a regent test? Iv herd if u put it in water and it desolvs smoothly then thats one way.. I have never done this but sounds like something id like to try simply cause i hear it helps depression which is my worst demon. I dont wanna get soo trippy the first time i just wanna get a slight feeling to know what is to come if more is done.. Can someone give me info and also tell me what the feeling is of being in a &quot;K-hole&quot; Is it scary? How long does it last?? Please help guys..BTW i got it from india, I had some guy send me a bunch of xanax bars and he sent over halg G of ket also to try. What worries me is the Xanax bars were bogus, and i dont know how to tell if the ket is real..

				Hey,<br /><br />The look of K can vary from batch to batch but in general, especially if it is coming from India, the K should be in small shards or granules. Without a test kit you arent going to be 100%&nbsp; its K until you try it<br /><br />If your k is in a shard/grain form I recommend dissolving your 1/2g in a couple of table spoons of boiling water. Then place the K solution onto a plate. Place this plate on top of a pan of boiling water and let the heat of the stream evaporate the liquid off from the K solution. After 10/15 mins you should be left with the recrystallized Ketamine on the plate. Make sure there is no moisture left in these crystals then scrape them up with a razor or card. Work these crystals with your card until you are left with a nice fine powder. <br /><br />For a starting dose I would recommend 30mg-50mg line. That should give you a slight &quot;wonky&quot; feeling. You&nbsp; can work your way up from there. I would say 90mg-150mg for a first timer should be enough to hole. I guess a hole is different for each person but for me I really love it. You cant really describe the sensation to anyone. If i were you I would put some headphones, close your eyes reach a hole :) great feeling. <br /><br />Now just dont go abusing it too much, tolerance builds up very fast with K, which I know all to well :(<br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />Right<br /><br />PS if you wouldnt mind sharing your India link, send me a PM. Would love to get some K off him myself. Would be very much appreciated.

				rightonion is pretty spot on.<br /><br />I guess ketamine is a love it or hate it drug. I loved it... <br /><br />if you want to relieve your depression then use low doses as infrequently as once you experience a hole it can become an obsession. I recently had a fair bit here with the intention of testing the waters here but it turns out it isn&#039;t the greatest thing in the world for me to keep around... Read ketamine: Dreams and Realities and also about ketamine bladder syndrome so you can spot the danger signs before it takes hold.<br /><br />You will do anything to experience the complete peace that K can do for a depressed mind and that isn&#039;t always a good thing but in my experience I had a regular supply that was cheap so it was all to easy to fall into that trap.

				Some solid info up here I just wanted to add a few cents. <br /><br />I&#039;d go slow on the dosaging. I&#039;ve only snorted mine and the first time I did it I went to about 70mg, fairly staggered out over 30 minutes or so, and I remember feeling really nervous the first time because of how heavy my body felt. I&#039;m pretty good about keeping my anxiety under control when doing drugs but just start slow and play things safe because it is pretty intense.<br /><br />If you do decide to snort it (or however) I suggest taking it someplace where you can relax and be comfortable. Don&#039;t go places or try it in public. As to the antidepressant or anxiolytic effects, I think that&#039;s the kind of thing that will very from individual to individual. If that&#039;s what you really want then I&#039;d start with a 15mg line snorted and when it kicks in see if your mental state is any different(it&#039;ll be subtle) and see if it changes over the next two hours(from administration). A lot of drug use seems to be a crutch (speaking as someone who uses multiple crutches) so it won&#039;t be a miracle cure but likely a temporary one. So just go in with realistic expectations. <br /><br />My best Ket experience was on about 100mg of Ket snorted over the course of about 5-10 minutes and then smoking DMT. (Don&#039;t do this!) If the Ket turns out to be good I&#039;d try measuring your based on your initial, low-dose, experience and your body weight. I find it can be very therapeutic to lay back and relax--it&#039;s like an easy and intense way to meditate so it could prove beneficial to any negative thoughts/emotions you ahve.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have or aren&#039;t willing to get a test for the ket I&#039;d start very small, 10mg line snorted, and work your way up to no more than 50mg over the course of an hour and see if you feel the effects that are reported by Ket users. The only reason I&#039;d caution this so strongly is because you said this same guy gave you bogus xanax (how did you determine that?). If one thing is fake or contaminated in some way I&#039;d be very weary of taking anything else from the same vendor. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />
