				So, I know if you are taking pretty much any psychedelic if you are having a bad trip taking some Xanax or some Valium will help taper you off and calm you down.<br /><br />If you take a pill that ends up being too strong or too much molly what is suggested to be done? Is there a quick solution or is it just to ride it out or go to the hospital? <br /><br />Never had any bad experience myself but was curious what to do if it happened to anyone around me etc?

				Shulgin refrenced taking a SSRI at the end of a roll to prevent any hangover, though I believe he warned if taken too early it could dampen the effects of the roll. That is if my memory serves me correctly.

				You can try tryptamine stuff which i heard is good after rolling, but i usually take 5htp before i sleep and for the next couple of days. If i have a xanax i take that to sleep, then 5htp the next day.

				SSRIs will tone down your roll. But, be safe. Know what you&#039;re taking before you&#039;re taking it and don&#039;t be stupid. <br /><br />I believe Celexa is what a friend of mine carries around when he rolls.

				Just curious, does anyone know how SSRIs will tone down the roll? If the reuptake of seretonin is lowered, wouldn&#039;t that mean more seretonin available to your brain, and thus a more intense experience?<br /><br />Further, isn&#039;t there the risk of seretonin syndrome, too much seretonin to the point of toxicity?<br /><br />I could be missing something obvious here though, so if anyone can enlighten me that would be great.

				Vitamin C would be good to take, as would magnesium (especially magnesiuum glycinate). Tea would probably help. Fruit would definitely be beneficial if you can find it while you&#039;re rolling. Basically anything that will decrease cellular excitation while supporting the increased rate of metabolism which MDMA demands, will attenuate an overdose. My ChillPill is designed with that in mind, and would probably be effective in that situation.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36197.msg414346#msg414346">Quote from: Spunkaroo on August 17, 2012, 10:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just curious, does anyone know how SSRIs will tone down the roll?

When you inject an animal with serotonin it becomes lethargic and helpless, which is roughly opposite to the effects of the anti-serotonin psychedelics. This is also why taking SSRIs are anti-psychedelic and promote suicide.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Further, isn&#039;t there the risk of seretonin syndrome, too much seretonin to the point of toxicity?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, there is, and even at non-acutely-toxic levels serotonin has a wide range of harmful effects on our physiology. I don&#039;t recommend that the average person take any 5-HTP supplements, since the proteins most people consume are already high in tryptophan.

				I took too much Molly on an empty stomach at a Music Festival last year and ended up getting overheated (it was over 100 degrees F midday) and dry-heaving in front of a cop who was laughing at me cus he thought I was drunk, could have died the dumbass pig&nbsp; :P. I just took my shirt off (which was black, yeah stupid I know) and drank and poured my water over myself and stood in the shade. So if you are outside when its hot and u take too much molly, shirt off, drink water, keep cool in shade, or u could have a heatstroke. Thats my .02BTC

				I haven&#039;t rolled in about 5 years. One bad roll stopped the whole show for me. I&#039;d had probably rolled 300+ times before my bad roll, and I had taken countless rolls. Then one night I took 8 white umbrella crops. They kicked in about 30 mins later, but it felt like I was on pure speed. I freaked out all night, and the next day when I smoked a joint to chill out I started having panic attacks. I stayed stone sober for about 3 years because of that night--which really sucked cause I love weed. I finally went to a psyc about it and was prescribed 100MG of Prestiq, and 2mg of Xanax a day. It&#039;s helped a lot, and today I think I&#039;m back to my old self. I probably wont take x again, but I won&#039;t forgot how much fun I had with it. <br /><br />Roll on, guys.

				Not sure if there is danger in mixing the two (and if there is please advise, i&#039;ll delete my mistake), but a bit of GHB would probably calm a roll.&nbsp; Just BE CAREFUL, don&#039;t want to slip into one of those GHB &#039;comas&#039;

				If you&#039;re talking in terms of having a bad roll mentally then If you stick to a sensible dosage then it&#039;s pretty much impossible to have a bad roll, you can&#039;t help but enjoy it. The first 2 minutes when it all hits you can sometimes be overwhelming (at high dosages), but this can be sorted very easily by going for some air and just thinking about things that make you happy. :)<br /><br />Physically having a bad roll.. we all know that MDMA is pretty harsh on your brain.. so to try to prevent damage don&#039;t mix the MDMA with other drugs, keep the dosage low, sip water throughout the roll, take lots of vitamins beforehand and after, eat good &amp; healthy meals.

				What should one do about a harsh comedown?&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean depression or anxiety, I mean that time when you&#039;re actively coming down from the roll and the rate at which the happiness and euphoria goes away is almost painful.&nbsp; I&#039;m fine about an hour after that, but that half hour or so sucks so bad.

				I don&#039;t understand how one could have a bad roll. If you space your experiences out by months, the comedown isn&#039;t very uncomfortable at all. Just sit around listening to music and smoking pot all day and it&#039;ll be a very pleasant day. And take 5-HTP to replenish your seratonin.

It will also calm the eye wiggles and jaw clenching if you don&#039;t find those enjoyable. <br /><br />As for a ghb coma, that&#039;s what testing is for. So you take 1g, note how you feel, take 1.5g on another day, note how you feel ... eventually you&#039;ll find a dose that will make you too sleepy to enjoy it and while that wont put you into a coma, that&#039;s near the dose you want to avoid since who wants to fall asleep while rolling? Coma dose would be a few grams higher than your too-sleepy-to-enjoy-the-rest-of-the-evening dose. I&#039;ve never taken that much myself.
