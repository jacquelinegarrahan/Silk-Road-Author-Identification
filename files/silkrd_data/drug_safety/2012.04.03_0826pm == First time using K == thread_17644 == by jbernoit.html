				I&#039;m interested in trying K... any advice? What is a good first dose? How long does it last? What are the best places/environments to try it? Does it have a stimulating effect, meaning would I need a benzo or something to help with comedown like with coke. Thanks!

				Do it in your bed and lay down and watch yourself depart from your body.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry if you feel like you died and your leaving your body, its just part of it.&nbsp; Quite amazing experience.&nbsp; As far as dose, I don&#039;t remember, its been a while, but if it is too much to handle have a bottle of pepsi or coke with you as the sugar will kill the high if you go too deep down the k hole :)

				I would start with about 30mg if you are doing nasal. Wait about 10 minutes and see how you feel. Keep doing 20mg bumps until you feel like you have had enough. I like to listen to music and be in complete darkness and close my eyes. I find that your choice of music really guides the trip a lot.

				I notice that K has very variable sensitivity rates than other substances. I would start as low as you can and work up to make sure you&#039;re not too sensitive. I personally get high anxiety from K in anything beyond a very small does (many get the opposite effects, this is just me). K can always be redosed to increase the effects if you want to get higher.

				@ the OP. <br /><br />Do it mate it&#039;s one of the most fun drugs there is. If you are feeling adventurous do a few lines of coke with it or mix it with MDMA. If you are feeling really ballsy mix them together in a line and do it all in one. Probably better off doing that after you have tried K on its own and mixed it with MD or Coke individually though. <br /><br />Have fun! :)

				i think 175-200mg is my sweetspot with K used IM.<br />But rule of thumb for firsties, do 10mg up each nostril every 5-10 minutes until you get the feel of it.<br />K lasts about 20 minutes so no matter how crazy your mind gets on you know you will be sober again in 20 minutes and enjoy your own private fantasy. <br />Sweetest drug research i&#039;ve had in a decade, those Ketamax vials from peaceandlove....cheap,&nbsp; reliable and full of experience.

				Just take a car key and dip it into your bag and do a bump. there is really no need to weigh it out. but if you&#039;re looking for dosages and how much you should take you should check erowid.com.<br /><br />Ketamine is a wonderful drug and has made me very happy for awhile now. quite possible my favorite drug. <br /><br />if you want to have a good flip try Ketamine + shrooms.&nbsp; ;D
