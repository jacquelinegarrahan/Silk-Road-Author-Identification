				i have some questions, hope someone can help me with this, i put 99ml of distilled water and 1 ml of alcohol in a Glass beakers, put in there 600mg of 25c HCL, i mix for 30 minutes with a agitator, all mix really good, i use a pipette to make 2 bottles with 20ml and one big with the rest<br /><br />i try before the droppers and deliver 20 drops per ml<br /><br />i made the maths<br /><br />600mg / 100 = 6mg per ml<br /><br />1 ml = 20 drops<br /><br />6mg / 20 drops = .300ug<br /><br />1 drop = 300Ug ?<br /><br />i made some blotters, but dont work, i dont have tolerance to psychedelics, i use it for business not for fun :)<br /><br />i try under 1 blotter with 1 drop sub lingual (without swallow saliva per 30 mins) , nothing happend, 2 hours later y try another blotter with 1 drop on my gums, and again nothing happend :(<br /><br />i have a good scale, maybe just are my newbie maths, can you help me with this please, iam pretty sure are my maths the problem<br /><br />Help :(

				Your math looks good to me. The trouble with droppers is that there can be quite a bit of variation in how many drops come out of a single mL. In the past I&#039;ve had to test this several times or more to get a more accurate picture of how many drops come form a mL. If you only tested once and found 20 drops, you may do it again and find 25 drops. That drops your concentration down to 240 micrograms. See what I&#039;m saying?<br /><br />In anycase, I don&#039;t believe the variation is your problem here. I believe it&#039;s your dose, personally. 300 micrograms is a very low dose. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d be affected by a dose that low myself. And another thing about these NBOMes is that redosing will be met by a rapid increase in tolerance.<br /><br />From what I&#039;m seeing seeing here, my recommendation would be to stop at this point. At least you know that you have no serious or unusual reaction to the compound (a good thing).<br /><br />Now... got back it it fresh. Tomorrow, or in a day or two for best results. Take a higher dose. 600 micrograms minimum. If it were me, I&#039;d take 800-900 micrograms (3 drops). THEN you should see some magic.<br /><br />For optimal results (IMHO), prepare the tab ahead of time, let it dry or whatever. Gently brush your gums in the place that you intead to place the tab. For me, this would be my upper right gum near the front. Gentle brushing of the gums roughs things up just enough to allow for optimal absorbtion. Not necessary by any means, but worth it imo.<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work let me know so we can get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried a dose this low before so it&#039;s hard to say if the dose itself is the problem here or something else. But your math looks fine to me.<br /><br />PM me if I forget to check back or if I can be of any help :)<br />goodluck<br /><br />

				i test the droppers before use it , this droppers are news , deliver 20 drops per ml<br />the day of my report i say 300ug sublingual 2 hours later put under my upper gum another 300<br /><br />600ug the same day, i think 600 are not so low, not to low to dont feel nothing, a year ago i try 1/4 of blotter of 800ug i really feel it. i dont know what to think about this :/<br /><br />i clean my mouth before take both dose<br />&nbsp; <br />i ask to the vendor, and he say he dont know what happend, because he&nbsp; &quot;never&nbsp; diluted it like that&quot;<br />*i use just water because i know 25c *HCL* its soluble on water* and my head says to me: We dont need ethanol because i dont gonna save this for later, i gonna laid all the blotters right know...<br /><br />the vendor suggest ethanol and leave very clear he its not gonna teach me (he say that with nice and gentle words)<br /><br />i respect that, that&#039;s not his business, and i don&#039;t pay per lessons.<br /><br /><br />2 days ago a say fuck this shit, 100 ml to the drain...<br /><br /><br />he say ethanol.... lets do this!<br /><br /><br />i Say lets start Fresh<br /><br /><br />50ml of ETHANOL / 538.930 mg of 25c-Nbome<br /><br />10.7786 Per ML / 20 <br /><br />.538ug per drop<br /><br />a friend try 2 drops, i again nothing happen...<br /><br />tomorrow i gonna try 3 drops, i dont know what more can be the problem, obviously i am a totally newbie on this, but i am doing my best, I keep my equipment clean and sterile. <br />&nbsp;

				It&#039;s either bunk OR 25C*freebase*, regardless of what the vendor believes. Freebase sounds like the most likely scenario to me because as you may know, it doesn&#039;t absorb very well on it&#039;s own. NBOMe are so cheap and profitable as they are that it&#039;s hard to imagine deliberate shenanigans on the vendor&#039;s part (assuming they are at least somewhat reputable). Perhaps that vendor&#039;s source screwed up and sent them freebase instead of the salt.<br /><br /><br /><br />You could determine if it&#039;s freebase with simple experimentation by converting it to a salt. Measure out a single dose and mix it with an equal part of lemon juice or vinegar. Preferably lemon juice. Example- 1-2 drops of your current NBOMe solution, 2&nbsp; drops of lemon juice, mix, put on some type of blotter/strip. Of course this would be overkill in terms of the amount of lemon juice needed, but it&#039;s a sure fire way to determine if you have freebase or not. Another option is to complex it with that dumb shit, HPBD or whatever the fuck it&#039;s called. I wouldn&#039;t bother with that route though because it&#039;s stupid IMO.<br /><br />IF that works (and if you have alot of NBOMe remaining that you wish to convert), then you could look up one of the many &quot;teks&quot; on how to optimally salt out the rest of your NBOMe to freebase using proper ratios of acid. If you want to put in the effort. But the lemon juice method should be sufficient enough to determine whatsup and sufficient for personal use.<br /><br />Good luck man, I hope this works for you. Whatever you do, please play it safe!<br /><br />

				yesterday i try 3 drops on a blotter,&nbsp; and feels really weird but nothing more<br /><br />i sleep and go to the work today, no problem.<br /><br />today i eat a half tab of SILo Tabs = 400Ug, just to try to keep in my mind the effects of 25c...<br /><br />FUCk i have alot of hours tripping right know, the effects i have yesterday have nothing to do how i feel today.<br /><br />i feel like<br />Yesterday i take&nbsp; 3 drops of placebo<br /><br />today i really can feel the efects, i repeat, i dont have tolerance, i just eat half tab about 7 hours, and its impossible go to sleep. <br /><br />Tomorrow gonna start with the 25c Freebase Theory<br /><br />The result of mix the solution with lemon juice must be&nbsp; A WORKING blotters or there its&nbsp; another indicator (a reaction or something), tomorrow gonna read more about it!*****<br /><br />i have clean blotters to try this :)<br /><br />the vendor send my this<br /><br />*The Product has already been verified with hNMR analysis, but given your comments, I took the time to ensure that everything continued to be as it was before*<br /><br />i gonna keep updating this thread, maybe help a newbie like me in a future,Thanks Skeletid!<br /><br />

				Hmm. After pondering this issue, your math looks pretty good but I agree with whoever said droppers are not ideal, especially with Nbomes. microliter syringes are pretty badass as you are able to say drop an EXACT known volume, for example .05 mL, my only complaint about them is that sometimes an airbubble gets in there but if you squirt it back into your container and draw it up carefully, you can minimize this. Even with the bubble, you still know the exact volume you are dropping because of the increments on the syringe. <br /><br />*The freebase theory seems the most likely. If this is true, conversion to the salt would be ideal, but another option is to complex it with HPPDB or whatever that fancy sugar is. <br /><br />*The vendor &quot;could&quot; be lying about what the product is. It would not be the 1st time a vendor has lied... Maybe it is bunk! Tell me, does it have an extremely bitter taste? He could also be misinformed as to the purity of the compound, though most Nbomes I have seen with my eyes look pretty pure. If say compound was 80% pure, then your first scenario would be 60ug short (240mg/drop), that combined with variable drops might lower it even more.<br /><br />*You &quot;could&quot; have an unusual and natural tolerance to Nbome (maybe a lower concentration of 5HT2B receptors?)&nbsp; -- In this case, you would have to up your dose, but I would do it rather slowly, and over a period of time, maybe a week between each trial. I personally have tried 25B at 400ug and definitley had minor effect from it, but it was dissolved in EtOH and insufflated. On this trial I decided I probably have a higher concentration of 5HT2B because at some point in the experience my thumb started to twitch uncontrollably, so I don&#039;t fuck with them anymore. A shame cuz I had super high hopes.<br /><br />Most of my laying experience is with LSD, which I think is a bit more forgiving than Nbomes.<br /><br />If I am laying small amounts x&gt;900tabs(usually more like 50tabs), I will dissolve in EtOH, and use the syringe. This usually takes some calibration finding the exact amount of liquid you want to use per tab. I use EtOH because it evaporates VERY quickly, and I am able to load the tab up with multiple drops within a few minutes without that tab bleeding into the surrounding tabs.<br /><br />If I am laying a page (900tabs) I will use water as my solvent, though EtOH as cosolvent would probably help. Since each sheet (100tab) will require about 2mL, I use 18mL H2O for 100mg of L.<br />I either use a syringe/dropper to spread it as evenly as I can and then I use a piece of glass to spread it around evenly as possible. The blotter tends to distribute the liquid evenly when used with water. I would not recommend using EtOH as solvent in this case, because it will be evaporating before the blotter distributes/absorbs the liquid, and you will be left with hotspots for sure. Regardless of which method you use, it is very important that the blotter you are using is very FLAT on the surface of your container, and this is to be so for the ENTIRE process. Don&#039;t for example get impatient and try and angle the page (exposing more surface area allows to dry quicker), because gravity will pull liquid down and you will have uneven laying.<br /><br />I lay them initially with the ink down so I can see the distribution on the white side of the paper, but after it is laid, I will very quickly flip it to the printed side. I&#039;ve seen the ink come off before, upon drying. When the paper is very wet, it will stay flat very easily. Using water this process takes up to 2 hours.<br />Even if you oversaturate the blotter, it will will typically rewick the liquid that didn&#039;t absorb, as it dries.<br /><br />Anyway, I wish I could be more help but maybe this helps. Whatever you do, PLEASE be careful..

				well i try with juice, nothing happen with 1500ug in a blotter. (starting with a 1/4 part of the blotter)<br /><br /><br />i am&nbsp; triying to get a small sample right now from another vendor.<br /><br />i cant send this stuff to a lab, but i can send free samples, i dont planning start a store on silkroad, just want to learn! just to confirm or deny if i am or not the problem :)<br />if someone have experience doing this, please send me a Personal Message, if this its&nbsp; against the rules of silkroad i gonna edit this<br /><br /><br /><br />thanks for take the time to read this :)
