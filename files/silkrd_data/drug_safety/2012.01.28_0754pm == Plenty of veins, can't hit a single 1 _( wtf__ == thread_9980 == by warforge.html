				i keep hearing wonderful things about where i get my H, now i have NEVER been able to fucking hit a vein right. So i am asking for you guy&#039;s advice :) . I am skinny, no fat, so veins are easy to see. But i can&#039;t see em in my arms because i am covered with ink from top to wrists. So i always sniffed, and last .1 i sniffed did nothing, person next to me shot same batch, went out to nod-ville :( . wtf am i doing wrong, yes my veins are tiny but i goto hit em, it looks like im right in ( 30g insulin needle ) only kind i can get. and i push plunger, no feeling , 5 min later i got a tiny bubble so i obviously am missing. am i going in at the wrong angle? this is just crazy to me. Any help would rock.

				don&#039;t most junkies normally tie some strap round their arm and start tapping mid-way down their arm to bring the veins up?

				perhaps life is telling you not to shoot H... ? my best advice would be to have someone experienced show you how to do it. Preferably a friend whom does NOT have hep C, HIV or any of the many other blood borne diseases. <br />It reads to me like your inserting the needle too far into your arm. you want to angle the pick the same direction the vein goes and don&#039;t forget to &quot;jack&quot; back to make sure blood enters your syringe. lets you know when your into a vein. beware of how addictive the &quot;breath&quot; from needles is. took me years to break.<br /><br />be safe

				From a junkie with 10 years exp. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is to HYDRATE! Drink 1 liter of water an hour or so before you fix. Second most important is NEW RIGS EVERY TIME! Buy them in bulk they are cheap! This will do wonders for your veins if you use fresh works all the time. Get your rig ready then swing your arm around hard for a few seconds to get all the blood to pool in the end of your hand, then QUICKLY tie off TIGHTLY using a thin tie (belt is too thick- surgical tubing is best) above your elbow half way to your shoulder. Do it TIGHT! You should see them sticking up all over even with ink. Are you &quot;registering&quot; your shot? That is, when you put the needle in do you draw the plunger back and make sure you are in by seeing if blood is rushing into the syringe? If so, then carefully switch your hand position and push the plunger down. If you feel any pain STOP! You should feel nothing when you are in a vein. Sometimes I&#039;ll push half the shot in then re-register just to make sure I&#039;m still in. If you miss and try for more than 60 seconds to hit unsuccessfully, then untie and wait 2 or 3 minutes then start over. Some people just sit there and stab and stab on the same tie off when all the blood has leaked out of their arm and back into their body. That&#039;s a very common mistake. Shoot safe shoot clean!

				You might be shooting in the wrong direction like you said, you want to shoot parallel to your vein with a SLIGHT downward angle, not completely downwards if thats what you&#039;re doing. Thats how I do it atleast

				Are you registering before you push?<br /><br />Tie off if you need to.&nbsp; Sounds like you do.<br /><br />Stay hydrated- the veins will be more pronounced.<br /><br />Use a fresh spike!<br /><br />Run the injection site under HOT water for a few minutes prior to injecting.<br /><br />Go in as parallel to the vein as you can.&nbsp; You&#039;re skinny, they won&#039;t be deep.&nbsp; Make sure you&#039;re aiming towards your heart (towards you body).<br /><br />As soon as the needle breaks the skin, pull back on the plunger- and slowly keep pushing the needle deeper.&nbsp; When the needle goes through the vein, it will immediately register. STOP pushing the needle and start pushing the plunger.&nbsp; This takes some practice, but many misses are caused because you don&#039;t hit the center of the vein, but rather the side of it.&nbsp; Then the needle pierces the side of the vein and comes right back out- hence the bubble next to your vein.<br /><br />Another technique is to just make a quick &quot;stab&quot; so that the vein is pierced before it can &quot;roll&quot; out of the way.&nbsp; Also takes practice, but should be unnecessary if you are using a fresh spike.<br /><br />Veins in the crook of your elbows tend to roll less than the ones on the back of your hands.<br /><br />Veins in the back of your hands are about as shallow as you&#039;ll find, easier to see, and easier (for me) to hit.<br /><br />Use alcohol on the injection site- it will help minimize inflammation and tracks.<br /><br />Really, really consider if you should be injecting anything at all.&nbsp; Once you become accustomed to the feel of the steel, it WILL become your preferred method of administration, with potentially life-changing ramifications.&nbsp; Be safe, bro...<br /><br />
