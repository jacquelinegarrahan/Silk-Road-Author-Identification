				I work at a factory doing 12 hour shifts and the work is very physically demanding. When i come home all i want to do is fall on the bed and get a good night&#039;s sleep for the next day. But no matter how tired i am or how early i go to bed i still cant get to sleep until around 4am. It is starting to affect my work i am tired almost all day every day and yet when its come to actually trying to get to sleep i have had no luck. I tried cannabis, diazepam and many over the counter sleeping aids. The problem with them is that no matter how relaxed i feel or how ready my body is for sleep my mind just wont shut down. Nothing seems to be working, is there a drug out there that actually targets the brain and not the body or should i just up the dose on a benzo to say 20mg. Benzos seem not to be the primary choice as they make me feel even worse during the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ambien would be the best way to go but should not be used for long periods of time. The best way is to just use Ambien whenever you need to sleep and after a week you should get sleepy at that time without even taking Ambien.

				Well usually my routine consists of watching the news at 10pm and when it ends at about 1035pm ill then take either a 10mg diazepam or smoke a joint of cannabis. Around 11pm ill be in bed with a cup of green tea supposedly this helps, it doesn&#039;t. Its not the effects of these drugs that i challenge my body does feel relaxed/numb. But ill just lie there for endless hours until its time to get up or get fed up enough to go for a jog or something. I think it is definitely psychological that&#039;s why i want something that targets the brain and not the body.

You can use this to reset your sleep cycle, it really works!<br />http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-naturally-reset-your-sleep-cycle-overnight<br /><br />After fasting you should really aim to sleep whenever you want to sleep because once you reset your sleep cycle your body will get sleepy at that time from now on, you can use Ambien to aid this if you are still having problems sleeping. You can try OTC vitamins to help you like melatonin and drink it with some chamomile tea (not green tea).

				I&#039;ve had insomnia for years and tried all the benzos (very addictive and can be hard to obtain), OTC meds, herbs and melatonin. I recommend Mirtazapine (Remeron) it&#039;s an anti-histamine that is marketed as an anti-depressant/sleep aid. I take 15mg every night and I have a great 8-9 hr sleep, it also helps me feel a lot more motivated during the day. I also take MDMA, MXE, Methylone, LSD and other drugs and there are no interactions unlike other anti-depressants.<br /><br />Ambien is also good although it has some crazy side effects which I don&#039;t like.

				There are also a bunch of other anti-depressant&#039;s prescribed as sleep aids.&nbsp; Seroquel and Trazadone are a couple.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken both (they prescribe them in smaller doses than they would for use as an anti-depressant).<br /><br />I break a 50mg Trazadone in half and find it helps me get to sleep when I&#039;m having trouble and a 25mg Seroquel works as well.

				I take melatonin daily with great success. Not sure about the tolerance comment another poster made earlier, it works great for me.<br /><br />You can also take benadryl (diphenhydramine) as a sedative. They give you 50mg in the hospital if you have trouble sleeping.<br /><br />People also swear by Tryptamine&#039;s ChillPills, so I bet those are worth a shot as well.<br /><br />These are three alternatives to sleeping pills, benzos, and anti-psychotics.

				Zopiclone. Cheap, safe (unlike it´s relative zolpidem :D) and way less addictive than &quot;real&quot; benzos. I am usually pretty hard-headed for benzos, but one 7,5 mg pill of zopiclone puts me to sleep in 20 minutes. Also, it is not entertaining in anyway so you won´t just decide to skip sleep and wander off in to the lights of the city.

You know what melatonin is? It&#039;s the hormone your body produces when you&#039;ve been exposed to a lot of sunlight and then the light goes away... it&#039;s the &quot;bedtime&quot; hormone and it makes you sleepy. You know how you feel really tired after spending an entire day in the sun? Melatonin.<br /><br />You need to take a more significant dose, and just take it whenever you remember to. Don&#039;t double up if you miss a dose, because it doesn&#039;t work like that.<br /><br />I take 5mg. Seriously, go higher.

				No matter which drug you choose, you gotta cut the green tea. It has enough caffeine to make you restless for sure. If you must have tea, try chamomile but don&#039;t add sugar or honey. Damn, that sounded like MarthafuckinStewart. I&#039;ll stfu now. ;D

Ever since cutting it out of my diet I&#039;ve been much more wakeful. I had some accidentally once (punch with a little mountain dew mixed in) and it got me WIRED. Probably no more than 20mg and I was coked out. Seriously, caffeine&#039;s fucked up and you wouldn&#039;t even realize it because of how often everyone has it.

				Barbitutates are fucking awesome. When I was WDing from Heroin I took 2 and pasted out for 8-10 hours which I WOULD OF NEVER OF DONE WITHOUT IT! I would of woke up every 4 hours and take 30-60min to go back to sleep if I just took xanax. Xanax is nothing....Reds are where it&#039;s at!<br /><br />Ask your doctor about barbs. Those will work I feel.
