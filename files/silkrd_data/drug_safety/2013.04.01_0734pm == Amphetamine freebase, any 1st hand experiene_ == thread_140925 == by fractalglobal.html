				As a lot of the regulars of the amphetamine vendors thread know, quite a few people have had the idea of mixing amphetamine sulfate(speed) with (whatever) in a nasal spray unit.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at an alternative method.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done quite a bit of research, however unfortunately I can&#039;t find much information on the subject, and most of the information I do find is either wrong, or so simplistic as to be unusable.<br /><br />I am interested to hear if anyone here has attempted, or succeeded in administering amphetamine in its freebase form, by either inhalation or insufflation.&nbsp; I&#039;m after specifically first hand accounts.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen many people talking about friends(not SWIM acronym, real secondary perspectives) making &quot;adderall crack&quot; etc. <br /><br />As I understand, freebase amphetamine is meant to be caustic and therefore would damage the airways and/or lungs if inhaled.&nbsp; However, apparently synthesis of amphetamine only requires a PH of 10.5 to convert 95% to freebase, I was working with a much higher PH than that when freebasing DMT, and whilst its not the most pleasant experience in the world as far as vaping it goes, it didn&#039;t seem to be harsh enough to be causing damage.

				I have no first hand experience, so take everything I say in that context, but I don&#039;t understand why you want it to be freebase?&nbsp; I mean why not use the sulfate or hydrochloride salt instead -- it should have a higher bioavailability and be more stable for storage, etc.?

				Amphetamine hydrocloride&nbsp; is extremely hydroscopic, even if you manage to get it to crystalize at all it&#039;s a pain to keep it from turning into a gooey mess from absorbing water from the air.<br /><br />Sulfate is meh, its what everyone else has.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t purely a project aimed at increasing efficiency, I&#039;m also using it to learn a bit more about chemistry.
