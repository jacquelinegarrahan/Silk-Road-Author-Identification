				A 20-year-old Gainesville man who jumped through a window after eating psilocybin mushrooms was found naked and bleeding early Saturday morning near the Chipotle on University Avenue.<br /><br />After ingesting the drug, Nicholas Koster stripped down naked, jumped through a first floor window and then ran from his friends’ apartment at 111 NW 15th Terrace after they called 911, said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.<br /><br />Police officers found Koster on the west side of Chipotle at about 4 a.m., Tobias said. Koster’s back was cut from the broken window. Police did not arrest him.<br /><br />People who take psilocybin mushrooms often experience psychological effects, said Alfred Aleguas, a police officer and managing director for the Florida Poison Information Center, but physical injury can occur. He said people who purchase the drugs illicitly do not know how strong the drugs can be.<br /><br />“These are dangerous substances,” he said. “Those who take them should be locked up behind bars to protect the community.”<br /><br />source: ABC news

Not everyone gets the Hell trip. Back when I did drugs, I took LSD every weekend for 2 years, as well as mushrooms, and I had the Timeloop trip only twice. It&#039;s the same thing repeating itself foreever and ever. The trip lasts years in your mind. The only escape seems like death, unless you think you are already dead. I thought I was dead and in hell, so suicide would have been pointless.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never jumped out of a window either. But I can see it happening if you get the Timeloop hell trip.<br /><br />It&#039;s a very specific Trip that most people never experience on psychedelics.<br /><br />And it only happens in HIGH DOSAGES.<br /><br />People who tried to kill themselves on mushrooms or LSD were probably getting timeloops.

				That is where you are wrong, I have had time loop trips. I have had trips where reality shattered before my eyes and left me floating in a black void for what seemed like a lifetime. I have had bad trips where pumpkin orange faces were coming out of the walls.<br /><br />I even had an accidental trip where I thought I was eating 2x 1g chocolates and turned out they were 2x 4g chocolates. That one led to a deep trip and the death of ID.<br /><br />Maybe it was that I understood Yoda&#039;s answer in Return of the Jedi when Luke asks &quot;What&#039;s in there?&quot; and Yoda reply&#039;s &quot;Only what you take with you.&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Ill add that this feels like a flash back to the old Diane Linkletter LSD story.

				Surprised no one has made a Bill Hicks reference yet lol &quot;Always that same LSD story, you&#039;ve all seen it. &#039;Young man on acid, thought he could fly, jumped out of a building. What a tragedy.&#039; What a dick! Fuck him, he’s an idiot. If he thought he could fly, why didn’t he take off on the ground first? Check it out. You don’t see ducks lined up to catch elevators to fly south—they fly from the ground, ya moron, quit ruining it for everybody. He’s a moron, he’s dead—good, we lost a moron, fuckin’ celebrate. Wow, I just felt the world get lighter. We lost a moron! I don’t mean to sound cold, or cruel, or vicious, but I am, so that’s the way it comes out. Professional help is being sought. How about a positive LSD story? Wouldn&#039;t that be news-worthy, just the once? To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and superstition and lies? I think it would be news-worthy. &#039;Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we&#039;re the imagination of ourselves&#039; . . . &#039;Here&#039;s Tom with the weather.”

				Oh the irony in that last sentence: “These are dangerous substances,” he said. “Those who take them should be locked up behind bars to protect the community.”<br /><br />Protect the community of what exactly? When was the last time you got robbed or stabbed by someone on Shrooms or LSD? My guess is that they are protecting the community from starting to think outside the box and starting to reject the nanny police state most of us live in...

				I have been there more than once or twice, &amp; when I was there it wasn&#039;t fun, but.....<br /><br />Perhaps the eternal time loop, negative thought, mantra effect is a result of an inability / resistance to completely letting go of the ego, &amp; with it, your &quot;normal&quot; concept of time.&nbsp; Naturally, a minute can seem as if all time has slowed to a crawl, &amp; all of eternity condensed into a single endless second.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Making it through those &quot;hard times&quot; has made me forever grateful for what I was shown during said &quot;hard times&quot;.<br /><br />Buy the ticket, take the Ride-<br />Leggo My Ego-<br /><br />
