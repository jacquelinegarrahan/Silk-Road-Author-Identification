				Has anybody ever done low 2C-B doses? 10mg or less?<br /><br />I hear above 15mg you start tripping. Below that or 10mg it&#039;s sort of a light euphoric feeling. I was just wondering if anybody has experiences with this or can tell me more about it. The effects, how long it lasts. Some sites describe it as a &#039;very light XTC euphoria&#039; and I&#039;m wondering how accurate that is. Does it make you feel lovey dovey like E?<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t say above 15mg you start tripping. 10-15mg of 2c-b will provide the average person without tolerance a decent, not too overwhelming trip. I&#039;ve heard over 20-30mg can really suck balls and result in a lot of overwhelming and bad trips, depending on the person.

				I find &quot;very light&quot; and &quot;euphoria&quot; to contradict each other.<br /><br />Anyway, try it and let us know.<br /><br />Personally I like to trip and prefer higher doses of 2C-B but I wouldn&#039;t recommend more than 18mg for a first time user.

				I recently bought some 2C-B pressed pills that were said to be approx. 13-15mg each and wondered if just one would be enough or since I am new to the 2C family if I should start with half a pill?

				I&#039;m about 190lbs with a decent metabolism and I barely trip at about 25mg. I took 25mg about 45mins into the peak of 100mg MDMA and it made me roll for about 6-7hrs. Shit moved and morphed a little bit, but it was pretty chill. I&#039;ve never done LSD so I&#039;m def not experienced but it was easy for me to handle. It&#039;s different by itself...don&#039;t really know how to describe it...you can tell you&#039;re on something but it felt VERY controllable. I could see a small dose being very wavy..

				If your 2cb is good you will trip 10mgs + as a first time user I should imagine!<br /><br />Remember you can always take more but you can go back and take less

				I think one pill for your first time should be fine :)<br />2c-b in low doses is quite nice, similar to MDMA but more clear-headed and visually appealing. I think Shulgin said that it was a very nice &quot;museum&quot; compound. I will have to agree with that, since at low doses it&#039;s very manageable and enhances colors and perception considerably.

				In my opinion low doses of 2C-B are not like mdma euphoria.<br />If you go really low, like 3mg, there isnt much at all.<br />With 7mg you start feeling something but its more like the bodyfeeling of 2C-B. Sometimes you get hot and cold. Or you could experience some tingling and so on. You could also feel your mind getting a little bit further away from reality, more like calm and a little more thoughts.<br />I think it varies from one time to another, maybe you got 1mg more or less...well whatever<br />To get something out of 2C-B I think you need to go over 10. Under 10 it just lacks some things.<br />You also might be tripping with 10mg, or you just see some vague color enhancements.<br />I think zipstyle is right, one pill for your first time is completely fine.<br />After that you can work your way up, to where it gets really beautiful.

				I&#039;m still figuring out my perspective on the tryptamines such as 5-meo-mipt (and even shrooms) and the phenethylamines such as the 2c molecules.&nbsp; MDMA and MDA have the nausea on the come-up but I feel so wonderful on them.&nbsp; These other compounds which I suppose are artificial substitutes for serotonin and while the psychedelic effects are cool I just really dislike the body load.&nbsp; MDMA/MDA is so damn wonderful but depleting serotonin in the brain is only something that should be done every so often in my personal judgement.<br /><br />Taking MDMA before these other molecules seems to override their negative body load.
