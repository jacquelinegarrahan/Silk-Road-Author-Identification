				I&#039;ve tripped 3 times now. First time was 100ug, not really a whole lot happened though I probably did way too much weed. I was basically very high all night, but different from a weed high. It somewhat cured my alcoholism; drink seemed boring in comparison to that night.<br /><br />Next I dropped 180ug. Very in control all night, I got some patterning on objects happening, got fascinated with a brick wall, gravity changed direction, some colours changed. It was cool, but nothing too crazy.<br /><br />Third time I dropped 300ug. That was absolutely fucking insane. I was seeing alien plants growing everywhere, everything went amazing colours, objects appeared to melt, bugs crawled out of everything, it was nuts. But then at the peak of trips during it, I completely lost control of my body, was unable to move, and at times had very vivid and &#039;real&#039; feeling hallucinations. One example, I honestly felt like I had been abducted by aliens and was strapped to a table. I was still able to realise that it was the drugs, and this wasn&#039;t actually happening, but parts of it certainly weren&#039;t pleasant. A lot of it definitely was though in hindsight, and I had many personal revelations that have changed my views on many things.<br /><br />Is this kind of thing normal for a strong dose of LSD? With a different setting and mindset, would it be brighter and happier? What strength would be good for hallucinations and colours everywhere but not quite going into these deep trips?

				There are so many resources on the web on this substance. However I think 250 mics is the best amount for good visuals and maintaining some sanity, but you build up a tolerance. Large amounts all of sudden can make you pass out.&nbsp; I find you can take a couple drops one night then the next day its easy to go through 2 -3 and it wont be a strong as the first 2.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I don&#039;t like blotters good for posting out and dosing...but I discovered however when I vomited after a period hard usage, little bits of blotter where floating in the toilet. So either don&#039;t swallow thus losing some of the chemical or risk have bits of blotting stuck on stomach for days. Liquid drops is the best for regular usage - the way it comes on feels different too its subtle but nicer.<br /><br />I really like the 25i-nBOme I think its better if you just want to trip out on visuals and art and stuff, looking at things just makes you feel good. I&#039;m really warming to it. Each to their own.<br /><br />

				I would say not a lot is typical for LSD :) it affects everyone differently, and can affect the same person differently each time. based on dosage, you can gauge intensity, but you&#039;ll never predict experience. as far as your dose and intensity goes, i think that&#039;s on par, although i&#039;ve tripped with visuals on 1 hit, and every time i&#039;ve taken 3 i&#039;ve never had as intense a trip as you&#039;ve described... but i don&#039;t think it&#039;s strange.

				Alright cool thanks for the feedback. I have to admit I was a bit shaken after some of the stuff I felt and saw during the trip, but having done even more research, read heaps of trip reports, and had a chance to process it I am now looking back on the night much more favourably. I still think it will be a while before I take a dose that strong again, but I think next time I will go for 200-250ug. Its so much fun!<br /><br />I would love to get some drops, but they are quite rare and I imagine much harder to ship stealthily. The only listings I have ever seen here was one that was out of escrow and turned out to be a scam, then a couple always from new sellers with no feedback. Quite a big risk since its expensive.

				Yeah 300ug is a HIGH dose, especially for someone inexperienced.<br /><br />Acid&#039;s my favorite drug (possibly apart from mushrooms and mesculine), and I have to agree the liquid is MUCH nicer and cleaner than blotters. I usually find 200ug to be a good dose, although I take much higher doses at good parties/festivals. There have been a few big festivals where I&#039;ve taken 5 or 6 drops of liquid in a night, danced my ass off and let the music take my head to places I&#039;ve never been before.<br /><br />I used to DJ at psychedelic trance festivals, and have never played a set on less than 100ug of acid, the psychedelic nature of the music get&#039;s in your head like you wouldn&#039;t believe when your on a on a good trip, and allows you to take the crowd on a real journey.<br /><br />If you can find it (and afford it), I&#039;d definitely suggest buying a vial of liquid, store it in the fridge and it will last for years.<br /><br />Morphing<br />

				Liquid is the shit. Put it on a sugar cube, instead of waiting around an hour for your trip to start, you&#039;re tripping in 20-30 minutes because your body absorbs it much faster since it is designed to digest sugar not paper.

				The experience can be different for each person each time - your story appears to be somewhat out of the norm for intensity and subject matter so I&#039;d say it is a fairly good bet that with a different set/setting the trip should go much smoother next time.<br /><br />As far as dosage goes, it depends on the L. I usually take 2 hits worth of whatever I get (200-300ug depending) and then dose out a third to take after a couple hours if I believe I&#039;m up to it in order to test the intensity. If all goes well and it appears to be good quality L then I &#039;resume&#039; from where I left off (currently at 700ug).<br /><br />So have fun, my best advice is to buy it in bulk, test it out, and then explore using the same batch
