				Question is does cocaine *necessarily*, even the purest stuff, get crystally and crunchy when put under a lamp?&nbsp; Or is that just *usually* what happens.&nbsp; That&#039;s the behavior I&#039;m accustomed to seeing but this stuff remains totally soft and fluffy no matter how warm I get it.&nbsp; Got some stuff from a vendor that&#039;s different in several ways than what I&#039;ve ever had, and am wondering if I even got coke.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this sound like MDPV?

				to clarify this stuff isn&#039;t &quot;wet&quot; , it seems quite dry but it doesn&#039;t have any of that crystally texture, not even as fine dust.&nbsp; taking a razor blade to it just separates it, nothing &quot;crunches&quot; under the blade, not even a speck.&nbsp; it&#039;s soft like flour (not soft like play-dough).&nbsp; i&#039;m wondering if this actually proves anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;it does numb the tip of the tongue after about 3-4 minutes.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve never had that happen.&nbsp; Had plenty of moist blow in my day, buy a few minutes spread out under a heat source always dries it out.&nbsp; I would want my money back.&nbsp; Otherwise, you better get some baking soda.

				it came as a powder so it was either crushed or put through a screen first, I&#039;m wondering if that could cause this.&nbsp;

				I had coke like that once. Got it from SR vendor AfterHour (or similar name), a German vendor. This was long long time ago. It was really soft and fluffy, never seen yay like that. Also the effect lasted a lot longer than it should, yeah probably cut with speed.<br /><br />My advise: Dont do coke unless you go to Bolivia, Peru or Colombia. Not worth the money!

				Ah yes, impure coke.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bitched about this to anyone who would listen for years. <br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t have a weird smell to it. It might be that it&#039;s just not completely processed. Is it pure white? The choice is obviously up to you. Take a little bit of it and see if it dissolves completely in some alcohol (vodka is my preference). If it dissolves completely -it is slightly more reassuring because cocaine is alcohol soluble but lots of things are. <br /><br />Now take that little bit in the alcohol and drink it. Does it taste like cocaine?<br /><br />I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;ve encountered a problem like this before after dropping cash on an 8ball. You know what? I did it anyways. Perhaps it wasn&#039;t the smartest move but I wanted my money&#039;s worth. <br /><br />Ultimately, you will have to make the decision. If you do it; don&#039;t underestimate it&#039;s potency. If I was going to do it anyways (and I would) -do just a little bit and wait an hour. <br />

				Sorry, I just found this on the web<br /><br />clearnet: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-119217.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Unless you work at a Columbian Cocaine lab, your coke is not pure.In it&#039;s pure form Cocaine HCl is incredibly hygroscopic. This means that it absorbs all the moisture it can from the atmosphere. This property leads to the Cocaine HCl being a soft, wet paste.This paste is then cut, using different materials to decrease the purity of the Cocaine. Products used to cut Cocaine can include the following or even more esoteric crap:-Quinine-Lactose-Lidocaine-Procaine-Laxatives-Talcum Powder-Caffeine-Aspirin-Different powdered vitamins, including C and the B family-other active drugs, such as opiates or amphetamines1Finally the drug is dried, since it is no longer so pure as to have major hygroscopic properties, and shipped to wherever it&#039;s going.The next person who receives the Cocaine will likely cut it again, and so on down the line, leading the purity of any sample to be in question.Average purity can vary from 30-75, but usually averages to around 50-60 percent.11-Cocaine use in Amsterdam in non-deviant subcultures. Cohen, Peter.**Sorry, I just cut and pasted that from my phpFAQ entry.**So, anyways, those are the normal cuts, I&#039;m not going to look up there melthing points for you though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So it may be very pure and absorbing moisture out of the atmosphere. Approach with caution.<br />

				It&#039;s pure white and it has almost no smell at all.&nbsp; In the nose it has an unfamiliar almost stale leafy smell?&nbsp; But it&#039;s very faint and I can&#039;t really smell it unless I do a reasonable sized bump.&nbsp; &nbsp;No smell whatsoever of any wash or familiar coke smells.<br />

				Is it any good?<br /><br />There are a few cocaine analogues on the market -they often have 1/2 the potency of Cocaine.<br /><br />I know there are a few labs that will analyze your drugs for you -as part of the safe mdma movement. The service isn&#039;t free though. They will try to tell you what it is you are doing. <br /><br />Out of curiosity did you get the Coke here on SR?<br />

				Well, it gets my heart rate up to like 110 with a small line and it numbs strongly.&nbsp; But mentally I don&#039;t feel a lot, there is something there but it&#039;s not really an energetic feeling.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel talkative or anything like that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I will come out and say it now since I&#039;ve been trying to reach out to people who have ordered this stuff to see if it&#039;s the same, I got it from &#91;] last week, it was his ultra clean coke.

				He has got a good reputation and someone analyzed his Coke before as being mostly pure.<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please keep in mind that vendors change their product from time to time and quality may vary. Please treat the results as tentative at best, they are by no means a guarantee for what you will get. The cocaine is converted to a base before it&#039;s analyzed, so the maximum purity level is 89%. <br />...<br />Published on: July 11 2013<br />Tested by: PineappleLove<br />Vendor: Sukey<br />Listed as: &quot;Ultra-clean Cocaine&quot;<br />Purchasing method: Anonymous<br />Results: <br />87% Cocaine<br />No active cuts<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Even so, they could always put an adulterant in it. The nasty one that causes cancer is Phenacetin.<br /><br />If you have the money and inclination you might consider sending a sample in a capsule to:<br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/<br />For 140 dollars (US) they will analyze a sample. Dancesafe.org is working on a field test for this (but it&#039;s not available yet)<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br /><br />
