				We all use drugs, and sometimes we use some drugs more than we like. So what&#039;s your problem drug? You know the one you always find yourself slipping into.<br /><br />For me it&#039;s weed. I can regulate LSD, DMT, 2C-B all basically due to the nature of the substance. But weed for me is a pain in the arse from the moment I start smoking to the end of the bag. I just can&#039;t stop smoking the fucking stuff. Fucks my productivity up with work. I&#039;ll want to stay high all day.<br /><br />Silly really, but we all have a drug we run home too, what&#039;s yours?

				I actually crave weed more then I would coke. In all the times Ive done coke I have never had cravings on the comedown or a desire to do it again after (which is weird because I was told it was super addictive all my life). First time I did meth I wanted to do more after 3 hours but no physical cravings or anything, I just thought &quot;Wow this is awesome, maybe I should do some more to see how much higher I can get&quot;. Not &quot;Oh fuck I gotta get some more of this shit NOW&quot;.<br /><br />Ive done just about everything aside from most RC&#039;s, Heroin and crack. Weed has been my worst problem drug of all of them :-\

				Weed has become more and more of a problem for me lately. I&#039;ll have to take a break from it for a few months sooner or later :-\<br />I also almost developed a full-fledged addiction to MXE about half a year ago. Haven&#039;t used it since. Helluva drug.<br /><br />Never had any problems with uppers and downers. I don&#039;t seem to be prone to physical dependency but very prone to the psychological kind :(

				Weed.<br /><br />Holy shit, when I saw this thread I thought I was gonna be the only person to write weed, but her, turns out it&#039;s more of a common problem than I would have thought.&nbsp; I love cocaine, but I can pick it up or put it down.&nbsp; Weed, not so much.&nbsp; If I smoke a bowl, it doesn&#039;t take long before I&#039;m lost in it again, stoned 24/7 and terribly unproductive.

				I fuck with a lot of drugs, but the most problematic for me are weed and alcohol. When it comes to weed, I really need to moderate how much I smoke as if i get into an everyday pattern it can really have negative consequences for me. And alcohol, I can&#039;t control myself, one drink leads to 10 and I woke up the next day feeling like shit and full of regret.

				The only drug I seem to have no control over is Mephedrone, the most addictive stuff I&#039;ve ever encountered. So even if I&#039;ve been daydreaming about doing some almost every day since the last time, I just don&#039;t order it, otherwise I&#039;m fucked.

				I&#039;m really&nbsp; surprised to read these comments , My problem is weed for sure as long as i have it i&#039;ll keep smoking it and our prices for decent quality weed is insane ! so i find myself spending most of my money on that. As far as every other drug i tried i&#039;m fine with them all , never had problems with psychedelics / xtc<br /><br />Very interesting thread !&nbsp; 8)

				Amazing that weed comes up so often.<br /><br />I guess weed has little health problems, but lots of habit forming and productivity issues.<br /><br />2C-B can be a problem for me, I take it almost every other night if I have a stash of it. I know it builds tolerance, but you can do a run for a few days and then cut for a week. Because it is so short acting with minimal hangover. I&#039;ll take it in the evening just for the fun or it.<br /><br />Stopped buying it for a while now.<br /><br />

				Omg weed when I was in college. I have gone through as much as a quarter in a day ( which included making a couple firecrackers for myself). But its like I can just keep ripping bong over and over again and it never gets old. <br /><br />But recently I have slowed down on weed a lot like maby a g a week because I just don&#039;t have the time or desire to smoke. <br />Now I love mdma and wish I could do it more often but I&#039;ve been drinking alchohol a lot recently.

				I&#039;d really have to say alcohol too. It is addictive, and using it can causes numerous problems including simply drinking too much and have an unproductive next day as the result.<br /><br />I also smoke cigarettes in large numbers, but i have had little or no problem due to that. The short term effects of smoking are negible, although i&#039;m quite aware that it can kill me in the long run.

				N2O is actually a much bigger problem for some people than most realize.&nbsp; And it can be quite a detrimental one.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people go through tanks to the point where they are physically ill -- throwing up several times -- and then continuing to hit that shit until the tank is empty, even getting extremely hostile towards friends who try to get them to slow down or stop for the night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they are pretty ill for a few days following.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to lie, some of the most mind blowing experiences I&#039;ve ever had in my entire life took place with some LSD + nitrous, but I won&#039;t bother with it anymore unless I&#039;m in a situation where it can be controlled and I&#039;m on a psychedelic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously N2O is used in medical practice so in moderation it&#039;s not a problem, but if you feel yourself addicted to it, my best advice is to mentally lock it up and throw away the key.&nbsp; You will never &quot;learn the secret&quot; it seems to always come so close to revealing to you -- it&#039;s an illusion/deception.

				I had a problem with Heroin when I was very young. Nowadays luckily that problem has passed so I have no &quot;problem drug&quot; anymore. I can even use H sometimes if there&#039;s the need (also if it happens very seldom just because I&#039;m not attracted to it anymore, but I sometimes I use opiates to reach the typical &quot;opium dream&quot; state) without any harm.<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned many years ago that all the problems about addiction and dependence arise from your mentality and it&#039;s not for the substance itself. If you feel so attracted to a certain kind of substance in a way that you become a literal slave to it there&#039;s something in yourself that you sort of need to &quot;fill&quot; with that slavery. There are many typical junkies that I knew at the time&nbsp; that literally wanted to be slave of H, because they had nothing else outside of it. Heroin was their personal way to feel safe in that control (as the more instinctual part of your ego does with the Self every time). Full liberty and responsibility is extremely fearful and you begin to understand it well after certain type of experiences. <br /><br />Many people are addicted to other type of &quot;substances&quot; (completely legal and acceptable by society, but even more dangerous for their subtlety) in the same exact way for the same exact motives; religion (in the typical way the concept is adapted in many of the major perpetrators of it) is a clear example of one of these &quot;substances&quot;.

				Wow, when I started this thread I didn&#039;t think weed would come up so often.<br /><br />Interesting to read everyone&#039;s responses. It seems we all have a drug or class of drugs that we take more than we like. I take benzo&#039;s but have no problem picking them up and putting them down, same with MDMA, speed and alcohol. <br /><br />I avoid drugs that can be more chemically addictive than habitually addictive. Benzo&#039;s can be dangerous I know, but for me there is no big high. Thus I think that is why i can pick and choose them. But with weed I know I have a problem. <br /><br />It&#039;s like one big AA thread, anyone else want to share?&nbsp; ;D

				Well, some vendors like subsrgood, gotsitall, freeway, and from what I hear marlostanfield have some of the purest H on the road (when stocked) So if you are used to shit street quality gear, this will def rock your world! I would suggest waiting till subsrgood has some listings up tomorrow if I&#039;m not mistaken (vendor page info) and he usually has a 100mg sampler listing for like 32.00.. I just got some unexpected coin in, but don&#039;t quite have enough for a gram, so I myself might just go with the 100mg sampler, if he gets it.

				I am wondering if those who are addicted to weed have tried the budder or super premium category? Apparently the high is so psychedelic, mindfuck that you just don&#039;t wish to be screwed mentally again.<br /><br />It seems that milder, non psychedelic, normal weed makes you want to chase that high, but when you reach beyond, the high becomes quite frightening you don&#039;t want a second hit in a long while.<br /><br />Bro does opiates and is pretty in control. Also there are times don&#039;t feel like smoking. There are other interests in life right?

				Wow good topic.<br />#1 Worse is bud theres no serious adverse affects so there no reason to slow down(for me at least). So its the hardest to let go.<br /><br />Now the rest, all fall at about the same level but luckily I have some kind of will power because I really never use these any more. I never ever even felt withdraws because Ive always been careful and spaced out my really addicting drugs so that my body would not get hooked. Ive never IV&#039;d or IM&#039;d anything so that makes it a little easier for me. BUT I can not, I REPEAT I CAN NOT STOP thinking, dreaming, drooling, contemplating ordering, Meth, Coke, Crack, all opiates all of them H, Blues, Morphine... Ect. I think about them all the time I have the most vivid dreams in some I actually get a buzz when I use and in others its just a tease where I cant get high no matter how much I use worse part is the dreams are so vivid that I can see the drugs are top notch and they dont work.<br /><br />Ive even been fantasizing IV ing and IM ing all of these except crack....<br /><br />Ya Im sick lol<br /><br />But I stay away for my healths sake and for my family.<br /><br />Even though I fantasize I wont give in because I know where that will lead me. But damn I wish I could just flip a switch and stop my brain sometimes.<br /><br />I will probably have some H, Coke, and Meth every once in a while as a treat but no IV and no IM for these Ive mentioned above.&nbsp; Oral, Smoked, and sniffed only.<br /><br />Now IV ing IM ing K, DMT, L, MXE I might try these one day.<br /><br />And last but not least I have a problem with K and MXE also but again I space it out and sense its not as physically addicting as the others I dont worry to much about it. And the urge is no where near as bad as with the others.<br /><br />LOL wow I just reread this post before I hit post and damn this post screams addict! <br /><br />But like I said before I really never use these. I have used most of them all just a handful of time except for K, MXE, Coke, Bud. The other mentioned I could count on one hand how many times I used them but shit I cant stop drooling over them when surfing SR and when dreaming.<br /><br />Anyways Im rambling and no I am not high right now

				The only drug that I actually CRAVE is MDMA. I would do it every day of the week if I could. It&#039;s the only drug that makes all of my problems just float away; this is most likely due to underlying depression or something. But god damn, when I come down, it&#039;s the saddest moment of my life.

				WEED. I can&#039;t help myself, man my armpit sweat smells like straight weed....and sweat. I&#039;m gonna knock it one day, chances are once I become pregnant or when I&#039;m set up with a swanky job that pays well. Me and my bubba were once real bad adderall junkies, I never want to deal with that shit again. We&#039;d clean everything and anything, make shit, I don&#039;t know there was just never any sleep. That was a difficult point in my life though. One day I realized that I was growing up and the world was moving along whether I wanted to or not. Just freaked me out badly so I popped rewarding pills that made me feel like I had all of the control. Popped so many that the euphoria just stopped coming, a bunch of other shit happened and we quit cold turkey. Of course I can still get them at anytime, I just turn them into profit :)<br /><br />Still can&#039;t stop smoking weed though. It&#039;s so hard to let go...<br />I just don&#039;t want to stop smoking though. I&#039;m gonna be depressed whether they give me pills or not so I might as well forgo the pill treatment and smoke my weed.

				MDMA<br /><br />I don&#039;t use more than once a month, usually. But over several months, the medium length side effects persist. I can handle the mdma crash no problem (even when I&#039;ve done anywhere from .5g-.7g of SR quality in a night on a few different occasions). The crash for me is just being really tired and kinda lazy. I actually kind of like the airy feeling in my head the days after.<br /><br />It&#039;s the side effects that I experience around 2 weeks after I dose that last for a couple weeks and seem to last just a little longer with each passing month that get me. 2 weeks after I dose I get irritable and anxious and it lasts for a couple weeks. Then, once that full month break is over I finally start to feel better and get a craving to take MDMA again. It&#039;s been several months that I&#039;ve maintained this monthly routine and I can feel some depression creeping on. It&#039;s been a month since the last time and I&#039;m finally learning that even though I&#039;d really like to take it again, I&#039;m definitely taking a long break (shooting for a year) so that I can recover.

				Weed, but I would never call it a &quot;problem&quot;. Yes it has caused some problems (or I have, actually) like job losses, but for me these seem to be the worst side effects, and I have a job now. I&#039;ve smoked weed almost daily for 27 years, and 16 years of that was literally every single fucking day. Lately I have been more into the entheogens (I am looking at my DMT right now). <br />As far as a real problem, Xanax has been a great favorite, at times way too much of a favorite, hence a problem.<br /><br />Someone above mentioned psychedelics being self-limiting (my paraphrase); I tend to agree with this as some of the spirits or what/whoever you start talking with have really chewed my ass off - for getting high too much (I&#039;m not making that up, either).

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My &quot;problem&quot; is cannabis concentrates, though I don&#039;t consider it a problem (effectively making it a problem). One or two dabs used to have me fucking stoned for a few hours, now it&#039;s 5 consecutive dabs just to be high for an hour. Takes a full blunt to get high off weed, unless I take numerous bong rips of strong bud. I basically take anywhere from 15 to 30 dabs a day, totaling at least a quarter to half gram daily. I&#039;ve been constantly high off of THC basically since November of 2011, and don&#039;t plan on stopping anytime soon. I&#039;ve been a prime example of someone who can cope and handle everyday life while being high constantly.<br /><br />Methoxetamine fucked me up for a few days, but once I run out I never had an urge to re-stock. Fuck alcohol. Other than that no real problems.

				My problem drug is the common problem drug same as most people have already said. Weed. Thing is I&#039;m getting better with it though, from the beginning of this year up until today I&#039;ve significantly cut back with how much I consume within a single day. These days I only smoke out of bowls and keep it to a few hits a day, I still use it more than I would like to but I&#039;m just happy I&#039;ve gotten to a point where I can control my urges a bit more.
