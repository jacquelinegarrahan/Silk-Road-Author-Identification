				I&#039;m used to benzos;<br />Diazepam (Valium) <br />Alprazolam (Xanax)<br />Zolpidem Tartrate (Ambien)<br />Clonazepan (Klonopin)<br />Temazepam (Restoril)<br /><br />I know it&#039;s going to be a 1 off thing I just want to compare the recreational values of barbituates for myself.. Trouble is I don&#039;t know many of the brands etc so if anyone could tell me a good brand/type on SR that sells to the UK in small doses (only want to get &#039;high&#039; once probably enough for 3 people).<br />Also would be really helpful if you could guide me on a safe dosage (70kg). I&#039;ve read a lot of reports and 130mg seems to be common but it just says barbiturates so that&#039;s no help! :)<br /><br />Thanks

Also, you may find the following interesting:<br /># GHB<br /># 1,4-Butanediol<br /># Methaqualone<br /><br />Be careful, barbs are easy to OD on if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.

				Afaik the only Bariturat that still get prescribed in Europe is Phenobarbital (Luminal) and only for extreme cases of Epilepsy.<br />The typical dose for Phenobarbital is 1-3mg per kg for Pills and for im-injection max.100-150mg.<br /><br />Propofol+Etomidat arenÂ´t real Barbiturates and these will only applied trough Syringe drivers because normal Injection of those are extremely painful.<br /><br />Get some Phenobarbital-Pills and take for the first time max. 0,5mg per kg, also have someone with you who can keep an eye on you.<br />Without experience you should stay away from Injection-Solutions/Emulsions.<br /><br />Hope i could help you.

				I suppose they have been phased out for good reason really. The problem with barbiturates in general is that there isn&#039;t that big a difference between a safe and a dangerous dose. <br /><br />As for propofol: even when pushed into a running IV the sensation is very unpleasant, a nasty stinging/burning feeling. Normally it is used to induce narcosis for surgery, and you should be out cold within about 5 seconds of beginning administration. It also has amnetic effects, so you may not even remember that much about it being administered.<br /><br />While it is very effective to induce complete anesthesia, i would recommend against trying it recreationally. In a hospital setting you are already connected to heartrate, blood pressure and ventilation before it is administered. This makes is much easier to detect the effects of too high a dose, and also makes stimulant and defibrillator access much more rapid if anything were to wrong. <br /><br />Things like GHB aren&#039;t without danger either, but at least they have the benefit that you can slowly self-administer them, preventing you from taking even more after a large doses passes you out. This may seem like a bit of an odd argument, but it has some merit. Try drinking yourself to death in one go: that will not work when you pour yourself a shotglass at a time, because you will be passed out on the floor before you can ingest a fatal dose. GHB as a similar limitation if slowly ingested as the liquid, whereas something like propofol is irreversible after injecting it and could result in death with no means to do anything about it. <br />
