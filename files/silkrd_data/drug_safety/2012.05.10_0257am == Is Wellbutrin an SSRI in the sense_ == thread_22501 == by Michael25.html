				Technically I read all over that Wellbutrin is not an SSRI. Confusing as it is, will this particular drug block any effects of MDMA or similar you think? I think maybe Dopamine may have a big part in this.<br /><br />&quot;Wellbutrin is different because it isnt an SSRI it is an aminoketone. It is believed to balance the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It is frequently is prescribed to people with ADHD as well as depression. It has a stimulant effect so thats why it is also used to treat ADHD and why it is different from other SSRIs.&quot;<br />

				It varies from person to person how much Wellbutrin affects your roll. Some people say it doesn&#039;t at all. Some say they still roll but don&#039;t get the full effects. Some say they just have to take a bit more. But it is nothing like an SSRI where you cannot roll at all.

				What about LSD and Wellbutrin? MDMA? I have a dear friend who has a prescription for 300mg Wellbutrin daily, and she would love to experience these drugs again but is afraid they may mess with her prescription. Any advice?

				Disclaimer: I am no doctor. These are just my personal experiences and some things that I have read. Everybody is different, start slow and find out what works best for you.<br /><br />I had great trips on mushrooms, LSD, and DMT while I was prescribed Wellbutrin and SSRIs simultaneously. SSRIs are supposed to lessen the effects of psychedelics but they did not in my experience. Wellbutrin has no effects on psychedelics. She should be fine. In regards to MDMA, I addressed that in my first post.<br /><br />The only thing is never take ayahuasca while on either of these types of medication. The MAOI in it can really fuck you up. Serotonin syndrome can kill you. <br /><br />Oh and I think I remember reading that SSRIs + DXM is very dangerous, but fuck DXM anyways haha.

				Wellbutrin isn&#039;t a SNRI or SSRI, its a Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. With very little effect of 5HT receptors.<br /><br />Being so it&#039;s likely to have more of an effect with cocaine and amphetamines, and not much with LSD/DMT. It will likely make amphetamines more potent, so be vary careful as this may cause increased cardiac stress. If your blood pressure is already high, Wellbutrin will likely increase it, and DMT with high bloodpressure is very dangerous.<br /><br />With all this said, everyone reacts very differntly to almost everything. Be careful when combining anything, start slow to gauge how you react. Not tripping as hard as you want far better then ending up in the hospital or dead.<br /><br />This is not medical advice, just my two cents.
