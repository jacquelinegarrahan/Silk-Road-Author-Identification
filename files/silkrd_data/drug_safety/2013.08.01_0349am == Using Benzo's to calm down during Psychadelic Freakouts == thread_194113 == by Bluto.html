				A long time ago, it wasn&#039;t that I was having a bad trip or anything but my friend gave me some Valium while we were coming down from Acid.<br /><br />It was relaxing and a nice end to the trip.<br /><br />Now some literature I&#039;ve been reading is suggesting that it was making me come down sooner than what I thought it would -which is fine.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m planning on a 2C-B trip and was going to have a few Xanax on the side &quot;just in case&quot; -I need the calming effect.<br /><br />I&#039;m not finding a lot of information on this particular combination. <br /><br />If I take Xanax while I&#039;m tripping on 2C-B; will I instantly come back or does it simply have the calming effect of a benzo?

				in my experience benzos kill my trip pretty quickly. i have never tried them when using 2c-b or any 2c for that matter so i wouldnt know if it was that would be safe or not. It always nice to have a few extra bars laying around to help you end a nice acid trip or to shut the fool up that couldnt handle his shit.

				I took an overdose of philosophers stones (truffles) once and started to freak out, so I took some olanzapine (anti-psychotics) and the trip was aborted, mercifully, within 30 mins!

				Benzos more or less kill trips. You won&#039;t be sober. But anxiety, headspace, duration, and all other positive and negative effects will be greatly reduced. I recommend only taking them during a trip if you really need them, and even then it is better to try and work through the emotions instead of killing them with a pill. You have to be ready to deal with things that you may be unconsciously suppressing on psychedelics, and they can be painful on the way back out. That is one of the beautiful, healing aspects of psychedelics though, bringing those issues to the forefront and being able to deal with them.<br /><br />That being said, I almost always have a benzo on hand while tripping, although I haven&#039;t needed it in a while. I find a good friend/experienced guide is better than any benzo.

				Rick Doblin of maps.org suggests that small MDMA doses would also be highly successful at circumventing bad LSD trips when they crop up as an alternative to benzos. Although their research hasn&#039;t progressed to that point yet!

				Although I have not had a lot of 2C-B experience, I prefer it on the light side as far as doses. Sasha Sulgin called the minimum dose that could be felt but not noticed by others (that you&#039;re tripping) a &quot;museum dose&quot; as he apparently went to museums while on psychadelics. 16mg was the museum dose for 2C-B, and my first tries were with 18mg. I had later took some 28mg caps and had the same amount &amp; duration of psychadelic effects, but a bit of a stomach ache for the first 1-1,5 hrs. But I have never been much on amphetamines or similar compounds because of the body loads. <br /><br />2C-B isn&#039;t likely to cause a bad trip (IMHO) as the effects are almost entirely visual - everything had a rotoscoped look, like the movie &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;.

				I had a buddy go to the medic tent at a festival (from taking waaaaay to much L) and they gave him an IV of ativan.&nbsp; He calmed right down&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s are most definitely good for this purpose.&nbsp; Good to keep around if you cosume a lot of psychedelics regularly.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard benzo&#039;s colloquially called &#039;landing gear&#039; because they&#039;re great for zonking out after tripping for twelve hours instead of laying awake another six to eight.

				How about MDMA, will it kill a roll the same way?&nbsp; If for some reason someone is having a bad roll, I have no experience rolling so curious about this should I try it..

				I think TommyGun is mistaken and thinks that &#039;rolling&#039; refers to being on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Rolling refers to being on MDMA.&nbsp; Tripping is being on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Although technically MDMA is a slight psychedelic.

				Dunno if i&#039;m right, but I would have thought that combining LSD with MDMA could be a recipe for disaster. I have no experience with this combo however.
