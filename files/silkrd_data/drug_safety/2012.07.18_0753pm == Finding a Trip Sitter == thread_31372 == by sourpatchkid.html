				Title: <strong>Finding a Trip Sitter</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Finding a trip sitter seems to be the most difficult task for me. <br /><br />Let me explain my situation a little. My friends and I are all pretty new to the psychedelic scene. I, myself, have only tripped on three separate occasions so far (at different times this summer). My first trip experience was with four of my friends (however, only two of us tripped while the other two got high). So, technically, we didn&#039;t have trip sitters since our friends were not sober by any means. My&nbsp; last two trip experiences have been alone at my house, without a trip sitter, which turned out fine (all of my friends freak out when I say I tripped alone because they think it is extremely dangerous).<br /><br />For my next trip, I would like to be able to go outside and go to different places around town instead of being stuck in my house, so I will need a trip sitter (since I shouldn&#039;t drive and just for safety reasons in general). HOWEVER, it is nearly impossible to find someone who is willing to trip-sit. Most of my friends don&#039;t want to trip-sit and would rather just trip with me (which means there will be no trip sitter), while the other portion of my friends are against our use of psychedelics in general and don&#039;t want to be responsible for us while we are tripping. <br /><br />So, what do I do in this scenario? My tripping friends don&#039;t want to sit out when there is an opportunity to trip, and I don&#039;t think it is necessarily a good idea to just trip with my friends without a trip sitter. What good would that do if no one can drive?&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, I don&#039;t want to have a trip sitter who has never tripped (and doesn&#039;t ever want to) because they wouldn&#039;t really be able to understand/empathize with what I&#039;m going through while tripping. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone can even give me advice on this, besides finding cooler friends, so I guess this is mostly just me venting my frustration.

				@Knomo:<br />When you trip alone, what do you do (if you don&#039;t mind me asking)? I like tripping alone, but like I said above, that usually means tripping inside my house. I want to go out in nature, but I&#039;m not exactly in a rural area with a bunch of nature around. I feel like driving could pose as a problem while tripping :P

				There are some, but not in walking distance. I could just walk around in my neighborhood and in the surrounding woods, but the thought of seeing people I know while tripping unsettles me. I&#039;m not the best at communicating normally while tripping. My social skills while tripping are that of a child :P

				^^ i know how ya feel man. i was so sketched first time i had to talk to somone i knew while tripping. but... idk. it just flowed. comfort will come with time. IMO the more you trip, and the more comfortable you get with the whole thing the more you can learn,. you can explore more without sketchin

				haha, yeah. I think I just need to get used to it more. I probably *think* that I&#039;m worse at communicating while tripping than I actually am. I mean, I was a trip-sitter for two of my friends, and they seemed to carry on as normal (besides their amazement at everyday things). <br /><br />Ahh, the beauties of tripping :)

				unless being drunk as shit and pretending to trip sit counts. idk. alotta people ask me to trip sit then when they dont need it. my trip sitters are usually people on lower doses. Haha. I have helped calm a few people down while on higher doses than them though. Sometimes i just get into that divine advice giving state of mind where I am able to truly help others. Idk how i did it, but i talked a girl out of a freak out on shrooms. Salvia is another story. No helping the ones who loose it on that shit haha.

				Personally I&#039;ve never had a sitter with me when I trip, and it&#039;s always turned out fine. In fact I prefer it this way, sober people tend to get in the way and annoy me with their linear thinking and judgmental attitudes.<br /><br />I think a lot of people say you need a sitter because a) it&#039;s better to have one and not need one than need one and not have one, and b) for every one person that is &#039;strong&#039; enough mentally to keep their shit together, stay safe, and avoid a bad trip/panic attack in public, there are probably 5 people that can&#039;t, so this is safer advice for the masses.<br /><br />Everyone is different though, so if in doubt er on the side of caution and bribe your friends for sure :P

				If you know thee is a dose at which you do not, entirely do not, need a sitter, then take a tiny bit more than that and don&#039;t use a sitter. They mess with the purity of the experience, keeping you hanging halfway between unless you&#039;re in control enough to overcome the effect.<br /><br />The more you do it, the better you get at it and the more you can take without a sitter. Don&#039;t degrade the experience with a sober sitter just to get ahead - enjoy the journey and work up to exploring everything you want to.

				Well, I&#039;ve taken both a 125 ug trip (first time) and 250 ug trip (second time), and I felt fine being alone both times. Even though I am fairly new to LSD and tripping in general, I feel I am able to control the direction of my trip very well. I actually prefer being alone because, like you stated, they keep you &quot;hanging halfway between&quot;. Personally, I don&#039;t want that type of distraction during my trip because it will make me feel like I have to behave more normally. And what&#039;s the fun in that when tripping on acid?&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Thanks for the advice you guys!

				Behaving normally works directly against the point, as it&#039;s well known that behavior affects mood and consciousness. Force yourself to smile when you&#039;re sad, you start to cheer up. Of course, if you&#039;re at a level of control where that&#039;s not an issue, I highly advise the delights of interacting with sober people who can&#039;t tell at all that you&#039;re tripping while your headspace is undamaged by their presence.<br /><br />In my experience, good clean LSD doesn&#039;t reach &quot;tripping&quot; until around 400 mcg. Before that is a wonderful state called acid high, which I find much more clear headed and psychedelic than a weed high, removing you more from regular reality while leaving you more functional than stonier cannabis strains. I define tripping to start when my ability to interact normally starts to dive. Once that changes, I dunno how I&#039;ll define it, but for now it&#039;s that, and it usually comes around 400 mcg.

				ahh, wow, that is cool to hear! Maybe I have only experienced an &quot;acid high&quot; and not actually tripping. The way you have described it is exactly how my trips have been. I guess I&#039;ll only find out the more I start to experiment with different doses of this awesome molecule.

My favorite ones even seep into my memories so that I feel as though I&#039;ve been acid high since I was born and eating 6 hits is like eating a burger, meaning you do it to function normally not abnormally. I love it when I reach that stage and I just think &quot;Yes, this is how my brain is supposed to operate.&quot;

				It makes me feel like an explorer, the way I think everyone who&#039;s knowingly explored uncharted lands must&#039;ve felt. The last time with my friends, it burst out of me (after preceding ramblings about the future) - &quot;We&#039;re priests!&quot;<br /><br />Of course I didn&#039;t mean the first thing that comes to mind with that word. I was envisioning another time, another world where priests were hardcore spiritual explorers, pretty badass and well respected for both outlook on life and level of capability in the physical and spiritual planes.<br /><br />Damn I wish Lucy were here right now.

				&quot;Spiritual explorers&quot;--I like that term. That&#039;s definitely why I like psychedelics so much. I feel like it&#039;s a beneficial experience that I actually gain something from. <br />It sucks though... like having friends who have never tried it and are against it. It&#039;s frustrating because I know if they tried it they would learn so much from it, and it would be an important experience for their lives (I&#039;m not into forcing anyone to do anything against their will/desires, so I don&#039;t push it). But I don&#039;t see how one could trip and NOT learn from it. Even with a bad trip, I think there is something to be gained from the experience. <br /><br />I hope Lucy finds her way to you soon!&nbsp; :D
