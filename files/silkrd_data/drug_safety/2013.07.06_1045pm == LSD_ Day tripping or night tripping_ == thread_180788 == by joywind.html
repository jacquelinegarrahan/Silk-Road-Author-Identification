				There are 2 reasons why I would prefer tripping at day: <br />1. I have a fear of darkness since I&#039;m a child. Especially people sneaking up and attacking me. It&#039;s not that dramatic but we all now acid can make everything scare the shit out of you. I feel safer at day :)<br />2. I hate it when I get kicked out of my normal sleeping rythm, it takes a whole week to go back to normal.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll try night tripping once, haven&#039;t done it yet.

				There are a lot of things I prefer to do during the day, LSD is not one of them. I like taking it around 8-9pm so I&#039;m still tripping at 4am in the morning, if I&#039;m with friends we go walk around outside while everything is completely silent and there are no cars on the road, its utter bliss. I also don&#039;t like being around, or seeing people when on acid (or shrooms) unless they are close friends. It freaks me out and I get the paranoid feeling &quot;Shit am I acting normal? I wonder if that person thinks I&#039;m on something.&quot;<br /><br />I only took acid during the day once though... compared to dozens of times at night. I took 400ug of it a while back and went out to run some errands and do my shopping, I also got on a bus absolutely full of people during rush-hour when I was trying to get home from shopping. I walked into a coffee shop near where I live after and stood right behind two cops in line smiling to myself at how funny the whole trip was going.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I regret about that trip was the strange look the lady at the head-shop gave me. I went there to buy a pipe, and I had spoken with her before when I had been in there. She knew me fairly well and I must have looked off to her (could have been my pupils or the fact I was having a hard time formulating sentences haha) because she gave me this alarmed look, then awkwardly smiled and didn&#039;t say much to me afterwards.<br /><br />The whole thing was fun as fuck though, watching the floor of the bus bubble and turn into goo on the bus ride home. Should have brought sunglasses with me...<br /><br />

				Sun rise on any psychedelic is magnificent...<br /><br />Did 6g of lemon-tekk&#039;d shrooms at 1am then watched the sun come up around 6am while still tripping balls 8)<br /><br />There was a glow around the sun as it came up and all the colors that were flowing off of it gave me a head-gasm if that makes any sense<br /><br />

				Day tripping&#039;s great if you want to maintain your normal sleeping schedule. But night tripping is more... mystical.

				It depends on what kind of trip I am gearing up for. Have you ever been in the mood to want to see how scared you can get on a trip? The night time is A-1 for that but ordinarily I love to take cid in the mornings

				Its all good :) day trippin and night trippin ... Like Rastaman said night trippin is more mystical I usually get stalked by shadow ppl ;), but I love trippin durin the day time, all the light and colors and activity is awesome for me + I get crazy visuals 8)<br />Sunrise and sunset is a must experience on a trip, watchin the sun melt into the earth is crazy. I saw a sunrise once with a group of about 15 all trippin, the sun was about 100 times bigger than normal and everyone saw the same thing ;)

				Night tripping:<br />I absolutely *LOVE* closed eye visuals. I see them the best when I&#039;m in pure darkness, and can flash a light for a few seconds to trigger a change in the visuals.<br /><br />I can see them in the daytime too, but only if I stare directly at the sun so that I have a near-white backdrop. Getting a black backdrop at night is just easier.

				Ahem... Yes.<br /><br />Seriously though, anytime I take acid, it&#039;s a truly WONDERFUL experience.&nbsp; Can&#039;t go wrong with it. :P

				i like doing it around 4pm so i get some day light and then darkness. I like the darkness because I feel safer because everyone else is sleeping and or wont be calling me. I fear a day time trip that someone might come over or call, night i just feel like I am more alone. Also during the day time all the colours can almost hurt my eyes. A perfect sunset into the night is best, plus i get to sleep around 2 which does not throw off my sleep pattern much.

				Take a higher dose of lsd, 300mcg or so around 4 pm so that you&#039;r still tripping by the time the sun goes down. Thats my favorite way of doing it.

				Tripping during the day is just amazingly beautiful and you always get such positive vibes. I feel it would be literally impossible for me to have a bad trip during a sunny nice day. <br /><br />Tripping during the night is like being in a very strange world. I like it too, but I generally prefer the beauty of day trips. Only downside of day trips is the fucking cars. I fucking hate cars when I&#039;m tripping.

				Day Pros:<br />-Sun = bright and happiness<br />-Clouds = kaleidoscope<br />-More to do<br /><br />Night Pros:<br />-No non-tripping people awake<br />-When there are fewer light sources they are more dramatic<br />-Don&#039;t get tired<br />

				After so many people writing positive things about night tripping, I tried it out yesterday with a friend. We both took 3/4 from Light of Pi&#039;s 130µg tabs (had them before, they&#039;re very good) and laid down on a meadow. Man that was some beautiful shit! We were listening to trance/techno music while watching the stars and airplanes above us. As we started tripping we saw more and more stars, even the very tiny ones and they seemed to dance to the music and forming shapes. <br />I saw a low flying airplane and it was like a ship sailing through a sea of dancing stars, leaving a trail of light behind it. We even saw some shooting stars, my buddy thought one of them fell down near us and he got up to search it ^^<br />Later we went to my place cause it was getting cold. I turned up a black light lamp in my room and we listened to music all night long. My friend was scared cause he saw some monsters on my walls but I calmed him down. At around 5am we went out to see the sunrise. We saw birds flying around leaving colourful trails and trees with perfect oval shapes. You could feel the perfectness of nature and it was like you were at home and a part of it. Very beautiful. Thanks for the inspiration everyone :)
