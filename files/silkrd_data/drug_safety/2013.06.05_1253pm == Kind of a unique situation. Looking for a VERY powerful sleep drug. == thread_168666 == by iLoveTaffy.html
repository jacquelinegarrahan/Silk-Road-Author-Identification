				What should I get on here? I use opiates, but I&#039;d rather not use heroin to sleep. I&#039;d rather use it for pain while I&#039;m awake, and for the high.<br /><br />Benzos really don&#039;t help me sleep. I&#039;ve tried so many. Temazepam doesn&#039;t work either. I haven&#039;t tried Etizolam, but if 1mg = 10mg of diazepam, well, I&#039;ve had a gram of diazepam and barely slept....<br /><br />Is there anything else you guys have tried successfully? My insomnia is very severe. Nothing natural works (including marijuana). So, suggesting Valerian Root, or even melatonin, is pointless.<br /><br />Any of you in the same boat as me? &gt;_&lt; I wish I could sleep... <br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear success stories of meds... I&#039;m looking through SR, and I just can&#039;t decide on anything. =/<br /><br />Thanks guys.

I would rather sleep. I&#039;ve only taken a dose that high once. It didn&#039;t work, so it&#039;s pointless to continue.<br /><br />But see, in order to wake up, you have to sleep. I have been known to frequently stay awake for over five days in a row without even a nap. No, I do not use stimulants. I do not even use caffeine or sugar. <br /><br />One cup of coffee and I WILL be awake for at least 6-8 days. I do not know what to do. v_v I guess I will just start using heroin to sleep twice a week. Better than staying awake for a whole week.<br /><br />The only drug I know of in America is Lunesta (eszopiclone), but my insurance won&#039;t cover that (pretty much the only damn drug it doesn&#039;t cover... for real? -___-), so I&#039;ve never tried it, but as it&#039;s basically as strong as Ambien, I don&#039;t even care to. Zopiclone isn&#039;t approved in the USA, but why bother with that when we have eszopiclone anyway, which is still pointless.<br /><br />Meh. <br /><br />Thanks for the quick reply. Really appreciated. Here&#039;s hoping someone has a random beneficial cure in some odd drug. =/ Imagine if I had a paradoxical reaction to meth and it made me sleep instead? Hahaha....<br /><br />But for example, I&#039;ve been awake for over 80 hours now... Think I&#039;ll insufflate a bag or two of deez&#039;s heroin and try to sleep. Sleep doctor appointment tonight. Again. Pointless seeing that girl, lol.

				I have troubles off and on with insomnia as well.&nbsp; Fortunately for me benzos do work as well as ambien.&nbsp; Oxazepam really knocks me out.&nbsp; Benzos are not all the same so I wouldn&#039;t rule all of them out for you just because valium didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; However, they will be habit forming and you don&#039;t want to get yourself addicted to benzos for sleeping either so I wouldnt recommend going that route for a long term solution.<br /><br />One thing that oddly works for me (something you probably don&#039;t want to hear) is getting sober.&nbsp; After a week break for me from weed, alcohol, caffeine, and any other substances I start sleeping really well usually once again.&nbsp; I can never stay this way forever but it can be worth it just for a few nights sleep every once in a while.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m really interested in trying Oxazepam, hooby. I&#039;m not entirely ruling them out, but I have been on a few. Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, Restoril, and then the non-benzodiazepine Ambien.<br /><br />StExo, I&#039;ve been really interested in GHB. I asked BG a question about it, but I think I&#039;ll ask here too:<br /><br />Is it at all like alchol? I&#039;m allergic to it, and other than that, I HATE the effects because of the nausea. Will I have to worry about any of that with GHB? If not, I&#039;m buying it today.<br /><br />Thank you, guys. Thank you.

				Zopiclone works for me if I only take it periodically. I develop such a tolerance so fast that I really limit when I take it. I sort of work shift work so I have a messed up schedule which often makes it impossible to get a decent recent.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that keeping your bedroom /sleeping area tidy and predictable helps. Wear a mask. Use earplugs. Be cautious with opiate use to sleep. I&#039;d rather deal with the tiredness than increase my opiate use to where I&#039;m nodding, ymmv of course.

				What AussieMitch said, many times over. <br /><br />I am curious to hear what sleep medicine had to say. Did she do a PSG/sleep study? <br /><br />If you&#039;re awake 80 straight hours without stimulants, if you&#039;re using opioids, the other thing that occurs to me is the possibility of microsleeps (from lack of slow-wave sleep and/or direct opioid effect), then being &#039;off-cycle&#039; and being unable to sleep. That&#039;s when something for wakefulness might make sense, but the sleep eval would be required. <br />Given your reaction to caffeine, etc., it seems like you might be more sensitive to sleep changes than the average critter.<br />Opioids are toxic to sleep architecture, so piling them on for sleep is likely to backfire.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming you and sleep med already talked about this, though.<br /><br />Just heaping different stuff on for sleep, when you haven&#039;t been able to induce sedation with a heroic dose of benzodiazepine, is unlikely to work. <br /><br />What are you doing while you&#039;re up for 5 straight days without any interruption?<br /><br /><br />Abstracts edited as I can&#039;t follow up. Someone PMed me on this and then deleted their account. Re PM me.

				Man, you should completely eliminate ALL drugs from your life for a while, substances will only provide a short term solution.<br />The only long term solution is to be active during the day, e.g go for a run, go to gym, go on walks, go and see your friends, go on a bike ride etc.. this is the key for a good nights sleep, trust me. The more energy you burn off during the day, the more rest you need.<br />Then when it comes to night time, set yourself a sleeping time of say, 11pm. Make sure you attempt to sleep from this time everyday. <br />Set your alarm from the same time everyday as well, 8 hours is the optimium amount of sleep for most people so set your alarm for 7am, and make sure you get up at this time everyday. Without fail. This will sort your body clock out.<br />Improve your diet by eating more vegetables and fruit, with less junk and processed food. Start taking mulitivitams. This will sort your insomnia within a few weeks at the most if you keep it.

				+1 gtgeorgz - this is what we think.<br /><br />not to give you some rehab shit talk, but EXERCISE. <br /><br />Regular high aerobic excercise for 30min + a day or 4 out of 7 days WILL make an amazing improvement in your sleep, life, feeling and happiness.<br /><br />Sounds like BS but you WILL notice.

				Here are the meds I&#039;ve tried:<br /><br />Diazepam, clonazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, seroquel, trazodone, and more I&#039;m sure. <br /><br />I can&#039;t exercise due to health issues, but I do what I can (leg excersies inside, walking as often as I can). I know a LOT about medication (and the chemistry of it), it&#039;s just that I simply can&#039;t find anything beneficial.<br /><br />No, 30mg of temazepam doesn&#039;t work. 300mg doesn&#039;t even work. My thoughts travel at the speed of light and the only way to slow them down is with opiates. My sleep archetecture was fucked even before I started drugs. I started drugs FOR my sleep. I&#039;m prescribed 120 10mg pills a month, and I get more on here. It does WONDERS for my anxiety (and I mean WONDERSSSSS), but nothing for my sleep.<br /><br />While awake, I usually work on my organic chem work and screw around on my iPad. I will take a few bumps of heroin to slow my brain down every once in a while, but I don&#039;t often take enough to even get close to nodding. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried bromazepam, but with the doses of benzos I&#039;m taking, I am really iffy on whether or not they will work. I&#039;m solely taking 40mg of diazepam a day now because I see no reason to take more. I&#039;m using it for anxiety ONLY pretty much, since it will not help me sleep.<br /><br />I still think I&#039;m going to test GHB. Hopefully that&#039;ll help. If I could even sleep one or two days a week, I&#039;d be so happy. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on a LOT of different antipsychotics looking for sleep. I&#039;ve been on every single atypical antipsychotic except Godeon, and I&#039;ve been on haloperidol too. Nothing works for me.<br /><br />I can&#039;t get a sleep study because my insurance won&#039;t cover it. I was just in to see the doctor about it today. I can take higher doses of heroin, and that helps me sleep, but I don&#039;t want to go down that path. I like where I&#039;m at now. I have no opiate addictions or dependences. If I do that, I WILL become dependent on heroin and I do not want that.<br /><br />Thanks for all of the suggestions, guys.

				GHB might work - i suppose its worth a try as long as you are aware of the risks. <br /><br />Just one thing i&#039;m curious about: You seem to have tried a lot of prescription and illicit substances to help you sleep. How do you react to good old alcohol, as in drinking a bottle of vodka? Does that knock you out at all? <br /><br />Obviously i would not suggest drinking a bottle of vodka every night just to be able to sleep, but on the other hand it seems worth trying just to see if it works at all at least once. Also, it should not be combined with any other sedatives like benzo&#039;s for safety reasons, but despite all that it would be interesting.

				I cannot have alcohol. Even a single shot of vodka will make me barf. I THINK I said that in the OP, but I&#039;m not 100% sure. My reactions to medications are very weird. I&#039;ve tried pretty much everything available in America EXCEPT Lunesta, and Lunesta isn&#039;t going to work where everything else failed. <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of getting some GHB from BlueGiraffe and trying roughly 1-2g a night and see if that relaxes me enough to help me sleep.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty sure I understand the risks of GHB, but could you reiterate, if you have the time? If not, I will go search the clearnet. Thank you, Ben.

				I did not see you could not use alcohol at first glance, but if you cannot, its clearly an option that is not available. The upside is that you do not need to worry about alcohol-drug interactions either. <br /><br />The risks of GHB are fairly well documented on clearnet, though accidental death without the combination of alcohol is very rare.<br /><br />It would be an interesting drug to try though: Since you seem insensitive to benzodiapines, it could be that your GABA-A receptors are for some reason different, while the GABA-B ones may be completely normal and hence sensitive to the effects of GHB. Determining anomalies in these receptors would be a very costly endeavor though, as it would probably require genetic analysis.<br /><br />

I asked BG a question about it, but I think I&#039;ll ask here too:<br /><br />Is it at all like alchol? I&#039;m allergic to it, and other than that, I HATE the effects because of the nausea. Will I have to worry about any of that with GHB? If not, I&#039;m buying it today.<br /><br />Thank you, guys. Thank you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The affects are some what similar to alcohol but its unlikely you would be allergic to you. Your body produces its own so its near impossible. GHB is really your best option, it will put absolutely anyone to sleep even narcoleptic&#039;s. Its also the only drug that will let you go through your natural sleep cycles so it will be quality sleep. If you only use it for sleep you will not become dependent but maybe psychologically addictive. What StExo said about having to redose is true depending on the dose you will wake up in about 3-4 hours but a redose will put you back to sleep. As for none GHB options a very sedating hypnotic benzo like nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, lomtrezepam, or a higher dose of temazepam might help. If all else fails buy the strongest barbiturates you can find on SR.

				There are drugs that will make you sleep. But your doctor will not prescribe them to you. <br /><br />Take enough phenobarbital, and you will sleep like you are in a coma (you basically are). Phenobarb actually allowed me to sleep through a good portion of MAJOR opiate withdrawal - and sleep is something that just doesn&#039;t happen during WD. <br /><br />The &quot;twilight&quot; drugs they give you before surgery can put anyone to sleep. I LOVE me some fucking Versed! Propofol, the drug that killed Michael Jackson, would do it. He had extreme insomnia too, that&#039;s why he was taking it. But no doctor is going to prescribe Propofol for insomnia. Well, no doctor that is not being paid millions by a Hollywood superstar, that is. <br /><br />There is a bodybuilding supplement called Phenibut that I adore. If you take a couple grams of it, you will sleep like a baby. You&#039;ll also have really vivid dreams, which I like. Phenibut actually gets you extremely fucked up if you take enough. I take a couple/few grams of it, but it&#039;s different for everyone. It&#039;s a lot like GHB, but lasts longer and to me is a lot more pleasurable. It comes on really slowly, though. It won&#039;t exactly knock you out - you just get really tired a couple hours after taking it, and want to go lay down. And you go to sleep pretty easily (it takes me hours to go to sleep if I don&#039;t take anything). <br /><br />There are plenty of drugs you can try instead of getting addicted to heroin. I forgot what you posted that you have already tried, but Ambien should let you go to sleep if you don&#039;t already have a tolerance to it. Lunesta works well, too. But those drugs will only work for a while. There&#039;s Trazadone, Mirtazapine, Seroquel (I believe that enough Seroquel can knock out anyone - it takes a lot more for some people than others, but if you just keep upping the dose eventually you will turn into a zombie and pass out on the kitchen floor). I&#039;m currently taking Mirapex for Restless Legs Syndrome, and it makes me pretty drowsy (I&#039;m a serious insomniac as well. I&#039;ve been up for about 36 hours as of right now. But I&#039;m taking my Mirapex, some Lyrica, and some beta blockers, and I&#039;ll be down pretty soon and for a good while. So just keep asking your doc to up your doses or try something new. The way doctors work is that you have to try all the stuff they give you. And if you give it an honest shot and it doesn&#039;t work, they&#039;ll give you something else. If you keep taking what they prescribe but nothing works, they will move on to more hardcore drugs. But you have to try all the other ones first. If you keep on trying what they give you and it doesn&#039;t work, it is possible that your sleep doc will eventually (I mean waaay down the line) prescribe you some kind of industrial strength med like Phenobarbital, or maybe even some Tramadol or low dose Buprenorphine or something. Depends on how cool your doctor is. They have the power to prescribe stuff &quot;off label&quot; and will if needed. Just keep working with your doc and doing what he says. He knows how destructive insomnia is, and he&#039;ll keep trying until you get better. But you have to give all the mild stuff a chance first.

				Mirtazapine! Remeron. Yes, I&#039;ve tried that too. 15-45mg, nothing. I&#039;ve been up to 600mg of Seroquel, nothing. I know there are drugs that are guaranteed to put me to sleep, but I don&#039;t see them on SR.<br /><br />I might just try some barbiturates if the GHB doesn&#039;t work. Do you have a suggested vendor? When I was going through severe Xanax withdrawal, the only thing that would put me to sleep was high dose oxymorphone. <br /><br />I use opiates for pain, SEVERE pain (another reason why I&#039;m awake.

I&#039;ve tried everything and, in their words, &quot;Anything else would be to destructive.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, well, I think being up for 5+ days is quite a bit more destructive, wouldn&#039;t you say? When I get to 6~7 days I&#039;m almost dead, at 8 days I actually FEEL dead. I haven&#039;t been up more than that.<br /><br />I would love to try Propofol, and reading about MJ&#039;s death, I kept thinking &quot;Damn, I want some of that...&quot;, but I wouldn&#039;t feel safe on it alone. GHB or Phenobarbital it is.<br /><br />We shall see. Also, I&#039;ve tried Tramadol and every opiate they&#039;ll prescribe. The stronger opiates work. Benzos do not. 30mg temazepam or 300mg, it&#039;s not going to put me to sleep. The most I&#039;ve taken is 10 30mg capsules, but it affected me the same as 1. *sigh*

It will probably be 3-4.5g maybe a little more since you seem to have weird reactions.

If used responsibly and not 24/7 its a very safe drug and if used right can be used long term with some 2-3 week breaks. If your in the US i strongly recommend the vendor FOREVERJUNG, his stuff is very easy to dose because its a carefully dose liquid and his shipping is the best i have seen by alot. Multiple seals and very carefully packaged.

I think either would be perfectly fine i just always try to avoid customs. I think you should be able to go for 1-2 months maybe more between breaks. You should start slowly maybe do your taper up without any breaks until you find the right dose. If you were able to taper within two weeks than stay on that dose for another week, stop for 2 weeks and go back to just below what you found to work like .5-1 g and than if that works stay with it, other wise taper up again but it should be within 1 gram from your first successful dose. Than go back on the working dose for one month with 2 one day breaks just to make sure you dont get any withdrawal symptom at all. Take a one week break and than go for two months or so. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions and i wish you the best of luck!

(Or is Jung&#039;s the sodium salt too?)<br /><br />Either way, I do not want liquid for many reasons. I want the pure powder myself. Much more accurate dosing and quality is more easily judged. Thank you for the recommendation. <br /><br />I don&#039;t plan on using it 24/7, I plan on simply using it for sleep. Based on your suggestion for 2-3 week breaks, how many days in a row can I likely use it in your opinion? I will judge for myself when I get it, of course, but something to work off of is always beneficial.<br /><br />Thank you, guys.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No its K-GHB, I have heard alot of good things about bluegiraffe but i have never used him so i cant speak personally on that. I think either would be perfectly fine i just always try to avoid customs. I think you should be able to go for 1-2 months maybe more between breaks.

I figured might as well try it now, and I didn&#039;t want K-GHB, I want Na-GHB. Thank you for your help, friend. I&#039;ll shoot you a PM if I have any questions for sure. Thanks!
