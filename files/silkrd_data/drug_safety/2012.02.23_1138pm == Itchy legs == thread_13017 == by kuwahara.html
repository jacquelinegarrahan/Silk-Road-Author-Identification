			<dd class="postbody">
				I have recently been suffering from itchy legs...sometimes arms too.&nbsp; I am wondering if it is related to any type of drug/comedown/withdrawal.&nbsp; It may of course be something totally unrelated, but I am very healthy apart from my narcs and have no known or visible skin complaint.<br /><br />The drugs I take are:<br /><br />Caffeine - a lot.&nbsp; Just coffee/tea, but I drink it all day at work.&nbsp; I thought this to be the most likely cause.&nbsp; Have cut down and not cured.<br />Alcohol.&nbsp; I am heavy end of social.&nbsp; Drink way more than I should, but not anything like alcoholic level - though I do have binges.<br />Cocaine.&nbsp; Not all the time and not that often, but had some recently at similar time to this, though even had symptom when not had any for over a week.<br />diazepam - however, bought from topix forum, so not sure what is in it.&nbsp; Slight worry that this may cause side effects.&nbsp; Again had symptoms even when not taken for a week.<br />Nicotine - random and usually when drinking.<br /><br />I have started taking some B vitamins and even tried to reduce wheat from diet, but this feels like something is wrong...it is worrying.<br /><br />I have cut down all of the above for a week and it has reduced the problem.......<br /><br />Anyone ever had similar symptoms and know any links to above drugs?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
