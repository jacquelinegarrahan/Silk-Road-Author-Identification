				they do not sell ketamine were im from and ordering from SR would sadly not be an option<br /><br />a friend told me that its actually &#039;really easy&#039; to make. she says she went to a local veterinarian, not some big chain, and managed to get some liquid ketamine. after this she says she just dried it up using a hot plate and boiling water to obtain the crystals.<br /><br />my questions are, is it really this simple? how good would the quality be assuming i followed the process flawlessly? any specific brands i should look for, or lookOUT for? any tips/recommendations or alternate practices would be much appreciated.<br /><br />ketamine is scheduled right? so if i want to take back like 5-10gs on the plane i would get totally busted ?<br />cheers all

				You&#039;re asking two different questions. do you want to synthesize ketamine from &quot;scratch&quot; or are you talking about drying liquid K out to make crystals so your can snort it or whatever?<br /><br />Yes, drying K out is pretty simple. Synthesizing it is not.

				im not sure about the difference&nbsp; :-\ , care to briefly explain?<br /><br />so basically my question is, if i have access to liquid ketamine (which i assume i can buy from a veterinarian or a pharmacy where im from), would i be able to make it snortable? if so, how?<br /><br />thanks !

Either use some oven mitts and open flame, pour the liquid into the pyrex dish and move it around over the flame. Mircowave oven(not recommended) , dish under a heat lamp over 2 days. Just be sure how ever you do it, not to burn the cook up. Once the liquid &#039;frosts&#039; over it is just about done, after the &#039;frosting&#039; it will begin to buble and almost crackle, it is done. Good luck!

Wha I explained is the way you make already produced ketamine snortable.
