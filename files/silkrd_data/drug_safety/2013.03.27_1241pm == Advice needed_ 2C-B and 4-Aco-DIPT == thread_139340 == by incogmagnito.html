				Hello,<br /><br />I would like to ask people in the know if 2C-B and 4-Aco-DIPT are soluble in vodka and if they will deteriorate if I do it. I have an LSD vial and I would like to keep these compounds in similar form ... Unless it destroys them.<br /><br />Many thanks.

				So 2CB you should be fine with in some liquid suspension, not sure about 4-Aco-DIPT though. Neither really benefit from the process though. 4-Aco-DIPT in particular seems to like being in a cool dark place, which 2CB gets along with pretty well with too. If you keep the powder in vials in the freezer, you&#039;ll want to be careful of condensation when you take them out. For me, amber vials on the top shelf somewhere seem to do the trick pretty well. I doubt you would destroy the stash by diluting them but for 4-Aco-DIPT at least it&#039;s a bit of an unknown so I would just avoid it or try it with small part of your supply and see how that hits after a few months... the powder in the amber vials will still be fine.

				@DiamondSky, thank you.<br />Yep, I keep them in the freezer now sealed and with silica gel in the baggy, so should last forever.<br />Sounds like I will try with 2CB and will be careful with DIPT as I also have very little of it.<br />

				Yeah let us know how it works out a few months from now. I was seriously debating dilution for 2CB since it&#039;s sort of a pain to measure out but ended up getting some milligram measuring scoops from Amazon that seem to do the trick pretty well for me. Got one with some vitamin powder I ordered that&#039;s 12-15 mg per scoop and it checks out on the scales I have so it falls into the good enough category for me. 2CB is pretty forgiving compared to 4-Aco-DIPT.<br /><br />Both of these are more potent snorted vs. oral though and it&#039;s a lot easier to get the liquid in than to get it back out.

				Ok. I think I will go for it on 2CB ... What is your concern with 4-Aco-DIPT? Do you think it will react with ethanol or it might deteriorate because of water or impurities in vodka?

				I haven&#039;t stored it in liquid myself its just that early reports on the stuff claimed that it was extremely absorbent and reacted to moisture in the air by turning clumpy and discoloring. Just got me thinking that either the sample they had wasn&#039;t very clean or the stuff might not react well to liquid. 2CB I can drop in liquid and it just dissolves nice and clean over a couple of minutes or with some shaking. If I were going to do it, I would probably take 10-20mg and drop it in a little vodka and freeze it. If it clumps up in the liquid that would be a pretty good sign that you don&#039;t want to suspend the stuff since you need it fully dissolved to know what dose you are going to end up with.
