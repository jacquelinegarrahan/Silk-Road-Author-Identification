				What is this? How does it compare to crystal meth or anhydrous (biker speed)? <br /><br />What the best way to use it? base it on foil? glass dick pipe? Can it be snorted? or is it wet like real &quot;paste&quot;?<br /><br />

				In Europe, speed is generally supposed to mean amphetamine and not methamphetamine. Amphetamine salts are the active ingredient in Adderall in case you know these. <br />Illicit labs normally produce amphetamine sulfate which is sometimes sold as a paste. This paste will dry quickly once exposed to air, and is then snortable. You can also ingest it. It can NOT be smoked. <br /><br />Some people (and the wikipedia article) are claiming the paste is still containing some amphetamine freebase and is not dry for this reason. However amph freebase is an orange liquid (see http://oi43.tinypic.com/15mh5hg.jpg ) I think it&#039;s more likely that it&#039;s just a solvent left over from synthesis. After all if you leave some liquid in the product it weighs more... <br />&nbsp;<br />

				Okay, so its effective if free based? <br /><br />Also, is the threshold the same as adderall? Could I add the dried poweder to my mdma gel caps for a bit of an uppy roll? 100mg of both?

				as I wrote:<br />it can NOT be smoked.<br />You can not put in on foil or pull baking powder shenanigans. The sulfate will burn and have no effect (besides a sore throat).<br /><br />How many mg you need depends of course on the quality of the product. <br />100mg of pure amphetamine however would be an overdose for most people, so i&#039;d try to start with less.<br />Note that combining it with MDMA will most likely intensify the side-effects (teeth clenching, sweating etc)<br />

				Thanks guys this has been a big help! I was expecting it to only be effective in larger doses due to the very low price. If it is 1 gram wet, how much can I expect the weight to reduce after drying?

				how was the drying process messy? Id like to avoid any loss, i was thinking of using a warm glass plate to spread it..<br /><br />I have been crunching the numbers and.. it appears I will be getting paste around 45%. So what would be a could gel cap ratio for a solid speed boost. would 50mg gelcaps of amphetamine suphate be worth 10$ a piece? 5$ a piece?<br /><br />Or would 80mg of pure mdma be more noticalbe/enjoyable with 20mg of amphetamine sulphate powdered?<br /><br />I understand if these substnace are often too diff for good feedback. I just dont want to spend a long time working my tests up to perfect dose, if i can get a good starting point. <br /><br />thanks again, I love i can ask with no haha for me seeking info

				I ordered a gram to check the &#039;dutch paste scene&#039; out. Let it dry partially and parachuted it with a friend, we each had half. I found the detrimental after affects to disproportionally correspond to the speediness, and decided I prefer meth in my speed. It was fun but not fun enough for me to order lots more.

Very uncool I know but reliability is just a huge issue on Silk Road. <br /><br />At this moment the most potent and best amphetamine/speed paste I&#039;ve bought here is from a German vendor Der Speed Doktor. The price is about 16 btc for 5 grams and that is very reasonably priced for the quality you get and it&#039;s is even free shipping also to the U.S. Everyone who has used the speed paste of Der Doktor is very positive about the effect and potency you can also read that in the speed/amphetamine topic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I ordered from Amsterdope. He shipped promptly through escrow and delivered pretty much as promised, and with good packaging, so I&#039;ve no complaints about him as a vendor. I just didn&#039;t enjoy the product as much as I hoped to.

				@That 1 Dude:<br />it was messy because the innermost plastic bag had burst. So a lot of stuff was smeared all around the wrapping. I probably have not lost much anyway. Just wanted to tell you why I can&#039;t give you the exact weight.<br />You don&#039;t need to warm the glass plate. I used one at room temp and It dried in minutes. <br /><br />&gt; it appears I will be getting paste around 45%<br />You cannot know and you will never know the percentage of amphetamine in your paste unless you have access to a chromatograph. Dealers just pull numbers out of their ass that sound not bad but not too good to be unbelievable. Or they quote numbers as told to them by their supplier, those numbers have most likely been generated by the same&nbsp; ass-pulling technique. Even if there&#039;s a reliable test for one&#039;s dealer&#039;s product he might have switched suppliers in the meantime.<br />If you actually get pure amphetamine salts (e.g. adderall) the dosage you suggested sounds reasonable.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest just taking the MDMA first and snorting small lines or bumps of speed once the MDMA starts going until you are happy with the effects.<br />Just remember the speed needs some minutes to get to your brain so wait a bit after dosing each time.<br /><br />@davebowman<br />half a gram each at once? seriously? of a drug of unknown potency and content you ordered off the internet? this is..... brave.<br /><br />

				All of the tests of European speed that I have seen on this forum show that speed paste is frequently cut with caffeine, in some cases lots of it.
