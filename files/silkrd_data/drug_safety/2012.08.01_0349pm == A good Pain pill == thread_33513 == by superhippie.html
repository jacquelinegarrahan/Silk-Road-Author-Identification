				The best in my eye&#039;s are Opana&#039;s and next being Oxycodone but both are very addictive and Opana&#039;s are pretty dangerous so use with caution and enjoy the nod :).

				I&#039;d go with roxy 30s, it&#039;s essentially a percocet without the acetaminophen - just pure oxycodone.&nbsp; It&#039;&#039;s stronger than norcos, but you can crush it and snort it so you could always start low.&nbsp; Much better than norco in my opinon

				Try one 50mg tramadol. You&#039;ll other love it or hate it. For some, its SSRI/SNRI effects combine with the weak (codeine level) opioid buzz to form a warm blanket effect of sorts. A few report speedy effects that wake them up and keep them buzzing like oxycodone. The rest, especially those with a serious tolerance, won&#039;t feel shit.

				I second sourman&#039;s reco, tramadol is a good place to start if you&#039;re new to opiates, it can be super enjoyable. But NEVER take it if you&#039;re on any kind of anti-depressant (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, anything with SSRI or SNRI effects) b/c it can cause serotonin syndrome, which can kill you.

				^^I should have noted that, good catch and +1 for you! Yeah, tramadol doesn&#039;t mix with anything seratogenic which includes LSD, shrooms, DXM, and most RCs I would think.

				I only like trams I they&#039;re with a benzo. Also allows you to cross the seizure threshold. Still dangerous taking two downers

				Tramadol with a Xanax works wonders for me. Be careful if you&#039;re gonna mix pills instead of taking just one.

				Tramadol sucks, it&#039;s barely stronger than codeine, and often makes you extremely nauseated. It&#039;s only good for pain relief.&nbsp; It is a selective mew-opioid receptor agonist -&gt; i.e. it does not give any of the pleasurable effects of opiates because it only binds to mew-type opioid receptors.<br /><br />Has anyone ever had OxyNorm? It&#039;s capsules of pure oxycodone powder in an instant release formulation. <br />I have a few in stock myself actually, check out my profile if you are interested (link in sig). <br />They are pretty special and quite rare to find.

				Most people without a high tolerance can certainly feel tramadol, especially when taken with fatty foods. You either love the feeling or hate it though. The opioid effects are preceded by a serotonin/norepinephrine spike, which is great for people feeling down, but can make those who feel more &#039;up&#039; nauseous and dizzy like you said. The later category usually enjoys tramadol with benzos, which lower the seizure risk associated with taking too much (or mixing tramadol with seratogenic drugs), and also keep serotonin levels from rising to uncomfortably high levels in general.

				The OP stated that he uses hydrocodone and norcos so switching to tramadol would be a complete waste.&nbsp; He wants to switch to something stronger not weaker.&nbsp; If you can get off on tramadol then more power to you, but again OP, I would go with perks or roxys.

				The OP said &quot;Im into pain pills (vicodin,norco ect.) im just wanting to try something new&quot;. Tramadol is something new. <br /><br />Some people love it despite the fact that it&#039;s weak as an opioid. It has effects that go beyond that. Then agian, others hate it or don&#039;t feel shit off of it at all. I&#039;m just saying try it, don&#039;t actually switch to anything unless it helps you. If the OP only takes 10-20mg of hydrocodone a day, they may very well enjoy the opiate effects alone. It&#039;s really not as weak as some think, that is if you&#039;re lucky enough to be affected by it at all.
