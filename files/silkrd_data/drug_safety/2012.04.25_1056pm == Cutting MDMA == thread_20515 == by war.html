				Alright, first off let me start off by saying i&#039;m DEFINITELY not trying to buy pure MDMA on SR and then cut it with a bunch of baking soda and resell it for a ton of profit.<br /><br />What I am interested in however, is what would be good to cut my MDMA with for personal use.&nbsp; I was thinking possibly mixing caffeine (for when going to a festival/party), 5htp, vitamin C etc...<br /><br />What would be the most beneficial thing to mix into my gel caps (if anything)?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!

				Lol....you are going to try and cut it a little bit aren&#039;t you? :P<br /><br />And you don&#039;t cut MDMA at all, it&#039;s not like coke or speed.

				Crushed up tums?<br />Though still better to take that before...as with most things. There isn&#039;t too many supplements you can mix with it that would help at the time of taking it, only other drugs that you would like to mix with it.<br /><br />

				haha no really, theres no point in me cutting it anyways considering that no one i know can tell the difference between 100mg and 500mg&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />At a festival a few weeks ago I had a friend of mine buy ORANGE molly and asked me after why it was so awful... hmm I wonder why&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Sometimes i chug a 5 hour energy when I swallow MDMA but was just wondering if anything would make sense to add into the extra room in my gel caps.&nbsp; Cutting up TUMS and shoving them in doesn&#039;t make too much sense, I can just eat those before/after/during.

It does work within a few seconds, so mixing it in would not be too bad. I know some people who are OCD enough to fill the rest of their capsules with something, it might as well be something useful.<br /><br />Wow, I sure do use a lot of commas when I&#039;m high.

				Im still a bit confused of MDA vs MDMA honestly.<br /><br />MDXX seems to lump in a whole lot of RCs such a 5/6.<br /><br />I may try mixing in a small amount of 25i but it seems to me that it may be better to try that a few hours before/after MDMA.&nbsp; I guess I just have to convince myself that theres going to always be some extra room in my caps that I cant fill with nutrients/more drugs :)

MDMA is a step on from MDA<br /><br />MDA is more speedy than MDMA and has less body roll but is more psychedelic whereas MDMA is less speedy more euphoric/body roll and less psychedelic. Together you get the yin/yang effect. The whole bonanza!
