				So I got some shrooms a couple months ago, vacuum sealed. I left them vacuum sealed for ~1.5 months because I was waiting on a drug test that took forever to happen (not for shrooms, I wanted to smoke weed during the trip). I tripped and had a pretty good time, it was my first time. It wasn&#039;t amazing. I only took 1.5 and felt pretty confused. Anyway, after opening the vacuum seal I put them in a zip lock bag for another month. They&#039;ve been in the dark the whole time. They are in a mason jar now. When I moved them, they were sort of fuzzy, and there looked like there was some sort of mold growing on them. I&#039;m not an expert. Should I exercise caution?<br /><br />TLDR shrooms are a tad fuzzy. will i die?

Any mycologists here to tell us if something like that is possible?

				the mushrooms probably absorbed a little moisture over time (or were never completely dried) and mycelia started growing off the base of the mushroom in search of another food source. <br /><br />Cubensis can do this, mycelium grows off the mushroom itself onto another food source, colonizes then grows more mushrooms. They should still be safe to eat.<br /><br />to the above poster it&#039;s not that spores germinated. Mycelium grows very easily from mushroom flesh. This is how cloning works, you take a piece of mushroom from a desired fruit and put it onto agar to isolate it. Technically you could grow more mushrooms from the mushrooms you buy on here using this method, and most of the time they will have traits similar to the original clone.

I didn&#039;t know they can start to grow again when exposed to moisture.

				Yeah, even dried fungal matter isn&#039;t really dead. It&#039;s tissue can still be used to obtain an isolate. It can be hit or miss though ie not work 100% of the time.<br /><br />I have had shrooms in the past that I thought were completely dried, absorb a little moisture over time and occassionally get a bit fuzzy. Probably what happened here.

				That fuzziness is just mycelium and can be rubbed off easily. Mycelium is not poisonous so no worries.
