				Shes super freaked and literally all she has taken in the past 90 days in .25mg of clonazepam and 5mg of hydrocodone?&nbsp; Any chance this would actually cause her to fail.. seems ridiculously low...

				The hair test is the most accurate test for drug use.<br /><br />What is this test for?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure it shows the frequency of use and the amount?&nbsp; If I remember correctly the metabolites your body creates after consuming the drugs gets caught in the hair follicles and it&#039;s embedded in the hair.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just what I know, I may be wrong.

				More info please?<br /><br />How long ago did she take each thing? When is she taking the test?<br /><br />Some shampoos are purported to help, maybe look into that.

				Not being funny, but whats to prevent someone who takes drugs shaving all of their off just before the test? Would a hair test still be able to take place?<br />I was just thinking if you don&#039;t want to fail, this could be a reasonable compromise. ::)

				Its for employment, in the last 90days ALL she has taken is 1, .25mg clonazepam and 1 5mg hydrocodone.&nbsp; Seems too little to fail to me, but all I can find is threshold in ug/ml or whatever, need some sort of chart that actually shows use levels to pass.. if any exists.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine that taking one prescription drug in 90 days is a fail..<br /><br />

				If that&#039;s ALL she&#039;s taken, she&#039;ll be fine. The levels in her hair would be much too little to detect for &quot;drug use&quot; even if they&#039;re using a gc/ms.

				If it was for a dude I would say cut your hair to about an inch. but I guess that won&#039;t work. When I had to take hair tests was the soberest period of my entire life.

				My speculation is that since in test is testing use over a 90 day period, approx 1.5 inches of hair closest to the scalp. A single small use would probably not bring you over threshold. I have no data to back this up however.<br /><br />I would check to see what labs are nearby, what their standard tests are. I know that specific labs near me will test for things others might not in a standard test. Point being, tests vary some from lab to lab.
