				use one of those things in a button down shirt... in the collars- the plastic tab.<br /><br />or the flat end of a fine pair of tweezers....anything thin and flat enough to clear the Ubie&#039;s outer toob.<br /><br />gotta go in about 2&quot; so you&#039;re at the center of the ubie....it&#039;s made for loading weed/tobacco herbalz...haha<br /><br />so when i smoke any bases / oils / hash, i take this into consideration and prep the ubie pretty well. you have to.<br /><br />you need something thin to scoop up a nice pile of it, and with precision, dump it into the center of your ubie and plug er up.<br /><br />hold that lighter no closer than 1.5&quot; for a few seconds and slowly wave it under your base. watch for state change and vapor capture and gently pull.<br /><br />blast off. be careful as large piles of DMT can liquify rapidly - and you should hold the ubie slightly downward as this state change occurs, continuing to vape / heat as needed - to avoid it dripping into your face. :D<br /><br />L75<br /><br />ps.<br />as simple as the ubie is, you can&#039;t be a gorilla using it. I have tried many times sloppily and failed wasting a lot of money.<br />I have learned to be precise with putting stuff inside the outer tube - and to hold the flame very far away. you&#039;ll be amazed at how powerful convection and airflow are, using just you and the ubie.<br />This thing can make you feel like you just ripped a 2 foot bong hit out of a piece of hash the size of a pin head.<br />It&#039;s so efficient - I have to use it for expensive chems and bases. Weed I smoke out of a glass bong. I do not use the ubie for it, although it&#039;s cool and that&#039;s what the ubie&#039;s sold for (uh huh).<br />

				hmm.. I have always just smoked my dmt out of a bong but this sounds like it might be a better way to go.&nbsp; especially if you can smoke hash with it too I guess I&#039;ll have to pick one up.<br /><br /><br />Just need BTC to go up like 50 cents so I can afford one with the coins in my account&nbsp; :P

				For getting DMT into the ubie I use a common drinking straw ans I cut the straw in half leaveing a spoon on the end of the straw and I simple insert the straw and flip it over so the DMT falls right in the sweet spot of the ubie. :D<br />nomad bloodbath<br />

				This also has me confused... When heating, a solid should go through a liquid phase before a vapour phase right? And even if you do end up with a load of hot liquid, surely if you let it sit at room temp it will recrystallise, or if you heat it more it will vapourise?<br /><br />I personally have a glass Eagle Bill vaporizer, I have some DMT but have not tried it yet.

It&#039;s important to let the Ubie cool between large hits of DMT.<br /><br />All you need is like 10-15 seconds of 1-2&quot; regular lighter flame (no torch) slowly waved under the big tube.<br /><br />if you hold the flame close for a long time, Ubie gets black, DMT will liquify or solidify (brown residue) you &#039;<br /><br />instantly skip the&nbsp; vaporization threshold and never get a hit. people don&#039;t realize it takes very little heat for <br /><br />this stuff to&nbsp; activate. less than weed. this happened to me because the freebase i got was so fine and <br /><br />crystallized. I had to be science-class careful with the stuff. Once I watched closely for state change, i&#039;d <br /><br />remove the lighter, and allow the heat of the outer tube to work on the base. got a thick ass pull. If you <br /><br />breathe out a nice vapor cloud, you should - at least 5 seconds later, be on Saturn with your head mounted <br /><br />on an alien arachnid. Hopefully you have more base to experiment with my man, sorry that happened. Your <br /><br />mate sounds like he got liftoff though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Wait, what? the dmt is NOT supposed to liquify?? everytime we have attempted it it liquifys immediately! <br /><br />and no.. i make sure to do my best to put it in one spot.<br /><br />And i have a gram of walters stuff.. so yes.. i have much more ;)?<br /><br />I&#039;ll try again soon-ish.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />my bad on the confusion....the DMT does turn to liquid just before releasing vapor, but you should be very careful not to let it drip, hold the Ubie <br /><br />perfectly flat if you plan to keep heating it. Arutha makes a good point of maybe letting the DMT cool and recrystallize. I did in fact do this a few times-<br /><br />letting the liquid solidify and recrystallize....half was clear, half brownish. After taking a break from tripping face - and would go back to hit the Ubie <br /><br />only to get a doubly huge cloud of a hit and trip harder, again...lol<br /><br />You have a whole gram of the Walter? :D u lucky dog.
