				Heya guys i finally got some pressed pills. Unfortunately I don&#039;t think they are MDMA pure. Please can i get a second opinion, First and foremost it looks like http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=30064<br />I did three tests marquis mandelin and mecke. Here are the photos of the pills and results of the tests.<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=65d564128d48f5a258ec2c1183b99b74.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; Pills<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=1fb2cecbe2344700e1fa13ff66953d55.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mecke<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=6524e85551bc184a913f8d7bcb01fbee.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marquis<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=2559f0fc273a98bc63fa9c8b6391f103.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marquis#2<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=e8269db3068e0b7a9244d612c617c579.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mandelin<br /><br />This is my first time using these tests, I&#039;m personally not a pill person i just know people. Are these pills safe? Are they a good time? What should i sell them as? <br />Also to my perspective buyers unfortunately my prices are $30 a single $25 for more than 2, pre-commission prices aswell, so these are going to be slightly more expensive than that.

				At least I&#039;m getting some contacts. And they are dealing in massive quantities so i have to bulk buy, but of course all testing will be done before hand out in the view of the public, samples and reviews will be done first before i start selling any MDxx pressed pills. Pure simple easy lets just hope my guy actual has some good stuff.

				Yeah sorry bud....&nbsp; &nbsp;I was not directing that rant at you... <br />Good on you for doing the right thing and at least running some tests on them...<br />Ive have given up sourcing them locally now..<br />If all domestic buyers at minimum do these three little tests to confirm active contents before purchase we may be able to slow down the stream of shit flooding the market and maybe start to see something that resembles ecstasy make an appearance.<br />But if muggs here keep paying for shit on the blind then the suppliers will keep pushing it...<br /><br />Stop paying for shit.
