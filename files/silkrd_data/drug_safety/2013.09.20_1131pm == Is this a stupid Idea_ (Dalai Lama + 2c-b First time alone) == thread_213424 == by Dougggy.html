				I&#039;ve just made an order of some LSD and 2c-b for me and a few friends in two weeks. These were 20mg capsules and 210ug Dalai Lama blotters, could I test them before?<br />I would likely to be doing the whole tab and possibly the 2cb either during the trip or the following night. I have done 2cb once before, and quite enjoyed it, but I&#039;ve never done acid. (Although done DMT many times).<br />I am probably going to be forced to stay in my room for the trip for various reasons, but I am aiming for an extremely spiritual trip. I am going to be meditating, read some of the Kybalion and aim for an overall spiritual and enlightening trip. Would I likely be able to do this without tripping out and running into the street?&nbsp; ::)<br />I can&#039;t get anyone to trip sit me, or trip with me until I do it with my 3 friends that are coming down for the weekend. Should I take half the tab and see how it goes or will I be OK with a full tab? I&#039;m not sure 2cb mixed with LSD would be such a great Idea for my first time, but It&#039;s only 20mg so I suppose It could work.<br /><br />Tl;dr; 210ug too much for my first trip alone? With 2cb? <br />~D

				And just as a note; I am likely to go ahead with this either way, taking half of the LSD tab at the least.<br />So my question is not specifically if it is a stupid idea, but more so what the best way to go about this is.<br />~D

				If you have never done LSD before, I would say it is a bad idea. Besides, you don&#039;t want to build up a tolerance.

				take the tab, it will be awesome without need 2c-b.<br /><br />to me ~20 2c-b got annoying body load, and maybe can ruin a little bit the lsd trip.
