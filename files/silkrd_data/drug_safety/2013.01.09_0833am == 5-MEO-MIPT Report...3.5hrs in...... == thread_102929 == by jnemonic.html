				Before i say anything, massive thanks to Methaqualone. Your Moxy is simply amazing.<br /><br />OK....as the title says, its been 3.5hrs since i took around 15mg&#039;s of Methaqualone&#039;s moxy........fucking awesome shit M...<br />My first time taking this also.<br /><br />Fuck where to begin....well theres no way i could have started to write this any earlier, maybe i could have, but i have been out, and just got back home, so i thought i&#039;d write to you all about this...<br /><br />I had the Moxy at 14:00, its now 17:48 and i&#039;m still flying, i feel as though i could be anywhere right now. <br /><br />I seem to have this amazing visual clarity of my laptops keyboard, the keys are almost magnified in a way, making mistakes whilst typing seems impossible, which to me is just fantastic right now. Body load is still strong, but its nice, it feels good, theres an almost LSD type edge to what i&#039;m feeling in regards to the body load, but so much cleaner..<br /><br />I was driving earlier, not long after i had taken the Moxy, and it hit me hard enough to make me turn the car around and get my shit together. I parked in the side street to my house, got out and headed back home. I had just done a car swap so i could deliver some mag wheels from an ebay sale. So i had a borrowed car, and current mission is currently aborted due to me flying!<br /><br />As i was walking to my house i thought did i take too much..i know 7-9mg is the normal dose, so i thought yeah you did...but i&#039;m glad i did, for its given me a great understanding and insight into this, what i think would have to be my next favourite drug to MDMA and cocaine. This is a very sensory drug, in the right enviroment, and i mean in the RIGHT enviroment, it would be an amazing sensory overload. Its now 4 hrs in and i feel as though i could do anything, great energy levels, etc.<br /><br />So when i got back home i tried rolling a joint, thats when i noticed the visuals more, chopping the weed in the bowl....once that TASK was over i found i couldnt really be bothered smoking it, tried, took a few puffs, and then just let it sit, over it, no time for that...<br />Reality check-TAKE THE WHEELS! Realized i had been munging out for awhile, so grabbed the car keys and thought lets get this over with.<br />The place where i had to drop the wheels off to had no parking to unload, which i thought was just wrong, but didnt matter, parked opposite and lugged those big fuckers over the road 2 at a time. <br />Made sure i kept my sunglasses on through the whole process and found i could talk normal, i felt great. I looked at the lady serving me and wondered if i&#039;d fuck her or not, nope, not even a sympathy fuck..but that was a split second thought.<br />So happy all that was over, now to drop car off and get my car back home. Driving was fantastic, sitting at the intersections, cars looked as though they were breathing, and the road had more textures to it than i&#039;ve noticed before. Once back in my car, i found the sound of the engine and exhaust simply too good to ignore and turned my stereo off. Its a turbo charged V6 with only a single muffler and it sounds amazing, i was in 2 minds to hit the freeway and unleash hell or stay where i am and get home.....my instincts told me to get home and so i did. <br /><br />Jumped out of car feeling awesome, the breeze felt so good...i noticed my housemate wasnt home, so i thought awesome i can water my plants! <br />If house mate knew i was growing pot we would have a heart attack. <br /><br />I have this amazing part of the house where no one has ever gone...except me so its perfect. But low and behold of all the days, just as i&#039;m looking at how beautiful my plants have grown, and just about to water them with their first treat of bloom(bat shit), i hear the dreaded sound of my housemates car pull up. If i walk out from where i am, the location is gone, house mate has a massive heart attack and i&#039;m left with a dead body and dope plants whilst flying from this amazing moxy...so i did the only thing i could do, i leapt over the fence like i was Usain Bolt and sprinted down besides my new next door neighbours house, praying like fuck no one was home, of course theres a car in the driveway, so i just ran, i felt very speedy, vroom through their front lawn and out. Made a casual walk towards my house and all was good. My secret location will still be a secret...unless my new next door neighbour decides to have a look over the fence where i had suddenly appeared from? Best i dont think of that, he/they could have been anywhere...hopefully on the toilet lol.... :P<br /><br />Its now 18:30, and i feel as though i could possibly eat something, but i think i&#039;d prefer a joint right now. Just looked in the mirror, eyes are still dinner plates.<br /><br />So all in all what an amazing drug. I had nothing to do today and tomorrow so i thought i&#039;d give it a go. My friend had one before me a few days earlier and said nice but could be a bit stronger, thats why i had more, but i should have realized he had been rolling on molly earlier to that, so he would have had a higher tolerence to it at that time..<br /><br />This would be an amazing mix with MDMA and cocaine, coke would be just fantastic if you ask me, but only a little bit. Body load is enough with the Moxy thats for sure. I&#039;d only take a bump here and there, especially if your in THAT enviroment. ;)<br /><br />So bodyload is heavy, but remember i took more than i should have, but if you want a nice ride, then have 14-16mg&#039;s by all means. If you havent had hard rolls/trips, etc in the past, then i would suggest 7-8mg only first try.<br />Visuals are very light if hardly anything, just enhanced visual clarity if anything. Actually earlier when i was looking at the tv i think there was some visual dis-color or something, but i think because my eyes were seeing more than they usually do, perhaps i was just seeing the bad image quality of the actual tv itself? Even now...ah its just my eyes, your off your face wake up!! :P<br /><br />Had fun and enjoyed the day on Moxy. I&#039;ll only have this again when i&#039;m in the right enviroment, and then i&#039;m sure it will be extra special. ;)<br /><br />So its been exactly 5 hrs now since i started. This has taken a little while to write, but during this time i&#039;ve been out in the garage, gave it a clean, went through some shit, and started getting dinner ready. Still feeling very light footed, body feels fucking great. If i had my GF here, then this post would have been written tomorrow sometime... :P But shes another world away... :&#039;(<br /><br />Thanks to anyone who read this, if none of you have tried 5-MEO-MIPT- Moxy before i suggest you try it. Have it with your mdma or just by itself...or whatever! :D<br /><br /><br />Thank you Methaqualone, just found my new drug of choice. 8)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Great post!<br /><br />In my experience Moxy works very well downers/relaxants. GHB, 2C-C, even a little alcohol (but just a little). <br /><br />Seems to really balance and harmonize Moxy&#039;s own stimulating properties...<br /><br />BG

				+1, good read. I&#039;d recommend a lower starting dose to beginners though. Something like 4-6mg depending on your body weight.

Even 3mg is quite pleasant and usable while allowing normal functioning and social interaction. Low doses I find are actually preferable in the bedroom as less &quot;trip&quot; to contend with - but still good heart and body expansion...
