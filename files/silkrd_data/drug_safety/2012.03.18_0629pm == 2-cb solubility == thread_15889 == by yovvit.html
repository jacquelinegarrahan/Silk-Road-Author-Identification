			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m getting 125mg of 2-cb next weekend and sharing it with 4 others (it&#039;s tan coloured so I assume it&#039;s the HBr variant rather than HCl, can anyone confirm this?), and since none of us want to snort it we&#039;re gonna dissolve it and drink it. <br />Would 125mg dissolve fine in 100ml of water? and then we could just each drink 20ml for a 25mg dose right? Would it be better to use 100ml vodka? <br />Any advice is both helpful and greatly appreciated.<br />Thanks it advance,<br />yovvit.

				@Guybrush do you think it would dissolve better in alcohol?<br /><br />@poolsclosed I&#039;m reluctant to as I don&#039;t want to eyeball it and I don&#039;t have a scale, liquid would be more accurate

				2c-b is certainly soluble in distilled water, but it seems to be one of the least willing of the 2c-x&#039;s.&nbsp; The HBr is easy enough, but the HCl is soluble as well.&nbsp; If it is indeed the HBr, you could achieve a pretty high ratio, possibly one of 8 mg:1 mL (though that&#039;s getting into awkward dosing territory).&nbsp; The following quotes taken from this thread (clearnet): bluelight.ru/vb/threads/399330-2C-B-Subthread-2C-B-Storage-and-Solubility<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve found 2C-B (HCl I think) to be less readily soluble in water than the other 2Cs, but still quite soluble. It takes a minute of stirring to get it all dissolved, and not quite as much can fit in to a mL. But nevertheless, for all practical purposes, it&#039;s plenty soluble.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I tried to put 2c-b into solution this evening 15mg/5ml, i had to heat the solution quite a bit to get it all to dissolve though.

After 5 minutes of shaking, I still saw flecks of 2C-B floating around and I just ended up swallowing it.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>2c-b is alcohol soluble.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />And this bit, which is quoted in the above thread, but is originally from erowid:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: erowid.org</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For this example, lets say that we have a material for which +/- 1mg is no big deal (something like 2CB), so perhaps our target accuracy is 2mg. We Rule of 10 Thumbs this to get 10 drops per 2mg, or 5drops per milligram. That would allow me to put ~68 mg of material in the 20ml bottle ( ( 17 drops per ml / 5 drops per milligram ) * 20ml in bottle ). I think I&#039;d rather reduce the accuracy a little and get more in the bottle, so I decide to go with 2 drops per milligram which will reduce my target accuracy quite a bit, but its still fine. If I slip and accidentally get an extra couple milligrams of 2CB, I&#039;ll survive. At 2 drops per milligram, that means 7-8 milligrams per milliliter (15-18 drops per milliliter for the example dropper). That means that about 150 milligrams in my 20ml dropper bottle. Thats a good amount and 2CB is nice and stable in distilled water.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				@foxymeow do you reckon it would be alright dissolving 125mg in 100mL water if i used the microwave?<br /><br />@Appa thanks for finding these links, they&#039;re useful :) but would the ratio I stated here ^ (1.25mg:1mL) work ok? I think it&#039;s easier to measure an amount such as 20mL for each of us as opposed to 3mL for each of us in a 8mg:1mL ratio. Also do you think it would be better to dissolve in the same amount of vodka rather than water?<br /><br />thanks for everyone&#039;s help.

				thanks very much Appa, you&#039;ve answered all my questions excellently :) I&#039;ll probably use water (distilled if I can get hold of any) to avoid adverse alcoholic affects. Do you think drinking after I come down from the 2-cb is a bad idea?<br />thanks again,<br />yovvit

				@Ianfleming<br />I knew because my dealer said which it was.<br />I&#039;m not sure if you can tell without the proper equipment. I have an idea yet I&#039;m not sure if this would work:<br />-First, test if your 2c-b dissolves, if so, add NaCl , keep adding it, if it was 2c-b·HCl the 2c-b would precipitate - i&#039;m kinda sure there was something like this back when I did chemistry<br /><br />Also, just for the record, when I tried to dissolve the 2c-b, I did use tap water, distilled water must work better.

				I tend to stick to my moonshine (100 proof clear corn whiskey) solution. I find that 5mg-1ml/cc works quite nice, that gives me 1 dose per dram, and I can take 1 or 2 drams at a time (for a light or heavy dose). (keep in mind, I&#039;m using 2c-i, not 2c-b)

				Don&#039;t use grain alchohol as it will evaporate too fast. I usually use vodka. <br /><br />33 drops in a standard medicine dropper = 1ml <br /><br />I do 12mg per drop. So I do 420mg per ml (round it up a bit just to be safe).
