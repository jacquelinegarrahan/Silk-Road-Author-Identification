				In my experience with acid, most blotters tend to be around 100ug (though many claiming as such are often less). Since there is no easy way to find out how much acid is in a blotter, my understanding of this trend is to make it easier to estimate doses with unknown tabs. With some chemists laying their blotters at 300ug+, unsuspecting consumers of 2 or more tabs could very well end up with a 24hr bad trip. I know that for myself, the ~300ug Dalai Lama tabs going around kick my ass with just one, so much so that I would prefer if they were a little less potent. Since 100ug is still a pretty decent trip for most people, it makes more sense to dose blotters at that level. This way, finer control of dosages is allowed, as cutting a blotter in more than 2 even pieces is pretty tough. <br /><br />So essentially, it comes down to these points in favor of standard 100ug blotters:<br />(i) Easier to estimate dosage for consumers, since not everyone buys directly from people who know the true dosage<br />(ii) Less likely for people to unknowingly take massive dosages<br />(iii) Finer control over dosage<br />(iv) one tab is a good amount for first timers (as opposed to 300+ ug)<br /><br />Obviously, it is a free and unregulated market, so no one can force anyone to modify their product. But I post this in hopes of appealing to the blotter layers out there to promote a safer acid market. What does the SR community think of my rationale?

				I kinda think that the people laying the really high-dosage blotter are the people who were around when acid originally came out, because that&#039;s what a typical dosage was for a really high and introspective trip. I think the difference now is that people aren&#039;t looking for the same effects. I would have to agree that it&#039;s better when some fraction of a full dose is the unit, because that way you can customize your trip. In this case, I think 100ug would be an appropriate dosage, as you posited.

				I agree with this &quot;standard&quot; for sure. Although I don&#039;t think there is anything wrong with vendors selling higher doses as long as they advertise the dose. Of course this can still eventually be consumed by someone who wants less, but it is the responsibility of sellers (even if that seller is just a friend that&#039;s transferring the tabs) to inform the buyer of the dose. If the buyer doesn&#039;t listen, then it&#039;s their fault.

				I just assume whatever I buy is 100 because they&#039;re all pretty much the same any anyone claiming more usually lies. <br /><br />I heard somewhere that paper can&#039;t hold more than 180 per tab, I guess that&#039;s not true though.

				The Dalai Lamas are more in the 200-220ug range. I don&#039;t often dose under 400-500ug myself.

				Obviously tolerance will vary from person to person, but really I think 100ug is pretty low... For all the hype and stereotype of lsd, its actually a very gentle and mild drug until you get into the higher end of doses. For most people, I&#039;d say go ~150ug which means cutting a 300ug trip in half is perfect.<br /><br />300+ is a pretty intense experience and yes definitely not for everyone, but I like the option of being able to buy them if I want.<br /><br />qrbr6, yeah thats wrong. It depends on the concentration of lsd though. It is crystals, then dissolved in liquid to be applied to sheets. I&#039;ve seen it done in low concentrations, so you pretty much soak a sheet then bring it out to dry. That would be limited I guess, and would be quite low concentration. More common is to use a dropper bottle and place a drop on each tab. That drop will contain usually 100ug, sometimes 150. Easy enough to put 2 drops on if needed.

I know so many people who are wary of taking higher doses of LSD, when really i think its not as intense as some people make it seem ( by all means iv had intense acid trips, never nething i couldnt handle)<br /><br />I would love to see some 300ug tabs, eating one, one an a half would be my sweet spot. <br />Every now n then im sure i would eat 2 tabs and go with it. <br /><br />Shit if i ever see 300ug tabs, i want a fucking sheeeeeeett

				No matter what I get, I almost always do a test run of 1 hit to determine general strength.<br />I don&#039;t think vendors should stop selling powerful hits, and there are few who ever do.<br />This should read: Buyers who THINK they can handle 300+ug beware.&nbsp; Anyone with any experience would not be too fazed by such a tab, nor would they just pop four of em, thinking they were lowly 80ug tabs.<br />Vendors need to be more honest about the amounts, because there are few that actually have 100ug or more.&nbsp; Tony76 doesn&#039;t know how highly dosed his tabs are, and I&#039;d say they&#039;re one of the most powerful ones available.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any of the 300+ tabs from Juergen or NeuroticNarcotic yet, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re bad for the acid market in the least.&nbsp; We are all responsible for determining what we can handle in this illegal market.
