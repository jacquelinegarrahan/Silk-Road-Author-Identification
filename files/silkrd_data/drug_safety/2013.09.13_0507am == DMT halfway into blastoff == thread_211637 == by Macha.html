				Hi guys, I just tried some DMT and I didn&#039;t go to hyperspace. I used a 2 liter bottle with the bottom cut off and put foil on and melted the dmt until the bottle was full of smoke. I exhaled it all and while holding it in, my vision became extremely intense, things started to move in unison as if it was moving with a beat. I did hear extremely noisy ringing holding the dmt in and felt like everything was vibrating after I exhaled. I felt like I was actually being blasted off and that my bed was a hospital bed in some sort of foreign place. I saw my painting turn into abstract shapes and I was holding onto my bed but then I returned back to normal kind of quickly(had visions like I was on LSD for good 5 minutes though). Not gonna lie, it was kind of scary because it happened so fast and it was my first time! Would this indicate that I need more DMT or that I need to hold it longer or my smoking technique wasn&#039;t the right way? Any insight to help me blast off would be great to hear!

				Ok let me break it all down for you<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DMT IS NOT A RECREATIONAL DRUG, it is literally the spirit molecule. Before you do DMT you should have some prior psychedelic experience (you don&#039;t go on the fastest roller coaster your first time at the local carnival now do you?). When you break through you will be in a world of paradise.<br /><br /><br />Here is how to smoke it<br /><br />I use the Terence Mckenna method of three tokes<br /><br />Follow these steps<br />1. Sandwich the DMT (50mg) between some Cannabis in a bong or a pipe<br />2. GENTLY set the flame on top of the bud until you get a cherry (should be VERY quick)<br />3. Take a MASSIVE rip it will taste like shit<br />4. Hold it in as long as you can<br />5. Repeat twice for a total of three times<br /><br />you should be in hyperspace, now note this is how I do it and everyone I have done business with have broken through. Although there are other methods

				Hello Macha, welcome to the DMT world.<br /><br />Just to start with, grab your 2 liter bottle with the foil, go outside and throw it in the rubbish bin&nbsp; :D<br />This is not a good and successful method to smoke your dmt.<br /><br />The sandwich method that LordBiron suggest is an easy way as well although I haven&#039;t used it since I don&#039;t want to mix my DMT with cannabis. It works but some say it can make your trip a bit blur. I like to smoke it neat without any other substances involved. (Maybe only LSD)<br /><br />I would recommend buying the Glass Vapor Genie pipe or build &quot;The Machine&quot; <br />But the decision is yours again how to do it. But before trying again, I would strongly suggest you spend some time researching on how to do it correctly (because as you noticed it is not easy).<br /><br />You can check out this thread I made when I began to ask how to do it, which contains many useful detail on the procedure and I believe it will answer many of your questions. Check it out<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.0<br /><br />Another thread your can check is <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0 <br />The first message have some variety on the way how to use it.<br /><br />Hope this message will help you. <br />And remember that DMT has a learning curve on the way how to use it. After few times you will eventually learn how to do it correct. It just needs some practice.<br /><br />Take care,<br /><br />Adamiz<br />&nbsp;
