				So I had a solution of 250 mg of pure alprazolam powder and I dissolved it in 200 ml of 190 proof everclear. I was kind of disappointed with the results, as there was way too much alcohol. So my question is: since ethanol has a boiling point of 78.37Â°C and alprazolam has a boiling point that is much higher (i don&#039;t know the exact temperature), but if I boil off some ethanol would it ruin the solution? Right now I have about 170 ml left of the solution, so i&#039;m guessing there is roughly 220mg of alprazolam left. I want it to be like 2mg per .25 ml, how should I go about this?<br /><br />I&#039;m not expert chemist so <br />Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!

				You are in luck. Alprazolam is a rather stable substance, and you can just boil off the excess solvent by heating the solution. <br /><br />Since you used 95% alcohol to dissolve it, there would be no problem evaporating 80-90% or so of the volume away, the concentration will simply rise fivefold if you do. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t boil it dry though - if the temperature shoots up over 200 degrees C you may get decomposition and ruin the alprazolam. <br /><br />Also, don&#039;t over-concentrate it: alprazolam is not soluble in alcohol to enormous amounts. If you get to the point of 1 mg/ml, that should be very practical to handle, and i would not risk concentrating it any further by boiling solvent off using heat. You could use vacuum evaporation in a rotovap to get rid of the solvent completely, but i suppose you do not have a rotovap if you are asking.

				Sorry to bring up an old thread but what do you think the maxiumum solubility would be in 80 proof alcohol?

				1. look up the solubility for alprazolam in ethanol<br />2. multiply by 0.4 (80 proof)<br />3. ? ? ?<br />4. profit

				It&#039;s actually not that simple - 80 proof liquor has more water in it that it has alcohol, and you will run into problems with solubility. It also greatly depends on temperature, you can dissolve a lot more in warm 40% alcohol than you can in room temperature or cold alcohol. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t calculated it though, but i think something like 80 proof&nbsp; / 40% alcohol would hold 1 mg/ml at room temperature quite easily. If you&nbsp; can, use something with a higher alcohol level though, it&#039;s much easier to evaporate alcohol off if you ever want to concentrate your solution or get a solid powder back.

				It depends on temperature but solubility values are always for a given temperature, obviously. Even a tiny bit of another solvent can help something become soluble though, injectable diazepam is mostly water for example.<br />I agree that using something like everclear is a better option, but if only 80 proof alcohol is available it should work fine.
