				Hello SR,<br />A couple months ago, I bought some Molly from a trusted local friend. It was absolutely fantastic and I really want to know exactly what was in it as it was sort of different than any I&#039;ve had before. I believe it was cut with something and I&#039;m hoping someone here can help me identify it. Unfortunately that friend has since moved and I haven&#039;t been able to reach him. (one of the reasons i&#039;ve been trying SR lately)<br /><br />First off, I have done e dozens of times taking all percations such as proper vitamins, 5htp, hydration, leaving plenty of time for tolerance, etc. I&#039;ve had good molly before this and after this batch and I know it&#039;s not just trying to chase the original magic. I try to be healty and smart about this stuff...<br /><br />It was moderately and consistently powdery (pretty fine) and had a yellowish tint.<br />It was not that speedy and seemed to make me think clearer and didn&#039;t mess with my memory as much as others. I could remember details about the roll pretty clearly afterward. Depression afterward was there but not too bad because the trip felt more meaningful.<br />There was one time that I went to a small party a day or two after a roll and decided to try a bit again, not expecting much, but it still worked very well.<br />The best part of it was its visuals. It had amazing visuals and hallucinations. They were different than say, lsd and other molly i&#039;ve tried in that I could sort of control what I saw and manipulate the hallucinations. More &#039;something from nothing&#039; than just manipulating what was there.<br /><br />I wish I saved some so I could have done a proper test on it...<br /><br />I haven&#039;t really done much more than mdma, bk-mdma and lsd so any help would be greatly appreciated. I know molly comes in many different forms and colors because of prep methods, impurities, etc, but any information about this would be greatly appreciated. Is it something I could find or do easily, or was something more dangerous added?

				Read the trip reports in a MDA vendor review thread.&nbsp; Sounds like you had that.&nbsp; <br /><br />MDA = MDMA with a minor psycedelic twist.&nbsp; Montell Williams has some bomb mda.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27086.0

				Thanks for the replies. Too many derivatives to keep track of... Guess it makes sense now reading some of those reports and my description.<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably try some of the Montell Williams (lol) soon.

				I appreciate everybody&#039;s input on this and I&#039;ll probably use your advice in future purchases.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve been reading lately, MDA seems most likely to be it and I&#039;ve just ordered a bit to test.<br />Ketamine is also plausible. It has been available locally before so who knows. I&#039;ll probably try it if MDA doesn&#039;t cut it (and when money happens).<br />Never really looked into 2cb but I&#039;ll keep it in mind. I&#039;ve done some candyflipping before and it was awesome, but not quite the same. Is this stuff similar?<br />I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s not meth... I&#039;ve never purposely tried meth (but I know its used to cut often), and it&#039;s always kind of scared me. This stuff wasn&#039;t as speedy as other molly or what I think meth would be. It&#039;s pretty low on my list of things to try if at all.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update if I eventually find it, but everybody has their own ideal trip and probably won&#039;t care&nbsp; :P<br />Thanks again!
