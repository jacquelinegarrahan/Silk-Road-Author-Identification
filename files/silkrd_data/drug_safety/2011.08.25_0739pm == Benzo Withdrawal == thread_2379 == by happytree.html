				So, since there was an Opiate withdrawal topic, I thought I&#039;d start this one. A friend on mine on here and I exchanged some info on my much needed anxiety medication. Roughly four-six weeks ago, I started taking Xanax daily. At first, about 1-2mg then most recently at about 2-4mg a day. <br /><br />Despite the advise given, I didn&#039;t have any put aside, and ran out yesterday. Last night, 0 hours, maybe 5 minutes of sleep. That might be an over estimate. I&#039;ve been through opiate withdrawals (including 100mcg Fentynal a day) many times. And I would compare this shitty-ass physical condition I&#039;m in, since the start of my &quot;xanax withdrawal&quot;, comparable. I always forget the slave I become&nbsp; (especially prescription) these drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-[

				Benzos are the worst.<br />I always when I get my script I take a weeks worth of benzos out and put them to the side.<br />try to taper down to 2.5-3mg a day and ask your doctor about a dosage increase.<br />like 1mg 3 times a day and try not to overly abuse them.<br />Don&#039;t take them unless you absouletly need to.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Yeah, I was auto-taking them (per doc advice) one in am, then one at night. Then I up&#039;d it to two in a.m and two at night. Two short of time period that I increased dosage. <br /><br />When I get (if I think it&#039;s even WORTH it) refilled, I&#039;m going to only take to come off the cola. This shit is NOT worth my lack of discipline!

				If you have an addictive personality it&#039;s not good, but i went thru and addictive phase switched to ativan which was not very abusable to me and then a year later switched back to xanax and I haven&#039;t had any issues any more.<br />Self control and desire are hard to control at times. <br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Im with Nomad on this 1000 percent. Benzo W/D are so much worse than opiates. Benzo Wd can actually kill you. While with opiate W/D its intense but it does start to diminish after a few days. With Benzo WD its just starting to ramp up after a few days.. It takes a long time to do a proper taper of benzos. I recommend that you never become dependent on them at all.<br /><br />15 years ago or so, I was scripted 7 2mg xanax bars a day. (could have been 6, all i know it was the most a doctor can legally prescribe to a patient at that time) I did a slow taper (like a month or so) It wasn&#039;t slow enough, so, I stretched it out over 4&nbsp; months. even when I got down to 2mg a day, I felt like literal shit.. <br /><br />It took&nbsp; me a full year to start to feel normal again.. I wouldn&#039;t wish benzo wd upon my worst enemy. Well, ok, maybe my worst enemy, but you get the idea...No words can describe the feeling all you can do is experience it and you for sure don&#039;t want to do that....trust me...

				Wow, yeah that&#039;s crazy. As I mentioned, having gone through what I considered the &quot;worst&quot; of opiate withdrawals, I guess I considered myself immune to anything worse. It&#039;s day 2, and it&#039;s getting worse. Thank heaven I have a few vic&#039;s left. Earlier today when I hadn&#039;t taken one, I was shaking, vision was all crazy. <br /><br />I may just tell my doc that I want to switch to something else. No more benzo dependency (that fast) for me please!<br />

				wow this makes my benzo habit seem like cake.<br /><br />For awhile I got too many 2mg xanax, did 2mg a day for like 30-45 days, then had to taper for a month and a half (1 1/2 for a week, 1 for a week, 1/2 for a week, 1/4 for a week, then 1/4 every other day). After I was done tapering, damn near got a panic attack a few days later. Luckily, that was the peak of my withdrawal.<br /><br />I had another friend who did a little more, for a little longer, and stopped cold turkey. He got bakeracted for going literally insane for a few days (he constantly thought he was at work, even though he was at home, or the park, or wherever).<br /><br />He&#039;s pretty much back to normal though.<br /><br />Best advice, try not to make your benzo habit too regular. It fucking sucks coming off.

				I&#039;ve been on 2 mg a day for about 5 years now. If I miss a dose, I&#039;m feeling shitty in a few hours. They don&#039;t do much for me anymore. I just take them so I don&#039;t have to go through withdrawl.

				You should switch to a long lasting benzo with active metabolites. diazepam being the drug of choice. You can get it as solution and reduce dose in 0.5mg steps.

				Use melatonine for the sleep issues.&nbsp; If u are in the states, go to a wallgreens and u can pick up 5mg pills that will definitely help u sleep and since it&#039;s a natural substance your body already creates u wont get hooked on it. <br /><br />U need to sleep...and sleep well while passed out.&nbsp; This will help your body get over the &quot;need&quot; for benzos.

				Hello, <br /><br />I&#039;ve been using benzo for 4 years straight (it was a &quot;rivotril&quot; medicine based on Clonazepam, i used to take 15 drips every days under medical supervision).<br /><br />Yes,&nbsp; it&#039;s pretty weird to stop (insomnia, sweating, minor mood modification) but I cant compare to opiate or others since I&#039;ve only been using weed.<br />What I hated the most was my feet shivering &quot;automatically&quot; before sleeping, it kind of woke me up in the middle of my sleep.<br />It was also the aftereffect that lasted the most (approx 2 month very disturbing then 2/3 months milder) <br /><br />My advise : do NOT take any other drug, drink verbena infusion right after dinner then calm down (do not party) and take another sleeping-friendly infusion if required.&nbsp; my doctor always told NEVER take even wine during the craving as my brain would be lured and interpret it as a benzo effect hence bolstering withdrawing symptoms.<br /><br />Whats more, I &#039;ve been stopping progressively reduce 50% the first week then 5% every following week<br />I should note that I hated the effect of benzo when I took them, so i was very happy to stop it but that was creepy it was as if my body needed it.<br /><br />I can understand in case you liked it very much, it must be all the more difficult. <br /><br />3 months after the beginning of the craving, i took small amount of pot (1 pure small j/day), it helped me with easing the shivering.<br />(WARNING, a big dose of cannabis will have the very opposite effect , I have experienced that !!)<br />Now, I only take cannabis and am very happy with that !<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english, <br />Keep us informed, good luck<br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve read a lot about benzo withdrawal and the symptoms don&#039;t look that great. I had a friend who was going through opiate withdrawal and said the only thing that helped with the pain was benzos - in this case is was generic xanax. Long story short, I&#039;ve been taking generic xanax (alprozolam) for many many months and often on a regular basis go way about the recommended dosage, but then I went cold turkey for a couple of months and I have never experienced benzo withdrawal. From the sounds of it, I&#039;m very glad it hasn&#039;t happened to me. Also I don&#039;t have an addictive personality. Not at all actually. I would put my personality at bland, but not addictive in the slightest.&nbsp; &nbsp;
