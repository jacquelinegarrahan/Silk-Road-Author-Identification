				So I&#039;ve been on Prozac for about two months now. It&#039;s not an MAOI inhibitor thankfully, but are there certain substances I can take that would cause a bad interaction with the medication or make the substances not as effective?<br /><br />I&#039;m mainly wondering about shrooms, mdma, and LSD. Any input would be welcome.

				Pretty much most of the serotonin receptor agonists are going to be either moot or so weak that you will notice almost nil effect. The reason being is that SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin-and, unfortunately, chemicals with similar structures. So shrooms, lsd, mescaline and anthying that you research that works on 5HT receptors are probably not going to work.<br /><br />&nbsp;MDMA; I am unsure of this one. I heard it works more dopaminergically; however, it does have some mechanistic 5HT action, which I have found so profound that it similarly kills the MDMA.<br /><br />MAOIs such as syrian rue that are often used in conjunction with serotonergic drugs, such as DMT, may be fatal in conjunction with SSRIs. The reason is that these keep monoamines from breaking down; since the SSRI blocks reuptake, you can wind up with serotonin syndrome and die due to surplus serotonin.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Dunno about you but Id avoid antidepressants... eat raw, healthy food, lay off junk shit food and sugar and animal fat. <br /><br />All the mass shootings in US, all those involved are usually on or coming off antidepressants.<br /><br />Pharma drugs kill. <br /><br />Find some mescaline and magic mush... let them heal you.

I was put on the antidepressants due to PTSD and they have actually helped immensely. I&#039;m not sure how commonly known this is about PTSD, but there is a physical and mental side to it. The physical side is actually neuron cell death do to an overload of neurotransmitters during the traumatic events. The antidepressant they have me on causes new neuron growth. I can&#039;t take myself off of it yet because the benefits are outweighing the downside in my situation and my sense of well being has increased a lot. I used to be a daily pot smoker and it helped in the same way, but circumstances dictated I stopped smoking for a while for employment reasons as well as tolerance. I&#039;m hoping to replace the neuron regeneration effect of the Prozac with Lions Mane mushrooms, but it takes a few months for their effect to kick in for my purposes. Shrooms helped a lot with the depression in the past but the effects from a balls out trip would only last a week or two at the most before the depression was back in full force.<br /><br />On another note, that sucks about the MDMA. I was considering candyflipping at an upcoming festival but I suppose that&#039;s a no go if half the cocktail won&#039;t work due to the meds.<br /><br />Would something like mescaline still work or would that also be hindered? <br /><br />I always liked the refreshed feeling halucinogens provided after a hardcore trip. They always worked like an astringent for the soul, leaving me renewed.<br /><br />
