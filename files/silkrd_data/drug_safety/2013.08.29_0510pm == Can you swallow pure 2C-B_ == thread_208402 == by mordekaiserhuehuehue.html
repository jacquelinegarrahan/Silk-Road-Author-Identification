				Mix it with a big glass of juice. Just stir it well and make sure there is no residue at the bottom. (Add more juice and mix up the residue.

				your best bet would be to do a parachute. Get a piece of tp and break it down to 1 ply. pick up from the corners and bring together then spin trapping the powder in the bottom.<br /><br />When taking parachutes most people put it pretty much down their throat (back of tongue D: ) so incase it opens it doesnt cover your whole mouth

				Along with what others have said. Having taken 2C-x before, it is one of the more unpleasant tastes one can have in their mouth. I have swallowed it straight and immediately ate something and drank water to get the taste out of my mouth, with shoddy success.<br /><br />Trip was good though. ;)

				i did 50 mg, and it was quite fun. One thing i must add, was that i had black lights and i couldnt handle having them on. I had to have them off or normal lights. something about the light made me feel like i was gonna have a seizure.

Nothing illegal about empty capsules.<br />I would do it just for the fun and order vitamin c, 5-HTP and magnesium with it just to see if there is a reaction. I would try to speak to the head pharmacist as I did in the past. If he can&#039;t do 1+1 than the other people working there will not I&#039;m sure. The 5-HTP will raise high attention I&#039;m SURE because it&#039;s super uncommon here. All the bees will fly around searching the storage boxes for it. And no one will see the MDMA connection. :-)<br /><br />It&#039;s just fantasy, maybe I&#039;ll do it. But I guess it would be boring since even if he made the connection he would not say anything. Manners are always highly important in Germany, which I find awesome, because people are always very friendly when you are. :-)<br /><br />lol

				I also got gel caps at pharmacies. Both times I got them for free, which makes me think it is not very common that people ask for them.<br /><br />First time the head pharmacist had to be asked for permission, she wanted to know why I needed them. I said &quot;Herbal medicine&quot;, to which see replied &quot;YOU????&quot;. I have no idea what to make of that, apparently I don&#039;t look like a herbal medicine kind of guy. At all. :-)<br /><br />The second time, at another pharmacy, the only question asked was: &quot;what size?&quot;. I had no idea, so I said &quot;oh, just the normal ones&quot; (He gave me size 0, which turn out to be quite big for 25 mg of 2cb: <br />(*clearnet*) http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/gelcap.sizechart.pdf )<br /><br />

The safest way is to just by some capsules that are filled. If you are really concerned about this. You can also buy them of off amazon for like 10$/1000 caps or so.

That stuff is said to be softer to the nose. The HCl versions of 2Cs are very painful, which thankfully is not much of an issue with the potent ones like 2C-P because you need so little of the substance, especially with this ROA.

				It should have been HCl, as the vendor lists it as HCl. For sure it was 2C-B (and great quality) because it had&nbsp; exactly the described effects for the dosage range I was in.<br />The MDMA was HCl too, but that was like &quot;fire in the hole&quot; ;D were 2C-B was almost unnoticeable even though the volume of both were about the same sometimes. The 2C-B seems more like super fine flour, while the MDMA is more like crushed ocean salt, I guess that makes the difference and it makes the MDMA more aggressive inside the nose.

				2C anything burns more than MDMA.&nbsp; MDMA does burn though.&nbsp; I only snort 2C chemicals! :D
