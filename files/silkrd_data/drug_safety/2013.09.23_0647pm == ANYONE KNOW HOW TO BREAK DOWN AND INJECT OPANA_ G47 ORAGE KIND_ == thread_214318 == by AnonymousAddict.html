				If it&#039;s crushable, then you do the exact same shit you would with any other crushable tablet.<br />There&#039;s plenty of FAQs all over the place on how to crush and shoot pills.<br />However, I think shooting pills of any kind is a terrible idea, and know nothing about which methods actually work well due to lack of experience with said ROA.<br />If you&#039;ve never IV&#039;d a pill before, don&#039;t start now.<br />That&#039;s the start of a long and dangerous road.

				The Iso alcohol way is the only way i&#039;ve heard of and you pretty much end up with pure oxymorphone i think.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done it myself but there are guides all over the clearnet on how to do it.&nbsp;
