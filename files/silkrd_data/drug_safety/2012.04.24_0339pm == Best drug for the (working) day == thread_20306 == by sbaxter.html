				Hi,<br /><br />I have recently had to (totally) stop drinking alcohol, which I was rather heavily (ab)using, due to the state of my liver.<br /><br />Now I am trying some drugs to help with my latent anxiety and general symptoms of depression.<br />Something that doesn&#039;t numb me down like benzos or makes me unable to work, like psychedelics.<br />Is there any such drug that both takes away anxiety and increases motivation, energy, general &quot;wakefulness&quot;?<br />How about weed? Everything I have smoked so far (probably mostly indica) is fine for the evening for me, but would make me too<br />tired/lazy to work. Sativa should have the effect I want, any recommendations for a specific strain and/or vendor?<br /><br />Of course I realize that having experience with alcohol for more than 20 years cannot be instantly re-learned for<br />another drug, and I am also trying other, non-drug, alternatives to better cope with life.But maybe someone<br />can come up with some advice or at least some ways NOT to go (I won&#039;t do any IV, and of course I should avoid<br />anything that is toxic to the liver). Vendors recommending their own products welcome :)<br /><br /><br />Thx for reading!<br /><br />SB

				I don&#039;t know if it would decrease anxiety but adderall definitely increases motivation, at least for me. I usually don&#039;t take it at work, but the one time I did it was very pleasant. I love adderall, however some people say it makes them feel too speedy. If you haven&#039;t tried it before, maybe try a small dose (10mg&#039;s) one day when you are not at work and see how you like it. The only side effect i&#039;ve noticed is loss of appetite. Also I am usually very active when on it, so after the comedown I am usually pretty tired and don&#039;t feel like doing a whole lot. And if you are going to try it during work I would recommend the XR.

				If you do amphetamin every day it will most likely increase anxiety IMHO<br /><br />Maybe look into Nootropic!<br /><br />I really enjoy Aniracetam and Oxiracetam. They give you a small mood boost, are anti anxiety for me and you will be more focused.<br /><br />Also they are neuroprotective and not neurotoxic as amphetamines are and legal to obtain mostly.<br /><br />you can also google noopept!<br /><br />good luck with your liver<br /><br />

				From my personal experience, I think your the exact type of person that would benefit from going on Wellbutrin extended release, it isn&#039;t an SSRI, it isn&#039;t a Benzo, it&#039;s a class all on it&#039;s own. It&#039;ll do wonders for your anxiety and you will be more peppy and energetic, especially at higher doses. Now everyone reacts differently so you may not get these benefits, but you also have to give it 3-4 weeks, taking it daily in the morning as soon as you wake up.

				I would say speed, but if you have already had a substance problem. I doubt using an addicting substance is going to benefit the situation. Exercise, diet, and try to get hobbies that would feel up the time you normally spent drinking. But, 4FA does help me get through my day sometimes. (I know there is a chance it is highly neruotoxic. I guess it&#039;s a chance i take on some days.)

				Modafinil.<br />200mg on those days you can hardly find the will to get up with a red bull or a few espresso shots.<br />Caffeine puts Modafinil into overdrive, lots of focused energy and a general sense of wellbeing. Might make it a little jittery, or your jaw feel a little odd, but definitely worth it.

				Amphetamine (speed / adderall) is perfect to keep you going at work. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, though... replacing one addiction with another never seems a smart move. Unless the latter addiction is a healthy one (sports or something).

				If you have a damaged liver taking things like amphetamines, or anything that is even remotely narcotic will make it worse. Most drugs are excreted through your piss and sweat so you need to leave that shit alone for a while. Also if you are just flipping alcohol for something else you could just flip one problem for another. At the most you could take modafenil but other than that I recommend you leave everything alone for a while. <br /><br />

				Again, thx for your answers!<br /><br />Got the results of a recent blood test yesterday, everything quite fine :)<br />Tox screen showed THC and benzo traces of course.<br /><br />So I am only smoking joints and taking a little Ketamine now and then.<br />THC is no problem for the liver, rather maybe for the heart according to my doctor.<br />He doesn&#039;t like the K at all, so I will cut down on that, but currently the K<br />does wonders for me, even in very small dosages.

				Adderall (in moderation) if I want to get shit done at work. Bowl of weed if I don&#039;t want to do shit and just want the day to end.<br /><br />A few bowls of weed if I want to space out and raid the vending machines like a bank heist. I took had some edible lollipops and cookies I brought to work before, I greatly underestimated how high they would make me. I went all over the building to several vending machines so that no one would see the amount of munchie supplies I was hoarding. I went out to my car for a break, ended up falling asleep with my car on and woke up 3 hours later, walked back into work with like 30 minutes til I had to leave, no one even noticed I was gone....I felt very under appreciated, so ate another lollipop.

				I think it&#039;s a good call with the weed. I&#039;m not sure about the K though. I haven&#039;t tried it myself but I hear it can get out of control quickly. So be careful. But in the end, you shouldn&#039;t have to rely on much to get through the day. To have fun is another story. Just keep your brain and body active.

				Certain hashes are good for the working routine be it working on a building site or in an office.<br /><br />Bud - or decent bud just makes you want to watch funny things on YouTube.<br /><br />Speed is ok for emergency shifts. Say you had a 48 hr shift with a few of the lads or girls. Some work calls for that and you can make good money so its worth taking the speed hangover. Thing is try to actually buy some good speed here!<br /><br />So far I had 1.5 grams of a speed that got me snoring by 1.00am after starting the &#039;binge&#039; at 7.00pm or so.<br /><br />Adderal would be best. costly but maybe good.<br /><br />I have modofinil and not tried<br /><br />10mg of Ritalin done nothing really.

				I like a low to moderate dose of THC via edible means before the workday. I&#039;m not sure what strain the edibles were made from but I would say Sativa if I had to guess. They don&#039;t make me sleepy at all and the edible high seems to last for the entire 8 - 9 hours as opposed to smoking which only gives me 4 - 5 hours.

				Honestly, as much as I enjoy amphetamine, I don&#039;t think speed/adderall is very helpful for long term productivity unless you are pro at handling the comedowns that follow the highs. I might get tons of stuff done when I&#039;m &#039;high&#039;, but afterwards my motivation sinks below what it was in the first place which kind of defeats the point in my opinion. After burning out for awhile and waiting for the moment you can finally fall asleep - you&#039;ve wasted more time than you would have sober. Not to mention amphetamine won&#039;t do shit for your anxiety. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in trying modafinil though.. :)

				I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be some flaming after this, but I have gone through 18hour long days at work (non physical work, all mental and lots of talking to other people, not sales but) after eating 10mg of pure meth. Mood was a noticeably up, energy was great, appetite was definitely there and in fact I tended to eat more fatty food together with healthy food and heaps of extra vitamins/anti-oxidants..<br /><br />If only I stuck to eating it for recreational purposes too, 1g would last forever!

				About 100 mg codeine phosphate with an espresso chaser. Gets me comfortable and awake and next thing I know it&#039;s noon.

				It&#039;s called &quot;coffee&quot;.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to do drugs to get through the day. If you&#039;re so much of a loser that you constantly need drugs every day, then you&#039;re an idiot.

				Kind of agree with beerismymuse, drugs and work dont really mix, no matter how much of a superman they make you feel, your work does suffer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been a speed freak, and that ended up being a disaster at work, ended up punching out the boss (he was such an Arsehole people are still buying me drinks after 15 years).<br /><br />I have been into ice for last six months, sure it keeps you awake for 24-36 hours (my job requires this sometimes), OK as long as you are doing menial, repititous work, but if required to think, take 12 hours sleep and a decent feed before you even think about it.<br /><br />Drugs are for fun, not for getting through the day, if your job is that bad you need something everything day, time to move on

				Guys who say coffee or caffeine is the best one, dont you realize it causes SHITLOADS of anxiety?<br />OP stated he was struggling with anxiety during the work, so why make it worse?<br /><br />My 2cents thou:<br />Was wondering, what about heavy dose of caffeine 400mg or even more (in pills ofc since cofee/tea/coke/w,e is bullshit) <br />with 10mg valium? <br />Shouldnt make you sleepy from valium and should take anxiety away from caffeine while giving u all the energy/motivation etc, THEORETICALLY<br /><br />sorry if this sounds retarded or im stupid enough to not know basic shit, but was just wondering, anyone tried this? or any known interactions/reasons why this would NOT work?<br />Thx<br />

				When I had to do boring, repetitive work for ten hours + per day, I found hydrocodone to be a wonderful friend, I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called - percocet or vicodin. Wait - sorry, just remembered, they&#039;re tough on the liver. My mate swore by Xanax,&nbsp; he reckoned that once you develop a bit of a tolerance you can function well without nodding off. Good luck.

				What about modafinil?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I hear it&#039;s like caffeine and amphetamine, except without the negative effects and addictive properties of those drugs.
