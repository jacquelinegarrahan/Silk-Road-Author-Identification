				No no, these were dried shrooms, my mate is suicidal so he is spending time with me until I can knock some sense into him. I told him the wonders of psychedelics and next thing I know he downs ALL MY SHROOMS (400 USD worth). Right now he is talking to the cat about Plato and the Illuminate so I say they are affecting him.

				They were YOUR shrooms? Wow, what a dick. Suicidal or not<br /><br />I was absolutely fucked off of 13g of shrooms (So fucked that I haven&#039;t done shrooms since cause they terrify me so much haha) so I&#039;m eager to hear how this goes. If they were good shrooms, expect him to possibly curl up in a corner mumbling stuff to himself or the exact opposite: running around yelling shit. Ive had some pretty weird experiences with friends of mine that did shrooms, hopefully yours doesnt get too out of hand.<br /><br />Holy fuck though, an Oz? Good luck brah :-\

				Oh boy... him being suicidal fucks things as he will be going into the trip with an already screwed up mentality (SET, which is 90% of the trip imo). Just make sure he doesn&#039;t do anything stupid- he won&#039;t die from eating the shrooms but if he thinks he can fly that might cause some problems.. But yeah, aplrozolam can help. If that&#039;s not available maybe some shots will put him to sleep

				That&#039;s a lot.<br />I want to say keep him indoors, but you can&#039;t really &quot;make&quot; him do anything without risking a bad trip.&nbsp; Gently persuade him to do things, if you can I guess.<br />He won&#039;t die or anything, he just has to wait it out, and from time to time, may need to be reminded that he&#039;s just on drugs and will come down eventually.<br />I find most really bad trips involve people who think they&#039;re going to be &quot;stuck that way&quot; or feel like they&#039;re &quot;dying.&quot;

				The best part is were he is talking to the cat about Plato. ;D<br />Now I really need to try the tryptamines and lay aside the phenethylamines for a while even though I only started two months ago with LSD and I have the feeling that I did not explore it even 5%. Only had two LSD experiences in total so that makes sense.
