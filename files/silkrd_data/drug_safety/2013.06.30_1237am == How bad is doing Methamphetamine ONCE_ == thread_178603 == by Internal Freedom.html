				Hey guys, so I recently acquired some extremely pure meth off of a trusted vendor on the road. I only bought a sampler so I don&#039;t have a lot to work with. I have dozens of experiences with LSD, Shrooms, DMT, MDMA, and Coke as well as trying 2C-B, LSA, 25i-NBOMe, Ketamine, and Nitrous several times. Im not new to the drug scene but Meth still kinda creeps me out. All I see are horror stories when I try to do research on it and even the coke addicts in my area are terrified by it.<br /><br />Like everything else that I have tried, I want to see what its like for its own unique experience. I want to try it but I have no idea how much damage it will do to my body if I do it once or possibly twice. I didn&#039;t buy enough to do it any more then three times, and I have a very non-addictive personality. I can do coke for an entire week then completely stop with no cravings (same with tobacco). I&#039;m not worried about the addictive potential, just the damage.<br /><br />Is anyone aware of how much damage say 20-30mg of pure methamphetamine will do to me if I only do it once? I have a feeling it will most likely be nothing but you can never be too sure when dealing with stuff this hard.

				unlike the other substances you have tried (except MDMA), meth causes brain damage.<br /><br />Also meth is dirty...prescription ampehtamines (adderall, dexedrine) are higher quality, safer, and give you basically the same high... plus they are not as neurotoxic.<br /><br />Meth is overrated. psychedelics and MDMA give a far better experience than anything I&#039;ve felt with meth.... <br /><br />Plus meth has a harsh come-down. Sometimes makes me suicidally depressed.

				Taken pills cut with meth and snorted meth before. It&#039;s alright, interesting high but I prefer MDMA or alcohol over Meth. Maybe a little meth is good if you plan to party all night or fuck like crazy.

				If it really is only once well then its fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s super available/cheap/good in my area so I&#039;ve dabbled a few times but I guess I don&#039;t really enjoy it that much.&nbsp; I would def recommend some benzo&#039;s for the come down .&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t find meth to even really be addictive or a big deal.&nbsp; I probably do it twice a year however not every one can say that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lost several friends to meth, except its different than losing friends to H.&nbsp; A methhead doesn&#039;t usually OD and die, it just turns you crazy from lack of sleep and completely ruins your personality.&nbsp; Its not as big a deal as people say it is but it is also a substance to be treated with respect and used in extreme moderation.

				You may be right.&nbsp; This was quite a few years ago.&nbsp; After some meth binges and returns to baseline, I just distinctly recall that first twinge of the screw turning in my brain that made me &#039;want&#039; to do meth when I didn&#039;t really &#039;want&#039; to do it.&nbsp; It felt more &#039;physical&#039; than &#039;psychosomatic&#039; but these are nebulous terms.&nbsp; The best way I can recall it is a screw turning in my brain.&nbsp; Far from irresistible, but completely alarming.&nbsp; I decided to put it down at that point.<br /><br />I have experienced moderate opioid WDs and would agree that this was nothing like that.&nbsp; Those frozen turkey bumps and complete inability to regulate body temp are a whole separate realm.<br /><br />Fortunately I have never experienced alcohol or benzo WD symptoms, which I understand to be even worse.<br /><br />Someone here that knows more about meth will likely weigh in.

				Honestly the worst part of meth and any stimulant is the crash. You will end up feeling like shit when it starts to wear off and you will want to sleep but be unable to. I would have some benzos handy for the crash.<br /><br />Doing it once (as long as you don&#039;t OD) wont do any permanent damage, its when things like this are abused that they show there toxic side.

				Really? Would the comedown really be that rough? Ive had some pretty bad coke comedowns but I just end up getting really tired for an hour or two then I&#039;m ok.<br /><br />Ive never taken any Benzos before, them along with opiates Ive just never been interested in trying. No specific reason, I just never had the desire to do them. Ill try and order some Diazepam then, would that be the best? Or Xanax or something<br /><br />My &quot;idea&quot; was to do 25mg of meth at this rave coming up, my psychedelic tolerance is completely fucked right now so I cant do acid.

				Meth is fine. There have been many times I have used it multiple times a week and then stopped for months and months at a time. Though, this is me, I am not easily addicted to substances.<br /><br />People always complain about the come-down but I personally find all negative comedown side effects can be avoided by forcing yourself to eat. DO NOT SKIP MEALS even if you don&#039;t feel like eating.<br /><br />Meth, does not cause &#039;brain damage&#039;. Brain damage is caused by staying up all night for days, and skipping meals for days, which will happen very easily if you do meth constantly. One all nighter is not going to hurt you any more than staying up all night playing your favorite video game. <br /><br />Also, water is part of a meal! Drink a LOT of water and eat LOTS of food. You can avoid 100% of the &#039;comedown&#039; if you follow these simple instructions. The comedown is nothing more than your brain using up all it&#039;s reserves since meth is more or less enhancing your metabolism by a ton. The comedown in essence, is not caused by the meth, but is caused by not eating and drinking enough. I personally hate eating food on my meth experiences, so I always have protein drinks handy, they are very easy to consume when you don&#039;t feel like eating.<br /><br />Eat and Drink enough and the only bad effects you will have is being very tired near the end. Don&#039;t think that just because you can defeat the come-down that it is safe to do multiple times per week.... your brain needs a few days to recover after a Meth/speed &#039;trip&#039;<br /><br />--<br /><br />Oh I should add, have a reason for doing it. If you ever start to feel like you want to do it just to do it, or just to make your day fun/more productive, then DON&#039;T. If you start noticing any irrational urges to do it, simply don&#039;t, put it down and walk away. Me personally, in my peak I would do it once per week for parties, during my using time. I of course would want to do more the following days just to make the day fun, for the fuck of it, but I had forced myself to have rules in place to avoid ending up a junkie. Be disciplined with your drug use, is all I can say.

				I recently tried Meth, having started 5 years ago on Ritalin (as an adult ADHD patient), then a year later Adderall, then a year later looking for additional Adderall on line, and finding Silk Road. Now almost 18 months later and countless grams of Dutch Amphetamine, up to the two top Amph vendors, I was sent a free sample of Meth, and had heard all the &quot;neurotoxic&quot; propaganda. - Well the first try was definitely better than Amphetamine. <br /><br />From June 1st until tonight, I&#039;ve gone through 2 grams of Meth, with 2 grams of Amphetamine on week two. - The strangest part is, my most recent order of Meth, was some pretty clean stuff. Very low body load. I truly was waiting for some unpleasantness to occur, so I could just go back to my normal Amphetamine ways. <br /><br />It&#039;s just not getting bad for me. In fact, I find I can take Meth as I would a prescription. Although I recommend taking it orally. Either put it in a capsule, or take some shards, equivalent to no more than 30mg&#039;s to start, and put it on the back of your tongue, and drink your favorite beverage. ( I like to take it with a cold beer!). As far as hydrating and protein shakes. Sure, that&#039;s good if you really think you&#039;re depriving your body of those nutrients. <br />You&#039;ll get thirsty anyway, so just be sure to have some on hand. <br /><br />For this Adult ADD sufferer, Meth seems tamer than regular Amphetamine or Adderall (mixed salts of Amphetamine)<br /><br />I feel way too normal on Meth, so maybe it&#039;s just meant for me. - Desoxyn is the brand name for prescription Meth which is prescribed to children as young as 6. <br /><br />So U think Meth has been ridiciulously demonized, since it hit America&#039;s heartland so badly. That was also some low grade shit made out there in cook sites a-la &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m going to keep taking my Meth daily, like a pill, in 30-50mg doses. - <br /><br />I feel as long as I don&#039;t smoke it or snort it, it is a beneficial drug. All the hype about how bad it is, is just that. Hype. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also taken Heroin once a month since being able to try it for the 1st time on SR. I find Heroin less addictive than Lortab, and Oxydodone. <br /><br />I say, try anything once. - I&#039;m sure I burned out more receptors on Amphetamine. I don&#039;t understand all the bad rap Meth gets now that I&#039;ve tried it. <br /><br />I even can go off it for a few days, and I might need some extra sleep the first few days, but then I feel normal. <br /><br />- You won&#039;t know until you&#039;ve tried. <br /><br />I&#039;d keep it to a 20mg dose to start, then step it up after an hour, if you&#039;re not where you&#039;d thought you&#039;d be. <br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />Chip

				Everyone is so extremely bias when it comes to Meth use. One side hates it and wants nothing to do with it, the other side loves it and uses it all the time.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s that fine line in the middle of people who use it responsibly, know the risks and know it can fuck up their lives and bodies if they let their usage get out of control.<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not looking to pursue meth as a substance. I have an undesirable urge to try every substance/drug on SR to see each drugs own individual effects. That&#039;s why instead of just doing shrooms a hundred times I like a little variation of LSD, Shrooms, 25i, 2C-B, DMT, Peyote etc... I just clearly don&#039;t want to fuck myself up while doing this experimenting.<br /><br />I&#039;m not interested in opiates such as heroin RIGHT NOW, but I have little to no doubt I will try them within the next few years. I don&#039;t even know what an opiate buzz is like...<br /><br />I think I will end up trying Meth, I mean I have it already so I might as well use it. A lot of people here have convinced me, ill most likely throw 20mg in a gel cap and see what its like. I wanted to experience the &quot;rushing&quot; which I have heard isn&#039;t as obvious when taking it orally, but I also know smoking it is terrible for you.<br /><br />Thanks for the help guys :-)

				IMHO never give much respect to someone who says &quot;holy shit don&#039;t EVER do that specific drug EVEN ONCE!&quot;&nbsp; This just strikes me as pretty anti-libertarian and irrational as well.&nbsp; You hear this quite a bit regarding meth and heroin, even on these forums.<br /><br />This just doesn&#039;t reconcile as a rational statement to me.&nbsp; And I have used, abused and been dependent on many different drugs (not all at the same time!) for 10+ years.<br /><br />Some of you may think that second statement disqualifies the first one.&nbsp; That is fair.&nbsp; But I would guess the clear majority on these forums can feel me on the first statement.<br /><br />Do your homework, be safe, be smart, either avoid dependence or be mindful of what you are getting yourself into.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ignorance is dangerous, especially when &#039;kids&#039; (of all ages) have access to things like SR now.

				I&#039;d recommend you to snort it,since it&#039;s much more effective: when meth is taken the oral route a big part of it gets metabolized to normal amphetamine before reaching the brain<br />20-30 mg snorted should be enough to experience some rushing for a first timer, I don&#039;t think 20mg oral would be enough to experience meth at its fullest<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not huge about snorting stuff, never have been to be honest. I heard how ridiculously painful it is to snort meth so I never even considered that as an option. I snorted cut MDMA a while ago which was a terrible idea, I had my hands over my face for about five minutes trying to take my mind off of the intense pain forming in my nostrils.<br /><br />As bad as smoking it is, I think I would greatly prefer it over snorting. I imagine I would probably still get some rushing with the same amount (when smoked) too.<br /><br />nitpi, you have the same personality as everyone I know haha. I was at a party and everyone was doing fat lines of coke, then someone brings up meth and all of a sudden everyone starts talking about how they&#039;ll never try it, and if any of their friends try it they&#039;ll disown them.<br /><br />Which is most likely why ill be keeping this a secret from them :P Aside from you lovely people on SR..

				i find snorting mdma to be much more uncomfortable than meth<br /><br />smoking isnt really too bad damage wise,but don&#039;t hold the vapor for more than 2-4 sec after inhaling(holding the smoke like you would after taking a hit off a bong can fuck your lungs really bad) and brush your teeth and wash your mouth afterwards<br /><br />alternatively you could also plug it if you&#039;d be up for that(it&#039;s not as bad as one would imagine), its the second most effective ROA behind IV administration<br /><br />personally I only ever plugged meth once because i had prepared a shot to IV but decided not to after all, I usually snort, sometimes smoke/IV it (I don&#039;t use meth very often, maybe twice a month on average in 2013)

				From my recollection ca. 1999 usage, snorting meth was certainly painful but in a very appropriate way.&nbsp; If anyone is a fan of the character &quot;Tuco&quot; on Breaking Bad they can probably dig this concept.

				I can do meth intravenously, and&nbsp; most of the time i do it that way. The potential for addiction is not that big with it, the rush just feels short and kinda chemical but pleasurable (your heart rate goes up and you kinda feel like there&#039;s happy chemicals just raining down on your brain lol can&#039;t explain it any other way - unlike heroin where you get warmth - nothing better in cold winters or cocaine where you get bellringer so intense you think you&#039;re dying). Eating it would definetely be safe and i doubt it would be euphoric. <br /><br />In high doses - the ones you need to do to get good euphoria you can&#039;t eat, can&#039;t sleep - well hardly, and you will get terrible psychological comedown - to the point where you kinda just lay on your bed and can&#039;t do anything. It doesn&#039;t get better for me - using like 1-4 times in two months.<br /><br />Also does anyone know why meth smells like cut grass ? I always tought it smells green lol.

The magical mood and euphoria are just major pluses for me. Only with the real deal holyfield will you feel the goodness of it. All the shit thats stepped hard with msm is basically all the ups, minus the goodness, plus angst and noia. <br /><br />I often cap some, eat it, forget about it, crawl into work, then before i know it, im superman on the table saw, lol. Today the moment i woke i snorted roughly 20-50mg, burned 5 hours sanding furniture like it was 5 min, anddd, i enjoyed every moment of it, haha.<br /><br />&nbsp;With meth, you can fucking forget about food. At least till its been a full 8-12 hrs and your body NEEDS it. The difference forcing some crackers and water down makes is unreal, as far as comfort and an over all pleasurable experience goes.<br /><br />Sleep you say??? HAA! is my response, LOL. I could have came down from the buzz at say 2pm for example, fucking physically EXHAUSTED, and still wont be able to &#039;shut my mind off&#039; for sleep till fucking damn near midnight. The shit is rocket fuel. Perfect case &amp; point, is me, right now. I got my order yesterday at 2ish, did a residue line(w.e shook out the bags when splitting and weighing it), It couldnt have been more than 5-10mg. I was buzzn hard for like four hours, then could not sleep till 5am, had worked a 9 hr day full of heavy lifting. Then got 2 hours of semi-sleep before work this AM. Did that 20-50mg line. Worked like the flash for 9 hrs straight, no lunch, no breaks. Only cigs, redbull and water of coarse, important to keep hydrated, as it dryss you the fuuck out. Did a booster dose, maybe 20mg at about 130pm...as of right now, on ZERO food, hardly any sleep and loads of hard labor, i feel like a million bucks, arguing with the voices in my head about how do NOT NEED another snap. LMFAO.<br /><br />In conclusion, my original statement stands firm. METH IS AND CAN BE A MAGICAL FUCKING SUBSTANCE, IF AND WHEN USED WITH CARE. Mind you, it is very, very easy to do far more than you need, just to keep that euphoric happy go lucky empathetic buzz running strong. If one has will power, knows when enough is enough, regardless of how bad you want it, or think you need it, one can discover one of the most useful drugs known to man. Much love people, Biscuitz, over &amp; out. 8)<br /><br />EDIT: @grdr, to my nose it usually smells kind of fishy. The good shit anyway. Maybe i can see where you get freshly cut grass, hehe.

				I did 15mg oral (first time ever doing it). No euphoria really, I got a lot of shit done though. Finished a ton of work I needed to do and cleaned up most of my room. Going to try smoking it next, still looking for that rush I have heard about.<br /><br />NO comedown on the 15mg taken orally. I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />But then again I don&#039;t get MDMA or coke comedowns, so maybe that&#039;s just normal for me.

				Doing meth once isn&#039;t a big deal.<br /><br />I was on adderall for over a year and since prices on SR got crazy I switched to meth pills (HQ). Took them for&nbsp; weeks daily (dosage gave me a feeling like 100mg adderall) so I took one half at noon and one half about 6 hours later. The high was great but I started to get really bad mental withdrawals when skipping a day. Also minor (very minor) psychotic episodes where I would wake up (movie playing in the background) and be like really paranoid for 20 seconds. Went to the doctor, gave me three weeks to get my head back to normal and I guess i&#039;m sticking with ritalin from now on. Adderall feels nicer but you sweat all the time and the tolerance curve is just ridiculous. Went from 20 mg/day to 80mg/day in one year.... so.... things like that can&#039;t end well. <br /><br />&nbsp;
