				So I have tried speedball of cocaine and heroin, I liked it but meth + heroin (meth is powder)&nbsp; was just awful. First the&nbsp; rush - i tried a bit meth before rush was great from meth alone. then meth+heroin rush was awful i started feeling meth heart rate going up and then on my back this warmth from heroin which felt not good. Then the high kinda felt like I&#039;m not high from meth too much - without heroin I would be - I&#039;m not high from heroin at all just warm. Then after a while I started throwing up - I don&#039;t use heroin nor meth everyday so I HOPE this is usual heroin throwing up and not feeling heroin comedown due to meth long high, I always don&#039;t like powder meth but there&#039;s no other option in this country.<br /><br />So yeah not so good experience... I also HATE throwing my food up in the toilet I don&#039;t understand why I come back to that shit .

				Write something, your opinions about speedballs and so on. As I mentioned in earlier threads meth + midazolam/ diazepam goes great. You just need to have injectable vials... These benzos kinda takes the edge off in a good way if you want more relaxing high.<br /><br /><br />Cocaine - shoot cocaine until you had enough bellringerrs and when you want to end a session do cocaine/heroin. never repeat speedball shot until heroin wears off because thats how people OD - cocaine running out, too much heroin in your system. KEEP IN MIND that these two seem to potentiate each other. So if you see you won&#039;t get a good ringer from your leftover coke and have heroin mix them up !

				I find amphetamines and heroin a bad mixture. Not compatible at all. I also find that speed feels like it is ripping the heroin from my system leaving me sick.<br /><br />Still, we all try these things once eh!<br />

				When I was IVing I did enjoy the incredible rush from meth &amp; heroin but found it far too rough on my body, heart felt like it was going to explode and gave me tons of body pain after, really brutal nausea as well. I always liked cocaine &amp; heroin better, but it&#039;s been 4.5 years since I&#039;ve IV&#039;d anything.
