			<dd class="postbody">
				I tried to make the short version as specific as possible. There are several pictures in the text and 2 videos at the very bottom. I uploaded a video to demonstrate the difference between using a pipe made of thick glass and a pipe made of thinner glass.<br />Any questions or suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I hope this tutorial is easy for everyone to understand. :D<br /><br />THE SHORT VERSION:<br /><br />Drop an amount of meth into the bowl of your glass pipe, or your lightbulb.<br />Hold your Bic lighter below your pipe, the tip of the flame should be about 1cm away from the glass. Do not touch the glass with the flame.<br /><br />http://s23.postimg.org/syyr5410r/IMG_4923.png<br /><br />The meth will melt into a liquid and begin to evaporate. When it starts to smoke, roll the stem of the pipe between your thumb and index finger, back and forth while inhaling through the stem.<br />If you notice your meth is boiling, you&#039;re getting it too hot &amp; it will not evaporate. Pull the flame away a little, or roll your pipe faster. The goal is to keep the meth at about 200 °C, careful not to heat it above 215 °C(it&#039;s boiling point.)<br />It will take some practice, but once you get the hang of it it becomes almost automatic.<br />Have fun. :)<br /><br /><br />THE LONG VERSION:<br /><br />Smoking meth is not an easy task to learn, but well worth it. To begin, you&#039;ll want to drop a shard or a small pile of powder into your bowl. If you are just learning this technique, I recommend starting by loading your bowl with a pile of powder the size of your pinky fingernail, or a small shard of about the same size.<br /><br />Grab your lighter (preferably a plain, old Bic lighter.) and hold it about an inch below your pipe keeping the tip of the flame about 1cm away from the glass.<br /><br />http://s23.postimg.org/syyr5410r/IMG_4923.png<br /><br />A Bic lighter is the best lighter you can use, some people use torches, I never have, but I think they are far too hot. The point is not to actually &quot;burn&quot; the meth and make smoke, but to vaporize it. The white &quot;smoke&quot; you inhale is the concentrated methamphetamine in the form of vapor. There are 2 kinds of vaporization, boiling and evaporation. Boiling is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place below the surface of a liquid and occurs at the liquid&#039;s boiling point. Evaporation is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place at the surface of the liquid at a temperature that allows the meth to condense into vapor without being destroyed.<br /><br />The melting point of methamphetamine is around 171 °C - 175 °C. The boiling point of methamphetamine is close to 215 °C. So, the reason we roll the pipe back and forth between our fingers is to keep our meth from boiling and being destroyed. The goal is to keep our little liquid meth puddle at about 200 °C. You may also notice that the meth will &quot;move away&quot; from the hottest areas of your pipe, toward the cooler areas where it can remain in liquid form. Another goal of rolling the meth pipe between your fingers is to chase the meth around the glass and force it to evaporate.<br /><br />Normally, the 1st few hits of meth will taste bad, because most meth has been cut with adulterants that have a lower flash point than methamphetamine. If your 1st hit tastes fine, then you have very pure methamphetamine. Some people (including myself) will blow the first hit or two out of the pipe to clear the meth of whatever it&#039;s cut with, but that&#039;s a matter of preference. With each hit you take, it is absolutely normal for your meth puddle to turn a beige color, and sometimes even brown. It will begin to taste worse and worse as it gets darker, and yes, you are burning the meth, but you can still smoke the yucky brown puddle if you want to.<br /><br />When your meth begins to turn brown, try to take smaller hits by pulling the flame away sooner, or holding the flame farther away from your pipe. The thickness of the glass your pipe is made of will make all of your experiences different. The pipes I sell are made of thick glass, it takes a little bit longer to take a proper hit from one of them than it would if you were using a light bulb. If your pipe is made of thing glass, or IS a light bulb, your meth will heat much faster and you will have to roll your pipe between your fingers much faster to keep the temperature regulated. I prefer the thicker glass, because I feel like it gives me more control, but your opinions may be different.<br /><br />This video demonstrates the use of a small, thin pipe:<br />(I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS LINK TO WORK ON THE CLEARNET, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK)<br /><br />http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4508/mpmw.mp4<br /><br /><br />I hope this tutorial helps, and if there is anywhere that I need to improve it, let me know. ;D<br />

				I would add, though... I hold my vapor in much longer. I know this is a point of debate amongst some folks, but it certainly won&#039;t crystallize your lungs (which is the most common protest I hear). I figure, if I&#039;m going to be smoking chemicals, I might as well get my money&#039;s worth out of them. Plus a huge rip, held in, can give you a nice rush.

				I typically hold it in between 5 - 7 seconds, just cause I read that whatever is going to be absorbed will have been absorbed by that time. It&#039;s definitely a matter of preference. :)<br /><br />But yeah, I hate that myth! Meth will NOT recrystallize in your lungs, people!<br /><br />Thanks for the positive responses, everyone! I felt that this was something many people had been wondering, and describing it in words is too difficult.

				I have participated a few times actually. What most people dont realize is that it does take some degree of knowledge 2 smoke meth out of a bubble properly. Keep rollin it so you dont burn the dope cause it will taste bad and make your pipe hard 2 clean.......NEVER touch the flame 2 the glass like you see on TV. The preferred lighter is bic. If you dont roll and light properly it is possible 4 you 2 burn up all the drugs without getting a hit! BTW, try not 2 be the first person 2 hit a freshly packed bubble unless you know the difference between cut and dope. Since the first person has 2 burn off some cut b4 they hit, if not it tastes really bad.<br /><br />The actually process of smoking meth gets alot of people more hooked on it just because its like an event.

				Crack is similar. You don&#039;t want to burn it but rather heat up the liquid enough to vaporize. You can get hits like that off a stem if you do it right. <br />I&#039;ve never properly smoked meth. :( Only snort and IV so far. I should pick up one of those pipes to try it out when I get some btc. Video makes my brain tingle like a contact high.

				If you wanna smoke meth like the dope dudes I used 2 smoke with here is what they do.......<br /><br /><br />They get a 12 inch bubble or about that size.......<br /><br />Then they bend it in2 a V so it fits in2 a BONG.<br /><br />Get a rubber gasket place it around the area where the bend in the v and the bong connect<br /><br />fill the bong with a good beverage that DOES NOT CONTAIN SUGAR<br /><br />then slap the bowl full of like a half gram. <br /><br />Then light it with a propane tourch, a mapp gass torch often explodes the bubbble.<br /><br />I have seen people pass out b4 they exhaled you get so fucking tweaked............its like the first time you smoked

				PriscillaMarie90 thank you for this post. i dont do meth often and i am honestly glad it is not available in the area because of its addictive potential, but sr is perfect because i can&#039;t fiend and get it the next day so i dont even waste time ordering because i know by the time it comes urge is gone but yeah thank you priscilla because i realized i wasted almost everything i had last time and now im trying your method and it is great. its hard getting the exact time to pull the lighter before it boils but im getting the hang of it. thanks for the advice and hope your feeling better. i remember there was a post a while ago when you were down in the dumps

				Ahaha I love you guys! :)<br /><br />greenalice:<br />Thank YOU! And you&#039;re welcome! :D Most people agree that big white clouds are very wasteful, but I think they&#039;re the most fun! It&#039;s just satisfying to exhale that&nbsp; thick, warm vapor. ;D<br /><br />marsvolta12:<br />Thank you, and yes I&#039;m feeling better. ;D I&#039;ve gained some control over my life and my meth use, so things are looking better.<br /><br />mito:<br />I have snorted meth, I used to only snort meth until I bought my first pipe lol.. To be honest I really PREFER the effects of snorting meth over the effects of smoking it, the euphoria lasts much longer, I&#039;m not constantly craving to use more, it&#039;s just warm, happy energy for hours and hours. I really don&#039;t understand why the craving to smoke it is so strong, when you smoke it the euphoria only lasts like 30 minutes but the energy is with you for hours, so you chase the euphoria &amp; end up not sleeping for days... Lol! It&#039;s just frustrating because your brain is like &quot;COME ON I WANNA SMOKE SOME METH GET THAT PIPE OUT BITCH&quot; and I&#039;m like &quot;But whyyyy!&quot;<br />Ahaha okay not really, but some of you probably know what I mean. Recently I have cut back my meth use quite a bit, and on days that I do use it I normally try to snort it. 1 line in the morning is usually enough to assuage me, but maybe once or twice a week I&#039;ll break the pipe out just so my brain will shut up, LOL! ;D<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />Have any of you guys ever tried to speak while you&#039;re exhaling a huge cloud of vapor? You ought to try it, like you inhale a giant hit and then just say something while you exhale, it&#039;s weird cause it makes your voice sound significantly lower &amp; you can kinda feel the vapor in your throat LOL<br />IT&#039;S COOL! IMITATE ME MY DARLINGS!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;3

Someone I talked to recently told me he put it in his coffee and would drink it, which I thought was kind of funny. If you like to eat meth, then go for it! :D Snorting it fucks up your nose REALLY BAD and it hurts horribly, and smoking it is very addictive. I won&#039;t tell you never to try the other routes of administration, because the euphoria is quite different, but be careful! :) &lt;3

				Eating it, is very strong.<br /><br />Smoking it gives great rushes, but totally turns you into a crack head, scrapping over the pipe and looking through the blinds.<br /><br />I personally like a smoke, but I think the trophy goes to the 1 ml rig. Get that head tingle, rush. Fucking amazing. Makes women literally orgasm sometimes. <br /><br />Quality like Hiesenburg deals has turned me into a believer. I&#039;ve spent my whole adult life struggling with opiate addiction and recovering with suboxone. Made it impossible to get high, and even when I get high it just brings back so many painful memories that it&#039;s just a depressing shitty time.<br /><br />Anyways, just started chipping meth as a weekend thing. Once every month or two. Was first getting some good &#039;ol boy shake n bake. This ICE IS NIGHT AND DAY. not even close. <br /><br />Always ran on foil tho, I bet i&#039;d be twirlin a pizzo tho. I&#039;m a big needle guy tho, everything else seems a waste.

				Hope I&#039;m not out of line here, but this thread&#039;s about proper smoking technique so here we go.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve only tried smoking crack once, and when I did I was told it was some of the best shit out there. Said it was called &quot;drop&quot;, IE you drop it straight in the pan, no cut. Maybe bullshit, but it was definitely crack nonetheless.<br /><br />Used one of those little metal one-and-a-half-hitters, put a screen in the bottom, and smoked it like a bowl of weed, taking the biggest hits I could without burning myself on the hot motherfucker.<br /><br />I felt almost nothing, so I&#039;m assuming I did this extremely wrong.

				Man, you either torched the shit out of it (5% chance) or the crack was bad (95%). I&#039;ve smoked coke, not the base though, as well as shot it. Coke rush is what crack is all about. Some seconds are all they get but its time to put on the moon boots. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if its just me but I just don&#039;t get why crack heads havent made the switch. They might even be able to get a job, instead of fighting to hold onto 20$ minutes, you get 20$ day or two lol. <br /><br />Dude, being a slave to OC and its terrible 8-12 hr duration was hell. I could not imagine having to stress on the hour by the hour. Wish there was a suboxone equivalent to crack so some of those poor souls can get some rest. West side Chi; you got a dime, dollar, food, water, sock, cig, man you got ANYTHINGGGGG? :(<br /><br />I always toss a cig to anybody who is polite. And then the guy that catches me at that perfect moment b/w home and dope spot on a GREAT week/mo, I&#039;ll spoil the shit out of em, when I get to casually know them. Sometimes life will throw you a punch and knock your ass out. Whether you deserved it or not, I have nothing to complain about (and how dare I even think to) when they worry about cold, shelter, food, drugs on the daily. I can look at a man, who is vile now but I don&#039;t see them only as them now, most started off like the rest of society, then one problem stacked and compounded and thats the end result. <br /><br />Ive met folks who do it to rebel from society, as well as the bond. Ive seen some so lost mentally it saddens me. So next time you snear at the crackhead that wants to steal everything you own as quick as humanly possible. Understand that there was a soul deep in there, one pushed to the limit, far removed from himself. Tired enough to lay his own soul down. But not before that last hit of crack.<br /><br />Remember there is no such thing as leftover crack.<br /><br />

				PriscillaMarie90,<br />Thank you for uploading this video and detailing the smoking technique. Unfortunately, I am unabled to watch the video now so i wanted to ask you for some clarification so i can benefit from your expertise in smoking.<br /><br />Background:<br />Just started smoking el meth from the glass bubble. I have gotten one amazing hit by accident where it seemed like the whole rock instantly sublimated. Hitting the glass ball properly remind me of golf, to hit the ball straight and long you need finesse. I got that one lucky hit, and i was geeking off a whole shard. However, normally when i hit it, i try to gently bring the meth to melting point and then apply spin to the glass to evenly heat the meth and slowly inhale. <br /><br />Can you please provide more technical specifics about how the technique works?I have been enjoying the energy and buzz but i want the geeking effect from a whole sublimated shard.<br />Also, i notice that the first few hits taste fine, but by the end the meth is discoloured brown, tastes like craps, and leaves an grimy residue.

Could this be due to my use of a butane torch?<br /><br />Any Assistance is Greatly Appreciated,<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ll try to answer the best I can. <br /><br />You&#039;re right, there really is a technique to smoking meth. It&#039;s almost impossible to teach someone, you just kind of have to learn it. Eventually your fingers seem to do everything themselves, without requiring much thought on your part, but until you really learn it, it can seem like such a chore. I think that&#039;s why smoking meth becomes addicting too, because it&#039;s almost like an event<br /><br />Okay, so....<br />The reason we roll the pipe between our fingers is to keep the meth at a constant temperature. The point is not to actually &quot;burn&quot; the meth and make smoke, the point is to vaporize it. The white &quot;smoke&quot; you inhale is the concentrated methamphetamine in the form of vapor. There are 2 kinds of vaporization, boiling and evaporation. Boiling is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place below the surface of a liquid and occurs at the liquid&#039;s boiling point. Evaporation is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place at the surface of the liquid, below the boiling point.<br /><br />When meth boils, it is destroyed. When meth is evaporated, we can properly inhale the concentrated vapor and achieve the intended effects. The melting point of methamphetamine is around 171 °C - 175 °C. The boiling point of methamphetamine is close to 215 °C. So, to keep our meth from boiling and being destroyed, the goal is to keep our little liquid meth puddle at about 200 °C. By the way, I would recommend using a Bic lighter to heat your meth, not a butane torch. A butane torch has a valve designed to release a fast, constant flow of butane, of which 100% is ignited. A regular lighter has a smaller valve, which releases butane in a weak, inconstant stream, and less of the fuel is ignited, thus a cooler flame. It will take longer using a cooler flame to bring the methamphetamine to it&#039;s melting point, but it is far easier to control the temperature of the methamphetamine once it begins to vaporize. You may also notice that the meth will &quot;move away&quot; from the hottest areas of your pipe, toward the cooler areas where it can remain in liquid form. Another goal of rolling the meth pipe between your fingers is to chase the meth around the glass and force it to evaporate.<br />Here is a picture of *about* how far away your flame should be from the glass:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/003.JPG.1197959466.jpg<br /><br />Normally, the 1st few hits of meth will taste bad, because most meth has been cut with adulterants that have a lower flash point than methamphetamine. If your 1st hit tastes fine, then you have very pure methamphetamine. I usually load my pipe, melt &amp; vaporize the meth, and blow through the stem of the pipe to blow the vapor out the hole in the bowl. Since it&#039;s just an adulterant anyway, it&#039;s of no use to me, though I&#039;m sure there is some meth vapor wasted. It is absolutely normal for your meth puddle to turn a beige color, and sometimes even brown. It will begin to taste worse and worse as it gets darker, and yes, you are burning the meth, but you can still smoke the yucky brown puddle if you want to. <br />Here is a picture of some meth in my pipe that is pretty burned, next to the normal color that meth should be in your pipe:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/k_003.JPG<br /><br />When your meth begins to turn brown, try to take smaller hits by pulling the flame away sooner, or holding the flame farther away from your pipe. The thickness of the glass your pipe is made of will change your experience DRAMATICALLY. The pipes I sell are made of thick glass, it takes a little bit longer to take a proper hit from one of them than it would if you were using a light bulb. If your pipe is made of thing glass, or IS a light bulb, your meth will heat much faster and you will have to roll your pipe between your fingers much faster to keep the temperature regulated.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to edit the 1st post of this thread with new videos &amp; information within the next few hours. I hope this helps you, if anyone has any more questions please post here and I&#039;ll do my best to get you a thorough answer.<br /><br />

				A hot rail does not involve foil in any way, shape or form...<br /><br />&nbsp;Also, vaporizing off foil, if done correctly with experienced technique, is actually the least wasteful of all methods (except IV of course) with 99.8% of the meth going into your lungs.

Just get those shards coming and I&#039;ll take a few days from work. It shouldn&#039;t take that long but ya gotta figure in the hours wasted doing stupid stuff, like looking up something to verify info just to end up with 50+ tabs open of crap that looked interesting, lol.

				Don&#039;t get the sarcasm? But yeah you can just go ahead and hold the pipe at the base (mouth piece) with your bare hand, it doesn&#039;t even get warm, cept maybe from your body heat. Your hitting the bubble with the torch.<br /><br />If your a little paranoid anyway, then hold the pipe with kitchen tongs, which most should have lying around.<br /><br />You can use bleach if you want, but I wouldn&#039;t want to. I guess that is preference, are you more afraid of fire or caustic chemicals. I personally prefer to torch it off cause all your doing is what you usually do to smoke, just much hotter, but taking a corrosive chemical and putting it into something you heat up and inhale vapor from into your lungs isn&#039;t appealing to me.<br /><br />Not to mention you really would need gloves to handle the bleach, and possible a container to pour it into, or at least a sink to do it over, not to mention what happens to your clothes if any splashes on them.<br /><br />Your not going to melt the pipe unless you continue to heat it after the stain is already been gone. I have made my own pipes many times by heating the end of a test tube until glowing and blowing a bubble with it.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to get snippy just cause someone happens to know more than you, I wasn&#039;t sarcastic or demeaning in my earlier post at all, but you took it personally somehow. Idk, I don&#039;t really care one way or the other, I&#039;m just posting in this section to share knowledge and hopefully benefit others.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll post a hot rail tutorial after I get off work tonight.

Melt it down to stick, tilt it downwards on an angle, heat till melts and when it runs down crease follow it underneath with the lighter, while inhaling the smoke from the end towards you. The smoke will follow up the foil until it get to your waiting straw at the end (if you do it right). Also you can easily vape a small shard in one to two hits off foil, if you keep getting alot of crack backs your not hitting it with the lighter high enough as it runs. Your looking for a thick plume of vapor with&nbsp; taste. Hold in your hit to not waste any especially if your taking huge hits. Not one wisp of smoke should not make it into your straw if your doing it right.<br /><br />Also, you can make a crude, temporary, and somewhat effective pipe out of a lightbulb if you want, google&#039;s instructions are good enough. <br /><br />I plan to add a pipe making guide using glass test tubes in my thread as well.<br /><br /><br />@priscilla- I owe you an apology about the bleach, tried it the other day when a novice, that claimed to know what he was doing, got ahold of my pipe and left me some nice blackish caked on residue, works well and quicker than torching.

				Pure methamphetamine HCl melts at around 170c (338f ). The crystals can be carefully chopped and mixed with sodium carbonate, and when the resulting powder is heated (and the methamphetamine HCl melts) CO2 and methamphetamine base vapor is given off. This is probably one of the more effective ways of smoking meth if you are careful, however the hydrochloride salt is often the form smoked as the base form is often an oil and is difficult to store, transport, and work with. Smoking the HCl form is OK if you don&#039;t mind a small quantity of pyrolysed drug.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/meth/meth_faq.shtml#synthesis<br /><br />Anyone tried this before? if it gets better value for money perhaps its the way we all should be smoking?

There are several pictures in the text and 2 videos at the very bottom. I uploaded 2 videos to demonstrate the difference between using a pipe made of thick glass and a pipe made of thinner glass.<br />Any questions or suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I hope this tutorial is easy for everyone to understand. :D<br /><br />THE SHORT VERSION:<br /><br />Drop an amount of meth into the bowl of your glass pipe, or your lightbulb.<br />Hold your Bic lighter below your pipe, the tip of the flame should be about 1cm away from the glass. Do not touch the glass with the flame.<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/003.JPG.1197959466.jpg<br /><br />The meth will melt into a liquid and begin to evaporate. When it starts to smoke, roll the stem of the pipe between your thumb and index finger, back and forth while inhaling through the stem.<br />If you notice your meth is boiling, you&#039;re getting it too hot &amp; it will not evaporate. Pull the flame away a little, or roll your pipe faster. The goal is to keep the meth at about 200 °C, careful not to heat it above 215 °C(it&#039;s boiling point.)<br />It will take some practice, but once you get the hang of it it becomes almost automatic.<br />Have fun. :)<br /><br /><br />THE LONG VERSION:<br /><br />Smoking meth is not an easy task to learn, but well worth it. To begin, you&#039;ll want to drop a shard or a small pile of powder into your bowl. If you are just learning this technique, I recommend starting by loading your bowl with a pile of powder the size of your pinky fingernail, or a small shard of about the same size.<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/007.JPG.1295928396.jpg<br /><br />Grab your lighter (preferably a plain, old Bic lighter.) and hold it about an inch below your pipe keeping the tip of the flame about 1cm away from the glass.<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/003.JPG.1197959466.jpg<br /><br />A Bic lighter is the best lighter you can use, some people use torches, I never have, but I think they are far too hot. The point is not to actually &quot;burn&quot; the meth and make smoke, but to vaporize it. The white &quot;smoke&quot; you inhale is the concentrated methamphetamine in the form of vapor. There are 2 kinds of vaporization, boiling and evaporation. Boiling is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place below the surface of a liquid and occurs at the liquid&#039;s boiling point. Evaporation is the transition of a liquid into a gas that takes place at the surface of the liquid at a temperature that allows the meth to condense into vapor without being destroyed.<br /><br />The melting point of methamphetamine is around 171 °C - 175 °C. The boiling point of methamphetamine is close to 215 °C. So, the reason we roll the pipe back and forth between our fingers is to keep our meth from boiling and being destroyed. The goal is to keep our little liquid meth puddle at about 200 °C. You may also notice that the meth will &quot;move away&quot; from the hottest areas of your pipe, toward the cooler areas where it can remain in liquid form. Another goal of rolling the meth pipe between your fingers is to chase the meth around the glass and force it to evaporate.<br /><br />Normally, the 1st few hits of meth will taste bad, because most meth has been cut with adulterants that have a lower flash point than methamphetamine. If your 1st hit tastes fine, then you have very pure methamphetamine. Some people (including myself) will blow the first hit or two out of the pipe to clear the meth of whatever it&#039;s cut with, but that&#039;s a matter of preference. With each hit you take, it is absolutely normal for your meth puddle to turn a beige color, and [bold]sometimes even brown. It will begin to taste worse and worse as it gets darker, and yes, you are burning the meth, but you can still smoke the yucky brown puddle if you want to[/bold<br /><br />Here is a picture of some meth in my pipe that is pretty burned, next to the normal color that meth should be in your pipe:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/k_003.JPG<br /><br />When your meth begins to turn brown, try to take smaller hits by pulling the flame away sooner, or holding the flame farther away from your pipe. The thickness of the glass your pipe is made of will make all of your experiences different. The pipes I sell are made of thick glass, it takes a little bit longer to take a proper hit from one of them than it would if you were using a light bulb. If your pipe is made of thing glass, or IS a light bulb, your meth will heat much faster and you will have to roll your pipe between your fingers much faster to keep the temperature regulated. I prefer the thicker glass, because I feel like it gives me more control, but your opinions may be different.<br /><br />This video demonstrates the use of a pipe with thinner glass than I normally use:<br />http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4508/mpmw.mp4<br /><br />And my regular, thicker pipe is being used in this video:<br />http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/6499/7rou.mp4<br /><br />I hope this tutorial helps, and if there is anywhere that I need to improve it, let me know. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Not to take anything away from Priscilla but this information is a wronger. Where I&#039;m from, now that simply doesn&#039;t mean that where I&#039;m from determines if something is correct or wrong, just based on experience you will burn your shit if you do it this way. I once used to smoke like this, but thru xp realized it&#039;s not correct. As you can see where it is bold, the reason it ends up this way is either the meths quality is bad or it is being burnt. And with a bic lighter, it will always get burnt. That flame is meant to be big and resist wind and all sorts of crazy shit. Far too powerful, fellas.<br /><br />---------<br />Do NOT USE a Bic lighter, but do use any lighter with adjustable flames. That&#039;s fine. With these lighters, you can blue-flame your bowl, which is to apply the flame directly to the bottom of the bowl so that the blue flame wraps the bottom portion of the bulb and barely, if any, orange flame is visible.<br /><br />Prior to this, I should&#039;ve mentioned; adjust the flame - not too small, not too huge. The thicker the bowl of your pipe, if it&#039;s real thick, I suggest using a torch flame held two inches or so away. Lighters can be used for thickies, but because you have to keep your flame applied longer it&#039;ll fuck up your lighter after awhile from overheating unless you use more than one and switch lighters between hits. If it&#039;s a thin to normal glass pipe, lighters [no zippos, no bics] are better.<br /><br />---------<br />Okay so blue-flame the bowl. Wait until you see smoke, then rock the bowl left and right. If you just loaded the bowl and this is first hit, you wanna re-crystalize it before taking that hit. So re-crystalize it by instead of inhaling, simply blow in it to &#039;clear the cut and cool&#039;, as well as use a damp rag on the spot you&#039;re lighting, always moving the pipe while you&#039;re rubbing it against the rag to cool it even more efficiently.<br /><br /><br />So wait until you see smoke, and when you do you can apply your lips tightly onto stem and begin inhaling SLOWLY. Pull slow, while always rocking every second. Keep flame on the bowl for about a 7-10 sec. duration of your hit. Then you can stop lighting, but still keep inhaling and rocking. You can rock every second, for example: 1, 2, 3 seconds = left, right, left etc. rocking motion. Or the way I do it is 1, 2, right, 3, 4, left, 5, 6, right...so about every 2 secondsish, rock it. Exhale and be prepared to get lost in the clouds.<br /><br />-------<br />Don&#039;t wait too long after you exhale to start cooling it. You wanna try and cool it ASAP after exhale.<br /><br />After this you can quickly blow into the top-hole of your bowl to cool it a bit until you grab your damp rag, sponge, whatever it is you use to cool. Always cool your bowl with a damp item. NOT SOAKING WET......but damp.....after each hit. Soaking wet and it could crack.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re using a torch for thicker pipes...don&#039;t blue flame that shit. That&#039;s something you hold about an inch of three away. And don&#039;t hold it directly toward the pipe for 7-10 seconds, more like little bursts of 2-4 seconds, while inhaling.<br /><br />--------<br />One thing you can do to check the quality is when it&#039;s already solidified and re-crystalized, hold the pipe up to a ceiling light or bright light and look at the patterns in the dope. If you use spiderweb, or more like pinwheels or windmills kind of shapes, it&#039;s a good good sign. Anything other than that pattern, like random irregular shapes and shit is cut, 90% of the time.<br /><br />----<br />I like to eat alot of cold beverages when I&#039;m runnin. And by eat cold bevs, things like smoothies with real fruits, etc. I&#039;m aware of what I&#039;m saying lol.&nbsp; Cold tings is good for the throat. Cough drops are good if you develop throat irritation or removing a bad taste. It&#039;s gonna be hard sometimes to develop an appetite but you gotta force yourself. One cure to eat is smoke some bud.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s all I got guys. Hope this helps. I posted this in the Meth Vendors too, well not exactly verbatim, but same general information.<br /><br /><br />Laterzzzzzz,<br />The Showcase

				I would also add, and maybe a video would be a good idea, that a small bowl of thick glass and a large bowl of thick glass are smoked differently. <br /><br />I find that it&#039;s up to someone&#039;s personal preference whether they want to use thin or thick glass, or small or big bowl. With thick glass, I recommend a butane torch lighter for minimum burning, as long as you realize that you have to keep the flame on for a much shorter period of time. <br /><br />But good video and good recommendations!

				I think it&#039;s cool to see how much longer the thick glass keeps the product smoking after the flame is taken away. If that aint a good reason to go with thick glass, I don&#039;t know what is.

				Just discovered a new (to me) method of vaping meth... quite similar a hot rail.<br /><br />Use a standard meth pipe with a ball at the end (small hole at the top for depositing the meth of course)...<br />Prepare a dose of meth - similar to one that you would use for a hot rail.. crush it up a bit but no need to make it as fine as the hot rail line, it can still contain some small crystals although you don&#039;t really want them to be any bigger than 2mm^3.<br /><br />Using a torch lighter (flame lighter will take too long), preheat the bottom area of the meth glass ball making sure that you move the jets around a lot so that a large surface is very hot - you want a similar, or slighter lower surface temp than a hot rail pipe.<br /><br />Get the pipe ready and place it near your mouth and exhale all the air in your lungs.<br />Drop the crushed meth and watch how it instantly turns to thick vapor.<br />Keep sucking in the vapor as you twirl the pipe around to keep spreading the molten meth.<br />If done right, you can easily vape 30mg in one go and fast enough to get it all in using one breath.<br /><br />Now sit back and get ready to have your face punched in!<br />:D

				Forgot I commented in here, but just remembered and took awhile to find it.<br /><br />Fellas, I have a question to all those using BIC lighters....does the shit turn brown after awhile? If it turns brown after 4 hits or just turns brown at all its because you&#039;re BURNING IT. True technique, along with high quality glass, the shit wouldn&#039;t turn brown...a creamish peach color at best, but it should stay creamy-white all the way through.<br /><br />Bic lighters, torches used wrong [holding it like you would a lighter], will mess your shit up AND leave a bad taste in your mouth. When it tastes like that, it&#039;s being overheated. I&#039;ve been smoking meth since 2005, since 17, albeit off and on, never everyday but I know my shit. I can go months without meth because I&#039;m a psychonaut [love shrooms, etc] / weed smoker at heart. Longest I&#039;ve gone was 7 months recently. Truth be told I only like it for gettin off / sex marathons with my girl [who does not smoke btw].<br /><br />Ok shit I&#039;m getting off track.<br /><br />When I first started, I used bics, I used whatevers, even with adjustable lighters I would hold a maxed-out flame 3 inches or so away...I was convinced I was smoking right. Until one day I started coming across tweakers here and there who knew what they were doing. They said I was smoking it wrong and burning their shit. And...it was true.<br /><br /><br />----------PROPER SMOKING 101 BELOW----------<br /><br />Hear me out. If you&#039;re someone who smokes while holding a lighter inches away from the bowl, please leave the room lol. JK. But that is not how it&#039;s done. The shit WILL burn. Symptoms of burnt &#039;clears&#039;: Funny taste, turns brown or drastic discoloration and the bowl is still packed or the infamous pipe cracks when you finally do decide to cool it :&#039;( Neither of these scenarios have happened to me in years. Comes with experience.<br /><br />It&#039;s normal for shit to turn color but nothing crazy like dark brown/black. A tan color at best, that&#039;s fine, that&#039;s normal. If it&#039;s discoloring and bowl is still heavy, try my meth-od &lt;--see what I did there&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; Blue-flaming the bowl with a nice medium-sized adjustable flame and holding it directly at the the bottom of the bowl is best...heres why.<br /><br />Basically think of it like this, you wanna heat the the bowl at the same time as the meth. What I mean is, the temp of the bulb of the pipe where the meth is, and the actual meth itself is being heated at nearly the same rate. Where as holding the lighter inches away, is causing the glass to burn hot even before the meth starts to reach its point of combustion. An even distribution of heat is the goal, guys. Another thing:<br /><br />Most people don&#039;t cool their stuff in between hits, especially when sharing with others in rotation. ALWAYS COOL IN BETWEEN HITS. ALWAYS COOL so the meth doesn&#039;t burn. Although I am highly against the use of a bic, at the very least if you guys must use that, always cool the bulb after a puff or two. Then relight and smoke up again. Simple as that. THE MORE SHIT IN THE PIPE, THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS TO COOL. Because fuck, it&#039;d be a shame to see a gram turn to shit.<br /><br />If you use a torch especially, or let&#039;s say you&#039;re smoking with 4 others and its made one rotation or even two [god forbid], and no ones cooled it yet, it&#039;s not only being burnt, but if you try to cool it now, even with a damp rag, chances are the pipes gonna crack. SO WHAT I DO IS QUICKLY RUB IT AGAINST A PILLOW FOR 5-10 SECS TO ABSORB THE INITIAL HEAT B4 USING A DAMP RAG...or sponge or whatever you use.<br /><br />Try not to use paper towels or toilet paper, it&#039;s pointless, and has dust specks that make your pipe look ugly and when you&#039;ve been gacked out for awhile it&#039;s damn easy to mistaken it for shard dust lmao..<br /><br />The reason why I recommend against a bic, is because try blue-flaming a bic against the bulb of the pipe...that damn flame will reach up and engulf practically the entire sphere of the bulb! Because bics are made so the flame is extra thick, and that extra thickness guys, is too hot for your pipe/meth. ESPECIALLY WITH A THIN PIPE. One thing I will make correction on, is you can use bics but only on really thick pipes, but those are rare because when blown, the bulb thins out...and I&#039;m talking the thickness of a typical glass weed pipe that costs $20-30 at headshops. I&#039;ve only known one person with a METH pipe that thick. So thick you can only use a torch [or bic]. But most of us like myself have average meth pipes and they are thin at the bulb. Seriously guys, listen to my suggestions and try it. And, like I mentioned already, you DO NOT wanna be holding it inches away due to unevenly distributed heat.<br /><br />Give it a chance, try to envision it while reading what I&#039;ve mentioned and then execute it. Even with this info some may still need practice. Repition makes you good at/understand anything. Practice doesnt make perfect, PERFECT practice makes perfect. Make this tek a habit because I&#039;ve yet to burn my shit, when I do smoke this shit.<br /><br />-----------THE END----------<br /><br /><br />ON a side a note: another thing I&#039;d like to mention, is one way to tell if it&#039;s cut, is how it looks after recrystallization...at least &#039;round my area; if it looks like leopard spots, or square/window blocks, or + sign looking shit...chances are it&#039;s cut. to hell. Try observing your pipe against a light source. YOU WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE WINDMILLS, or pinwheels, diamond-looking-shapes-with-sunrays-expanding kinda shit because thats the good shit!<br /><br />Anyway smoke safe guys. Please try it b4 you bash it, and report back. Hopefully I&#039;ve saved some folks some money, some tastebuds, and some product. Because the shit lasts longer when it&#039;s smoked right&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />And Priscilla darlin, not tryna bash you in your own thread. I just believe it&#039;s being done wrong or you&#039;ve been smoking not too long. And as for your mentioning of the mechanics of the lighter breaking, this is why it&#039;s good to have 2+ lighters on hand. You wont even believe how bummed I am when I have all the gear, the pipe, the goods, but no lighter around but a fucking bic. I go to the store just to buy a pack of 3, and then I proceed to smoke. Bics are a complete last resort but I have used them out of &quot;desperation&quot; [more so laziness to go and buy] and eww it makes my stuff tastes like shit ..Seriously try my advice out, let me know how it goes. <br /><br />Thats it. Take care bebehhh&nbsp; :P

				Im a newb to all this just barely tried it before and from just seeing pics I always wondered about the hole in the methpipe if all the vapor wouldnt just fly out there.. but you are continously inhaling while vapor is rising from the puddle and sucking it up so very little escape out that little hole?<br />I used a lightbulb, it&#039;s basicly a round room and Ive used ducttape to tighten a hollow pen to it to suck from.. just heat it up and make it white of vapor inside before inhaling it all, like a normal pipe-hit then. This way I always wondered how much more I could take and wondered if I didn&#039;t do enough (no scale), I just made it white inside then inhale all of that..not continously inhaling as it seems is better? I read on Erowid that overdose symptoms are &quot;just&quot; headache, nausea etc.. is that all, so is it fairly safe to keep hitting more and more (atleast until headache,nausea etc. in worse case), OD is kinda rare/hard? cos I think I could smoke more as I never exhaled huge white clouds as in the vid/pic...<br />shoulda had some meth here today or past days from dubg/crystall wife that Im still waiting on,hopefully no customs trouble and Ill hopefully be able to try this all more soon=)&nbsp; <br />

You answered your own question there bud. Just reassuring you.<br /><br />One reason why it&#039;s best to get a REAL pipe and not use foil or lightbulbs is because you&#039;re also sucking in alot of excess air that dilutes the vapor, so your hit isn&#039;t @ it&#039;s full potential. To really benefit from smoking clears, you wanna fill your lungs with nothing but the goods. When I&#039;ve tried foil long ago due to having pipe, etc, I barely get the rush I&#039;m used to because of the reason I mentioned. Better off snorting or some other method. But smoking is fun, it&#039;s an art form to perfect. Kinda how rolling a blunt is for weed. That&#039;s half the fun! And the smoking part is like the soulmate to it.<br /><br />As for OD&#039;ing, I&#039;ve never OD&#039;d. But OD symptoms are you&#039;re gonna feel like you&#039;re dying..lol. Heart racing fast, dry heaving, panic kicks in, may feel like shit, etc. Especially if awake for awhile, and shadow people come 2 pay you a visit, that&#039;s never fun. But I love to dream/sleep so I always find a way to never stay up past 2-and a half, 3 days max. Some people can party for much longer, even a week, and I do not recommend that because of long term repercussions. Humans need sleep man.<br /><br />Hope that helps. Good luck on your future meth endeavors. ON a side note: Although my honest advice to you, especially if you&#039;re just starting out with this drug or something, is to make meth a secondary habit bro. I mean I smoke and shit, but I do not consider it my fave drug. I&#039;m actually ashamed of it, it&#039;s my guilty pleasure, and I don&#039;t go around in person parading THIS habit. Thats just my take, just sayin and shit. But yeah have fun, but be safe with this shit. Later<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I smoked speed and meth everyday for a lota years. I always use a bic lighter, blowtorches just end up ruining your glassware. Never clean your pipe using a blowtorch or stovetop burner it wrecks the glass, you will notice your meth doesn&#039;t roll around as nicely anymore if you heat the crap out of your glass. The absolute best way to clean you pipe is with a sponge made by Chux or 3M called magic sponge just break off a small amount of the white part of the sponge wet it lightly put it in your glassware and use a key or something to wipe it around in there. Once you use this sponge you will never use any other method it will easily wipe any fried stuff out of your pipe and makes it like new(clean your pipe regularly it really pays to).<br /><br />Another few little tricks are from your smokeware shop you can buy glass cones that fit into the top of your pipe, these means when you inhale you get less oxygen in and a much bigger hit of smoke, it also helps those people who try to inhale too quickly and get more air than smoke, the other good thing about these cones is that when you have finished your hit it doesn&#039;t let any smoke leave your pipe, no wastage that could be one more hit.(someone try this a let me know what you think)<br />Another good thing is if you have a plate with some wet paper towel on it after you finish your hit cool down your glassware on the wet paper towel it will make it all re-crystalize faster meaning again no loss, be careful don&#039;t cool your pipe down too quick on the wet towel as to crack it, this is more so probably for smokeable speed which doesn&#039;t re-crystallize as fast and keeps smokin.<br /><br />For all those people who think that meth will crystallize in your lungs there is no chance your lungs are moist it won&#039;t crystallize in a moist place<br />With the glass cone, you still put your meth in the pipe as usual then place the cone in, they drop in so the hang about half way down into the bulb area.<br />This thread is funny its like meth 101. Happy tweaking :o

				Meth mouth comes on within the first year ( if not already within first few months of using ) Cracked lips, cuts in your mouth from constant tongue movement, and teeth grinding. Its fucking painful when your sober and feel these things. For example, the dope i purchased is very clean, from what it seems, very little cuts to it. Doesn&#039;t really give me an urge to grind my teeth, but more flick my tongue inside my mouth rapidly back and forth for hours and hours on end. I developed a small cut at the tip of my tongue from doing this allllllllllllll day and night. An it fucking sucks. <br /><br />As for &quot; Meth face &quot; im not sure, i know alot of the sores appear if you binge, and pick your skin, but as for de-coloring of the skin.<br />Example: when i began my meth habit, i lived in hawaii. ( very beautiful place, great fuckin dope to! ) Im white, but had a good tan to my skin, after the first few months of using, my tan wasnt so...well...tan... my skin was getting pasty, and i was getting excessive amounts of acne everywhere from sweating, and staying up for 2 - 3 days at time, with no shower ( cause im fucking tweaking so hard the last thing im thinking of is cleaning myself thoroughly for an hour&nbsp; ) <br />The side effects of meth, do not out weigh the benefits you think it gives you. I&#039;ve seen meth ruin many lives, and even save one aswell ( crazy right?! ) <br /><br />

				&quot;Meth Mouth&quot; can be sought by taking supplement &lt;LYSINE&gt; before/ in between the binge, which relieve the severity of cold sore symptoms such as itching, burning and pain.&nbsp; It also reduces the number of outbreaks, and the healing time of cold sores.&nbsp; It includes vitamin C and zinc to assist with the healing of lesions.<br /><br />Most of meth users turned to &quot;Meth Face&quot; after a month time daily use.&nbsp; It mainly caused by dehydration and lost of appetite.&nbsp; Protein Powder with Full Cream Milk can maintain the energy you lost while tweaking.&nbsp; Electrolyte Tablets could avoided dehydration (at least you find yourself pee normally).<br /><br />These all just supplement ONLY, proper meal (3 meals a day) are still what your body needs!!!
