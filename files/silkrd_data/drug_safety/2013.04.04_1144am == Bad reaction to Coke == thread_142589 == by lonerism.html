				I took coke for the 2nd time ever.<br />Basically, within a minute I started feeling really nauseous, extremely tired to the point I couldn&#039;t keep eyes open and then I eventually threw up and stayed in bed rest of the day.<br />Tried it again and felt similar but not as nauseous but still very tired.<br /><br />The first time I tried Coke this didn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />Do you think it could be a bad reaction to levamisole?<br /><br />Can&#039;t think what else could have caused this..

				&nbsp;??? Sounds almost like you weren&#039;t putting coke into your body at all. Maybe some kind of sink cleaner? Someone may have gotten greedy and cut your bag all to hell with who knows what.

				4 or 5 years back we got ripped off by a dealer, 1 of our friends went to a house with this guy gave him the money and he offered him a line and said he was gonna get our coke from his stash.<br />My friend snorted it and was totally wasted, to wasted to even notice the guy took off with the cash.<br />We believe he was given heroin or coke cut with heroin, i had heard of this practice at that time. But it was at the prime of the afghanistan conflict and heroin flooded the local streets and was alot cheaper then cocaine.<br />I&#039;m not sure this is still the case, i doubt it, I also havent heard this happening basicly since then but your story immediatly reminded me of that night.<br />Just maybe... idk

Just check their other listings to see if they sell heroin/hydrocodone/morphine/oxycodone/fentanyl.<br /><br />If they do, there&#039;s quite a chance you&#039;ve been shipped one of these instead of the cocaine you&#039;ve paid for, which is extremely careless on their part, not to mention extremely dangerous!! I&#039;d be furious. Sure, mistakes happen, especially if it&#039;s a huge vendor dealing with hundreds of orders per week, but that&#039;s just not on.<br /><br />The best thing you can do is dispose of it safely (down the toilet) and never deal with that vendor again, as well as leave appropriate feedback to warn others. <br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend learning about the drugs you choose to dabble in because life is short and you should always care about what you put into your body!<br /><br />Stay safe

				what do you say to this disscusion it is obviously a vendor fuck up maybe he is too big and he ripped you off you should&#039;ve recieved all your money back or said his name so the public is aware of him and can watch out your not protecting him your hurting your fellow sr members but i can&#039;t say that your telling the truth everyone would know the difference between heroine and coke did your body feel any different

				one of the easiest tests to do with coke is put alittle on your finger and taste it it should have a numbing effect if not its either very bad or something else it sshouldn&#039;t taste like flour or vitamine b12 niacitol it sounds like you snorted a pill did it hurt when you sniffed it like a lot

Levamisole generally intensifies the coke euphoria, not make you vomit and tired.<br /><br />You could try the following test if you like -<br /><br />put a small amount onto a piece of foil and heat it up from underneath with a flame.<br />if it melts into a dark, waxy kind of blob and white smoke comes off it, it&#039;s probably heroin. It might also smell a bit like candy.<br /><br />A less definitive test would be just to smell the product, if it smells a bit like kerosene or solvents and if you put a tiny bit on your tongue and it causes numbing, it&#039;s probably cocaine. If it smells a bit like vinegar or more &quot;clinical&quot; like clean band-aids or vitamins and doesn&#039;t numb your tongue, it could be heroin.

				It would be so obvious whether it was coke or heroin just by looking at it, smelling it, and tasting.<br /><br />But it really does sound like you snorted heroin instead.&nbsp; You might not have felt good because you simply did too much and it just made you sick.&nbsp;
