				Ive been reading a lot of conflicting methods on how to store weed to keep fresh.<br />some say a freezer, some say fridge, some say glass jar, 3 seperate bags, prescription bottle...etc...<br /><br /><br />Can anyone give experiences? my friend got weed 1/8 I think but he smokes very little (1 or 2 hits before bed) so we need the best way to store &amp; stay fresh as long as possible. <br />Any good suggesstions?

				A mason jar will work just fine. Too many bags degrades the product since the movement of the plastic will knock off much of the trichome heads, and a prescription pill bottle isn&#039;t airtight. If your bud dries out though, it isn&#039;t really a bad thing, and I doubt an 8th will last you more than 1-2 months anyway. You&#039;ll be fine however you store it.

				I&#039;ve always used small mason jars.<br /><br />One particular example, I had an eighth of fairly potent weed that I used with a very efficient vaporizer so it ended up lasting some where around three months. To me the last bit seemed just as good as the first.

Just be careful that the pot isn&#039;t still damp or else it&#039;ll mold. Check every few days until you&#039;re sure it&#039;s dry. Plus it&#039;s great for curing.

Mason jars are cheap and easy to obtain; most grocery and hardware stores should stock them.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t put it in a fridge; if it does have any water content, it might destroy the THC. I&#039;m not certain if that&#039;s absolutely correct but I know it doesn&#039;t need to be refrigerated.

				agreed that you cant do any better than a mason jar. its def. the best as fas as preserving your buds, not knocking your thc off, and keeping the smell in. ive cured buds for over a year they keep like fine wine.

Freezing is good and can even improve the smoke.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Light is indeed the greatest factor in degradation of THC, followed by oxidation.&nbsp; Temperatures below &quot;room temperature&quot; (more accurately 20C, a slightly cool room) are mostly fine in the short term, though freezing doesn&#039;t hurt potency directly.&nbsp; However, it DOES make the trichome heads more brittle and easier to knock off (freezing is often an important hash-making step because of this), so cannabinoids could be lost in that way as well.&nbsp; For short term storage, your best bet is in a light- and air-tight container, the smaller the better (to limit oxidation), stored at room temperature.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the abstract from &quot;The stability of cannabis and its preparations on storage&quot; (Fairbairn, JW et al., 1976):<br /><br />&quot;Solutions of pure cannabinoids, nine samples of herbal and two of resin cannabis (one freshly prepared) were stored in varying conditions for up to 2 years. Exposure to light (not direct sunlight) was shown to be the greatest single factos in loss of cannabinoids especially in solutions, which should therefore be protected from light during analytical and phytochemical operations. Previous claims that solutions in ethanol were stable have not been substantiated. The effect of temperature, up to 20 degrees, was insignificant but air oxidation did lead to significant losses. These could be reduced if care was taken to minimize damage to the glands [trichomes] which act as &#039;well filled, well closed containers.&#039; Loss of tetrahydrocannabinol after exposure to light does not lead to an increase in cannabinol, but air oxidation in the dark does. It is concluded that carefully prepared herbal or resin cannabis or extracts are reasonably stable for 1 to 2 years if stored in the dark at room temperature.&quot;

				I learned a trick long ago to keep cookies moist and fresh you put in airtight container with a piece of fresh sliced bread and the cookies absorb moisture from bread and stay soft. it works really well so i put a piece in with weed and after 2 days it felt like the weed was exactly like the day it was recieved. The bread gets hard but it smelled really strong like the weed and i worried it may be taking something from weed but I know its a great cookie tip! Now the weed sits in fridge alone in container lol

				&quot;Curing only makes sense when cannabis has been mostly dried, but not yet cured, i.e. bud that is still technically damp&quot;<br /><br />Curing is done after your weed has dried. <br /><br />A good grower dries bud in a humidity controlled room for 2 weeks or until stem snaps then puts in jars and burps for a few more weeks, and then you can leave them in the jars for as long as you want and let the curing process continue.<br /><br />A good cure is 60 days.<br /><br /><br /><br />That is what I have learned from years of experience and reading from the best growers on icmag. <br /><br />If you want to add moisture back to bud use some WEED trimmings in a tea bag or coffee filter for a day or two in the jar, but not bread or orange peels. I guess it won&#039;t hurt the bud, but I am really finicky about my bud when I grow it, and would never add something like that that could change the taste even in the slightest. <br /><br />You could also leave it out in a room that is humid, but really I don&#039;t see the problem of weed being too dry..... It tastes better and burns better in my opinion, but to each his own. <br />
