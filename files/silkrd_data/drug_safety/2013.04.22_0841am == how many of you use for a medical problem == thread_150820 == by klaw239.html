				I order from here because its too hard/expensive for me to get a script for xanax that i need to fall asleep at nite. As for ritalin, my doc cut me off the ritalin and put me on some crap called straterra. Didnt do diddly squat for me, so now I&#039;m stuck ordering my ritalin from here.. Not bad prices here really compared to the legit pharmacy :)

				started to use heroin as my first drug due to psychological problems and didn;t want to be put on doctor&#039;s meds and dependant from a doctor. I feel whole from heroin and happy .. But I can&#039;t do it everyday and don&#039;t want to be addicted to it so&nbsp; have to treat myself with feel good once in a while.. I buy heroin off the streets, rarer drugs I can&#039;t get on here. How did opiates worsened your condition ? probably because they&#039;re expensive ?

				At first i started smoking weed cause it just of course made the world and everything better, then quit<br /><br />and about 16 started Oxicotton the original&#039;s by 21 i was full blown addicted to Oc&#039;s and dilaudids..Injecting and snorting.. <br /><br />Then during all this time my mom passed, so i used even more from 18 on up and started xanax and kpins for to just be able to cope with daily life and anxiety issues, as well as social ansxiety.. I use to never be like tht..<br /><br />, <br />Now in 07 i was shot in my ribb cage at point blank by a 38 hollow tip by some loser, and now i get meds but i go through them super fast..&nbsp; so now i use for medical reasons and cause i just like to get high..<br /><br />I funtion better whn im high.. Iv tried rehab and everything and it boils down to i dont like the feeling of being sober, i have to be on xanax or some type benzo and pain meds...it sucks really but i dug a deep hole and its gonna be a everlasting endeavor getting out. All addicts need to realize U WILL ALWAYS BE A ADDICT, Just the diffrence is if your active or in recovery.. <br /><br />But i notice most ppl who do the 12 steps and meeting thing, its like they become addicted to that, its still a crutch for being a addict, like us active user use drugs as a crutch for something..<br /><br />I cant do the whole meeting thing cause i dont like the religion brought into it.. Not everyone goes by the same thing And most all is Christain based and like me i would speak out my thoughts and bring valid points to history and the bible and the time line doesnt add up.. I just believe in something else so i dont get along good in meeting where they bring that into it..

				I use opiates, benzos, gabapentin and cannabis for chronic pain from a super serious injury a few years ago. sometimes i take my whole days worth at once to get high but only every once and while. Other wise i use all kinds of drugs to have different experiences, to change my perception and therefore my reality. I like to go to hyperspace and talk to the dmt beings, i like to nod out and have wonderful lucid dreams, i like to khole and play in lego land in my head. basically function specific arrangements of matter (drugs) fascinate my to a extreme degree. im a true pychonuate currently doing the soma shuffle. in conclusion i love drugs and all you guys so much have a wonderful drug filled life and dont let the piggys getcha!! hahahahaha&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D 8) :o ;) ::) :-[ :( :( :( :D :D

				I suppose quite a lot of people obtain substances on SR for medical rather than recreational uses. <br /><br />Just look at the selection of medicine on offer. Obviously there are the benzodiazepines that can be used to treat genuine issues as well as recreationally, but i&#039;ve seen things pass by that have no recreational value at all like medications for high cholesterol or blood pressure as well. <br /><br />I&#039;m not really sure if its the cost factor that drives this or physicians unwilling to prescribe medication, but in any case it goes far beyond people getting high. <br /><br />Personally i do order benzo&#039;s for anxiety sometimes - they seem to agree with me a lot better compared to the &#039;standard&#039; treatment with ssri&#039;s used in the netherlands. Here they are very reluctant to prescribe things like xanax because they are deemed addictive. I do not disagree that they can be, be considering the side effects of ssri&#039;s its not a hard choice to make.
