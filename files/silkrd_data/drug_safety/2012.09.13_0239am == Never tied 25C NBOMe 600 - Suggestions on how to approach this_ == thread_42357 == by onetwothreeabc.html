				So I&#039;ve never tried this before. From what I&#039;ve already researched, it&#039;s turning out to be a nice feeling. I just purchased &quot;25C NBOMe 600µg Complexed Tabs x5&quot; from the seller: HardHustle (Which I&#039;ve read good things about) I did read his suggestion on using it which was &quot;Apply behind the upper lip and above your two front teeth. Let it sit there on your upper gum for 30-40mins and either apply another or wait to get fucked up&quot;. My questions are, how long does each tab last? Can anyone relate what it feels like with a diff. drug? It is going to turn out that i&#039;d be doing all the tabs in one day? Thanks in advanced.

				lol, I understand your concern and appreciate it. the NBOMe was just to try it out which is why I got the lowest quantity available. MDMA is/was also newish to me, hence why I was asking questions about it to get informed. I consider myself a pretty responsible guy.

				I can&#039;t answer you&#039;re question on the 25c nbome, but I can tell you that mdma is neurotoxic (adjective Referring to substances or activities with an adverse effect on the nervous system, leading to ↑ excitability, numbness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, systemic failure or cardiac arrest). This is especially true in high doses or taking too often. I recommend at least a month in between doses but even doing it that frequent can make mdma lose its magic. Just be careful &amp; always research your substances BEFORE you consume.

				I got some of HH&#039;s 25c tabs. I took one my first time and would suggest the same for anyone trying it the first time. The come-up was pretty turbulent for me and quite uncomfortable the first time so I couldn&#039;t imagine what it would have been like if I took 2 the first time.<br /><br />You&#039;re always better off starting off with a lower dose and and re-dosing as you feel fit, although I haven&#039;t re-dosed 25c yet. You can always try taking more tabs in the future if you want a stronger trip next time.<br /><br />The trip lasted about 5 hours before I felt mostly normal, but I had a hard time sleeping for a few hours after that.
