				How could I forget, chew ice! Just get a big cup. At venues when I go on LSD I ask the people selling drinks for a big cup of ice. Sometimes I get a strange look but they always give it to me lol

				I know that many users of MDMA supplement with magnesium in an attempt to alleviate bruxism.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how much evidence supports this, and I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but many claim it works wonders; the guy who runs TheDEA.org points out that it makes some sense because &quot;Mg++ ions are involved in controlling nerve firing.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps a muscle relaxer would be effective?&nbsp; Take that suggestion with a grain of salt and do your research first, because I haven&#039;t.&nbsp; A cursory Google turns up this thread (clearnet!): shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/14191015.&nbsp; In it, someone provided the following information:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: BothHands</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Vasoconstriction is one of the causes, but more likely it&#039;s regular muscle tension.&nbsp; The 5-HT2A receptors are directly responsible for muscle tension.&nbsp; In fact, most muscle relaxers work by antagonizing this receptor.&nbsp; As a psychedelic, LSD is an agonist.&nbsp; It causes the opposite of muscle relaxation.&nbsp; I find that if I keep myself distracted, I don&#039;t really notice it.&nbsp; But I get it on all psychedelics.&nbsp; Ever wonder why it feel so good to stretch when you&#039;re tripping?&nbsp; Stretching releases Nitric Oxide which is a powerful muscle relaxer.&nbsp; Taking some vitamin pills for a few days before your trip should also help.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I get it every time, I have never caught myself grinding my teeth but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I do, but when the trip gets intense I bite down as hard as I possibly can. Drives me nuts as well, hurts my jaw just thinking about.<br /><br />I always smoke a bowl after I peak, it generally induces another wave but I still clamp my jaw down. I haven&#039;t really tried many things to help it, but I find if I lay down on my side, ie on the couch looking at the TV, then it goes away.

Get moving— do some running and you&#039;ll run better than you&#039;ve ever run. Or do some meditation, or something sexual or artistic. Get a massage. The tension will stop bothering you.
