				Ketamine&#039;s great. I&#039;ve spoken to aliens and had bizarre out of body experiences. I haven&#039;t done it for about ten years now though. I was taking it most days by the end, and then just one day decided (whilst on it) that I didn&#039;t need to do it any more. So I didn&#039;t.<br /><br />It&#039;s 100% my favourite drug, no contest.<br /><br />Have you done it before? I always snorted it - I&#039;ve no experience of &#039;parachuting&#039; I&#039;m afraid. 200mg up the nose would get you pretty far gone. I don&#039;t remember doing many doses of above a quarter gram (250mg) in the whole time I was on it I don&#039;t think. And that was enough to meet the aliens and so on. You&#039;ll need a sitter though really. Things can get quite confusing and I wouldn&#039;t recommend trying to move around on it until you&#039;re a bit more experienced with it.

				Good Luck Mito,<br />K was not my idea of a good time. I do not EVER want to be in that hole again. Nausea, weird depth perception/distortion, felt zombie like, oh yeah did i mention nausea? projectile vomiting for a bit, feeling as if prepped for surgery, laying in the same position for several hours, out of body shit, and slight nausea or moderate to severe nausea could be expected. and do not try to be mobile, it can be tough. when at events i can tell who the poor souls down in that hole are. ketamine is not a psychedelic, it is a dissociative used for surgical purposes. to each his own, and i wish you the best, since your getting a g might be best to have a friend over, a spotter of sorts

				&nbsp;:) One thing I will say is Ketamine is an extremely habit forming drug. Quite morish actually. I think some people love it and others cant stand it. For me I love the feeling it can give. But it&#039;s best used occasionally as your tolerance will build quick..very quick. A few bumps used to get me riding the horse but now it can take a gram. <br /><br />K holes can be really enlightening or pretty scary, i think it depends on the mood and the stuff you have got.<br />Its hard to describe but in small doses things can look really good especially in the snow!! its a bit magical. I recommend snorting a few small lines first off and then build gradually. It can be quite shit scary when you take too much you end up in a fucked up state and wonder if youll get bak! Lay down with some chilled out music and just go with it.. dupstep works a treat... <br />It is a much better relaxing experience when injected into a muscle but only if you know your stuff and practise this safely.. with small bumps mixed with clean water and heated slightly on a spoon....<br />If anyone has any queries just post here... i have a lot of experience with this drug.<br /><br />Also if anyone can recommend any really good quality K here that would also be great...<br /><br />Hope this helped<br />Silkyyyy

				@Mito...<br />I wouldnt recommend swallowing your ket for a few reasons.<br />1. it tastes gross<br />2. its very bad for your insides and bladder<br />3. When its taken orally it turns to norketamine which gives a more sleepy anasthetic effect..<br /><br />Cook the crystals in a pan on a low heat mixed with some water until it turns to powder (careful not to burn) scrape it out and sniff in bumps to get you started...<br />Or add water to the crystals and leave on a plate over nite and let it dry out...<br />

				^^^ Thank you man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I just crush the crystals, the same way I&#039;d do with coke, and snort them?<br /><br />I&#039;m not really into cooking stuff, but I do have experience with snorting.

				Yeah, that is an option.<br />I have done this before.. what I did find was its harsher on your nostrils and the drip is not very pleasing.<br />Also its harder for the crystals to get absorbed so it takes longer for the feeling to kick in, so be careful to wait it out before u sniff again. This is just how its been for me.. might be different for others...#<br /><br />How big are the crystals? appearance?<br />

				Like I said... start of small. My first line was about an inch long and I was happily fucked for about an hour...then i got too big for my boots trying to do more and ending up in freaked out zombie mode. Once mastered now I usually know how much.. A good k hole is so fun tho... but small bumps on the dance floor are great! <br /><br />Ketamine.<br />Regretamine<br />Sketamine<br /><br />Research it..well worth it<br /><br />Just cant think of anything worse than swallowing it..<br />

				I had my first &#039;K-hole&#039; a few days ago on Freedompeople&#039;s ketamine. Snorted about 200mg over the course of about an hour, lay in bed with all the lights off with my mp3 player in :) It was a very strong, introspective experience. Very unique, I&#039;d highly recommend it

				Dear friends,<br /><br />Yesterday night I had one of the most profound, fantastic and wonderful experiences of my life.<br /><br />I believe I reached what is known as the K hole.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I started snorting around 7:30pm, slowly some 50mg each time, but steadily.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The effects began immediately, but they weren&#039;t strong.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve noticed during my second journey with K (Firday being my first) I think the effects of K peak for a few minutes, then start to fade away.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can feel your limbs go numb, then come back.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That&#039;s when I would snort another line.&nbsp; &nbsp; Though the effects do fade away, you always feel like you are sedated, tired.<br /><br />Not for a second did I ever feel anxiety or had any mind fucking thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much to the very contrary, calmness and serenity were the norm.<br /><br />At around 10pm I think I had reached a K hole, because I closed my eyes I began to see these wonderful geometric patterns, as if I were inside a matrix or cube.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a wonderful feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had this extreme sensation of lightness, something I just can&#039;t describe, but I am sure I have never experienced before in my life.<br /><br />I tried to listen to some music, but it appears that K kills it, because the sounds and rhythms were a bit slow, broken, weird, almost unintelligible.&nbsp; &nbsp;I simply couldn&#039;t enjoy any music.&nbsp; But that wasn&#039;t a problem.<br /><br />I had some serious and deep insights about by existence, it was very interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, things I cannot describe because they are too personal, but it really touched me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then the effects began to fade away slowly, it was around 10pm.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I asked my self if I should call it a day or do a bit more.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided for the latter, this stuff was too good.<br /><br />And there I go snort this time a generous line of K:&nbsp; I entered the K hole nicely and swiftly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More of those colorful geometric patterns appeared before my closed eyes, a buzz in my head, I was inside a spinning cube, many thoughts, for a moment I believed I was some one else, it was really strange.<br /><br />Suddenly I realized that I couldn&#039;t focus anymore, and had this concern if I would ever snap out of it state of bliss.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was profound, I felt a level of consciousness I have never felt before.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Last night&#039;s voyage will leave a profound mark in me, a positive one for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So I went to bed around midnight, tired and with a heavy head, but feeling calm and very good.<br /><br />I have what I believe is some 200mg left of K (I wish I had a scale).<br /><br />Now comes an important question:&nbsp; &nbsp;how bad is K for your health?<br /><br />I won&#039;t repeat this next weekend because I already have some cyanescens mushrooms and 25c that I&#039;d like to try out, but after what happened last night, I might feel tempted to repeat....&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				About 10 years ago, a friend and I went to Mexico to get some various goods. This was before the crackdown over there, when almost anything was openly available in the farmacias (still is to an extent, you just have to hunt, and they keep it in the back). Anyway, I bought a few vials of K (1 gm each, $10. Those were the days...) and came back, extracting it. Small does were fun, but it wasn&#039;t until I snorted a really large dose that its magical aspect was revealed to me. It was around 200mg, maybe&nbsp; a bit more, split between both nostrils. I was alone in my room, in the dark, and laid down on my bed. It began coming on with a sort of &quot;static&quot; or white noise sound, and then I felt the whole room turn backwards and I began falling. I swear, it was identical to the sensation of freefall. All of a sudden I was in this massive room, a huge hall that stretched on infinitely in either direction, with an upper tier/ railing, and this big marble fountain in the middle. Everything was this rose and beige checkerboard marble... it was unreal, but so, so clear.&nbsp; After a moment I was back on my bed, and then the cycle started over again. It repeated for a bit, and then I came back to reality permanently after maybe 40 minutes. Terrific experience.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve given small amounts to people who absolutely hated it, saying it was like a personal hell for an hour. Really subjective stuff, depends a lot on where you take it and what sort of person you are. Be prepared to lose control of yourself; I think its that aspect some folks don&#039;t like.

				Yesterday I had a few lines of K, perhaps around 100mg.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I laid back in the couch, comfy and started watching a concert by Hugh Laurie in New Orleans (amazing stuff).<br /><br />The effects kicked in after a few minutes when the band was playing some awesome blues.<br /><br />Wow what a trip.<br /><br />After that I entered the K-hole.<br /><br />It&#039;s amazing, I have this feeling that I can&#039;t get out of it, but I&#039;m in control of my thoughts, which abound. <br />It freaks me out in a fantastic way.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It appears I am outside my mind and body, I&#039;m somewhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s incredible.<br />Lots of fractals when I close my eyes.<br /><br />I find it interesting that K somehow &quot;breaks&quot; the music, makes it slower and fragmented.&nbsp; It&#039;s weird.<br /><br />This is definitely the best substance I have tried in my whole life.&nbsp; Better than LSD, weed, etc.<br /><br />It comes with a price though:<br /><br />1) heavy body load, after exiting the K hole I feel like a zombie, sedated.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I went to bed, slept very well, had nice dreams and woke up feeling awesome.<br />2) nasal cavity, same problem with anything you snort. The next day your nose is congested.<br />3) my main concern: there are several reports of Ketamine damaging the bladder after prolonged use, as the substance corrodes the bladder walls internally;<br /><br />Guys, how are your bladders?&nbsp; &nbsp; :P

				First of all Silkyyyy your advice on this thread is very very accurate and good and I would like to reiterate what most people on here have been saying by stating that you have to have the right mindset to enjoy this. It is very subjective, but being one of those people my many years of experience of this drug are awesome.<br /><br />mito - it has been absolutely great reading your accounts of your first time. I have introduced a fair few of my friends into this drug.<br /><br />Since having a little one I only do these things around once every 3-6 months or so and crave it somewhat a lot.<br /><br />Now on to my experiences and advice:<br /><br />This drug is not a social drug<br />This is not for everyone<br /><br />Never start with a massive amount (if its your first few times), I have never seen anybody who has done this enjoy it and I have seen a lot of newcomers to this special, special dug. So dripfeed the mind, start with 10mg upward just like mito has....<br /><br />A successful way I have found is to all sit down, talk your friends through nice things (a bit like them terrible mood tapes you got in the 80&#039;s/90&#039;s) while they are having small doses - helps them relax and get used to the unusual feeling of disassociation to the senses.<br /><br />Music (Trippy techno, minimal, tech-house, progressive house are my weapons of choice) can be a great addition to your experience, if you are on your own then headphones and eyes closed can take you some awesome places.<br /><br />An awesome experience me and my friends discovered was that getting in a really comfy seat, beanbag etc and turning the lights off and then putting on an animated movie like Over The Hedge and doing some rather large lines (200mg as a guess) would immerse you in the screen and make you feel like your in the movie. We coined it Ket Movie Nights.<br /><br />Now for the not so great experiences I have noticed:<br /><br />Take too much and you forget what happened which can be disappointing.<br />Not great in a club as too easy to take too much (good though in v small amounts!)<br />It feels like your standing pissing forever during a session.<br />Nose feels like crap.<br />DISGUSTING taste, especially when it drips down the back of your throat after snorting.<br />Feel a bit spacy a few hours after - from my experience do not play 5 a side footie in goals after a sesh as it is pretty amusing how bad you will be :p&nbsp; ::)<br />Don&#039;t eat it, we tried to bomb it once, you need at least 500mg to feel anything, the onset is slow and the experience is so mild and not like the things we look for when snorting.<br />My friends have all worried about bladder problems and we can&#039;t say whether prolonged excessive use will damage your bladder but I get a feeling that it&#039;s not far off being right!<br />Beware - there is a shortage in the UK at the moment so people are fobbing off all sorts of stuff as K, don&#039;t just assume it&#039;s K if they say it is!<br /><br />I have had lots of LSD, 2C-B and K and can honestly say K has given me the best out of this planet trips of my life. LSD was awesome but nothing too trippy more of an extreme mood enhancer for me.<br /><br />Silkyyyy - I am very interested to find out more about injecting it, all I think of when saying that is heroin and stuff and makes me feel like it is something dark and nasty (as you can tell I never want to try heroin).<br /><br />I know intramuscular injections would be faster and I guess, cleaner it&#039;s just taking that step and feeling safe knowing someone who has done it before can give some good guidance&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Hope that helps people - I have never shared anything like that before outside my circle of friends. I am new here and like the look of these forums.<br /><br />Speak soon,<br /><br />RixAbiX<br />

				I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m starting to build up tolerance.&nbsp; &nbsp; I did a few lines of Ketamine last weekend and the effects were quite ephemeral.&nbsp; &nbsp;I reached the K-hole but was kicked out after a few minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m still doing small lines, never exceeding 200mg total, perhaps even less.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to bump it up.<br /><br />It&#039;s the fourth time I&#039;ve done K over the past 4 weeks, always during weekends.<br /><br />I see a lot of reports of people doing 1g on a single line...&nbsp; &nbsp;Damn...

				Watch out for that tolerance Mito. It catches up on you quick. By the way im silkywonk but with a new name as I forgot my password- damnn!<br /><br />I have used K for 3 years and now and I need more or less a gram to get fucked and it sometimes sends me scatty and a bit schizo so just be careful. I should have respected this drug more but got too greedy. STILL love it though just be careful.<br /><br />As for IM. The way I did it was like this:<br />Use a filter an insulin type needle 27 or 29 size, wipe top of thigh where its muscley with an alcohol wipe. Use sterile water on a spoon and then put in a nice little bump of K. Heat it with lighter to make sure the powder dissolves properly. Then IMPORTANT.&nbsp; suck up liquid and use asap so it doesnt solidify again. suck it up SLOWLY and when all in hold it up and flick it to get the bubbles out. The find a muscley bit of thigh and push in with the needle perfectly straight and not bent. avoid veins,,,, then slowly plunge in and wait for the beautifullllllll feeeeeeelingggggg

				My first time doing K was when I had one of the best ecstasy pills of my life. Contained heroin, ketamine, and good &#039;ol MDMA. Purple nike is what was. I had a test kit and it tested positive for all of the above so I know for a fact what I was dealing with.<br /><br /><br />I didn&#039;t really k&#039;hole it that bad. Probably just because of the other drug&#039;s properties.<br /><br /><br />Now, the second time I did K was right before I went to a rave. Best mistake. I k&#039;holed REALLY hard. My eyes were locked on the stage lights, feeling as if I was being drawn in. The sound was pleasantly distorted.<br /><br /><br />Good times. Good times.

				In the UK it is a VERY popular party drug but there seems to be a drought at the moment which has its good and bad sides, there are some serious ket fiends out there both funny and a bit sad. But its a very fun drug :) would not recommend eating it though? Sniff it all day long :)

				Last week I had another few fat lines of Larghetto&#039;s K.<br /><br />At first I thought his K wasn&#039;t doing much, first I though it was maybe the quality, but then I also realized I was building up tolerance.&nbsp; The effects were going away pretty fast, almost after a few minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would enter a K hole and leave it soon after.<br /><br />That&#039;s when I decide to bump it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I snorted those fat lines (maybe more than 200mg), and began watching this movie called Immortals.<br /><br />Wow, I entered the K hole pretty fast and thought I was in a dream.&nbsp; &nbsp;The movie characters, the scenes, I thought the actors were talking to me and would soon join me in my couch.&nbsp; It was amazing, scary and fun at the same time.&nbsp; The movies becomes some sort of interactive story.<br /><br />The problem is that the next day my nose was in a miserable state, swollen and with a brutal nasal congestion.&nbsp; &nbsp;And also K is starting to disgust me, the taste is terrible.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I was at a music festival, and some dude named John from Ohio (learned about him through our &#039;ketamine talk&#039;) stopped by and we chilled at our tent for a good 2 hours snorting bumps of K off a key. I was also tripping on some doses which made the time very very intense and didnt know where I was most of the time which felt awesome to me. The outside of my body felt very numb. I stood up a few times and walked around which was nuts bcuz I didnt have a care in the world for what I was doing. It was thee best time ive had. everything seemed to be in slow motion. and music sounded amaazzing. I have experimented with alot of drugs. and Ketamine is my favorite hands down.<br /><br />I recommend this drug to anyone and everyone. sorry if my story wasnt that detailed.

				Well Its an intense trip on LSD combined with an intense trip on K. I felt very slurry (kinda drunk like) but different. combined with slow moving visuals. as things expanded and got smaller. you feel very drugged up and very very relaxed. sorry if thats a shitty explanation :/ but I tried lol

				My favourite thing to do is &quot;K-Racing&quot;, it&#039;s a lot of fun and can be compared to a cross between Royal Ascot and Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />Here are the rules. <br /><br />All participant racers must measure 100mg of Ketamine that must be the same size/length/width (give or take, you don&#039;t have to be a tit about it)<br /><br />All participant racers must snort said line of K at the same time. All lines must be finished.<br /><br />All participant racers must then try and make their way from the place the line is snorted in the home to the cash till, withdraw funds for night out and then buy their ciggies from the shop and then make their way back to the front door. <br /><br />The last one to start walking like they are on the moon wins. <br /><br />When my mates and me have played this nobody has ever made it back to the front door before. I have fell over shop displays quite a few times.

				I personally never enjoyed the ketamine feeling. It makes me anxious and all &quot;weirdy&quot;. Negative emotions sparkle that are disastrous in combination with the immobility and other effects. However, I do enjoy MXE. The base of the feeling is the same as ketamine, but it has an additional &quot;fun aspect&quot; that I really enjoy.<br />I remember being out with friends one night, drinking a few beers and every half an hour I went to the restroom to snort a bump of MXE. By the end of the night, I was borderline fucked up, laughing at myself, walking straight was completely impossible and I had these strange thought patterns about being present in another dimension :D Additionally, I dont feel any nausea with MXE, whereas ketamine gives me a bad case of nausea.

				Hey mito,<br /><br />Great you have been having the positive experience you have been. Ketamine is a rare and blessed substance.<br /><br />If you want to get to best from it I suggest quit sorting it and start taking it IM. You can use a U-100 microfine insulin syringe with a needle as thin as a hair and a mere 15mm long - in the shoulder muscle it&#039;s simple and easy. IM has a much better energy in the body and you will find the experience much smoother.<br /><br />Dosage, if you want to explore properly (which I sense you do), should be in the 100mg to 300mg range. John Lilly has explored up to the 400-500mg range, but the max I have done is 300mg and I felt I was at the outer limit of what K had to offer there. Most of my trips were at the 100mg - 150mg range, which was adequate.<br /><br />Shoot it, lie down in a dimly lit room with soft music or silence, close your eyes and let it take you (Brian Eno&#039;s Apollo is quintessential K music!). Make sure you are warm (a light blanket over you is good). Once you come out, STAY DOWN for at least an hour to allow your etheric body to re-integrate with your physical body. A sitter is good.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only done racemic Ketamine personally, but from what I hear the S isomer is more interesting than both the R and racemic mix.<br /><br />Treat K with great respect. It will bite you if you do not. It is a very deep psychedelic and it will bend reality around you. Keep it to a max of once a week - preferably 1-2 times per month. If you are casual with it you can get addicted through sheer fascination. It tends to trap the more intellectually inclined and intelligent explorers because the depth of knowledge revealed is so seductive. Be aware of this and you will be fine.<br /><br />As you will have probably noticed so far, there is total ego dissolution above 100mg IM (perhaps 150mg - 200mg insufflated). If you want to crystallize some measure of identity out in the K space and be a more volitional explorer as it were, then you can use 2C-B for this purpose (normally 10-20mg). The time I did 300mg K was with 30mg 2C-B, and was a very heavy trip - but worth it! (Take the 2C-B an hour to 90 minutes before the K.)<br /><br />Continue to treat it with respect and it will reward you with the deepest insights that psychedelics have to offer. But know this: K is not the way anywhere. It is a closed-loop Mobius and does not lead to transcendence (though it may help catalyze it).<br /><br />BG<br />

IM k is a great experience (i only IM when i have vials), and if you already have some tolerance from snorting IM&#039;ing seems to be the only way to get the full effects of ketamine. though i never iv&#039;d it.. for me it seems like tolerance goes up even if you doing k once a moth- but thats just my experience..<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve only done racemic Ketamine personally, but from what I hear the S isomer is more interesting than both the R and racemic mix.&quot; i am experienced with both, s-isomere and racemic, and i still prefer the racemic stuff! back in the days i only got racemic-powder dried from vials, very fresh, and that was the best k i ever came across, just my opinion. now most vendors offer the s-isomere, i think its because of the hype that its more active than racemic. but when i take k, i want to hole and pass out but thats almost impossible for me with s-isomere. also s-isomere keeps me awake for some thime while on racemic i can pass out and sleep for hours. <br /><br />&quot;The time I did 300mg K was with 30mg 2C-B, and was a very heavy trip - but worth it!&quot; i experienced the same, it seems like k enhance the visual effects from 2cb a lot, the same happens when you do k with acid or even mdma - that are all great combos worth to try!<br />

				I love to take K and then start doing research on the internet. <br />I take quite some dose, but then the research is amazing... it&#039;s like I&#039;m leaving my body and just &quot;flying around on the net&quot;. <br />I found amazing thing&#039;s on the net while searching on K. <br />The &quot;weird&quot; thing is that I can still type on the keyboard - even if I don&#039;t feel my body anymore... <br />Great stuff, but I get bored of it quite quickly (max 3 days in a row then I&#039;m not even in the mood to do it anymore). <br /><br />

				Me &amp; she had a magical time on Saturday night... Doses are per person, and are what we generally assume to be light/borderline for both of us.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t want anything too heavy, and needed to have a test-drive on some 5-APB which had just arrived.<br /><br />DO NOT SNORT THAT SHIT. EVER. It&#039;s like cinnamon powder, flavored with toilet-cleaner.<br /><br />So T+0, 50mg 5-APB, parachuted.<br /><br />Took about 90 mins to feel a nice, buzzy glow. Would&#039;ve helped to dance a bit, bit restless in a domestic setting.<br /><br />So, T+2h, 50 mg MXE. Smoothed things out beautifully, now feel like on a really good non-mongy MDMA roll.<br /><br />OK, we&#039;d like some visuals now please...<br /><br />T+3h, 15mg 2C-B, insufflated. For me, that is barely there, got some light patterning and a nice feeling. My gf got a much more intense reaction (as I expected) and she was out cooing over the starry sky, playing with stuff, sighing, and dancing at the beauty of it all! This is significant, because until recently she was generally quite nervous around psychedelics, and often got quite weepy in full-on trips.<br /><br />Now, let&#039;s take a leaf out of D.M Turner&#039;s book, and blend in some K!<br /><br />T+4h, 180 mg K (Reich, insufflated). Again, below my holing dose which is usually closer to 250mg.<br /><br />Lay down on a couch each, visualizer on the big screen, some deep dubby techno going on...<br /><br />Fucking hell! Absolutely stunning. Far more, and far different from, either 15mg of 2C-B or 180mg of K. A whole new category of experience.<br /><br />No hole as such, no anaesthesia, and eyes wide open, but happy to lie on the couch. Talk about feeling the music?! The visualizer seemed to be chucking stuff out into mid-air, in front of us, the pulsing of the music and the shapes seemed to be everywhere, including deep within our bodies. At one point I cried out something like &quot;It feels like I&#039;m being fucked by the music, hanging in mid-air!&quot;<br /><br />Really intense &quot;confusion&quot; of things seen and things felt, orgasmically pleasurable, and very difficult to describe properly. Lasted for at least an hour, and we were both insanely happy throughout.<br /><br />Stayed up a few hours more just trying to find the words, and necking a few bongs to push us towards bed.<br /><br />I can&#039;t begin to imagine how intense this might be with &quot;proper&quot; doses of each, but plan to find out fairly soon.<br /><br />A+++++

				how does a K-hole compare to, say, a DMT trip?<br />I hear they&#039;re both out of body experiences. from what I&#039;ve read, DMT is a much stronger trip.<br />But I was wondering if someone could give a detailed comparison of both. :)

				Only you can give yourself a detailed comparison of both. I can see how they might sound similar, but really, they are night &amp; day.<br /><br />The only thing they have in common is they both frighten a lot of people, esp at higher doses.<br /><br />K is easier to administer, it&#039;s usually just a line or two for beginners. DMT has to be vaped (not burned!) and tastes quite strange and makes most people gag the first few times, so it can be difficult to get anything from it, let alone a full on trip.<br /><br />The great DM Turner (see thread in Philosophy forum) used both extensively. He said that the entities he encountered in deep DMT space warned him specifically that ketamine was a &quot;Frankenstein molecule&quot; and should not be trusted, as it did not obey the &quot;rules&quot; of hyperspace. Much as he liked ketamine, he came to refer to it as &quot;psychedelic heroin&quot;.<br /><br />Our own &quot;Blue Giraffe&quot; summed it up perfectly when he said that the revelations of K are a &quot;Moebius strip&quot;, beautiful to look at, but they don&#039;t lead anywhere...<br /><br />Myself, I appreciate them both and use them occasionally, having worked up carefully from tiny doses.

				Long time ago in highschool me and my boyfriend at the time tried it during a movie. It was messed, thought the world was ending, felt so messed up. <br /><br />Seats were like spinning too, crazy. Then I became addicted to it and didn&#039;t quit until my last year of University. Personally for people who can&#039;t control (ie Me)<br />this is a terrible drug. I would pee blood and I would get cramps that made my PMS feel like a tummy massage. I remember sitting in bed holding my stomach <br />unable to go to school. <br /><br />Now I just stick to the herb every once in a while.
