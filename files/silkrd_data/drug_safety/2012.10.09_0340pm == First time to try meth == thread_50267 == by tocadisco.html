				i used to abuse my adderall script 2 years ago for one year straight, and various other RC stimulants.<br />smoked, oral, and intranasal<br /><br />question:<br /><br />i am thinking about both snorting and smoking.<br /><br />smoking for a quick fix that could last me 4 strong hours(?)<br />and snorting for slightly longer, when im not working, and can be functional.<br /><br />what do you guys think, will .5g last me a long time, if i only dose ONCE/TWICE a day?<br />or should i just buy the gram?<br /><br />i don&#039;t have time for abuse, and moderation is the key that i learned in the high points in my life

				I can&#039;t fathom why you would try meth when you admit that you abused Adderall in the past. Meth is much, much stronger. What starts out as &quot;just one hit a day&quot; will most likely turn into tweaking for a few days straight, and then wanting more. If I were you, I&#039;d go to someone I trust and who is cool with my drug use and give them the bag, promising not to let me take more than 10-20mg a day.<br /><br />In any case, snort it if you&#039;re looking for a kick but not to get high as fuck.

				I can&#039;t honestly say it &quot;sounds good,&quot; then, no. To start using one of, if not THE most powerful drug in your favorite class of drugs, one that you&#039;ve &quot;desired ever since...&quot; and after you&#039;ve been sober for a year and a half... it sounds like a relapse waiting to happen. Luckily you won&#039;t be in a position to get a lot more.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know you, though, so I can&#039;t really fully judge the situation. Maybe you have a total handle on your drug use and cravings. <br /><br />I can say from experience though, just because you have a limited quantity of a substance won&#039;t make you not use it. Whatever choice you make, I wish you the best of luck.

				I&#039;ve tried heroin, and a hand full of other &quot;Hard Drugs,&quot; but I really do not know why in gods name someone would want to use Methamphetamine. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried it though so I can&#039;t say much, nor am I bashing it. It just seems a bit pointless.<br /><br />&nbsp;After all it is pretty much the same as Amphetamine Salts, which I think, and have heard from plenty of others that they prefer, and like Amphetamine Salts more than Methamphetamine.

				smoking meth is fun....it&#039;s very easy to go thru a gram in a day...just blowing fat clouds...that cotton candy aftertaste you get as you exhale...then the ninjas (shadow people) show up....then it&#039;s not so fun anymore...

				Start with a very small dose orally if at all. I&#039;ve seen people loose everything they have to meth. Everyone acts like Heroin is this evil drug but it doesn&#039;t compare to meth. I know 2 heavy heroin users that choose meth over heroin. Don&#039;t know any meth users who have switched to Heroin. The problem is you do a little to much and then find it being 6am and wide awake. By need and not choice you talk your self into doing a little more to make it through the day. This turns into your daily routine and next thing you know your up days and days and days. If you liked adderall you will love meth and before you know it meth will be the only thing you love.

MDPV was about as fiendish as it got for me (smoking) . Also another thing that will work out for me is that, when the meth arrives to me in the US, i have work 6 out of 7 days a week. impossible for me to smoke at night, only to start a day off ONCE.<br /><br />if you don&#039;t abuse meth, no problems right? <br />i work out five days a week ( heavy lifting) , and have beautiful girlfriends that i care about a lot. <br />i see meth as an appetite suppresant, and euphoria IMO

				IMHO you shouldn&#039;t touch or even be considering touching meth if adderall had such an abhorrent hold over your life.&nbsp; <br />You may as well swallow a thermonuclear weapon and call it a day with the aftermath of destruction doing meth will do to someone so easily taken a hold of.

				^ You see this? Stop planning out your dose schedule, just don&#039;t fuckin do it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been addicted to xanax and thats a bitch, but that&#039;s the only seriously addictive drug you listed. I am prescribed Vyvanse every day, have been prescribed addie for 5 years, I smoke weed most days, every day for 3-5 years or so. I drink most days, What the fuck are RCs??? I&#039;ve done piles of shrooms, plenty acid, plenty MDMA, MDA, plenty coke when partying (never developed a habit due to anxiety) and a bunch of painkillers for 3 surgeries 30 shoulder dislocations which im still recovering from. I understand that your rehab stay way necessary for your own life circumstance, but don&#039;t underestimate Meth man, I&#039;ve never done it and never will. If you were even slightly addicted to Adderall than Meth is gonna fuck your world up, cause I have an addictive personality and find Rx amphetamines to be very non-addictive.

				I have known a few people with ADHD who took to meth. The tweak makes them good maids and students but in the end 1 hit a day turns into 5 or 6 with anything. RC&#039;s, some very amazing and others nasty, are not for the faint of heart. It all depends of what you know and whats the real truth.<br /><br />I for one dont care if you do meth or smack but with meth its always best to give the bag to someone. 1 hit a day and out of sight out of mind but your giving amazing power into someones hands. <br /><br />If you had a issue with you medication you will have a issue with this and thats just fact but i say go for it if you think you know what your doing and are ready to accept a devil into your life.

You really do get more from a pipe, as well as an eaiser way to distrubute heat evenly. Straight to black and your flame technique is whack. The only way i could immagine one person using a gram in a day is they had bad technique, bad quality meth(I mean horriable junk for you to use a gram.) , or an extremely high tolerance.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only known of one person that legitmatly used a gram a day. (They used IV.) But, they had been using for 16 years daily.

				A gram a day, fuck.<br /><br />May as well say bye bye to a&nbsp; vast quantity of dopiminergic neurons in your brain.<br /><br />Fuck, doing it for fun is great (well not for me, methamphetamine is the most disgusting drug that I know of, except perhaps MDPV ... except for the constant constant use of meth that the drug induces vs. the ... hopefully not constant use of MDPV.)&nbsp; &nbsp;No judgemment meant though if meth is your drug of choice then that&#039;s your business and none of my business :), but bragging that you smoke a gram a day is just retarted and a true reflection of just how many brain cell&#039;s you&#039;ve seriously fucked up in your brain.

				This sounds like a bad idea to me. Just like others have said, if you have had issues with substances like adderal, etc. then meth is not going to be your friend. All the best either way, but you&#039;re likely to be better off without.

				Saying drugs will never take hold of you again is just plain ignorant. You think you beat your addiction with rehab? You would NOT be buying METHAMPHETAMINE THEN. A drug that the main effect is a lack of self control, and you think you can control that? And smoking it no less, the ROA that is guaranteed to have you gacked and up for days + wanting more. <br /><br /><br />By all means, give your experiment a go. But we all did warn you of what would happen.&nbsp; It really is a joke to say you&#039;re just going to smoke meth once a day or w/e. You don&#039;t get to decide what to do the meth does it for you.

The carb is meant for air. You want to gently hit while you&#039;re lighting form underneath. Keeping your flame at least an inch and a half away. Don&#039;t ever touch the bowl with direct flame. Gently hit though carb to pull air through the bowl. The reason you do this is you&#039;re trying to use fresh air to cool the meth. Think of it like this. You&#039;re trying to reach that certian temp that meth vapes at and keep it at that temp. So by lowering your flame (pulling away from bowl slowly) and pulling colder air through the carb. You are trying to keep the enviorement inside the bowl as controlled as possible. It takes some practice to get good at it. Also, slowly twirling the bowl, helps the meth run and not stick in one spot and flash. Take your time on hits and try to see how many hits u can get off one puddle. If you do it right, the meth should disapear in front of your eyes. Start with meth because mdpv is one of the hardest things i have ever vaped because of it&#039;s flash point and vape point being so close together it makes it really hard not to make it combust. I know it sounds crazy but you work your way up to mdpv by getting some practice on meth. Meth seems to be more forgiving of burning. If you take the time to make mdpv freebase that&#039;s the best way to go.

				Meth is my weapon of choice but there&#039;s a science to it, i always have my xanax to help put my mind to sleep and help me avoid staying up and getting into neurotoxicity and always drink a ton of water and eat something every 4-5hrs even if its just a protein bar or shake. If you have had an addiction in the past I would absolutely warn against trying it especially since the substance you were abusing was in the same family tree.

				BS, adderall is a non-addictive drug? <br /><br />can you please provide some evidence and cite the sources for that claim?<br /><br />imo it most certainly has the potential to be addictive... its a dopamine releasing agent/re-uptake inhibitor - basically the definition of an addictive drug from a neuropharmacology viewpoint (just like meth except less potency and basically no intrinsic serotonergic activity)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Read the sticky about meth on the top of the forums in this section, its great!<br /><br />Also, meth is very similar to other amphetamines, about 1.3-1.5 times as strong as dex which is the main amphetmaine in adderall.<br />If you are used to taking 30mg of adderall, I would start out with no more than 30mg meth etc... remember that unlike adderall you can never be 100% sure of how many mg of methamphetamine you are actually taking, street meth can be as low as 10% pure while some of the stuff here on SR is over 90% pure but it can never be more than 100% pure so when trying a new batch always assume the amount you weight out is 100% pure meth to be safe and adjust from there.

				why am i getting cold hands and feet on meth! i hate it , no vitamins cure it either!<br /><br />ahhhhhh<br /><br />its really strange, i smoked maybe 60-80mg today, and the smoking last only 2 hours and i start to come down hard. and feel like shit, irritable and whatever...<br /><br />i noticed last night that after 2 hours is up, i could head to bed. which i did and got a shitty 4 hour sleep!<br />amazing, but true!<br />kind of makes me wonder<br /><br />i just want to get rid of my remainder before friday, so i don&#039;t have to deal with this stuff again (srs)<br />fun, but not for me to get addicted to, and waste my life on.<br /><br />i tried heroin this past week before meth for my first time, and that is another drug i would never really be willing to buy again (even though the high was second to a poppy pod high, the addictiveness(and goodness of the shit) will always bring me back if i wasn&#039;t careful.)<br /><br />i already wasted 2 years of my life on various other drugs, got clean for 1 year 1/2. now here i am<br />a person with self-control and moderation !<br /><br />so i&#039;ve learned that these drugs with very high addiction rates, are not worth for me to fuck around with <br />i don&#039;t have time for it. i work 6 days a week, and i workout 6 days a week as well.<br />when i do drugs, i can&#039;t workout, and that is my love.<br />so, all in all if a person is focused on goals in there life and has direction, its a straight shooter!<br /><br /><br />no interest in buying meth (no fiending) after this is done<br /><br />so, you guys were all wrong, who doubted me!<br />thanks =)

				sorry wrong word for the pipe.<br />it is a meth pipe.<br /><br />i can get pretty decent hits, not huge huge dragon clouds though, like people speak of<br /><br />also to the last poster, haha<br />the thing about the internet, is that you can only say so much in words, but it really all comes down to the real life &quot;right or wrong&quot;<br />i have a choice<br /><br />the choice is: abuse said drug, and waste more months and years off my life, of not remembering shit, fucking my family over etc.<br />OR<br />i could not abuse it, use in moderation, have self-control and not ever use it again at all<br /><br />for me, like is said, words only speak so loud.<br />the side effects, and damage i&#039;ve done from a drug (physically/mentally) are wearing enough, to say &quot;fuck no i&#039;m not going back&quot;<br />but if you are a person who is coined an addict, you know the insides and outs.<br />if you have been to rehab you know what i mean, i will never end up back there, but i did it for myself a year 1/2 ago.<br /><br />so. in the end i&#039;m sorry if you have a more psychologically addicting personality.<br />YESSS, heroin and METH are fucking addicting drugs(the most addicting i&#039;ve ever touched)<br />but the point of the matter is, that i understand this!<br />and i can let it ruin my life again if i was not careful<br /><br />BACK to the topic though<br /><br />i&#039;m smoking the best quality on SR<br />i might like snorting better, MUCH more energy for me from snorting<br />smoking is more like, relaxed energy, tweaked, mind-fuck nice high<br /><br />thoughts?<br />

Snorting normally messes my head up. Smoking normally feels smoother to me. Sometimes taking a hit can be relaxing to me.

People just move too damn slow when i snort it. Also, smoking doesn&#039;t waste much if you have proper tools and know how to properly run the ice. Smoking anything is normally fiendish. What i found really weird about ice is that shooting it (The few times i played with the needle.) seemed to be less fiendish than smoking. Well, i guess i could say i wouldn&#039;t fiend as long. It seemed i would approch baseline quicker with shooting vs smoking which felt like a smoother comedown.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I normally go through drpvmd.

If someone yawns next to you, do you then yawn because they took more oxygen out the room? Did you just yawn thinking about yawning? <br /><br />If i smoke too much in too short of a time period i&#039;ll pant like a dog. It makes no sense, but sure enough it&#039;ll happen. I&#039;ve checked my o2 stats during this and they are fine. If i think about it, i can stop it. But, if i&#039;m not paying attetion to it, sometimes other will notice and ask me if i&#039;m ok. I belive i&#039;m hyperventalating, but if i think about it i can stop it so i&#039;m assuming it&#039;s anxiety. (I normally get it when i&#039;m crashing and not during or right after smoking sessions.)<br /><br />interesting man, yeah i will take a break from smoking tomorrow<br /><br />my lungs are totally fucked today, have to take deep breaths, and have to catch my breath!<br />fuckkkkkkkk<br />not going to smoke meth again =/<br /><br />it honestly feels like i smoked 3 packs a day since i started smoking meth this monday( thats how my lungs feel)<br /><br />when i chain smoke cigarettes or have too much in a certain amount of time, the same shit happens with my lungs!!!!<br /><br /><br />snorting it is then!!<br /><br />guys what is a normal dose that people do during a day of meth?<br /><br />like what do people snort in one-go? 30-50mg? <br />i am curious<br /><br />Also, onset of snorting is 3 to 5 minutes.

I find that hard to belive if you have used drugs and hung around the people you claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;Addy&#039;s were the first stimulant i played with. That&#039;s when i discovered my love for speed. They were a nice escape from the everyday grind. I attended school, played on the football team, and worked a part time job. Having something that helped me get through was an escape. <br /><br />It wasn&#039;t until six years later i tried meth. Baby steps. :P I knew that meth was going to be one of my loved drugs the momment i took that first hit. The thing is i&#039;m able to put the stimulants away eaiser than xanax. I had an addiction to xanax and quit cold turkey leading to seizures. (Brain feeling like it&#039;s melting.) That was the hardest thing i ever quit. Quitting nicotine, and caffiene, and addys had nothing on xanax. But, to each is own. Some people can kick downers easy, some people can kick uppers easy, and some shouldn&#039;t touch either.

Because your whole demeanor and approach towards substances is pretty fucked up as far as I can tell.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />wow you guys are fucked in the head, seriously<br />if you were perscribed xxxx amount of drugs. went to college, parents paid for everything, had the time of your life.<br />and were young dumb and stupid, you would do a fuck load amount of drugs with your friends right?<br />only makes sense , especially the place i live, it is all rich people. so<br />you, only can take so much from an internet conversation my friend.<br /><br />wait, really did i not explain myself enough in my posts. are you guys delusional, is this real life?<br />for the guy that has been to rehab, do you have any relatives, family members that have addictive personalities?<br />i could only imagine the line of people in your family.<br /><br />luckily for me there was no one that was addicted to drugs. i did drugs regularly to alleviate the pain i went through growing up, i didn&#039;t enjoy it, struggled in school, many many many many many many things, i don&#039;t even want to go into.<br />so, this was my escape. <br /><br />i myself, checked myself into rehab, because my life was just shit. i had a beautiful girlfriend at the time, but i was just not right in the head, you realize many things when you do drugs, especially psychedelics. realize what went wrong and what i could do better. this was rock bottom though, depression was the worst , and anxiety to the max. <br /><br />so, i would never say i was addicted to one single drug. i loved to do every drug<br />and when you go to rehab motherfuckers, they coin you an addict, whether you like it or not<br />i went to rehab for help , mentally. i needed support. not therapist support, because i tried that shit, mostly group shit where i could interact and connect with other fellow people like me<br /><br /><br />so you guys have your heads wayyyyyyy up your asses to think otherwise. never judge a person through the internet, appreciate you deep concern though. good luck<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You know...this is exactly what my fiance did, thought, said before he overdosed and died in his sleep 369 days ago. Man, I am so sorry that you&#039;ve convinced yourself that you&#039;re not an addict but you know you&#039;re a master manipulator...to everyone. You know better than anyone that you&#039;ve mastered the art in deceiving not just yourself (and you&#039;re full aware of your own bullshit) but everyone around you too.<br />I know you&#039;re convinced you have things under control. But look at the posts that you&#039;ve made on this thread (before and after doing the meth). Take a look at how you&#039;ve blatantly disregarded everyone&#039;s advice on how much of a devil this drug can be. Take a look at yourself in the mirror. Seriously, go ahead and find a shiny, reflective surface and tell me you see a whole person.<br />I must, however, state that I am proud of you for asking for advice, instead of completely blindly jumping into this with no knowledge whatsoever; perhaps that will save you from killing yourself(believe I don&#039;t wish this on you or anyone-simply meant death can happen unfortunately).<br />As a final word, I heed, an addict myself, having loved (still love) an addict that put me through so much hell and has lost his life, I strongly recommend that you as an addict, put the drugs away before your demons consume you.<br /><br />“There is something in our self-destructive personalities that cries for failure.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Basic Text, p. 80

				Meth does have a terriable comedown. That&#039;s why most people refer to it as a crash. Most people don&#039;t take care of themself during the high leading to a horriable crash. They allow themself to go through starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and some don&#039;t keep up with proper hygiene. Those things alone would make a person feel terriable. <br /><br />When i first get my bag, i start my timer. (It&#039;s an app on my phone that goes off every hour and makes a differant sound every 6 hours.) When the first timer goes off it. I ask myself have i been drinking plenty of water in the last hour? On average i&#039;ll drink anywhere between 4 to 6 bottles of water a day.&nbsp; When the timer goes off at the 6 hour mark. I force myself to eat something. It doens&#039;t have to be a full course meal, but something to put in my tummy and i drink a protien shake. I also take various vitamin supplements such as multi, b complex, vitamin c, and various herbs. I&#039;ve actually got to the point where my brain is becoming conditioned to wanting something to eat every 6 hours. It&#039;s differant than being hungry. It&#039;s more of a thought that pops in my head that says. &quot;It&#039;s time to eat something now&quot; <br /><br />If you think meth has a bad comedown, you have no idea what you&#039;re in for when it comes to benzo and H WD&#039;s. I wish you the best of luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;I hope you don&#039;t have to become addicted to stop or loose everything you love. Playing with such powerful things is a slipery slope. You&#039;re literaly gambling with your brain chemistry. I can&#039;t judge because i do the same.

I can say that i agree with a few of your points. <br /><br />I agree about overdosing with prescription medication vs powders. You contradicted yourself on the point about aderall being an escape, but i think i can see your point. You have a differant definition of escape. What substances do you belive are used to escape? <br /><br />Also, i think when you compare substances on how addictive they are based on your life experiences. It makes it harder to understand why others have a certian problem with other substances or even activites. I know a women that is addicted to changing her clothes many times a day. I understand that it&#039;s common for some&nbsp; women, but she literaly freaks out if she can&#039;t change her clothes at least seven times each day. She plans every morning these outfit changes and plans them to a certian time in the day. I normally change my clothes after a shower and going to bed.&nbsp; My point is that you might not see amphetamine being a more addictive substance than caffeine, but i&#039;ve yet to see someone rob someone over a cup of tea. I can&#039;t say the same about amphetamine. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=50267.msg547779#msg547779">Quote from: BobSacamano1 on October 26, 2012, 08:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=50267.msg546851#msg546851">Quote from: smokeweed420 on October 26, 2012, 06:21 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i couldnt stop doing it every day until i realized what i was doing(today) I dumped the rest in the toilet and flushed it&nbsp; because i know if i had it i would do it tommorow and every day after .....
