				Hey all,<br />I ordered 100mg of alpra powder from a new vendor but before I try it I just want to check a few things.<br /><br />1 - Any easy way to verify that it&#039;s pure? The vendor said he&#039;d done tests and that is was 99.9%, but has said he can&#039;t show any of the actual results for some reason, and I wanted to make sure I wouldn&#039;t be getting ripped off.<br /><br />2 - I was planning to mix/dissolve it in PG, so it&#039;s be 1mg/ml, then dose using 1ml syringes. I&#039;ve looked into dosage but wasn&#039;t sure. I used to have xanax bars but I assume dosages for pure powder are different? If so, what are they? Like 0.5mg is x, 1mg is y, 2mg is z etc in terms of effects and/or the equivalent in bar form.<br /><br />3 - Obviously I don&#039;t want to be addicted/suffer any long term damage from use. Would once a week be okay in terms of this? Just I find I have panic attacks roughly that often (I write them down after) and xanax isn&#039;t available where I live from any other way. I&#039;m well aware of the dangers of benzo WD, so don&#039;t want to risk getting addicted, but obviously still want to use them. <br /><br />Thanks in advance

				So you&#039;re planning to dose one milligram a week?<br /><br />There&#039;s no way in hell you&#039;ll get withdrawal symptoms or an addiction from that. My psychiatrist has me taking a milligram 5/7 days a week for the workday anxiety, said that for a few months until my life&#039;s a bit more stable I wouldn&#039;t develop a habit, and I don&#039;t feel like shit on weekends and don&#039;t get cravings for it. It also only dumbs me down a bit, it isn&#039;t exactly a &#039;high&#039;- though that may be due to me having a high baseline anxiety level.

				1mg a week is not nearly enough to develop a true addiction.&nbsp; But, that may not be the case if you do it for months then try to stop.&nbsp; Then you will really know if you&#039;re addicted, the withdrawals are a nightmare.&nbsp; Just a tip, if you start having withdrawals, do not quit cold turkey, taper off gradually.&nbsp; Best of luck.

I suppose this solution would have a rather unpleasant taste though: PG as such is pretty nice, but xanax is rather bitter, and i doubt the taste of PG would offset that by much, though i&#039;ve never tried myself. <br /><br />Using 1 mg once a week or so would carry very little risk of dependence, at least not physically. There can be psychological dependence that causes you to have more trouble confronting the anxiety inducing situation without xanax in the future. This will not cause any adverse effects (like cravings, withdrawal) when you avoid the anxiety trigger, but could cause you to be unable to confront the trigger without medication whereas you were able to work your way (in discomfort) through it before.

				Glycerin is not a very convenient or good solvent to use at all - its too viscous at room temperature to be practical, and the kinetics of getting alprazolam dissolved in it are not favourable, although the thermodynamics are okay. <br /><br />Ethanol would be a good solvent, and it doesn&#039;t have to be all that pure to work. I don&#039;t have the exact data here, but something like 100 proof spirit (50% ethanol in water) sounds like a fine solvent to make 1 mg/ml solutions. I suppose at room temperature even ordinary 80 proof vodka would be a suitable solvent too. <br /><br />If for some reason high proof spirits are hard to find in your country, i would suggest using methanol-tainted alcohol as a solvent. Additives such as methanol are often added to alcohol intended for sterilizing wounds and such to discourage drinking it as booze, and methanol is quite dangerous to your health in amounts of the mixture that would actually get you drunk. <br /><br />If you look at a solution in a total volume of 1 ml per dose or so, the risks are very limited. Even if your solvent was 10% methanol in 90% ethanol, ingesting 1 ml of that solvent containing only 100 uL of methanol would not pose a serious health risk from the methanol. Spirits such as scotch will often contain a small amount of methanol and/or propanol as well, and this really poses little health risk as long as the amounts are small. <br /><br />Drinking methanol in the volumes you would ethanol certainly is dangerous and leads to blindness, insanity, liver failure and what not, but we are looking at less then a percent involved in that here. As methanol occurs naturally in numerous foodstuffs in small amounts we are actually able to process small amounts of it without adverse effect, and many of us do so on a daily basis without ever noticing.

				It&#039;s not a great testing method, because you can&#039;t really know what it is, but when I ordered Xanax powder I used my marquis test and it provided absolutely no reaction. In fact, the powder didn&#039;t even really dissolve. Benzo powder is hard core stuff, it basically takes pure alcohol to dissolve. Then take a tiny amount(pin needle tip amount) and see what the effects are.<br /><br />I eventually came to the conclusion that my power was legit, and now I just use a little plastic fork and scrap residue of the sides of the baggie and I&#039;m guessing I get between .25 and 1mg each time. I would like to dissolve it and use it as a liquid for accurate dosage, but the main reason I use the Xanax is when I&#039;m hung over or something from partying the night before, last thing I want to do is take a shot of alcohol lol. <br /><br />Just be careful, powder benzos are not to be played with.&nbsp;

Even capping the container and running it under HOT tap water will work well. Swirl it around and help it dissolve and watch for evaporation!&nbsp; <br />Maybe try a small test batch at first?&nbsp; If it&#039;s legit powder, a pinpoint should get you off nicely but it&#039;s easy to misjudge if you aren&#039;t careful. <br /><br />Please let us know how things go and maybe pm some of us the vendor if you aren&#039;t comfortable posting here. I have been looking for a good A. powder distributor since Arn0ld/Oliver! <br /><br />Good luck! <br /><br />And +1, Ben! Great post.
