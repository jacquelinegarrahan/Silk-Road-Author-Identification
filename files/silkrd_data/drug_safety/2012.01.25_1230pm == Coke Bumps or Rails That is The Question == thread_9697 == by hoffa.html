				Interested to hear peoples opinion on which is best for the best rush and longest lasting.<br /><br />I personally cut and pretty fat line, and only recently have I snorted a bump. The bump gives you a much quicker rush IMO but doesn&#039;t last that long. Maybe I am not doing it right?<br /><br />So really looking at best method for the best outcome. Not into IVing!<br /><br />Hoffa

				Nice big lines if I am at home or in my mate&#039;s pub and can get away with it, somewhere more civilized and I do bumps out of a bullet.

				Nice Bigglesworth!<br /><br />So the question is how do we get the mucus to come back quicker? I alternate between nostrils but it does come a point when the coke has little effect (obviously during a binge session) and you know its a waste but you just can&#039;t stop&nbsp; :-[ <br /><br />Cheers again

				I need to try the nasal spray thing.&nbsp; Binged twice this past week and it pisses me off cause I know by the end of the night or early morning, I&#039;m wasting my stash but the brain keeps asking for more.<br /><br />Starting out with fat lines while the sinuses are &quot;fresh&quot; then switching to bumps from a bullet works well for me.&nbsp; As others have mentioned, he delivery to your system is different.<br /><br />Still love this shit though.<br /><br />BF
