				My first try was a 20mg dose, it gave me some visuals, some gigles, great euphoria especially after i smoked some weed. <br />That launched me up high for an hour but i easely regained full control when the weed starting wearing off.<br /><br />This time i have ordered 5 pills and partly because im currently out of weed and partly because i wanted to try a higher dose i went with 30mg.<br />I tried to cut one pill in two with a knife but was left with alot of little chunks and halve a pill. <br />I put these on my tongue and swallowed with some soda.<br />The trip itself started out like i remembered my first trip felt like, i had alot of gigles, objects started breathing and glowing.<br />I put some infected mushroom on and downloaded winamp to check out its visualiser which turned out to be VERY good way better then wm and it kept me in awe for an unknown time.<br />The visuals distortions kept getting more intense and i also started feeling a bodyload, partly a stoney dizzy feeling partly altertered sensations of touch and taste.<br />I experienced the most sensations on my tongue where i had put the small chunks, it felt tingly and elektrical and i had a strong metalic taste making everything taste awfull.<br />I reached a point where the music started feeling to loud and started feeling anxious, i shut down winamp and was left with loud buzzing noise my computer makes.<br />Its a very hot cpu (pentiumD) with a standard intel high pitched sounding cooler which runs full speed almost 100% of the time.<br />I started feeling poisoned by its sound and my mood turned from very uplifted and gigly to very down, feeling sick and depressed.<br />I tried escaping this feeling by turning off the computer and all the lights and laying on my bed but the noise from outside also felt deafening and poisoned.<br />I learned escaping a hard trip is not an option and the term eyes wide shut now has a new meaning for me.<br />The trip turned introspective and i experienced a whirlwind of emotions mostly of things wrong with my life, all the while accompanied by intense CEV&#039;s.<br />I was quickly heading to a panic attack but managed to accept the bad thoughts and the fact the trip itself was not something i was gonna escape.<br />I made peace with the fact i had to ride it out and let everything come to me without fighting it. I learned alot and also started thinking about how to better some aspects of life, i slowly started feeling at ease again.<br />I decided to try to keep busy to distract my brain and fired up my PS3, i played the demo of heavy rain which turned out to be an awesome game. At this time i was allready coming down and playing the game reduced the intesity of the visuals alot.<br />The game also had some funny, be it dark, characters and i started gigling again and my trip turned to smooth and uplifting again.<br />I still had the altered sensation on my mouth though and i felt pretty exhausted. I also started having a pretty bad headache the more i came down, this prevented me from falling asleep.<br />I took a painkiller and a high dose of GHB to knock me out. This morning a woke up feeling like a wreck and i called in sick to work.<br /><br />After my first time i thought i had found a new very enjoyable toy for me to play with, this second experience kicked my ass.<br />2CB is VERY powerfull when you take more then 20mg and it will turn into a full trip not just some cute visuals and giggles.<br />So be warned, if you want to try higher doses go in small steps and expect something alot more intense and deeper.<br />That being said, despite waking up still exhausted and having experienced a bad and dark episode this trip, i mentally felt ok. I&#039;m at peace with the bad stuff and plan to use some of the advice to better my life.<br />After calling in sick and went back to bed and woke up fully rested and amazed with everything i went through. I still cant wait to try it again although i wont be taking 30mg&#039;s again for now hehehe<br />Next time will be 25mg hopefully with some weed.<br /><br /><br />grts,<br /><br />sam

				Well this is as far as strong doses (&gt;20mg) are involved. You could have 15-18 mg and have a pleasant trip.

				Yeah more is less with this stuff. The good news is it&#039;s hard to die from taking too much, the bad news is that the body load and general distortion of reality creeps up pretty fast once you move into the visual doseage range (i.e. &lt;20mg for most people). I tend to enjoy it most with something else anyway. The body high is all right but it keeps my mind a little too grounded while fucking up the entire world around me. Can get hard to connect the two to turn it into a fun ride. Mostly I like a small dose, 5-10mg for a little body buzz when I want to have some relations with the girl and maybe 10-15 for a nice comedown off an MDMA roll.<br /><br />The few times I have done bigger doses on it&#039;s own I am normally left feeling like I&#039;m missing something. There&#039;s no real universal expansion of my mind to compensate for all the crazy shit happening in the world around me if that makes sense. It&#039;s not bad per se, just not amazing on it&#039;s own for me in my trials. Even just a bit of pot helps with that though.

				What I have heard the drugs affects go up exponentially instead of linear where 30mg will not be twice as strong as 15mg but exponentially stronger. Drugs affect everyone differently where 20mg might just be right for someone it might not be enough or to much for others.&nbsp; Also depend how you take it Oral you need ruffly twice as much as you need from snorting and even less when you plug it.<br /><br />I tried 2C-B firt the first time (first psychedelic experience as well) in club the other week and took 35mg of powder. 20mg Ingested followed by snorting 15mg T1:30+ because I had not gotten any visuals. I do admit that was very intense I spend the first 30 or so minutes battling it but I eventually got control and had an awesome experience.

				It also may have had something to do with a tek called pre dosing. In which you take very small amounts of the said substance over a coarse of a few days, to ease the intro on the new substance to your mind and body. Then when you take an actual dose a week later, you will feel it full effect, and have a much higher chance at a smooth experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;For example, the first time or three some ones drops LSD..many people, my self included, hardly feel anything until the second, third, or forth trip..then you are able to feel micro doses. Same for me with K, when i introduce friends to it in the past, the first time or two they claimed to not have felt much, not nearly where ill be with the same dosage. Now if i so much as smell a bag or jar of the kitty, i get a buzz.<br /><br />I&nbsp; can only assume that same goes for the Beez. There is a sticky thread on crystal meth, that goes on to explain this pre-dosing technique in detail. Much love

				Glad you survived the experience! I&#039;ve slowly been ramping up my max does on the Beez, I think I&quot;m going for 25-27 next time, 22 was quite manageable. I find it interesting how much the duration changes as the dose increases, at least for me. 10mg with intermittent pot usage gave me about 4-5 hours of fun, but definitely was on its way down after 3. 20 mg and I was still going strong after smoking pot at the 5 hour mark.<br /><br />Love the Beez!!!
