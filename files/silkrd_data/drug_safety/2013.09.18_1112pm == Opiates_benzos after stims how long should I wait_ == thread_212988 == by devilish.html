				Just a quick background was taking mephedrone at the weekends for a while until I had a bad experience, it&#039;s been a few months now since i last used it and I really would like to use it again and i&#039;m planning on doing 200mg, it&#039;s just my fiendish side will probably not let me stop there.<br /><br />So I plan on taking some opiates/benzos for the comedown my question is how long should I wait after my last line to dose the opiates (or benzos depends how i&#039;m feeling at the time) and can there be any added stress on the heart as I still get mild pains.<br /><br />Thanks for your replies guys.<br /><br />p.s will be oxycodone or alprazolam if that makes a difference

				Ah meph is a difficult one to control, we&#039;ve all been there!<br /><br />I have never had any problems using benzos after meph sessions of all lengths, I have used Xanax, Valium, Etizolam and a few others with no problems.<br /><br />I would wait until your buzz is waning before taking it, before you start to feel shit though, I love it when I get a smooth transition from high to chilled at the end of a session. If you have Xanax it kicks in quickly so you could just wait until you naturally want to chill/sleep.

				I use benzos when I have had enough of the stim don&#039;t wait at all.<br /><br />I never take benzos with opiates though as a much more naive me took&nbsp; 3x10 or might have been 15mg&nbsp; generic oxys 4mg of chewy indian banana tasting&nbsp; Klonopin at the same time and my lights went out for 6 hours non of this drifting off just suddenly out cold this was about a Decade ago and I learnt a lesson that day one I never repeated.

				Thanks for the replies guys, Think I will knock myself out with some xanex and then save the opiates for the day after if I feel a bit down but hopefully after only 2 lines the comedown will be unnoticeable compared to some of the binges I have done in the past.

				Sounds like a plan mate - much better for the day after, combine nicely with the mephedrone afterglow (before the crushing comedown - but you won&#039;t get a comedown at all from one hit). Have fun!
