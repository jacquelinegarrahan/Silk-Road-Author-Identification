				i dont think any sorta weed makes u wanna dance or party m8 lol<br /><br />but if ur looking for something that doesnt make u sleep or lay about all day half comatosed, i would suggest u stick to mainly a sativa dominant strain, eg purple haze, as indica strains usually give u a heavy couchlock stone...<br /><br />hope this helps, i take it u dont smoke alot of weed buddy haha

				If you&#039;re going to smoke when you&#039;re heading out, beer before bud as a rule. If you&#039;re drunk first, being stoned generally adds to it well ...if you&#039;re stoned first then inexperienced users don&#039;t often get on too well ;)<br /><br />Partying hardcore on a night out for me is Es or Coke, weed doesn&#039;t fit the profile.<br /><br />EDIT: ...and you definitely want a Sativa dominant strain as said before.

				Sativas have a high THC content and a low CBD content. CBD (Cannabidiol) counteracts some of the effects of THC and makes you stoned. So Sativas produce a head high, while most Indicas produce a body high. <br /><br />You could also use a vaporizer with adjustable temperature to get the head high. CBD vaporizes at a higher temperature than THC, so if you use low temperatures you will (mostly) only vaporize the THC. Then you could collect the partly vaporized weed and vaporize it again at a higher temperature later when you want to go to relax/sleep. Or you use it for cooking or creating oil with mostly CBD content.

Haze and diesel strains come to mind, and they are fairly common on SR. Many find blue dream to be a good hybrid that boasts a very uplifting head high.

				Sour Diesel gives me energy. The last time I smoked some sour d I remember being able to do some crazy things... like I accidentally threw my grinder (i know, how do i do this? was just so high) and managed to lunge my arm towards it in the air and catch it lol. Funny thing was everyone around me didn&#039;t not see it except for one of my friends which it was his first time getting high and he started tripping but he used a vape the rest of us smoked.

				Wow, maybe I&#039;m a little screwy but Sativa (yes, diesel and the haze&#039;s) does the exact opposite for me.&nbsp; Give me a good Indica mixes with some hash and I&#039;m all ready for a night out (especially if you add in some coffee).&nbsp; Sativa&#039;s just knock me out, feel like they make me schizo.&nbsp; Then again I smoke way too much when I&#039;m smoking.
