				Just purchased the whipped cream dispenser and got some &quot;purewhip&quot; dispensers, i screw it in and press so the gas comes out but how long am i supposed to breathe in the gas? do I go for multiple hits? How do I know when to stop? step by step would be greatly appreciated as we have tried but have no effects on us (we must be doing it wrong) thanks ahaha <br /><br />

				You might want to fill one of those kids punching bag balloons with the gas, and then inhale it all at once, and hold it in as long as you can. Then you&#039;ll be hearing the wah-wahs.

				It doesn&#039;t work that well to inhale from the dispenser. Like the Hippie said, get some balloons. They don&#039;t have to be punch balloons, just get the largest ones you can find. My friend bought weather balloons from an army surplus store once. It takes at least three of those whippit cartriges in one balloon to have a good time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Never use a bag or a mask. Ever! I know a guy who died by hooking up a mask to an N2O tank.

				when i did it i would fill up a balloon and inhale in - out, in- out fast till everything is gone from it if i could not clear it in one go. <br />Just inhale lay back hold it a bit and enjoy! 15 seconds of bliss.<br />

				As above, put a balloon over the end of the dispenser and fill it up.<br /><br />Inhale the whole balloon over 2 inhales, breathing back into the balloon in between.

				oh man this one time i took shrooms and e then got an irresistible urge to do nitrous. i loaded the thing up, used my last balloon and the fuckin thing burst on me! i trekked all around town looking to buy some balloons to no avail. it was jubilee weekend ffs, you&#039;d think there would be balloons about. anyway went back to my flat, got a clean rubbish sack (garbage bag innit) tied a rubber band around the open end to create a balloon like device and it worked just fine. obviously don&#039;t stick your head in the bag, you&#039;ll suffocate and die. consider this an emergency back up option not your number one choice.<br />you get a better rush if you breathe out as much as you possibly can before inhaling the nitrous. its probably best to try it normally first though

				When I do N2O I breathe in and out slowly and deeply a few times before inhaling the balloon. I then breathe in and out of the balloon until I can&#039;t feel I&#039;m getting anymore nitrous from it, sit back and have 30 seconds of fun :D

				Ok so i tried to hyperventalate before inhaling the gas but does the brand of the dispenser make a difference? I inhaled all of the gas in one go and didn&#039;t feel as fucked up as steve-o or others on youtube look.&nbsp; any sugggestions?
