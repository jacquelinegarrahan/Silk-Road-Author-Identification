				I would appreciate as much information as possible. Oxys aren&#039;t available around these parts. Codeine 30mgs are the strongest things to become addicted to in these parts. How strong are Oxys in comparison and how does the rush compare to snorting coke? I couldn&#039;t imagine the buzz better than Coke as Coke is a good social buzz whereas opiates are more of a downer.

				Codeine is really shitty IMO. Even 10mg of oxy is way better than 500mg of codeine, codeine just make me itchy all over and not euphoric at all, even when I take a lot of promethazine. Low doses are kind of okay but it&#039;s nothing like oxy.<br />Oxy can be pretty social, it&#039;s almost emphathogenic and makes you want to talk to everyone :) Obviously in high doses it&#039;s not gonna be like that but still. I&#039;ve never had cocaine so I can&#039;t really say how both compare, but it&#039;s definitely more euphoric than speed, and speed is said to feel kind of like cocaine so I don&#039;t know.

				Why is Oxy so expensive? I see £60 for one 80mg pill. How does it compare to straight up morphine, in terms of effects and also valuation on the street.

On the streets you can find roxi 30s (the injectable, snortable IR oxy) for $8-$12 and not $35 like on SR. Morphine is more euphoric but it pretty much has to be injected to not be expensive, any other route is inefficient. There&#039;s some cheap enough morphine IR on SR, unlike oxy.

				I&#039;ve heard of people cooking the OP&#039;s in the microwave, search it if you want, to get rid of the plastic. Ive tried snorting the new. its not the same.&nbsp; I get 30mg roxys they are good but NOTHING like the old 80mg OCs those used to be 50 bucks around here and with a low tolerance would last a couple days But Ive had a couple friends die.

In hindsight it seems like I should&#039;ve bought those, since roxis are hard to come by, for some reason they still seem insanely cheap compared to you.. You guys are pretty unlucky! $8 is the absolute cheapest you can have, it&#039;s not that common to find them for that cheap but it&#039;s pretty nice when you do ;)

				Morphine isn&#039;t as strong as oxy orally, oxy is around 2 times as strong as strong as morphine. Morphine is 3 times as strong when IV&#039;d though so that&#039;s why oral morphine kinda sucks, and snorting it is even worse.<br /><br />I agree that cooking OPs is not a good idea, OPs should be taken orally. To do so you can let them sit for a day in some coke and it basically become IR then. I&#039;ve heard that leaving them sit in dry acetone for 12-14 hours will get most of the oxy out, so you could just let the acetone evaporate and you&#039;d have some pretty safe to inject oxy then.

				Sorry for the numbers.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t intending to be specific, but I see how I should have double checked.<br /><br />Anhydrous acetone is the key from what I&#039;ve heard as well.&nbsp; I have never even done oxy, so I&#039;m not too bothered with the whole thing.<br /><br />I appreciate the correction.
