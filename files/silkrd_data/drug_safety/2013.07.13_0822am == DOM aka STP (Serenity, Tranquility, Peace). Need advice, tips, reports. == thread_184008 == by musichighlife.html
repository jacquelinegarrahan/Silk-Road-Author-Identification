				So as we all well know, we are blessed to have this resource in the Road to be able to acquire some rare and delectable mind altering substances. One of the ones I&#039;ve been debating on taking the plunge or not is DOM also known as STP. As a precursor, I&#039;ve journeyed plenty with psilocybin, LSD, DMT, MDMA, salvia, and some of the newer RC&#039;s. I&#039;ve yet to come across DOM but have done a fair amount of research and I&#039;m very intrigued to test out the experience. I&#039;ve yet to have a bad psychedelic experience mostly due to my mindset, my preparation, and routine that I have for myself every time I&#039;m set to trip so I&#039;m not too worried about any of that. Just wanted to reach out to my fellow travelers here for any advice or tips, possibly even some trip reports or just general insight and knowledge to maybe help sway me either way. I&#039;d be purchasing off GrandWizardsLair as he has a fair price and is domestic US. I&#039;m aware its normally a LONG trip lasting anywhere from 10-12 hours peak with a 24 hour comeup to comedown total. This is one of the main draws among others.....So thanks in advance my friends.&nbsp; 8)

				Looks interesting :)<br />Of all the DOx series, DOC was the most appealing to me if I recall correctly. I think DOM would be interesting indeed though. Please come back with a report if you do take the plunge! The duration of this and DOB are pretty intimidating...I think it&#039;d be difficult to find the time to trip for that long.

I will definitely post a trip report if I indulge because I keep trip reports for personal reasons either way. It is a bit intimidating that duration but it also excites me to be able to explore my mind in that psychedelic state for that amount of time and see what comes of it. Thankfully I have a career that lends itself to more free time then most so I do have the time to journey for that long.

				For the DOx series I can highly recommend keeping some amphetamine and / or benzodiazepines on hand to smooth out the experience. In my heyday I had an experience with 120ug LSD, 3mg DOB, 30mg 2C-B, speed and some bk-MDMA - I honestly couldn&#039;t have gotten through that if I hadn&#039;t also been on speed. It kept me grounded, despite tripping harder than I thought possible [with the exception of DMT of course]. It was a full 24 hour experience, probably closer to 30 hours to baseline. Approach it like a meditation, allow yourself the time to trip and come down entirely. Most of all, enjoy it!

				From what I have read and heard from hippies who took it back in their day- DOM truly was the the pinacle of the psycadelic amphetamines.&nbsp; I had thought it was long gone and virtually unobtainable , until I saw it on SR recently.Mescaline was the only other substance that had made a more profound experience for those old hippies I spoke with about the subject. But mescaline, ampetamines are&nbsp; actually close relatives in the chemical family tree, alot of vriations drift between those 2 .<br /><br />I would love to try sometime, but at this point in time I do not have the time to take a 14 hour ish trip , or take the recovery time If it were needed afterward- maybe Ill get to try it after I retire..............
