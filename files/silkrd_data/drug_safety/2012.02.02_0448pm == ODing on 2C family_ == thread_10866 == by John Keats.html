				Title: <strong>ODing on 2C family?</strong><br />

				Alright so a couple questions...<br /><br />First, I want to try the 2C family. Which one should I start out with? 2C-E sells for the cheapest here on SR but looking over the forums people have said it is the least enjoyable.<br /><br />Second, I saw a new article where a Minnesota teen overdosed on 2C-E. How much would you have to take for any of the 2Cs to be dangerous? Can you combine the 2Cs with other substances? Other forums state that 2C-E is a &quot;vasoconstrictor&quot;... what is this exactly, how do I prevent damage from it, and how do I prevent risk of OD?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />John Keats

				Just be careful and don&#039;t try for heroic doses on chemicals we don&#039;t know all that much about. We&#039;ve had psilocybin and LSD for a much longer time, and we&#039;ve done research on those. With 2cs, MXE, NBOMEs, and pretty much any RC you should just keep to reasonable dosages.

I&#039;d look up the article, but I&#039;m too lazy; I remember reading about it on many other forums I went on. I feel like 2c-t-7 and 2c-e have too close of doses to be THAT fatal. But stick to the dosages on erowid and you should be pretty alright. Don&#039;t forget about harm reduction, too. I&#039;d honestly suggest you start with some of the other psychs, though, because in many cases they&#039;re easier to handle than the 2Cs. Of them, I&#039;d say start with 2C-I.

				Investigate the chemical you&#039;re going to take. Do &#039;allergy test&#039; before dosing. Always use well calibrated precise scales. Start with small/average doses and work your way up. Have a sitter for the first time with the chemical. <br /><br />

Whenever you get ANY chemical you should do something like:<br />1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg etc. Start small.
