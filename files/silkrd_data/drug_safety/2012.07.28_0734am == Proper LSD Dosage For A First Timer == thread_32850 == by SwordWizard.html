				What is a good dose of LSD for a first timer? I&#039;m thinking 100ug wouldn&#039;t be too much. Would I be able to function at that dose, walk around, play games, browse the internet, talk to friends, etc?

				Sure you&#039;ll be fine, LSD is kind of pushy, so keep in mind you will feel a push from the drug, kind of like a stimulation. Remember you&#039;re in control and all will be good!&nbsp; :)

				I recommend 200ug for first time doses. 300 is really magical, but that can be a little much for someone&#039;s first time. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let your experience with salvia taint your expectations for LSD. I despise salvia - I hate everything about the salvia experience... LSD is 100x more beautiful. <br /><br />I prefer to be overwhelmed and acclimate to a new drug rather than be underwhelmed by it.

				No, if you trip on LSD you will not want to, &quot;walk around, play games, browse the internet, talk to friends, etc?&quot;<br /><br />Personally, I took a small dose the my first time too, but as soon as I started to trip I wished I took the same dose as my friends. I&#039;d say go camping and take 200-300mic&#039;s ... 2 hits of good blotter. Bring a gallon of orange juice to drink while tripping ;)

				Build yourself a nest with bedding and cushions. Get yourself the biggest bag of ridiculously sugary lollies, a big bottle of water and a big bottle of juice. The take 600 - 700 ug.<br /><br />Honestly though, it really depends on you. If you&#039;re anxious at all the go small till you get a feel for it. For me 100 ug isn&#039;t tripping, just mild visual distortions and some stimulation, but you could be different. My approach with new psyches is to work out what the average does is (see places like Erowid) and then go just above that. It can be intense, but sometimes I want to have my mind shattered by a new experience, as it seems more meaningful than wading in.<br /><br />Have fun anyway :)

				Well, I really wanna walk around my campus at night my first time. I want it to be magical, I love the stars and the moon. But I don&#039;t want people noticing me acting oddly, especial Campus LEO. But I also don&#039;t want to take this and be underwhelmed by it my first time. Would you guys say that 200ug would be ok to have a decent experience and maneuver about?

				I would also recommend 200ug for the first time. I was doing a lot of research on LSD - its effects, dosage, time, set, setting, whatnot.<br /><br />Most people recommend that you should use more for your first time as the first time is always more magical. Think of it like E: The first time will be the most mind blowing thing.<br /><br />Just make sure that you really are taking 200ug instead of 400. After experiencing Salvia I think LSD will be pretty tame and controllable, aside from the extended trip time. I haven&#039;t had a chance to try ST&#039;s LSD that I got last month, and it&#039;ll be my first time whenever I get around to it! I hope the blotters haven&#039;t degraded due to transport and time...<br /><br />I would also suggest waiting in your room for the first hour and a half before going out, to see if you are comfortable with walking high. If you are OK, grab that bottle of juice you have in the fridge (get one) and open your door to a world of infinite possibilities.<br /><br />You may find that the sudden change in environment (inside &gt; outside) to be mentally stimulating. Imagine opening your door to an entirely new, natural world.

I would wait 3 hours at least. Sometimes on acid (i do not know the dosage of my blotters) I could not walk during the peak of the trip. So going out before the peak can be a bad idea.<br />But if the dosage is really low -- why not. Depends on what is low for you: my girlfriend has been totally freaked out after 1/2 of the blotter. I take 3/2 of the same blotter and I&#039;m pretty good.

				I dropped 125mcg my first time and it was a helluva time! I could still talk fine and walk around normally, hell, I even went for a bike ride I was so energetic! It was very euphoric, not very hallucinatory, the only visual changes I noticed were that some colors seemed brighter. Music sounded a lot better though, electronic/trance music is the best for an LSD trip in my opinion.<br /><br />I advise you to wait until just the right day to do it though. The perfect day would be one where you have no work to do, the weather is nice, and there aren&#039;t too many people around(or people that you don&#039;t like). Set and setting are important! Always go into an acid trip feeling confident and happy, never drop acid when in a bad mood! <br /><br />Good luck! It&#039;s quite a fun experience and if you follow the basics than I almost guarantee it&#039;ll be great time!

Usually I&#039;ll keep it in my mouth until I don&#039;t want it there any more - usually around half an hour. I&#039;m sure if you looked, you could find the ideal time for it to be there, you may not need to keep it under for half an hour but that&#039;s always worked for me!
