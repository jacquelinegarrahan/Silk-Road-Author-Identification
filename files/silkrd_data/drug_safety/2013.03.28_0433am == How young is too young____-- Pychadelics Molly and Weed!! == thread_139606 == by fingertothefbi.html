				Ok so first off no I&#039;m not under age.<br /><br />But I know a lot of people, friends with lil bros ect so as far as interested people Ive got ages 15-25 <br /><br />So how young is too young? Also should I give molly to a younger person because if I don&#039;t they will most likely get some e-pills laced with meth and caffeine that seem to make they way around these parts :( quite a paradox

				MDMA can be extremely neurotoxic if you don&#039;t prepare properly, therefore I wouldn&#039;t sell to anyone under 20 for that since brains are still developing into the 20&#039;s. As far as the others, weed is a no brainer as it only does good, and for any psychedelics I&#039;d probably feel morally comfortable selling to anyone over 18. I don&#039;t think some kids could handle some of the intense experiences that could be brought on by them. I don&#039;t condone selling to anyone under 18 though. Hell even when I was 18 I didn&#039;t know my ass from my head.<br /><br />Be careful out there, kids run their mouths and a protective mom who finds their kid tripping face on acid will always blame you.

Bollocks. I know many heavy smokers who can&#039;t go half a day without a spliff. Their favourite is skunk. What else do they have in common? They all started in their early teens! And it certainly doesn&#039;t do them any good, if it ever did.<br /><br />I would agree that psychedelics are safer than MDMA. Moderation is key however.
