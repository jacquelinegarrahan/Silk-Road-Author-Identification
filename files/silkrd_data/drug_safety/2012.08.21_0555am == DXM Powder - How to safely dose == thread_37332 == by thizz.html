				I was pleased to see DXM powder on the SR forums here... in many places DXM is not considered a legitimate recreational drug - even among drug users - so it is nice to see it offered here in pure powder form.&nbsp; DXM is a cough suppressant found in MANY different over the counter products.&nbsp; The problem is most of those products also contain other medications.&nbsp; It might be cool that something has a few hundred MG&#039;s of DXM but if it is loaded up with other chemicals such as Acetaminophen they are dangerous to use for the DXM content and could even prove fatal.&nbsp; If one wants to try DXM in over the counter form look for Robitussin Cough (Not cough and cold or cough and flu... just cough.&nbsp; Make sure the only active ingredient is DXM.&nbsp; It will say Dextromethorphan and give a MG amount.&nbsp; If you find Robitussin Cough it is about 400 mg per 4 OZ bottle (long acting cough is what is is going by now, but robitussin change the box and name from time to time to confuse drug users).&nbsp; &nbsp;If you find the cough gels where there are 20 in a bottle they are 300 mg&#039;s a bottle. <br /><br />Here is the important stuff in one line... Look on the back of the medicine and make sure on the label the only &quot;Active Ingredient&quot; listed is Dextromethorphan HBR - Then read how many MG&#039;s are in a dose and multiply by the total number of doses in a bottle.&nbsp; 300 - 500 is a good dose for beginners.&nbsp; Start at 300 because a few random people in this world have an enzyme deficiency of CYP2D6&nbsp; and this makes DXM more potent to the body.&nbsp; 300mg is a good beginner dose.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you dose powder find out if it is Dextromethorphan freebase, Dextromethorphan HBR, or Dextromethorphan Hydrocitrate.&nbsp; Those should be the only three sold in powder form and if if is one of the first two dose it with a shot of liquor to allow it to absorb.&nbsp; If it is Hydrocitrate then it will absorb on its own.&nbsp; Powder is slightly more potent than chugging the syrup and produces a cleaner trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Available at your local supermarket as cough medicine.&nbsp; Available on SR as pure DXM powder.<br />(Caution: Avoid Coriciden Cough and Cold (CCC&#039;s).&nbsp; Although popular as a drug these do not meet the requirement of having Dextromethorphan listed as the ONLY active ingredient and for this reason it can and will kill you over time.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t kill you it can make you bleed out of your eyeballs.&nbsp; Stick with products containing DXM only.<br /><br />Remember - start with 300mg&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />DXM only active ingredient.<br /><br />Enjoy, <br />Thizzle
