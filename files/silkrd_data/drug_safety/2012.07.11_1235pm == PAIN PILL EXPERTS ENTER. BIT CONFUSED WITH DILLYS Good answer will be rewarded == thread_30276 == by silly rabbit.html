I snorted a whole 8mg Dilly to myself and was pretty underwhelmed. They are a bitch to break down into powder as they are a very tight press. I would suggest getting a pedegg as it&#039;s the only thing that made turning it into powder doable. I suppose if you were totally opiate naieve and hadn&#039;t done anything in like 6 mo you could snort 4mg and feel something. Only problem is it&#039;s short half life and relatively &quot;light&quot; euphoria makes you want to re-dose in about an hour. If you&#039;re avoiding the needle I would try and sell these and get some old school opana or some roxi 30s.

				I&#039;ve done Dillies (IV&#039;d, snorted &amp; ingested) as well as legally Prescribed. Personally, I think Dilaudid is way over rated and too expensive. If your not at least snorting them, then it really is a big waste. For True pain issues, pretty much worthless as you peak quickly. Legs on Hydromorphine (at least to me) was a max of 3 to 4 hours. I would go as far as saying that Hydrocodone and especially Oxycodone has great legs of up to 6 hours, less expensive and easier to get. For pain, they are really good.<br /><br />Oxymorphone &lt;Opana&gt; and Heroin on the other hand are the Winners in my book for great relief of Pain as well as fantastic in the &quot;nod factor.&quot; However, both of these are hard to get. Heroin being the least expensive, Dillies &amp; Opana Most expensive.<br /><br />I can personally vouche that Opana is the Champagne of Opiates!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5fd8595931

There&#039;s actually a walkthrough I found on a clearnet site. <br /><br />Here it is:<br /><br />1 - Take the coating off<br />The simplest way I&#039;ve found so far is to use a shaving-type razor to take the coating off. Very lightly run the razor somewhat parallel with the portion of the pill you&#039;re cutting. If you mess up and manage to take a piece of the pill off with the coating, you can kind-of dig it out with the razor.<br /><br />2 - Grinding the pill<br />There have been several methods suggested for grinding the new OPs. They&#039;ve ranged from sanding blocks, pedicure eggs, cheese graters, and even Dremels. With this method of crisping, you want the product to be as fine as possible. We&#039;re talking powder here. Anything substantially bigger in size will lead to uneven heating and a burnt product. A Dremel with a sanding attachment works very well for this task. If you can&#039;t get a dremel, I&#039;d try for a pedi-egg as other members seem to have good results with them. With a Dremel, try to grind the pill in a container so you don&#039;t lose any product. When you&#039;re finished, place the ground OP on a piece of folded paper and then let it slide into a DRY spoon.<br /><br />3 - Crisping the product<br />Now&#039;s the time for the hard part. When the powder is in the spoon, try to spread it out with a paperclip or a toothpick over an area taking up around 3/5ths to 3/4ths of the spoon. Now, lightly tap the edges of the spoon so the powder distributes evenly. We want as thin of a layer as possible. With a lighter, begin heating the spoon, distributing the flame evenly under the layer of product. When you start to see vapor rising from the product, you now know it&#039;s time to move the flame a bit away from the spoon to prevent burning. At first, you&#039;ll start to see patches of the powder turn from white to an off-white color. We&#039;re aiming for a light yellow/off-white color-- dark yellow or brown means you&#039;ve heated the product too much. When it&#039;s white and glassy, you&#039;ll know it&#039;s perfect. When a portion of the powder turns the desired color, immediately move the flame from that area to an area that hasn&#039;t yet turn the color. Once everything is a nice yellow color, you can begin to blow on it to try and cool it down, but only if you&#039;re snorting or eating it.<br /><br />Please note that it takes time to perfect the heating portion of this method. If you&#039;re careful and vigilant, you&#039;ll get it on the first time.<br /><br />4 - Preparation of the product<br />Injection - Add 1mL of water to the spoon. If you&#039;ve overheated it, the water will intensely boil and cool the spoon down quite a bit. Now, heat the spoon just a bit more until it boils and then very gently mix in the product. If you use too much pressure, the product will stick to the stirrer and it&#039;s quite hard to remove. Once there&#039;s nothing left on the bottom of the spoon, add a few more mL of water until the total is around 1mL and place a rather large cotton in. With an oral syringe, draw up the solution and place it into another spoon. From there, filter once more with a tighter cotton (a micron-sized filter is highly recommended) and a syringe. Save the cotton, it should have some gel left in it. If the syringe has no visible gel parts floating around, you&#039;re ready to bang.<br /><br />Insufflation - Scrape the spoon with a knife, collecting the oxy, and blow on the product to cool it. It should turn fairly brittle, but not brittle enough to break up with a card. If you have talcum powder, or even another snortable pill to mix with it, mix the powder with the product at an eyeballed 1:1 ratio with a thin metal object on a plate. Then, flatten the resultant product whilst on the plate. If the product doesn&#039;t seem to be sticky, you&#039;re ready to chop and go. If that isn&#039;t the case, place the plate in the freezer for 5 minutes or more. It&#039;ll be ready when you try to break the flattened product and it cracks rather than gives. Crush, snort, and enjoy!<br /><br />Oral - Probably the easiest of all ingestion methods. Simply scrape the product with a knife, blow on it to cool, swallow, and enjoy your IR high! <br /><br />Rectal - Follow through with the injection procedure up to the oral syringe step. After that, place in your favorite administering-device and plug away!

				Rabbit,<br /><br />I just did my first Dilly&#039;s recently.&nbsp; A few years ago I had some back issues where I was taking 50-60 mg of pure oxycodone a day (for about a year) but since then I&#039;ve only had the occasional Vicky and now my tolerance is very low for opiates.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard about the low bioavailibilty of Dilly&#039;s and since I&#039;m not about to IV &#039;em I just let them melt subliminally.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve found is that they give a really nice warm high but it doesn&#039;t last very long (both the hydrocodone and oxycodone high&#039;s seem to last a lot longer for me).&nbsp; I will say that I much prefer the high of the Dilly&#039;s to that of oxycodone.<br /><br />If it were me I&#039;d rather take (either sublingually or snorting) 4-6 mg&#039;s to start with and then take another pill in an hour and then another an hour after that.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a big fan of crazy nods and I prefer to use opiates to improve whatever I&#039;m doing so I&#039;d rather draw out the good times than blow through 12mg and only have it last for an hour or two.<br /><br />Have fun!
