				Title: <strong>Question about heroin dosing</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hey folks, before I begin let me say that I am a veteran heroin user (multiple year, daily habit of around 5 bags per IV shot).&nbsp; However, my situation has changed and I got clean for around a year so I&#039;m quite certain my tolerance should be nowhere near what it used to be.<br /><br />Anyway, I recently ordered a half gram of dope from a pretty well established vendor and I was wondering a few things.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Is purity of dope from Silk Road generally MUCH higher than that of street heroin (from East Coast USA)?<br />2. I have heard heroin tolerance never really reaches zero again even with extended breaks.&nbsp; In your experience is this true?&nbsp; Having never quit and come back to it like many people I never had the luxury of a tolerance break.<br />3. Assuming high purity, what would you suggest as a starting IV dose for someone with about a year break if I want a good rush?<br />4. Also assuming high purity, how far do you think a half gram will go for two people?<br /><br />As a side note: My buddy who is pretty much non-tolerant to all opiates recently got into shooting his drugs and wants to do so with heroin.&nbsp; As is, we&#039;d be shooting it together but he is notorious for being a lightweight so I&#039;m still trying to decide if I dare let him inject this stuff.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br />PR

Also assuming high purity, how far do you think a half gram will go for two people?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It will maybe last you 2-3 days<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As a side note: My buddy who is pretty much non-tolerant to all opiates recently got into shooting his drugs and wants to do so with heroin.&nbsp; As is, we&#039;d be shooting it together but he is notorious for being a lightweight so I&#039;m still trying to decide if I dare let him inject this stuff.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well i would never advise to get any more people into heroin, but if he is sure about it then go for it, but should be really&nbsp; careful with the dosage maybe start with 20-30mg (30-50 mg PURE heroin can already kill a total new opiate user)<br /><br /><br />The purity that vendors offer really varies a lot, so it would probably a good idea to check reviews and feedback of those vendors.<br /><br />Another advice: maybe try smoke (if #3 heroin) or snort (if #4), it gives you a decent look at the quality, and you can easily see how much tolerance you still got, as well its harder to OD<br /><br /><br />take care!<br /><br />bamoida2
