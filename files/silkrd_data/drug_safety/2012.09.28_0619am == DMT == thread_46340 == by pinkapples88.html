				What is this Jungle DMT? I ordered it to try some.Is it the same as &quot;Jungle Spice&quot; because I thought that was dark red.But Elvis has the jungle DMT and said its orange and yellow.I looked it up and couldn&#039;t really find anyone that really knew exactly what the difference between &quot;jungle DMT&quot; yellow/orange and regular white dmt and then &quot;jungle spice&quot; that is sometimes called &quot;red&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; dmt they are all extracted from the same plant I know that and some people said there is a difference in the duration and a difference in how much you need.Also I read several people say that &quot;jungle spice&quot; (the red kind) and the yellow/orange produce a &quot;more scary and intense trip with no breakthrough,no magically beings bringing messages of wisdom,no unknown entities,or fractal patterning, only a change in color and an overwhelming feeling,with an unpleasant body load&quot;. I am going to try it regardless.But I was just wondering if it is so bad then why would people sell it or why would anyone even go out of their way to make the &quot;bad&quot; DMT if they could have just made the normal white DMT that everyone is used to.Does anyone have any info? And if you have tried it please let me know if it was as unpleasant as the people were saying on the forums I found.

				to your question about whether they go out of their way to make the jungle spice, it is actually whats leftover after pulling the majority of the n,n-dmt out <br /><br />this is not an exact term though, and its all dependent on many factors what exactly the composition is.<br /><br />5-meo is common and sounds slightly like whats being described.&nbsp; you can breakthrough but its into a blank space, occasionally with a universal powerful &quot;presence,&quot; and the strong body component like dmt, but NONE of the visual aspects that are so characteristic of the n,n molecule

				Thank you for the info I will ask the vendor for sure if it is 5 meo.If it is he should put it in the 5 meo catagory! I was just looking for something a little bit different than all the usual stuff but no visuals and no break through and no blast offs doesn&#039;t sound that amazing haha.I really hope that its only called jungle dmt but is really just normal dmt with some impurities because I didnt know if jungle dmt and jungle spice are the same.I think it may just be slightly impure dmt or dmt that wasnt extracted carefully because he specifically says that its yellow and some orangish crystals and when I read the descriptions of the jungle spice it says that its dark red almost maroon color and that its more like little balls of wax.Anyway +1 thanks for the info dude!
