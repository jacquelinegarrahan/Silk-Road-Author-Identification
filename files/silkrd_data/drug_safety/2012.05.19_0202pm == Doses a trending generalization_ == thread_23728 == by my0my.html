				Did a festie and got a dose. 8 years ago that was an electric experience L, but his slipped in real smooth. the sky came alive and i&#039;d say most of the trip was a head trip when my eyes were closed it came alive and saw internal fractals. It was on a plain thin blotter. Couldn&#039;t have been L.

				I think any time you&#039;re getting L at a rave scene, your chances of getting legitimate L have gone way down. People don&#039;t want normal acid; rather, they want something that will make them extremely happy and really into the music, which is usually one of my other phenenthylamines.

				Are you asking us to help you identify what drug you took?<br />There&#039;s always a possibility of a difference in dose. 8 years ago, you could have potentially gotten a good hit, and the one you got at the festival was just strong enough to have noticeable effects, but wasn&#039;t so strong that you melted once it hit, especially from a single dose (though YMMV).<br /><br />As far as a &quot;dosing generalization&quot; goes, if you&#039;re dropping LSD daily or every other day, you will still likely experience the effects, but they will be diminished.<br /><br />sdesu
