				I&#039;ve always had a hard time (duh, does anybody NOT have a hard time?) kicking. I&#039;ve only gotten off of heroin by substitution except by being locked up (actually it seems almost easier in jail because (IMO) you know you can&#039;t get it period, and it&#039;s just a matter of waiting, miserably, and as long as someone isn&#039;t hassling you the knowledge of not being able to get anything seems to help) In fact, I stayed away from heroin for years and years just because it was so difficult for me to get off of. <br />I did the methadone thing years ago, and like everybody says, it&#039;s harder to kick than heroin, lowering your dose over months and at the end just being tired ALL the time. <br />I&#039;ve tried to stick to pills, which aren&#039;t hard at all for me to kick, especially if I&#039;m under 10-10 mg. hydrocodone a day. The hardest &#039;kick&#039; was about 2-3 (80 mg) Oxycontin OC (the older crush able ones) and that was painful, but still not nearly as hard (unless memory doesn&#039;t serve me well) as a week or so heroin habit. Before I found out that it wasn&#039;t hard kicking pills (or maybe I just had money, that was probably it) I tried Suboxone (the doctor later changed it to Subutex, this doctor was a gem, too bad that he died years ago in a DUI) The subutex &#039;program&#039; was really easy to follow, it&#039;s half life is so long that you never feel sick if you are a few hours late. It&#039;s lousy for pain, though, because during my subutex use I got a case of shingles that was really painful, and upping the subutex to even double my usual amount didn&#039;t do shit. I didn&#039;t want to contaminate my shingle doctor by telling him I was taking subutex and I just saved my 120 10 mg. hydrocodone for the future. I could take 5 or 6 10 mg. vicodan and not feel shit, absolutely like oatmeal as far as pain relief for the shingles. So eventually I decided to stop the subutex and after the 3 days start taking the Vicodin to help with the withdrawals after that. I had a hard time making it for the first 3 days. The first time, after about 24 hrs, I quit and started back up the subutex, but eventually I made it through the 3 days and the hydro&#039;s started to work. <br />So years pass, and eventually I found the Silk Road. Week after week I&#039;d look at the heroin up there and drool. About a month ago I bought a gram from Supreme Smoke (great service, great product, fast shipping) and I also bought some subutex for when it was time to kick. I spent about $1000 in a month, so I decided to take a opiate vacation (or vacation FROM opiates). I&#039;ve heard that if you are still high on your DOC you can get &#039;precipitated withdrawals&#039;, which are supposed to be agonizing (had a friend go through them, he said it he had had a gun he would have shot himself) if you just take subutex or subuxone. I found several articles you can check out. <br />The first is a study where they tried to get precipitated withdrawals in order to study what did it. <br />CLEARNET WARNING http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2094723/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CLEARNET WARNING<br /><br />The second article is about OWS or COWS, which is about a objective (that&#039;s the intention, anyway) way to measure how badly someone is &#039;kicking&#039;. It stands for Clinical Opiate Withdrawl Syndrome. <br />In order to be safe from precipitated withdrawls you need to have 26 or more points while filling out the OWS. <br />CLEARNET WARNING&nbsp; http://international.drugabuse.gov/educational-opportunities/certificate-programs/methadone-research-web-guide/part-c/question-2-how-op<br /><br />The third article is about taking small doses of subutex, about 1/2 mg. every hour and a half during subutex &#039;induction&#039;. I know my doctor just gave me 1/2 of a 8 mg. subutex and then after 1/2 hour another full tablet, and that was the $300 induction from the doctor. Lately I&#039;ve found that there are big advantages to doing it differently, but these different ways aren&#039;t usual for doctors because they involve several hours of supervision (I didn&#039;t need &#039;supervision&#039; BTW, it&#039;s as simple as falling off a ladder). The idea is to make sure that each previous dose of subutex is going directly onto the opiate receptors in your brain and although it takes longer, you end up with a lower dose of subutex that you take every day. They said a majority of people get &#039;stabilized&#039; at 2 mg. <br />CLEARNET WARNING http://www.drugs.com/forum/featured-drugs/suboxone-subutex-therapy-50887.html<br /><br />So back to my story. Last Wednesday morning, about 4:30 am I woke up in withdrawals (I deliberately didn&#039;t take any heroin the evening before). I had previously taken one of those &#039;film&#039; subuxone 8 mg. doses and cut it in half, using a new razor blade. Don&#039;t try to use scissors, use tweezers to hold the film down to glass or a cutting board and I used a ruler to get it pretty much exactly in half. So I kept cutting (gotta be patient) each dose in half until I got 32 small squares that were about 1/2 mg. And when I woke up I took one and using tweezers (you have to have tweezers, the cutting and placing of the film won&#039;t work if you have &#039;sausage&#039; fingers and are as clumsy as me) I placed the square under my tongue. I went back to sleep and tried to make it about 1-1/2 hrs. for each dose. I noticed that I wasn&#039;t getting any worse-I kinda stayed at the same &#039;withdrawal&#039; point that I woke up at 4:30 at, so it wasn&#039;t bad. I wasn&#039;t counting all that well, but I took over 2-3 mg. total that day. Xanax really helps too. The restless leg syndrome wasn&#039;t too bad, but I&#039;m going to get something for that next time. So the day after that day, I woke up and took about 2 mg of suboxone (1/4 of a 8 mg film). Today is Saturday and that&#039;s all the suboxone that I&#039;ve taken. I&#039;m in a MILD type of withdrawal, not even noticeable right now, and it&#039;s been 35+ hours since my last 2 mg. dose. It appears that I&#039;ve totally avoided any addiction to the suboxone, and the last molecules of suboxone are leaving because I&#039;ve done some fentanyl and it slightly works (wouldn&#039;t have had the endurance to write this otherwise)<br />I plan to get some more heroin in the next day or Monday at latest. <br />I can always go to a methadone clinic around the corner.<br />I&#039;ve also used some kratom that would probably be better &#039;sourced&#039; from ebay than SR. \<br /><br />Comments?<br />I&#039;d like to hear what anybody thinks of this, or is this a way that most people know of to kick almost painlessly? I wasn&#039;t in &#039;pain&#039; at anytime, just restless and sweating for the first two days. I feel that if I had taken another 2 mg. of suboxone the second day that I would have been totally &#039;well&#039; but I didn&#039;t want to get addicted to the suboxone and wanted to stay as low as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
