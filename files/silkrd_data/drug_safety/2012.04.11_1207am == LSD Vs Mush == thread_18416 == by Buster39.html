				I ate acid 1 time about 10 years ago and remember it being fun and mellow. Due to the lack of LSD locally over the years Ive been taking mushrooms. As Ive gotten older and have more shit going on in life the Mushrooms trips seem to be a lot less controllable and seems my emotions are more out of wack. Of course now the silk roadhas let me have access to good cid&nbsp; so IM jsut wondering if anyone can she some light on this.

				You may be getting good enough at tripping mushrooms that your psyche is leading you in a &quot;working&quot; direction instead of a &quot;playing&quot; direction. Perhaps learning some meditation and starting a journal would be helpful in the sense of bringing yourself to a place where you accept you have issues (as we all do) and that you are open to confronting/learning from/resolving them.<br /><br />&nbsp;Regular sober meditation and keeping a journal are two of the most powerful mental habits you can utilize to get MAXIMUM results from your entheogen usage.

As much fun as it is to take shrooms, it&#039;s kinda like telling a joke too many times too quickly. Soon enough you get a little too used to the experience and you may find yourself bored or not really having the same ride you used to. As for Mushies versus LSD, the differences are these little nuances. LSD puts you into more of a stony-headspace where you can more easily zone out and watch the visuals and your thoughts flow like water and evolve. Mushrooms keep ya a little more clear headed and allow you to better focus on what&#039;s going on. I duuno if this makes much sense, but mushrooms feel more &quot; earthy&quot; while LSD carries a more &quot;mechanical&quot; feel to it.
