				And no not the synthetics.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really enjoy smoking. It really leaves my lungs feeling heavy and my throat sore.&nbsp; I&#039;m considering getting:<br /><br />--Honey oil from 420Connections.&nbsp; If I do, can I just light-bulb vape this?&nbsp; How much is 1g Honey Oil in terms of grams of the real McCoy?<br />--Cheeba Chews from NiceDeal.&nbsp; This seems to last the longest, from the one time I tried edibles.&nbsp; I am not sure if tolerance goes up faster.&nbsp; Thinking of Quad dose for value? (I have almost no tolerance) <br />--Angelina&#039;s pops -- Not sure, it seems I can get more punch with the quad dose.<br /><br />What say you guys?

				Use a vaporizer. Not a light bulb. But this for me is not doable. It&#039;s too heavy for my lungs.<br /><br />You can bake cakes from MJ or HASH or make delicious weed-tea. I don&#039;t know how to ship tea and let it stay good otherwise we&#039;d be happy to boil you some delicious weed tea which lasts long, you don&#039;t have to smoke and you need less weed for it. But it requires spices so the costs will be about the same...<br /><br />Best alternative to smoking mj is to not use it at all ofcourse unless you can control yourself and do it occasionally...

				Vaporize it. Do not use a fucking light-bulb. The Magic Flight Box is pretty decent and discreet, I loved mine. Your average box+whip vape does the job quite nicely, but there is a pretty decent learning curve to the technique. If you have plenty of funds, get a volcano vape.<br /><br />Edibles are always an option, but dosage levels can be a bitch to control. The THC is converted by your liver into a much more potent form, and you will likely end up couchlocked as fuck. I simply cannot deal with eating it, it scatters me.

				Vaporize. You can use an E-Cig with hash oil, that works really well. E-Cig&#039;s are cheap and legal. You can get one for around $40 on Amazon. PM me for recommendations. <br /><br />I think this is the best way to go. Its discreet and portable, so you can take it on the go and just tell people its an E-Cig and you&#039;re trying to quit if they ask what it is. You get a really nice buzz from the concentrates.<br />

				You have to buy a dabbing rig. It has a vapor dome that comes off the where the bowl area would be on a tiny water pipe. There is either a quartz or titanium nail that sits inside the dome when you place the dome on top. Then you take a decent size jet torch and heat the nail till it turns red hot. Then place the vapor dome on top. once that is done take a drop of BHO and drip it onto the nail plate. Inhale. It gets you super stoned.

				A torch is used to heat a hot nail up and then the BHO is &quot;dabbed&quot;onto the hot nail and the BHO instantly vaporizes / burns.&nbsp; The &quot;nail&quot; attachment is often a bubbler or a piece that can be put in the slide of a bong.&nbsp; The first &quot;dab&quot; you take is like smoking for your first time all over again.&nbsp; Its a pretty intense way to get a huge amount of THC in your system with a single rip.&nbsp;

Sorry if that was wordy or didn&#039;t make sense, just took a dab myself haha.

				This is too funny.&nbsp; I JUST finished posting this in another thread discussing alternatives to smoking marijuana.&nbsp; I shall paste it here as well:<br /><br />For your THC vaping pleasure, I have some listings you should check out.&nbsp; Vaping produces no carcinogens.&nbsp; Nothing burns therefore there are no harmful byproducts.&nbsp; This is one of the main benefits of the electronic cigarette for tobacco smokers.&nbsp; It cannot be said to be 100% safe (but what can be?), but vaping THC poses very little if any health risk while providing some very beneficial chemicals.&nbsp; The symptom relief one gets from cannabis should not be affected by the route of ingestion, just the onset and duration of the relief.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just getting started or want to take it up a notch, I have some raffles that I just listed for complete kits<br />- Beginner kit: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ef157d994a<br />- Advanced kit: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2c74721bd8<br /><br />If you&#039;ve already gotten started vaping and just need the THC to vape, I have some listings for you as well<br />- Prefilled cartomizer: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1776d7edf0<br />- Dropper bottle of e juice: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ea08ff6621<br /><br />Vaping THC is certainly becoming a more common method of ingestion.&nbsp; It is very customizable and virtually undetectable unless you are in a confined space vaping for an extended period of time using a non-flavored product!

				I&#039;m going to have to agree with everyone else here who suggest using a vaporizer. It&#039;s more clean, smooth, and a more efficient use of your bud.<br /><br />Personally I use the Pax (small discreet portable vape), and I love it. I happen to prefer portable vapes over the tabletop ones, mostly for the stealth and convenience factors. The only downside is it can be a little high-maintenance for some; personally I don&#039;t mind, but you do have to clean it out with iso every few bowls or it won&#039;t work as well (due to resin buildup in the vapor path and the mouthpiece switch mechanism getting gummed up).

				Another thing to consider is tinctures and other exctacts in liquid form. Look up OldHippie&#039;s recipe for green dragon if you&#039;re not familiar with it. It&#039;s super discreet, as you can simply keep it in a little amber glass bottle with an eyedropper, and put a few drops in a tasty drink of your choice. Citrus flavors in particular seem to mask the harsh taste; a tequila sunrise or screwdriver are perfect. Also, about 1-2ml is enough to give most people a really nice, mellow body high for a few hours. You can get some really nice cerebral high effects as well if you use high-quality headies in your recipe.<br /><br />A minor safety disclaimer: don&#039;t use the double-boiler method unless you&#039;re sure you know what you&#039;re doing, and make sure the alcohol fumes are well ventilated away from your stove/heating element. Otherwise, I&#039;d recommend the heatless &quot;slow-and-safe&quot; method.

Not my experience at all, either in flavour or effect, but then I&#039;m currently working on some nasty ass mj - powerful but I don&#039;t like the taste/smell, so I certainly don&#039;t get any plastic cutting through that. As for strength, well... those who have been here for a little while may recall me talking about use of my cheap Chinese box whip, and taking 200-300 tokes off of it in an evening (if it seems hard to believe, it is for me now, too, but that&#039;s what I did). And then I got a Volcano and carried those habits over... lol. I realize I need some fucking discipline because lately I&#039;ve been waking around 4am with the tv on and me ranting and gesticulating at the remote control to kill the fucking thing. It knocks me the shit out. That said, that discipline thing, again. I&#039;m sucking back 3-5 bags by my lonesome. It&#039;s clearly too goddamn much.<br /><br />As for the main topic, yeah, vape away. That said, the vapour produced by the better rigs (Volcano included) is THICK, man, and I find it sometimes irritates my throat and I&#039;ll have a bit of a coughing spell. I just read someone else saying that vapes make their asthma act up. I know it&#039;s vapour and not smoke (and I am operating the thing at vape temps, not burning it) but it is definitely smoke-like I have to say. Though I say that and then try smoking a joint and it&#039;s just this AWFUL BURNING so maybe not that comparable at all.<br /><br />Wish there were more/better edibles on the Road, as I do find that route enjoyable.
