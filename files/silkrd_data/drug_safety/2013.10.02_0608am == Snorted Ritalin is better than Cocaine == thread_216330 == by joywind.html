				Why use cocaine, when snorting ritalin produces a better euphoria and a longer lasting experience? And it is cheaper

				Snorted Ritalin pros and cons<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />- better euphoria than cocaine<br /><br />- lasts longer than cocaine - 3 hours.<br /><br />- Softer on your heart.<br /><br />- The drip is constantly presesnt but it lacks the numbing effect such as the one on coke, but hey its all good coz the euphoria of ritalin is better<br /><br />- Safer than the street drug coke<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Cant really think of a single thing I don&#039;t like about this chem. <br /><br />- I guess the only con is that people call it &quot;kiddy coke&quot;, and if you want to feel like a big tough man, you don&#039;t want to do a drug that is prescribed to hyperactive kids, you want to feel tough and manly, and you can&#039;t feel tough and manly in your own eyes if you are snorting a pill that kids use.

				There is a downside of ritalin.&nbsp; Because of it&#039;s longer half-life for some who have bad anxiety, it may trigger a long and shitty anxiety attack.&nbsp; Much longer than what someone would feel after their last line of coke or the anxiety they would feel right after a line(granted the coke not being total cut up speedy junk)<br /><br />I actually had to stop taking ritalin because as soon as I take it I would have the worse anxiety.&nbsp; Adderall IR&#039;s are better. <br /><br />Either way.&nbsp; Ritalin and Adderall do give a nice and smooth ride of euphoria but coke is all about that gradual rise in euphoria and then suddenly punching you in the face after a line.&nbsp; The euphoria is definitely unique in that&nbsp; makes you feel good you want to chat it up almost like on MDMA and if it is good coke the come down is not bad at all.<br /><br />I guess you could say it&#039;s similar to why people IV certain drugs.&nbsp; For that rush every time?

				A lot of the coke experience seems to be showing off or just getting off on hedonism. If ritalin feels better than coke, but you associate it with high schoolers, you could still opt for the big-boy cocaine.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe me, go to 420chan.org /stim/ boards and see how many people call Adderall &quot;kiddy meth&quot; and tell others to &quot;grow the fuck up and do some coke, faggot.&quot;

				I&#039;ve never snorted Ritalin, but I&#039;ve snorted Vyvanse and was surprised at how &quot;coke like&quot; the high was.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using coke infrequently for the past 20 years. I definitely prefer the coke high due what I perceive as increased euphoria, but I definitely found the snorted Vyvanse made me more focused on getting lots of physical work done.&nbsp; If I have a big project to complete, like cleaning out a garage, I&#039;d choose Vyvanse.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I&#039;m looking for simply pleasure, I&#039;d pick coke.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s option here is wrong - it&#039;s simply personal perception and experience.&nbsp; This is different for everyone.

As I understand it, it is only the D isomer of Amphetamine that is psycho-active, which would mean that D-Amphetamine, and regular D/L Amphetamine should feel more or less the same, accept for the difference in potency (Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong).? Normally I don&#039;t really feel like Coke and Amphetamine can be compared, but I am wondering if the Amino-acid on Vyvanse is what is causing this difference.?

				Definitely a big fan of snorting ritalin and it&#039;s dextro isomer (Focalin). I like using both, the euphoria lasts longer with ritalin than coke, but I don&#039;t have to stop snorting lines 2-4 hours before I want to crash. I&#039;ve had the opportunity to snort coke and ritalin, in separate piles not a mixed powder and it definitely helps keep a decent long term buzz going while on coke. <br /><br />I definitely wouldn&#039;t turn down a line of either personally. They have the same general effect, but both have ups and downs.
