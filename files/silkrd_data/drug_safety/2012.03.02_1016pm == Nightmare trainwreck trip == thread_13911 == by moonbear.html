				Tonight I&#039;m gonna get high as hell and post a trip report. Why? There&#039;s a storm going on outside and all I&#039;ve got is a computer and a ton of drugs. So here&#039;s my trip report. I&#039;ll update it as it goes. EDIT: Why did this get moved to drug safety?<br /><br />0:00 - I won&#039;t start the real high for a few hours but I decided to post my review for bigbill6778s jamaican oil with some vyvanse. The jamaican oil is black, thick and sticky, like tar. It smells fantastic. I started by smoking a pinprick amount. It did nothing. Took a slightly bigger hit. Nothing. Took another. Now I think that it&#039;s resin or something, except that it tasted good and had a consistent texture. So I finally take a normal sized hit and the result? I&#039;m high as fuck. This stuff is perfect for blunts. It could make a blunt really potent and even make it taste better. So now I&#039;m high as fuck. This high is totally unique compared to other weed, probably because it doesn&#039;t have very much of the other cannabinoids in weed since those are filtered out. It&#039;s prefect to potentate weed or for combining with other drugs. I feel stoned but clear-headed. Thanks bigbill, I gotta check the prices for this stuff because if it&#039;s priced well I&#039;ll need to order some.<br /><br />4:00 - IC OXYCODONE - ACETAMINOPHEN 5-325 Swallowed one tab, I&#039;m just smoking this oil and chilling. I was gonna take some psychs but I&#039;m gonna ask around in drug safety first to make sure I don&#039;t end up killing myself.<br /><br />6:00 - 3 Hits of foxymeows 25i-nbome, sublinguinal. 45mg 2c-t-7 in a gel cap. 5mg 2c-t-7 mixed with jamaican oil and smoked. So now the real high will begin. I don&#039;t feel much yet. The nbome blotters are mint-flavored. Kind of tasty. Gotta find out how much is in these, I hope I&#039;m not risking an overdose... The most acid I&#039;ve ever done is about 500 ug. So This may very well be the most intense trip of my life, we shall see... For now I&#039;ll go do research on my safety.<br /><br />6:20 - The visuals are just barely noticeable. My chest feels heavy and a have a tingling sensation going up my spice. I&#039;m paranoid and worry that I may have overdosed. I hope I&#039;m not risking heart failure. I&#039;m in pretty good physical condition but still... <br /><br />6:25 - My throat feels tight, by heart rate is elevated... I feel nauseated. I&#039;m honestly scared. I&#039;m gonna smoke some jamaican oil and try to calm down... The worst part is knowing I&#039;m just coming up and won&#039;t climax for awhile to come...&nbsp; :(<br /><br />6:32 - This is way too intense. I wish I could just like take a step back... well if I die I at least want to be properly high so I better polish off this jamaican oil.<br /><br />6:38 - Well I&#039;m glad the coming up is over. I feel much better now. Oh wait... I&#039;m only half an hour in?! Fuuuuuuck<br /><br />6:55 - I can&#039;t even begin to describe... what the fuck I&#039;ve gotten myself into. I just now thought I accidentally stuck a needle inches below my skin... but I didn&#039;t. And that&#039;s the weirdest thing. You&#039;ll be doing something. Then think. Oh wait. That didn&#039;t happen at all. Then you&#039;ll get caught up in the trips for awhile. <br /><br />17:00 - The visuals finally stopped around this time. I still haven&#039;t been able to sleep and am exhausted. Lesson learned: don&#039;t fuck with large doses of synthetics. I went batshit insane.

				I learned my lesson. While the visuals were more colorful and intense than lsd, I didn&#039;t get any mood lift and got horrible depression. Instead of most of the trip being fun and then a comedown for a few hours, it was just a few hours of fun and then most of the trip was awful. For some reason I thought it would be fun to smoke plastic. I was just tripping so hard. I lit plastic on fire, blew it out, then inhaled the fumes. That whole trip was just horrible. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do any psychs again except lsd, shrooms, and mescaline. The 2c&#039;s are just not for me.... I still shiver when I remember that horrible trip. I hope I never go through anything like that for the rest of my life...

				First and foremost, I attempt to be mindful of my set, setting and drug.<br /><br />I the event I&#039;ve realized I&#039;m having a bad trip, I&#039;ve found that fighting it usually makes it worse or just a struggle in general.&nbsp; The best thing to do is to accept it, remind yourself it&#039;s the drug, it *should* go away eventually. Decide if you need to address these demons or if it&#039;s just some whacked out shit your mind has conjured up and find a way to cope or purposely lose focus / distract yourself.<br /><br />Of course, the best way to avoid these situations in the first place is to be wise with the 3 things I mentioned in my first sentence.&nbsp; Have a sitter if necessary, do your research, be in a comfortable environment, a good mindset, be safe.<br /><br />I can see how being in your parents house, bored, after a month long drug binge, combining and overdosing on RCs, popping pharmies while smoking plastic and feeling tied to your computer could lead to a bad trip.<br /><br />Fuck us all, you&#039;re going into medicine?
