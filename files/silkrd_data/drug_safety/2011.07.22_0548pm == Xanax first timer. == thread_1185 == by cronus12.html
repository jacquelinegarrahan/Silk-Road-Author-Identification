				Does anyone have any pointers, warnings, suggestions that they would give someone thinking of taking an increased dose of Xanax?&nbsp; The prescription is .5mg two times daily but sometimes feel like I could use more.&nbsp; What would the maximum for a single does be?

				In my opinion, xanax addiction is one of the worst addictions that there is. My wife used to be a xanax addict. When you take a lot of them it give you the opposite effect. It gives you energy, almost a meth like high. Then you cant remember doing shit after you take them.<br /><br />Keep your habit small. Also, benzo W/d&nbsp; is not only terrible to go through, it can be deadly. Thats why if you run out and you take it daily you need to go to the ER. Most likely they will give you a script and a tapering schedule....<br /><br />Trust me, my families life got turned upside down due to benzo abuse. Be careful.

				You don&#039;t really need to increase amount you take, try crushing them and sniffing it and you&#039;ll get a faster high. Won&#039;t last as long but will hit you much faster and more intense than swallowing. <br /><br />Addiction to benzos is horrible, but it does seem to take a lot of abuse to get addicted compared to say opiates. I&#039;ve done tons of benzos and had a tolerance but never an addiction, physical or mental.&nbsp; Everyone is different, and from what I was told in rehab you can actually die if you are badly addicted and go through sudden withdrawal. But at .5 you are FAR away from anything bad like that. I was doing 2 2MG bars a day for a few months when I was on methadone and luckily didn&#039;t get a habbit on the xanax. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to enjoy them especially if you have a script. Just be careful about becoming physically dependent on them. Also be careful mixing with alcohol and blacking out, you will get violent and do stupid shit.

				Sniffing and crushing them doesnt help, as the bioavailability is quite high for benzos.<br />If you are prescribed xanax for anxiety disorder and it isnt quite working for you enough talk to your doctor, he will either increase the dosage or change benzo.<br />I eat 4 mg a day right now but next week i&#039;m looking to up it to 6mg a day. I have three anxiety disorders and they can be a quality of life changer in my book, mine increased 98%<br /><br />If you are using for recreation, 3-4mg should be plenty and you should drink heavy on them, 1 or 2 drinks might be ok but it rapidly declines down hill in the destruction you will cause to yourself and others in the state of mind you will be in under the influence of that deadly combination. I suggest no drinking at all on them.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ve been on Benzo (Xanax) for 6 months now, and I never feel the need to take them. They make me sleepy and calm, but besides from that its a waste of time. Weed is my new favorite XD. Xanax W/D is a bitch; colds, shivers, etc. But if you can control taking them once every 2-3 days I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine. I did that for 3-4 months, and now I&#039;m tapering down and substituting with bud.

				Funny how differently these drugs affect us all differently. I have been taking two, .5 mg Xanax a day for the last three days (and I did similar a few years ago.) They only ever too, made me feel calm and sleepy. No high, no stupid shit.&nbsp; But get me on opiates or coke and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn (as they&#039;d say in Friday). Different strokes for different folks I guess.<br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;ve also always been able to put down smoking whenever I feel like it. But I can&#039;t do that with ANYTHING else!<br /><br />WEIRD!

				Oh definitely do not want to become a Benzo addict as I know it is one of the worst addictions to have, but on occasion one may need some extra relaxation for a while if you know what I mean.&nbsp; If I have an RX though and say once a month I decide to take a double dose I can&#039;t see too much harm in it.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that it couldn&#039;t spell trouble for some people, but I have a very non addictive personality.

				I used to be a dealer in real life (not xanax, but I know a LOT, seriously a TON of drug users) so when I set rules for my friends, they listen. One of them is never abuse a drug that you are prescribed. Your doctor gave it to you for a reason (unless you bullshitted, in which case, try to sell or trade for something else). Never abuse a drug you need for its advertised purpose, as you won&#039;t even notice the slide into addiction.<br /><br />If you&#039;re prescribed and still want to abuse, you need to be able to go for several days without it after you abuse, or you&#039;re gonna slip eventually. xanax addiction is TOUGH too.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />on the flip side, if you are not prescribed benzo&#039;s but are going to try some, any advice?&nbsp; I picked up some alprazolam, lorazepam and clonazepam to try (not big numbers).&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on taking everyday to say the least as everything I have read about withdrawals is just plain nasty.&nbsp; I use coke and E every now and then, should I steer clear of these benzo&#039;s when doing these other drugs?&nbsp; I plan on just eating 1 of them at a time and chilling out, but anything to look out for or any other advice?&nbsp; Cheers!<br /><br /><br />J.

Tolerance creeps up on you the more frequently you take it, so the best advice is only to take it when you really feel the need unless your anxiety is severe and affecting you daily. If you do have severe anxiety and you&#039;re taking Xanax, my advice is to move to a longer-half life benzo like Valium, as the potential for tolerance and addiction is not as quick or great as a very short-acting benzo like Xanax.<br /><br />Xanax is the ideal benzo for short-action usage, for example, flight-fright, stage-fright, dental phobia etc.. any situation where you need to block your anxiety without feeling zonked out, and where the drug will wear off fairly quickly without leaving you sleepy. For a benzo-naive person, the normal dose to achieve this affect, would be 0.25mg to 0.5mg. Less is more with Xanax. Start low, and work up. It&#039;s a very potent bonzo and about 10x more potent than Valium dosage wise. 1mg Xanax is equal to 10mg Valium, so if you take 1mg Xanax and you have no tolerance, you&#039;re likely to be in a sudden and deep sleep for 8 hours. Not a good idea if you&#039;re driving or on a dentist chair etc.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;ll come to the problems with Xanax and benzo&#039;s in general.. I have had some experience, but no major withdrawals yet when abstaining. Some people are lucky in that regard, but others experience pure hell withdrawing from benzo&#039;s. What I have experienced is what is commonly called &quot;rebound anxiety&quot; that&#039;s where you feel anxiety much much worse than you normally would, even in normally non-anxiety causing situations (like by yourself at home). Likewise, if you use Xanax for sleep, you can experience &quot;rebound insomnia&quot; where you feel restless and unable to sleep without it. <br /><br />The problem I have found with tolerance is that, sooner or later, if you start using daily, the effect you got from 0.5mg no longer is sufficient to block anxiety and you will need 2mg to achieve the same effect. This is mainly down to the short half-life, and switching to a longer half-life benzo like Valium/Diazepam can lesson the tolerance problem to some degree.. you can take both drugs... because I find Xanax to be superior for anxiety situations, but Valium good for keeping away rebound anxiety. <br /><br />For insomnia, a good alternative is to Etizolam which is a benzo-analogue. It still has the same problems of tolerance and dependency, but far less so than a true benzo. I wouldn&#039;t advise using daily though still, only for severe insomnia, and it&#039;s far too potent to use during the day in my experience for anxiety, it&#039;s definitely a sleep-aid drug, it knocks you out.<br /><br />As always, NEVER mix benzos with alcohol and other drugs, especially heroin or opiates.. else you may never wake up.. so many people have died that way. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s interesting you mention etizolam in this context, as it is not only a decent hypnotic, but also a pretty good anxiolytic for some people. <br /><br />Personally i experience a different response for anxiety between etizolam and alprazolam: Alprazolam is good at completely surpressing anxiety in many cases, but when it fails to do so the anxiety is pretty bad. Etizolam on the other hand doesn&#039;t seem to completely suppress the feelings of anxiety, but limits your reaction to it. Without any medication such anxious moments will produce a very unsettling feeling, with elevated heart rate, palpitations and such. Etizolam seems to reduce those effects to a great degree, while you are still aware of having a panic moment.<br /><br />As this is from personal experience i cannot state that this would be the same for everyone, but it still is interesting. Alprazolam certainly is your friend when you want to avoid anxiety completely, but etizolam might be quite useful when combined with &#039;talk therapy&#039; as you are aware of the anxiety but remain physically functional throughout them. Perhaps this can be a useful tool for those that want to learn to cope with anxiety instead of simply suppressing it.
