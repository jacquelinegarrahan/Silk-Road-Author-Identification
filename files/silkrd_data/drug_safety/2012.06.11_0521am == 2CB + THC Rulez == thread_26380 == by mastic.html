				Yesterday i got finally the time to try the 2C-B Hbr powder coming from GammaGoblin and it was really intense. I am impressed.<br /><br />Just swallow 18mg of powder then it hitted in 30/45min with the famous red/green afterglow patterns. Then all the awareness came in place, felling the music amazing, you can organize each sounds like on lsd, you feel each sound in the space coming from the rear and everywhere. The &#039;textures&#039; are all amazing on 2c-B, sounds, visuals and touch feelings, that&#039;s very nice.<br /><br />I smoked some hash and weed during the trip, maybe 5 joints in a 3 hours lol because the smell is awesome. You can smell the pure taste of the weed and hash on 2c-B, it makes you shiverring of happiness :)<br />When i start smoking i felt the effect directly coming stronger and deeper in my mind, definitly lsd feelings in the sounds and some visual patterns like the particulars moving on some surfaces and the red/green glow :)<br />By the way, Blond pollem from Djabbar and Sour Diesel from FreshTouch are awesome cannabis dope.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t felt a real neurotoxic secondary effects, i had plenty of energy and awareness after the trip, it seems quite clean.<br /><br />I really liked this combo

				How is the thought process/body load on 2C-B? The only 2C I&#039;ve ever tripped on was 10 mg of 2C-I, and it basically left me in an emotionless, body loaded, catatonic state for about four hours. I had absolutely no thoughts during, and after the peak. Only visual I had was a spinning, circular ring of Egyptian symbols that were projected on the wall, but soon vanished after 10 or so minutes. The trip wasn&#039;t bad, but I wouldn&#039;t rate it as a good one either.

				I&#039;ve got some caps coming soon so I&#039;ll try them with a few js and post here or in a thread as well :) excited as a 2C-B is my first &#039;real&#039; psychedelic, and might pick up some 25i blotter soon as well in a week.<br />Is it better to take during the day or during night-time?

You feel like you are only one entity and that you loose your body sometimes. On lsd i feel my body lighter like i can fly when i close my eyes but with 2C-B i didn&#039;t feel it sometimes, that&#039;s fun.
