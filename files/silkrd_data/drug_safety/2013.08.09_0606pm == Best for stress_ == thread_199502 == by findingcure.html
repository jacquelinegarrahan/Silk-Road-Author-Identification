				So the question is there.<br />I made one question topic little while ago about Propranolol, where i got pretty satisfying answers, but decided that i should widen the question. So what do you think what really works for stress or do you already personally favor some poison already&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Every option is on the board.<br /><br />Cannabis is often mentioned as one option, but it would be also good to know the &quot;breed&quot; and type of the cannabis(if you use that).<br />And do you personally feel one session of some drug is enough or does something work better when used daily(not of course all the time, but bit more stressing times)? Naturally extremely stressing times are very tempting for addictions as well, but im sure that with enough responsibility, many drugs can help with this condition.<br /><br />Im not sure, am i really asking this for myself or just out of interest how others manage themselves. As you noticed i mentioned Propranolol, because i personally try to approach the topic from medical perspective, at least as long it is medical problem to me. But everyone is free to tell their own opinions and ideas :).

				Cannabis can work for stress but I think it&#039;s really dependent on what is causing the stress. If it&#039;s just a heavy workload, too many things going on, it can probably help you unwind and lift your mood. But if it&#039;s something like a death in the family, something like that, I think it can almost make that kind of thing worse because the emotions associated with it become even stronger.<br /><br />For cannabis types there&#039;s sativa and indicia primarily, then many hybrids. Sativas tend to elevate mood, make you giggly and feel good, more of a &#039;heady trippy feeling&#039; some say. Indicia dominants are good for relaxing, they have more of a &#039;body load&#039; and make you want to get comfortable somewhere and just veg out.<br /><br />I&#039;d say it would require regular use during the stressful time. There&#039;s not many things you can just take/do one time and go &#039;wow poof my stress/problem is gone&#039;.

And yes, it also depends what causes the stress. In my case it&#039;s &quot;stress that causes stress&quot; aka chronic stress state that prevents relaxation(and symptoms cause more stress by doing so). But there is no need to concentrate only to my problem.

Xanax is now mentioned twice. It&#039;s benzodiazepine. Does any one by the way feel normal on benzodiazepine? I have used once Oxatzepam and it made me feel quite numb, but didn&#039;t remove stress symptoms.

				What do you mean by feel normal? Xanax takes away my symptoms of stress and anxiety at the expense of making me sleepier and a bit more haphazard.

Very interesting. I also have wondered the shut down effect of some drugs. This type of medicines, i guess, just slow down certain brain areas, but doesn&#039;t really help them recover. I guess, i dont know.

				I made a bit leisure research and read that Phenibut has some similarities with GHB. Not sure what but they are often mentioned together. But unlike latter it&#039;s legal.

				this may not work for other people, but back in high school I would get high as FUCK from rubbing my temples. I can still do it now, but do not do it as much. One time I had like 3 hours of sleep and it was late in the afternoon, I went into a stall and rubbed my head with some pencil erasers, for about 10 minutes I was blazed as shit and had energy.
