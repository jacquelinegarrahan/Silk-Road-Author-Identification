				Before I tried any &quot;real&quot; psychedelics I&#039;d smoked tobacco on and off, weed once every few days for a few months, and done about 200mg of molly every 2-3 weeks for a couple months.<br />Then I ordered DOC blotter from ENBOOM.<br /><br />I did 2 tabs, 1 mg each, held buccally for 45 minutes. The trip lasted about 14 hours and I was telling myself I couldn&#039;t let myself fall asleep because I might go insane. Things seemed to come in waves, undulating between positive, warm, good visuals and thoughts all the way to jagged, pointed, discontent in all of my senses. I felt watched, whether by something good or bad I don&#039;t know. At times I was fearful of losing my sanity.<br />I&#039;ll admit I may have fucked it from the beginning. I was watching Alex Jones&#039; &quot;Inside Bohemian Grove&quot; until I got too scared. Then watching a roommate play Arkham City on 360 for a while during which I really &quot;came up&quot; I guess. Started laughing maniacally at things that weren&#039;t that funny. And the game&#039;s green/magenta color palette persisted throughout all of my visuals for the remaining 12 hours or so. And now that I read about HPPD, it fits exactly what I wasn&#039;t quite sure I was experiencing for some days afterwards. The effects like enlarged eyes/undulating faces of people and distorted voices would randomly be triggered, albeit in a milder form.<br /><br />Shitty first experience on psychedelics right? Now I have some 25i-nbome and 5-meo-dmt on the way and I&#039;m curious where I should go from here. Tips for dosages, set/setting, activities to do while under the influence, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

				Most people do not like DOC period so it is probably not a good idea to start your psychedelic experience with something like that. Start with lsd or mushrooms and try to save the dmt till later. that will rape your world if you are not ready for it

I would have a playlist of music you enjoy ready before you start to trip. If you don&#039;t want to do them by yourself, eat some with one or two close friends. Exploring your mind is probably the best thing to do while on psychedelics. :)<br /><br />

				In retrospect, the advice I would want someone to have given me for the introductory trip, would be &quot;take a single tab of LSD&quot;. Benchmark every psychedelic experience off of that.
