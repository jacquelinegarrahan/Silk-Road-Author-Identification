				Hi. Gonna be smoking some Opium. Will be taking it through a straw type pipe and heating it gently on a pin/needle with a hot metal object.<br /><br />How many inhales should i take for my first time ie 2 in 30 mins or&nbsp; 5 in 30 mins? I am unsure<br /><br />What will the effects be like of smoking it?&nbsp; Am i likely to get instantly addicted? I can use coke on and off and not feel addicted to that so i&#039;m hoping that i will just be able to use Opium once in a while and not feel addicted.<br /><br />Thanks

				have you considered eating it first? that tends to be the safer option to allow your body to defend itself if necessary.

Your body will react by vomiting, you will throw-up. So when you eat is, you have the chance to continue vomiting long time the last fluid has left your stomach. Never had a pill from your docter to put up your ass? Lot&#039;s of blood-vessels there. You properly still will vomit, but after a while it is normal to vomit a litle and then go to your nicest dreams. It is worth the trouble. But opium in your stomach and still being vomiting after a hour can give you serious kramps, because you muscles are getting tired but you are not able to stop the vomiting. Although you wont be trowing up anything anymore. You feel feel the musclepain from the longtime vomiting many days after the event. You can do it with very small pieces of opium. Check your pupils. They will get very small even in the dark. Like you are watching right into the sun. If your pupil is like a pinch of a needle you are stoned. A waterpipe or a bong is better. It is not like hashish. Its is wet. Even strait from the fridge it will melt right away through the warmth of your hand. Its is almost pure oil. It will evaporate and hit your throat with 180 degrees Celsius. You will be able to zip boiling water after you inhaled a draw. Boiling water is only 100 degrees Celsius, instead of the 180 the opium is when turned into vapor.<br />My advice<br />Have at least 1,5 or better 2 grams.<br />Use a waterpipe.<br />Use just a little bit opium.<br />Prevent to heat it up twice.<br />Inhale the whole piece till there is no more smoke comming from it and you can still add air into your lungs.<br />Wait a minute and check your pupils from your eyes.<br />Continue smoking until they get very small.<br />Your pupils react in seconds, but the feeling the need to vomit comes a little later.<br />That&#039;s why you should give yourself your body a minute before you start to smoke an other hit.<br />If you have only one gram you can not smoke it with a friend.<br />You both will not feel the feeling.<br />And no you will not get addicted from once or twice smoking it.<br />Just don&#039;t do it every week. Once you start smoking twice a week for a few weeks, you will be addicted.<br />If you smoke two times a moth, you never will get addited. There have to be more then 5 nights or 6 day between evry time you use, otherwise you will be having permanent opiates in your blood. Your body needs to be clean before it can take an other dose of opium.<br />It contains morphine, and that is a very serious drug.<br />Not for adolescents or young adults.<br />Older people with experience and who know responsible ways to use it can use it.<br />It might give you bright idees, at least so you will think.<br />You will discover things where nobody thought of, or so you will think.<br />But there some people who have created the most fantastic things, so it can be trough.<br /><br />Adgar Allan Poe, Hitler and a lot of musicians used morphine and if Sherlock Holmes called for Watson ; &quot;Watson, quick, the needle&quot;was it for most of the times for cocain, but mr Holmes loved morphine too.<br /><br />Do not think you can handle it. If you have used it on Sunday and start the friday already again, you will have a period of 10 days of continius morphine possessing. After 5 day it is out of your system, and then you have to give your body the time to recover from those 5 days. That means 1 time using is 10 days not. @ times a month is O.K. 3 times for experienced responsible people. Every week or weekend is a addicted junky, and it will show. Bills are not getting payed, garden wil start looking like a jungle and before you know it you are in a lot of trouble. If you don&#039;t have a rithem in your live, like work, you can be tricked in to opium. Like a ghost with a spirit that calls for you when you are in mental pain. &quot;&quot;Take me&quot;&quot;, and forget al your troubles and dream, dream...<br />And it works, you will forget. But your problem is not going away, and before you know it you are using not every week, but every 5 or 4 days.<br />That addiction will make the time interval in between shorter and shorter. For years it is possible to use once a day, but after a year or two you will be using at least twice but usualy 3 to 4 times a day. Like nicotine in a cigarette. After every 6 or 8 hours your body will remind you that is time for an other time to score and take an other hit.<br /><br />A lot of info, I have more , but enough for a start so far.<br /><br />Good luck, Wasta

				i tried opium and found it to be too weak to be worth my while. i reccomend buying a small amount of black tar heroin and just smoking that instead, it goes a lot further for your money for a better price. but dont do it often!!

Addiction is based more off of your self control and ability to know when to stop than the drug&#039;s addictiveness. Do you have an addictive personality? If so, stay the fuck away from opiates. If not, be careful and use proper judgement and you&#039;ll be fine.

				You must also be prepared to persevere. I find most people I introduce to opium (that I make myself by the way&nbsp; ;D) are pretty disappointed. They expect some kind of euphoric pleasure rush but in my experience that just doesn&#039;t happen. You do get a rush from a big hit but it&#039;s not exactly pleasant, like a tension in the neck and blurry vision. Opium is best enjoyed in a night-long session as you get deeper and deeper..... With a couple friends and some (lots of) weed and snacks of course<br /><br />I usually just use a lightbulb meth-pipe over a candle to smoke it. It needs to get reasonably hot but you don&#039;t wanna burn it. Also, the stories about it tasting wonderful and exquisite are bogus - it smells and tastes like shit! I cannot stand it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think opium has a serious risk of addiction in most people. I have used it and poppy tea for years once a week or so and have no craving to use it more often. I guess I&#039;m just a stimulants kinda guy!<br /><br />I also much prefer oral opium - the peak effects last much longer and really feel no less intense than smoking. But you must know the dose correctly first, an overdose is not pleasant.
