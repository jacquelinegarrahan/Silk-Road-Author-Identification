				Several days ago I was getting ripped on Xanax and beer, same old stuff I&#039;ve done for years on end from time to time. So guy breaks up an Opana, pretty sure it was a 20mg and we split it. I railed my half, then he railed his, and the next thing I know I&#039;m waking up on a hospital bed with an iv in my arm. All they told me was that I was extremely dehydrated and my blood pressure was awful when I got to the hospital. They sent me home and said they were surprised I woke up. I love Xanax and beer, but I often wind up doing stupid shit while I&#039;m on them. I&#039;ve always heard oxymorphone is like no other pain pill. Wow. What a life.

				haha ok I guess what I said is not entirely true, I did break this once before I joined SR when I was on holiday and had access to a chemist (as in pharmacy) which had every drug under the sun.<br /><br />ask me any question about weed and I can probably answer after 10 years of being in the trade but I didn&#039;t know jack about pills so I just bought 10 boxes of valium and xanax. don&#039;t get what the big deal is about valium bit of a lame drug, xanax is lovely though I have to admit.

				1mg of xanax is equal to 10mg valium. Many OD deaths with cocaine or opiates have xanax involved. it is an insidious drug imo. really fucks with your cns, especially over the long run. really fun to stop ct after being on them for a few years. Had severe body pains for a few months felt like I had been beaten, felt like I was going nutz a time or two also. All good now!! Fuck pharmies!! After 35 years of druggin, I am down to the 3 M&#039;s- Marijuana, and MDMA, dMt not mixed and no closer than 30 days for obvious and not so obvious reasons. Love and Light

				mdma? DMT? What did you say about xanax affecting the CNS after long use? and yes benzo withdrawal is the worst, it pisses on heroin withdrawal.<br /><br />and dont get me started on your 1mg xanax is equal to 10 mg of val....that chart may be accurate but the drugs affect you differently because the drugs are different i hope you dont feel indifferent about our indifference if you do please dont. if you dont then dont do..<br />

I had been clean of all pharms and/or alcohol for 1 1/2 years PRIOR to&nbsp; experiencing DMT. Game over, life changer brother. One of the most important experiences of my life

				I am glad you are still alive. Your friend should use more caution and responsibility if hes going to offer extremely dangerous drugs to someone who has already consumed pontentiators as well as a contradiction for oxymorphone use, alcohol.<br /><br />This is a very good example of why you should be extremely careful with opana. It is so potent it should never be mixed with anything if you are not tolerant, especially not alcohol! Your friend needs to realize alcohol drastically can alter the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of opana, and often results in overdose situations. <br /><br />Please I hope you have learned from this if you are going to consume any drug you need to fully understand the overall mechanism and risks involved.

				@ROU, youd be suprised how many people actually msg wanting a sample. One even sent an unencrypted address&nbsp; :o<br /><br />its there for my own humor, but I actually have access to MPTP so the point is very real. people should take ten seconds to look up the crazy letter combination theyre about to ingest<br /><br />fortunately I love my fellow man even if they dont use those fascinating electrical generators in their head.

				yeah, as a general rule mixing multiple cns depressants is generally not a good idea, especially stronger ones, youd likely be ok with say a few beers, a few valium and a bit of codeine (im not saying its a good idea but it probably wont kill you) but the more powerful stuff really isnt to be messed around with. so the moral of the story here is simply know what youre getting into before you do it.<br /><br />@microRNA you may well have the best sig ive ever seen!

				I&#039;ve only done xanax a handful of times, never did I have a lack of memory for what I was doing until my last time doing it.&nbsp; However the last time I did it I didn&#039;t wake up on the hospital bed, I woke up on my couch.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never slept on my couch.&nbsp; Thus, ended my xanax days.&nbsp; 8) Too dangerous for moi.

				Oxy Morphone is the craziest Pharmy Ive ever done. It makes you straight retarded. I puked like 15 times in a row on it tho. but I had hardly done opiates prior to doing it. But crazy man. Crazy. Atleast you&#039;re doing good now.
