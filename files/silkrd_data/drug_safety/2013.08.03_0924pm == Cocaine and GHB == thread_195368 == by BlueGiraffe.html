				Title: <strong>Cocaine and GHB</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>BlueGiraffe</strong> on <strong>August 03, 2013, 09:24 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m starting this thread to explore the combination of Cocaine and GHB use and to gather feedback from those who use this particular cocktail.<br /><br />Personally I am a very occasional and incidental coke user, but my partner in crime (and BlueGiraffe&#039;s very excellent chemist) is a bit of a coke aficionado.<br /><br />His (and my own limited) experience&nbsp; of using coke and GHB together is that it is one of the nicest fucking highs possible! And is a sexual drug combo par excellence. (And to be clear: I am talking only about high-grade pure powder GHB here - not the high liquid weirdness that sometimes floats around under the GHB name.)<br /><br />Without getting into the detailed neural pharmacology of what is going on when GHB and Cocaine inhabit the same body and nervous system (I will in a later post), suffice to say that they complement each other perfectly!<br /><br />As more people are familiar with coke than with GHB, I&#039;ll describe it from the perspective of how GHB modifies the coke experience rather than the other way around.<br /><br />Blood flow!! Coke is a very powerful systemic vasoconstrictor (reduces blood flow). This is one of the reasons for one of coke&#039;s more irritating occasional side-effects - which is not enough wood! GHB is a very power systemic vasodilator (increases blood flow). Apart from the obvious enhancement to both sexual function and sexual pleasure, it also protects the major organs (such as the heart and liver) from reduced blood flow in response to coke&#039;s vasoconstricting qualities. So it serves a health protective function additionally.<br /><br />Much smoother... GHB adds a smooth velvety, liquid dimension to Cocaine. Excellent pure flake / fishscale coke is already smooth (if you don&#039;t do too much) but GHB smoothes it out even further, softens any rough edges (of a tactile and emotional kind). It deepens the breathing, opens the emotional body and physical fascia and allows the coke to flow and penetrate more, and in fact strengthens the coke high by allowing it to go deeper. It also allows&nbsp; more of a relational empathy - so your straight friends will handle your all-victorious take-no-prisoners vibe better 8) you&#039;ll be more in tune with the emotional subtleties of the the opposite sex, and you&#039;ll be able to carry it all off with more naturally integrated capacity.<br /><br />Raw pleasure: The euphoria level is just up. Way up! It&#039;s that basic... Post Cocaine effects are also milder - less edge, easier sleep, and a lighter and more positive emotional state. Just fucking nicer in every way. Oh and did I mention... and more uninhibited, hotter, juicier and altogether raunchier sex tends to be the order of the day ;)<br /><br />In terms of application it seems the ideal protocol is a little coke, then a little GHB (just a dash), then a little coke, then a little GHB etc. (GHB dosing guidelines here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.msg717324;topicseen#msg717324)<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s my basic experience and I really wanted to share that because it seems that all the people who I know who are doing coke and GHB and secretly loving it are not really speaking about it that much - so I wanted to change that.<br /><br />Any further comments from the hedonistic army?<br /><br />BG

				Cocaine + GHB is the da bomb combo !!!! <br /><br />2 lines of really good cocaine... then wait till it hits you, then take a small cap of GHB, wait 30 min to 45 min see how you feel....&nbsp; if its great coke and great ghb you should be feeling real fucking good..&nbsp; but i would make sure not to do more than 3 caps of G in a 3 hour period

				I hate to display my ignorance, but I don&#039;t even know what GHB is or what it does. I am quite familiar with the cocaine end of things. I&#039;ll just hang around here and hopefully learn something new and pleasurable. What&#039;s the downside of the C/GHB combo? Like an earlier poster, I&#039;d hate to fuck up the C buzz.

				Along the same lines (hehe, I&#039;m punny, aren&#039;t I?), I would go as far as to say that 3-MMC and GHB is also a wonderful combo :D<br />Sigh, so lovely. :)
