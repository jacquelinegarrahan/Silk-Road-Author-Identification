				I just got a refill on my Lortab 10s and have been reading about CWE.&nbsp; I crushed up four pills and pour some water I had chilled in the freezer.&nbsp; Let the APAP setting to the bottom and chugged everything except the powder at the bottom.&nbsp; It seems there&#039;s many different (and extravagant) ways to do it but I&#039;m buzzing pretty good.&nbsp; Does anyone have a better way or am I doing it right?

				I would probably filter it through a coffee filter. That way you won&#039;t lose as much hydro...

				@ Chronic you got it.<br /><br />in addition to that you might want to wet the coffee filter a bit, freeze it, and when ready for your CWE, utilize it. This can help unbinding a bit from the APAP. It also reduces the risk of a torn filter (oops!)<br />also, very fine grade cloth works great too....t-shirt etc. just make sure it&#039;s not dyed :P

				I always used cheescloth.&nbsp; They sell it at every grocery.&nbsp; Usually as a kind of cleaning cloth.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can wash and reuse it.&nbsp; Lasts forever.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />And with cheesecloth or a t-shirt section, you don&#039;t have to worry about tearing.&nbsp;

				If you are doing more than say a 1500-2000mg+ of APAP you might want to double filter, because the first pass doesn&#039;t get it all out. :D

Coffee filters have been a pain in the ass, a single drip every few seconds. I even tried the cone shaped filters...<br /><br />I&#039;m confused as to whats the best amount of water to be used per 10 pills. Sometimes I use 10, some times 12, and on a rough day I&#039;ve even used 14. I have a high tolerance. Some people say use no more than 50ml others say you have to use 150ml....any clarification here? <br /><br />Also I&#039;m using yellow 10mg hydrocodone norco (watsons or vicodins), so the solution is always going to come out yellow, but the goal is to have a clear yellow liquid and not cloudy.<br /><br />I am currently adding about 100ml of hot water to the crushed pills in a mason jar, shaking vigorously for a few mins and then let it cool down before I place the jar in a bowl of ice and some water which I sit in the fridge for about an hour until all the APAP solidifies at the bottom.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m fucking up somewhere because I&#039;m not getting nearly the effect if I just chew them up and eat them but I take 10-15 norco 10&#039;s a day and I can&#039;t keep putting my liver through that much hell...

				I&#039;ve done this extraction a couple times. Its best to just buy your stuff without APAP in it, then you dont have to mess around with the procedure. Over time APAP can build up in your liver and do some serious irreparable damage!
