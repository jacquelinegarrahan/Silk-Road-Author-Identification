				I don&#039;t usually ask many questions here, but I&#039;m frustrated &amp; confused about why the Amphetamine I had isn&#039;t working properly.<br />I had a 1mg xanax about 24 hours ago (I have no benzo tolerance) and I have a couple of grams of BoyMasters Amphetamine (for those who don&#039;t know, BoyMaster produces very pure speed).<br />I have a pretty low tolerance to amphetamine and I started off with snorting 40mg. Felt the heart going faster and very mild euphoria after about 5-10 minutes, but nowhere near as strong as it should be. Waited a while... Still nothing. So I had another ~40mg. I felt that come on and a bit of mild euphoria and the awakening feeling got stronger, but seemed to drop off a bit fairly quickly. Had yet another ~40mg line and it strengthened the effects a bit more. But still nothing like 120mg of this speed should feel like. Normally 50mg&#039;s gets me off more than I currently am.<br /><br />Could the xanax I took 24 hours ago be blocking the effects? I know xanax will kill amphetamine effects, but is 24 hours normal?<br />Normally when I have speed I am awake for 7+ hours after I take it. But it&#039;s been 2 hours and I don&#039;t feel full of energy and alert like I usually do.<br />And now I&#039;m in a bad mood because I was looking forward to my speed session :-(

				The half life of Xanax is around 11 hours and that&#039;s not a big dose so I would have thought its not that. How do you know its good speed and what effects are you looking for? Speed just keeps me awake I never get a rush off of it.

I&#039;ll wonder what it was / where it came from, etc.<br /><br />Weed makes me more paranoid than anything else, and hash is even worse.
