				So, i smoked a tiny amount of crystal yesterday, came down, went to sleep. But i can still feel my body detoxing the chemicals out.<br />Well, i&#039;d like to take a 10mg addie , and do a little bit of work on the comp, but i dont wanna be adding more amphetamines to my system, if its going to mess with the detoxing crystal in my system...<br /><br />So basically...if i take adderall, am i gonna be all good? will i have any adverse health issues to worry about?

				I don&#039;t think so. 10MG Adderall is a drop in the bucket I think they call that the homework dose. The other night I took 4 x 25MG XR I took them within a 4 hour period the come down was terrible I won&#039;t make that mistake again. <br /><br />

				10mg of Adderall isn&#039;t much to be worried about.<br /><br />In regards to the detoxing, yes - adding additional amphetamines will increase the overall amphetamine concentration in your blood (though, depending on when you smoked the meth, the serum concentration may be low enough to where there isn&#039;t much of a difference).<br /><br />In regards to health issues, you should be fine. However,&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend that you stop smoking meth completely, it&#039;s basically poison. Don&#039;t be surprised if you end up having liver and/or renal damage, whether it&#039;s acute or from chronic use. <br /><br /><br />sdesu

				I concur with the others - you should be fine.<br /><br />As for long term usage, stop smoking ASAP... instant damage.

				Yea, completely understandable. I had the same view of crystal meth, and crank, and any illegal street speed for quite a long time, but friends and even a few family members started using, little by little, and it eventually made its way into my life. <br /><br />As for adderall, i do have a mild form of ADHD, so those legitimately help me, But the Crystal, that is just for fun. <br /><br />Oh, and taking that adderall helped me out tonight aswell, my body is detoxing the crystal, and the amph from the Addie&#039;s totally eased up the stress and the ick nasty feeling i felt all throughout my body @.@ <br /><br />
