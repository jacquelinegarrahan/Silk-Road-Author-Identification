				Hello. I&#039;ve done my share of drugs, but MDMA isn&#039;t one of them. I&#039;ve done xtc. I&#039;ve heard the two are similar, but what are the differences? Is it better to insufflate, smoke or what?

				MDMA is XTC. XTC is usually sold as &quot;mints&quot;... and mdma is the active ingredient. :) <br /><br />For the ROA, I like to snort my molly (MDMA).

				Pure mdma hmm you could call it pure heaven. Ur a lucky fella. <br /><br />Smoking is almost worthless. But&nbsp; I personanlly love to snort it but don&#039;t recomend it. Burns something awful and taste so horrible I puked my first time.<br /><br />What I would recomend is getting about 100-150mg and bombing it. (Swallowing it Like a joint paper or toilite paper). I normally just use jell capsules because I have hundreds around the house from doing that with 2cb.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; recommend exceeding 200mg total as it will greatly increase side effects. But a redose up to that when you peak and start to level off is always a way to keep your roll strong<br /><br />Also on another note be safe mdma is neurotoxic. Before you roll go to a supplement store and grab some 5-htp. Take those the couple of days after you roll not before. It will replinish your seritonin and help with the next couple of days. But in my experience until you get in the 300mg range you won&#039;t feel to bad.&nbsp; Dont do it more than once a month. Or atleast 2 weeks. Its awsome at a club or just with a partner. Have fun!<br /><br />

				Should have said this in my last post. Duration for bombing is 6hours with the peak2-3<br /><br />Snorting is about 2-3hours with peak about 45mins-1.5hours<br /><br />I fergot to mention disolving it. It is a pretty quick onset compared to bombing but still about 30 mins. Seems to be a good in between for me. Oj is great but if you can handle awful chemical taste water will work fine. If its pure mdma is should disolve really easy with just maby one stir.

				I feel like dissolving the pill / powder in water decreases the come up time by about 10-15 mins. <br /><br />Just put it in a shot glass and down it is what I do, there&#039;s no good tasting way of going about it really

				Of course it all depends on who you know and what area you&#039;re buying in, but sometimes things sold as &quot;XTC&quot; aren&#039;t even MDMA at all - it can be a whole long list of different chemicals. I spent years buying random pills that were often more straight up speed than actual MDMA, and when I tried the real stuff I was absolutely floored. Just letting you know you may be in for a lovely surprise :)

				Who did you win the MDMA from ^.^? I have found some of the whiter MDMA to make me nauseous, while the brown large crystal chunks of MDMA gives excellent rolls, even up to 200-240mg first time. Some people might consider this amount overwhelming, but it&#039;s more like an overwhelming blanket of excellent heaven, a sea of ecstasy that you can just relax and float away in. On the come down of such a dose you start having more energy and just want to talk and socialize and have fun. <br /><br />My philosophy is, if you think you&#039;re taking to small of a dose, don&#039;t be afraid to take a little bit more... I would rather have an awesome loaded experience than a halfway experience that didn&#039;t satisfy me all the way. Though if the molly is good as little as 150mg will do you fine.<br /><br />Miss

				I think a good 100mg dose will do you for a good starter. the come up is intense and may make you a bit anxious but doesn&#039;t last long, you&#039;ll be feeling very very good!

				Go hard your first time, 1mg per every pound you weigh, trust me.<br />Your first roll is always your strongest and generally your best, don&#039;t waste it. Your first roll will probably last longer than average as well.<br /><br />Make sure you fast and are in a comfortable environment. Rolling is a lot more fun if your with at least one other person. MDMA is a social drug, meant to be enjoyed with others. I suggest a lover or close friend/family member if possible. Make sure they are someone you are very close with and can be VERY honest with, as there is some possibility that you may delve into your psyche and wind up saying things that your always held close or deep inside yourself.<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort it, it&#039;s a waste of the drug, it wares off to fast, is too stimmy, less empathic and somewhat painful, not a smart idea.<br /><br />You should fast the day of and not consume any breads or heavy foods as this will lessen the effects. Also, you will want to buy some 5-HTP for the day after as you will feel quite emotionally and physically tired, 5-htp helps your body replenish serotonin faster and will make this downtime less intense and shorter.<br /><br />I promise you, follow this advice and it will be one of the best experiences of your life

Potency of MDMA varies greatly and I have been doing it for over ten years, however 200 mgs of excellent product has been known to have me throwing up and rolling so hard I couldn&#039;t fucking see anything and barely walk, not a great experience for someone who has never tried it before. Start small, 100 mgs and see how it goes. It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t do it again with a higher dosage once you know more about what to expect.

				My first roll was a white speaker, tested at around 190-210 of MDMA, I only weighed around 130lb at the time and it was fine, I loved it.<br />Just be sure you are dealing with pure MDMA, it would suck to overdose on meth or some other additive.

				Thanks everyone for the advice. I think i&#039;ll start off with 100 mg&#039;s. Don&#039;t have a scale, but i got a good eye. Btw, i&#039;m not 14 years old as my thread may sound. Just don&#039;t wanna roll hard. I&#039;ve heard it can be quite therapeutic. I&#039;ve read that some therapists will take a small dose, so that they can be more empathetic and objective in listening to some of their patients. Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true or not, i mean you can&#039;t believe everything you read off the internet right? Thanks everyone for the great advice.<br /><br />&nbsp;Won it off of you MissNatural! Thanks for the lottery! And thanks for the great communication in the pm&#039;s we&#039;ve had. I haven&#039;t tried your product yet, but based on communications alone i&#039;ll say you are a very good vendor. Anyway&#039;s thanks to everyone again for the advice, and to MissNatural thanks for the lottery! This is the first raffle, drawing, lottery, etc. I&#039;ve ever won! Lol Hell, the most i&#039;ve ever won even off of a scratch off lottery ticket is the same amount that i paid for it! Lmao. Needless to say, i was surprised to hear that I had won and looking forward to this great experience soon! Thanks.

				I only throw up on bad/dirty MDMA... a lot of the white/washed stuff makes me vomit, though the nice big brown crystally MDMA I can take up to 200-300mg, roll my brainsss out, and have absolutely no nausea.&nbsp; 150 or less of the lesser quality stuff always has me sick.<br />
