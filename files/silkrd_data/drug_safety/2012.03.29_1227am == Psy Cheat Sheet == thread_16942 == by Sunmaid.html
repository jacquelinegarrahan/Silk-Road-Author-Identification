			<dd class="postbody">
				Began compiling this doc as an easy cheat sheet when hunting for new shit and comparing price/dose for the rc&#039;s I see listed here. <br />Has name of chemical, amount per dose, effects. <br />Not complete by any means, thought it&#039;d be useful to some people here and if anyone wanted to help finish with new/incomplete listings and review the accuracy. <br />All the info&#039;s paraphrased &amp; plagiarized from the net.<br /><br /><br />25i-NBOMe<br />Oral Dosage<br />Common: .5-2mg<br />Strong: 3-4mg<br /><br />Duration<br />Total: 5-8 hr<br />Comeup: 1 hr<br />Plataeu: Slowly tapers off<br /><br />Tips on oral: Not orally active. Hold tab in mouth for 30-45 minutes and do not swallow saliva. Alternatively, wet tab with a drop or two of water and place inside nose.<br /><br />Notes: Puts you in great mood, very euphoric, strong visuals, easy to control, comparable to LSD. Possibly quickly builds tolerance that takes long to lose.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />25c-NBOMe<br />Oral Dosage<br />Common:<br />Strong:<br /><br />Duration<br />Total: 5 hr<br />Comeup: 15 minutes<br />Plataeu: Quickly tapers off<br /><br />Tips on oral: Not orally active. Hold tab in mouth for 30-45 minutes and do not swallow saliva. Alternatively, wet tab with a drop or two of water and place inside nose.<br /><br />Notes: Very strong visuals, quick comeup and quickly tapers off in relation to 25i-NBOMe. Cool colors. Possibly quickly builds tolerance that takes long to lose.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />5-MEO-DMT <br />Dosage<br />Smoked<br />Light: 2-5mg<br />Common: 10mg<br />Strong: 10-20mg<br /><br />Notes: Basically comparable to DMT.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />5-MeO-DIPT<br />Dosage<br />Oral<br />Light: 5-10 mg<br />Common: 8-15mg<br />Strong: 15-30 mg <br /><br />Duration<br />Total: 6-8hr<br />Comeup: 10-60 min<br />Plateau: 2-5 hr<br />Comdown: 3-5 hr<br /><br />Effects: distinct changes in perceptive quality. reported &#039;sharpness&#039; to objects, light and color. Significant social lubricant, though not inherently sexual. Unimpressive as a psychedelic, effective as a recreational facilitator.<br />Physical effects: marked rise in body temperature, met with perspiration. mild nausea, more than likely the result of excessively bitter. minor pupil dilation. waves of wild discomfort, intermittent with waves of extreme physical warmth and comfort.<br />Notes: Though not personally enjoyed as a lone recreational substance, some users recommend an experience with 5-MeO-DIPT, if nothing more than to understand with greater depth, the complexities of the Tryptamine family, and its treasured inhabitants <br /><br />-----<br /><br />5-MeO-MIPT<br />Oral Dosage<br />4–6 mg<br />Smoked Dosage<br />12–20 mg<br /><br /><br />4-HO-MET was LSDesque but totally different body load and level of stimulation. <br /><br />------<br /><br />2c-e<br />Oral Dosage<br />Light: 5 - 10 mg<br />Common: 10 - 15 mg<br />Strong: 15 - 30 mg<br />Heavy: 25 - 40 mg<br /><br />Insufflated Dosage<br />Light- 1 - 3 mg<br />Common- 3 - 7 mg<br />Strong- 6 - 10 mg<br />Heavy- 10+ mg<br />*Tips/warnings for insufflation: When 2ce is insufflated, it usually bypasses most of the nausea caused by taking it orally. but let me warn you; it burns really badly. Make sure you have a milligram scale and don&#039;t ever try to eye out your dose if you don&#039;t know what average dose looks like. Do not exceed 10mg at once if it is your first time.<br /><br />Duration<br />Total Duration: 4 - 9 hrs<br />Onset: 20 - 90 mins<br />Come Up: 15 - 30 mins<br />Plateau: 3 - 7 hrs<br />Coming Down: 1 - 2 hrs<br />After Effects: 2 - 4 hrs<br /><br />Notes: Takes the longest to kick in, lasts longer, has cooler and more interesting visuals, and has stronger mental effects (relative to 2c-i &amp; 2c-c). 2c-e has the potential to cause truly profound thoughts and insight on yourself. I find the mental effects to be stronger and than those of 2c-i and 2c-c, not to mention much more meaningful. I have also found the visuals of 2ce to be much cooler and more intriguing.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />2c-i<br />Oral Dosage<br />Light: 5 - 15 mg<br />Common: 10 - 25 mg<br />Strong: 20 - 30 mg<br /><br />Insufflated Doage<br />Light- 1 - 2 mg<br />Common- 2 - 6 mg<br />Strong- 5 - 9 mg<br />Heavy- 9+ mg<br />**Tips/warnings for insufflation: Insufflation burns horribly but removes most of the nausea from oral.<br /><br />Duration<br />Total Duration: 5 - 8 hrs<br />Onset: 45 - 75 mins<br />Come-Up: 15 - 30 mins<br />Plateau: 3 - 6hrs<br />Coming Down: 1 - 2 hrs<br />After Effects: 1 - 3 hrs<br /><br />Notes: It takes effect somewhat quicker than 2c-e and doesn&#039;t seem to last as long, while it takes longer to kick in and lasts longer than 2c-c. Compared to 2c-e, 2c-i seems to have more colorful visuals, more of a kaleidoscopic effect, a stronger euphoric effect, a more pleasant body effect, and not to mention a way more comfortable come up with nearly no nausea. On the other hand, 2c-i has weaker and less profound mental effects compared to those of 2c-e.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />2c-c<br />Oral Dosage<br />Light: 15 - 25 mg<br />Common: 25 - 35 mg<br />Strong: 35 - 55 mg<br /><br />**Tips/warnings for insufflation: Insufflation burns horribly but removes most of the nausea from oral.<br />-Total Duration: 3 - 5 hours<br /><br />My thoughts on 2c-c: I have only experimented with 2c-c one time, at a dose of 30mg. It didn&#039;t last as long as 2c-i/e,and it didn&#039;t kick in much faster. It had a more relaxing, almost sedating effect to it. But It was definitely weaker, mentally and visually. Not to mention the fact that it is the weakest per milligram (a strong dose of 2c-c being 35 - 55 mg, while 2ci is only 20 - 30 mg). I might need more experience with it, but id pick 2ci/e over it any day. All in all, 2c-c is still a fun and interesting chemical. <br /><br />2C-I + 2C-C ; I am seeking sites that sell both so I can ever experience that total ecstasy, best trip with best visuals ever -&gt; feels good man. <br />20mg of 2c-B and 25mg of 2c-E will blow your fucking face off.<br />LSD and 2C-B is another extremely potent cocktail. It was the most colorful, carnival like experience I have ever had.<br /><br />If possible, get like a measuring cup, spoon, or something and dissolve the powder in water there. 1ml of water for 1mg of 2ce, though i&#039;ve found some compounds don&#039;t dissolve exactly at the 1:1 ratio so a little extra water doesn&#039;t hurt. I use a syringe with the needle missing and suck it up there and then squirt it in the anus, laying face down or on my side and hold that position for a few minutes. About 1.5-2x stronger dose.<br /><br />------<br /><br />2c-b<br />Lower doses (5-15mg)<br />higher doses (15-30mg <br /><br />------<br /><br />AMT<br /><br />Oral Dosages<br />Threshold 5 - 15 mg<br />Light 10 - 25 mg<br />Common 20 - 40 mg<br />Strong 30 - 60 mg<br />Heavy 60 - 80 mg<br /><br />Onset : 30 - 120 minutes<br />Peak : 3 - 5 hours<br />Duration : 10 - 14 hours<br />Normal After Effects : 1 - 5 hours<br />Tip: Can take over 2 hours to kick in, don&#039;t redose too early.<br /><br />Smoked<br />Threshold 2 mg<br />Light 4 - 5 mg<br />Common 6 - 10 mg<br />Strong 10 - 20 mg<br /><br />Onset : 10 seconds - 30 minutes<br />Duration : 8 - 12 hours <br /><br />Notes: Alpha-methyl Tryptamine is a long lasting tryptamine most similar in nature perhaps to LSD. For some people, the effects come on quickly, and for others quite slowly. Many people experience nausea and vomiting with AMT. <br /><br />------<br />Unlisted:<br />2c-p, 2c-t-2, 2c-t-4, 2c-t-7, 25D-NBOMe, DOC, DOB, DOI, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-DET, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MIPT, 5-MeO-DiPT<br />LSD, Shrooms, DMT, Mesc, TMA-2, TMA-6, <br /><br />Incomplete:<br />2c-B, 2c-c, AMT, 5-MEO-MIPT
