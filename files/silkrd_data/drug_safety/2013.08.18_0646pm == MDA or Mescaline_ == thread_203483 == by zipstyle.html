				Currently, I am faced with a dilemma. I am ordering 500mg 5-meo-mipt and thinking about getting 1g MDA or 1g Mescaline, but I&#039;m somewhat undecided. It&#039;s not to say that they are substitutes for one another, but I am torn between which one I should pick. So my question is this: what are good uses for each one and where do they differ? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Mescaline will be more visual, and much more natural feeling<br />to it and loonger lasting. And is very rare too come by, grab that<br />mescaline while you can. Mda you can always buy later on.<br /><br /><br />--<br />Mr.T

				I also vote for mescaline.<br />It is kind of special and not only because it is so fucking rare.<br />Like mrt said-you can always get some mda, but mescaline...oh boy

				MDA is rare and expensive, as it mescaline. But if you&#039;re looking for a more euphoric party drug, go with MDA. If you&#039;re looking to connect with everything on a whole new level go with mescaline.

				Ive taken MDA and never actually hallucinated on it which is very strange. Most likely cause I did psychedelics the day before though.<br /><br />But my buddy did MDA last friday, the first thing I heard come out of his mouth when it started to kick in was &quot;Holy fuck dude, do you see that fucking monkey DJing in the tree?&quot;. I later found out he was also seeing triangular flowers in the grass, which upon blinking, turned into silver cats which were staring and meowing at him.<br /><br />Ahahaha, both are fun as shit. Mescaline feels more natural though and there&#039;s a certain peace of mind knowing you aren&#039;t fucking with your brain and burning out receptors&nbsp; 8) And that the hallucinations and euphoria youre experiencing are all natural and are in no way bad for your physical health

				MDA has quickly become one of my favorite social drugs, hands down. Although it&#039;s easy to &quot;get out of hand&quot; on the stuff, it&#039;s so much fun as a party drug. I&#039;ll take it over MDMA in that sense any day. Love it, love it, love it! Great for sexy times too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not done mescaline but this is now highest on my to do list. The more I read about it, the less I fear it, the more beautiful and profound it sounds. Psychedelic phenethylamines thus far have been nothing but kind to me I&#039;ve discovered, after tryptamines seem to have turned their back on me, or at least my state of mind over the past few years and I&#039;m thankful that SR has made their exploration possible. I&#039;m choosing to postpone it for an undecided special set and setting for the future but I can&#039;t wait for the opportunity to explore grand daddy mescaline sometime in the future. <br /><br />Historically, I can&#039;t recall a time when the two options were available at the same time from quality vendors as they currently are. I see the dilemna. <br /><br />I tried Dr.MDA&#039;s MDA recently and enjoyed it very much (same with 3Janes not long ago). His is brown MDA is to LL&#039;s brown sand MDMA, as 3Janes&nbsp; white MDA is to white dutch crystal MDMA, imo. Sort of a &quot;full spectrum&quot;, if you will. Both awesome and subtly distinct. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve had enough MDMA to appreciate the subtle differences I&#039;m refering to (which are difficult to express). <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d love to hear your report on mescaline, and with summer drawing to a close that would be my choice if a desireable set/setting were also on the horizon.<br /><br />edit: I&#039;ve become interested in 5-meo-mipt too as of late. I look forward to seeing what you have to say about later on.

				Nothing to fear about mescaline if you don&#039;t take too much, it&#039;s a very gentle trip but very powerful at the same time.&nbsp; Kind of like DMT, less like mushrooms or lsd.&nbsp; I found myself with far less anxiety, more empathy and connection to myself and the universe.&nbsp; This was years ago.<br /><br />Is the mescaline on the road good or real?&nbsp; I see this &#039;Synthetic mescaline&#039; stuff and I recall that&#039;s what people used to sell 2c-* as to people before RCs really became popular.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want a RC, I was the real stuff, extracted from peyote.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a vendor for it?

				I did an extract from San Pedro a few years ago.<br /><br />I did it on an MDMA comedown.<br /><br />After an hour I thought it wasn&#039;t working so I took another capsule.<br /><br />It was the scariest &quot;forever&quot;, ever. I just wanted it to end. It went on for at least 12 hours and I cried when things finally started to get back to normal.<br /><br />Set/setting etc... lol.

Although it&#039;s easy to &quot;get out of hand&quot; on the stuff, it&#039;s so much fun as a party drug. I&#039;ll take it over MDMA in that sense any day. Love it, love it, love it! Great for sexy times too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not done mescaline but this is now highest on my to do list. The more I read about it, the less I fear it, the more beautiful and profound it sounds. Psychedelic phenethylamines thus far have been nothing but kind to me I&#039;ve discovered, after tryptamines seem to have turned their back on me, or at least my state of mind over the past few years and I&#039;m thankful that SR has made their exploration possible. I&#039;m choosing to postpone it for an undecided special set and setting for the future but I can&#039;t wait for the opportunity to explore grand daddy mescaline sometime in the future. <br /><br />Historically, I can&#039;t recall a time when the two options were available at the same time from quality vendors as they currently are. I see the dilemna. <br /><br />I tried Dr.MDA&#039;s MDA recently and enjoyed it very much (same with 3Janes not long ago). His is brown MDA is to LL&#039;s brown sand MDMA, as 3Janes&nbsp; white MDA is to white dutch crystal MDMA, imo. Sort of a &quot;full spectrum&quot;, if you will. Both awesome and subtly distinct. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve had enough MDMA to appreciate the subtle differences I&#039;m refering to (which are difficult to express). <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d love to hear your report on mescaline, and with summer drawing to a close that would be my choice if a desireable set/setting were also on the horizon.<br /><br />edit: I&#039;ve become interested in 5-meo-mipt too as of late.

				<br />For me, ecstasy (MDMA, MDA) just never lived up to its name. Then I ate some mescaline cactus and I understood the meaning. <br />Later on, I walked away with the thought that cacti was soul medecine, that I didn&#039;t know I needed until I took it.<br /><br />The thing I don&#039;t like about mescaline is that it is a really impotent compound compared to even MDA. 2 to 3 good doses per gram vs. 10 doses.<br /><br />I also much prefer cacti to extract or synthetic mescaline. There was a lot more going on in all departments. <br /><br />That said, I enjoy some MDA on occasion with the right people.

				I was romanticized into the idea of M after reading about Aldous Huxley&#039;s introduction to it and his talk of the intensity and beauty of the flowers, plus Shulgin&#039;s stories, and the stories of the tribes getting closer to &quot;god&quot; with the aid of cacti. It took me ages to do the extraction.<br /><br />I would like to do it again one day, I just worry that I&#039;m not mentally strong enough to deal with hallucinogens in general. If anyone&#039;s going to have a bad trip, I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s me. Since the age of 19 (a few years after doing seriously fat nightly bong mixes), I have been unable to handle pot. It sends me into insane paranoia and nervous shakes. I even used to try writing down my pot-induced negative brainstorms, in the hope that I could rationalize them, but the inability to string one thought into another, and the thunderstorm of new negative thoughts, just makes any sort of rationalization completely impossible.

				Well everyone, the mescaline orders have arrived and they are looking mighty fine!<br />I applaud gammagoblin on his packaging and professionalism. I also look forward to trying this lovely substance when the time is right.<br /><br />I also got some 5-meo-mipt, which I must say is quite potent.<br />After transferring it from the baggie into a vial, some of the excess powder fell onto the table (a very small amount, just looked like specks of dust here and there so maybe ~2 mg?) and I decided to snort it. Even with such a small dose, I felt a distinct mood lift and slight euphoria, much like Ballzinator said I should expect. I can definitely understand the coke-ness to it, and especially the sexual tones of the drug. Very nice and enjoyable, but I can also say (with experience) that this drug is to be treated with respect, as with higher doses can send users into a very long hedonistic trip that might leave the user feeling quite shitty (or smugly good) about the way they behaved. <br /><br />Much love!

				I dont mean to crash or anything.. But I am super interested in Mescaline, now more than ever after reading peoples opinion about it on here.&nbsp; How much would be considered a dose?&nbsp; How much do you guys usually take when you get it?&nbsp; Im debating whether to buy 1 or 2 g from gammagoblin.

I&#039;ve heard the dose being as high as 300-500 mg as well, so it would be worth looking into. I&#039;ve been saving my mescaline for a special occasion, so I still haven&#039;t tried it, but I am very happy to have it as part of my collection :)

				If you want to make your own cacti tea, get two feet of Bridgesii cactus, a pressure cooker, freeze the cactus, take the waxy skin off and cook it up. Then boil all the liquid down to half a cup. Drink with juice and you are there. Im about to do this very soon, I already have the syrup tea... :) Just need to allocate 12 hours...
