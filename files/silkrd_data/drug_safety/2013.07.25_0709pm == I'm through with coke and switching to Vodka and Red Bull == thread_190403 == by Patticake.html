				I&#039;ve been doing drugs of various types for over 25 years. I&#039;m not addicted to anything particular and use them occasionally these days. <br /><br />In my country we used to always get fairly pure coke and also only paid around $40-50 a gram maximum until about 5-10 years ago . Now days it&#039;s 50% crap due to greedy people that have no idea of how to run a business or retain customers. <br /><br />So I turned to silk road in the hope of finding some great gear again. Reading ratings from buyers in SR listings is just a waste of time. Most have no idea what they are talking about and will rate the seller 5/5 even though occasionally their comments say the stuff is just OK or there was some sort of issue. If the coke is not as the seller described why would you give them a high rating? It just makes it hard for others to work out what&#039;s what. Are you scared to rate the sellers as they should be rated?<br /><br />The forums offer a bit more help and searching the seller&#039;s name will often reveal a bit more about unhappy customers or very happy customers. Still, you often can&#039;t be sure a single bad comment is not from a competitor trying to rubbish someone or otherwise the seller has multiple accounts and rating his own stuff really good. The only fairly sure way is when several trusted members of the community have made objective posts. <br /><br />I&#039;ve bought mushrooms, E&#039;s and MDMA on SR very successfully and thought I&#039;d give the coke a try while on holiday. At prices averaging around $120 it was a little steeper than I was comfortable with but reckoned at that price it must be fairly decent. After much research I narrowed down it down to a couple of vendors that were in the country I was visiting. Even then, there were some conflicting messages about how good the gear was, the ratings were high but the comments sometimes not so encouraging. &quot;Probably just people not knowing their stuff&quot; I rationalized. So I went with a person that claimed their coke was straight off the block and totally uncut. He also made high claims of being a businessman and in it for the long run. <br /><br />Ordered the stuff and got it in a few days. That night I gave it a go and as soon as it was up my Schnoz I knew it was not the real thing. Definitely cut to hell despite promises to the contrary. Next day I rated him a 3/5. Now being a &quot;businessman&quot; you would have thought he&#039;d message me and find out what he could do to make it up to me for selling crap that he promised was great. No, he messaged me and basically called me a dick for rating him a 3, he thought I should have got in touch with him to &quot;work something out&quot; rather than rate him honestly. <br /><br />In the mean time I had tried another larger line just to see if I had maybe missed something. No, this time it was far worse, I was very jittery and anxious and was awake for hours and hours. The next day felt very spacy and out of sorts and when blowing my nose there was a fair amount of blood that came with it. Gave some to a friend and he had the same experience. <br /><br />I had a look to see if maybe I paid a bit more if it would be any better. Seems not, even people selling for up to $180 a gram or more have comments about bad cutting agents being detected. So I&#039;ve decided it&#039;s really not worth it any more. I&#039;m not putting my health at risk for a short lived and crappy high. There are basically no honest coke dealers out there. And if they are honest today, doesn&#039;t mean they will be tomorrow. <br /><br />So it&#039;s back to good old honest Vodka and Red Bull for the average night out. I know exactly what I&#039;m putting into my system and what the health risks are, I know I&#039;m going to feel warm and fuzzy when I drink it, will be chatty and happy and can dance all night if I want to. Plus it costs me a max of $3 per drink. If I want to get more off my tits I&#039;ll take an e or schrooms from one of the many honest SR dealers who charge great prices and know how to treat their customers. Bye Bye coke, it was great knowing you, maybe one day we&#039;ll cross paths again.

				Coke market doesn&#039;t seem to be the same as it used to be. Unless you&#039;re near the distributor it seems so tempting for people to cut it and then hype it up as something that it&#039;s not. Rather unfortunate, but as long as prohibition is in place, all drugs will have this problem. People will continue to cut mdma or sell methylone as it. 25x compounds will flood the streets as acid. The fact is, human greed overcomes almost anything else and until there are some other checks and balances in the system, it will continue to be this way.

				There is 87/88/89% coke available on SR. For not that much more than 100 bucks in some cases. 89% cocaine is the highest purity you can with cocaine HCl. It can not be purer. <br />I hear a lot of &#039;it&#039;s not how it used to be&#039; talk. But, the tests show it is as pure as it gets. Maybe it&#039;s not the cocaine...&nbsp; :-X

				Well, there is diet red bull for that problem :D<br /><br />On a more serious note, i think it may be a good idea to actually have a lab that analyses stuff sold on SR for purity and dangerous contaminants. <br /><br />The problem with it is that the equipment for such a facility would be quite expensive (think hplc, gc/ms). Having such testing facilities would greatly improve quality of substances available since it would catch virtually every con and cutter, but who is willing to pay for it?<br /><br />Setting up such a lab would easily cost $100k in equipment and chemicals alone, and i seriously doubt we could raise that amount here. As it would deal with illicit subtances it would also be very hard to crowd fund such a facility, despite i have little doubt it would be feasible to get enough people to participate. Any ideas on solving that problem?

				of course it&#039;s overrated.&nbsp; it&#039;s one of the most addictive substance known to man.&nbsp; the average user won&#039;t think it&#039;s amazing, but will want to do more and more and more regardless.&nbsp; that gives the impression that it must be awesome, coupled with the high prices, and it sells itself.

I didn&#039;t read all of it yet so will have a run through. The only issue I can see is that if the vendor provided the sample knowing it is going to be tested they may very well have provided an uncut sample, not the regular stuff they sell. Still, there are several anonymous listings there and very up to date, nice!

				Vendors sending better quality to test labs can be circumvented by taking random samples sent in by actual customers. Analysis for purity of cocain do to require large samples at all, something like 0.1 gram would suffice. Obviously you then get the issue of trusting the actual customers to send you a representative sample, although getting samples from multiple customers of a single vendor would be able to deal with that: Even if the customers would have messed with the sample, that would stand out unless they all used the exact same methods and materials to cut it. <br /><br />This goes for other drugs as well. You can do a good analysis of substances like mdma or benzodiazepines from a single tablet. Mostly you could do it from half a tablet or less, but cutting a tablet in exactly 2 identical halves is so difficult it would probably mess up any quantitative analysis. though screening for contaminants would still be possible.

				for me the best lab test is when you use it. my experience buying on SR is not much different from the street quality-wise, but the price is about 150%.<br /><br />my own guess it&#039;s a lucky find to get even 30% when buying retail.<br /><br />when the product comes in, the top level buyer will probably cut in by a third, so it&#039;s already maybe 50%<br /><br />mid level guy will cut it more and then the retail guy to.<br /><br />for me if it&#039;s even 20% it should work nicely (except for dealing with cuts&#039; side effects)<br /><br />there&#039;s more and more product&nbsp; sold retail that maybe a 10% or less, hence you&#039;d need to do a half a freakin bag to get an effect, but then the cuts kick in, looks like bad market out there.

				I understand, OP. I&#039;ve ordered cocaine half a dozen times or so here on the road, from popular vendors and it just isn&#039;t the same stuff I was doing in the 80&#039;s. Maybe coke just doesn&#039;t do it for me anymore. <br /><br />From now on, I&#039;ll use my coin for drugs that I know work and leave the blow for the younger generation.

Maybe i didnt get my point across last post, it is only out of curtesy to inform the vendor beforehand, not to score a deal. <br /><br />I do agree the feedback system on SR is broken, and more honesty and especially knowledge among buyers is needed to adress that issue. But hey, we have the forums, and they are more than enough to help people find the good stuff.<br /><br />Dont be bitter even though you got subpar coke from one vendor.

				Hmmm I was really thinking about trying some coke from sr. Not really my drug only had a few times. I thought maby this would be the place to get some pure stuff. This is not the only complaint I have seen about low quality cocaine being sold as &quot;off the brick&quot;.&nbsp; Ill look into it but one of the small vendors I buy mdma from has .1 samples of cocaine that he soposably cooks all the cuts out. All reviews are high also. May pick up .2 to try but the one gram listings for 120-180 are about out of my thought process by this point.
