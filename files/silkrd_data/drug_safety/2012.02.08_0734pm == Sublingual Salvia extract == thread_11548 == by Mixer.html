				Hello.<br />Me and a friend of mine bought 1g of 5x salvia and experimented with it, and now we have 0.4g left. We&#039;d like to try a different RoA than smoking. So i thought about making a salvia blotter (I&#039;m pretty good at chemistry) and taking it sublingually, which would work exactly like a quid but without the taste.<br />Will 0.2g each have some effects or is it better to smoke it? We don&#039;t want to trip, just to get that strange spacey salvia feeling.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				The problem is bioavailability...&nbsp; see this NIH study &quot;Lack of effect with sublingual Salvinorin A&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063546/

				Yeah i read that study but looking at Erowid people say it works:<br /><br />hXXp://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24597<br />hXXp://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=45926<br /><br />(I will be making the blotter in a slightly more yielding way)<br /><br />The first guy uses 5g to make 5 blotters, so that&#039;s 1g/blotter of plain salvia which is 0.2g of salvia 5x.<br />Oh well, i guess we just have to try it out. I&#039;ll report back on tuesday ;)

				Ooowww i had only half of what i thought was left :( i think i weighted it wrong... anyway i was nicely surprised because i thought it wouldn&#039;t do anything. Here&#039;s my recipe:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">0.18g of Salvia Divinorum standardized 5x extract and 20ml of acetone were cooled to -10Â°C for 4 hours. 10ml of the acetone was added to the salvia and the mixture was stirred and left in the dark for 2 minutes. The mixture was filtered, the liquid was kept and the salvia was returned to the other 10ml of acetone. The mixture was stirred, left in the dark for 2 minutes and filtered. The salvia was discarded and the liquid was added to the first one. The solution was reduced to a couple of drops of volume evaporating the acetone on an hot water bath. The solution was put on two blotters using a pipette and the blotters were dried.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Each blotter has about 1mg of salvinorin a. I took one keeping it in my mouth without swallowing for 15 minutes. At T+0:20 i felt slight effects, i guess i hit the threshold dose. I was slightly lightheaded and i felt off of baseline though i can&#039;t describe it. My friend felt the same, so it&#039;s definitely not placebo. He also noticed a bit of euphoria. It wasn&#039;t a great experience but it confirms the blotter works. I&#039;ll get more salvia asap and try higher doses :)

				Interesting.&nbsp; A sublingual or even an oral dose of Salvinorin A sufficient for an actual trip would be great.&nbsp; Salvia Divinorum treated with extract is way too damned harsh to smoke and enjoy it.&nbsp; I wonder if the side effects will change by this RoA.&nbsp; If there were a way to rid one&#039;s self of the constant &quot;feel like I&#039;m sweating but I&#039;m not&quot; feeling, that would be cool.

				The trouble with a lot of the commercial salvia is that it is just dried and not cured, curing makes a massive difference to smoothness and taste as well as effects.

				I&#039;ve never tried fresh salvia so i don&#039;t know how it is, but I&#039;m talking about putting pure Salvinorin A on a blotter and taking it sublingually. My extract has exactly 12.5mg of Salvinorin A per gram. How would curing change the effects of the extracted salvinorin? :)
