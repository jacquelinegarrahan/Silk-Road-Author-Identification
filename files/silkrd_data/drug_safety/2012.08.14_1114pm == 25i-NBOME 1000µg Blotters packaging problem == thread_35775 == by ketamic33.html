				Hi SR community....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I recently purchased some of these from a seller I won&#039;t name so that I can discuss my packaging problem without hindrance.<br /><br />I received the package fine, opened it up and saw the blotters in the baggie. All looked well, but alas, when i carefully removed the blotters from the baggie I noticed the shape of them perfectly imprinted, twice, in different locations along with residue(?).<br /><br />I am worried that a lot of &#039;da good shit&#039; has leaked into the baggie. I imagine if this is the case, then the residue on the baggie will be extremely difficult to dose accurately. I have never experimented with this substance before and only bought some on the advice of an online acquaintance. I understand there are a lot of people with A LOT of knowledge on this family of chemicals... So please bestow said knowledge upon me&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I have tried to discuss my problem as fully as possible without revealing too much information.<br />Sorry if this message is inappropriate in any way, just wanted some solid advice from the community! <br />

				my order for these was shipped today, although it was marked in transit 4 days ago. Hope mine are not damaged like yours. Im not an experienced person in this category and not sure if it can or is leaked out of the blotter but i hope for your sake and mine that they are in good condition.

				Yea, I hope they&#039;re ok too...&nbsp; :(<br />I think a viable solution would be to wrap the blotters in foil/clingfilm? To absorb to moisture in a small surface area? and also it was a 3/4 ounce baggie... odd much?<br />I&#039;m not trying to discredit this seller, it was a non-dom order so i understand there may have been a lot of pressure on the letter&nbsp; during transit too.... Any advice regarding what I should do would be helpful...<br />Thanks

				Is the residue just ink from the blotters?<br /><br />Generally the good stuff is absorbed inside the blotter, and can&#039;t normally be scraped off.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest just trying a blotter and seeing if it&#039;s as potent as it should be.

				Same thing happened to me and I haven&#039;t tested them nor was I concerned. Get a coin and put it in a bag and put something heavy over it. I&#039;m pretty sure the coin will mold into the bag a little bit. The ink could&#039;ve been fresh, but I know the blotters were fresh too.<br /><br />I might eat one tonight. I doubt it&#039;ll make too much of a difference. Most of the substance should be absorbed by the blotter. Try putting the bag on your upper gums and see if you trip. ;)

But this shit&#039;s insanely potent. I just wish it didn&#039;t have the imprint so I never would&#039;ve doubted it! Fuck knows, I&#039;m just gonna have to use all the tabs and attempt to gauge what kind of doses they were?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the advice.
