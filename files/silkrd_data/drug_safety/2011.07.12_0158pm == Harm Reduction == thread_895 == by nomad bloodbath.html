				Any questions involving any drugs and how to use them properly and safely should be asked in this section of the forum.<br />Don&#039;t be shy, your body is your temple and how you treat it should be your number 1 concern.<br /><br />No question is too dumb, this forum is about helping you be safe and responsible, esp with drugs you want to experience but have never gotten to until now.<br /><br />Be safe and live joyfully with your pursuit of happiness. :D

				Harm reduction....&quot; Never take anymore than you can handle and always know your dealer&quot;- Mr.Show w/ Bob and Dave. Done deal. If you are experimenting, go small. Learn what you are doing and how it effects you. Go small a few times to make sure you understand the effects on you over time. Then after a few times, gradually increase dosage until you reach the desired effect, if you haven&#039;t reached it already. There is no need to go &quot;all in&quot; on time one, two, or three. Go big or go home doesn&#039;t apply here! Everyones level of tolerance differs. Remember that. And when someone dies (people die everyday), it&#039;s not SR&#039;s fault. They would have found &quot;it&quot; somewhere or done something worse. They were already on a self destructive coarse. Even the casual user of &quot;it &quot;has to be careful. Think about what you are doing. Just b/c it was great last time doesn&#039;t mean much this time. It&#039;s been a while. Hence the term casual user. It may effect you differently now. Good or bad. Be careful and think!!

				I&#039;m not sure if this is the correct place to post this, so I&#039;m going to post this in a few places.<br /><br />I bought some H from italian pilot and snorted it because it was my first time doing H and wasn&#039;t comfortable IV&#039;ng. I got reallllllyyyyy messed up and wound up sleeping it off. The next day or two i noticed all the skin around my nostrils was pealing off. This has never happened to me before and was wondering if this was because of bad cut or is it just me. If its bad cut I would want everyone to know for safety&#039;s sake.<br /><br />Any info would be greatly appreciated.
