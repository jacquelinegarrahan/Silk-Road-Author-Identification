				I can&#039;t stop blaming myself for being such an idiot. I sold some partyflock pills (~200 mg mdma) to some mdma newbies. I explicitly told them to start with HALF A PILL because it was very strong. Result: they all ODed, 2 took 2 pills and one took 3. What followed was madness, puking and a really bad comedown. One of them swore never to take drugs ever again (he almost set the house on fire, he was smoking like a fucking animal and at one point he forgot he had a cigarette in his hand and set fire to the bed). I told him it wasn&#039;t the drug, it was just him being stupid and taking too much for first time (he was so stupid he took another pill during the comedown which did not have any effect as his body was already beyond exhausted). <br />So, I&#039;ve learnt my lesson, this shit is for experienced users as SR quality is not even comparable with street quality. I will never take any chance with noobs ever again. Ever!

				Stupid people take drugs and tend to do stupid thing when there high.<br />Don&#039;t blame yourself cause some little fool lit his bed on fire out of his head.<br /><br />You sold them some of the best quality ecstasy there is, It&#039;s not your fault they didn&#039;t know how to handle it!<br />Just lean from the mistake, Don&#039;t sell to people who don&#039;t know what they are doing. It will only cause you grief in the end.

				This is why I always sell in ~120mg bombs in rizla. Even if I&#039;ve got the ~200mg pills from here I crush them up and put half and bit inside the rizla. Most people have no respect for MDMA/xtc, its pretty sad tbh.

				Regular shitty connections, especially in rural and suburban parts are used to bullshitting. Even on the silk road, I&#039;ve seen a lot of shit advertised as &quot;99% pure&quot; that wasn&#039;t. Almost killed myself on some stuff that might have actually been (ironically didn&#039;t advertise the purity, just said it was stronger than most stuff out there). They obviously deserved to die, but I guess next time you gotta refuse to sell them a full pill or something. Tell them your pills are triple hits or something. You could even charge them extra I guess. Such are the ways or the black market. You never know what you&#039;re gonna get. A pot dealer can say it&#039;ll put you in space and have it do nothing and and MDMA dealer will say &quot;hey, be careful&quot; and you&#039;ll almost OD. So fucking hell. I don&#039;t know the answer.

I knew the partyflocks were much better, but I didn&#039;t want to sound like I was ripping them off. I explicitly told them to fucking start with half, even one pill would have been too much for someone who never tried mdma before, not to mention some people are more sensitive to it than others. Well now I have one less customer, just because he is so stupid and doesn&#039;t understand it&#039;s not the drug, it&#039;s him taking too much of it.

				To get an understanding of just how stupid these people were, one of them told me he thought if he took only half a pill he will become &quot;stuck&quot; in one stage. Obviously he had no idea wtf he was dealing with and didn&#039;t want to listen. These people simply do not understand mdma pills aren&#039;t made by fucking pfizer and can be of varying quality/strenght. I mean they were so stupid I had to use the word &quot;ecstasy&quot; because they had no idea what mdma was lol. <br />That&#039;s why I blame myself, I knew they were idiots, yet I still sold them the pills without thinking about the consequences.

				one time i gave a guy some weed cookies i made and he wanted a second he was like &quot;oh gimme two, one doesnt seem like enough&quot; but i didnt.. but anyway this jovial guy went all quiet and i go into the loungeroom and him and his gf are sitting there and she snarles at him &quot;what did you give him? what did you put with the pot in the cookies??&quot; and &quot;his heart is beating fast&quot; and i said &quot;nothing&quot; and cant remember much of what happened after but ever since... no giving any drug to anybody.. even if they demand it or promise to take responsibility for themselves.<br /><br />nobody takes responsibilty for the,seves with drugs if they go down.. and if they do youy always gotta deal with family memebers that want to crush you with a hammer.. so dont give drugs to nobody... espcially people u dont know.

				It&#039;s people being stupid indeed, and it doesn&#039;t really depend what drug they are introduced to. <br /><br />You can give someone that has never drunk alcohol before a liter bottle of vodka with the explicit instructions not to drink over a quarter of that in one night. You&#039;ll likely find the bottle emptied beyond half and the person in a puddle of puke the morning after - seems to be human nature.

				I never deal or sell unless I&#039;m hooking up friends with good stuff (I would rather they took drugs from me than from shady street people of whom I don&#039;t know the quality and/or what&#039;s even in the pill)<br /><br />A long time ago I used to be generous about giving/selling away extras we had from a partying night because it usually covered my tickets/transportation/gas costs without exposing me to being high profile or getting attention as a source.<br /><br />Well usually things go great, I give a molly cap away here or there, people love it and want to know if i can hook them up with more, but I usually tell them I can&#039;t do that since I have to go through a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy...etc. (I don&#039;t tell people I use the road).<br /><br />Well one night this one guy wouldn&#039;t quit badgering me to trade him a cap for his pressed pill (which i looked up on pillreports, was apparently MDAI, so I told him I didn&#039;t have anything) -- to which he kept insisting that my friend told him I did have some left over (Fucker was so high he wouldn&#039;t stop bragging bout how good his roll was to people)<br /><br />Anyway I ended up giving him our last 120mg cap for free just so he&#039;d leave me the fuck alone and I didn&#039;t need money, so I figured spreading good vibes was always fun.<br /><br />An hour later he comes back yelling at me saying I gave him mephedrone, or methedrone or something of that nature and that he warned everyone to stay away from me because that could kill people.<br /><br />Ruined my night, made my friends mad because they thought i thought they were liars (I know they wouldn&#039;t do that shit, and I know they didn&#039;t, the douchebag kept telling me my friend &quot;admitted to it&quot;)<br /><br />Second of all, who the fuck complains about free drugs?<br /><br />Third of all, it really is some of the best molly you can get your hands on anywhere.&nbsp; Cloudsurfer&#039;s gear is a gold standard for MD on the road, and I&#039;ve rolled since the 90s.&nbsp; To have a douchebag pester you for molly all night, question it, only to be reassured by like 8 ppl it&#039;s great gear, then come back and spread bad vibes between me and my crew, after he got 120mg of pristine MDMA for FREE...<br /><br />So as a rule now, I don&#039;t sell or gift my drugs to anyone except really trusted friends.&nbsp; THe worst part is that now possibly there&#039;s a lotof people in a community I frequent who think I deal dangerous drugs or bunk and sell it as the real deal.<br /><br />Pisses me off to no end, but even the douchebag&#039;s friend came up and apologized to me about it, so I can only hope most people won&#039;t judge without talking to me first.&nbsp; <br /><br />So yeah, OP is on the ball, don&#039;t deal or share your drugs with idiots.

				I have a story with 25I nbome and people being completely retarded with it.&nbsp; anyway it started out with me getting 100 hits of 25i that were 1mg each on blotter paper.&nbsp; I sold probably 8 ten strips and kept the rest telling everyone i sold it to that it was called 25i nbome its a research chemical and only to take 1 for their first time.&nbsp; I then went on to say NOT to tell people it was acid because it was not. I said if someone thinks its real acid and takes 4 tabs for their first time they would have a Horrible Horrible powerful trip with sever vasoconstriction blah blah blah. anyway one of my dumb as friends who i sold 30 too sold a ten strip and told the kid he gave the to it was double dosed LSD soaked in bottles or some shit? anyway the dude took 3 1/2 tabs and ended up having sever od symptoms and at one point started to have&nbsp; seizures. Idk why kids never listen to what you tell them i think in this case it was just for my friend to make easy money and not have to worry about people being freaked out about the name of 25i reasearch chem.&nbsp; people are dumb as hell. but personally i tossed 4 of the tabs in my lip one night and it literally felt like i smoked meth so stimulating.. but i has a VERY HIGH tollerance at the time took 1 tab a week before and 2 tabs 2 days before. anyway fuck stupid people

				In fact i&#039;d say you took all precautions. If you supply benzo&#039;s to someone and insist they should never take them in combination with opiates and/or alcohol, you gave your fair share of information. This is no different than the information that would be provided to them at a pharmacy.<br /><br />People may choose to use dosages or combinations advised against and sometimes suffer the consequences. Noone sues the liquor store if one of their clients kill themselves with drinking too much, right?<br /><br />

				yea i may not be responsible if someone dies from my drugs, but I&#039;d rather it not happen. I&#039;ve long stopped selling any downers (opiates, benzos, barbiturates). I only sell weed, acid, adderall or mdma. Is it posssible to OD if someone takes a crazy amt of mdma? <br />I&#039;ve heard no, but I cant imagine its good for your brain if someone takes 1 gram of mdma.I think ppl take so much mdma because theyre so used to be being sold fake or weak product, so when you sell them pure product, they take alot bec they wanna feel it..

				i used to part alot with pressed pokeballs back in the day when they where out. and one day me and this girl i used to party with out friends we ate maybe 5 or 6 and got us barly rolling so about 4 hours later we wanted more so i droped 4 or 5 i dont remember because we crushed some up on the table. and she droped 3 and ate a little powder. well that was the worst mistake of my life giving her 3 of them. for the next 7 hours she couldnt walk or talk! her eyes wouldnt stop rolling in the back of her head and her arms where like a person that couldnt controll them and kept them curled to ther face. when she would have to go to the bathroom becsause she was tripping so hard and couldnt controle herself she would just roll over and like almost like she died and fall over instantly. after seening her start to look like shes going to od it killed everything i dropped that night. and only thing i could think is my best friend is going to die on me. it was so crazy and scary to see its hard to even explain how she looked like and acted, the sounds and way she looked look like she really wasnt going to make it. <br />Be supper carfule with how much you take i have takin 1 gram before in&nbsp; night and you will not like it the next day. 1 gram is for someone that has takin alot of MDMA in their life time. <br /><br />As for the other person that the girl died, you can not grief over something that was not in your hands. i dont want to sound men or anything. but the way i look at it god has plans for everyone and no one can change anything that he has planed for you.. hope this helps a little

				I&#039;m not a vendor and I don&#039;t supply friends so maybe my word means little, but what exactly can you do? If they know you&#039;re concerned about dose and they want more they&#039;ll invent some extra people. All you can do is be honest about what you&#039;re supplying and any precautions they need to observe, and the rest is up to them. If they want to run in traffic, it&#039;s not like you can stop them. <br /><br />Now doing shit like passing off NBOMes as LSD, there&#039;s no fucking excuse whatsoever. But between here and there is a wide fucking gulf.

Like 18-20? Because I&#039;ve noticed this thing with&nbsp; this younger &quot;#YOLO #SWAG generation&quot; where they&#039;re so fucking retarded and think they know things about drugs simply because, as you accurately point out, they abused prescription over the counter drugs where you have to take a lot of it &quot;to get fucked up&quot; and assume all drugs work that way. It&#039;s all about &quot;getting fucked up&quot; too, that&#039;s why they don&#039;t respect the drugs. My friends and used to sell weed, salvia, 2Cs and shrooms. When selling to friends our age and older, people listened. People went on Erowid and did their homework before ingesting a substance. They respected the drug. But these young faggots don&#039;t respect anything. Privacy, music, their own bodies so why do you expect them to respect drugs? They all heard some rapper or DJ (don&#039;t get me wrong I love rap/hip-hop/techno) talking about getting fucked up on that Molly so they have to get fucked up on it too.&nbsp; We had a dude buy some salvia that was 50X and told him that was way too strong for a first time, but it&#039;s all we had and he should do a little bit of it first, in a quiet setting with a trusted babysitter and give it a try. What does he do? Goes to a frat party with tons of chaos, drunk people, loud music and does the whole damn thing we sold him at once. He freaked out so bad the EMS was called because people thought he was having a seizure and everyone was filming his poor, scared-to-hell ass rolling around on the dance floor and posting it on Facebook. That&#039;s how we found out about it too. <br /><br />Dumb fucking kids man. First rule of drugs -- don&#039;t give them to crazy people. Second rule of drugs -- Don&#039;t give them to dumb people. <br /><br />They ruin it for the rest of us trying to be responsible.

				Young people aren&#039;t the only ones who are idiots, when i first started using silk road when i was at my parents, i had got a gram of speed, my parents stole it, they both did half a gram because &quot;they weren&#039;t expecting it to be that strong&quot;, they ended up speeding for like 36 hours and ended up with the worst speed hangover they ever had.
