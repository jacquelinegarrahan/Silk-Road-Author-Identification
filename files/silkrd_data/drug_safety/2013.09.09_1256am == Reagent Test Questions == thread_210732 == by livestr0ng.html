				At least a day ago, I PM&#039;ed febbeaio2468 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6925a24ee4), a vendor of regeant tests, some questions. He read it early on but never replied which is a little strange considering this quote from his page:<br /><br />&quot;I look at myself as &#039;Mom and Pop&#039; type of vendor [...]. This is currently my only job so I take this very seriously because this is my only income right now. I won&#039;t rip anyone off and I will bend over backwards to fix any problem because I&#039;ll go broke if I fuck this up. I thank you for your business and if you need a custom listing just send me a PM.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, whatever, that&#039;s not the point. Here&#039;s my PM:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello,<br /><br />Sorry to bug you but I have a few questions. First, on the picture of the Mandelin test [http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b317aedfd0], it says its for amphetamines and methadone, however, in the title and description it says it tests for Ketamine. Other internet sources say it tests for a bunch of other stuff. At this point I&#039;m just confused. Can you please clarfy? Second, the Morris test [http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f559c7a9e9] seems to be exclusively for Ketamine so can you compare the Morris and Mandelin tests? Third, for the Ehrlich test [http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d4c270bf0d], is a full tab of the presumed LSD necessary for the test to work properly? Next, do all of your test kits come factory sealed? Do they contain more detailed instructions in them? Finally, if I was to buy two different tests at the same time, would there be any way to combine shipping? Again, sorry for all the questions and thank you for your time. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If anybody can answer any of my questions, I&#039;d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading. <br />

				Get them from Dancesafe.org -- they are legal and test for a variety of substances.&nbsp; You can read all about the instructions on them there.&nbsp; It is really important to get and do all of the tests, IMO.&nbsp; They are $20 each or $65 for all 4.&nbsp; &nbsp;But you should also read up on the reagents because they don&#039;t provide all of the information there.&nbsp; For example, Simon A/B reacts to secondary -amines (like methamphetamine).&nbsp; Their chart shows a few of them but not all of them.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth doing a little homework to understand what each reagent actually reacts to in more technical terms.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a degree in chemistry to learn what they are capable of and what they&#039;re not capable of.<br /><br />Each test can identify usually a set of substances, but with the additional data of subsequent tests, it becomes possible to rule out certain ones and confirm others.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				yea i&#039;d definitely agree you&#039;d be better off just buying from a website like dancesafe or bunkpolice. i suppose some countries are a little stricter about test kits, i heard canada was maybe? i&#039;m not sure where you are but if you think that would be an issue check out eztest.com, their reagent is in gel form so it ships just about anywhere.<br /><br />as far as the mandelin test goes, it tests for many things, principally ketamine. it also tests for cocaine, oxycodone, amphetamines, cathinones, PMA, and a bunch of other shit. it&#039;s a handy kit to have. kinda like how the marquis test is most usually for E but it tests a wide range. or ehrlich&#039;s, which tests for tryptamines, principally LSD. as far as your second question, you really only need to use enough paper to be able to clearly see if it turns. the more you use, the better i suppose, just to be 100% sure, but one whole tab really isn&#039;t necessary. i don&#039;t really know much about the morris test, maybe someone else can fill you in on that.

This vendor has them for under $10 with shipping. Everwhere I look is at least $16 for 10 tests. I only want 1. Also, I want one for K and one for LSD so that&#039;d put me at $32-$40 for probably a one time thing. Actually I have some DMT I guess I could test for fun and some MDMA I could test for fun. But the K and LSD are more important. Oh interesting info. Thank you. But why do you suggest dancesafe over everything else?

I&#039;m in USA so I don&#039;t think they would get seized or anything. <br /><br />Mandelin (basically)=K. Ehrlich=LSD and half a tab should be good for a test. Got it. I appreciate your honesty about the Morris test. <br /><br />Thanks for the advice!

				Any other miscellaneous yet relevant information is completely welcome- from personal experience buying them to testing a product that wasn&#039;t what you thought it was to watching a piece of shit asshole cop test your amazing ecstasy right in front of you and try to scare you because it tested positive for meth (...he was a douche).
