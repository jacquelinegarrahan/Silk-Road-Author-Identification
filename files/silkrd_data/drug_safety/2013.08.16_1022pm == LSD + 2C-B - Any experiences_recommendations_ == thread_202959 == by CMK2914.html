				Going to a day-long concert with some friends this weekend, and while I was planning on just taking 20-25mg of 2C-B, a friend popped up and asked if I wanted any LSD for the day.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure someone here has tried the combo, any insight into the experience or recommendations on dosage?&nbsp; The blotter is probably around 150-200 mics, and I&#039;m trying to figure out what amount of 2C-B would augment the experience well, and in what order/timing to take each (was thinking the L first, then perhaps a lower dosage of 2C-B a little later?)<br /><br />Thanks guys

				I did this combo at a music festival + MDMA. It was actually very nice, the hallucinations lasted a VERY long time though. Long after I went home that night. Started at around 11am and was still tripping out at 2am the next day.<br /><br />I did 19mg of 2C-B, then took 100mg of MDMA an hour later. After the third hour I took the 110mic blotter of LSD and was tripping for a solid 10+ more hours. I smoked a small hit of DMT while me and a buddy were close to the stage, as soon as I inhaled the stage split in half and I instantly started zoning out HARD.<br /><br />Maybe try taking the LSD, wait an hour or two for it to kick in, and once you&#039;re feeling the effects take around 15-20mg of 2C-B, I wouldn&#039;t go over that as it has a very steep dosage curve and the acid will already be in full effect. It really depends how hard you want to trip.

				LSD first, when it starts to creep in AFTER the &#039;anxiety&#039; rush, then your biggest 2c-B dose, my opinion put it in a rolling paper and swallow it.Then re-dose 2c-B always in lower dosage when desired.<br /><br />Keep some xanny or some benzo along,you may need it after all your subsequent doses of 2c-B to calm it,BUT if you need a Benzo after LSD and before the Rc then DON&#039;T do the 2c-B.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I would also suggest trying 2-4 tabs of LSD, 18-20 mg 2C-E, and 12-18 mg 2C-P. It&#039;s a really amazing combination. Positively blissful, magical, and colorful -- Especially during the daytime!

				Knew you guys would come in with some bangin&#039; advice, thanks!<br /><br />I would normally go with a little more LSD, but I have to meet with a client the next afternoon, so I need to respect limits so that I can be functional the next day.&nbsp; Sad reality of adulthood, huh?&nbsp; <br /><br />Gonna start with the blotter, then after peak, when I sense it is starting to tail off, go with somewhere between 10-20mg of 2C-B (will have to judge at the time based on how I feel and what I can handle without being a tard the next day) and maybe a little MDMA on top.<br /><br />I will certainly report back!

				sorry that it is not 100% related to the topic but I saw a bit a similar topic last week where a guy asked about candyflipping followed by 2cb.<br /><br />so definitely from what people write here, this combo is possible. <br /><br />I would be also interested in this combo LSD+2cb<br /><br />and if some of u say its also possible to spice it up with MDMA on top, then well, why not ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				My best drug experience yet is doing 2C-B then LSD consecutively.&nbsp; It was my first time doing 2C-B (20mg or a little more, extremely high purity) and I ripped the bong a ton, and I tripped absolute sack!&nbsp; Took about 6 hrs to come down completely, then dropped LSD, which lasted another 12.&nbsp; Shit was insane!&nbsp; I&#039;m sure reversing the order would be great too but idk about combining them, they&#039;re both amazing on their own and unless if you&#039;ve done each many times I would suggest doing them consecutively.
