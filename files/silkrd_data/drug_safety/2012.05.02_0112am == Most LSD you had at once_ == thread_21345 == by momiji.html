				How much LSD have you had at once?&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />For years I&#039;ve only had between 50 and 300 mics. I had never tried to go farther, but a friend of mine was looking for enlightenment, even if she didn&#039;t directly say it. She took TONS of shrooms and described the experience like a stroke. She was halfway there and halfway gone. Because of this I decided to do to her what someone did to me years ago. I gave her ~600 mics and then gave her an ego death so she could experience the universe. I&#039;m not quite sure if an ego death is what it is called. It is me watching you, watching me, watching you, and BAM the universe is experiencing itself. She had a blast and it felt like I was walking on clouds from the experience.<br /><br />So I have to ask: What is out there? How far have you guys gone? And I wonder if explaining it is pointless, because I do not know how rare of an experience it is. Throwing away a piece of humanity to become more isn&#039;t something most people can do, or would want to do.<br /><br />Anyone on this forum following what I&#039;m saying? How many of us are there?

				60 hits of paper at once that I got from a dead show I ate it on my 3rd strait day of tripping.&nbsp; It was like a golf ball of acid in my mouth, after I sucked on it for 5 mins people were sucking on it for 30 sec and giving it back lol I would eat one dose or a gram of shrooms today and need 10 mg of xanax.

				Back in the late 90&#039;s at a phish show I took five tabs of &quot;Dancing Elephants&quot; (cool print IMO)&nbsp; Not sure of the dosage of each but it was pretty fucking intense.<br /><br />I remember being able to not only hear the music but to see it coming at me and washing over the audience in waves.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every time I went to talk I wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; Not that I couldn&#039;t, but I just thought what ever I said would be meaningless in the grand scheme of things (not sure how to explain that).&nbsp; And if I did convey a message to a friend or a complete stranger at that concert (didn&#039;t matter which because we were all one at that point) I could simply do it with a look, and transfer a lifetime of knowledge in only a few seconds.<br /><br />I have tripped many times on acid, but this was the most intense experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Momiji, waiting on some LSD you sent, can&#039;t wait!<br />

				i took 3 tabs friday night of the original batch of the mayan pieces from when tony was providing ten strips. and holy shit i tripped harder than i ever had in my life. blotters were tasteless, kicked in pretty fast and hard, so hard i got up from sitting on the couch with my old lady and went to my bed room and closed the door cuz i knew shit was about to get wierd. i laid on my bed and the paisly pattern quilt was moving as if it were alive.the floral wallpaper began to grow and was teaming with little faces, stared at my closet doors which became double helixs (the dna thing) all while the spiral putty design with glitter mixed in on my celing (old hippies lived in my house before me) became like a trippy moving solar system. i decide to get my laptop n listen to trippy music on youtube all the while using the computer is very complicated. came across very trippy psytrance music and the visual patterns were coming off the screen and it seemed as if i could control the patterns with my mind. watched this other video that i had to watch again when i came down to make sure it really existed it was called like jelly trip experience 3d&nbsp; hd or something and i know this sounds insane but it answered every question about life iv ever had. watched it like 5 times check it out n c what u think while trippn balls. around that time i lose all touch with reality kept tring to reming my self that im me and not get brainwashed in the wierd images and sounds of the internet videos( sounds insane but it was fun the whole time) time became immesurable to me and zoned out with complete ego-loss and became one with the universe like i was litterly in space looking around and telepathically comunicated with sum alien style creature entity guy all i really remember about our conversation was sumthing along the lines of were in human shells and the break down over time. during my ego loss while i was one with the universe i felt as if i visited every continent and seen all there was to see. totally realized how powerful my brain was felt like i could look at a picture with a million things on it and my brain just absorb it all at once i know that dont even make any sense now. felt like i seen from the begining of life to the end of time and understood it all. finally i feel like i may want to venture out of my room start seeing the most brilliant rainbow like colors on stuff seem also to be able to see the energies of objects and my girlfriend go sit on the couch where shes watching food network and&nbsp; i cant look at the screen because it was too trippy ( imagine that the food network being too trippy) i lay down and get a foot rub that feels almost orgasmic all while there are egyptians carving heiroglyfics on my celing tiles while simotaniously the woodgrain patterns on my walls are moving like liquid and contain everything that ever has been or would or could be. i know this barely makes since but i was trippn harder than i ever have. at one time my girl asked me what i was seeing i told her ask me later as my communication skills wernt what they normally were. but when she asked there was about a five inch obama guy with six blinking big roung bug eyes staring at me from the patterns in the wall, he was a friendly creature tho and ment me no harm. i decided to go back to the comfort of my smokin room where along the way the floor was covered in spiraling devil faces in a fun not scarry way. i try to smoke a joint which is way more complicated than normal. see all types of shit that i cant even begin to explain in the smoke id blow out. listen to sum old stoner music and enjoy the magic of the room i was in. feel like a nice shower which was also was complicated washed my hair like 5 times probably. laid back in my bed after and listened to classical music on tv which is not my music at all but it just felt right. laying in bed enjoying the wierd shit going on around me i watched the window infront of me go from night to bright crisp day which was a beautiful experience. sat out side and smoked a joint after not being alble to fall asleep the clouds were full of all types of magic and produced the craziest images i could also kinda see the wind like that clear haze over a fire. continued to have faint visuals for awhile as i continued to come down. very clean comedown and never even a hint of naseua. this was the best experience ive ever had with lsd. outperformed every expectation i had and then some.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />copy n pasted from one of my trip reports i totally understand the being one with the universe thing its crazy to try n explain to someone who dont understand . some situations just dont make since when you try to describe them with words. my next trip i plan on going for 500 mics i enjoy the thought of going deeper and like the conscious altering mind expansion of a totally chaotic lsd trip.

				It is a double edged sword (much like everything is in life). Tony&#039;s source was charging him nearly the price Tony was selling the sheets for. Tony made little to no money from selling cid here. When I learned how much Tony was buying his cid for I knew it was only a matter of time before the person laying the awesome cid would stop getting business. However, I didn&#039;t think Tony would go scammer. I expected Tony to find another source so he could actually make some money for his hard work.<br /><br />We don&#039;t know if Tony intentionally went scammer. His source could have screwed him, which is highly likely, or Tony was tired of not making any money and taking on all of the risk so he decided to go scammer so he could make something for all of his work. Who knows what really happened, and honestly I don&#039;t care to find out. I&#039;m not interested in Tony&#039;s contact not Tony himself.<br /><br />TL;DR: Tony&#039;s cid wasn&#039;t going to last for long regardless how it ended.

				A classic story posted years ago about thumbprints, generally regarded to be in the 10,000ug - 50,000ug range. Make&#039;s you think what Robert Hunter went through on his 250,000ug dose....<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anyway as I said in my other thread when you first buy crystal from the family their&#039;s 2 requirement&#039;s. 1. You have to be taught how to lay it properly and be trusted to do so on your own. 2. You have to do a thumbprint. The family believes LSD crystal should only be handled by those with the proper energy or karma to do so. There&#039;s no better way to test somebodys faith of LSD than give them a thumbprint.<br /><br />Originaly thumprints were given by taking the glass vile and puting your thumb over<br />the top of the vile and turning it and fliping it upside down real quick. This put a coating of crystal on your thumb which was pessed into the palm of the person ,leaving your crystal imbedded thumbrint in there palm(hence the term thumprint) where it would absorb(or they might lick it off.).&nbsp; This was your certification :wink:<br /><br />Nowadays thumbprints are eaten. Any time someone eats crystal it&#039;s refered to as a print. This way was adopted because it&#039;s more efficiant.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is hard to describe a thumbprint. Human language cannot describe an experiance that is encompasses all of life. Every cell of every creature or living thing that ever lived or will live is connected by the energy or light. When we die are body and our ego is gone. We become one with eternity or the light or God or whatever name you wish to call it. A thumbprint allows this to happen and rerturn to our physical body. My first print I layed down and quickly realized that this was my actual death. You watch the whole process unfold with complete awareness.<br />I didn&#039;t cling to my body I just realized my life had passed. As I was spiraling up or out I saw my life evolve through the years I lived. The happiness, the sadness,the people I loved and the people I didn&#039;t. The joy that I gave and the pain that I caused. I saw the true nature of reality and why things were the way they were. As I got higher I saw the nature of reality on the cosmic scale and saw that the reason for our evolution was to experiance love. To love is to have experianced the finest of life. Then came the moment were it was time to let go. As I did it came for me and I sobbed uncontrolabley for I realized that the light or energy we call god or creation was perfect. It was pure unconditional love.<br />What else could god have been I realized. That glint of innocent perfection in a baby&#039;s eye. The light was pure as the heart of Jesus Christ. I dissolved into it and died. Since there was no me only the all ,I cannot remember the rest because there was no me to remember. After forever I slowly decended into my body.<br />I spent days awake afterwards talking to myself. I vowed to god to spread LSD so others could see the light. I vowed to look at every person as the lord and treat them as such.<br />I was reborn and continue to live by the values I learned. I became as active as I could spreading LSD. Year after year in hotel rooms with a pyrex pan and watercolor paper. Hoping excitedly that some of these hit&#039;s will help guide my brothers and sisters back towards the light. LSD is a direct message from God. Period. I don&#039;t think we get another chance. We can love each other or we can kill each other ,but it is up to us. As I always say in my threads as a reminder, my work with LSD ended years ago.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The reason behind it is if someone has had LSD before, then they know what to expect. If you want to awaken then the easiest way is to push them into the pool, so to speak. As in, blast them into a new experience.<br /><br />If they never have had LSD before 400 mics should be enough to get the same results if you know what you&#039;re doing.

				I&#039;ve taken a pinky print of raw LSD at least 30+ times.&nbsp; For those who dont know, a pinky print is where you lick your pinky finger tip and dip it into a pile of raw crystal LSD and eat it.&nbsp; The first few times were kinda overwhelming as the peak was about 6-8 hours of full on DMT blast off type stuff and two to three days of coming off of the trip, mild residual visuals three days later.&nbsp; You regain your footing after the super strong peak and can talk again and such, after the first few pinky print sessions you know what to expect and can navigate the experience a little bit better.&nbsp; Though the trip is incredibly intense, and could be overwhelming for some, do not believe any of the bullshit you hear about people going crazy and shit, you might see some truths you&#039;re not ready to accept that scare the shit outta you or do some serious matrix battles with your ego, but you will come down off the drug, it just takes days sometimes with these heavy duty doses.&nbsp; Doses higher than a pinky print, which is approx. 10-30mgs or 30000ugs, I&#039;m completely unfamiliar with and have no experience when it comes to maintaining sanity at those levels.

				Most intense trip I ever had was when I took 3 of the Dalai Lama from Tarp on OVDB last year, shit was awesome. A buddy of mine passed out for a bit because we were going to a rave/show later on that night. Almost thought I was gonna go crazy while I was by myself for hour and half. I just ran around my house basically trying to figure out what to do with myself while he was sleeping. Ended up blasting the Surround Sound in the house not even thinking about him sleeping. He obviously woke up and we smoked a blunt and the good times were back.

				The most I ever ate wash from washing a vail, I was told the vial was Czech fluff. I&#039;m not sure how much but I&#039;m guessing well over 500ug if not a lot more. 20 mins after i could even stand up. I became so thirsty (i had been drinking tequila HEAVY that night) but couldn&#039;t find anything to drink in the fridge even though there was bottles of water and alcohol in there. I was so confused i turned on the sink and started splashing water in my mouth. Finally my roommate told me to lay down and put on some Dave Matthews Band for me and then I was just gone, I actually started to freak out. I was so gone I didn&#039;t even know I tripping anymore, I literally thought I was dying and the world was ending. I started to think about my family and my friends, I thought everyone was going through what I was going through and the world was coming to an end. Eventually I blacked out not sure if it was from the alcohol or the Lsd but there is a good few hours I don&#039;t remember anything. Finally&nbsp; I came to and sat up and took a drink of water and lit a cigarette. From that point on the trip was the most fantastic trip ever. My room mate and I (he was tripping to of the same vial) sat around joking and talking having some beers and cigs. The visuals were out of this world. It looked crazy like not even the same planet. when the sun started to come up (probably about 6hrs after dosing) I went and laid down in my bed starring at the wall and just enjoying the visuals as the mind fuck had started to go away. I&#039;ve read that czech crystal, swiss crystal and the like can be a bit disorienting at larger doses, maybe that could have caused my initial freak out or could have been that I wasn&#039;t expecting that large of dose. since then I haven&#039;t had the balls to take more than 100ug (or one hit of what ever I&#039;ve got).

				Back when I was close to some people who were close to some people on the dead tour we were getting 2 grams of crystal every time they came through and laying it ourselves. I&#039;m not sure if it was a competitive thing among us or we were just a little stupid but we got into mega dosing because our connects turned us on to the idea of eating A LOT at once, talking about astral projection and things like that. Any way puddled many times with wash so I&#039;m not sure of the exact dosage on these occurrences but one time I ate about 60 of the hits we had laid which is around 6000 ug give or take. Let me just say the bulk of these experiences were beautiful and shaped the person I am today but a few were absolutely terrifying. I&#039;m certain the latter were my fault because I ignored important things like set and setting but you should be prepared to see yourself and the world in a way you may or may not like..and always have benzos close by. Oh and yes, astral projection is real. Would I do it now....you bet your sweet ass! ;D

				About 400-500ug going to always have this dose from now it&#039;s so amazing, but I would say I am pretty experienced with the drug now I can control myself.<br /><br />Although I know someone who had 20tabs = 20x 100ug but that&#039;s just too crazy in my opinion, I think everyone finds there best dose, same with weed, to get the effects they like!<br /><br />I think for some people it isn&#039;t fun when you can&#039;t even recall any single thing about what happened on acid.

I wonder what a friend of mine will say in response to it.<br /><br />@jhannm&nbsp; You probably blacked out because you didn&#039;t have anyone to help you into an ego death. On a high dose there is a point where either something amazing happens or you freak out and think you&#039;re dying, or think something else fearful. If you can let go of that baggage you can transcend. Remember, it is extremely safe. You can&#039;t die. ;)<br /><br />@DropGuy751&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wondered about that. I could be lucid, but I&#039;ll recall all of it. The first thing I thought from my first trip years ago was, &quot;It is like dreaming but being awake.&quot; In other words, it is like dreaming, but you remember it all. I guess some people can handle it and some can&#039;t?

				Am I weird? I feel like when I do more and more lsd my headspace doesn&#039;t change, I just hallucinate more (which I do quite enjoy lol). Anything past ~350ug is purely recreational to me and won&#039;t alter my headspace like a heroic dose of mushrooms will. (But I want it to!) My cap is ~1mg though so maybe I just need to dose higher.

Had 2 hits of liquid once and went off this planet, at a free-party and my mates said it was like babysitting a hyperactive toddler but since have had stronger trips of a single blotter

				I would say close to 20 hits.<br /><br />I had a tolerance from tripping pretty hard a few days earlier but was selling so I had a stash. I ended up just eating ten strips like they were bubble gum lol.<br /><br />I remember hitting on an acquantance&#039;s girlfriend at the time and her asking me what was up and me responding by &quot;I&#039;m in outer space&quot;.<br /><br />Also remember watching houses wave while walking down the street. When I got home and dropped the half ounce of crippy I had just bought on the beareau the nugs all turned in to ants and ran away. I was like FUCK but when I blinked everything was where it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Good times.

				The most I&#039;ve done is ~600-700 mcg. The experience was heavily augmented by 120 mg of MDA, which made it less powerful than my previous ~500 mcg dose, while still appearing appropriately more intense. I didn&#039;t experience ego-death at any level up to or including the ~600-700 mcg.<br /><br />I look forward to when my situation allows for a 2 mg experience, which is only my next, not end, goal.

				all the stories here about eating so much blotter dots ... LSD, wow. <br /><br />But one little thing to mention. my hardest trip was on maybe 350-400µg and I dont want to be there again in the near future. But I had viles of L with 50 drops and one drop was enough to trip at the first night. 3-5 drops the second day, and &quot;drank&quot; the rest the 3rd day. So the title says &quot; Most LSD you had at once?&quot; but it should be &quot; Most LSD you had at once WITHOUT any tolerance?&quot;<br /><br />just my 2 ct.

				In the 90&#039;s, I had some friends who ran around with the dead heads so for about a year straight I was tripping and acid was pretty easy to get.&nbsp; I never did take anymore than a hit at a time and usually by the time it was wearing off, I was wishing it would. I tried taking hits one day then the next but it somehow didn&#039;t work as good so I started dropping every 3 or 4 days just a hit at a time and I enjoyed that. I like a variety of drugs too much to just trip off acid all the time. Acid takes over so if you want to do something different then you gotta wait to come down off the cid so you can actually feel the other drugs. Marijuana is the exception. I love to smoke a fatty while tripping. But taking pills? Forget about it. Some pills kick in after the acid has weakened like for example: artane

				I&#039;m sure someone already mentioned this but Lucy will find you &quot;when you&#039;re ready&quot; more or less independent of the dose.<br /><br />Having said that, the 3rd time I had Juergen&#039;s &quot;Mayas&quot; which were rated at somewhere between 250 and 300 my partner and I had the deepest trip we&#039;ve ever had,<br />I have always been a bit of a control freak and found it very hard to let go and &quot;lose myself&quot;, however the past weekend we both had an absolutely mind blowing experience on the 1 blotter.<br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll write up a full trip report soon, if only to solidify it in my mind for myself, but what I personally experienced even during the first 3 - 4 hours of this trip was nothing short of mind boggling and mind blowing. After seemingly being in another world and viewing life everywhere for hours, realising that the same music track is still playing and it&#039;s still in the &quot;break down&quot; part of amazing trance... that&#039;s what I call a trip!

				I&#039;m not going to get into to details, but me and a few friends went to a Flaming Lips show on NYE 2010-2011,they played a usual set, then at midnight they played their album &#039;The Soft Bulletin&#039; in its entirety for the first time live. i ate 3 hits of good LSD at the hotel, then an hour later in line i ate another 3 hits of weak LSD.<br /><br />The show went on from about 7-8p.m. to like 2-3 a.m.<br /><br />Easily one of the best nights of my life

				Res&#039;ing this great thread.<br /><br />i remember eating a few tabs of something back in the day, not sure if it was lsd as a friend who took it with me tripped for about 24 hours afterwards having some severe psychosis afterwards. he said he lost himself in space and time, realizing how grand the universe is but how tiny he was and how even tho neutrons and protons and electrons are some of the smallest particles, the importance of them and how they do tie into the universe is unbelievable...<br /><br />myself i was thrown into a world of pale sketches where life looked like a music video and stars in the sky were pulled out of their dark canopy, popping as the light from them dissapeared.

				approx 500 ug - but that is lab tested product 500 ug - not &quot;vendor said it was xxx but who knows how strong it really was&quot;.<br /><br />Dosage strength is frequently wildly exaggerated by vendors.<br /><br />500 ug was honestly more than I bargained for - at peak I pretty much felt like I blacked out or had a brain stroke. Very intense and quite a learning experience but not something I am eager to try again.<br /><br />Have found my sweet spot which will give real pleasant tripping with visuals, where the music crystalises, time stops and I have these profound insights that makes me return to acid is around 300 ug. Bit less if last trip is a month or more ago bit more if its only a week ago.<br /><br /><br />

				Back in the day on Dead Tour, I got &quot;blessed&quot;, which was when the cook would take their rubber glove and put it into a container of freshly made liquid L and grab your wrist as though they were checking for a knife and slide it down and shake your hand (&quot;strangers stopping strangers, just to shake their hand&quot;). After this happened I became cold, so cold if felt like I was in the north pole butt naked, when in reality it was 110 degrees in a sunny field at some festival. I took a few steps and the whole world just collasped as though mario just jumped on it. I was told I didn&#039;t move for a few hours after that and that I did eventually make it to the show later that night.... No distinct memory of the show, just a chaotic trip for a few days, but that&#039;s Dead Tour for ya!!!
