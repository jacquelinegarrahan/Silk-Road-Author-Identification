When I realized I was addicted, that scared the living shit out of me (never been addicted to any drugs before) and I flushed my whole stash, like 7 or 8 grams, down the toilet and threw out my bowl. Haven&#039;t touched any spice since.<br /><br />Also, it had a very strong disassociative effect on me, but I&#039;ve never really seen anybody else talk about that. Have you experienced this? I think I&#039;m going to make a new topic about this...

				Can&#039;t believe I forgot to mention 25i NBOMe. It makes music amazing. Try throwing on some Deep Purple or some Santana, it&#039;ll rock your world.

				I&#039;m going to add 4-MEC to the list because even though I didn&#039;t note any auditory enhancement, I could feel the music vibrating through every muscle in my body as I was dancing and that felt phenomenal...<br /><br />Has anyone had any experience with 6-APB? Does it have a similar effect with music as MDMA does?

				this may sound unusual but next time you do ketamine try putting on headphones and playing something....I did a few lines and started listening to bootsy collins, although at some points I did not notice it, it definitely had positive effects on my trip.

				Ketamine + certain types of music is just fantastic.&nbsp; I personally really enjoy a bit of ket while peaking on mdma or mda.&nbsp; But with ketamine alone, some good tunes can really take you to great places.&nbsp; I&#039;m partial to more down tempo psybient stuff while on ket ( Ott or Shpongle are some faves)
