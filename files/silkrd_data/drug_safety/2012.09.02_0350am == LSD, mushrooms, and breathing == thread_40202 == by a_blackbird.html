				this seemed like a good place to ask... i will probably ask my doctor the next time i see him, too, but i&#039;m curious what you folks have to say about it.<br /><br />i&#039;ve done lsd a handful of times... probably less than 10 overall in my lifetime.&nbsp; most recently was a few weeks ago, and prior to that, it had been 5 years.&nbsp; prior to that, about 7 years.&nbsp; as far as i know, aside from a little high cholesterol, i&#039;m healthy and in ok physical shape.&nbsp; at some point in the last 5 years i&#039;ve had shrooms once, although i don&#039;t remember exactly when.&nbsp; anyway, to the point... both on this most recent acid trip and my previous shrooming experience, i found it difficult to breathe (or at least i thought so) - it just seemed like i couldn&#039;t take a full inhalation - like i&#039;d go to take a breath and my lungs would get about 75% full and then feel tight and constricted.&nbsp; i also felt like (yeah, this is embarrassing) i had pissed myself, even though i felt around in the appropriate areas and obviously hadn&#039;t.&nbsp; being only an hour into the trip, i didn&#039;t really want another 10 hours of this shit, so i called an abort and hit the in-case-of-emergency xanax.&nbsp; 2mg and i&#039;m passed the fuck out.&nbsp; that stuff would stop a raging elephant.<br /><br />i wouldn&#039;t expect these sort of effects out of lsd or mushrooms.&nbsp; maybe meth, or coke, or something with a speedy element to it, sure, but not something purely psychedelic.&nbsp; does any of this shit happen to anyone else?&nbsp; is it all in my head?&nbsp; i tried doing some research and didn&#039;t really find anything too useful.&nbsp; before i completely swear off psychedelics for the rest of my life, i&#039;d like to at least have one last good experience, so any tips would be appreciated.

				i can relate, you&#039;re not alone on this one.<br /><br />healthy, not the most physically active anymore but i&#039;m very far from fat. i have asthma, but it&#039;s very very tamed compared to most. one time i took 5 hits of acid, (the most ive ever taken before) and i straight up blacked out. like could not function, for about three hours. what i remember the most besides rolling around on the hotel bed, fading in and out, was it was very, very difficult to breathe. i had shallow breathing, and my lungs felt very weak and my chest felt tight. thankfully, it calmed down and i was able to function for the last 6 hours of my trip. very horrific experience.

				I know what you are talking about. The first time I ingested cannabis, I got exactly the same feeling that you described RE breathing, almost leading to a panic attack, and I&#039;ve had the same thing happen with LSD. It stopped happening to me when I realised it was all in my head. <br /><br />It&#039;s normal for your body to feel different when tripping. With the heightened awareness of psychedelics, if you fixate your attention on your breathing,&nbsp; it&#039;s easy to conclude that you aren&#039;t breathing properly. Focus your attention on something else.

				Assuming that the experience you are describing is psychosomatic, and not the result of some kind of physical condition that is brought to the surface only under the influence of LSD, which I think is unlikely, you may want to consider practising yoga and meditation while tripping.<br /><br />I used to get bad trips all the time. They were usually triggered by a feeling that my body wasn&#039;t functioning properly. My attention seemed to be overly fixated on the internal sensations of the body, which you would expect to feel distorted during LSD inebbriation. I discovered that by doing some stretches, I could reliably prevent a bad trip from occurring the moment I saw it coming. I have since learned that stretching is a common and effective method of alleviating panic attacks. Ever since I started practicing yoga and meditation in conjunction with LSD and mushrooms, I&#039;ve never had a bad experience on psychedelics.

				there were a couple of times i felt some heaviness on my chest, slightly harder to breathe but that was on the comedown, the acid was good (150ug i guess) but not the cleanest

				Such are the dangers of taking hallucibens of any kind.<br /><br />A trip can give you the the idea that you cannot breath properly, while there is no real reason that would be the case at all - its just what hallucinating does sometimes ;)

				Never had the breathing thing, but I&#039;ve had the &#039;have I pissed myself?&#039; thing when smoking weed. I obviously haven&#039;t, but I put it down to different body feel and the mild psychedlia helping me convince myself this has happened when it hasn&#039;t. Sort of like phantom buzzing from your phone if you use it too often.<br /><br />Never really bothered me though, but of course actual psychedelics would be more intense so maybe that&#039;s why.
