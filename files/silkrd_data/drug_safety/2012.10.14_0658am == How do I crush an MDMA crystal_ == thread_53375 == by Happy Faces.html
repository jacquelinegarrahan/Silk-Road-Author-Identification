				depends on the size of the crystal. For smallish crystals simply put the crystal on a flat service like a table, get a credit card and while covering the front and back of the card, just simply push the card down till it crushes. Get another credit card to get every bit off the one you just used. Repeat this until the crystal is crushed enough for your liking.

				Thank you! However, the crystal I&#039;m dealing with is about a gram in size, so I think it is too large for a credit card.

				Perhaps a CD case then, or something similar.<br /><br />Just make sure you cover the front and back of whatever you push down with your hands as sometimes the original crush can send small pieces flying out. Just be careful and you wont lose any, just don&#039;t rush it&nbsp; 8)

				How about you just use something thats slightly heavier than the crystal you are trying to crush, that should do the trick.

				Place inside some form of cloth as to not loose product, and just crush on your table with something harder then the crystal (I use a table knife). It&#039;s not that hard&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah if I happen to come across a piece that happens to be about 100 mg, I just swallow it like a pill. It doesn&#039;t take long to dissolve at all. This of course is null and void if you are speaking of insuffalation.

				I cut crystals with a razer, requires a lot less pressure then a crush and doesn&#039;t send shards flying.<br />Just cut it a few times till they are reasonable size crystals then flip the razer on its side and crush away.

				I like to shave it, as if it were ice. Use something sharp or with a flat edge, such as a screwdriver or razor. This way you just get more of a shaving motion without all your product going everywhere from crushing it too hard.

				If you bought it on the road it was probably vacuum sealed so just put it in that thick plastic and crush it in that. I&#039;ve never had any issues with it coming through the bag or losing any. <br /><br />My buddy went to break a chunk once and it just fucking exploded everywhere. He didn&#039;t really think it through&nbsp; ???

				put the chunks inside a couple of rizlas, then press down with card. at least if you have weighed the crystal you are breaking, 200mgs for example its ready in the rizla to be swallowed.

I just finished up crushing up 2 grams MDMA crystals in my mortar and pestle. <br /><br />The ILF speaks the truth. In no time you crystals will be ultra fine powder. You can control the amount of grinding so if you don&#039;t want fine powder then you do grind as long.<br /><br />You can use it for a ton of things. You can even use it for grinding up herbs, Basil,Parsley .etc, for you cooking. <br /><br />Good luck.

				I recently had this dilemma and found this thread. So many ideas for such a nice dilemma to have! This is what worked well for me. A sharp blade with the rock on some tin foil then shave the rock with the blade. Nice fluffy flakes I then capped. Nom nom nom :P
