				So i&#039;ve tripped on 25i-nbome numerous times, and i&#039;m starting to get bad side effects, but i&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the drug or just my body. Every time i&#039;ve tripped i&#039;ve had an amazing experience, until last night. I experienced what I guess people refer to as ego death. My setting wasn&#039;t the greatest. I was with a friend who I am completely comfortable tripping around, and some new girl he has who i&#039;ve never met. She was completely bitchy and complaining the whole time about how hard I was tripping when she wasn&#039;t because she didn&#039;t even do it right... Either way, after an intense trip outside with those two, they decided to go to bed, but I couldn&#039;t. I was embarrassed and felt bad because it seemed like she was mad at my friend, and I guess I felt like I was to blame. Then I layed there thinking for hours... I started thinking I was doing everything wrong, and that&nbsp; I was a total screw up. I started piecing together hints of things people have said to me in the past, and think they were judging me. I started thinking of everything I could be doing better. It was honestly the scariest thing in my life and it shook me up pretty bad. I actually just gave one to my roomate a couple days before and he ended up going to the hospital for anxiety attacks and panic attacks. I&#039;ve noticed some odd things after I trip too. The time before this, my abdominal muscles or something in my stomach killed me for about a week. It seems like one eye is always blood shot after. My hair which usually curls has stopped and became really frizzy....My other friend says that he is having muscle spasms and his liver is inflamed. All in all I don&#039;t know if i&#039;ll do any drugs again, and definatly not for a while... That includes weed and alcohol..... I guess i&#039;m just looking for others who may have had bad trips before, and what you did to conquer the fear and anxiety. Thank you in advance for any advice.

				Yeah, take a break for a while maybe. It&#039;ll do you mentally and physically a lot of good. Also, about all the feelings and thoughts you had during the trip, think about what you can learn from it remembering that you *were* tripping and then move on - hopefully a better and more rounded person for it.<br /><br />If you then after a couple of months want to go tripping again, maybe try acid instead of the RCs again. The problem with the RCs are that they are so new that there&#039;s really no long-term knowledge about their effects (clinical or anecdotal). The &quot;oldies&quot; are &quot;goodies&quot; for a reason. Acid has been around since the sixties and people have pretty much figured out what it can and can&#039;t do to you.

Thank you in advance for any advice.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>When I think I&#039;m about to have a bad trip, I focus my attention on what I am directly experiencing at the present moment, instead of confusing my experience with some story the mind has created around it. I soon find that there is nothing in my immediate perceptions, however distorted, that is cause for fear or anxiety. Bad trips always seem to relate to something outside of direct experience, whether it be a thing in the past or future, a what-if scenario, an idea, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s never rooted in anything I&#039;m actually seeing, hearing, touching, etc.<br /><br />Listening to my favourite music during the coming-up phase helps ensure that I enter the trip in a good mental state.&nbsp; <br /><br />The practice of yoga (while tripping) has eliminated the somatic anxiety I would sometimes experience on psychedelics.<br /><br />It is also much more difficult to get out of a bad trip if I&#039;m in an overstimulating environment. The best setting for me is my own living room or backyard. <br />

				What concerns me the most are your physical side effects.<br /><br />Your trip sounds like a good trip though. 25i shows me reality. Reality isn&#039;t always pretty and you have to confront your ego and learn from it instead of living in a state of denial. It really helps you out in the long run.<br /><br />

				How many times have you taken 25i, what kind of spacing do you have between trips?<br />Your physical side effects sound worrying.

				I&#039;ve taken 25i-nbome twice now, and the second time I felt like my heart was going to explode, although I&#039;d only taken it just 10 days after the first one and it was twice the dose. For about a week afterwards my heart was beating really hard, and I wasn&#039;t sure if I should see a doctor and just make sure I was ok. I got over it pretty quick, and I enjoyed the experience a lot, however I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll risk taking it again.<br /><br />It definitely put a strain on my body. If you don&#039;t feel 100% confident in taking it, then don&#039;t. Plenty of other drugs to have a great time with.<br />

				Well I&#039;ve never had a bad trip but i did have the exact same thoughts day after tripping.<br />Never quit though, i want to have a blast while I&#039;m still young and enjoy life, my advice to you is take a break until you feel the need to get fucked up again, It may never come.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a friend who had a bad trip on acid, didn&#039;t talk for the next day at all and stopped using drugs, not even weed.<br />I have no idea what happened to him but he wont touch anything except alcohol, but who knows, it may be only temporary, just take a break and see how things go.<br />Good luck mate :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

I had quite an outbreak of eye-twitch earlier this year, but can&#039;t remember if it was before, after or in the middle of a couple of 25I trips. It started in the eyelid but moved on to various muscles probably over a couple of weeks period, but the frequency and amplitude have gone way down since. Had another trip recently and it did not re-trigger it or anything.

				The physical effects sound a bit suspect, this is what can happen with rc&#039;s though.<br />I&#039;ve been in your situation before after &quot;bad&quot; trips, once you realise what it taught you then you can come away with a positive experience.<br />

				Thank You everybody for reassuring me that i&#039;m okay. I&#039;m actually already feeling alot better. As for the questions about how often and how much, I usually trip once every two weeks, sometimes I only wait a week. My usual dosage is two tabs of 1mg each. I think what i&#039;ve gotten out of it is that I just need to wait longer between trips. The only reason I do these instead of acid is the price, but if I trip less often, I guess I could afford the acid. Is it much better than 25i? I&#039;ve taken it before and it didn&#039;t do much to me... I took two hits, I forget the dosage but didn&#039;t get much out of it. A lot of thinking but not many visuals... Who is a good vendor for acid? Preferrably in the US. How much should I take if I want to get some visual aspects out of it? Also what did you mean by the lite beer of nbomes?

Acid tends to depend on the person, most people get light visuals at around 120-150 with a full blown experience at around 200-250. although if you are after crazy visuals you may want to try DMT, that shit is cray cray. and its pretty cheap.

				The potential body risks are why I stick to LSD, sure it costs more, but your health is worth it. If you want good acid domestically you could try one of the resellers who vend 3jane&#039;s or albions work. Or just buy in bulk from them.

				That sounds scary dude.&nbsp; I think I really understand what you went through because I had a really terrifying experience a few weeks ago too.<br /><br /><br />I had what I can only describe as a panic attack/psychotic break from taking 2 1mg 25i tabs.&nbsp; I had tripped on 25i twice prior to that, however, that was with duderugs tabs.&nbsp; This time I used foxy&#039;s tabs.&nbsp; As I thought i&#039;d found a sweet spot at 2mg total for me from duderugs (with a third tab later to extend it), I thought i&#039;d be fine top start off with 2mg of foxy&#039;s tabs. BIG MISTAKE.<br /><br />The setting could have been better. Me and about 5 or 6 friends were visiting another friend of a friend to try out his new volcano vapouriser.&nbsp; Now I didn&#039;t know the guy, but I knew everyone else, and it&#039;s a pretty relaxed set of people.<br />I was, however, the only one tripping, and it was a casual sit around and vape while watching the olympics type night.&nbsp; He had an amazing balcony view of the bridge and city lights. <br /><br />Anyway, onto the panic attack/bad trip.....<br />I have a massive weed tolerance, so I&#039;m not sure how much the vapour comes into it, but I had a couple of bags of vapour.&nbsp; After 45 mins of taking the tabs under my top lip I was coming up hard. Textures were crawling, and slight tracers. Energy was building up inside me really strong.&nbsp; I felt so light and energised that I ended up running up and down the long balcony in sheer excitement that I felt weightless.&nbsp; There was this force inside me that just made me run around absolutely giddy.&nbsp; Thoughts about life and the universe were racing through my head at the same time.&nbsp; I was getting a sense of colours from people around me.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, everything is really intense at this point, but as least i&#039;m loving it....<br />2 minutes later someone offers me something called &quot;salty ginger&quot;, which is some kind of chinese herbal remedy/snack/who knows. So I decided to try some. For some reason, my brain didn&#039;t compute what it really was, and I thought it might have been a sardine, or something more disgusting or whatever. At this point I felt a bit uncomfortable, but I thought it had stuck in my throat.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t really stuck in my throat though, it was just that I was more sensitive to my airways from the nbome, and due to smoking a fair bit, they felt quite unhealthy.&nbsp; You know when you have phlegm stuck in your throat??&nbsp; <br /><br />Cue me thinking i&#039;m dying and that these are my last moments on earth.<br />I thought that I was dying right then and there.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t feel myself dying, but I just thought my airway was blocked (even though I was still breathing fine).&nbsp; As i&#039;m freaking out like I never have before, a couple of my friends try to calm me down.&nbsp; It took a good while. for about 30 minutes I was stuck in a terrifying looping imminent death thought pattern.&nbsp; <br />You forget/never really know just how intense it is to think that you&#039;re about to leave this earth.<br />I&#039;m not a religious person, but I was having racing thoughts about god, hoping I go somewhere good at least, thoughts about my family, thoughts about how i&#039;d &quot;finally gone too far&quot; and that 2mgs of 25i would be known as the cause of my death.&nbsp; I thought i&#039;d broken my mind and that I couldn&#039;t breathe and that I was dying.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never felt such fear before.<br />Anyway, after about 30 mins of my friends trying to calmly talk about familiar topics, such as band practice that we had the next day I calmed down slowly, to the point where I just snapped out of it.<br />By that point the damage had been done, and I was so embarrassed and spent a long time reflecting on it the following week.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve since tripped twice on 25c and 25d respectively, and they didn&#039;t have anywhere near the amount of overstimulating and racing thoughts, or even visuals (though maybe tolerance?) that 25i had.<br /><br />Anyway, the lesson i&#039;ve learned is, even if you&#039;re familiar with a certain dosage of a research chemical DO NOT assume that the purported dose from one vendor will be the same as another vendor.&nbsp; Also, don&#039;t chew or eat anything during the peak.&nbsp; It seems this stuff can put you in a state where you&#039;re one step away from the most amazing euphoria, and also one step away from being terrified to your core.<br /><br />Start small, set and setting really IS as important as everyone says it is.&nbsp; I learned the hard way.

				Oh, and yeah, i&#039;ll add that I feel these don&#039;t feel all that physically safe.&nbsp; I will certainly finish my stash, cause I can tell you they&#039;re good strong hits of 25i.&nbsp; The problem seems to be that you can&#039;t push the dosage too fair with 25i.&nbsp; This is something I would like to work up to... to experience the intricate CEV for hours on end.&nbsp; I think high doses of acid 400ugs maybe?&nbsp; This might be good to work up to.&nbsp; As for the nbomes, i&#039;d be too scared to ever take MORE than 2mg on blotter, and next time I do i&#039;m going to plan it out a lot before.<br />3Jane&#039;s acid is starting to look better than ever!

				Careful guys. DudeRugs apparently had some weak batches. I took 1mg from Kwiktrip and it was INTENSE. It was one of the most revealing trips of my life. I can imagine 2mg would just be ridiculous and the side effects would increase. I&#039;m a psychonaut and I love pushing the limits with LSD but I don&#039;t feel the same urge with research chemicals.<br /><br />Also, I think I know what you mean about your airways but I experienced it with 2c-i. I wasn&#039;t tripping as hard but I was trying to puke for about 2 hours because I felt like there was something in my throat. I think you&#039;re just more aware of your body. Something as silly as phlegm, or food in your case can make you come to illogical conclusions. I&#039;ve noticed 25i can be give you beautiful real-izations, but also delusions.

				Hey 4evertaken, glad you&#039;re feeling better, did you take Mito&#039;s advice by any chance?&nbsp; :) You will be fine, I&#039;ve been doing substances for a long time and had some bizarre and unwelcome symptoms that have persisted long past the point I would&#039;ve liked, but that&#039;s the trade off. Only you can decide what&#039;s best for you. I do reckon that if you are going to keep doing drugs, that you go with what&#039;s been around for a while as has been said here by other posters. Might be worth acquainting yourself with some of the old gurus if you haven&#039;t already, I find Terence Mckenna and Alexander Shulgin to be comforting presences if things have got a bit fucked up.

My usual dosage is two tabs of 1mg each. I think what i&#039;ve gotten out of it is that I just need to wait longer between trips. The only reason I do these instead of acid is the price, but if I trip less often, I guess I could afford the acid. Is it much better than 25i? I&#039;ve taken it before and it didn&#039;t do much to me... I took two hits, I forget the dosage but didn&#039;t get much out of it. A lot of thinking but not many visuals... Who is a good vendor for acid? Preferrably in the US. How much should I take if I want to get some visual aspects out of it? Also what did you mean by the lite beer of nbomes?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hi 4evertaken, im glad you are feeling better, yeah acid is so much better than 25i, but its can be a struggle to find real acid so maybe the 2hits you tried just were not real acid, true acid is tasteless so thats a big clue when you take it, you want to put the tabs print side up on the roof of your mouth and leave it there for 30minutes or so to make sure its all been absorbed, some people then chew the paper and swallow it, i dont i just throw it away as i struggle to keep them in my mouth cos having anything in my mouth makes me reich, especially when its paper, im not sure about us vendors but enter the matrix sends worldwide and has some really good reviews on his acid, i am awaiting a package from fartbomber he has his acid lab tested in the netherlands so you always know what your getting, have a good read of the lsd review board and maybe ask there where to go for acid in the states, there are some really nice people there and they are more than willing to help people out. good luck and report back after you try real acid, i think you will be amazed and you will never look back at 25i again.&nbsp; ;)

				Just sounds like drug induced paranoia man, don&#039;t take anything that you think when fucked up on drugs too seriously, especially on a bad trip. Also 25i is just a research chemical and wasn&#039;t made for human consumption recreationally so don&#039;t sound too surprised when you abuse the chemical and have negative effects.

				i have had similar side effects from 25i-NBOMe. people in here saying &quot;nbome doesn&#039;t do this to people&quot; are too confident. this drug has only recently been discovered. several chemicals which are similar structurally can cause permanent brain damage and death instead of hallucinogenic effects. it is hard to say whether research chemicals are harmful or not, as they have not even been tested on animals. most of the people claiming NBOMe&#039;s are completely safe probably haven&#039;t done them many times. if you want to read my full experiences, including the overdose of a friend resulting in hospitalization from an average dose, go to the stickied nbome thread. if you want the summary, here goes. 25i-NBOMe had amazing effects for me for the first 20 times i took it. the more i did it, however, the more i noticed intense insomnia and somewhat psychotic feelings of paranoia and what i can only describe as &quot;emotional muting&quot; at the end of the trip. the amazing psychedelic energy during the peak yielded to the polar opposite of this effect at the end. i felt mentally weak and unable to complete even basic logical equations (i am a physics major so this is quite disconcerting) until i woke up the next morning. of course, i also experienced side effects throughout including severe vasoconstriction, reddening of the face, sweating, abdominal discomfort, genital constriction, and strange behavior of my hair. the reason i decided to post in this thread is actually because you are the first person besides myself to report flattening of the hair. none of my friends noticed this in themselves. anyways, these effects persisted for a few trips until, regrettably, i decided to trip on a large tab of 25i-NBOMe, about 1.5mg. the visuals were incredibly intense, causing DMT flashbacks, which was pleasant until i saw an acquaintance at the party begin to overdose. he had taken two tabs, so had ingested about 3mg. he had severe facial reddening, veins pulsating, sweating, foaming at the mouth, and complete psychotic behavior. he was unable to respond except saying the names of the people he was looking at. long story short, he had to go to the hospital because he was completely nonresponsive and his heart rate was incredibly elevated. the vasoconstrictive properties alone seem to be very dangerous to SOME people. i guess the reason i&#039;m posting this is that some drugs appear to affect different people in very different ways. i have seen a friend take 5 tabs of NBOMe and have no facial reddening at all. i get reddening from just one tab. it is very disturbing to me. i have chosen never to do NBOMe again after 2 repeats of the same trips with horrible side effects. it seems that the more you do this drug, the more severe the side effects become. i am very experienced with all kinds of psychedelics, and it is only after taking 25i-NBOMe that i have experienced long-term HPPD and depersonalization. i am happy to say that after abstaining from 25i for 2 months, these symptoms are gone, and my hair sure stands up straight again. i know worrying will have no effect, but i can&#039;t help but feel that i may have caused some kind of permanent change in the serotonin pathways of my brain. we must remember that serotonin transmission controls all kinds of physiological processes as well as psychedelic processes. if this weren&#039;t so, we wouldn&#039;t experience so many physical side effects. i am positive that my physiological effects were a result of the sheer number of times i have done high-dose NBOMe, as i did not experience these effects the first few times, with the exception of facial reddening which has happened every time. funny, you can always tell someone&#039;s on NBOMe because their face will be red and their muscles will look like they&#039;re popping out of the person&#039;s skin. anyway, i&#039;m sure some people can use this drug with no negative side effects, but it seems there is a population with exaggerated sensitivity to the side effects. if you want my advice, i would recommend not doing it again; i thought the side effects were a one time thing, so i tried it again a month later with a tab from another batch. the side effects were even WORSE this time. and for some reason, stupidly i thought maybe it&#039;d be okay in another month with another batch. side effects were at breaking point. i nearly committed suicide for fear that i had permanently damaged my brain. if you read my post in the nbome thread, you will see that some basic concepts such as language became almost completely unknown to me for the duration of the comedown. i could not sleep for over 24 hours, but when i finally slept i was okay. i would also like to say that now, after these experiences with NBOMe, LSD visuals have begun to resemble NBOMe visuals, which cause me anxiety perhaps as a result of my association between the visuals and the side effects. i do not mean to scare anyone, only to inform you that you are not alone in being adversely, physically affected by this drug! don&#039;t let anyone tell you that your symptoms are psychosomatic... if they were, you&#039;d experience these kinds of symptoms on any powerful psychedelic.

				After tripping 12 times on NBOME&#039;s (4 times on 25I: 500+250ug on March 31, 1mg on April 26, 2mg on April 27;&nbsp; 500ug in May some time; 6 times on 25C: 600ug on July 31, 150ug on August 15?; 750ug on 1 September, 1,1mg on 2 September, 375ug and 750ug when I got back to baseline on 15 September; 2 times on 25D: 1mg on August 31 and 1.5mg on August 31 into September 1), I&#039;d like to give a general review of my experiences.<br /><br />I felt depersonalized or derealized for about a month after taking 25I for the first time.&nbsp; The first trip was paranoia-inducing, dysphoric, confusing, and had a bad bodyload.&nbsp; 1mg was incredibly disappointing in terms of visuals and the mental space was dysphoric and introspective.&nbsp; The bodyload was even worse.&nbsp; My brain felt incredibly fried and my personality felt reset after I took 2mg.&nbsp; That trip had barely any visuals, an even worse, more awful bodyload, and the worst confusion I&#039;ve ever experienced.&nbsp; 2 of my friends were having a fun tripping time, even if the trips were weird.&nbsp; 1 of those friends had a seizure 2 days after taking 2mg.&nbsp; 1 friend was incredibly disappointed because there were barely any visuals on 1mg.&nbsp; 2 friends became very confused such as I did.&nbsp; Being alone in a room felt like a sanity test I was about to fail on 2mg.&nbsp; 1 stupid friend greatly enjoyed 25I, but he just saw brighter lights on 1mg.&nbsp; 500ug was uplifting but slightly confusing.&nbsp; I had minor HPPD involving a flickering effect in the solid blue sky and minor visual snow after taking 2mg.<br /><br />25C was incredible at 600ug, if a little overwhelming since it was my first good trip in my whole life.&nbsp; The trip was characterized with objects having halos, rainbow halos, light turning into waving rainbows, and interesting textures getting the patterning depth of a fractal.&nbsp; Everyone enjoyed it, aside from 1 friend who smoked blunts at the plateau while barely tripping from a 1/2 tab, and did not like the trip at all, but enjoyed it greatly after taking 1 tab sober.&nbsp; 150ug was like a light version of rolling.&nbsp; 750ug with tolerance after tripping twice the day before was about half as powerful as it should have been.&nbsp; 1.1mg the next day was as powerful as 187.5 ug (1/4 tab) with no tolerance.&nbsp; 375ug was a nice, enjoyable, light trip.&nbsp; 750ug later on in the same day was stronger and very fun.&nbsp; Overall a great chemical, but not very interesting.&nbsp; The trips are all very similar.&nbsp; After the first 25C trip, my HPPD from 25I was greatly diminished, and hasn&#039;t come back.&nbsp; A new HPPD has replaced it, where I see intricate but badly defined shapes when I close my eyes or in complete darkness, which isn&#039;t bad at all.<br /><br />25D is a mystical, magical molecule which I can&#039;t summarize yet, but both experience were beautiful for my friend and I.&nbsp; It has the friendly mindspace of acid, the visuals of mescaline, and the body feeling of MDMA.&nbsp; It&#039;s perfect.<br /><br />My lower-left abdominal region, too, is hurting occasionally, but it only started after I got sick, so I attributed it to that.&nbsp; It may also be an enlarged liver from taking NBOME&#039;s.&nbsp; Who knows?<br /><br />Avoid 25I, PLEASE!

				although psychedelics in general have a popular image as being safe as long as the mindset and setting are ideal, i am quite certain that 25i-NBOMe does not fit into this description. for me, the side effects of 25i are vastly different from traditional psychedelics. they are also lasting and somewhat debilitating. i cannot stress enough that repeated use of this drug caused me long-lasting side effects, both mental and physical. although you might argue that the mental effects were a result of a psychologically traumatic experience i had while on 25i, the physical effects are definitely an effect of the chemical, or a chain of events initiated by the chemical, itself. the physical effects also became progressively worse the more times i tried the substance.

				Hmm that is weird since psychedelics are usually very safe physical wise. But then again these nbome drugs are really new and we don&#039;t really know that much about them. Fuck that I will try them when people know more about them lol.

				I would also like to warn anyone against taking the NBOME compounds.&nbsp; That drug is the crack of the psychedelic world(though crack is more likely safer). <br /><br />I got a few doses months back, a 500 ug complexed blotter.&nbsp; I took one whole blotter, had a very empty lightly visual trip.&nbsp; One thing i did notice was sharp pains shooting into parts of my body every so often, such as my legs, and my heart area.<br /><br />every so often i would also feel a pain in my heart area, and sharp but slight pains in my leg or parts of my arm.&nbsp; &nbsp;i also tried about half that dose, and noticed very slight elements of pain that where way more pronounced on heavier doses.<br /><br />the heachaches after using this drug made me feel as if it is very excitotoxic and has the potential cause brain and nerve damage.<br /><br />I got the nbome because i thought it may be somewhat like acid.. but it&#039;s absolutely not spiritual.&nbsp; anyone who compares this to acid know nothing about acid.&nbsp; from what i understand, the nbome was designed to flood your body with serotogenic neurotransmitters so serotonin pathways could be mapped. now that i think, side effects of this could be varying aspects of serototogenic syndrome. be careful.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It seems this stuff can put you in a state where you&#039;re one step away from the most amazing euphoria, and also one step away from being terrified to your core.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s exactly how I felt at the end of my 2C-I trip. I know 2CXs are not NBOMEs, but the sensation of going from rolling euphoria and trippiness to sudden confusion, panic, dysphoria, time loop, and near ego death was something I can relate to. It&#039;s like you suddenly become aware of your own thoughts and turn your brain inside out. Anything that you were hiding from yourself is transported to the surface and you have to deal with it right then and there, when you really aren&#039;t in the state of mind to do so.<br /><br />Personally, I think that many of these symptoms are just the after effects of living through a traumatic experience. My 2C-I freakout was up there with the scariest moments of my life, including moments where I nearly died from imminent physical danger. It&#039;s like the internal fear of going crazy and never returning to &quot;you&quot; is worse than anything you might experience physically. From what I&#039;ve read so far, those of you with bad 25i experiences were also scared shitless, and rightfully so! Is it possible that the effects you&#039;re feeling are from the sudden, massive surge of adrenaline, cortisol, etc? In my case, the lingering agitation, inability to fully relax, and constant need to focus on my own thoughts lingered for about 5-6 days after. I was convinced I triggered some kind of latent schizophrenia (no family history, not in my early 20s, never lost touch with reality or connected unrelated events) and kept reading about it until I was sure that diagnosis didn&#039;t fit. About the only physical effect from 2C-I that lingered on was an obvious boost in metabolism, and even that faded with every passing day.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever had anxiety, depression, and/or OCD-like symptoms then you are already familiar with thought loops. Ever had a bad weed high where you couldn&#039;t stop thinking about negative shit? That&#039;s your fear of losing control (losing loved ones, getting arrested, etc) manifesting itself. As long as you are always 100% aware that the intrusive thoughts in your head are false, you are not &quot;going insane&quot; at all. Lots of people experience this, and if you happen to be tripping balls, the &quot;bad high&quot; effect is going to be a thousand times worse. Remember, the drug is in control of your mind during this time. The fact that you were even able to realize this and release a massive dose of adrenaline in order to try and fight the trip kind of confirms your sanity. <br /><br />I would advise everyone here to go the the doctor and get some blood work done. Make sure they check your nutrition, especially vitamin and mineral levels. Also, if you ever felt symptoms of fatigue and a mild cold that never quite went away, get them to check for latent EBV and HCMV infections. These two viruses aren&#039;t just responsible for mononucleosis, but a host of chronic health problems and cognitive difficulties that are nigh impossible to diagnose properly these days. This is not some new age, homeopathic crap I&#039;m trying to sell you for a low, low price of $19.99. I&#039;m telling you, get that shit checked out. Pay for it out of pocket if you have no insurance; lab tests are a cheap diagnostic tool that can detect most obvious health problems. The OCD and anxiety commonly associated with bad trips can be as simple as an easily treatable nutritional deficit.

				i absolutely hate NboMe and its not a decision i made straight away, i have tried it on 15 different occasions in all sorts of settings and there is no way this can be compared to acid, this stuff affects me differently every time i take it. some times have been nice and relaxed and others have been full on in my face, it makes me sick 9 times out of 10 and keeps me away until the early hours long long after its effects have worm off. then i ache for days after taking it, im not sure its safe and i threw the last 5caps i had away after taking it again friday night and i regretted taking it from the moment i took it. nasty nasty stuff im sticking to stooms and acid and strooms win that one&nbsp; ;)&nbsp;

				So while reading around on bluelight I happened to find a pretty indepth post on 25i nbome and other psychadelics in terms of what receptor sites they antagonize<br />the whole post can be found here: (clearnet) http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/551797-The-Big-amp-Dandy-25I-NBOMe-Thread/page23&nbsp; &nbsp;reply #557<br /><br />exerpts relevant to this topic: <br /><br />&quot;If there is anything I learned dosage wise, it&#039;s that I need to increase the dosage of the 25i with the additions of the 300mg of mescaline in the future (to levels around 550ug to 600ug), perhaps even increasing the mescaline to 350mg in combination as well. The blood pressure reducing effects from the 5-HT1 agonism provided by the mescaline also counteract the 5-HT2A stimulating agonism provided by the 25i, so it&#039;s all very good in combo, yin &amp; yang. The 5-HT1 agonism from the mescaline also contributes a beautiful calm introspective laid-back meditative state to the entire trip. For example: &quot;Buspar&quot; is a common 5-HT1 medically created agonist with meditative and calming properties, these calming effects added to a 25i trip are very strong with the addition of the potent 5-HT1A &amp; 5-HT1E psychedelic agonist mescaline. LSD &amp; psilocin are also very strong 5-HT1 agonist, even stronger in this regards then it&#039;s 5-HT2A agonism.<br /><br />[note] 25i with (very low dose) 4-aco-dmt, the reports I read indicate it has spiritual, trancelike/sedative activity, and the receptor data for psilocin (closely related) shows it is a potent 5-HT1 agonist and even potent dopamine agonist, this will fare very well in combination with 25i, adding to it just what it needs, the missing 5-HT1/dopamine agonism.&quot;<br /><br />- In short 25i is best when combined with a potent 5-HT1 antagonist <br /><br />&quot;5-HT1 agonist &quot;shut off serotonin firing&quot; which appears imho to be an important contribution to the psychedelic state, else one becomes consumed in obsessive compulsive thought patterns, inattention and a tendency to hyperactivity when they could rather be engrossed in the meditative mind-manifesting thought process of a full-spectrum psychedelic.&quot;<br /><br />25i agonizes the following receptors [the lower the number, the greater the affinity]<br />5-HT2A (0.044), 5-HT2C (2), 5-HT6 (73), 5-HT2B (231), u opiate (82), kappa opiate [288]<br /><br />List of potent 5-HT1 agonists to follow.<br />

				I&#039;ve tripped on 25i 3 times now (including one really scary experience I previously posted in this thread), 25d once, and 25c twice.<br />2mg of 25i was psychologically horrifying for a short intense period during the trip. Euphoria turned to dysphoria and confusion very quickly.<br />I&#039;ve since tripped on the 25d and 25 c a couple of times, and had a milder, yet still enjoyable time.<br /><br />I have a new worry though! I had 1650ugs sublingual 25c on the weekend.&nbsp; I was having a great time with the colours and visuals, although they were mild (tolerance build up is likely), when after the peak started to subside I was met with a very uncomfortable and worrying feeling of pins and needles in my hands and fingers.&nbsp; It got to the point where I was petting my friends cat (actually as a way to try to calm myself down) and I couldn&#039;t feel it&#039;s fur.&nbsp; I found out what vasoconstriction felt like, and it was coupled with an intense nervous cracked out feeling, kind of like uncomfortable adrenalin, for lack of a better description.&nbsp; It was just not being able to feel my hands for a period while not being able to feel myself breathe (even though I was with it enough to know I was breathing).&nbsp; Then the psychological response in that mindset was to start panicking.&nbsp; Luckily I managed to calm myself down before things got too far.&nbsp; I do think that perhaps I can attribute my success in staying calm to the experience I gained from the bad 25i trip.&nbsp; I ran my hands under some hot water and exercised them for the next 6 hours until I could sleep.&nbsp; When I woke up after 4 hours the vasoconstriction had completely gone, which was a big relief, as I was afraid they&#039;d turn blue if I didn&#039;t keep an eye on them (the psychological effects of the drug more than anything).&nbsp; Also, I think i&#039;ve realised that in my previous bad trip, where I thought I was dying, I can trace the initial panic to thinking i wasn&#039;t breathing, and therefore must of been choking on something i&#039;d put in my mouth a couple of mins earlier in my mind).&nbsp; This is vasoconstriction in the neck, most likely it seems.<br /><br />So, my current opinion on nbomes in general is that they are a lot of fun, but DO NOT push it.&nbsp; You&#039;d be surprised how much you think you can handle as a drug user/tripper with lots of previous drug experience, that you might not be able to handle at all on NBOME.&nbsp; I mean, on acid if you&#039;re having a bad trip at least you can take comfort in knowing you&#039;re probably gonna be alright.&nbsp; A bad trip on NBOME is probably worse because it&#039;s negative effects, physically and psychologically play off each other, and it&#039;s so much worse because in that moment you realise there probably is real danger, and it&#039;s hard not to freak out.<br /><br />I will only lower my future doses slightly, and trip less often I think.&nbsp; I&#039;m certainly not going to take over 2mg of 25i, not matter what the set or setting, and no more than about 1.5mg of 25c.&nbsp; 25d is weaker, so I might wait a few months and just try the same chilled out 2mg&nbsp; dose and see if that&#039;s stronger without tolerance.&nbsp; If not, then I may try 2.5mg of 25d.&nbsp; NBOMEs can be crazy intense.

				ive only ever tried 25i and 25c but id tell others not to try these chemicals, they are unpredictable at best, i have had some nice relaxed chilled evenings with 25i but other times on the same dose ive been overwhelmed and actually wish i didnt bother taking it. there are so many other great psychedelics out there like lsd or more natural ones like mushrooms id stay with the known ones if you are thinking of nbome, i know its cheap as chips and legal but there is no real way of knowing the long term effects, the reports im reading are more than worrying me, pins and needles and thoughts of dieing are not good no matter how you try and dress it up saying it was the setting or what ever, its the drug you are taking and in my view nbome is bad news, stick to acid we know there are no long term effects from taking it, the question you should ask yourself is &quot;is it worth the risk of taking these unknown substances just because it costs less or its legal&quot; i think not and i hope the time i spent experimenting with it dont come back to haunt me.&nbsp; &nbsp;
