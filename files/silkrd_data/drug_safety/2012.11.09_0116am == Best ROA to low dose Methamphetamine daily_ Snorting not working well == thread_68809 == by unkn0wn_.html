				I&#039;ve been low dosing (10mg) of methamphetamine for the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />It&#039;s my first exposure to meth and I&#039;m not interested in taking higher amounts, since my intended goal is to improve my attention and productivity (which it has been very helpful with).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been snorting a small line in the morning, but I&#039;m not a fan of this ROA because I live in a cold climate, so I often have congestion. I&#039;ve noticed I have to take more than usual when my nose is running. I don&#039;t like the idea of taking more than 10mg.<br /><br />Is there a better way to dose this than by snorting?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried smoking it yet. Are the effects any different?<br /><br />Also, can I use empty pills to take it orally?

				I find adderall and dexedrine to be superior when it comes to motivation and attention-focusing.&nbsp; Taking meth in any way other than swallowing small chips is going to be too much of a fast ride up and a similarly fast fall back down -- meth will definitely give you some of the beneficial effects of pharmaceutical ADHD drugs though.&nbsp; Just have to try and get the purest stuff you can find.&nbsp; And it doesn&#039;t work quite as well... with a 20mg adderall going for $15.00 easy though, it&#039;s not a bad alternative.<br /><br />Modafinil is definitely not going to be as helpful as it seems you&#039;re looking for something to be (otherwise why would you be taking some of the most powerful stimulants the world has ever seen to help you study).&nbsp; Modafinil mostly keeps you awake and alert like caffeine.&nbsp; Some people find it&#039;s helpful for concentration, but so is a good strong cup of coffee... I guess it&#039;s worth trying to see if it works well for you though, since there&#039;s no getting around how habit forming amphetamines are.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been hooked since I started taking them quite a long time ago. It isn&#039;t even really the pleasure of them. Half of what I&#039;m addicted to is their mental enhancing effect.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to scare you off them, just pointing out Twelve_Pickles is right when he says it&#039;s habit forming.&nbsp; And you don&#039;t have to be after a good time with them to get hooked.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t: just wanted to think better.<br /><br />(no, I don&#039;t regret using them, if you&#039;re curious -- I&#039;d do it all again)

				Yeah, and I agree, it&#039;s worth trying to see if it gets the job done. I&#039;ve just given up on finding anything that works even half as well as amphetamines, personally, so it&#039;s hard not to be pretty pessimistic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried damn near everything -- there&#039;s just no molecule like &#039;em :)

				Smoking it tends to cloud up your mind more than being focused. Smokers achieve the least amount of tasks compared to other users methods... it would be counter productive if you were to smoke&nbsp; meth, for the reasons you use it.<br />&nbsp; Eating it- either in some water or soda, or inside a gel cap&nbsp; would be more advisable- <br />theres other methods of course , but im no athority on those- except for using it with DMSO&nbsp; which was a disappointment.<br /><br />Ritalin might be better suited for your purposes, maybe even ephedrine pills ( if available in your area.)<br /><br />I have Narcolepsy also and I back what Poolsclosed said- expensive, gives you the creeps.

				Eesh, two of you saying so?&nbsp; Well that&#039;s a bummer. I knew they were mild, and even though every stim sucks compared to amphetamines, I love trying new ones.&nbsp; Was gonna buy a few one day and see what happened when I popped &#039;em -- suppose I won&#039;t bother though :(

Modafinil has its place for shift work sleep disorder - it, like caffeine, reprograms the brain and tells it when wake-time is. I take one of my old Provigils from time to time to get my sleep schedule back on track, much like one would use melatonin from time to time. But it&#039;s a very new drug and it&#039;s not well understood and it has some weird mental effects, like I said, so it&#039;s not helpful for those suffering from ADD.<br /><br />I will go with what mrguymann said on Ritalin. You may find methylphenidate works for you. Although I wouldn&#039;t bother with ephedrine; that&#039;s more of a peripheral nervous system stimulant and it&#039;s great for dieting but I wouldn&#039;t use it to study.<br /><br />Oral ROA while you still have the meth might work pretty well.

				What is the daily dose taken? Meth generally hits harder and faster than other amphetamines, taking it orally after a meal will result in the slowest release.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest halving the dosage, taking half in the morning after breakfast, then half in the day after lunch.<br /><br />Experiment with all different ROA&#039;s to find the one that suits your needs best.&nbsp; Snorting is the worst way to take meth for therapeutic reasons.&nbsp; As far as ROA&#039;s go, snorting and injecting are the ones with the highest risk of future abuse/addiction.&nbsp; The method of taking the drug is a huge part of the psychological addiction. Taking it in a way that is easy and efficient has the least impact and therefore, less chance that it will turn into abuse of said drug.

Don&#039;t take drugs, including amphetamines, on a full stomach. Take them on an empty stomach, with antacids, to reduce waste. (At least, that&#039;s my two sents on amines.)

				Please stop doing this IMMEDIATELY! i cant stress this enough. you will get addicted no matter how small of a dose you take every day. Mark my words: you will increase your dosage if you continue and it will be the worst thing that ever happened to you.

				Yea you can eat it in any way you want. Put it in a capsule or put some chunks in your mouth and wash it down with a drink. It takes a little longer to start working but it also last longer. You will not find a suitable replacement for crystal meth and you can believe that

				I know of friends that have taken meth on a daily/weekly basis to get through study and awaken the creative mind, and both of them never became addicted. Addiction varies so much from person to person. Be safe and keep your vibration happy :)<br /><br />For your purpose I would suggest dissolving your dose in a small amount of water. Consume on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Try not to get to far into smoking meth, it f**ks with your physiology hard (respiratory problems, liver/kidney function, teeth degradation, cellular damage etc).<br /><br />You may also enjoy pure ephedrine tablets/caps.<br /><br />Remember to drink plenty of water (regardless of whether you&#039;re taking drugs or not) and keep some nice organic fruit handy on a daily basis. Organic fruit/food in general was my saviour over the years :)<br /><br />Be well

				If you&#039;re ... &#039;silly&#039; enough to use Meth as a means to focus/study/energy/establish a habit slowly that will destroy your life then you might want to give buccal ROA a shot.<br /><br />I have no idea what the bioavailability is when used buccally, but presumably would be similar to insufflation.&nbsp; Either way, it&#039;s not my intention to try and help you anyways cuz you&#039;re ... wow a fool ... but buccal is one ROA to consider :)

				You naysayers must not be aware that methamphetamine is a prescription drug. It&#039;s marketed as Desoxyn in the states. At sub-neurotoxic doses, it&#039;s a great ADD and narcolepsy drug. The sticky on methamphetamine use is full of good information on keeping yourself safe while using it (and stimulants in general).

				Thanks for the help everyone, I intend to purchase dextroamphetamine and try that out as an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased gelatin capsules and have been using this ROA instead of snorting for the last several days. It definitely has a slower onset and longer duration, without the quick boost. Which is perfect. I&#039;ll try mixing it with water as well.<br /><br />I also recently read a study that showed the effects of ROA on addiction and capsules is the way to go (smoking/injection is the worst, snorting is mid-range). This is why some health centers hand out free capsules to prevent users from injections.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the original post I take 10mg and I&#039;m very strict with my dosage. I take at least 2 days each week off to balance tolerance.<br /><br />Also regarding abuse, I believe strongly in moderation since taking university courses in pharmacology, pathology and addiction. We live in a culture that views everything as all or nothing... and that we have to be protected from ourselves (which is why we have a hundred new laws each year). But I believe this is an incredibly harmful position to take.<br /><br />If you believe you don&#039;t have the self-control to not abuse a drug, then use your better judgement and dont do it. But that doesn&#039;t apply to everyone and self-control can be learned.<br /><br />I&#039;m also much more of a psychedelics person (lsd/shrooms) and hate anything that makes me overly jittery/anxious (caffine). So I&#039;m not interested in high dosages.<br /><br />Finally, as other commenters have mentioned, doctors do indeed prescribe 10mg Methamphetamine dosages daily to treat ADD in pill form. But dextroamphetamine seems to be more popular since Meth is heavily controlled, so I&#039;ll try that out as well :)
