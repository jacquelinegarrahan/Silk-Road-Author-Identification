				To anyone who&#039;s used &quot;the machine&quot; to smoke DMT, last night I experimented with mine again and was nearly blown out of my seat by how hard it hit me.&nbsp; I had never felt so fucked up before, like my head felt numb and it looks like my room was coming apart.<br /><br />Is this how it feels to almost-breakthrough?&nbsp; My chest felt heavy too, I thought maybe I inhaled some kind of toxic fume from the plug at the neck of the bottle (it&#039;s a volcano oil pad, the steel mesh looking one).<br /><br />Does anyone know if the oil pads release toxic fumes when put over a lighter?&nbsp; I was under the impression they were made for vaping, so I didn&#039;t think much of it, I just never really felt that way on DMT before.&nbsp; It also was audibly sparking as I inhaled...<br /><br />Just making sure this isn&#039;t going to kill me by accident.

You don&#039;t know who you are, you don&#039;t have arms or legs etc. I usually don&#039;t even remember breathing out. DMT machine takes me there with one hit (70-90 mg of D loaded in that bitch).

				This was on just 20mg and barely much of a hit...I was just testing the potency of the machine and found myself zoning in and out of consciousness for a good 5 minutes.<br /><br />It&#039;s possible the pad had lots of soaked in DMT from sessions with my GVG though...I&#039;m not sure why but I can&#039;t get very far with the GVG no matter how I do it.
