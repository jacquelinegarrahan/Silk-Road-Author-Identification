				I am waiting on a package from SKYY and hoping it arrives to try some of his pink stars next weekend. I&#039;ve heard taking 5-HTP can enhance the experience as well as help preventing a hangover. So my questions are:&nbsp; &nbsp;1) How much to take, and how long before rolling should you stop taking it. 2) Do you take it immediately after rolling (before bed) or wait till you wake up the next morning. And once again how much to take.<br />Thanks for any advice!

				Don&#039;t take any 5htp before rolling.&nbsp; Take the 5htp as soon as you are done rolling / I keep it in my car to take once I get out of the venue.&nbsp; I&#039;d take 200mg if they are XR, or 100mg if they are IR.&nbsp; And take more once you wake up...

				I&#039;m glad you&#039;re interested in pre-loading and post-loading studies have shown that this can completely reverse neurtoxicity in mice and there is alot of reason to believe the same will happen with humans when you understand the mechanism of mdma.<br /><br />Not only will this reduce nuerotoxicity but it will also reduce you&#039;re tolerance which is something all mdma users should want to do. Take this shit pre roll (drop it close to when you drop mdma):<br /><br />1500 mg of Vitamin C<br />50 mg 5-htp (don&#039;t take too much pre roll but taking a little is a good thing in my opinion)<br />magnesium (this is for jaw clenching)<br />B6<br /><br />Post roll:<br />1000 mg Vitamin C (this is water soluble so taking too much is not really a bad thing and this will reduce neurtoxic affects)<br />100-200 5-htp<br />studies have also shown that smoking weed when you&#039;re coming down is actually good for you (I could link if you&#039;d like)<br />B6<br /><br />You may need to take more 5-htp if you are feeling that you are having post mdma depression or trouble sleeping the next few days but do not over do it. The most imporatnt supplements are 5-htp and Vitamin C so you don&#039;t have to take everything if you don&#039;t feel like it.<br /><br /><br />Happy rolling!

				I&#039;ve never experienced anything from 5-HTP, either. I always take it after a roll though (day after) because I know it probably helps rebuild some of that serotonin your brain is so lacking after a good night of rolling. I just take it for good measure, never felt anything notable. <br /><br />However, Vitamin C and Magnesium definately helps to put you back at baseline after a heavy night of rolling. I find that both of these, when taken together, can help you get out of that depression you sometimes get into after rolling.

				You need to preload with it for weeks in order for it to work well and never, NEVER, take it the same day/ same time you are rolling. Could cause severe seratonin syndrome. Be safe and PLURR :)<br /><br />Best Rergards,<br />Stormtrooper

				I feel the effects of 5-HTP more when I smoke Cannabis, maybe it&#039;s just a placebo effect, but I see colors brighter, and feel happier, other than just the stoned feeling of weed.

				5-HTP is a potentially harmful substance, the most toxic of the amino acids and potentially neurotoxic when converted to serotonin. However, since MDMA displaces serotonin by binding to the same sites on proteins (and the displaced serotonin is prone to degradation) taking a small amount (&lt;&lt;100mg) during the comedown may alleviate some of the residual adverse effects, although taking it beforehand may attenuate the desirable effects as well.

Those include proteins near the cell surface that facilitate the entry of serotonin and its analogues by adsorbing and then de-sorbing them, which you call &#039;reuptake proteins&#039;. The binding of MDMA displaces 5-HT (&#039;calcium independent&#039; release, as opposed to depolarization-induced release of synaptic vesicles) and prevents its uptake. The neurological changes are caused by the induction of feedback processes by the transiently altered serotonin metabolism, such as habituation of endocrine responses to serotonin. <br />Neurotoxicity results when a neuron is depolarized and cannot restore its resting state. MDMA (and serotonin) sensitize neurons to be depolarized, and if energy is insufficient to restore the resting state (repolarize) the neuron will die. There may be other factors involved, such as induction of oxidative stress by pro-oxidant metabolites of MDMA, but sensitization/lack of energy is the prerequisite for excitotoxicity. Your explanation of neurotoxicity seems untenable, or maybe I&#039;m not understanding what you were trying to say.<br /><br />That said, I don&#039;t believe that MDMA is necessarily acutely neurotoxic to humans in recreational doses. It depends on the person and the dose used, but ultimately it comes down to the brain&#039;s energy supply and resistance to oxidants (which is the premise of my MindFood capsules).

				You seem to have a better understanding of this than me, but every journal I have ever read cites oxidative stress as a result of neurotoxcity in regards to mdma. Mice have shown to have normal levels of serotonin the day after mdma use and decreased tolerance build up after taking antioxidants. I&#039;m hoping to learn more about this in the future though since this is my area of studies (I&#039;m a noob in it though).

Cell death by necrosis, in turn, results in the breakdown of subcellular structure and the release of oxidating factors, such as mitochondrial cytochrome C, which can then inappropriately oxidize other molecules. If sufficient antioxidants are present this can be avoided.<br />I never said oxidative stress does not contribute to neurotoxicity, but rather that the process can be understood in a more general sense.

				In my experience, taking 5-htp before rolling has a NEGATIVE effect on my roll. I&#039;m very experienced w/ MDMA and only ever take 5-htp AFTER rolling. When I took it for a few weeks before a Saturday night session in hopes that it would increase my serotonin levels and make for a wonderful roll, I hardly felt the MDMA at all (and I know it was good stuff because I got it from SR and my friends who did not pre-load w/ 5-htp rolled FACE). <br /><br />If you must take 5-htp, I recommend only doing immediately after your roll is COMPLETELY over and then for a few days after. <br /><br />However, mostly, I would recommend PIRACETAM for preloading and postloading w/ MDMA. Many people believe it increases the intensity of the drug and &quot;brings back the magic&quot; (some say it does nothing), but almost everyone agrees that Piracetam helps w/ neurotoxicity. <br /><br />

				As someone who takes 5-htp regularly, let me speak about preloading with 5-htp and the &quot;dulling&quot; effect...<br /><br />I have not found 5-htp to dull my rolls at all. However I find that taking 5-htp regularly not only puts me at risk for serotonin syndrome (which I manage really well), but it puts me at increased risk when taking MDMA. I only take low doses now, and with the great MDMA here I can&#039;t really complain...<br /><br />So I personally suggest not preloading with 5-htp, or if you must, preload with low amounts... 50mg or less. This is to avoid serotonin syndrome.<br /><br />But I think that the &quot;taking 5-htp beforehand dulls the roll&quot; myth is bunk. Increasing your natural supply of 5-htp doesn&#039;t dull anything about the roll at all. Taking 200mg+ of 5-htp might make your body a little tired from all the extra serotonin, though, so I think the confusion comes from taking too much 5-htp rather than the proper amount. There may be no benefit to it, but there is no inherent detriment if you take a REASONABLE amount of 5-htp.<br /><br />Although, do take what I say with a grain of salt, since I only speak from my experience and not from accredited expertise.

				All right, starting with 5-HTP and serotonin syndrome. I took 200mg a day for about 2 weeks and I began to develop the syndromes of mild serotonin syndrome: chronic sweating (and resulting dehydration), diarrhea, increased resting heart rate (from 65 to 85-90), vasoconstriction, higher body temperature, and hypomania. During that time I was only taking multivitamins and a Lamotrigine, 150mg. When I realized my symptoms, I tapered down to 100mg, then to 50mg, and my symptoms subsided within 2 days of the second tapering. I rose back to 100mg and was fine for several weeks, but when the symptoms recurred I dropped to 50mg again for several days. I&#039;m back to 100mg now but I&#039;m considering tapering back down to 50mg because of the downregulation you mention.<br /><br />If you think my brain chemistry is radically different, then it might explain why I don&#039;t experience a dulling effect. Downregulation would of course be a cause of dulling, so I understand why that seems to make sense... but you&#039;re going to have to explain to me how if your brain can only convert 5-htp into 5-ht so fast, how downregulation would occur when the body is capable of regulating this action. Or perhaps I misunderstand? I take 5-htp to increase my apparently naturally low serotonin supply and it works. It hasn&#039;t stopped working. If there was downregulation happening, wouldn&#039;t the 5-htp stop working as well?<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably chalk what I&#039;m saying up to placebo, though. I could assure you I&#039;m very in tune with my moods and my psychology as much as I want, but you&#039;d probably think I was a dolt.<br /><br />Anyway, although I&#039;m probably saying something you already know, the tolerance to MDMA isn&#039;t simply downregulation. There&#039;s also the neurotoxicity of oxidized dopamine hurting serotonin receptors, correct?<br /><br />Again, although I think preloading with large amounts of 5-htp will lead you into serotonin syndrome, my experience shows that low amounts of 5-htp don&#039;t dull rolls... so maybe I&#039;ve something terribly wrong with me, but from what I can tell the claim that it dulls rolls is a myth. Well, at least I&#039;ve the right mind to say this is coming from my own understanding of the chemistry and from my own experience, and not from a professional degree or whatever.

				MDMA displaces 5-HT (and DA, and NE, and others) by adsorbing to the same site on some proteins, causing 5-HT (et al) to desorb and possibly leave the cell or be catabolized. When MDMA binds, it exerts a different inductive (electronic) effect on the protein than the 5-HT did, which is propagated through the protein, altering its binding affinities for other substances and other proteins, and which accounts for part of its effects (in addition to the effects of 5-HT being displaced). I believe that this is how substances as closely related as 2C-B and 2C-I (or MDMA and MDA, etc.) can have distinctly different physiological effects.

				I used to buy 5-htp for the day after rolling in case I felt the post-mdma depression that most people experience.

I have never taken it before rolling because I heard that it wasn&#039;t a good idea.<br /><br />I also tried taking it on a daily basis to see if it would act as a sort of anti-depressant but after a month or so I didn&#039;t notice any effects so I stopped buying it.

However I was always morose until taking 5-htp, despite a diet that should have increased my serotonin levels. Depression and mental disease run in my family and those in my family who take 5-htp experience a similar benefit from it as well. I believe we are unfortunately unable to create serotonin as well as other people are. I personally believe that this is the cause of some forms of clinical depression and that in some cases a little extra serotonin would completely cure all symptoms... this is the case for me at least, because between a mood stabilizer and 5-htp I am finally HAPPY.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to make of all of that, though. If anything it makes me think that perhaps general advice about supplements as psychoactive as 5-htp should be taken with a grain of salt and that each person should be considered on their own before someone recommends 5-htp or another supplement.
