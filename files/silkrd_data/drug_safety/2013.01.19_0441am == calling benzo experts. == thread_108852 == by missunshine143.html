				I&#039;m asking for help from anyone with benzo experience. other than anonymousaddict, dude you can&#039;t write plain english. <br /><br />I got a sample from a new vendor on the road. I&#039;m on the fence of how legit it is. It&#039;s supposed to be 2mg xanax. it&#039;s a yellow bar with R039 on it. I&#039;ve looked it up on the pill identifier thing on drugs.com. so far, I think that it&#039;s legit but I have no way to be sure other than eating it. I do not want to kill myself. <br /><br />http://www.drugs.com/imprints/r-0-3-9-12075.html *clearnet warning*. the second image is exactly what I have. <br /><br />thank you my fellow roaders.&nbsp;

				keep one pill under tongue and tell how it tastes , how it feels, and your benzo tolerance. if you want to find out if it&#039;s alprazolam without eating it you will probably need chemist&#039;s help.

				Blatant forgeries aside, it looks like a perfectly good 2 mg generic alprazolam bar to me. <br /><br />If you wish to take it in a way you get to taste it you&#039;ll notice a distinct bitter taste associated with alpralzolam. Most people find this tatste to be pretty unpleasant though and prefer to swallow the tablets (or pieces broken off of then) in one go.<br /><br />In case you have no benzo experience you should be a bit careful though, Taking 2 mg of alprazolam will&nbsp; not do you any permanent harm, but it could knock you out fir quite some time. Also, do not combine it with alcool unless you are up for some serious memory loss, and in some cases respiratory depression. If you are an experience user 2 mgs of xanax wil not do all that much to you, but for a first time user these bars can knock you down like a hammer to the head.

				To me, benzos have a saccharine-like taste - bitter-sweet, some people don&#039;t like it, but I have never found it to be that bad - valium, Xanax and Rohypnol all had that saccharine-like taste.<br /><br />Yep, that&#039;s a generic Xanax - I&#039;ve had that same type before. Don&#039;t drink with it (never drink with any benzo&#039;s - you WILL be royally fucked up &amp; won&#039;t remember anything of it - been there, done that, please, please don&#039;t drink with those!

				What exactly is your question you seem to already possess the evidence that it&#039;s what the vendor says it is and 2mg isnt gonna kill you.<br />So when you to decide to post what kinda information you want from a benzo expert also think about what kinda brain chemistry you have as the effect can vary widely from one type of chemistry balance to another.<br />My point is Introverts become Extroverts and vice versa from the effects of xanax.<br /><br /><br />Also be aware that benzos are highly addictive and tend to bring out drug seeking behavior in addiction prone individuals.

				A commonly prescribed dose for mild to moderate anxiety is 0.5 mg two or three times a day, or as a single dose before engaging in some activity that triggers anxiety that is not continuously present. <br /><br />The 2 mg bars are not to be taken whole and/or multiple times a day unless there is a very good reason to do so. <br /><br />

				Thank you all for your responses. I only use benzos for my L/Shrooms trips in case of emergencies. I don&#039;t really like the effects itself for recreational purposes. <br /><br />I have tested this for two days and have concluded that it is bunk. Sunday night, I took one bar (2mg), attempted to sleep to no avail. (I should note that I have zero tolerance for benzos right now so 2mg should theoretically knock me the fuck out for 8-10 hours). Finally went to sleep around 2 30-245am, woke up wide eyed at 7am (which is normal without medication). Last night, I took two bars (4mg now), thinking okay, fine, maybe this time this will work. nope. I had a night of horrible sleep, kept waking up all night. <br /><br />NyQuil is stronger than this shit. I will be throwing it out. There is no point of continuing taking something that&#039;s bunk. and I cannot proceed with my planned trips without having backup plans. sigh, I&#039;ll wait for my preferred vendor to re-up his stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I will also be posting this in the vendor&#039;s review thread and changing my feedback to 1/5.

				Yea, buying outside of Sr isn&#039;t a good idea. Might as well roll the dice on one of the scam sites or FE. You would have no protection.<br /><br />You felt nothing after taking 4 mg? I take it occasionally for insomnia. I have had Xanax do nothing to help me sleep but sometimes nothing helps. Still you would feel something after 4 mg ( with no tolerance ).&nbsp; <br /><br />Did you communicate with the seller? If everything else was ok than he/she might not have known it was fake. Is it something they normally sell? It does the seller no good to give out a fake free gift.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				4 mg is quite a bit. If you have no tolerance that should knock you out within the hour for most people. Bit even with a pretty large tolerance, you&#039;d definitely be able to tell if you took 4 mg alprazolam or not. <br /><br />As for the taste of it: xanax is definitely bitter, very noticable if you chew down a tablet. Inert compounds may give a chalky/dry feeling even with legitimate tablets, but the bitter flavor is hard to miss. If a tablet is supposed to be 1 mg xanax and its not bitter when you chew it down, there is something going on there. Perhaps it contains some substance to mask the bitter flavor, but unless that was stated explicitly (comparable to &#039;banana clonopin&#039;) i&#039;d assume there is something wrong.
