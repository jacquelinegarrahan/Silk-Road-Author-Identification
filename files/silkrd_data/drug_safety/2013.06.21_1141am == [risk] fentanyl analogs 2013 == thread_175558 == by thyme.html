				Hi.<br /><br />Just a quick heads up. This is not a drugsrbadmkay warning. [Y&#039;all are grownups or had better be, you know your risks, you decide to bike/drive to work, take substances, etc. But since you can&#039;t buy any kind of easily inspected/verified product, you have to risk poison, substitutions, and sometimes toxicity, in the name of public... safety. It makes sense to some legislator, I guess.]<br /><br />So, this is your public health FYI moment. <br /><br />Test shots are great, but fentanyl and analogues can blow right through a test shot/dose, potentially. I&#039;ll let you do your own research on dosing, but I think most of you are aware. <br />The outstanding folk on bluelight and opiophile have no doubt written more&nbsp; (eloquently, at length) about this situation and past ones. <br />This just hadn&#039;t been brought up here yet, and... it needed to be. <br />If people -want- to knowingly take fentanyl/analogues, great, more power to them, no problem with that. Sneaky hidden fentanyl is a different story.<br /><br />I&#039;d follow this in the MMWR.<br /><br />Consider having someone around you get familiar with a naloxone kit. Kits are inexpensive to free.<br />Naloxone rescue kits (injected or nasal) may or may not be available in your area. Try<br />http://www.overdosepreventionalliance.org/p/od-prevention-program-locator.html<br />If that doesn&#039;t work, ask your local needle exchange.<br />If you can&#039;t find your local needle exchange in the US, try http://www.nasen.org/programs/<br />or, if there is nothing in your area, locate your local HIV/HCV support network, and they will likely know; if you can&#039;t do that, try the social worker for the emergency department.<br /><br />with respect, and a strong desire for everyone&#039;s continued respiration,<br />thyme<br /><br />And now, the inevitable *Wall*Of*Text*!!!!<br /><br />Links break - these can all be looked up by title.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Recommendations for Laboratory Testing for Acetyl Fentanyl and Patient Evaluation and Treatment for Overdose with Synthetic Opioids Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network<br /> June 20, 2013, 15:15 ET 3:15 PM ET CDCHAN-00350<br /> Summary: Recently, a number of intravenous drug users have overdosed on a new, non-prescription injected synthetic opioid, acetyl fentanyl. Acetyl fentanyl is a fentanyl analog previously undocumented in illicit drug use that is up to five times more potent than heroin. CDC recommends increased vigilance by public health agencies, emergency departments, state laboratories, medical examiners, and coroners for patients with symptoms consistent with opioid overdose and laboratory results showing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) positive for fentanyl.<br />CDC also recommends that public health officials work with laboratories to carry out ELISA screens for fentanyl, and if the results of these screens are positive for fentanyl, conduct gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) confirmatory testing on specimens to confirm or rule out fentanyl and its analogs, including acetyl fentanyl.<br />Background  Since March 6, 2013, 14 overdose deaths related to a novel, injected non-prescription synthetic opioid have occurred among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island.&nbsp; Ten of those deaths occurred in March.&nbsp; On May 30, 2013, Rhode Island Department of Health confirmed that the implicated synthetic opioid is acetyl fentanyl, a fentanyl analog previously undocumented in illicit drug use.&nbsp; Acetyl fentanyl is not available as a prescription drug in the U.S.<br />The age of the persons who died from an acetyl fentanyl overdose ranged from 19 – 57 years, and 10 of the decedents were male.&nbsp; The toxicology testing results for most of the decedents showed, in addition to acetyl fentanyl, varying mixtures of drugs, including cocaine, heroin (morphine), ethanol, and benzodiazepines.&nbsp; However, none of these additional substances were present in all decedents and none of these persons tested positive for fentanyl by GC/MS after testing positive for fentanyl by ELISA. Toxicology results for one decedent showed only acetyl fentanyl (by GC/MS) and no other substances.&nbsp; These deaths represent a significant increase in the number of illicit drug overdose deaths compared with the number of cases typically reported in one month in Rhode Island.<br />There have been unconfirmed reports from other states of increases in illicit opioid-related overdose events seen in emergency departments.&nbsp; Media stories have associated these events with “fentanyl-contaminated heroin” or, in some cases, to fentanyl alone.&nbsp; It is possible that these events are related to acetyl fentanyl, but confirmatory testing is needed.&nbsp; States other than Rhode Island have not informed CDC that they are testing for acetyl fentanyl.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) has confirmed two additional deaths linked to Acetanilide, n-1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidyl — also known as acetyl fentanyl —an illegal synthetic opiate with properties similar to morphine.<br />These most recent deaths, which bring the total number of deaths linked to this drug in Rhode Island to 14, occurred on May 26, 2013 in two individuals who were transported from the same residence in southern Rhode Island.<br />“While final cause of death is still pending further toxicology testing, it is anticipated that acetyl fentanyl will be a significant factor in these deaths,” said Michael Fine, M.D., director of HEALTH.<br />The Rhode Island State Health Laboratories identified this drug as Acetanilide, n-1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidyl — or, acetyl fentanyl — on May 30, 2013. This drug is not FDA approved, is not commercially available, and is not prescribed by physicians.<br />The Office of the Medical Examiner initially noted 10 deaths of patients who appear to have died with this substance in their bodies during a time period spanning early March to mid-April, and later confirmed an eleventh death during the same time period, as well as a twelfth related death that occurred on May 16. Most of these patients were from the northern Rhode Island area, and appear to have been intravenous drug users.<br />Dr. Fine said it is important that Rhode Islanders understand that drug addiction is a very serious chronic disease for which help and treatment resources are available.<br />He added that those who are addicted to drugs or who know someone who is addicted should educate themselves about the use of Narcan (Naloxone), an emergency antidote to opioid overdose. Narcan, which can be used in an emergency situation to potentially reverse the effects of drug overdose, is available at four Walgreens Pharmacies in Warwick as part of a pilot project for the dispensing of Naloxone to patients by pharmacists who have a collaborative agreement with practitioners at the Miriam Hospital.<br />A list of resources that can assist with drug dependence and addiction can be found at http://www.bhddh.ri.gov/SA/application.php</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />edited by thyme: There are now more cases than I care to update or count. Use startpage, or search using other anonymized/insulated methods, re: fentanyl overdoses.<br /><br />In other news, US drug policy continues to be a Fail.<br />Read The Poisoner&#039;s Handbook, by Blum; it&#039;s a history of forensic science that discusses Prohibition and the intentional and unintentional poisonings that resulted. A bit heavyhanded, maybe, but the similarities will be obvious.

				+1 to you for this info and a bump for this thread. I&#039;m not an opiate user but I&#039;ve heard some disturbing claims about some of these fentanyl analogues being passed off on SR as fentanyl and also being mixed with some of the heroin.

				I guess we could call that fauxycodone.&nbsp; Seriously though, fake oxys with fentanyl and other things have been around for many years.&nbsp; They even make some that look 100% legit.&nbsp; Then they have some that look legit until you break them.&nbsp; Then others look fake.&nbsp; Yeah sucks with the newer fenanyl analogues.&nbsp; One lab in particular is selling a 100:1 mix of lactose and fent analogue which I&#039;ve seen being sold as fentanyl or something else here.

(Sorry, I only can keep up with 75% of the board.)&nbsp; If there&#039;s a heroin/opioid test results thread, could someone link it here? Thanks.<br />Online markets are of interest to public health in part because of the power to self-correct and to disseminate information very rapidly and more accurately than street markets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Presumptive/reagent testing for fentanyl/analogs that&#039;s been added to heroin is of limited utility, will not catch all the analogs, and there are other novel opioids of concern that aren&#039;t going to be found if someone isn&#039;t looking for them. I don&#039;t have a link to a fast-track for testing for fent and its analogs, etc., for the online market. Because this is enough of a public health concern (hint: CDC advisories don&#039;t come out too often about these things), there might be some incentive for one of the EU labs and/or someone who wants a very nice project?<br />[looks hopeful]<br /><br />@Jack - fauxycodone, thank you, word of the day. :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Lots of fauxycontin (FC?) out there.&nbsp; Definitely not new, but there does seem to be a big swell of it all at once.&nbsp; Oops, just noticed the first post doesn&#039;t include this, but the other news stories did: the Montreal &quot;pills&quot; seized were faux oxycodone. Also that I need to edit first post for sucking in the format. [done, and added the Montreal/North Bay PD press release.]<br /><br />Not any information on the compounding quality and variability between tablets that I&#039;ve read in the news.<br />Fentanyl is not forgiving to the amateur compounder.

				A non-story? Edited&nbsp; much later: maybe, compared to the 05 episode - but the deaths are still remarkable.&nbsp; Big ups to CDC for taking this seriously and responding.<br />But the timeline of &#039;months&#039; to respond, and the general &#039;meh&#039; response of many labs... right. Drugs aren&#039;t popular. We knew that.<br />See the MMWR of 10/2013. <br />(edited 10/2013 as forums will be withering off and I won&#039;t be around to reply.)<br /><br /><br />I have little respect for the local law enforcement in this. &quot;Just don&#039;t use it.&quot; Wow. Effective. Right up there with &quot;we don&#039;t give out naloxone kits because then people will just use drugs.&quot; <br /><br />Sorry to keep hammering away at this, but this is real, and it&#039;s here as well. We just don&#039;t have (and won&#039;t have) good data for this community&#039;s outcomes.<br /><br />I have no objection to individuals choosing to ingest per their own decisions; I do object to bogus drugs being passed off with a high risk of poisoning people.<br /><br /><br />====<br /><br />hxxp://www.ydr.com/crime/ci_23579203/overdose-cases-linked-powerful-fentanyl-laced-heroin-raises<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Overdose cases linked to powerful fentanyl-laced heroin raises alarm bells statewide<br /><br />A York City Police detective said at this time, there has been no spike in overdose deaths in York County.<br />By HANNAH SAWYER <br />Daily Record/Sunday News<br />Updated:&nbsp; &nbsp;07/02/2013 12:37:34 AM EDT<br /><br />York, PA -<br />Addicts read a cluster of deaths like a calling card, Ken Dickinson said. Word of a dangerous high, like the one produced by the fentanyl-laced heroin now being blamed in six overdose cases in Lebanon County, pulls them into communities. What was meant to be a warning, becomes an invitation.<br />Dickinson is director of marketing at Gaudenzia, a residential and outpatient drug and alcohol treatment center with 130 programs in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. He said he first heard of the fentanyl-heroin drug cocktail in 2005, when it appeared on the streets.<br />Fentanyl is a prescription opiate that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine -- the standard by which opiates are measured. It doesn&#039;t take much to kill someone, he said.<br />&quot;There&#039;s such a small amount that&#039;s needed that there can be mistakes in measuring it out and selling it,&quot; he said.<br />The heroin circulating in Pennsylvania is already some of the &quot;highest potency heroin around,&quot; he said, &quot;and now they&#039;re adding something to it.&quot; <br />Police monitoring reports<br />A couple of grains of fentanyl in a bag of heroin -- grains the size of salt -- can cause an overdose, York City Police Detective First Class Andrew Shaffer said.<br />&quot;With heroin, you have more overdoses than any other illegal narcotic that&#039;s out there,&quot; Shaffer said. &quot;You just run that risk every time of dying.&quot;<br />Shaffer said his department was aware of the overdoses, including one death, in Lebanon County and an additional two cases in Dauphin County investigators believe are tied to fentanyl use, and they are continuing to monitor reports.<br />On Thursday, the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs issued a statewide warning about fentanyl. According to the news release, the drug has been linked to 50 fatalities in Pennsylvania this year.<br />The news release called for coroners and medical examiners to screen for the drug in all heroin overdose cases.<br />At this time, Shaffer said there has been no spike in overdoses in York County. York County Coroner Barry Bloss, who did not have official records available at the time, said he was not aware of any overdose deaths caused by fentanyl.<br />Memorial Hospital also reported no cases of overdose from fentanyl-laced heroin, and a spokesman for York Hospital said that while there have been recent overdose cases at the hospital, there is no way to determine in the emergency room if the heroin used contained fentanyl.<br />The Lebanon Daily News reported earlier this month that officials in Lebanon County had taken the unusual step of issuing an official warning to users about the high potency and dangers associated with the drug.<br />Advising drug users about laced-heroin is part of what is called a &quot;harm reduction program,&quot; Dickinson said.<br />&quot;You pretty much acknowledge the fact that there&#039;s going to be people that are going to use these drugs no matter what we tell them. The harm reduction says that I need to educate and inform them,&quot; he said.<br />In some communities, these programs will go so far as to distribute clean needles and syringes to people, he said. Methadone clinics, which keep people from using street drugs, are another example of the harm reduction model.<br />Shaffer said currently city police have no plans to issue a similar warning about the fentanyl-laced heroin in York.<br />&quot;It goes without saying: Don&#039;t use it,&quot; he said. &quot;Our message is and continues to be don&#039;t use heroin.&quot; <br />A growing market<br />Heroin users walk a tightrope between getting the best high possible and dying, Shaffer said.<br />&quot;They (addicts) push it right up to that limit,&quot; he said. Part of fentanyl&#039;s appeal is it&#039;s ability to help them test those limits, and its potency also contributes to its staying power. Fentanyl appears cyclically, he said. A period of dormancy will be followed by a jump in deaths.<br />But the addict population is growing, according to Dickinson. It is much larger, and younger, than when the drug first appeared in 2005. The changing demographic could be problematic, increasing the &quot;potential&quot; for more deaths and the introduction of a new generation to fentanyl, he said.<br />A bloom of young people who were prescribed opiates is to blame, he said. Then regulations changed and doctors became more educated about the drug&#039;s effects. Opiates became more expensive, too.<br />So, they turned to heroin, he said. &quot;The heroin is so plentiful and so cheap that they end up using.&quot;<br />And suppliers seem ready to feed into the burgeoning appetite for strong highs, Shaffer said.<br />&quot;We&#039;ve seized more heroin this year ... than I&#039;ve seen in 18 years,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#039;re seizing thousands of bags of heroin at a time.&quot;<br />What is fentanyl? <br />Fentanyl is a prescription narcotic used to relieve severe or chronic pain, commonly used for cancer patients or as a last-resort pain medication. It&#039;s available as a skin patch, lozenge, pill, shot, a film that dissolves in the mouth, or intravenously.<br />As a recreational drug, acetyl fentanyl can often resemble heroin, as it has the same consistency, color and packaging. If a heroin user unknowingly mistakes fentanyl for heroin and takes too much of the drug, the user is at high risk of a fatal overdose.<br />During the last major fentanyl overdose outbreak in 2006, there were 269 deaths in Philadelphia alone. <br />Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs<br />About Gaudenzia<br />Gaudenzia is a residential and outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program operating in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware.<br />Treatment is based on a therapeutic community model, which places emphasis on personal and social responsibility, Ken Dickinson, director of marketing, said. Clients are expected to adhere to certain rules and the &quot;whole milieu of the community becomes the treatment.&quot;<br />Gaudenzia serves more than 17,000 patients annually, including adolescents, mothers and patients with mental illness, according to its website.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
