				Is it normal for someone that has had very little opiate experience couple times i ground up some hydrocodone pills and swallowed em just to see what an opiate high was like... well i tried a stamp of heroin just a tiny bit... well it was pretty much a hydro high little bit weaker... anyways its 2 weeks since i used it and ive had extreme loss of appetite. Is this normal after over 2 whole weeks????! I don&#039;t use opiates regularly and do not plan to use them again... im just wondering if this is normal or possibly another health issue, id rather not discuss this with my dr. Ive already lost roughly 20lbs body weight.

				In short, no, that is not normal and likely has nothing to do with your little opiate experiment.

				meh idk the weight it was NYC stamp. Playboy bunny one. Very small line of powder. I just snorted half in one nostril waited 5-10 min did the rest in the other.... when i did hydros it was 5mg ones i think i did like 6 pills crushed orally and on an empty stomach. It was the usual head dizzy /w a mild constant dopamine buzz.... i sweat a lot, got itchy and eventually took a nap. Honestly nothing worth getting addicted to LOL<br /><br /><br />But seriously could it just be my stomach shrunk some from not eating much for 5+ days... right now my hunger is slowly coming back but I&#039;m not able to eat much and some foods/smells make me feel a little sick to my stomach.
