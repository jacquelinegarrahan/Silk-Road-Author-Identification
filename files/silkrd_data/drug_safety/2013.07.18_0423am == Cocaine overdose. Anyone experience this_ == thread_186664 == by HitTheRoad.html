				On a bit of a binge tonight and wondering if anyone has experienced or seen this happen? If so, was it due to too much taken on the night or from long term abuse and if so what exactly happened?

				You can OD with cocaine quite easily, in fact, if you inject.<br /><br />It never happened to me personally but I had a friend who had a cocaine OD by IV.&nbsp; Luckily he was not alone and the ambulance came very quickly or he would have had much probably a stroke or heart-failure. The idiot wanted to do the hero dosage to pass as the great guy in front of some girls and he injected almost 1 gram of quite pure cocaine in the veins (while he was used to pretty shit street cocaine and not either 1/2 of that dose).<br /><br />You can die from respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or heart-failure.<br /><br />With snorting is much more difficult but it can happen also in that case; but usually all OD deaths by cocaine are mostly accidental than not pure &quot;too much use at a time&quot; kinds.

				That person is quite lucky to be alive as that dosage could certainly kill someone.

				When I tried coke for the first time I slightly overdosed. I did the first line, waited and felt nothing but a slight euphoria. So I took a second line and it got a little better. Through media bullshit I thought it was supposed to make you freak out, like MDMA, which I tried later, so I ended up taking 4 lines and then it really kicked in. It was an heavy rush with heavy sweating and tunnel vision. Not very pleasant. I would like to know how close I was to a heart attack o_O<br /><br />Now 1 line is enough. I think you have to do coke a few times until you notice the effects well.

				Think in my case I freak myself out when fiending on it but I usually just cam myself down and relax about it again followed by racking up another line!!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />That guy injecting a gram, fookin hell!!! Frightening&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Saw a friend snort a gram in two lines before but I&#039;d say it was a very low percentage of coke being local crap.

				^ I know what you mean. I&#039;d be stting around doing coke and might dash upstairs for something and come back downstairs to sit back down and all of a sudden the heart is pounding from running upstairs!<br /><br />A lot of the time I have to keep putting my t-shirt back on and off because I feel like I&#039;m sweating on and off.<br /><br />Only started using xanax recently recently which take s the edge and negative thoughts away!<br /><br />A lot of it is unnecessary paranoia too I&#039;d say&nbsp;
