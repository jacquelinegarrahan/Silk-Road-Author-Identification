				Been IVing heroin for just over a month 4 times per day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Got tired of the vomiting, the fear of overdose, the fear of accidently injecting into an artery, being dopesick, etc.&nbsp; Was a fun trip for sure, but glad I quit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The withdrawals were terrible after only a month of consistent use I tell you.&nbsp; Spent 3 days in the fetal position shivering.&nbsp; &nbsp;On day 7 and feeling better though. <br /><br />From my experience I would say that unless you have nothing to live for, this is a drug that is best left alone.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Congratulations, I have never been addicted to heroin but I know that it&#039;s one of the hardest things to possibly go through. You&#039;re very very brave and strong to have conquered it on your own, I hope things continue to improve for you and you can be happy.

				Props. I only ever made it up to smoking, and that was relatively difficult to quit, even though I only did it for like a week straight. I can&#039;t imagine how difficult it was to quit after a whole month.<br /><br />Can you elaborate on what was the impetus for quitting?

				I have no doubt that it was difficult to do as I&#039;ve been there done that, but you should also know that next time (if there a next time) likely won&#039;t be as easy.&nbsp; A week-long recovery is best case scenario, honestly.&nbsp; A month with only a few minutes sleep each day/night is something I&#039;ve seen with my own little eyes.&nbsp; It can take almost a year to feel &#039;normal&#039; in some cases.&nbsp; For reals.&nbsp; Most of the public thinks it&#039;s a &quot;week of flu like symptoms&quot; and addiction is over.&nbsp; And then there&#039;s the whole &quot;cigarettes are harder to kick than heroin&quot; bs.&nbsp; The public really have no idea.<br /><br />Still, that shit can be SOOOOoooo&nbsp; good.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Does suboxone help H withdrawls?<br /><br />Props by the way man.&nbsp; Its so hard to quite the little stuff, let alone that monster.<br /><br />The reason why I ask about Sub and H, is because I have a line on Sub and I would be more than happy to help if it would make you feel better.

Always with a solid pct and always have goods on hand while using in case my estrogen spikes.&nbsp; They make me feel euphoric and confident as hell!!&nbsp; My fave is Test + tren + dbol.&nbsp; God, gonna order a cycle soon:-) can&#039;t wait.&nbsp; In the meantime it is so much easier for me to do H.&nbsp; <br /><br />So when I wanna kick H for a while I always use roids.&nbsp; They give me a natural high(kinda) which keeps my spirits and energy levels up.&nbsp; When I go off cycle it seems I revert back to H to make me happier.&nbsp; I have even tried anti-depressants, they don&#039;t work the same.&nbsp; I have been diagnosed with chronic depression.&nbsp; Haha, maybe I have just had low Test my whole life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, steroids compared to heroin are much safer as long as you do some research and know proper dosing, injecting, pct and how all the drugs may interact with each other.&nbsp; Steroids is #146 on the list of reasons people are admitted into the emergency room for ingestion.&nbsp; Haha, Vitamin C and taking daily vitamins have more people taken to the ER!!!&nbsp; But as GunsoftheNavarone86 said they can be dangerous with oral use and ignorance.<br /><br />Glad you kicked it bro!!!&nbsp; I stopped two weeks ago after a 4 month binge on H.&nbsp; God damn that sucked.&nbsp; Lots of hot showers and long walks helped.&nbsp; Walking helps with the muscle cramps/aches and overallbody pain.&nbsp; That is if you can walk!!&nbsp; I missed a whole week of work.&nbsp; Shitting myself, puking headaches, muscle cramps, super intense chills, muscle weakness, and then insomnia and depression.&nbsp; Today is day 13 for me.&nbsp; Each day I see an improvement. Slept like 4 hours straight last night!!&nbsp; I know that doesnt seem like much to some people, but after going whole days and nights without a wink of sleep it feels great!!!&nbsp; My social life is coming back around too.&nbsp; Still a little low on energy.&nbsp; Tried exercising a few times and get winded real easy.&nbsp; Going for short hikes to build up the cardio slowly.&nbsp; I am guessing it will take me another two weeks to feel &quot;normal&quot; again.<br /><br />Even after going through all this, I am pretty sure I will use H again.&nbsp; I know, fucked up.&nbsp; Gonna try and go the whole summer without touching it.&nbsp; Planning a good summer roid cycle:-)&nbsp; Just have to get back in shape before I start up again!<br /><br />Congrats Isop!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Thats awesome Isop. I&#039;ve got a close friend whose been clean for about a year <br />He used to IV a lot, he said he would get to the point where he just would fuck over anyone to be able to get some. He told me the friends he hung out with weren&#039;t true friends, they would just go score together and use together. If anything he said they really got on each others nerves a lot.<br /><br />That&#039;d b really cool for vendors to put me on a &quot;do not sell H list&quot; I&#039;ve been thinking about trying it.....But I&#039;m almost certain i would fall in love and go from there...<br /><br />My buddy said the worst part about quitting was never wanting to move, never wanting to do anything, just thinking about heroin, and then your super depressed because you know thats all you think about and you feel like shit because of it. <br />He&#039;s a really awesome guy though, like I assume you are Isop, its always good to know people are taking positive control of their lives and making things better. <br /><br /><br />Keep on keepin&#039; on brothers. &#039;SLAYER&#039; all around, as they say.

				Congrats on kicking your habit. One question though. Are you going to kick drugs all together or continue using others besides heroin? I&#039;ve never faced an addiction to any opiates or drugs in general, but I&#039;ve heard about how people kick one drug by doing another drug. Like the person before stated, he does steroids instead of heroin sometimes. (Excuse me if I&#039;m stating this wrong, I only went through the post quickly) So do you plan on taking another drug to help avoid using heroin? If so I&#039;d suggest looking into LSD. I&#039;ve heard heroin can give a blissful feeling from friends, and that LSD gives feelings of peace and euphoria. LSD isn&#039;t addictive at all, unless you&#039;re weak minded, but based on the fact you kicked heroin I think you&#039;ll be okay. <br />Congrats on kicking heroin, and good luck in the future. Just curious, how much did you spend on your habit weekly?

Since I have some free time, I&#039;m going to type out kind of a lengthy response to your post, so if you are busy skip over my reply for now&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People tend to thing Heroin is like the most damaging thing you can do to your body, but truthfully the most dangerous aspects of H in terms of long-term damage are caused by: 1: The cuts found in street level heroin, which can be anything from sleepinol to shoe polish, and 2: the consequences of years of injecting drugs (i.e. collapsed veins, endocarditis, poor circulation). There is also the concern of contracting diseases like HIV/AIDS and Hep. C, but these can be avoided by simply never sharing needles and other equipment. Plus, they are spread by injecting anything, not just heroin. The most immediate danger to one&#039;s health is definitely overdose, so dosage is crucial. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously, like any street drug, one has no idea what purity they are getting. This is why to be safe you should always do a teeny tiny shot with any new batch, then work your way up to a good dosage. Problem is you have to do this every time you score; I have had junk that I bought back to back which looked and smelled exactly the same but was way different in terms of strength. That being said if one has access to relatively pure H, and they practice safe injection techniques (rotating injection sites, new needle every shot, sterile environment, proper filtration, etc.), they can spend pretty much their entire lives on heroin and face no major life-threatening health consequences (as long as they don&#039;t over do it on the dosage!!). In contrast Meth is WAAAAY more damaging to your body than heroin is, just look at what it does to your teeth, and it makes the user a fucking maniac over years of abuse.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as you&#039;re statement about a dull period in your life, and going back to using: this is the real battle with quitting heroin. IMO, there are several important things which will help you to stay clean for good: First, get a good support group of clean people, well at least people who don&#039;t use heroin. These people will hopefully help you to see the joys of life outside of using, and they can help you through any rough patches when you might want to use. Also, exercise is extremely important (obviously you are already doing this with the roids and all). Part of feeling normal after heroin abuse comes from getting your body to start producing its own endorphins again, one of the ways you get this jump started is through a good work-out regimen. Nutrition is also really important. You may also really consider seeing a professional therapist if need be. Struggling with addiction (ESPECIALLY TO OPIATES!) will be the single hardest struggle of your life, and if you find yourself depressed and wanting to use again, a psychiatrist may be able to provide ways to help (including medication if need be).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You asked me why I ended up going back to the drug, the reasons are many. I tried all the things I just told you to do in the paragraph above, and honestly they did help -- they&#039;re a good part of how I ended up getting any good clean time at all. For me though, I eventually relapsed different ways each time. Once it had to do with a girl whom I thought I was in love with, and I thought she was the only one who truly understood me. She is a heroin addict also, and she got clean the same time as me. We attended AA meetings together (BTW AA is a whole different subject I could go off on but won&#039;t, if it helps you great, but I personally think it does jack shit), we swore we would never use again and all that but eventually she ended up relapsing first. I couldn&#039;t bring myself to leave her. It wasn&#039;t long before I was using too and back to being a full-blown junkie once again. After a while, she left me for my friend (another junkie). Funny how life works out huh?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other reasons I have relapsed: when I lost a job I had for years when the economy tanked in &#039;08, depression caused by long term addiction, withdrawal from suboxone, and on and on. Basically, I am a junkie for life dude -- even if I quit for good I am always going to be a junkie. There is a little voice in the back of my mind telling me to use 24/7 and sometimes I can ignore it for a while (even years like I said), but eventually it just takes that one slip up and I am back into the cycle of addiction. This is what I meant by, &quot;pray you avoid it.&quot; It causes nothing but pain and misery in the long run, and a sincere junk habit is for life. If you have been using for months, even a year, its not too late! It is once you have eclipsed the 2 year mark IMO that basically there is no turning back, your habit has continued too long and your brain has been permanently altered to crave heroin (or opiates in general). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t ever stop, but most people aren&#039;t able to. Fuck check this one out -- the last time I was in rehab the guy who was the #2 administrator of the whole place was an old-school junkie. He had been clean something like 30 years and the last month I was there he fucking relapsed and got fired! I saw him a year or so later and asked him why it happened and he told me his wife left him and shit but also that, like I said, that god damned voice in your head never goes away, and he just wanted to use one more time, AFTER 30 YEARS!! Ok, nuff said for now, I don&#039;t want to write a novel on here, but I just wanted to share&nbsp; ;D Oh BTW, with your puking thing -- some people just puke when they use but I would say it could have also been the cut in whatever junk you were getting, and you may have used too much. Hard to say, but I will only puke if I have been clean a while and I over do it on the dosage. Hopefully you&#039;ll never find out what caused the puking since you are never going to use again, right?&nbsp; ;D Best of luck bro, and if you or anybody need to to talk please don&#039;t hesitate to message me, I&#039;m usually on here at least once a day.

				Congratulations, Isop, and anyone else who&#039;s ever kicked a habit.<br /><br />I kicked H by going to a clinic, stabilizing on 40mgs of &#039;done, and tapering off over a period of about six months.&nbsp; Even that wasn&#039;t painless, and the worst part was that it seemed to take FOREVER.<br /><br />Another reason I love SR...&nbsp; I can chip without having an immediate hookup to jump start another habit! :)&nbsp;

(I do know someone who cant stand them) I don&#039;t want to sound like your parent or guidance councilor but that shit is super addictive and usually fairly easy to get, mostly in pill form.&nbsp; I started with Lortabs, had a friend that got a script for 120 7.5&#039;s each month.&nbsp; I bought every single one off him.&nbsp; Next came oxy, then finally H.&nbsp; I had a &quot;grip&quot; on things till I tried H.&nbsp; Now I live paycheck to paycheck, sometimes using payday loans and it&#039;s a close call paying rent each month because I cut it so close.<br /><br />There probably isn&#039;t an hour each day that goes by without me thinking about shooting up.&nbsp; The mental addiction is 10 times worse than the physical, IMO.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t ruined my life per se, but has made it infinitely harder.&nbsp; Hard to hold a good girlfriend while using too.<br /><br />Stick with weed or something relatively safe if you feel you must do something, just stay away from H.&nbsp; <br /><br />Off my soapbox now :)
