				I know, I know, music + LSD =&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; But I&#039;m a HUGE movie fan and I love watching movies tripping.<br />I&#039;ve found a couple movies to be particularly awesome: <br /><br />2001 A space odyssey - obvious pick; anything Kubrick is my fav<br /><br />Fantasia - also an obvious pick<br /><br />The Shining - my absoultue favorite while tripping, the depth of field and parallel lines provide wicked visuals&nbsp; <br /><br />Apocalypse now - so surreal it makes it total sense<br /><br />Blade Runner - trippy lighting provides good vis<br /><br />Wall-e - no dialouge, beautiful images and light-hearted fare...love it<br /><br /><br />Any others?<br />&nbsp;

				I watched The Day The Earth Stood Still on a somewhat high dose of MXE. I think that movie would be perfect for acid. Just be sure to get the original, not the recently remade version.

				I should also add that this past weekend I dropped a tab of Gammagoblin&#039;s L. and watched Back to the Future 1&amp;2. The first one was excellent! It had me feeling all nostalgic. The second one was shit. Biff&#039;s overacting ruined it for me. B2TF 2 would have been way better on cocaine.<br /><br />@lvl&nbsp; they made a movie out of naked lunch! was it good? That book was totally fucked!! Burroughs is a nut! lol&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D

				The City of Lost Children. Watched this w/ only subtitles and playing Shpongle as the soundtrack throughout the movie. By far my best acid &amp; movie experience. Lots of great suggestions in here though, I&#039;ll be checking out Waking Life on my next trip.

				This may be very subjective, but Across the Universe was the first movie I watched and it was the first time I tripped on acid.&nbsp; It was completely beautiful.&nbsp; The movie is a musical, and I hate musicals.&nbsp; I detest musicals, but this movie spoke to me while tripping &amp; touched me in a profound way.

				Yellow Submarine&#039;s an obvious choice but still worth looking into. However there&#039;s a 1976 French children&#039;s film I&#039;m sure a few of you are familiar with called &#039;The Twelve Tasks of Asterix&#039; which is definitely a little psychedelic at some parts and well worth a watch while high or tripping.

				I&#039;ve been waiting for somebody to ask this!<br /><br />My experiences with a few movies:<br /><br />Fantasia, it was the older one - It was pleasant and the animation was nice to watch. I didn&#039;t like certain parts of it, but it didn&#039;t ruin my trip.<br /><br />Microcosmos - This was amazing. It&#039;s all close ups of bugs wandering around in a meadow.<br /><br />Baraka - Watch this if you&#039;re into watching heavy stuff while on acid. I felt like a terrible human being by the end of it, but at least I was aware of it.<br /><br />Cat Soup - The animation was fun to watch, but the overall tone of the movie is very dark. It has a message about humanity at the end of it that is depressing. It&#039;s like Baraka in that way.<br /><br />Xavier: Renegade Angel - It was weird. I don&#039;t recommend this because it makes you feel crazy, especially when characters break the fourth wall. I also can&#039;t unsee how distorted the Adult Swim logo looked at the end of it.<br /><br />The Animation Show - Some of the sad sketches were painful to watch. The rest were enjoyable.<br /><br />Here is a list of movies/ shows that I think may be good on acid, but who knows:<br /><br />Retro Game Master<br />Spirited Away <br />The Cat Returns<br />Akira Kurosawa&#039;s Dreams (Iffy, for some scenes are sad.)<br />The Complete Monterery Pop Festival<br />The Problem Solverz<br />True Stories<br />Super Babies: Baby Geniuses 2<br />The Iron Giant<br />Batman: The Movie<br />Most Pixar movies<br />The Super Mario Brothers Movie<br />Old cartoons that are corny like Bill and Ted&#039;s Excellent Adventure or The Super Mario Brothers Super Show.<br /><br />Nightmare mode: (It&#039;s a joke, please proceed with caution when taking lsd.)<br />Brazil<br />Grave Of The Fireflies<br />Twin Peaks<br />Bronson<br />Naked Lunch<br />The Plague Dogs<br />Pan&#039;s Labyrinth<br />Twilight Of The Cockroaches<br />Fantastic Planet

				gg, nice list !!! I want to see a lot of those now that you menetion it... Brazil, Batman, and I keep hearing about microcosoms and baraka too. But let me ask you gg, have you seen The Shining on LSD yet?? I thoght it was the best. Also have you tried Fantasia 2000, I thought it was a lot more &#039;fun&#039; in disney sense of the word. plus i heard the first one is for mescaline not LSD, so says an old old school head<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about into the void, but honestly The Wall sends me into a bad trip. Anytime I so much as think about Syd Barrett when I&#039;m tripping out I suddenly become really freaked out and think that I&#039;m frying my brain or I&#039;m giong to end up stuck in a perma-trip for the rest of my life or something dumb like that. Also that scene where he breaks the razor-blade in half with his bare fingers makes me sick&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; but the wall at the end is sooooooo tight!!!!!!!!!

It is not nearly as scary as you&#039;d think...actually not scary at all, nobody dies and the only &quot;scary&quot; thing about the movie is that jack goes crazy, but on LSD he&#039;s just funny. Also, long held shots + parrallel lines = visual delight I consider it the ultimate LSD movie and I need someone to back me up on it. WATCH IT!!<br /><br />When you do watch it, pay close attention - watch for all the native american themes like the fact that the hotel was built on an &quot;indian burial ground&quot;; notice the color of everyone&#039;s wardrobe before they get to the hotel and watch how they change (red/white/blue vs earth tones); listen for indian chanting noises at key moments; also Jack meets the devil at 66 mins 6 secs; and what about when jack talks to ghosts?? - is he really talking to ghosts or is he talking to a mirror? idk!!&nbsp; I could go on and on...Kubrick was a genius and the evidence is in the shining!

				Be careful with watching movies while come up too if you&#039;re seeking for great insights from tripping. But yeah, it&#039;s not the rule as sometimes coincidences and signs on acid are kind enough.

				Requiem is one of my favorite movies and I have actually watched it while tripping. Pretty intense but I have seen it so many times, kinda used to by now. <br /><br />One of the best ever was a live Pink floyd laser light show dvd, dont know which one though. Always enjoy watching kind of the hill while first coming up and it never fails to be incredibly hilarious. I would second fantasia, big lebowski, and baraka or planet earth all of which I really enjoyed while tripping. Anything that boggles your mind like the universe series or journey to the edge of the universe by nat geo is pretty entertaining for winding down, especially if indoors on mescaline.

I have watched all his films innumerable times (except the less kubrickian ones: the killing, killer&#039;s kiss, and path&#039;s of glory) and I&#039;ve have made a &#039;spiritual connection&#039; with pretty much all of them. IMHO Kubrick&#039;s films are &quot;high art&quot; and they can reveal a lot of subjective truth to viewer/audience and make very real connections in the same fashion that high art does (with or w/o drugs, the drugs are just a short-cut to make the &#039;truth&#039; reveal itself faster&nbsp; haha). <br /><br />Old boy was a damn good movie but I dont about watching that tripping. the plot was twisted, especially the climax, abd the foreign language/subtitles would be too much for me. when I&#039;m tripping I can&#039;t even handle brit films like anything guy ritchie, trainspotting, BRONSOn, not even Clockwork ornge. But assuming your fondness for terry Gilliam, I&#039;m guessing your not American...just a guess<br /><br />Blade runner wass also sick tripping (even sober). I don&#039;t know if you saw the workprint version (with the voice-over) but I actually thought it was better than original tripping. <br /><br />I can also vouch for Tree of Life, the first 30mins were fucking mind blowing!! [I think] T.O.L. was supposed be told from the perspective of god, so the camera angles were out-of-this-world (literally) and there were all these crazy&nbsp; jump cuts from all these beautiful landscapes here on earth to these massive cosimc collisions somewhere in the vastness of our universe! It was crazy - good for believers and non-believers alike&nbsp; ;)

I felt the same about Alince in wonderland too. The characters were so bizarre they gave me bad vibes.

It is just fucking fantastic.<br /><br />Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is great tripping, although I think Time Bandits is my favorite Gilliam work.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend The Fountain and Enter the Void, but only if you are prepared for that type of experience. Definitely wiki em&#039; first. Oh, and Bronson is pretty crazy, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anything Kubrick is great for an acid trip, really. This has been mentioned before, for sure<br /><br />Anything Nolan will induce a mind-fuck, but sometimes it&#039;s hard to follow all the dialogue on a really intense trip. I really liked Inception tripping, though.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few more I cannot recommend more highly:<br />-Oldboy <br />-Animatrix<br />-Ghost in the Shell<br />-Paprika <br />-The Tree of Life<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yesss kubrick is god! I have watched all his films innumerable times (except the less kubrickian ones: the killing, killer&#039;s kiss, and path&#039;s of glory) and I&#039;ve have made a &#039;spiritual connection&#039; with pretty much all of them. IMHO Kubrick&#039;s films are &quot;high art&quot; and they can reveal a lot of subjective truth to viewer/audience and make very real connections in the same fashion that high art does (with or w/o drugs, the drugs are just a short-cut to make the &#039;truth&#039; reveal itself faster&nbsp; haha). <br /><br />Old boy was a damn good movie but I dont about watching that tripping. the plot was twisted, especially the climax, abd the foreign language/subtitles would be too much for me. when I&#039;m tripping I can&#039;t even handle brit films like anything guy ritchie, trainspotting, BRONSOn, not even Clockwork ornge. But assuming your fondness for terry Gilliam, I&#039;m guessing your not American...just a guess<br /><br />Blade runner wass also sick tripping (even sober). I don&#039;t know if you saw the workprint version (with the voice-over) but I actually thought it was better than original tripping. <br /><br />I can also vouch for Tree of Life, the first 30mins were fucking mind blowing!! [I think] T.O.L. was supposed be told from the perspective of god, so the camera angles were out-of-this-world (literally) and there were all these crazy&nbsp; jump cuts from all these beautiful landscapes here on earth to these massive cosimc collisions somewhere in the vastness of our universe! It was crazy - good for believers and non-believers alike&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am actually American :) Mom is a french teacher, though, so was introduced to a lot of Euro &#039;ish many Americans may or may not have been privy to. <br /><br />I mentioned Oldboy and I realize now I should mention one need watch it sober first, then tripping, due to not being able to read subtitles while tripping. If you know what&#039;s going on already, it&#039;s really cool tripping, I think.<br /><br />It is so crazy that you are mentioning Blade Runner, as I just finished it an hour ago during a pretty intense MXE + weed combo, and I totally agree with you on the workprint version, too! It is so annoying when Deckard is narrating in the other vrsions. And the happy ending and unicorn shit is dumb, too. It makes it way less subjective, making it not good for tripping. Seriously, I cannot agree with you more on the workprint version being best. I got the 5 disc bluray for a reason :D<br /><br />EDIT: lol, i got confused about the versions you were talking about and derided the version you like, sorry! i havent actually watched the version with dialogue tripping, only sober, and i didnt like it. i will take your recommendation and try watching it with dialogue. I feel like such an idiot, haha. Coming down from the hole and my short term is fucked lol. also, carl sagain is indeed the shit. i was the only one in my bio class that liked the universe lol

				I really enjoy a good episode of planet earth or blue planet while tripping. Always can get down with cartoons especially earlier seasons of south park. Fear and loathing is pretty cool tripping but sometimes its a little too much, gotta be in the right mood. Apocalypse now is great tripping too. Sometimes I&#039;ll pop a LOTR in, but I never watch the whole thing. Old goofy 80s movies are always funny too.

				This isn&#039;t really a movie to watch, but I have three Youtube videos that are amazing while tripping. I&#039;ll link you to them here.<br /><br />1) Science Saved My Soul: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6w2M50_Xdk<br />I don&#039;t know why this video works so well while tripping, but it just does. It really makes you understand the universe and the world, and everything seems so clear when that guy talks. Then at the end when the music kicks in you just feel like a rockstar. Everyone&#039;s mind will be blown.<br /><br />2) Storm by Tim Minchin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U<br />Tim Minchin is awesome. His rhyme scheme&#039;s and brilliant language will also blow your mind, not to mention the cool animation. There&#039;s one point where the camera scales back to reveal the earth and some brilliant silence, and this girl I was watching it with while tripping literally just said, &quot;Oh my fucking God.&quot; Also mind blowing.<br /><br />3) The Music Scene by Blockhead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhheiPTdZCw<br />NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. That&#039;s kind of an exaggeration haha, but seriously, this is what you want to watch if you feel like letting your trip take you over. Seriously, go watch it right now sober and you&#039;ll begin to understand what that shit will do to you while you&#039;re tripping. It&#039;s an amazing experience.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not much of a fan of the yellow submarine movie or things like that on cid.&nbsp; I recommend a comedy movie, even if you have seen it before, it will be great.

I think I&#039;m more curious about some of his other movies like Eyes Wide Shut and 2001 while tripping, those might be more fun.

				I recommend Twin Town, a dark British comedy. It&#039;s intense in places but can also leave you rolling around in stitches.

And yes, K + 25i with the &#039;jump shots&#039; was glorious and quite daunting, indeed! Right on, man!

				I watched Garden State on acid once. Loved it. I&#039;m a big admirer of Natalie Portman and it felt like I was hanging out with her and getting to know her.

				Anything by Tim Burton is just wicked! I highly recommend any Studio Ghibli films as well. ;)
