				I hate to admit it, especially since I haven&#039;t seen anyone else post anything like this, but...<br /><br />I ordered various smaller amounts of some very similar looking chemicals.&nbsp; Most of them white powders, some of them RC&#039;s.<br /><br />The sellers, all being very responsible and professional, shipped them well packaged and unmarked as expected.&nbsp; Unfortunately this leaves me with several small bags of...of...Something.<br /><br />I know as a go forward, the best plan is to differentiate the orders somehow, either in weight, or shipping address, etc, but what do I do with what I have now?&nbsp; Short of running them through a mass spectrometer, is there any way to go about identifying them?<br /><br />Thanks

				This seems to be a somewhat common problem, actually, so don&#039;t feel too dumb.&nbsp; Assuming all of the products look alike and weigh the same, you could try contacting the vendors privately and asking them to confirm something about their packaging (the way it&#039;s packed, the type of stamps, something like that).&nbsp; If they weigh differently, you should be able to figure it out once they all come in the mail.&nbsp; If you&#039;re still unsure, proceed with caution and try a small amount of whatever to gauge its effects.&nbsp; Good luck!

				In the future, as someone else has suggested, use a different middle initial in your name for each order.<br /><br />As for your current items, I would contact the sellers you bought them from. Maybe they can help.

				Method #1 (the &quot;fun&quot; method): SAMPLE THE GOODS!<br />- &quot;fun&quot;, in this instance, is synonymous with &quot;potentially deadly&quot;.<br />Method #2 (the &quot;safe&quot; method): Ask vendors about small details on their packaging<br />- Careful how much you have the vendors reveal, of course.

I&#039;ve asked vendors to write numbers inside the packaging on many occasions now, and I think this makes things much easier on their end.
