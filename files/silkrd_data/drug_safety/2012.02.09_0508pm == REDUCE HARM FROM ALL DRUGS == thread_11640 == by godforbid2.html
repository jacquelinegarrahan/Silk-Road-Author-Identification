				Simple really. Buy your drugs from Silk Road. None of them will be real or what the say they are. Bingo, you&#039;ve reduced harm straight away.

				Sorry you had a bed time on the SR, Ive had nothing but good things to report. Use the forums to find good vendors... dont buy alot at first either. Get a smaller size so you can check that packages arrive and for quality

				I just read your other posts. Sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Did you try to get a refund or partial refund or even get in touch with B19Meech? Valium are notorious for being counterfeit, at least you only bought 20. Try clearnet pharmacies in future- much cheaper and there are plenty who do the real deal. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be too put off, I&#039;ve bought shitloads of different drugs on Silk Road- every time they&#039;ve been pure, high quality and from trustworthy and friendly vendors.

				Me, my kitties, and most of the people I&#039;ve had the pleasure of meeting and dealing with through the Road/forums are all peace-loving, fair, honest, and decent. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let one bad experience ruin your opinion of a whole group of people - that sort of thinking is what drove this underground in the first place. <br /><br />Free hugs from your Local Friendly Neighborhood Shredmod.
