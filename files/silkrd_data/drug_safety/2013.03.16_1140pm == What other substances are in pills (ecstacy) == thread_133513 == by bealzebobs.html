				Most pill vendors describe their product as for example &#039;200mg MDMA and nothing else - lab verified&#039; Has anyone here actually conducted an analysis of their own? I&#039;m interested to know what substances are used for binders etc. Specifically im interested in whats in the &#039;premium pills&#039; such as partyflocks and nintendos. I&#039;d like to think that it is just mdma, but I find different pills containing supposedly the same amount of mdma seem to have varying effects. People describe some as &#039;mongy&#039; and others as better for dancing.

				Whilst pills sold as &quot;ecstacy&quot; have been known to contain anything and everything; the Dutch pills you refer to, if genuine, only contain MDMA and inactive binder/filler. <br />MDMA is a psychoactive drug with subjective effects. The exact same pills can give even the same person very different experiences.

				There have been multiple reports of pills sold as MDMA containing amphetamines, caffeine, melatonin, cocaine and others, in some cases having absolutely zero actual MDMA content. One of the suppliers in my area, when I asked him about the content and dosage, told me he did not give a shit as long as people bought it. Which is sad, as that just gives the anti drug people more ammunition.

				Not sure it it helps but I normally check * clearnet warning: http://www.ecstasydata.org * to see if the pill is listed. I like the Nintendo&#039;s for instance and they got a nice report as being just MDMA. If there were other active substances in there the reports would list it, otherwise it&#039;s just inactive binders. I&#039;m sort of an Ecstasy snob and can safely say that a single Nintendo hits me about the same as 200mg of good clean Molly. I think a huge factor is the reported differences in known good pills has more to do with the setting and expectations of the user than anything else. The high I get off MDMA at a party with friends vs strangers or at home alone or with my girl are all going to be different even off the same pill.<br /><br />Testing is always a good idea and normally when I find a batch I like I buy a bunch of it so I am working with a known variable. Between batches some can contain more MDA or MDPBP depending on how clean the syth process went leading to more visually trippy or speedier rolls without adding anything to the pill.<br /><br />With all that said, most everything sold at raves and on the street should likely be considered cut or replaced with something else until tested. There are lots of things that are like MDMA that are much cheaper and easier to get a hold of. SR is nice because you can get lots of feedback pretty quickly on different suppliers and their gear.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Just one further thing to add. Pills will break down slower than crystal/powder, so on top of varying absorption rates depending on the person and their stomach contents there&#039;s that factor too.

				There are usually binders and fillers in tablets. If not, a 200 mg MDMA tablet should weigh no more than 200 mg - it may be possible to press mdma into tablets without any additives, though such pills would probably end up being hard, brittle and off-white.<br /><br />Common additives in pill pressing are inactive substances like lactose and cellulose. There are used in real, big phamra produced, medications on a very wide scale as well. If the pills have any color then a colorant is used as well, obviously.<br /><br />Obviously there are blatant fakes on the market as well, containing no ore little mdma, but other psychoactive subsances instead. Often these are substances that mimick the effects of mdma, but in some rare cases you can be in for an unpleasant surprise. I know of one case where 50 mg oxazepam tablets were coloured and then sold as xtc tablets on a festival. Tbe dealer in that case figured he could get away with that scam, since all hit victims would be sedated long enough for him to escape. This tactic worked, albeit only once.<br /><br />

				An ecstasy pill, along with the active ingredient, generally contains a few of the following:<br /><br />Binder:<br />Microcrystalline Cellulose, Xantham Gum, Hydro Ethyl Cellulose and Lactose are the most common.<br /><br />Lubricating agent:<br />Generally Magnesium Stearate is used to improve the flow of the mixture through the machine, although other lubricants are occasionally used instead<br /><br />Coloring agent:<br />Generally Iron Oxide, Natrasole or a food-grade pigment.<br /><br />Hardening agent:<br />Not generally needed but Copovidone is sometimes used to strengthen the tablets if the active ingredient is very crumbly.<br /><br />Of course all these are what an experienced presser would use, the majority of pills around Australia are pressed by idiots who have no idea what they are doing and use shit like chalk in their pills. I can jump on a TDP-0 hand operated press with Xantham Gum, Stearate, Iron Oxide and an active ingredient and churn out better looking tablets than 90% of what&#039;s on the market at the moment.

				You can find out a lot at pillreport.com<br /><br />A lot of ecstasy pills have amphetamine in them which tends to make the mdma inside them more intense. I kind of like those pills they are strong. The Ferrari pills i got from one vendor felt just as good as taking 200 mg of mdma crystals but at that pillreport.com some are said to have some amphetamine in them.<br /><br />When you get the mdma crystals from someone and it has a lot of powder then it could be cut with a lot of deiiferent chems that have similar effects as mdma.&nbsp; I ate 250 mg of 4-fma and it felt a lot like mdma but not as strong as 250 mg and it did&#039;nt last as long as 250 mg would.<br /><br />I got a capsule once with 50 mg mda and 100 mg mdma and it felt stronger then 200 mg of pure mdma. You can really stretch your mdma crystals if you buy some mda to go with it and take smaller doses. There is no cross tolerance with mda and mdma as far as I know. MDA is dam good by itself. Pills are rumored to be cut with coke, research chems like mephedrone, pentedrone and others, meth is added to x pills some times. It&#039;s really up in the air but Hiezenburg has the purest mdma I ever had.
