				As someone else posted, the IRL market for marijuana is extremely flooded right now, even more so on college campuses. You&#039;re going to have to offer superior product at a lower price to break into the game. You&#039;re going to need people to buy from you, and you&#039;re going to want those people to tell all their friends how bomb and cheap your weed is. Weigh everything out in front of your customers and give extra on every sale. People remember stuff like this and if your product is good they will come back to you.<br /><br />Don&#039;t deal on campus. I&#039;m not familiar with college life, but I assume that there are dorms on campus, and that someone may ask you to deal weed to them in the dorms. Do not do it. Always meet somewhere safe, like a house.<br /><br />Don&#039;t smoke all your &#039;sale&#039; weed. Do the math for how much profit you want to make, and weigh your stash out separately from the main stash. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve seen weed dealers smoke themselves into debt.

I AM familiar with college life, i have been in and out of there properly and have seen soooooo many people go down because of stupid shit. Honestly the best advice i could ever give you is to not become a dumb ass dealer slanging bud on campus. You will build a reputation super fast and you will absolutely get rolled. The benefit is sooo small, what are you gonna do, pick up a qp every week for 1,000 bucks and slang 8ths at 45? fuuuuck that bs, that is the small time crap that gets you embarrased because you have to stand in front of the school board or somethign and whine about why you deserve to come back to campus and will never have an oz. of weed again. let the pawns be the middle men, there are too many hands to be shaken and that is more risk to you.<br />If you want to make money with the least amount of risk and are serious about it, take an actual CLASS in botony and green house growing and grow some indoor weed, in soil or hydro, but soil is easiest. this way, no one but you knows whats going on, and you are producing huge amounts of cash. you sell to a single individual locally and on SR, and youll be able to make hash and edibles with the trimmings. the key here is to learn and go on a forum, get your own place and do not live in the dorms (it is possible to move out of the dorms and get an apartment, i had friends who did).<br /><br />dealing just gets you a reputation that does not un-stick. producing your own and having the least amount of contact as possible is the key. good luck.

				I think I can give some advice, from personal experience. I&#039;ve already graduated college, but only recently started slangin herb. I don&#039;t like the term dealer or slangin though, so I tell people I&#039;m in Cannabis Supply Chain Management. (I run things with class.)<br /><br />1) Please God don&#039;t sell your product in sandwich bags. Not Ziplocs, but rather the shit a step below with no closing seal. Don&#039;t be ghetto, plus that shit makes you and your vicinity skunky. Small dub-type bags are better, but I don&#039;t like them cuz they compress the nug, and it&#039;s a pain to open/close all the time. <br /><br />2) Be proud/knowledgeable about your product. You have to give a story with it, make them believe their buying a scenery or lifestyle if they buy this strain. And always smile, be courteous. The whole point of SR is to rid this business once and for all of the louses, paranoids, skeezos, and sketchy douchebags that ruin this for the rest of us.<br /><br />3) Always give a bit over, so you seem generous. An eighth should be 3.6-3.7, etc. -- people love that.<br /><br />4) After you&#039;ve established some trust with your clientele, a good thing I do to raise capital to buy a new ounce or w/e is to hype up this new stuff you&#039;re gonna get from CA or CO or w/e and tell your clients that for a $10-15 down payment now, they get $5 or so off their eighth, etc. when it arrives. This gives you easy fundraising, plus locks these people into actually buying the stuff period. And hey, they renege, you keep their down payment. ;) (You actually have to procure the good stuff you&#039;re hyping; don&#039;t be lame and give them schwag after all your promises.)<br /><br />5) By God if you ever sell greens with sticks and/or seeds, may you be cursed with cellulite and vagina crabs forever. You&#039;ve been warned ;)<br /><br /><br />Good luck,<br />-Horse<br /><br />P.S. All that talk above about not smokin all your own stuff is so true. Try and pinch a tiny bit from every eighth you sell so to build your stash. Selling 420 without cannibalizing = very good $$. 420 w/ cannibalizing = no money.

Stay sober while selling - paranoia&#039;s a bitch that can crop up from seeing a flashy blue half a mile down the street. especially if you&#039;re carrying. BTW - after about 6 months to a year of selling it&#039;s normal to shit yourself every time you see the old bill!<br /><br />5. don&#039;t be late - if you are send the customer a message as soon as you know you ain&#039;t gonna make the meet until x time<br /><br />6. don&#039;t sell short deals.<br /><br />7. don&#039;t set up meets with more than 1 customer in one place at the same time. (2 birds with one stone kind of thing - not worth it)<br /><br />8. get a 2nd pay as you go mobile phone - theres nothing worse than someone ringin you up at 2am clucking even though they know they&#039;ve got no chance of being served. must admit this was more a problem with selling coke than pot. turn your phone off when finished for the day. only ever take ONE phone out with you - you get caught with any kind of narc and 2 phones you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />9. if you MUST meet in a location unknown to you turn up 10-15 minutes early to check the place out - keep an eye out for CCTV and drive round the block to see if anything looks out of place. stay out of site until your meet turns up, just in case they bring a few dudes to do you over.<br /><br />10. if you are lumbered with crap gear take it back to where you got it - some customers won&#039;t give you a 2nd chance. if possible try before you buy.<br /><br />11. don&#039;t keep your sales stash, scales OR bags where you live. i used to have a friend that would look after mine for about £50-£100 per week, depending what he was looking after. another dealer friend of mine still has his buried at the back of a field somewhere and takes the dog for a walk when he needs to pick up. a friend of mine who got pinched (nobhead sold from his flat) had his shrink wrap confiscated to link it to bags he&#039;d already sold<br /><br />12. don&#039;t deal with dickheads. any loud mouth fucker who doesn&#039;t know the meaning of subtle will end up getting you pinched. <br /><br />13. once you got a customer base you are happy with don&#039;t take any more customers on, unless at least 2 of your current customers or mates know them and can vouch for them.<br /><br />not really a rule, but a helpful tip: <br />14. i used to set up runs, so i get a few calls and try to organise it so i can do 5 or 6 drops in a row.<br /><br />TBH unless you&#039;re shifting at least a coupla bars a week, or growing your own, i don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it - it&#039;s a lot of hassle to keep safe and make money. but of course it&#039;s your call!<br /><br />right, lecture over...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, this is really helpful.

				A few rules my friend lives by, most of which have been mentioned though...<br /><br />1) Never ever let them know where you live. Eventually you WILL get robbed if you do. Or worse. Ideally you need a place that&#039;s public enough to not get robbed in broad daylight, but private enough for the exchange.<br /><br />2) Get a nickname. If you tell them your real name, and then they tell you their name is &quot;Big Smoke&quot;, then they&#039;re one up on you. <br /><br />3) Don&#039;t deal with people that are extremely paranoid. They&#039;re more likely to get caught than anybody.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t get high off your own supply. Every dealer I know basically smokes for free but makes very little. Ask yourself whether you&#039;re in it for free smoke or the MONEY. Plan accordingly.<br /><br />5) Don&#039;t deal in amounts so small that it&#039;s not worth the risk. It&#039;s far better to sell halves and make 40 each deal than to sell 4 eighths and make 10 each deal, because its only one transaction. If you slang grams for 5 bucks profit each, your risk/reward ratio is way off.<br /><br />6) Trust your instinct. If you&#039;re feeling weird about someone, don&#039;t sell to them. If you&#039;re feeling weird about a certain deal, don&#039;t do it. Ever wonder why when people get caught&nbsp; they always say &quot;I knew this was a setup.&quot;? Because they DID.<br /><br />7) Know your local laws. If your local laws say 8oz and under is a misdemeanor and over 8 is a felony, try not to buy more than 8 at a time. Try not to keep more than 8 at any one location at a time. See if dealing within so many feet of a school is a felony - if so, don&#039;t do it. And if you needed a reason not to, dealing to minors is nearly always a felony.<br /><br />8) Give extra when you weigh it out. My only reasoning for that one is because they always weigh less when you weigh them later. That&#039;s been my friend&#039;s experience. I assume its from further drying but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />9) Build an inventory of both product and cash. Running out of product is bad for business. And cash because you&#039;ll never know when your dealer has something special or on sale you need to get ahold of.<br /><br />10) Believe in karma. Do it with morals, etiquette, and professionalism and you&#039;ll be rewarded. Rip people off and it will come back to bite you.<br /><br />11) Prepare for success at the start, and for failure when you get rolling. Know your rights if worse comes to worse. Know the best local drug attorney (if cash really gets rolling, think about a retainer - its a investment into your business).<br /><br />12) People don&#039;t sell drugs. Drugs sell themselves. So make sure its the best price/quality ratio you can get.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Everyone had some real good pointers here, there are definitely some decently intelligent individuals here<br /><br />Id recommend that everyone watch the Never get busted and Never get raided DVDs I thought it was a joke in the beginning but after watching them a couple times its really great insight from the inside, the guy explaining everything was the Top narcotics officer in texas and he gives you alot of tips picked up from years of experience<br /><br />He even goes to teach you how to sell weed but i doubt that it is for small time, if you watch the movie youll know what I mean, hes explaining how to deal extreme amounts of pounds or at least thats the vibe i get off of it<br /><br />Also, Shit happens, I honestly dont know of many people who havent at least been arrested once from full time selling just make sure to always plan ahead and never let anything get the best of you, Nothing is wrong until the police have drugs in their hands and confronting you with it and even then its best to to remain silent, Know your rights, Dont ever let the police intimidate you or manipulate you to for that matter<br /><br />Best of luck, If you are a girl i think you should be more worried about the cuttys you deal with rather than police, officers are extremely light on females!!! <br />

				Also, Anything you are thinking of throwing away in your home that might come and bite you later, Dont throw it away. Burn it. or if you live in a city make sure to ditch that in a trashcan far away from you and wipe it clean of finger prints<br /><br />dont deal with anyone you dont trust or think that will rat on you, that is seriously the biggest piece of advice anyone could give, No randys Never even if the money is good never sell to anyone you dont trust a little bit or have gotten to know over time

				First and foremost you have to decide what you are in it for, money or just free weed?<br /><br />I have little experience in actively trying to make money dealing, but here were some of the things I did and some avenues I wish I would have explored<br /><br />1. Since you are in college I am going to go against common knowledge and tell you that if you live off-campus, sell from your apartment. These are places that experience high traffic, infrequent traffic, disturbances throughout the night, and rarely do neighbors have decent relationships with one another. Driving around will just make you lose money in gas, which would be an acceptable cost of doing business if money were the object - but if you just want cheap / cheap weed its a killer.<br /><br />2. The above, however, relies on one key point - you can only sell smaller amounts and you can only sell to close friends - with money (mostly) out of the picture what you have established is essentially a group-buy where you take quarter of the inventory as a &#039;fee&#039;.&nbsp; If they have a friend who just wants to come pickup, awesome - your friend can come over and pick it up and then give it to their friend - never deal with the &#039;friend of a friend&#039; types.<br /><br />3. As everyone else has said, get a second phone - hell setup a google voice account that then goes to this phone, now they have to subpoena Google for the records, then the mobile carrier.... that is expensive as fuck just to take down some small-time kid who sells to his friends<br /><br />4. Go read Dorm Room Dealers, you can get it from Amazon - it essentially goes in to WHY the cops don&#039;t give a shit about rich upper-class college-attending kids dealing small amounts<br /><br />5. Something I wish I had done - if your friends are as nerdy as I assume you are get them to use TorPM, TorChat, etc... to get in contact with you or encrypt all your correspondence with gpg.... with Tor available on mobile phones there is no reason not to explore this possibility<br /><br />Though if you want to sell larger amounts or harder drugs follow what everyone before me has said - always be cautious

				It is best to deal weed, or any other illegal substance for that matter, anonymously. You don&#039;t want to get busted in your neighborhood.<br /><br />My experience is: if you have direct contact with supplier, people would prefer cheaper, but quality stuff. That is, over SR.

				I used to &#039;slang MDMA and I can attest to everything that is said here, I would buy by the oz and I&#039;d be dry in three days, Drugs sell themselves. I never cut, I was prompt all the time&nbsp; with my stuff, always on point or a little over with amount, my problem was mdma was my DOC (drug of choice, and it still is) but I got out of the game, and I still get calls on my old pay as you go phone asking for some shit. Basically treat your customers as normal fuckin&#039; people <br /><br />EVERYONE HATES DDT (Drug Dealer Time aka I&#039;ll be there in 45 min and you show up 4 hours later)<br />When I sold I always would do so in public at warehouse parties and other raves and shit and I had a bandanna covering my face at all times and a hat on, Its an extra layer of &quot;security&quot; I guess, it made me feel safer. I would wear a black bandanna when I was holding and selling, and Red when I wasn&#039;t selling or was out of shit. People would wear Green bandannas if they were buying etc. <br /><br />

				my main advice that has only been touched on in this thread is dont brag, it just spreads jealousy, its abit hard to do at first because your making good cash and your proud of yourself. also dont let your clientele know how much you pay for the product <br />get a second cell, turn it off when you have nothing<br /><br />also, listen to biggies 10 crack commandments :D

				SR weed is a 100% rip off. The quality is good at times but the price is bad on every single bit of weed being sold. If you got good shit for normal prices people would buy the fuck outta your weed but weed is the most likely thing to get seized.&nbsp; Dont listen to the idiot who says the market is saturated. The market is saturated with over priced weed.........if your shit is priced normal go for it. If your shit is priced like every1 elses than there needs to be something special about your shit or else it will be slow.

				right well racked my brains a bit and here&#039;s what I came up with... been selling weed for about 9 years...never got caught...have worked with friends/girlfriends/partners/gangs/businessmen...been stopped and search once [not holding] but that&#039;s it.<br /><br />r.e having business partners i generally DONT RECCOMEND it, HOWEVER if you trust each other 100% (not 99 but 100!) then it will make your life A LOT easier...<br /><br />1) Don&#039;t keep your stash where you crash, don&#039;t even sell out of a car...the reg. plate is just a big sign with your name and address on it.<br /><br />2) Always give a fake name or alias, when people ask where your from or where you live always give them a place that&#039;s at least a hour away from where you are.<br /><br />3) NEVER BE STONED WHILST DEALING. Self-explanatory.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t give under bags.<br /><br />5) never bait up one place, keep it MOVING different places for different customers, always make sure you have a &quot;escape route&quot; in each of your dealing spots so when things turn sour you got a way out.<br /><br />6) always see cash before handing bud over, the opposite way round when dealing with a new supplier always see the bud before handing money over (none of this &quot;give me the money and i&#039;ll go get it&quot; crap)<br /><br />7) never mix family and business. EVER.<br /><br />8) never let people know how much money you make, never give people info. on your supplier, never give ANYONE information on your punters.<br /><br />9) don&#039;t tell people &quot;your schedule&quot; anything beyond &quot;gotta see next customer, laters&quot; is bad.<br /><br />10) get 3 phones, one for personal/regular life. one for buying. one for selling. make sure it&#039;s a CHEAP phone something you can easily throw away if you wanted too.<br /><br />11) make a backup list of all your suppliers and customers and hide it somewhere. really good.<br /><br />12) never get high off your own supply, separate your percy from your shots when you pickup your big bit.<br /><br />13) never tick/give credit to customers, it&#039;s a pain in the ass collecting money and when that person will never buy another bag from you again or in a long time as they know they&#039;ll have to pay what they owe before they can get another bag.<br /><br />14) don&#039;t snitch<br /><br />15) ALWAYS ALWAYS PACK if your holding...my reccomendation is a stanley knife keep it real sharp and you can legally carry it cos the blade isn&#039;t that long.<br />

				the less rules you obey the more chance you have getting :<br /><br />1)caught<br />2)debt<br />3)dead<br /><br />my personal advice or gut feeling is to tell you to not get into it in the first place, because you&#039;ve never had any experience dealing IRL and want to get started in college is a bad idea. <br /><br />you&#039;ll be getting into business with people that have been picking up for years and will test your patience and balls (or lack of) so don&#039;t doubt that for a minute.<br /><br />otherwise good luck i guess..

				Since I am ina good mood I am going to drop some real shit on ya. <br /><br />First off weed isnt worth the time and effort considering the profit. Coke, meth, heroin, crack are probably the most profitable but they are also the highest priority for law enforcement. Plus when you sell very addictive drugs your going to need to be tough and expect the day when someone trys to rip you off. I think a good idea is to get a good connection for lsd, mdma, ghb, or even ketamine. These are all party drugs and they are all low priority for law enforcement. LSD and MDMA are the most profitable unless you are making the GHB yourself from GBL. I would say sell LSD and MDMA because you can still make good money but when the police go looking for a bust even if they know what your doing you are less appealing than someone selling the addicting drugs that police prioritize. <br /><br />Now here is the real shit that you and everyone else should pay attention to................selling online is good if you can do it but selling in real life is more likely but the following applies to anyway you sell........<br /><br />By the time you start making decent cash someone you know will of gotten fucked up by the police and will be looking to snitch on someone to save themselves. Snitches are a dirty type that would turn in ALMOST anyone......<br /><br />The entire time you sell you should strive to have the best shit, you should do your best to have good relationships with each of your customers, and you should never rip off people you fuck with or talk about anyone you have ripped off. <br /><br />When it comes down to it snitches are similar in that even after they snitch they still want good drugs. So when they are trying to figure out who to turn into the police they are going to do their best to protect the dealer with the good shit because its all about getting high. If you got the best shit around and you never did the guy snitchen wrong hes going to be much less likely to snitch on you. I mean fuck the snitch doesn&#039;t wanna lose a good connection. The snitch is going to tell on the guy selling bullshit and doing shady stuff. Most snitches know numerous dealers and if you are their preferred dealer than you will be at the end of the list of people they want to snitch on.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot emphasize my point enough its so true and so many people just don&#039;t get it. If you are selling the best shit and you treat your customers right then even a snitch will value your drugs and services. They don&#039;t want their best hook up to be gone. The best two ways to protect yourself from snitches is by carrying out violent acts on those who have wronged you and by only serving quality shit to your customers. Its much easier to just treat people decent and sell good shit than to commit violent acts. So if your unwilling to prove that your violent and dangerous its a must that you sell the fire and treat your customers well. <br /><br />

				@onestopshop: I take issue with two of your suggestions. First, what is this &quot;ALWAYS ALWAYS PACK if you&#039;re holding&quot; crap? I&#039;ve never owned a weapon in my life, not even a swiss army life, and don&#039;t plan to. Violence begets violence, and begets your ass gettin arrested too. Revenge and violence are never worth it; it&#039;s for the weak and the stupid. As long as you&#039;re kind, dress well (Polo or Nautica, etc., not Bob Marley shirts), avoid shadiness, you will never get into bad situations. <br /><br />Second, I deal all the time while high. Never been a problem. Thank God I was never a big drinker, being a drunk would ruin me fast. Pothead is better lol

				I would not recommend a partner, but workers to separate you from the illegal activities is a good idea, even if it costs you a percentage out of your profit.<br /><br />Some things about workers:<br />1. never work with loudmouth types, they will almost certainly let something slip. try to pick the quiet guys, not the guys who think they are really intelligent but the ones who actually are quite intelligent. They will be happy to work for cash and if you explain everything right they will know how to reduce risk to the bare minimum (this will save you a shitload of time and trouble)<br /><br />2. always always always know where they/their families live.<br /><br />3. they should not know/know of each other if possible, for street retail they will need to know each other in order to operate though.<br /><br />4. you should reward them enough for good work so that they are not being ripped off.<br /><br />5. have muscle so they know they can&#039;t get away with ripping you off etc.. hopefully you will have picked workers with good morals and this shouldn&#039;t be a problem.<br /><br />6. don&#039;t deal with people you deem unprofessional. let your workers know this too and reinforce this rule with stories etc... If your workers are intelligent they will pick up this and concentrate more on the safety of the group than their own/the groups income.<br /><br />7. dont use/let your workers use text messages, even if they say nothing incriminating (just arranging a meet) they are recovered much easier than phonecalls and their meaning can be seen clearly by a judge/jury even when they are just meet arrangements. also switch up phones/numbers often.
