				I&#039;m getting 2 Vicodin pills from my friend and this will be my first time using opiates. What are some precautions I should take? What should I have around before I start? Should I take anything before I start? What should I have in case of emergency?<br /><br />My biggest concern about using them is my lack of prior experience and knowing how I will react to it and if anything goes wrong how can I fix the situation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already decided that since this is my first time, I&#039;d prefer to have someone around me.<br /><br />Thanks for the help, I&#039;ve been doing my reading, but I feel I can get better answers to the questions that I have.

				I assume by Vicodin you have 5/500 hydrocodone/acetaminophen pills?<br />If you&#039;re just taking two, you should be perfectly fine, since 1000mg is the maximum recommended single dose of acetaminophen.<br />Just make sure you don&#039;t have any alcohol in your system before and during use (very dangerous), and take them on an empty stomach for the best effects.<br />I&#039;d suggest having benadryl on you in case you get itchy.<br />In fact, I always take a 25mg benadryl before taking hydrocodone because it potentiates the sedative effects a bit, and removes the itch.<br />I doubt you have much to worry about, just don&#039;t mix them with anything other than a light dose of benadryl and you should be good.<br />Just don&#039;t be disappointed, as 10mg hydrocodone will likely be a very light experience.<br />You should definitely be safe though, enjoy!

				He tells me that they&#039;re 10mg hydrocodone pills w/ acetominophen. I&#039;m picking them up tomorrow and will be able to tell what the dosage is then. <br />I do know not to mix downers, but it&#039;s always good to hear over and over again. <br />Having benadryl sounds like a good idea, I&#039;ll definitely pick some up before I use them. <br />It is reassuring to hear that my probable dosage will okay for me to do. I had done some more reading on Erowid last night and it seemed that even if they turn out to be 20mg Vics, I should still be good.

It takes a LOT more hydrocodone than that to kill you, even as a complete lightweight. The worst you could experience is some nausea and itching, but the benadryl helps with that. The main concern is the acetaminophen, but since you&#039;re taking 2 pills, you&#039;ll be fine.
