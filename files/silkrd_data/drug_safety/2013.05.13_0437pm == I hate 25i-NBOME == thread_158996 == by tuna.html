				I just tripped two nights ago, one tab with my friend and we had to take a xan bar 5 hours later to come down, we slept for 24 hours afterwards haha. <br /><br />I did not know it would build your tolerance for LSD though, that&#039;s interesting. Most acid users seem to not like (hate) the bombs, but i love acid and don&#039;t mind bombs, although obviously i would prefer real LSD its just too expensive compared to 25-i bombs.

				I mean, yes, 25i-NBOME itself is a fine and very visual compound, but LSD is something more to me. So it was kinda disappointing to waste acid only because I had some fun time with 25i-NBOME recently. I was expecting some tolerance to build up, but not the way it did.

				Were you taking MDMA along side the NBOMe? It&#039;s just I can&#039;t see why you&#039;d get tolerance to MDMA from NBOMe since they act in different ways. I can see why you&#039;d get it for LSD though. I guess NBOMe isn&#039;t fully understood yet.<br /><br />Also I&#039;ve heard the tollerance only lasts about 2 weeks. Just chill out for a couple of weeks!
