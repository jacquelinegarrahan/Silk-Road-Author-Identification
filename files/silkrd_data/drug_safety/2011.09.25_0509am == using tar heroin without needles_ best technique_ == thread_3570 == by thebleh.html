				So the only heroin available in my area is black tar. I am used to white china heroin which you simply snort. Unfortunately tar is what I&#039;m stuck with.<br /><br />I don&#039;t shoot up, I don&#039;t use needles, so I&#039;m at a bit of a loss.. I&#039;ve been smoking off tin foil the old chase the dragon technique and it works fairly well but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s very very wasteful.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of eating it, and mixing it with water and snorting it. I&#039;m wasting a lot of money using tin foil and I know its toxic as well. <br /><br />So can anyone help me out with heroin using techniques? There has to be a better way. Thanks!

				I don&#039;t think eating it would be useful. Most of it is broken down by the stomach. Snorting could work. Plugging would probably be best other than shooting if you&#039;re up to it. <br /><br />How well does it dissolve in water? I&#039;ve only had powder H.

				Ah, Man. That shit is really bad for you (I know, Mom, I know). I used to IV it and it was destroying my veins in only a few months. Plus, follow the news, those murdering cartels in mexico do seriously fucked up shit with the money we pay them. Killing is part of the game, sure, but these guy chop off fucking heads and kill inocent people en mass all the time. <br /><br />To answer yer question though. Smoking is really the safest for Tar. It&#039;s really what it is made for, I believe. However, IV Tar can be really good too. It just has to be good enough and filtered EXTREMELY well.<br /><br />I think you should just source yer D from here, Man. Don&#039;t pay any money to those fucked cartels. The Mexican ones I mean (no offense, guys. I actually love Mexico and just want to see the violence there end).

				So this may be a stupid question / solution, but couldn&#039;t you smoke that tar in a glass &quot;oil burner&quot; pipe like people use for meth? You know, the kind of pipe that has a rounded bubble on the end and a small hole in the bubble?&nbsp; That way you could minimize the amount of vaporized tar.&nbsp;

				If it&#039;s good tar you can make what&#039;s called &quot;cheese,&quot; but if it&#039;s not you&#039;ll end up making powder that you have to snort a couple grams to feel anything.&nbsp; Basically all there is to it, is you dissolve the tar in as little water as possible.&nbsp; And when I say as little as possible I mean as little as possible.&nbsp; The more liquid, the more cut/powder it takes to soak it all up and you want your stuff to be fairly potent.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve dissolved the tar, mix in your cut until it absorbs all your dissolved tar.&nbsp; I usually just use a microwavable plate or bowl and an unused credit card.&nbsp; If you do it right, it works quite well.&nbsp; The best cut, imo, is a few roxies, the 15mg or something like that.&nbsp; And in addition to that, to bulk things up a bit more, I crush up a few cimetadine pills as well(tagamet).&nbsp; The upside to that, is that the cimetadine potentiates the heroin.&nbsp; Just be careful what you&#039;re cutting it with.&nbsp; Sometimes adding a little benadryl or dextromethorphan can potentiate the high as well, but just make sure you use very little of those two.&nbsp; Otherwise you&#039;ll end up taking way too much benadryl or dextromethorphan and that&#039;s no fun.&nbsp; If you find you&#039;ve used too much water and are having to add too much powder, just put whatever you&#039;ve got in the microwave for a while.&nbsp; You want to use real low power for a long time.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want anything to burn or start sizzling, just enough heat to aid the evaporation.&nbsp; Use something like power level 2 or 3 for a decent amount of time.<br /><br />Secondly, you can go to walgreen&#039;s and buy a bottle of saline solution for your nose.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically just salt water with an apparatus on the end for misting the stuff into your nose.&nbsp; You can dissolve your tar in that and then just use it like you normally would.&nbsp; Be sure to start with the smallest amount of liquid possible, you can always add more if it&#039;s too strong.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions.

I know. But it just doesn&#039;t really work. <br />The trick is using the thin foil, a fairly large piece completely flatened, and a lighter with a low flame.

Also, the tar fucks up the visiibility inside the glass ball at once. You really need to be able to see and follow the trail to make it worth it.

				Other than the dragon on the foil technique, which is fun but not as tasty as it is for good meth (not to mention just what new compounds are created when you overdo it and AL is combined with your D?), a little water and up your nose works fine.<br /><br />It&#039;s been years but we used to find Visine bottles that had a pull out dropper and straw instead of the kind with just a dropper.<br />Mix as much water as you think you need. That means how strong is your D and how often do you find yourself back at the bottle? Don&#039;t want to overdo it.<br />Start with a little and see what you D/water ratio ends up being.<br /><br /><br />BTW, the violence in Mexico would go away (at least in this area) if the goddamn US of fucking A would stop this stupis war on drugs.<br />But when so many bureaucrats have so much tax revenue to gain, and guns and toys to buy with it, it won&#039;t happen.........probably not even if Ron Paul got in.

				You look up heroin on Wikipedia, they&#039;ve now put up a whole paragraph on &#039;plugging&#039;.&nbsp; Not as social as fixing with yer buds, and can expose you to ridicule and shame if you get caught trying different positions while looking in the mirror....*but* it works! ... and if you are at all old-school about heroin, you know just how wretched tar is for injecting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen two guys now, who had that flesh eating crap, where the skin was gone, and you could see their bones and shit.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t seen, but I&#039;ve heard of amputees...not to mention, if those terrible things don&#039;t happen, your veins get destroyed quickly.<br /><br />Plugging is the way to go.&nbsp; Get a 3cc rig (or bigger) with a removable point, and thro the point away.&nbsp; Put the tar in spoon with a little water, and heat it up, same as to fix, then thru a cotton in the spoon and suck it up...run it under cold water a few seconds so it cools off, then plug away (you can thro some lubricant on barrel if u r so incline)&nbsp; ... then I go lay down a few minutes and feel the &#039;come on&#039; and all&#039;s well.<br /><br />It also seems to satisfy, enough, that craving that needle junkys have.&nbsp; We just want to fiddle with the shit and mess with rigs, so with this you can do all that, and still get pretty close to a rush, IMHO...about the same as snorting, not quite as good as fixing, but way less complications....<br /><br />Save yer veins for powder, or parole officer inspections....<br /><br />You can always go to opiophile.org: they&#039;ve got into on all kinds of good stuff like this, some impossibly hilarious threads on plugging, and the various positions assumed when we thought no one was looking...not the sort of thing you want to tell mom about, but what is?

				You should check out the wikipedia article &quot;Chasing the dragon&quot;, especially the &quot;Technique&quot; chapter.<br />Also follow the link &quot;How to Smoke Heroin&quot; if you need some extra info.<br />I have seen a lot of wasteful smokers, but if you are not completely fucked you should be able to smoke with about 95% efficiency after some practice.<br />
