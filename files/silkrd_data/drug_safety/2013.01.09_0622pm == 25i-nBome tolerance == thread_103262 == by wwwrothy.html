				How long are you waiting between trips? most people agree at least a week, but a fortnight is better. If yo are really burnt out maybe a month or two might do?

				yea i went pretty hard as the ever since i had the best trip of my life. i gotta chill at this point, for atleast a month im guessing. this stuff is like mdma where you cant just take it everyday while stuff like lsd just builds and builds (the new goal=find pure lsd, as i have samples coming). this is an amazing chemical though....

				ah see, i dont believe that to be true. When I had my run with nbome, it was definitely more of a euphoric, mdma/crazy ass weird psychedelic. I doubt that if i get some quality hit os pure lsd in the mail, my brain will short circuit some 25i that i dosed, and cause all my lsd to be as dead as my burnt out 25x effects. dissociatives sure dont have any type of tolerance like that. <br /><br />what does anyone else think? I know guys in my past who tripped on lsd daily as each was great even if they had to raise their dose a little.<br /><br />Maybe when i get my next check ill go for pure mescaline, shrooms, and lsd. im thinking of leaving the nbome&#039;s alone for a very, very good while.<br /><br />let me know if ya&#039;ll have any experience with this.<br /><br />should have some MXE in today :-D<br /><br />roth
