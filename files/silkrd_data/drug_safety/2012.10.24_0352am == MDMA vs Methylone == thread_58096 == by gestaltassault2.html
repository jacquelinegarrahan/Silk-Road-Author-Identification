				I&#039;ve done MDMA lots of times before but I&#039;ve never done methylone...how does it feel compared to MDMA? Can you tell the difference between MDMA and methylone based on the effects alone?

				I have been wondering the same thing as well. Researched a bit on the clearnet about methylone, all I know is that they&#039;re different when it comes to safety as well as actual response to the drug when taken between person to person. Methylone has a short history but has already has reports of dangerous situations. But then again there are many reports that say it was a very pleasant experience. Read up, and make a good educated decision for yourself is the best bet.

				I&#039;ve used both many times, methylone makes me &quot;roll,&quot; and I can be fucked up and have a great night, but I take more methylone than I&#039;d take mdma to achieve the same kind of experience. Methylone is also a bit more speedy I feel like. But if I&#039;m not mistaken it plays off your serotonin about a thrid as much as mdma does. -&gt; less of a hangover? quite possibly.

				I&#039;ve seen more experiences where Methylone is a &quot;morey&quot; drug, where you want to make repeat doses, so keep that in mind that a drug is different for everyone. Some will make you want more and its all about self control at that point. But I could also be wrong so its all on the individual basis IMO.

				bk-mdma (m1/methylone) is more speedy, but needed in much higher doses. <br /><br />i easily take 400-500 mg&#039;s of m1 all at once for my first parachute, and throughout the night i would take like two to three 200-300 mg doses. everyone is so convinced that m1 is real mdma where im at, and their all used to taking high doses, so say we see some real mdma come through where i&#039;m at then i&#039;d be pretty worried about the hard asses around here that think they can handle high doses, but you really can&#039;t compare the two in my opinion, the m1 is just nowhere near the love mdma gives you, and not only that but the m1 keeps you up when you try to sleep, and you get ALOT more hallucinations. <br />\<br /><br />all in all mdma over m1 anyday, you can&#039;t even compare the 2.

				Lolwut?!<br />&nbsp;<br />Okay, the ILF on many occasions has been sold Methylone as MDMA, both in pressies and in capsules, at approximately 100mg per dose.&nbsp; The general response to that amount is, &quot;Oh, this feels ... okay.&nbsp; Hmmm, maybe let&#039;s watch a movie?&nbsp; Or just chill.&quot;&nbsp; All members of the ILF and its friends have felt that way.&nbsp; It&#039;s always been a nothing drug, a very easily identifiable non-Ecstasy.&nbsp; Its best asset seems to be that it can let you sit through an entire movie and not need to smoke a cigarette.&nbsp; <br /><br />But what JackBoii and others are talking about, a rolling-like feeling you get at higher doses, is completely unheard-of in our circles!&nbsp; EXCEPT for the one time we got a pill with Methylone and Butylone in it, and that, to be honest, was a pretty good roll.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ILF blames dishonesty for these problems.&nbsp; Seriously, why lie about what&#039;s in the pill (or on the blotter --- 25i sold as acid, gross!)!

				Methylone was kind of uncomfortable. There definitely is a moreishness to it and there&#039;s this anxiety that isn&#039;t there with MDMA.<br /><br />However, most serotonergenic cathinones, such as methylone and mephedrone, are DAMN AMAZING when taken after MDMA. Try it sometime... take a regular dose of MDMA, say .15 or so, and then 2 hours later start bumping methylone. The rush comes back so nicely.

				I find myself redosing more off m1 and tend to end un comfortable later on in the night because of redosing. Definably moreish, but i wouldn&#039;t say fiendish.&nbsp; I also noticed that m1 messes up my temp than MDMA so if i can afford MDMA i&#039;m going to grab some. Also, m1 feels more stimulating and sometimes feels forced, which normally lead to jaw clenching, grinding teeth etc. (Have some gum.) I&#039;ve also found MDMA comes in waves as m1 is more predictable and you can differentiate l the onset, peak, and come down more easy with m1. Which kind of takes away some of the experience personally. I have noticed that m1 doesn&#039;t get me as depressed as MDMA does the few days after use. I would probably do more m1 if i could find the batch i had the first two times that didn&#039;t have ill side effects.
