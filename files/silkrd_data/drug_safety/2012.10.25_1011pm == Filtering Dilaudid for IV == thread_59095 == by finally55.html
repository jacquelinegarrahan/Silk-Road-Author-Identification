				I bought one of these 0.45 Micron wheel filters cause I figured it&#039;d be safer than cotton. What I&#039;ve read about the Dilaudid pills (mine say &quot;4&quot; on one side and &quot;M&quot; on the other - they are round and white, with no coating) is that they have very little fillers in them. No APAP, so no need to CWE. But I think there must still be some binders in there - the water is always cloudy.<br /><br />Going through cotton I can pull up a pretty clear dose. With the wheel filter, I just don&#039;t want to leave too much good stuff behind. Can anyone comment on this?<br /><br />Also - I got the 0.45 Micron because that&#039;s what they had... Not sure if that&#039;s the right...&quot;number&quot;...or not...?<br /><br />Oh - I just ordered some 8MG dillies too but they&#039;re not here yet. In the photo they look different than the 4s - kinda heart-shaped, with an &quot;8&quot; on one side and an &quot;M&quot; on the other, with a vertical line through the M, presumably for splitting. I am assuming these will be fine to bang as well&nbsp; -anyone have any intel to the contrary?

				How I used to bang Dilaudid pills:<br />- Crush the pill into a powder (doesn&#039;t have to be real fine) into the spoon you&#039;re going to use.<br />- Add just a few drops of saline to the powder, just enough to make a paste.<br />- Using a syringe plunger, mix the diluadid paste till smooth.<br />- Add the extra saline solution, however much you would normally use.<br />- Let it sit in the spoon for a few minutes (do not use heat, it will disolve too many binders), just let it chill. <br />- You will notice a layer form on top of the solution. Use the plunger to push this to the side of the spoon so that it does not get drawn up.<br />- There will be another layer of filler at the bottom of the spoon. You can drop your cotton on the clean side of the spoon and draw carefully, leaving much of the fillers stuck to the spoon.

				The way I&#039;ve always done it isn&#039;t the safest but I have never had any health problems because of it.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean I won&#039;t in time this is just my experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;I crush the dilly put it in the spoon add about 1 cc of water to the powder, I use my needle cap to stir everything up until it is mostly dissolved and then heat the spoon just until I see bubbles.&nbsp; Then I drop in the cotton and suck her up.&nbsp; then I add about a drop or two of clean water to the cotton and suck that up to flush out the cotton.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried several differen&#039;t methods for shooting dilly&#039;s and this is the easiest for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried the past method and the micron filters and either way the high I get is all the same.&nbsp; So anything left over is pretty miniscule and doesn&#039;t really effect how high you get.&nbsp; Once again though my method is probably most definitely the safest or healthiest.&nbsp; As for the 8mg dilly&#039;s if i&#039;m not mistaken any opiate with an M on it is made by malinkrockt pharm. (sp?) and all their dilaudids are IR (IVable)

				just want to agree with SB, definitely dont heat pills when youre going to shoot opis- all it does is pull more fillers into the solution

				Almost all if not all formulations of hydromorphone in pill form contain either microcrystalline cellulose (this is aspirated into your syringe and injected and the crystals can even lodge into brain cells at high speed after traveling the bloodstream, causing cell death in some cases), or magnesium stearate which is also horrible for your cardiovascular system when aspirated and injected. It&#039;s important to use 0.22 micron wheel filters and push extra water through them after filtering to get all the product out of the filter and into the clean syringe for the shot.<br />

				.45 is not good enough. Use .22 micron 25mm you can get 100 for around 80 bucks from tisch scientific.&nbsp; Get the cellulose kind.&nbsp; You can only use them once.&nbsp; Also hydromorphone is hydrophilic so you dont need to heat it up although using sterile water is a good idea.&nbsp; The generic 8 mg tabs are full of binder.&nbsp; If you have insurance get the the real diliudid not the generic&nbsp; it is a huge difference.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mainline because I use it for medicinal purposes. I have stenosis of the spine and give myself IM injections using 25 gauge needle.&nbsp;
