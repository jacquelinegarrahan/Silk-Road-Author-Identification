				Ive been using opiates for a while now but recently i scored a bag of tan powder dope IRL off a new dealer. dope was ok, not the best, not the worst. id grade it a C-. Anyway, the deeper i got into this bag the more offensive it smelt, it got to the point where if i smelt the unopened bag it was being held in i would vomit because the smell was so bad. it smelt like concentrated cat piss, not faintly, like full on cat piss. it was so bad i had to plug my nose with paper towels in order to handle it without vomiting. What could be the cause of this? i have never experienced anything like this with dope. i noticed when i got the bag he wrapped it up 5 times so maybe it was at one point swallowed but then the bag would just smell not the dope its self, right? so i donno. ANYBODY KNOW WHY MY DOPE SMELLS LIKE CAT PISS!?!???! thanks :)

				Most Black Tar Heroin smells like cat urine. When I was using tar, the cat piss smell was usually a good sign. For BTH anyway. I&#039;m not sure what chemical it is that makes it smell like that though.
