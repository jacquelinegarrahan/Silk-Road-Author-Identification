				Never to my knowledge have I smoked PCP.&nbsp; But I had a friend who came to me &amp; said his connect has been doing that to make more money and act like its some superior strain. It just makes me wonder how common that shit is, and i pretty much assume no one does that here though.

				nobody would do that because pcp is too expensive and the dealer would be losing money. that&#039;s an old rumor that they told me at my treatment facility when i was 14.. i think they actually did that a long time ago but not in todays day of age.

				The worst i&#039;ve seen at a grow up is when the buds are half way matured, the growers would sprinkle cut glass into the bud to add weight and aesthetics, then allow the buds to continue to grow around the glass. But never another drug, especially not PCP!

				I&#039;ve heard this pcp laced weed bullshit for years, I mean c&#039;mon, why would they &#039;secretly&#039; provide you with extra drugs you didn&#039;t pay for...<br /><br />Shady weed dealers do lots of other things though, sticking pennies in brick weed to up the weight, sprinkling various salts on nugs is something I&#039;ve personally witnessed in fact had a very nasty falling out with an ex-dealer who sold me an oz of nugs that he didn&#039;t think I would realize had been sprinkled with seasoning salt...like I can&#039;t obviously smell it or see it mixed in with the shake.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about dealers doing something like spraying soda on nugs so they&#039;re sticky and weigh more? I&#039;m hazy on the details, probably read it on grass city or something years ago.<br /><br />The most common trick is doing the orange peel or water process in how you fluff up compressed buds, to an extent it weighs considerably more but the buds then seem like they need to be cured longer.

But this dude said he actually saw the guy doing it to a quarter he was about to sell. My first inclination was who the fuck is this guy and who are the idiots buying from him (although he does deal out of the ghetto so I can understand who his clientele is).
