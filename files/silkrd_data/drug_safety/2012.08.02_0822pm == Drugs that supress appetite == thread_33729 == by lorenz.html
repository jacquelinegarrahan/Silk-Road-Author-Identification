				What are the drugs which have a marked appetite suppressant effect? <br /><br />Is heroin a good pick? Cocaine? Mushrooms? LSD?

				I never eat on MDMA or LSD, I get sick to my stomach. I get sick to my stomach when I eat on shrooms too, but I do it every time to the point of vomiting because food tastes so damn good when I&#039;m tripping on shrooms. May I ask why you&#039;re interested in this, just out of curiosity?

				Speed/amphetamines, especially methamphetamines. Any drug used constantly will eventually become easier to eat on, though. Tripping on anything makes eating &#039;weird&#039; but if you trip all the time you get over the fact that your sandwich may be dancing and singing and you just slaughter that delicious motherfucker with your mouth. <br />Cigarettes, meth, speed, lsd, shrooms, coke

				If you are looking for something that will supress your appetite without a lot of side effects, you should try modafinil. It is a stimulant but it doesn&#039;t really have a buzz to it at all. Think of it as a super strong version of caffeine,...

				In my limited experience with all things psychoactive, LSD definitely suppresses the appetite. I took 2.5mg at midnight on Friday and didn&#039;t eat till 10 AM Sunday.<br /><br />As stated above this was because I wasn&#039;t in a position to prepare or eat food in that time though, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend for weight loss or anything like that, unless you can afford to spend your life in your room contemplating whether you are on your bed, or are part of your bed...<br /><br />At more normal doses I find savory foods are hard to eat, but fruit is amazing.

				It would be silly to take LSD or any other psychedelic for the sole purpose of suppressing your appetite.<br /><br />For me LSD has a contradictory effect when respect to appetite. It often makes me hungry, but when I try to eat, I feel sick to my stomach.<br /><br />If I wanted to suppress my appetite, I&#039;d take amphetamine. It is much more effective than psychedelics.<br />

				Someone who isn&#039;t me lost quite a bit of weight, quickly, from cocaine. She didn&#039;t eat at all for days.&nbsp; And not on a binge, just bumping most of the day instead of eating.<br /><br />No, its not wise.&nbsp; Just letting you know what she did.

				I would just stick to caffeine and other stimulants seem to strong for the sole purpose of suppressing your appetite. The best way is to do small doses (50-65mg) and eating meals when wearing off. I would also recommend getting coconut virgin caps to boost up your metabolism, they&#039;ll make you more hungry but with the small doses of caffeine and small meals throughout the days you&#039;ll lose weight and have energy (I would also recommend a super b-complex vitamin).

				Cigarettes. Not only do they supress your appetite, but they cost so fucking much you can&#039;t afford to eat even if you want to!!

				Ephedrine.<br /><br />http://centurysupplements.com/ephedrine-hcl-150-tabs/<br /><br />I buy them there, nobody sells the kaizen brand on SR.. the stuff they sell on SR seems way too strong for what I&#039;m looking for.

				any illegal drug that isn&#039;t cannabis will suppress your appetite, but as someone above said - the more you do it the easier it is to eat on it. i can quite happily eat full meals on mandy and coke now.<br /><br />but also as someone above said - it&#039;s not worth doing illegal drugs just to suppress your appetite. someone i know drinks a pint of water every time they get hungry if it isn&#039;t a meal time - she says thats pretty good for fighting hunger. and drinking more water isn&#039;t going to be bad for you
