				While doing personal research, and trying to convince my friend who will drink, smoke (pot, cigarrettes, cigars), chew dip but refuse to do anything that is actually worth while/non addictive, such as MDMA<br /><br />I stumbled across what I consider to be the best drug information video in a while. <br /><br />http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6108672696241807159<br /><br />I liked the video for a few reasons:<br />-They didn&#039;t pay attention to the legality of the drug<br />-They showed how and why certain drugs are bad, not just propaganda bull shit<br />-Showing how certain substances can lead to what I would consider to be &quot;true&quot; problems<br />-Exposing how we accept certain drugs as part of everyday occurrences, while others are shown as the devil&#039;s weapon<br /><br /><br />It did lack on alot of more popular drugs, and is slightly outdated. Also, the UK perspective was a tad bit confusing from a US viewer. I did feel they were pretty harsh on cannabis, but again, looking at it scientifically. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m interested in what you think about the video. <br /><br />I wonder what would happen if we dropped everything for drug&#039;s legality, and just decided to do a &quot;re-list&quot; of what was considered illegal, and what wasn&#039;t<br /><br />Input?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Great find, was a very interesting watch!<br /><br />One thing to note, I believe that if Meth was more relatively common in the UK, I think it may have appeared in the top 5 due to the dependancy it can build etc..<br />Without &quot;ruining the plot&quot;, when the number 2 most dangerous drug was getting announced, I was certain that it was going to be Meth.<br /><br />FYI I do use meth from time to time, however the method these scientists used to rank the drugs has given me more reason to space out my meth usage...

I have a hell of a stash, but I plan to space it out.

				The &#039;newer&#039; BBC &#039;how drugs work&#039; series is much better imo.. Here&#039;s the ep about mdma (xtc):<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTJaH79pskU
