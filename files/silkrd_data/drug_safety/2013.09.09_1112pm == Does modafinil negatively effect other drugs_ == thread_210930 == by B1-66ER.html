				Interesting question. I&#039;ve considered the reverse but not this. I started looking into this and adrafinil because some friends have had some pretty good results with the alternative adrafinil. With just looking up the half-life of modafinil(adrafinil&#039;s is much shorter), I would at least suggest waiting out 4-5 half-lifes (half-life at 12-15 hours so playing it safe we&#039;re talking 60-75 hours). That said, you could probably get away with earlier but if at all possible I would push for later. Disclaimer: I&#039;ve done only little research on it but, half-lifes being what they are, I think going by that should be a reasonably safe bet (if you&#039;re not in too much of a hurry I&#039;d encourage waiting a week). <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				I tried to take cocaine with an active modafinil tolerance and it completely blocked it&#039;s effects. I was thinking it would have a negative impact on other drugs too.

				Well just FYI, I got prescribed modafinil along with another drug to treat my coke addiction. So it would make sense that they cancel out. It was not the original purpose of modafinil but it certainly has killed my coke cravings and helped with withdrawals along with the other drug I&#039;m taking (baclofen). <br /><br />-dC

				That actually is a very interesting alternative application for the substance. <br /><br />As it was developed to treat conditions like narcolepsy and chronic fatigue (off label) reducing any cravings for other stimulants like cocaine seems promising. <br /><br />I suppose this warrants further research, especially into dealing with addiction to stimulant drugs like crystal meth. If it proves to reduce cravings for those as well this hardly recognized drug may have great potential.

And do believe there already a few studies that have been done with alcohol and possibly other drugs too, I&#039;d have to double-check. The Modafinil is great but I don&#039;t think it would be effective alone for a chronic user, like I was. The combination with Balcoflen is what makes it really nice and so far I am cold turkey off coke for 72 hours now with minimal withdrawals (just a few sporadic headaches) and cravings

Weed is less couch-locky, and people claim to get stronger MDMA/LSD trips.

				In my opinion, its best to not mix any of these &#039;new&#039; drugs with any real drug. Cannabis would fine&nbsp; - Modafinil would either make it stronger (great) or less stronger (sucks)<br /><br />As for coke, speed, MDMA, I don&#039;t know because although I have sampled some pharm grade modafinil - I never really thought of it as being much use as your neither high or low - just maybe more alert, but in a spaced out kinda way I thought.<br /><br />So mixing it with other drugs I&#039;d say its a bad idea.<br /><br />And who knows what it does with the legal pharms or the legal RCs. Your taking a a chance and I doubt modafinil would make coke or MDMA any better - in fact your coke and MDMA must be shit to even think of adding some other drug on board.<br /><br />

				I suppose modafinil could be considered an intermediate upper. It works better than coffee, but doesn&#039;t really have the full effects that amphetamine does. <br /><br />Also, it is not a novelty drug, the substance has been known for years and prescribed clinically. <br /><br />The interactions and combinations could be interesting though. Especially with cannabis: i wonder if it just takes the sluggishness out of the equation, or also influences things like panic episodes. This is not really about making cannabis stronger or weaker, but more about what part of its effects are enhanced or inhibited. <br /><br />
