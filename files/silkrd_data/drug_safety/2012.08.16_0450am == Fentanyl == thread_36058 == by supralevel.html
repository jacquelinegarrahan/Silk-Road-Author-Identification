				Fentanyl is a playmate that is very strong indeed.<br /><br />What would you say about it compared to heroin (smoke heroine)<br /><br />I myself would say that fentanyl maybe is even stronger than heroin (I dont have very much experience tho)<br /><br />Fentanyl coming like patches (non gel I found easy to smoke. My way of smoking them is probably wasting some product - I just put a cut of it on thinfoil(householdfoil) and burn it under. <br /><br />I have found different brands to be better or worse I like the last I have giving of a white smoke and melting on the thin foil to look something like heroin does. The taste is better than expected but sure some poison gases may be realeased a reason to not smoke to much of this.<br /><br />The feeling when smoking a fair ammount of fentanyl is strong. Effects hitting in 10 seconds and very fast transcends you into a state of euphoria. Lust, orgasmic feeling, life seems bright and happy suddenly.<br /><br />I have a good disipline being able to have drugs available in large quantities but not need to use them.<br />I admit that fentanyl is stressing this matters.<br />Its to damn good <br /><br /><br />I have some questions - extraction is it a good idea?<br />Smoking it more effectively?<br /><br />Safety - This is really important. Fentanyl can kill if overdosed and its said to be easy.<br />Its important that if you feel that you may have OD, dont be alone! Get you some coffe, dont fall asleep!<br /><br />Do you have any ideas about how to improve safety?<br />I would like to store naloxone or some other antidot.<br /><br />At the moment I have norspan patches - I think it will be an antidot also?<br />Maybe it can work to smoke but better would be to have a syringe ready to IM it,<br /><br />An important rule is not to mix this with other depressant drugs!!! IMPORTANT!

				I&#039;ve never tried fent but have plenty of experience with opiates. Fentanyl is 100x stronger than morphine while heroin is only 2-3x. However, that is analgesic strength. Not euphoria. Everything I&#039;ve read suggests most people find heroin more euphoric than fentanyl. Plus fentanyl has a super short half life and due to its dosage being in micrograms, it is very easy to go over. It is often considered the crack of opiates. Some of its analogues are 1000s of times stronger than morphine. The Russians even used carfentanil as a biological warfare agent in the form of a chemical gas... Against their own freaking people.

				From what I have heard Fentanyl is by far the least enjoyable opiate around and it seems to have been engineered to be a powerful painkiller without the normal fun opiate side effects. <br /><br />The last discussion of Fentanyl use that I was a party to pretty much ended with a friend of mine in the states chipping in that everyone he&#039;s ever known that deliberately took Fentanyl recreationaly ended up dead within six months. Most of the &#039;killer batches&#039; of H kill people because they are cut with Fentanyl. <br /><br />The potential for ODing is extremely high (can you tell the difference between 100 and 200 micrograms just by looking ?) and the recreational effects are meh at best. Steer well clear quite frankly.

				I don&#039;t think fentanyl is more expensive to produce than heroin considering its a full synthetic. No need to farm poppies... Of course these guys aren&#039;t scraping up patches or anything either.

				actually black sheep i think you are mistaken. just because it&#039;s synthetic doesnt mean poppies are needed. they are absolutely needed from my underrstanding. most modern pharmaceutical opiods nowadays are all synthesized from Thebaine . Even alot of morphine pills are actually synthesized from thebaine despite the fact that NATURAL morphine exists in poppies. what it seems the pharm companes are doing is growing acres and acres of this Thebaine rich Poppies that are low in morphine because a) it&#039;s cheaper for higher yield b) it makes it cheaper for them to product various opiods products all from the same base compound. if a pharm company only has to buy one type of poppy to get the base compound that will synthesize all sorts of wonderful opiods they will definitely chose that route. thebaine can synthesize pretty much all useful opiods: morphine, codine, oxycodone, buprenorphine, oxymorpone, naloxone, etc.<br /><br />anywho. take care everyone.

				I looked up a fentanyl synthesis and the precursor is N-Phenethyl-Piperidone. I&#039;m pretty sure they don&#039;t start with poppies... same with methadone. A dose of methadone costs less than a dollar for clinics... Its all about money.<br /><br />Morphine is indeed farmed from poppies and not made from thebaine. It&#039;s even methylated to make codeine. There is such small amounts of codeine naturally present in poppies that it&#039;s not worth harvesting.<br /><br />You are right that thebaine is used to make a lot of compounds including hydrocodone, oxycodone, and the notorious bentley compounds such as etorphine.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure though its not used to make morphine, fent, and methadone.

				I&nbsp; wouldn&#039;t want speculate how expensive Fentanyl is to produce compared to Heroin, thats something well beyond my sphere of experience. However, I do know for certain that it gets cut into Heroin. Some time in 2006 a batch like that killed people across a dozen cities. <br /><br />My guess is that while it may cost more for the same weight to produce Fentanyl, its extreme potency means that on a per-dose basis it is cheaper or at least the same, assuming you have a friendly chemist to do it. <br /><br />From what I gather the reason that for cutting H with Fentanyl is because it means that you can step on it a lot harder. Now, these numbers are just for the sake of argument, but if you&#039;ll follow my logic:<br /><br />A 0.2g bag of street H consist of 0.1g of H and 0.1g of sundry crap.<br /><br />Now fentanyl is about 10 times as potent as H. So, for equivalent effects to 0.1g of H, you need 0.01g of Fentanyl.<br /><br />Obviously any reasonable dealer doesn&#039;t want their customers getting pissed that they aren&#039;t really getting high, but they do want to stretch their product out and make more money. <br /><br />So, they can make a 0.2g bag that contains 0.05g of H, 0.005g of fentanyl and 0.145g of cut. Your customers probably can&#039;t tell the difference, and suddenly you are using 50% less H. <br /><br />Now, for that original batch you would need 500g of H to make 1kg of product. However, if you can cut with fentanyl, you need 250g of H and 25g of fentanyl. Now, if that 25g is available for less than the cost of 250g of H, then that makes economic sense.<br /><br />The reason why &#039;killer batches&#039; end up being so is not because of unforseen extreme potency, its because users expect to be nodding out and feeling that deep warm euphoria that characterizes a shot of H. They don&#039;t get that. So they figure that the product sucks and have another dose, maybe a bigger one. Then they die, and they still didn&#039;t get high. Alternatively if you cut with H and then it doesn&#039;t get mixed properly, someone who thinks they are shooting 100mg of H ended up shooting 100mg of fentanyl and thats a lot. <br /><br /><br />

				To end the discussion if poppies are needed:<br />Fenanyl and its analog is not a semisynthetic drugs that need poppies like starting materials.<br /><br />About the thing you mention that fentanyl is less euphoric - what are peoples suggestion on this one?<br /><br />I bet it may be individual diffenrences. I at least can say that if you say that fentanyl isnt euphoric at all you really are a gourmet of drugs.<br /><br />Smoking fentanyl right now I doesn&#039;t exactly say it sucks.... oh no. As I say I feel on this one it could be possible for me to lose control.<br /><br />That was also what I wanted to be discussed here not if fentanyl maybe is a little less euphoric than heroine. I myself have had far better experiences on fentanyl than heroine. But I may not had the best quality of H. Some users I have read claims smoking fentanyl is comparable to injecting H. But I have my doubt - but saying it isnt euphoric - what kind of world do you live in????<br /><br />One of the strongest mu - agonist in the world ISNT EUPHORIC ENOUGH????

				I have certainly heard that H subjectively feels better than Fentanyl, H having more euphoria, fentanyl having more sedation but such things are certainly highly personal. As a random guess (cuz whats the internet for if not rampant speculation) I would say that most people who use fentanyl got there via using H for an extended period of time and so do have quite well developed tastes, and who probably would use H if they had the choice, so there is some bias. <br /><br />Of course if you are accustomed to kinda crappy H, then fentanyl might well feel &#039;better&#039; to you. Everything is a question of prior experience, the dosages in question and your tolerance at the time. <br /><br />Personally, while I have been interested in fentanyl (I think every opiate user has been curious) I still think its far too dangerous for me to want to use. Even if someone could factually state that it will always feel like turbo-awesome-super-H, I&#039;m at a point where I&#039;m pretty certain that my occasional H usage won&#039;t kill me, but that fentanyl might well do.

				I just went through a 50mcg/ph watson gel patch yesterday, and im not impressed at all. I smoked the gel on foil. I was worried about a possible od so I started small and smoked more and more until i felt good, i went through about half the patch before that happened, and the buzz didnt last very long at all. <br /><br />I used the rest of the gel buccally or (rubbed on my gums) and smoked a little more. Barely got a buzz. My tolerance is pretty high, but i expected more. Not sure if i was wasting the gel or not, but i was getting no smoke when i exhaled, and again barely got buzzed. Wont be trying fentanyl again, unless im prescribed it or its free (or maybe if its very cheap, lol).

				I hate fentanyl. It is probably one of my least favorite opiates next to morphine sulfate. Fent has very little euphoria and glow and way too much respiratory depression. Take H over it any day of the week.
