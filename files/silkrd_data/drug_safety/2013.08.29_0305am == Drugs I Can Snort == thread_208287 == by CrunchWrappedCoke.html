Good to know that it&#039;s something I don&#039;t want in my nose.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to thank the people who have responded so far. At this stage now I&#039;m just seeing if there are alternatives/substitutes to cocaine due to the price. <br /><br />How often would I have to be snorting substances to cause damage to my nose? I typically use coke once or twice a month.

				Keep your drug use under control and your nose will be fine with 1-2gs of cocaine a month. I&#039;ve seen people go through 2 ounces a week of (cut) cocaine for at least a year and they still had their nose&#039;. I&#039;ve also seen huge k &amp; mephedrone dependencies where going through up to about an ounce a week wouldn&#039;t be unheard of (for over a year at least). They may have their nose but after all that your head will be a little shot...<br /><br />Your body will tell you when it&#039;s time to stop it&#039;s just a matter of listening to it and not giving into the cravings.

It&#039;s definitely a party drug for me. But I definitely agree with the &quot;your body will tell you when it&#039;s time to stop&quot;. I can only do so much before it stops being fun and I stop before I reach that point. My friend who got into yay would go on 2-3 day binges with nearly nonstop use and then crash and repeat. It was crazy to watch and showed me what not to do because as nice as it is, it didn&#039;t seem like a fun lifestyle to me.

				I&#039;ve sniffed enough substances in my time and I&#039;m pretty sure that i haven&#039;t done any major damage to my nose but then everyone is different. When you wake up every morning and you&#039;ve got blocked nose and then blood in your mucus that&#039;s when you have to worry. To be honest though a lot of people by that stage simply are not bothered about their nose because the drugs can have such a hold. Again though, I&#039;ve seen loads of people who got to this stage who are now perfectly fine but that may just be down to luck.<br /><br />Like you said you know when to stop, it&#039;s just maintaining the willpower that becomes the issue after a certain period of using almost anything. Try not to up your dosages as well because that&#039;s usually when it&#039;s time to stop. Once tolerance builds up the drugs loose their charm and you then have the task of trying to re-wire the fuckers back to normal life which isn&#039;t fun

				Yea. I take a daily stimulant pill for ADHD, so good/bad for me in the sense I don&#039;t have any withdrawal symptoms and don&#039;t have an awful comedown like other people might. I also understand the power of stimulants and that there is a fine line between having fun and having a bad time. The bad is probably that I have a high tolerance to start, so my lines are probably bigger and less effective in some ways, although yay is the strongest thing I&#039;ve had compared to the scrip stims I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />My willpower comes in the form that I take stimulants as medication. It&#039;s fun to get high on coke and whatnot, but I also get sick of being on stimulants for most of the week and most of the time I&#039;d rather drink or smoke some weed to relieve stress and anxiety. The coke is for easy weeks with limited stress when I want to be wired and can have fun doing it. Or if I need a little extra bump of focus for an hour or so.

				And another thing i stupidly didn&#039;t mention:<br />Coke can definitely also be corrosive to your sinuses. <br />It&#039;s not a &quot;safer alternative&quot; to meth by any means, it&#039;s just a generally more pleasant insufflation experience.<br />Sorry I failed a bit there&nbsp; :(

I&#039;d rather snort mdma even though it hurts than putting it in rizla... Which means I&#039;m stupid and my nose will be fucked up soon....<br /><br />Probably most stuff is best to be used orally or by smoking/vaporising.

				I&#039;ll look into mephedrone. How would you compare the high and effects of it to yay? How long is the high?

MDMA = serotonin and cocaine releases dopamine).<br />So it&#039;s like a mild mix of cocaine &amp; MDMA comeup and a really good feeling for a couple of minutes. Then it fades away a bit and feels like a mild cocaine &amp; mild MDMA combination.<br />Very good to party with, but you need to keep redosing which is a pain. Plus there is a bit of a burn when snorting it, compared to very little burn with cocaine.<br /><br />I usually need to have another line of Mephedrone every 30 - 45 minutes. When it wears away you feel pretty crap and really want tanother line to keep it going.<br />But after about 8 - 10 hours, each additional line is going to do very little and you need to just stop. Take a xanax / benzo and sleep for a few hours and you&#039;ll feel ok when you wake up.

				Have to agree Dingo. Mephedrone is my preferred stimulant, great for snorting as well as bombing. But yes, once you start you always want one more line. I find the best way to deal with it is to smoke weed...it works sometimes. of course you can just give in and have more. Incidently, having been snorting methylone lately in place of mephedrone, not as good but not bad either. Pleasant to snot and fuck it gets me horny. Redosing can be a problem also!!

Cathinones for some reason give people a strong urge to redose whilst on it, but aren&#039;t actually that addictive, like cocaine.<br />It&#039;s impossible to describe... I think it might have something to do with how quickly the high from mephedrone drops off. The rush is so g ood, then you feel good for 30 - 40 minutes and all of a sudden you feel pretty average / crap. No gradual decrease. It just drops off the side of a cliff and disappears quickly. I&#039;ve also found MDMA to be a bit the same. I never have a strong urge to redose on MDMA. But the high diminsihes in waves. You feel 10 / 10, then suddenly you feel 7 / 10, then 20 minutes later 5 / 10, etc. That&#039;s just what I&#039;ve found anyway. Must have something to do with serotonin, because dopamine-releasing drugs are more addictive and the highs wear off more slowly.
