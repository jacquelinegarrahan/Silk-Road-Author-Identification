				Uggggh! there is a substance that mimics a benzo.. You can buy it at health food stores. I cannot remember the name to save my life. Its a Gabba agonist (just like a little booze will help when you are in benzo withdrawl) Ill look for it....

				You are thinking of GHB, which they don&#039;t sell anymore. Or Valerian root extract. They both interact with GABA

				itll probably be valerian root extract youre thinking of for the downer effect, or valerian/5-htp combo pills although i didnt find they did a lot for me at all. and as for the adderall ive never tried pharma amphetamines (lots of high quality street speed though) but from my readings id suggest modafinil for alertness and concentration, ive heard literally nothing but good things, ill be getting some myself soon so hopefully will be able to report back, i just have to wait for these god awful ssris to clear my system, 5 days was enough to know i really dont want to take them anymore

				thank you for your replies, it seems there are no free meals and messing with GABAs have a price! it&#039;s amazing how widespread the benzos are, and they affect daily life so greatly.<br /><br />anyone has a lot of experience with amphetamines?<br /><br />die SSRIs, die!

Are you taking benzos for anxiety or&nbsp; just to get high..err low in this case :P?<br /><br />Mixing uppers and downers is hard on your body. I would say Adderall is relatively &quot;safe&quot; for a stim but like anything it depends how hard you abuse it.

				Valence is right.&nbsp; Kava can be very heavily sedating.&nbsp; Wayyyy more so than valerian root.

				Adderall is pretty safe. I have friends who&#039;ve been on it for years without problems up to 60mg/day.<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s can be really hard to quit if you&#039;ve been taking them for a while. Barbiturates will help you sleep but they are hard to get these days and are addicting like benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />Most stimulants cause rapid tolerance for some reason, while the tolerance for depressants develops slower. The withdrawal from downer&#039;s is much more dangerous than stimulants.

				Adderal is a MUST for me. Metilphenidate and MDPV are the only &quot;uppers&quot; that make my heart hurts. <br /><br />No problem with Adderal, XR 30 mg (+/- like 15 mg IR)
