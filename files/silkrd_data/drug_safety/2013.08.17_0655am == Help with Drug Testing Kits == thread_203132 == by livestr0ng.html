				I&#039;m interested in buying a test kit for some LSD I just bought. I worry that if I buy one from SR, it could be tampered with. I assume it&#039;d still be sealed but maybe there&#039;s a way for the vendor to get around this. Am I being paranoid? <br /><br />There&#039;s obviously going to be a mark-up if I bought from SR. Would it be sketchy to buy it off cleanet? If not, what source do you personally suggest/have an opinion on? <br /><br />Also, what is the shelf life on these items? If I&#039;m buying test kits, I might as well buy one for MDMA because I&#039;ll probably end up with some sooner or later. Maybe coke too. This is, of course, unless they have a short shelf life. <br /><br />Any other miscellaneous yet relevant information is completely welcome- from personal experience buying them to testing a product that wasn&#039;t what you thought it was to watching a piece of shit asshole cop test your amazing ecstasy right in front of you and try to scare you because it tested positive for meth (...he was a douche).

				You can get them on Amazon. Search for NIK test. Nothing shady or even remotely illegal about it.<br />Shelf life is close to forever. It is chemicals in sealed containers.<br /><br />If anyone asks say you are paranoid that people may drug your drinks when you&#039;re going out and want to be able to test for it or some such, but noone will ask unless you live somewhere where your packages may get opened by others.<br /><br />
