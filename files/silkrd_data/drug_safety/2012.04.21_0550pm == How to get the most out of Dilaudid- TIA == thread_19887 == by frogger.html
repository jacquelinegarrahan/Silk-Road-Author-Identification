				I&#039;ve read a lot before hand, and don&#039;t want to this post to read like I&#039;m an asshole, but I&#039;ve Insufflated different stuff and had good luck.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realize until ~after~ I placed an order on SR for Dilaudid, that it&#039;s best used in IV/shoot form.&nbsp; (I had always heard/read about cancer patients getting it, and thought it would be better than Oxy or Roxi for my weekend warrior use.)<br /><br />I got the order, and tried (2) 4Mg Dilaudids via crushing and snorting, and wasn&#039;t that impressed (Just like this forum wrote)....<br /><br />What is the best way to get my bang for the buck for these?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never skin popped or IV&#039;d but am willing to try with good instructions.<br /><br />Sorry to sound like a douche, but this is new to me, and I&#039;d appreciate any insight as how not to waste these.<br /><br />Thanks.

				If you need help scoring rigs, pop into a local pharmacy, Walgreens usually will not do it, and ask for syringes. Tell them they are for your dad who is on an insulin pump (that is malfunctioning) and that he takes 70 units of &quot;Lantis,&quot; this gets you a 1ml rig. If they offer you a choice in needle size, ask for 1/2 inch, 30 ga. <br /><br />Come home, crush, add water, heat a bit. Rip the cotton off of a q-tip and roll tightly into a ball after washing your hands very well.<br /><br />Pull through the ball, using it as a wik. keeping the end of the needle at all times above the &quot;soup&quot; - it is my theory this cuts down on particulate accumulation, but idk.<br /><br />Tie something around your arm, and aim towards a fat vein.<br /><br />You just got to go at it then, its really common sense. It helps a little to grab the rig by the plunger, and twist your way into the vein. May or may not be worse for your vein, but it is an easy way to get in.<br /><br />When you think you are in, draw back, and if you see blood, push in. If you feel no sting, draw back again, if you see more blood, go at it, you&#039;re good.<br /><br />Release tie contemporaneously and sit back and wait for heaven.

				Thanks for the info, Getting the rigs shouldn&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; I live in the boonies, and there are a few &#039;farm supply stores&#039; that sell inoculations for your new pet, and I should be able to get something unused from them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve cooked coke in a spoon, but was unsure about other stuff.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Is there any advantage or disadvantage of using Saline Solution for the mix?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; I would guess that the vein will be better than the &#039;skin popping&#039;?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Are there any real concerns when doing a 4Mg dilaudid for someone who has a middle of the road opiate tolerance?<br /><br />Thanks!

Not sure<br /><br />2. If by skin popping you mean subcutaneous or IM, then yes, go for the vein.<br /><br />3. 4mg will be safe, although you should avoid leaving any lit smoking materials around, or leaving the stove on in case you nod off.

				Try to get a wheel filter if you can.. Ebay has them. They are kind of expensive but worth it.. I havent looked in the market to see if someone is selling them..IF they are, id get one or two.. When you iv a pill there are man particulates that will end up in your lungs. not to mention causing an infection. <br /><br />I agree snorting/eating dillies are worthless, but you need to watch out for the other dangers of shooting pills. Its generally a very bad idea..Even with wheel filtering you are making it better, not elliminating the dangers..<br /><br />Take care and&nbsp; be careful..

				Thanks Chronic, I&#039;m thinking I may just resell these units.&nbsp; I was naive going into the purchase, and the shooting method is nothing I&#039;ve ever done, and would just feel a lot more safe doing things the way I have in the past.<br /><br />If that makes me a pussy, so be it.<br /><br />Thanks for all who replied.
