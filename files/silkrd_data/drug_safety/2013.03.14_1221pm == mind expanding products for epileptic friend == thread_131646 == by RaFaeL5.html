				Hi, <br /><br />I got a question this weekend from an epileptic friend: &quot;what mind-expanding products (so no coke, speed or similar) are safe to be used by people suffering from epileptic seizures&quot;. <br />The person I&#039;m talking about has a medium form of epilepty, but there is the risk of swallowing the tongue/suffocating...&quot;. <br /><br />Any suggestions? <br />I&#039;m looking for serious (and SAFE) answers. <br /><br />If I need to say to this person that there is no safe product to use in this situation, then I prefer to say so!

				There is some resears hinting at cannabis being useful for treatment of epilepsy. It&#039;s a serious disorder that you should be careful around and not fuck with. Mushrooms is generelly regarded as the safest of the psychedelics, and I think the wisest thing would do is to start in real low doses then slowly increasing over months. It would be very interesting to see if he gets less or more seizures after small doses.<br /><br />Think of starting of at 0.25-0.5 g mushrooms or 40-60 µg LSD. moving to 1 g, 1,5 g, 2 g. Stay at 2 g for a couple of trips (or stop at a lower dose) so that he can judge how safe is mind is in these states. As I understand hallucinogens lower the threshold for seizures so this is definitely a do at his own risk thing. I think there could be real benefit between the trips as long as he does not get a seizure during the trips. Keeping at sub-psychedelic dose (0.5-1g) still gives many of the benefits of the medecine, probably without increasing the risk too much.<br /><br />WARNING! I am no doctor! I have read things on other forums strongly discouraging hallucinogens for epileptic people. Tell him to read A LOT if he wants to try. Find trip reports and threads on the subject so that he can judge for himself, and take responsibility for his own decision :)

				For people with a low seizure threshold, basically all stimulants are a no go.&nbsp; Most downers are fine save maybe quaaludes, which are all but impossible to get outside of South Africa (called mandrax).&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s would actually bring down a seizure threshold, and can be used effectively to stop a seizure dead in its tracks.&nbsp; So if you do give them something that could potentially lower their seizure threshold, a small dose of clonazepam or lorazepam (like 1mg clonazapam or 2 of lorazepam) should help. I&#039;ve had few seizures actually, and I&#039;ve also done tons of drugs.&nbsp; Only thing that really caused problems was long term high dose amphetamine (adderall).&nbsp; <br /><br />For psychedelics, I would think that both mushrooms and acid would be fairly safe, and possibly even DMT.&nbsp; I would just avoid any of the phenylethylamines such as the MDxx or the 2Cx as those are known to lower the seizure threshold (though I never had an issue with them).&nbsp;

				I am by no means a doctor or anything even close to that but my understanding is that mushrooms are safe with seizure prone users. I would suggest allergy testing ANYTHING you give the guy since he sounds inexperienced in general.
