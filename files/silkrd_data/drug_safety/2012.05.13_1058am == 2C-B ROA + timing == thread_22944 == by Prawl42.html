				hey guys so took 2C-B again last night with a friend it was her first time, i took mine mixed in with some water and she just tool the cap.<br /><br />I was feeling effects within 30mins and she didnt really feel much 2 hours after taking.<br /><br />5-6 hours after taking it my effects started to diminish, we chalked hers up to being some natural tolerance? (no idea)<br /><br />but 1-2 hours after i left she called me saying she was tripping pretty hard.<br /><br />my question is that is this possible? she reported mild effects during my trip but we both dropped at the same time and by the time she was feelling the full effects i was pretty much back to baseline.

				Could be a few things:<br /><br />contents of your friends stomach at the time, ie when did she eat last? Heavy/light meal?<br />how well does she normally digest anything, food, other drugs, etc?<br />her own &quot;Set&quot;? Perhaps her subconcious was able to to push the effects back for some time.

				Yeah i thought about food/digestion but even if she ate a huge meal i doubt it would delay it by 6 hours, i thinks she has normal digestion, she hasnt really used psychedelics before mdma a couple of times and coke a fair bit.

				This happened to me my first time on 2C-B. Myself and 2 others dosed 20mg on a FULL stomach. Nothing happened at all for 3.5 hours, so we dosed 15mg more. Needless to say, both doses kicked in at about the same time and we tripped really hard. Stomach contents play a huge role, if you take it already dissolved, it will kick in way faster than a gelcap.
