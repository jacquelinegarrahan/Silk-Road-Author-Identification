				Now I don&#039;t know for sure that these dead dolphins ordered from SR but with some people concerned about kids buying drugs on SR I thought it would probably be a good idea to just not sell drugs to dolphins at all too.&nbsp; Especially not the opiates because it really fucks with their breathing and dolphins really need to breathe spending all that time underwater.&nbsp; &nbsp; Don&#039;t believe me.....read this.<br /><br />http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/05/08/dolphins-die-of-drug-overdose-in-switzerland/?iid=nf-article-mostpop1

				I should have known this was going to happen. I caught those dolphins smoking pot about a year ago, it was only a matter of time before they moved on to heroin. It was so obvious damn it! This is all my fault, why didn&#039;t I stop them?! :&#039;(
