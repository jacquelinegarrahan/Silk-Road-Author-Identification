				I&#039;ve just recently discovered how wonderful shrooms are, and have long had a deep reverence for MDMA. <br />So it&#039;s only natural that now I&#039;m interested in taking them together.<br />Any suggestions?<br />Drop the MDMA first, then eat the shrooms, or the other way around?<br />Discuss.

				Both at the same time is what I usually do or take the molly second. MDMA + trips is always rad. It&#039;s like...bad trip insurance. I always have a great time like that.

				I would do it the other way around, but not by much.&nbsp; I find the peak of mushrooms takes a little longer to arrive than that of MDMA (I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re aiming to have them both peak around the same time).&nbsp; Maybe dose the mushrooms, wait ~30 minutes and dose the MDMA.&nbsp; Have a good time!

				I read that if you take the shrooms first, and then the molly, that you risk the chance of puking up the MDMA.<br />Any personal experience you guys care to share?<br />Plus, I think I&#039;d rather be rolling, and then slowly start tripping.&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve never done it, but am very interested. Would have this past week had an order shown up but no dice. My experience with both substances has been they have similar come up profiles. Rocker&#039;s shrooms that I had this past week hit HARD and FAST. 15 minutes and the world was alright. :D but those were the fastest hitting shrooms I&#039;ve ever had. Usually looking at 30-45 min which is like mdma. I do think rolling and slowly starting to trip would be possibly the best thing ever.<br /><br />Anyway, none of this was of help. Just me rambling and dreaming lol.

				Best method is shrooms first followed my MDMA. The peak and duration of MDMA doesn&#039;t quite match up with shrooms so it&#039;s nice to avoid experiencing a MDMA comedown while still tripping by ensuring that you&#039;ll still be feeling the MDMA towards the comedown of the shrooms.<br /><br />As for things to say about the experience, hippyflipping (as with candyflipping) can sometimes be pretty intense. But as someone else in the thread mentioned, it&#039;s definitely bad trip insurance. You&#039;ll be so loved-up the thought of a bad trip won&#039;t even cross your mind.

				Unless you get the timing down, it might feel like you wasted the two by not doing them separately. If the timing is off, and they lack synergy, then one can overpower the other and they will completely feel like different trips which is no fun. :(

				I might be in the minority here, but I would say don&#039;t do it at all.&nbsp; I&#039;ve candy-flipped and I&#039;ve hippie-flipped, and neither one was all that enjoyable an experience compared to taking any of the substances involved on their own.&nbsp; Rather than getting the best of both worlds, I always seemed to get the worst of both worlds and would end up with a really confusing experience wherein the psychedelics were fighting the MDMA and my brain couldn&#039;t figure out if it was supposed to be tripping or rolling.&nbsp; Just poor timing on the consumption?&nbsp; Could be, I guess - it&#039;s been years since I&#039;ve done either kind of flip, so I don&#039;t really remember the order in which things were consumed - but, yeah... just not a fan of mixing drugs in general.

				Blackbird, I must say I think you&#039;re very much in the minority. Most people adore hippyflipping. Maybe timing, dosage or some other set/setting factors caused problems for you. It really is a beautiful, beautiful thing, both emotionally profound and immensely pleasurable (especially with some n2o in the mix!) Since mushrooms last 5-6 hours and MDMA more like 3-4 hours I like to take mushrooms first and then MDMA about an hour later. If you&#039;re prone to nausea just make sure you do this combo on an empty stomach. I don&#039;t seem to get the shitty comedown feelings from MDMA with this combo either, the gentle comedown from the shrooms seem to smooth everything out towards the end.

Granted, I took MDA instead of MDMA, but it should generally work out best this way, with both peaks coinciding. If you ever do get the chance though, the combination of MDA and mushrooms is possibly one of my personal favorite combinations. A friend&#039;s brother was in town so we decided to show him a good time by hippy flipping. Man....very intense. The body load was a lot to handle, but the visuals and headspace were enough to wash out the body load a bit. My favorite part of the experience was the fact that the &quot;weirdness&quot; of mushrooms that I sometimes feel was washed away and replaced with the phenethylamine feeling. It&#039;s a great combination, have a great time.&nbsp; 8)
