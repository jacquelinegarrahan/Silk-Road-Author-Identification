				So i Receltly required a good amount of MDMA and right when i got it me and all my buddies decided to take a bunch of it. a great thing was i ordered a test kit that came the same day so i know it was MDMA it was rock and powder, anyway at first we weighed out .22 on a scale and parachuted it, within 50 minutes i was rolling balls and smoked and hung out for a few hours but then i took another .2 parachute and within that hour snorted 2 .1 lines at this point i could bearly see straight and was feeling fucking amazing, but i had this like chatter in my jaw and also had&nbsp; crazy shaking in my legs, my other buddy took probably .8 over the night who is more experienced with molly but he was straight fucked. I kinda just wanna know how close was I to like OD ing or how much MDMA can you take max.&nbsp; im 160 510 but yeah i take a lot of drugs 25I took 20 or so times smoke weed a lot daily and shrooms once a month probably dmt if she ever comes around anyway yeah post on my thread homies

				The LD50 for MDMA (the lethal dose for roughly 50% of the population) is over 5grams at once. So you&#039;re not near a lethal dose but doses that high aren&#039;t to good for your brain. If I were you I would not take it for another few months to allow your brain to heal. Make sure to drink a lot of water and to take lots of vitamins and anti oxidants before, during and after. Refer to this thread on MDMA safety, very useful indeed :) http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0

				Yeah I end up binging on it when I do take it (only as a treat every 6 months or so) next time tho I&#039;m only gonna take say max 0.5g with me so I don&#039;t have the option to go crazy on it. Just end up a sweaty shaking mess...... that feels great tho lol

				Love jabber jaw. Not a good look when out though! I&#039;ve seen people start thinking they are at work or somewhere else. I have a friend who always does it. Eyes shut making strange hand movements as if he&#039;s &#039;working&#039; very strange yet amusing to watch. Anyone else seen this? I&#039;m a pill/mdma snob so it&#039;s always quality produce that is ingested.
