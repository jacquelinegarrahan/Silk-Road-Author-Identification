				Title: <strong>MDA Dosage Suggestions</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m pretty well versed when it comes to a variety of substances, MDMA, Coke, Weed, LSD, phens, tryps, but I&#039;ve never had an MDA experience. I&#039;ve done a lot of scrounging around on the clearnet (Erowid, Bluelight, Drugs forum, etc.) and even read Shulgin&#039;s writings about MDA. There also wasn&#039;t much to go by here on the forums as for proper MDA doses. I only use MDMA once every few months, but I still like dropping Dutch pills (180+mg) or my own caps at 180mg+ because of the unbelievable come-up and euphoria even if it floors me for a bit. Any suggestions as to where I should start with MDA since it seems to be slightly stronger and or people are more sensitive to it than MDMA? I&#039;m definitely looking for that floored/faced feeling for part of if not all of my adventure.

				I&#039;d go with 180 mg or maybe up to 200 mg. This may just be me, but I felt that MDA had ONE really really good peak and then came down into this trippy euphoria that lasted for another 4 hours. I also felt like I was more sensitive to MDMA than MDA, personally. Start at 180 and then work your way up :) it&#039;s a beautiful novelty.

				Thanks a lot Zip, I always see you chiming in everywhere with decent feedback. I decided that a 40-50mg bump to get off of baseline might be a good idea and then go ahead and take the 160mg cap I made right after that. If 160 is too little I may bump a wee bit more as I&#039;m peaking or reaching my peak to go ahead and really make my night a blast. Instead of thirsty Thursday tomorrow its going to be trippy Thursday.

				Hell yeah! I hope it goes well for you!<br />Just remember how quickly tolerance builds with MDA. It&#039;s a bitch.

				Just to put it in perspective I normally roll on MDMA with about 200mg and MDA at about 120mg. For me, those two doses get me to about the same level of spun.<br /><br />If you are looking to get floored I would probably start at 120mg and bump from there. The trick is, when you take too much, you&#039;re not really there to enjoy it. My girl and I did a double bump of MDA a while back and we were just fucking floored. For like an hour. Couldn&#039;t talk. Don&#039;t really remember it. Just checked out for a while.<br /><br />For me part of the fun is being aware enough of the experience to actually enjoy it. 180mg of MDA would be pushing it for me in a single dose. Plus, since MDA lasts longer, it&#039;s easier to start small and bump up to a bigger dose to climb to a higher and longer peak.<br /><br />Have fun though, I love the MDA!

				Well I can definitely say I wasn&#039;t ready to take around 190mg of MDA in one night. It was probably one of the most profound psychedelic experiences I have ever had though. Just dropping 150mg would have been perfect to reduce psychedelic blackouts. I started off with a 30mg bump just to get me off of baseline before my 160mg cap kicked in. About an hour or so after dropping my capsule, I thought I had reached my peak and it really felt like an MDMA peak, boy was I wrong. After about fifteen to twenty minutes my eyes started twitching hard. If I lost my focus on the music or lights that were flashing at the party I would close my eyes to try and get my bearings again. Every time my eyes closed I started to see the music come on in my head with changing colors and fractals, open my eyes and everything had an acid like breathing pattern to it. I can honestly say I missed parts of my friend&#039;s set that he was debuting for the first time because if I would close my eyes for too long I literally just took off into psychedelic blackout. From what everyone was saying I seemed completely fine and they didn&#039;t even notice that I had drifted off, and hell it might not have even really happened. Fast forward today the day after, I don&#039;t feel drained of serotonin or drained physically and I never seem to after rolling or tripping, but even after some hardcore OJ drinking, some multi-vitamins, and good sleep my pupils are still dinner plates and I think I might even be tripping a little bit. I&#039;m still seeing tracers and things are randomly catching my eye, sometimes I don&#039;t even think anything is really there, it all just seems so surreal. I definitely had a load of fun and it wasn&#039;t anywhere near comparable to 200+mg of MDMA, which I would say is laughable when compared to the sheer trippiness and strength of MDA. Two million thumbs up to the ILF and I urge anyone not ready to blast-off into hyperspace to keep it around 120-130mg.

				Yeah I was trying to catch you before you jumped onto that ship... it&#039;s a fuck of a ride.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that it&#039;s not fun, it&#039;s just that when you go over the top like that you end up not remembering the freaking trip!<br /><br />The really cool thing with MDA, unlike MDMA, is you can get to the good spot, 120mg - 150mg depending on where you want to be, and bump to keep yourself there a really long time, unlike MDMA where it&#039;s more of a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs of diminishing returns.<br /><br />Most people really just aren&#039;t prepared for how visual MDA is compared to MDMA. It&#039;s a whole different world.<br /><br />So next time, give the lower dose a go and see how it goes. I will tell you that the physical / mental side of the high has a sweet spot at the dose I suggested while the visuals just continue to escalate as you go up from there. It can get pretty damn odd as you keep putting more of that stuff in you. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah Diamond, I really should have taken your advice just for the sheer fact of remembering everything. Slowly bumping my way to where I want to be seems like the smarter idea next time instead of just eating a nice fat cap. The experience was literally so far away from MDMA I can&#039;t even begin to describe it. The reason why I asked for advice here was because of all the Clearnet non-sense, kids not testing pills/powders, reports ranging from full blown visuals to just a speedy MDMA, and all of the other bullshit included in most trip reports. It would be quite interesting to see how a low dose of MDA mixed with LSD or 2C-B would fare, not that I&#039;m one for mixing any substances.

				i like a 50:50 ratio. Last time I did .1 mdma and .1 mda in 1 cap and was floored. The MDA you can definitely feel more than the mdma. Perhaps a 60:40 ratio of mdma to mda is better.

				Even 70:30 MDMA to MDA is a great ratio because MDA really is that strong for a lot of people. Expect to be out of it if you are even taking 100mg of MDMA and 70mg of MDA. I will be testing out a combo soon of 90mg of MDMA to 60mg of MDA and I will definitely let you all know how it goes. I&#039;m going to take a lot of time to recover though because I know MDA is one hell of a drug.
