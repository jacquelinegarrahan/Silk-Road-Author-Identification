				Due to drug test possibilities in our old job (never happened) we used the New Zealand made synth cannabinoid&nbsp; Kronic for two years (which we got in November 2010 and finished around may 2012. We had about 10g and used on average once a week or less.)<br /><br />Anyway, toward the end of using this brand, and we never did figure out which JWH was in it, we used to note how the sense of &#039;relief&#039; would wash over us after a hard days work, there was this nice little rush of &#039;chilledness&#039; is how we describe it.<br /><br />Anyhoo, fast forward to now, we can use the plant matter because the test threat has left our life, and we do! The thing is, we have found two things on returning to the plant... there is no &#039;chill&#039; factor on that first toke no sense of Ahhh... here comes relaxation.... (whoosh!) now :) and ...the munchies&nbsp; are back with the green :(<br /><br />We&#039;re wondering if our synth had any benzodiazepine anxiolytic aka phenazepam in it as far as the below snip from the clearnet Wikipedia claims, perhaps we will never know...<br /><br />&nbsp;Has anyone used both THC and synths for long enough to add their own experiences? Also do you know what you were getting?<br />And finally, since JWH can be smoked/vaped raw, why bulk it up with oregano and whatnot? Since bulking it with plant only makes it harder to ship, carry and use (increased smoke and odor)<br /><br />It seems the marketers want less sophisticated users to make the &quot;Duh! It&#039;s kinda totally like weed hurrr!&quot; connection, and AFAIKT that&#039;s the only (dubious) reason to be mixing the synth with plant matter...<br /><br />Health wise, there&#039;s a lot of talk of psychosis, and the &#039;inventor&#039; of a lot of the synths has called users of them &#039;idiots&#039;. (see the Wikipedia article for this in full.) but then again, &#039;the risks&#039; are almost always overblown, and even when they&#039;re not, folks will always just go ahead and do shit anyway... we don&#039;t think we&#039;re any worse off for using the synth stuff, we&#039;re a bit foggy headed for a day after, but thats like dope too...<br /><br />A lot covered in this thread, pick your favorite bit and weigh in!<br /><br />OK so here is the Wikipedia chunk...<br /><br />&nbsp;Synthetic cannabis is claimed by the manufacturers to contain a mixture of traditionally used medicinal herbs, each of which producing mild effects, with the overall blend resulting in the cannabis-like intoxication produced by the product. Herbs listed on the packaging of Spice include Canavalia maritima, Nymphaea caerulea, Scutellaria nana, Pedicularis densiflora, Leonotis leonurus, Zornia latifolia, Nelumbo nucifera, and Leonurus sibiricus. However, when the product was analyzed by laboratories in Germany and elsewhere, it was found that many of the characteristic &quot;fingerprint&quot; molecules expected to be present from the claimed plant ingredients were not present. There were also large amounts of synthetic tocopherol present. This suggested that the actual ingredients might not be the same as those listed on the packet, and a German government risk assessment of the product conducted in November 2008 concluded that it was unclear as to what the actual plant ingredients were, where the synthetic tocopherol had come from, and whether the subjective cannabis-like effects were actually produced by any of the claimed plant ingredients or instead caused by a synthetic cannabinoid drug.<br />Synthetic cannabinoid ingredients<br />In January 2009, researchers at the University of Freiburg in Germany announced that an active substance in Spice was an undisclosed analogue of the synthetic cannabinoid CP 47,497.[14] Later that month, CP 47,497 along with its dimethylhexyl, dimethyloctyl and dimethylnonyl homologues, were added to the German controlled drug schedules.[15][16] In May the analogue of CP 47,497 was named cannabicyclohexanol.[17]<br />In July 2010, it was announced that JWH-018 is one of the active components in at least three versions of Spice, which had been sold in a number of countries around the world since 2002, often marketed as incense.[18][19][20][21] Another potent synthetic cannabinoid, HU-210, has been reported to have been found in Spice seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.[22] An analysis of samples acquired four weeks after the German prohibition of JWH-018 took place found that the compound had been replaced with JWH-073.[23]<br />Different ratios of JWH-018 and CP 47,497 and their analogues have been found in different brands of synthetic cannabis[24] and manufacturers constantly change the composition of their products.[25] The amount of JWH-018 in Spice has been found to vary from 0.2% to 3%.[26]<br />An analysis of 41 different synthetic cannabis blends sold commercially in New Zealand, conducted by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research and released in July 2011, found 11 different synthetic cannabinoid ingredients used: including JWH-018, JWH-073, AM-694, AM-2201, RCS-4, RCS-4 butyl homologue, JWH-210, JWH-081, JWH-250 (or possibly JWH-302, isomer not determined), JWH-203, and JWH-122â€”with between one and five different active ingredients, though JWH-018 was present in 37 of the 41 blends tested. In two brands the benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug phenazepam was also found, which is classified as a prescription medicine in New Zealand, and so these brands were ordered to be removed from the market by emergency recall.

				I smoked a synthetic blend daily that I bought local head shop. It gave me a crazy high but very often soon after smoking I would get these terrible feelings of guilt. I felt like I&nbsp; was hurting my mind by using the stuff. I&#039;ve experienced paranoia from strong mj before, but this was different. Just unnatural and dirty but for some reason I really liked it. One I was smoking right as my girlfriend and I started making&nbsp; dinner and I became so confused like I&#039;ve been before. On top of that there were a few instances of me having a sort of disoriented fugue state when I hadn&#039;t even been smoking. I would have no short term memory what so ever for most of a day and do incredibly senseless tasks. Very scary. Not touching a blend or a synthetic again. I still feel like my marijuana tolerance has been absolutely destroyed by blends, and its been about 6 months since stopping daily 6 month use.&nbsp;

				I would recommend am-2201 to experienced users. That being said only because of the very fine measurements required to keep it a pleasant experience.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp;

				Well, I tried a few different kinds and will never touch the stuff again. It can give you a kind of similar high, which I enjoyed to a point as I was clean for a long time. It was just nice to be in a different state of mind. But man it was so easy to smoke too much. Like, 1 too many hits and I&#039;m fucked better go lay down till this wears off kinda thing. Also it just felt dirty in my brain, I&#039;m not sure how to explain this but I just felt like it was a bad bad thing. I know there are a bunch of different kinds all with little differences but the ones I tried were enough that I am damn sure I will never touch the stuff again.

				I smoked 3.5g&#039;s of synthetic weed a day for a few months.<br />WORST DRUG EVER.<br />I got hellish withdrawals when I stopped. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat or function properly. I would sweat like a pig all day and all night.<br />I had an addiction to opiates and I got worse withdrawals from the synthetic cannabinoids.<br /><br />My advice is to smoke the plant.... and if you can&#039;t get the plant... then stay sober.<br />I learned that lesson the hard way.

				I hate the K2ish type of synthetics. I did try those and never liked them. But, as I said before, with the correct judgment and willpower to not smoke all damn day long, am-2201. I use it as a.... &quot;special&quot; cigarette when on break. Sprinkling 2-3 mg in a cig will give me about 1-2 hours of a buzz that is nearly identical to some mid grade bud. I do not get any urge to re-dose and nothing but feeling tired comes as an after-effect. But, as we all know these things differ from person to person.&nbsp; 8)
