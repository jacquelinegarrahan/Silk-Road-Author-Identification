				I have Rolling for a long time,But as most Americans know U.S. MDMA or Pills have not been good. Recently started ordering Dutch Rolls... Just curious what do the Dutch know that the rest of the world doesn&#039;t? The Rolls I get from Amsterdam are better than anything I have bought in America for at least 6 years probably more.

				My theory would be the rave/techno/electronic music scene in Europe in general is more popular than in the US. I remember 10-15 years ago it was big in the US and ecstasy was easier to obtain and far more pure than it is in my area today. I feel like that music scene is back on the rise again and with it demand for club drugs, so hopefully the supply becomes better as well.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve been &#039;hooked up&#039; with some douche in a club that claims to have ecstasy in the past 5 years and he whips out a baggie of capsules and I tell him to fuck off. If they aren&#039;t pressed I don&#039;t even bother, as 90% of the MDMA in my area is cut and usually very poorly cut.<br /><br />The exception to this would be Miami, South Beach to be specific. There are a shit ton of bunk ass drugs and undercover LE on the streets, but if you find the right hookups there is plenty of legit everything available. Word of advice if you are in South Beach, stay away from anyone offering you anything on Washington Ave, I can spot an undercover LE every couple blocks there, and they quite regularly try to offer drugs to people standing in line to get into clubs like The Mansion as well, if that&#039;s even still around - been a few years for me.

				I think because a lot of the &#039;ingredients&#039; come by ship through the harbor of Rotterdam. By the time the stuff reaches Germany of Poland f.e. it has been touched by many hands and probably cut a few times too, so we are close to the &#039;source&#039; of the products and that&#039;s why Dutch stuff is the best :P<br /><br />These are one of the things that make me a proud Dutchie hehe 8)

				It isn&#039;t, necessarily the best. There&#039;s just higher quantities of quality product, and more forgiving drug laws, and thus, it may be even more culturally acceptable than other places, causing high demand.&nbsp; The high demand would be in no small part due the electronic scene in Europe.&nbsp; I think you can find just as high quality pure molly in England etc, just far less of it to go around maybe.&nbsp;

				I just finished reading an article online and basically what it said was that the precursor chemicals to manufacture MDMA are very heavily regulated by the DEA in the U.S. thus the reason for such small supply. Any truth to this?

				A combination of the test centres and the differing cultures I guess. In Europe there&#039;s a strong rave culture, which isn&#039;t as prominent in the US as I understand it. Add to that the fact pill pressers in the US know that they can fill their pills full of shit and still flog them, and you end up with the situation you&#039;ve got in the US.<br /><br />When I go to either a free party or a club night (always gotta be jump up dnb ;-) ) in the UK it&#039;s full of people chewing their faces off. People know their md, and if it wasn&#039;t that, they&#039;d complain.<br /><br />I will say something though, since the MD drought we had in the UK (2008-10), all the stuff since, whether it&#039;s Dutch or English just hasn&#039;t hit the spot the same. It&#039;s good, don&#039;t get me wrong, but I NEVER get loved up the same as I used to. If anybody can put me onto a vendor selling MD that gets them totally loved up (hugging strangers, having those deep convo&#039;s about how your mate&#039;s the most important person etc) I&#039;d be much appreciated!

				&quot;Why Dutch MDMA is the best&quot;<br />It is because of the Dutch drug laws. The penalties for drug manufacture and possession are lower in Netherlands than in the rest of Europe and many other countries. <br />Netherlands is located geographically in a place where the product is easy to distribute all over the world. The people there also know what they are doing. <br /><br />Sassafras oil is actually nowadays produced in big quantities in Asia but as Asia carries such evil laws for even possessing small amounts of drugs (death penalty/life in jail) the drugs themselves ain&#039;t produced there. Also, the MDMA market ain&#039;t that huge in Asia as it is in Europe and North America.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s easier to get away with it that&#039;s why, I used to know a chemist out here in the states and he would manufacture MDMA but he had his operation on complete lockdown. He only had two distributors and no one else could touch his stuff, I feel like that&#039;s problem with the domestic scene. On top of that people want to make more money so it&#039;s easier to sell pills cut with caffeine/speed/meth etc.

				The ecstasy from the netherlands is amazing.<br /><br />Nothing on the streets of America can even compare... some of the amazing pills I&#039;ve taken here (white music notes, green feet, etc...) can be amazing rolls however they can not compete ( in regards to mdma quantity, quality, press, style, etc...) to anything I&#039;ve taken from the Netherlands.
