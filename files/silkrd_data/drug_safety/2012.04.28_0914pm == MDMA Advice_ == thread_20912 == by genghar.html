For the most part, if you do nothing else but MDMA then it shouldn&#039;t last longer than 2 hours, after the 2 hour mark you will come down nicely and driving is no problem.

				I would have to recommend Ivory&#039;s mdma. I took 150 mg of it last night and it was freakin awesome. 45 minutes in advance should be good. Maybe an hour, it kinda depends. I dont recommend driving while on any drugs mainly because of the cops, but if you need to you can function just fine on the stuff. Driving would not really be a problem if you don&#039;t do any other drugs or alcohol. But, like he said, after a couple of hours you will be coming down and all will be dandy. Anyways even at the peak, it doesn&#039;t really impair driving or functions, just makes you feel like jesus. Well good luck have fun and be safe!&nbsp; :)

Also yes the two hours is pretty much your peak and after that is just your comedown which is still awesome. Some more advice would be to drink plenty of water but don&#039;t overdo it. Just hold onto a water bottle and take a drink whenever your mouth feels dry. Taking multivitamins the days before/during/after is always recommended. Also I&#039;m not a fan of cigarettes but when I&#039;m on some good MDMA a menthol cigarette is amazing. The best advice I can give you is to take it and not worry about, just pretend like you didn&#039;t even take it and just roll with it and you&#039;ll have a blast&nbsp; ;)

Magnesium helps with the jaw clenching but most likely your vitamins already contain magnesium so just check the back to see if it already has it if not then you can go to a pharmacy and pick some up. 5-htp is normally only used when you get the mdma blues but for the most part you won&#039;t get any, only in high doses have I seen people get depressed because of the serotonin depletion so I think you&#039;ll be fine without it.

				Drink 3 liters of OJ and take 10-20 Vit C tabs. Nicely preloads. 5-HTP preloads you too. <br /><br />Also if I were me and the last time I checked I was, I would just go for the full 150mg. How big are you as well, your height and weight can be a dosage factor. I am quite a big guy so I always do about 180-250mg.

				Ah that&#039;s a shitter man, I&#039;m sorry to hear that is the case. <br /><br />If that is the case man, I might even recommend not doing it at all until you are with friends. The MDxxs are all highly social and empathetic drugs and they really are all best shared with your nearest and dearest the first time round. I know when I did MDMA the first time round I was so glad I was doing it with my mates. Made the experience because of the empathy and bonding you do on it. Same with MDA, MBDB, MDEA as well. They are all things I would want to do with friends the first time round. <br /><br />Not trying to be a kill joy here btw. Just an observation.

				Its really not a problem if your friends aren&#039;t there. The beauty of the drug is that it makes it so easy for you to befriend everyone around you. Being with a close friend or lover is fantastic but a completely different experience. Bottom line is that if you take mdma, your gonna have an awesome time.

For me personally though MDMA is best with friends the FIRST time round. I would want to share that with someone who meant something to me.<br /><br />Also I am a bit of a club monkey but I always think it&#039;s best to go, drop and then your group can mingle with others. <br /><br />Whatever you end up doing OP.
