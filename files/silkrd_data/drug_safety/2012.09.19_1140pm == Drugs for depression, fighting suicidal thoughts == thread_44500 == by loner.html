				At the age of 20&nbsp; i started with ALCOHOL to treat depression but it only made my depression worse. i&#039;ve attempted suicide before and i am now 25 and on the verge of suicide again. <br /><br />i&#039;ve tried ADDERALL for depression. it worked at first but now i get even more depressed afterwards.<br /><br />i tried MDMA to treat my depression but it stopped working eventually and made things worse as well<br /><br />marijuana does not work. it even makes it worse because i hear voices when i&#039;m on it, get paranoid, etc. The voices say things like &quot;you&#039;ll never do it&quot;, &quot;it&quot; being suicide. It&#039;s like they&#039;re egging me on. I hear voices sometimes without marijuana, but marijuana makes it worse<br /><br />i need something to STOP the paranoia, STOP the anxiety, STOP the depression before i end up killing myself<br /><br />i am curious about heroin. <br /><br />i exercise, lift weights, eat healthy, take supplements, nothing works. drugs are my final attempt before i give up.

				I&#039;d suggest going to a GP with it and explaining what you did in the past. Serious depression isn&#039;t easily treated by any drug, illicit or legal.&nbsp; <br /><br />A GP would probably prescribe you a combination or SSRI&#039;s and therapy, which may be a good thing in your situation. I&#039;m not inclined to suggest therapy for relatively minor problems, but by the time you are seriously considering suicide, i think it should be an option. It&#039;s extremely important that you do these things at the same time though, and not start on SSRI&#039;s before a therapist is available, since these drugs can sometimes make tendencies worse before doing you any good.<br /><br />It will not be a pleasant process, but sometimes you need to go through it to keep yourself out of harms way. Go have a talk with a GP with experience in such problems and see what options he suggests. You can always decline if you think its not for you, but at least you will get some good information on available treatments. <br /><br />Also, do not be embarrassed about the substances you used and actions you took - a good physician with experience in this field will know they are not that strange and not judge you for trying. Treatment is not about criticizing your past, but about how to proceed from where you are right now. <br /><br /><br /><br />

Keep the fuck off the dope/hash. This drug directs the conscious mind in an area where you are unlikely to find the sustenance that you need.<br /><br />Heroin, I have never tried, but seriously!?!?!<br /><br />Technically speaking, your suicidal depression is simply a result of malignant psychological &#039;programming&#039; which can be changed. Naturally, the malignant code exists within your unconscious mind. What is therefore required is a method to take you into that place with the ability to shine a whole lot more light in there than you otherwise would. <br /><br />How I &#039;cured&#039; myself was through using LSD. <br /><br />But be advised, you will have your own inner demons to confront and/or deal with and this could well be a painful process which will require an inner strength and knowing on your part to overcome. However, living requires courage. Spiritual/mental courage or otherwise.<br /><br />Also...if you start trying hallucinogens, stick to low doses at least until you gain enough confidence in yourself and with the substance.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Loner - You&#039;ve had plenty of great advice on here already, but I would like to contribute :)<br /><br />First of all NEVER GIVE UP - Life is full of ups, and downs, but nonetheless needs to be enjoyed and treasured. You never know what is gone until it&#039;s gone. Life needs to be lived!<br /><br />Excising, taking multi vitamins, eating healthy, are all positive keep those things up! However, are you sure your taking the RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS, like St. John&#039;s Wart, Omega 3, 5 HTP, Sam-e, and Folic Acid, in the correct quantities? You can be taking all the supplements in the world, but if your not administering them correctly, it won&#039;t count for much, if nothing at all! If your unsure, investing in a good herbalist, can do wonders!<br /><br />You need to address what has gone wrong, and where, once you establish this, you&#039;ll feel a lot better, that would be half the war won, you would have found your problem, only once you find your problem your healing process and cure can commence.<br /><br />Hypnotherapy can be good, counseling can be good, a friend to talk to can even have a positive impact. Do one thing every day to make you happy, all the small steps will add up to a big one in your world of getting better!<br /><br />Right, now for my drugs advice. Mescaline (peyote cactus) has been used for thousands of years by Native American&#039;s to help treat depression, I have heard some very positive feedback on it, I&#039;m sure it has it&#039;s downfalls, but like anything treat it well and do not abuse it. Most importantly if you decided to take any psychedelics for the first time, always ensure your trusted sitter is by your side. In terms of weed stick to Savitas instead of Indicas. You should find them more motivating Durban Poison, Silver Haze, and Sweet Island, are my suggestions!<br /><br />Please, remember above, all these things, find the root cause of your problems. As one wise poster said here, everything is connected to everything, you need to find your beginning to get to the end of this. It&#039;s the true way forward.<br /><br />Good luck to you. My thoughts are with you. I wish you better :)

				This may or may not be really shitty advice but it&#039;s good for a temp fix. <br /><br />Opiates. Try some opiates.<br /><br />Have at some hydrcodone, oxycodone, or hell even heroin. That&#039;s sum happiness right there :)

				That&#039;s a good way to satisfy your self-mutilation and kill yourself, too. I&#039;ve seen so many of my friends who were once intelligent, happy-go-lucky high school kids turn into hollow shells who steal from their friends and can&#039;t think about anything else but how much money they can get for H. It doesn&#039;t happen for everyone, but damn, it happened to a lot of my friends.<br /><br />Drugs are for people for whom reality is not enough. They have mastered themselves or are looking for more. When you go into a psychedelic experience, or try stimulants or opiates, and you are not a fully developed and whole person, you run a serious risk of having your mind torn up in the process. These are powerfully altering substances who&#039;s very existence can permanently change who you are. They will be either creative or destructive experiences depending on the underlying tone of your mind.<br /><br />You have to know who you are, what you&#039;re doing here as a living human (having a direction to your will), and see that you are progressing according to that direction. Only after those things are strong would I ever recommend someone take any drug (including alcohol).

				You&#039;re in a desperate frame of mind right now, depressed and suicidal. If I were you, I&#039;d stay the fuck away from opiates, or anything with strong addiction potential. Trying to self-medicate with potentially harmful/highly addictive drugs isn&#039;t the way to go when you&#039;re in that place, it can often lead to a downward spiral. I&#039;m not saying &quot;drugs are bad&quot;, because I&#039;m sure for some people those/similar drugs may help them to self-medicate, but it&#039;s all about being in the right frame of mind, get yourself well and then experiment to your heart&#039;s content and find what&#039;s right for you. But looking at drugs for an &quot;easy way out&quot; is the wrong way to use them. Plus, if you&#039;re suicidal, who knows how you&#039;ll feel under the influence of those drugs? What if you feel so happy and content that you accidentally OD just because you&#039;re so desperate not to lose that feeling?<br /><br />Potential options:<br />- Find a GP who understands. This can be a horrific, upsetting, distressing process, from my own experience. But take some time and really try. Be blunt and outright about your drug use and suicidal thoughts, ask for a referral to a trained psychologist/psychiatrist.<br />- Go directly to a mental health clinic, tell them you are suicidal and you need help. They&#039;re likely to be far more understanding than a GP and will get you the help you need a damn sight faster.<br />- Depending on your country, self-admittance into a mental health facility where you can sign out and leave at any time. But, if you choose to stay, they will provide you with the therapy and treatment you require, allowing you to escape your day-to-day life and focus on getting well.

				Meditation as far as i&#039;m concerned is the only way you will beat this. Join a class. It will take time, but my god it will help you. If you really feel like drugs are the answer then i guess it is possible that a DMT brew like Ayahuasca could help you. I cant speak from first hand experience because i have never taken Ayahuasca, but i am very aware of its effects and reasons to use it.<br /><br />I hope that helps.<br /><br />I wish you all the best my friend.

				You know what your problem is? You&#039;re looking for the easy way out. I mean, why even think about suicide in the first place. That&#039;s such an easy cop out. Let me level with you. The road is not easy, the drugs are not helping, and the fact that you keep telling yourself nothing is working even though you are doing everything right is bullshit. You want a true anti-depressant? Enroll in a marathon. Climb a mountain. Then tell no one. Cogito ergo sum means I think, therefore I am. You truly are depressed and allowing yourself to be sad. It hurts less to put on a fake smile and tell people you are happy than it does to tell people about all of your fucking problems, because let&#039;s be honest; do you have reoccurring nightmares or daydreams of dead, headless children? Do you catch a faint smell of burning flesh whenever you hear laughter? I would hope so with your antics.<br /><br />Story time... When I was in basic training (eons ago) we had this kid who kept &quot;attempting&quot; suicide. He strung himself up with bootlaces once..didn&#039;t work. He swallowed a bottle of ibuprofen once..didn&#039;t work. He tried cutting his wrists with a shaving razor..guess what. It didn&#039;t work. Finally, our Drill Instructor, after realizing that this little prick just wasn&#039;t getting the attention he was used to, told him to jump out of the 3rd story window head first. Made him realize that no one gave a shit about his problems. Everyone knew he wasn&#039;t allowing himself to help himself because he finally made it. He finally took the plunge...

				I am surprised no one on these forums have mentioned any of the follow things I will.<br /><br />My advice is that you should probably not try to go towards finding a drug. Your programming your subconscious mind and pretty convincing yourself that no matter what you will not cure yourself without any kind of drug. This is not good and will only add more to work on to recover. I would try meditating as this can help if done right. Pick up a few books on Buddhism or Taoism anything that may catch your eyes. A small yet good introductory book is &quot;Peace is Every Step&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh. There are different kind of supplements that you can take other then what you may be taking. (You make it seem like you are taking workout supplements as you didn&#039;t list them)<br /><br />Try taking and or looking into any of the following:<br /><br />Passion Flower Extract<br />GABA<br />Kava Kava<br />Valerian Root Extract<br />St. Johns Wort<br /><br />From my personal experience I have used GABA, St. Johns Wort, and Passion Flower extract and in that order.<br />People have reported that GABA may not even be useful as it takes so much to force some past the blood brain barrier due to you taking it sublingually. I found that St. Johns Wort worked pretty well at alleviating stress and anxiety I stopped taking it myself as I learned it is an MAOI and those are not good to mix with MDMA. I have recently bought a fl oz of Passion Flower Extract and I have found that it does help with anxiety pretty damn well. I don&#039;t seem to get anxiety attacks like I had in the past (not regular attacks just out of the blue) you take that two to three times a day with a glass of water.<br /><br />I hope anything that I posted comes to help you and if you want to ask questions go for it. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t/don&#039;t feel as you do but I believe that what I listed can help you. If you want recommendations for other books let me know I have quite a few.

				As a long-term depression/anxiety sufferer, I know how tempting it is to treat your condition with this or that drug.&nbsp; Not that you shouldn&#039;t use drugs as part of your treatment regimen, but no single drug is ever going to &quot;cure&quot; your depression...especially if you abuse it.&nbsp; It takes constant work and vigilance to maintain good mental health.&nbsp; That may include counseling/therapy, nutritional interventions and alternative medicine, spiritual pursuits, self-education or other treatments.&nbsp; <br /><br />Depression is a really broad term for a condition that comes in many forms (atypical, major, bi-polar, cyclothymia, etc) and can have many causes.&nbsp; Life events and past trauma are major contributors, but biological issues like hypothyroidism and other medical conditions can also cause depressed mood.&nbsp; The trick is in finding out which type of depression you have and what the root causes are.&nbsp; This involves a lot of reading but is worth it if you want to get better.&nbsp;

				I suppose it depends on how you look at things. Humanity managed to survive and evolve for millenia without medication and without therapy, so it should be fairly clear that most people could live out their lives without either. <br /><br />That said, i&#039;d probably advocate the medication-first approach in general. It&#039;s fast, cheap, and often effective. In cases where proofs not to be effective therapy is probably the best option, possibly combined with medication. Depression that lasts for years despite trying to take medication for it would certainly warrant a further look by a specialist. Mild to moderate depression is often a transient condition that would actually pass without intervention, but would be uncomfortable for the period it lasts (weeks, months). Severe, long term depression is usually another beast that would benefit by finding the root cause rather then just fixing the symptoms - particularly if the latter doesn&#039;t work that well. <br /><br />

				I think the OP should also know that there are safe drugs for treating depression, namely anti-depressants. They do work, and while it won&#039;t make the highs from any drug good, it definitely is the correct drug to be taking than otherwise addictive drugs.<br /><br />See a doctor, get anti-depressants.

				^ how did this go from depression to the wonders of crazy sex with bi-polar chicks? Love it, might have to have to add that to the old bucket list... the last super hot bi-polar chick i knew just moved away, damn.<br /><br />As for the depression, drugs don&#039;t help depression man. MDMA and ket are probably great for things like PTSD but no drugs, even anti-depression meds are that great for when at a suicidal stage. Antidepresents just make you sleepy so you can&#039;t be fucked doing anything silly like taking your own life, then bamm, you miss a dose, have a shitty day and all this energy and its all over. True story.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure the only proven cure is movement, get your body moving, heart rate pumping, push yourself to your physical limits - your physiological brain stuff will do the rest to make your feel great.

				I can somewhat relate with the OP. When I was in high school, I was depressed as well. I felt like I had no one to talk to, no one to trust. In 9th or 10th grade, I think my shoes were untied that day, and one of my teachers let me know that my shoes were untied, and I&#039;m paraphrasing when I said to him, &quot;if I get hurt/die, it wouldn&#039;t matter.&quot; One thing led to another, and I ended up seeing a shrink. One day, another thing led to another, and my shrink got &quot;scared&quot; of what I was saying, called the police, and I ended up in a state hospital. My mom, who was with me, pleaded with the doctor to let me go. I was then scheduled to see a psychiatrist more often and got prescribed anti-depressants which didn&#039;t work all that well.<br /><br />One day, I was with my friend, and we went over his friend&#039;s house, and that is when I got high on marijuana for the first time. We were watching Scarface, but I couldn&#039;t stop laughing through out of the movie. I think from that day on, I was finally coming out of the darkness, and started getting in control of my life. When I reflect on my past, I think I was on auto pilot with no real ambitions or goals in life.&nbsp; Fast forward to several years later, I graduated from college, and trying to start the rest of my life. I think if I never smoked marijuana, I probably would of committed suicide or at least attempt the selfish, desperate act.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that I&#039;m &quot;cured&quot; now. I&#039;m far from being depressed, but I still deal with some anxiety and mild self-loathing issues from time to time. My biggest issue facing me today is still my overall lack of confidence, which has affected me greatly when it comes to women, for instance. I&#039;m embarrassed that I&#039;m in my mid 20&#039;s, never been in a &quot;real&quot; relationship, and only had sex with two girls. Yeah, I&#039;m a loser, I guess?&nbsp; The sex wasn&#039;t great, pretty mediocre to just bad, with either girl. I felt like I was lucky when I hooked up with them instead of me going after them. A part of me wants to give up on women all together, but I don&#039;t know. I tried to &quot;man up,&quot; but doing that is so hard for me to do. I&#039;m under this unshakeable assumption that no women like me. I guess I&#039;m so afraid of rejection that I don&#039;t even bother doing it. Yes, I do workout. In fact, I&#039;m in the best shape of my life, but I digress. Would it be a good idea to see a psychiatrist again? I don&#039;t have any metal health insurance.<br /><br />Overall, I agree with the aforementioned comments of drugs not being the ultimate answer to solving mental health issues, but they can help. Masking problems with drugs will only prolong one&#039;s issue(s) with the potential of exacerbating them.

				Go skydiving and base jumping, you will become addicted to it. Also Apnea diving with whales is much recommended. You can use respiration tanks too, but I like it much with none.

What works for me may not work for you and vice versa. Advocating anti-depression medicine, for instance, can just be as bad as they&#039;re known increase depression (see below) and/or increase suicidal thoughts. Anyway, you&#039;re right to a degree, but it ultimately comes down to the individual. I&#039;ve seen reports that support both arguments. I was treated with anti-depression medicine--Paxil to be exact. Paxil barely worked for me, and sometimes made me feel worse. Now, I&#039;m at the point of my life that I don&#039;t need to smoke marijuana anymore, but I choose to do it from time to time. Hey, I might as well have one vice in my life since I barely drink alcohol or do any other drug. :)<br /><br />Marijuana, like any other drug, legal or illict, isn&#039;t for EVERYONE. Those who are predisposed of certain types of mental illnesses should avoid using marijuana at all costs.

Doctors often simply assume SSRI&#039;s will be effective, while in some patients they are not at all, sometimes worsen the problem, or have side effects such as sexual dysfunction that can make your quality of life worse rather then better overall. <br /><br />That said, i&#039;m not stating that they are not effective. For some people they do a great job treating problems like moderate depression or anxiety. For others they seem to be less effective, and the side effects simply overshadow the benefits. Sadly, medical practitioners seem somewhat ignorant of that, and will even try another ssri (sometimes multiple ones) to see if it can be made effective after all. <br /><br />Trying ssri&#039;s is fine - and you should be patient too as it can take several months to achieve full effects in some cases. As a biochemist, i would suggest that trying a -different- ssri after the first one failed is usually a waste of time since their mechanism of action is very comparable, and they all are effective. If one doesn&#039;t work at all, the problem is probably in some domain that cannot be treated with ssri&#039;s.

I don&#039;t care too much about politics behind marijuana but in my experience both anti-deprssants and marijuana in it&#039;s controlled usage has been great and justifiably so for many other people. all it takes is the wrong type of thinking of doing things like heroin and relying on physically addictive drugs whereas marijuana has no physical tolerance on the user. in fact anti-deprssants is more dangerous in that respect because one can develop a very mild withdrawls from suddenly stopping anti-deprssants regime.<br /><br />all in all, it&#039;s up to the individual, just because someone mentions marijuana as a remedy doesn&#039;t mean they are in the 420 crowd who are &quot;in your face&quot;. again just because you don&#039;t like marijuana and that it has had an increasing effect on your depression doesn&#039;t mean that someone else with a different set of reactions to marijuana shouldn&#039;t consider it.

Both of which come from plants. But wait... they&#039;ll say weed is straight from the plant and not processed! Does that mean that raw opium is OK and hash is not? I don&#039;t have anything against people smoking weed, more power to you&nbsp; :). I do however, find a lot of &#039;drug snobs&#039; are of the weed smoking variety, who will look down on other people for their drug of choice (including alcohol). Do we not all wish for the same goal in the end - to take back our personal right to consume whatever drug we like? United we stand, divided we fall? ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hang on there, heroin and cocaine are not consumable in it&#039;s own from the plant itself, it&#039;s refined, processed artificially. marijuana by itself can be consumed and there&#039;s no risk of human intervention.<br /><br />again the argument is circular. one can argue that anti-deprssants can increase suicidal behavior. mabye marijuana as well. all I&#039;m saying is those are the relatively safer choices compared to the otehr ones OP listed which are far more dangerous in it&#039;s own light. I don&#039;t care too much about politics behind marijuana but in my experience both anti-deprssants and marijuana in it&#039;s controlled usage has been great and justifiably so for many other people. all it takes is the wrong type of thinking of doing things like heroin and relying on physically addictive drugs whereas marijuana has no physical tolerance on the user. in fact anti-deprssants is more dangerous in that respect because one can develop a very mild withdrawls from suddenly stopping anti-deprssants regime.<br /><br />all in all, it&#039;s up to the individual, just because someone mentions marijuana as a remedy doesn&#039;t mean they are in the 420 crowd who are &quot;in your face&quot;. again just because you don&#039;t like marijuana and that it has had an increasing effect on your depression doesn&#039;t mean that someone else with a different set of reactions to marijuana shouldn&#039;t consider it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well i have two puffs of a joint, and it sends me into a paranoid psychosis. But i can smoke meth all day and it just relaxes me. I know im not of the majority but I do know of plenty of other people who get the same effect from these two as i do. This isnt about marijuana politics its just about realizing there is no way marijuana should be advocated as a cure for depression just because it may have helped you, because there is more than enough evidence that marijuana can induce psychosis in those predisposed.

Serious depression isn&#039;t easily treated by any drug, illicit or legal.&nbsp; <br /><br />A GP would probably prescribe you a combination or SSRI&#039;s and therapy, which may be a good thing in your situation. I&#039;m not inclined to suggest therapy for relatively minor problems, but by the time you are seriously considering suicide, i think it should be an option. It&#039;s extremely important that you do these things at the same time though, and not start on SSRI&#039;s before a therapist is available, since these drugs can sometimes make tendencies worse before doing you any good.<br /><br />It will not be a pleasant process, but sometimes you need to go through it to keep yourself out of harms way. Go have a talk with a GP with experience in such problems and see what options he suggests. You can always decline if you think its not for you, but at least you will get some good information on available treatments. <br /><br />Also, do not be embarrassed about the substances you used and actions you took - a good physician with experience in this field will know they are not that strange and not judge you for trying. Treatment is not about criticizing your past, but about how to proceed from where you are right now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think that is the big difference between the American model of medical provision and the British (I&#039;m assuming your referral to GP means British). The great shame of Britain is Andrew Lansley destroying, bit by bit, a great social institution that gives/gave free medical care for the population. We&nbsp; take it for granted most of the time until you hear about Americans and- no medical insurance- no treatment- no medicine- fuck off and die &quot;trailer trash scum&quot;! I can&#039;t imagine being in that position, with our Tory dominance in politics, selfishness seems to be the order of the day now, but still, if the OP was in Britain, I&#039;m sure you would have got the help by now. Don&#039;t give up on doctors yet, there can be so much difference between their mind sets regarding being judgmental about drug use and your position in general, eventually you will find the right help- the right person to help. Are there any mental health charities where you are, they could be a great source of support and direct you to the right people, being specifically mental health they would be a lot more tuned to your needs than a, what we call GP- General Practitioner. I would advice you to be very wary of some of the fringe, &quot;snake oil&quot; brigade as I&#039;m sure some are just in it for the money, and it&#039;s not their minds they are playing with- it&#039;s yours! Having said that, learning meditation techniques would be very beneficial for controlling your anxieties and allow you to direct your thoughts how you want, away from the &quot;bad ones&quot; . Not read the whole thread yet so not sure if you have tried it yet. Another thing is true meditation does not use any sort of drug- that would interfere with benefits of meditation. Don&#039;t give up, though I know it is easy to as I have been prone to depression, it can run in the genes, it&#039;s not because you are weak or lacking in anything, remember that the people who would try to put you down do it because of there own deep seated insecurities, otherwise they would not feel the urge to do as they do. That can be a powerful mental amulet of protection against that sort of person, think of a mental image of them in a ridiculous position- imagine you&#039;ve just caught them masturbating in a field wearing a shitty pair of nappies on their head or something similar, the meditation will allow you to produce powerful images in your mind- it&#039;s all about mind control. <br />Anyway, all the best, and hope you find some of this extended ramble of use!

				There are some good answers, and some incredibly stupid answers.<br /><br />People who think the solution to depression is to look at panda photos, have sex, or listen to good music, have obviously never experienced clinical depression.&nbsp; Such people are likely assuming that depression is the same as their own fleeting feelings of sadness. With real depression, you have a reduced capacity to even feel pleasure, even if you were to do all of these things. If you&#039;re just sad, you can be cheered up by having sex or something, but it&#039;s not the same with depression.

				I think exercise is a bogus answer too. I mean when youre suffering from deep depression, youre lucky if you can even get out of bed. IME it just isnt possible to exercise at that point. <br /><br />I will say i think exercise is a great suggestion to maintain a healthy and happy life after you address and work towards getting over the crippling depression first. Get to a doctors office and be honest and tell them exactly how youre feeling and what youre going through. Its a medical condition and can be treated.

Most of those who do, literally have something chemically wrong with them from birth, it&#039;s not a new feature, or else they were exposed to some kind of toxicity that caused brain damage.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that words like &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot; are so broadly categorized almost anybody can be slotted into them, because psychology is a bullshit science used by pharmaceutical companies to infantalize people into believing they are life&#039;s irrecoverable victims unless they pay $$$ for the magick beans *cough*, of course I mean pills.<br /><br />This is not pine trivializing people who feel blue or down. People who feel temporary melancholy do frequently kill themselves, so I&#039;m hardly saying it&#039;s not a problem. I am saying that is there a fuck ton of pseudoscience going on, similar to how placebos work, only in reverse. You tell people they have something wrong with them enough times, and they begin to believe it after a while. Work ethic slipping? Depression! B- instead of an A+? Depression! Accidentally cut oneself with a knife or tripped on a stage? Depression! Your girl/boyfriend left you? Depression! And so it goes. It actually reminds me of one of those tribes in central Africa or south east Asian islands, where a witch doctor will curse somebody, and the people believe in this so strongly that they do actually die due to the sheer stress of the belief in some cases, a sort of self fulfilling prophesy. I think some witch doctors still live among us.<br /><br />The real problem is that we have an entire society in which many people feel directionless, purposeless, powerless and some parts of the pharmaceutical industry feed off this. I think this is a new thing, that our ancestors didn&#039;t experience the general funk that I think has set in in the late 20th century onwards. This may be partly because they were outdoors more and worked physically (endorphin release combats blues), but I also think this is because society has become too centralized and people have become more despondent because of this. I can&#039;t put numbers on such a thing, but I&#039;m always stuck by the incredible optimism for the future that many libertarians have, even when they are seeing a dystopian future (or present), they seem to have a reserve of inner conviction and pride that makes them more independent, maybe seemingly more arrogant to others, but still!<br /><br />One of the smartest persons I know is categorized as autistic. There seems to be this myth, that unless you have everything, or are perfect, that you are expected to be unhappy, discontent with your current lot in life. <br /><br />Anyway, writing about depression doesn&#039;t make me any happier, so I&#039;ll stop here. But remember! Take the fight to the real enemy! Fatalism! You&#039;re fine :)<br /><br />P.S. I think platypus pictures are worth a lot more than you think...! I also think it&#039;s wicked that MDMA and LSD are considered illegal drugs when depression and anxiety medication is usually more dangerous by a long shot.

				Im not one for throwing medication at everyone. A lot of so called depression is just a rut or a brief period of sadness in ones life. <br /><br />But the OP sounds like hes dealing with some serious issues and could use some help. I went to the doctor after YEARS of suffering with anxiety and depression. I got tired of wanting to die and not giving a fuck about life or anything or anyone, myself included. <br /><br />The meds my dr gave me did nothing besides give me a headache, but taking that step and going to talk to someone def helped. Plus everyone around me noticed i was making progress. Addressing the issue and working toward a solution is what needs to be done to move forward IMO. Diet and exercise are crucial, but the first step is addressing the problem, and for me that came with a doctors visit. <br /><br />Just dont kill yourself because you cant get better if your dead, and you CAN get better.

There is nothing wrong with prescribing medication to such patients, in case of depression ssri&#039;s can be very effective, and in case of anxiety benzodiazepines can be very useful too. It is a fairly simple solution, and cost-effective too since most of the mainstream benzo&#039;s and ssri&#039;s are no longer under patent protection and hence available as very affordable generics.<br /><br />Depression that lasts for years without interruption is something else though. In such cases good research is required to find the source of the problem, the solution, or preferably both. Simply taking anti-depressants in that situation is like sending someone with a complex fracture home with painkillers, knowing fully well that those will never heal the injury, but may make someone more comfortable as long as they take enough of them.

				Obviously. <br /><br />But lets consider a situation where you can get any substance reasonaby easily - such as being allowed to purchase any medicine you like from a pharmacy without prescription (which sort of equates to silk road). In case you have been struggling for so long, would it not be a good idea to get expert advise on what to pick? <br /><br />I think we should all realize that not everyone buying for SR is doing so for recreational purposes, and many buyers in fact require some substance to lead a normal, functional life. Often some other users will be able to give very usefull advise for a given condition since they experienced it themselves, or had a close friend/relative in such a situation and remember what helped them out of it.<br /><br />I assume few people have had an experience similar to what was detailed in this topic. Given that, i would still recommend seeking medical attention. Also, i want to emphasize that talking about prior use of illicit substances with any medical practitioner is protected under doctor-patient confidentially, so you can be perfectly honest about it without any legal consequences. <br /><br />This is an important factor: you can tell your doctor in confidence what substances you have tried thus far (illicit or not), and i would recommend you do if you want to find a treatment more quickly. Doctors are generally familiar with the effects of numerous substances, and getting a good picture of which ones did not work (regardless of legal status) will help to expedite diagnosis and treatment. <br /><br />You may feel embarrassed to share what options you have tried, which is perfectly understandable. Keeping such information will, however, severely delay proper diagnoses while you suffer no risk when you do share it. If you want the best and fastest route to effective treatment, i would recommend finding a doctor you are comfortable with, and be transparent about you substance use history.&nbsp;

				My friend&#039;s idiot doc gave her a prescription for Wellbutrin SR... helped the depression a little but more than anything it just made her horny (if you saw her you&#039;d realize this isn&#039;t a good thing.... don&#039;t worry she&#039;s not on the forum). Anyway, she stopped taking it and has gone back to drinking.<br />.... We now stock 150MG Wellbutrin SR for depression, thanks katy :)<br /><br />On a more serious note, I&#039;m a firm believer that using depressants (alcohol especially and maybe weed) are a major contributor to her depression. Also, she was diagnosed with borderline low thyroid, which accounts for her weight gain and probably why she&#039;s often tired. In your case I&#039;d suggest like what people said above, find a county (state even) that offers free health care clinics. At the very least go to the ER (And if you don&#039;t want to pay the bill use a fake name) and say you&#039;re suicidal. They should GIVE the actual anti-depressants or at the very least have you talk to a trained doctor who will give you a script. And finally, as much as pretty much EVERYONE hates to hear this, there are a lot of people I&#039;ve know on the verge who turned to 12-step programs (AA, NA, Overeaters anonymous) who live happy lives now. I like some recreational fun from time to time, but I know when it starts to affect my life and loved ones that it&#039;s time to get help.... hell, think of 12-step meetings as free psychology but in group format.<br /><br />I could be wrong, don&#039;t listen to me haha

				Loner, have you excluded any physical/medical conditions that could be causing you to feel like this?<br />At least you&#039;re doing the right things - exercise, diet, supplements etc.<br />I found counselling, talking therapy helped to open up to someone else but not with the actual depression per se.<br /><br />Hope you have a good friend to support you through this ... and I suggest you try Life Coaching, helped me no end&nbsp; as well as a Myers Briggs personality test along with that - its about understanding your personality traits and accepting yourself for the person you are. <br /><br />Always remember &#039; Depression is a curse of the strong :)&#039;<br />Good luck in your search for happiness ....

				that&#039;s horrible... I think things are VERY different throughout the country. It&#039;s so busy around here the docs release people brought in by the police on 5150 holds as soon as they say they aren&#039;t suicidal/homicidal. Sometimes within hours. I suppose it would be prudent to research your local facility and definitely use a fake name. And that&#039;s the local county hospital for people without insurance I&#039;m talking about... individual rooms, high staff to patient levels, overall nice facilities. I&#039;ve toured them but that&#039;s about it - they could put on a nice show for us also, who knows.

There are so many things that seem at first glance to be unrelated to our struggle against the state, but which are fundamentally connected.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just mental health institutions such as that you describe. It&#039;s this cancerous malaise that hangs over the west in general. You can almost taste it in the air in certain places. In desolate ghettoized housing developments where the people have given up hope of a better world, to the fatalism of present day folks lining up at voting booths who know full well their vote counts for nothing: all this lack of life comes from the dead hand of the state. So yes, the state IS responsible for mental ailments. <br /><br />The market won&#039;t solve everything, it isn&#039;t a cure all. But the sheer level of inadequacy of the state, it might feel that way! <br />

				Hi, Loner (and others experiencing similar situations),<br /><br />Sorry to hear about what you&#039;re going through.&nbsp; This world can be a fucked-up place, and losing one&#039;s way is pretty understandable.&nbsp; One of The ILF has definitely been in a fight with depression for a decade or so and recently experienced quite a flare-up, so he has an idea of what you&#039;re going through.<br /><br />Hear what you&#039;re saying regarding alcohol, cannabis, and (what I assume were full-on rolling doses of) MDMA.&nbsp; So on to some other suggestions ...<br /><br />Taking San Pedro or another Mescaline-containing cactus can be a very healing experience.&nbsp; In normal amounts, it tends to be a very gentle, patient teacher.&nbsp; It can also leave one with a nice after-glow that lasts for a week or longer. <br /><br />Bumps of Ketamine can also be good for quickly shifting thought patterns.&nbsp; K can, however, lead to exploration of disturbing areas of the sub-conscious, possibilities which one really dreads.&nbsp; So it might not be all sunshine and rainbows in the initial trips.&nbsp; Perhaps here, and in general, one should have patience and learn not to fight what one cannot control.&nbsp; A particular possible negative outcome in life that you are fearing is just that: one alternative among a multitude.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be more likely than the positive ones, and you can rest assured that if you have done what you can to manifest a better outcome, you need not be fearful or shamed.&nbsp; Sometimes we assign far too much weight and pay way too much attention to terrible things that aren&#039;t ever going to happen.&nbsp; K can help to explore this, and recent studies indicate that its non-abusive use may even physically heal the brain.<br /><br />Micro-dosing MDA here and there can be nice also!&nbsp; It&#039;s like a tiny roll without the comedown.&nbsp; Very useful for getting more energy, having more empathy, and finding more joy in daily activities.&nbsp; Tolerance can come into effect, so this might not be an every-day solution forever.&nbsp; But a week or so of 10 or 20 mg dosed a few times a day might get one back into a groove.<br /><br />I think using drugs to get yourself out of the worst of a depressive hell isn&#039;t necessarily to be frowned upon.&nbsp; Sometimes we all need a little help or push.&nbsp; You&#039;ll ultimately find your way if you take it one step at a time and seek out what your truest desires are.<br /><br />Good luck.

				I know I&#039;m pretty late to the game, but OP:<br /><br />For the love of God, please go and seek professional help.<br /><br />Ignore every other silly response you got here. You need to go seek professional help ASAP.<br /><br />You said you had trouble with some doctors. Well it depends on which doctors you went to see (for example a GP vs a psychiatrist/psychologist) and what exactly you told them. Please don&#039;t let this stop you from seeking professional help.

				@loner<br /><br />My recommendation is that you find a physician that you trust. It may take a while to find one, but don&#039;t go back to one you don&#039;t trust, because it won&#039;t work out. Instead keep getting a new one for your next appointment until you&#039;ve found one that works. Tell the physician you trust that you you have tried everything you can think of, that you eat well, exercise, sleep well, take care of your body and your social life best you can. Tell the physician that now you want to try medication, because you feel that if life doesn&#039;t get any better it&#039;s not worth it. Probably you will first get to try SSRIs, which have been proven to be effective in blind studies with controls. The first month of taking the medication you will likely have sympthoms caused by the medicine, that make you feel worse, but hold on. After a month, sometimes 6 weeks, the effect will start kicking in. It may not be a major effect at all, but what happens for most people is that the &quot;dips&quot; don&#039;t go as deep. Don&#039;t expect a huge difference, but if you have a small one, it is time for you to start seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis. This is also difficult because you need to find one who can connect with you, and it probably won&#039;t be the first one you try. More likely it will be the tenth you try. A good psychologist can help you change your thought patterns and routines, and the reason I&#039;m saying you need the medicine, is that the medicine will give you the (energy) boost you need to be able to make use of what the psychologist says. <br /><br />It may also happen that the SSRIs give no effect whatsoever for you, and in that case, there are many many more medications to try. There are different kinds of SSRIs and just because one doesn&#039;t work, another may, but there are also medicines with other targets and mechanisms. MAO inhibitors and tri-cyclic antidepressants are two other categories of anti-depressants (forgive me if I mixed up their names), which don&#039;t get as good results as SSRIs in studies, but for some people they do work. <br /><br />You also mention that you hear voices in your head even when you are not on drugs. I am not saying that you have schizophrenia, but I think you should tell the physician or psychologist about these voices, so they can evaluate you. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				In all honesty, Loner, please see a psychiatrist. This is the first step to finding the help you need.<br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in situations like this - the wrong advice can seriously harm someone, if not kill them. Psychiatric disorders are nothing to mess around with, and I&#039;m almost 100% sure nobody here is a psychiatrist, or is sufficiently educated enough to give accurate medical advice to someone they know nothing about - why? because no medical professional would (in their right mind) do such a thing. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that psychedelics cannot be beneficial, but the first thing you need to do is get assessed and properly diagnosed. If your doctor prescribes a medication - take it. Most anti-depressants and anti-psychotics take a few weeks to actually do their job. So don&#039;t give up if you don&#039;t miraculously see results. It takes time, patience, and a good attitude. <br /><br />Loner, if you read this, please take the only sound advice being offered here - see a psychiatrist. <br /><br />sdesu

This could include things like panic disorder, for which there is little evidence on the benefits of ssri&#039;s.<br /><br />Considering the side effect profile of ssri&#039;s they really are not a drug that would improve the quality of life for the average person at all, and should only be used in cases where there is sound clinical evidence they are effective for the exact condition observed. <br /><br />As for smoking tobacco: this can be surprisingly effective when dealing with stress related problems, but since it lists &#039;slow and painful death&#039; as a side effect in bold lettering on the pack, i doubt it will gain much popularity as a treatment. Nicotine as such may still prove beneficial though, and when taken in a different route from smoking, be relatively safe too. Downside is that it is still bloody addictive, and the treatment of choice for nicntine withdrawal is - tadaa - ssri&#039;s ;)

Heroin is a temporary fix (and not effective at all, mind you) and should not be recommended to anyone facing such emotional issues, especially suicidal thoughts.

				I suppose thats not an easy question to answer. Since a heroin habit is so expensive to maintain, most addicts will eventually result to crime to fund it, and then end up in prison and/or rehab environments.<br /><br />It is an interesting hypothetical scenario though - of heroin was as cheap and legal as beer, what would actually happen?

				My comment might have been covered already, but I want to tell you, I know, in my own way a bit of what you are a going through. Weed makes me worse too, benzos just put me to sleep and drown it till i run out. only one pill has really helped me and cleaned up my view of the world.<br />Speed, only because I feel better when I&#039;m not insatiably stuffing my face, makes me feel productive instead of sleeping the day away and eating.<br />Speed got me to the gym, helped me lose the last 40lbs of my 150lb weight loss.&nbsp; Maybe give a small does a try. Also as gay as it sounds, writing is a great outlet for your feelings, as is most art. I&#039;d say take an addy and get creative...release some of your negative feelings that way. <br /><br />And from experience, heroin only makes it worse. But I won&#039;t nag you on that, your body, your choice. <br />I truly hope you find some relief.

Couple this with practice&#039;s such as Yoga, Qi Gong, meditation etc, and you will have some great foundational tools to potentially begin to thrive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our society as a whole does not have the mechanisms set in place to be able to universally provide our brothers and sisters with a holistic approach to these problems. Instead we are stuck in a pill based, synthetic, symptomatic approach to health.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, perhaps you could have a look at these aspects....<br /><br />- What kind of people do I surround myself with? Do they support my needs as a human?<br />- What is my diet like? This is one of the biggest ones for poeple in this day and age. The chemistry of your body plays a major part in how we think and feel. Organic food plays a huge role, as do the types of preparations of different food. If you want to pm me I am more then happy to offer nutritional advice.<br />- What kind of music do I listen too?<br />- Perhaps you could think about taking up a practice such as Qi Gong. Over the years I have seen amazing results emerge from people who have discovered Qi Gong. The four foundational forms alone are enough to support beneficial results, and can be practiced for half an hour every day or two.<br /><br />And least I forget, the most important aspect is love and knowledge of self. How you go about achieving this is entirely up to you. It could be a thought you say to yourself everyday or it could be spoken out loud. It could be about forgiving yourself and accepting all that you are. It could be about looking in the mirror and speaking the words. Just know in your heart that it is a journey, and while you are working at it, it will take time to begin to manifest. Be gentle and kind to yourself, in your actions and your thoughts!!<br /><br />Much love on your quest :)
