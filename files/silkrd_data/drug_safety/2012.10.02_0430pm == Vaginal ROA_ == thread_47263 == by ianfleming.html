				I have a friend who asked me about trying 2c-x or MDMA via vaginal administration.<br />Since I&#039;m not familiar with this ROA I didnt know what to tell her. I ran this by my uncle (a paramedic) and he thought that while it would bi-pass primary metabolism, he also said that it would most likely not be as effective as rectal usage as there are less capillaries and there are other fluids that might wash things away.<br /><br />However, I still dont have any very good knowledge on this topic. Has anyone here EVER tried this with any drug? Does anyone here know anything at all about this subject?<br />How effective is it vs rectal and oral administration (as in speed and potency)?

				I have a friend that has tried 2C-E vaginally to avoid the nausea. The experience was good with 50 mg:s of 2C-E in solution, as far as I can tell it was very similar in effects to rectal administration. She has no experience with rectal adminstration herself so it&#039;s hard to say but anyway it worked really well and was comfortable, just a minor burning sensation and the onset was quick, in fifteen minutes she was tripping hard.

				50mg of 2c-e?<br />Are you fucking serious? <br />This friend and I usually stick to 10mg 2c-e when dosing orally.

It also explains why 0000&#039;s&#039; friend needed 50mg, the absorption rate is terrible (a bunch of women ran an experiment over on bluelight with mdma, 2c&#039;s, etc). <br /><br />Tell her to grab a 3cc syringe, dip the tip into some coconut oil, and plug with that ... it&#039;s not uncomfortable at all.

				Actually it worked quite well. We have got used to taking 60 mg+ trips orally and 20+ nasally. (Yes, it&#039;s 2C-E, most of our friends would not take more than 20 mg but quite honestly that amount doesn&#039;t do much to me)

				That&#039;s weird, just last night I stumbled upon a thread on Erowid about a group of ladies sticking all manner of things up their jack-and-dannies!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=26033

				the vagina is not connected to the digestive system so any drug that&#039;s orally active will not work...<br /><br />however drugs that are sublingually active like LSD, NBOMe&#039;s, and DOx&#039;s should theoretically work...<br /><br />another caveat is that the vagina maintains a specific pH which is linked to a woman&#039;s reproductive health...putting chemicals that aren&#039;t intended to be down there could throw this pH off and cause health issues down there...
