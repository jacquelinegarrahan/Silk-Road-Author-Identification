				So the last couple weeks I&#039;ve done more coke than I ought to that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; My nose had started showing a little bit of blood every now and then when I blew it for a few days but that didn&#039;t worry me too much as I have pretty sensitive sinus tissues.&nbsp; However, today the blood came out a couple times pretty thick and really bright red.&nbsp; Needless to say I&#039;m definitely going to take a break from putting anything up there for a while.<br /><br />But since I&#039;ve been snorting shit for several days now with obviously open wounds, I&#039;m nervous about the potential for infection from stuff still lingering around up there.&nbsp; I know the body can fight stuff off but I&#039;d like to help minimize risk in any way possible here.&nbsp; <br /><br />1)&nbsp; How would I know if an infection started?&nbsp; <br />2)&nbsp; Is there anything I can do to minimize the chance of a serious infection?&nbsp; Are saline solutions a good or bad idea?&nbsp; Should I rub some neosporin on a Q-tip and rub it around up there?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m really just concerned because obviously I can&#039;t see the damage or signs of an infection since it&#039;s way up my nose. <br /><br />Advice from anyone with medical training would be highly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you :)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				What i always do after is, cleaning my nose with warm water with a little salt in it.<br />Just snorting a bit of that water should help clean it up.

				could try the neosporin/polysporin on a q-tip.<br />I have done this before and it defiantly made the healing process faster.<br />also (this is sorta common sense) but don&#039;t sniff anything else until your nose is healed&nbsp; :P<br /><br />cheers!

				thanks :)&nbsp; yeah I realize it&#039;s not the healthiest habit.&nbsp; but infections can be deadly and i might be a little over concerned but i&#039;d rather be safe than sorry.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have seen someone have to have their leg amputated -- not even kidding -- because a simple cut got infected and got real bad in just a matter of days.&nbsp; <br /><br />granted, the damage inside the nasal cavity is a bit different because it&#039;s surface level and granular, more like a sand paper scrape than a knife wound, so the healing should take place a lot quicker and antibodies should (if my health education is worth anything) have an easier time limiting infection spreading beyond the wound site.&nbsp; and sinus infections are very common of course.&nbsp; i just don&#039;t like the idea of some nasty infection right near my brain. <br /><br />my brain&#039;s already infected enough with habits like this ;p

				What I do to try and keep my nose healthy is use a saline nasal spray to keep my nose from getting too dry and also to flush my sinuses (by tilting your head to one side and gently allowing the solution to flow into your upper nostril it starts dripping from the other nostril). The flushing process was something I was skeptical of once upon a time but I find it&#039;s very helpful to keeping your nasal passages clean after all the shit we put up them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been able to find generic saline sprays for a couple bucks at any pharmacy or large grocery store.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the keeping it clean part down -- but I just wanted to make sure that if it was pretty bloody that putting saline solution up there wasn&#039;t going to&nbsp; hurt the healing process or worse, or if there are other things I can do to help it heal faster and keep it as infection-free as possible (hence the neosporin question).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard using stuff like Flonase or any steroids is an absolutely terrible idea, btw, if there is a wounded nasal cavity as it will actually worsen the damage somehow (increase scar tissue or something?)&nbsp; Forget the details but yeah, from what I&#039;ve heard don&#039;t use anything medicated, straight saline.

Thanks for clarifying. I only use plain saline sprays and, although I can&#039;t say for sure, I have used them when I&#039;ve bloodied my nose and I believe it&#039;s helped (at the least, it didn&#039;t cause any problems). I think it&#039;s safe to use those even when your nose is bloodied is because the spray is designed to go through the nasal passages without damaging them (if you try just regular water it burns the hell out of your nose but the right saline/distilled water solution won&#039;t). <br /><br />I think the suggestion of neosporin or some antiseptic gel on a q-tip is a good idea: I would do that and then follow it up with a saline flush if you&#039;re concerned about complications from using the saline solution while having a bloody nose but, since the spray is supposed to be sterile, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything to worry about.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Aside from the harsh cuts that may be doing damage by it self, cocaine is a vaso constrictor.<br /><br />It constricts blood flow in the membranes where coke is getting contact with and well with prolonged use and on top of harsh cuts, the skin actually starts dying and falling off...hence the sore nose and blood involved.<br /><br />Best idea is to use a saline spray or neti pot and clean your nose and sinus cavities out about 2 hours after your last line or something.<br /><br />Do that and blow your nose and repeat 1-2 times more.&nbsp; Your nose will thank you.

				Looking after your nose<br />Long term snorting can result in:<br />Necrosis:Necrosis (death) of the lining of the nose can cause a hole to develop in the septum (the cartilage that separates the nostrils).<br />Sinusitis: Inflammation of the sinus which can result in headaches, facial pains and/or nasal discharge.<br />Nosebleeds.<br /><br />Maybe the most effective means of looking after your nose is to make sure that you give it a break. Your nose is not a vacuum cleaner and gets damaged by constant exposure to drugs. Having a break from snorting gives your nose a chance to heal.<br /><br />How to douche your nose<br />A nasal douche of luke warm salt water can also help reduce the risk of infection and also help minimise the damage done by snorting.<br />Dissolve ¼ teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water.<br />Pinch your thumb and forefinger together and pour a little of this solution over them.<br />Sniff it in gently so a warm salt spray is spread over the membranes inside your nose.<br />Commercial nose sprays are pretty rough on nasal passages that are already irritated by cocaine and so should not be used frequently.<br />Also I suggest using some Vaseline after you have snorted just on the inside of your nose will reduce the risk of Necrosis
