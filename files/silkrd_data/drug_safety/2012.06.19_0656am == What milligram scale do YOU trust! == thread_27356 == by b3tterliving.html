				Looking to get a good mg scale that would be accurate +/- 2 or 3mg for weights under 10mg as many of the compounds im interested in are active at very low doses. So i was hoping someone could point me in the right direction towards a scale they would trust with such precise measurements. I have about $200usd to spend. Thanks in advance. - b3tterliving.&nbsp;

				I find it hard to trust any scale as-is. The best way is really to check against a know weight to see if it is -still- accurate. You could simply pipet 20 uL of water onto a weighing dish a couple of times to check if it responds 20 mg after taring. The gempro one linked seems to be a good choice though, and it comes with a built in level so you can assert it is sitting on a level surface too. <br /><br />With any scale, no mater the quality/cost, it is required to verify accuracy once in&nbsp; while though. <br /><br />

				My dank ass eyes.<br /><br />I need to buy a scale but the process I find ideal is as follows.<br /><br />Buy a scale weighing down to .01. This is more than enough for 90% of commonly available RC&#039;s.<br /><br />If you need to fine tune a dose to less than 10mgs your best bet is to weigh out a .01 dose and then eyeball 10 even parts. Shouldn&#039;t be too hard.<br /><br />Then simply add the mgs as desired.<br /><br />This works very well and also gives that I don&#039;t know whats coming feeling after you take your cap :)

				So for my small measurements i have a Gemini-20 and it is a small milligram scale. It is stupid accurate and consistent, i am anal about calibration and i calibrate it quite often but it doesn&#039;t take any time to calibrate It is pretty well priced on amazon think after shipping i payed like 40 bucks, might have been a little less then that. A lot of people i know use this same scale for the very small measurements. It only goes up to 20g&#039;s but that isn&#039;t what i use it for i have a Durascale100 that weighs out to .01g&#039;s and to 100g&#039;s that scale was pretty pricey but still an excellent scale for weighing out oz and still have that great accuracy. if you want a really good one go to you local high school and pay a kid to get one out of the chem labs :-) ok that would probably bring some bad karma I&#039;m not a fan of stealing but yeah those are the scales i use and love. Good luck

				It&#039;s also important to deal with scales appropriately: A 1 mg resolution scale is not something to be used to measure 1 mg quantities. The lowest amount you could usefully measure with it is 10 mg, and 100 mg reliably. <br /><br />Accuracy of scales is often defined as some percentage of deviation, plus some absolute error that is acceptable. This could, for example, be 1% +/- 2 digits. On a 1 mg resolution scale, a reading of 5 mg could essentially mean &quot;2 to 8 mg&quot;, whereas a reading of 100 mg would be &quot;96 to 104 mg&quot;.<br /><br />If you wish to measure weights in the order of 1 mg accurately, you need to get something far more expensive. Analytical balances with 10 ug resolution surely exist, but they are insanely expensive (price of a luxury car) and require to be set on a solid, level, vibration-free surface to work well too.

Sometimes when you load your material, it doesn&#039;t even register that something&#039;s there until you dump in a good chunk of material. This can be potentially dangerous with 2C&#039;s, or MDPV, where a 5-10mg error may mean the difference between a nice euphoric experience or several hours in paranoid hell.<br /><br />Most researchers don&#039;t need a scale that&#039;s very accurate because dosages on average are not under 20mg. When my scale broke, in order to dose 2C&#039;s I just dissolved a gram in water and dosed from a known volume.

				Always good to invest in a set of good test/calibration weights as well - I like scientific scales but like someone above pointed out they are around 1k for good ones, in the past I have often used gunpowder scales - they are not too expensive and are very accurate but they do not usually have a very high capacity.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Kind of like this one - capacity of 120 grams, count feature for a little more than $300 <br /><br />Sartorius Scale made by ACCULAB<br />This scale goes way beyond reloading scales commonly offered on the market. This precision scale weighs to 2/100th of a grain instead of 1/10th as most other reloading scales. The large footprint provides a very stable weighing platform. The scale has a glass air shield, a flip-up hard cover, a calibration weight, an integral centering bubble level, and adjustable feet. The scale can weigh in grains or grams. A nice feature of this scale is the weight percentage function that is useful when sorting brass. It also has a weight counting function (useful for counting bullets). the Sartorius scale has a TWO (2) YEAR WARRANTY. Capacity: 1852 grains. Scale Weight: 2.6 lbs.
