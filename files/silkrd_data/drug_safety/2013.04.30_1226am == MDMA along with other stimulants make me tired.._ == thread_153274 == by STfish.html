				I&#039;m just curious as to why this happens to me. I&#039;ve bought MDMA on here a handful of times and only had the security of getting it tested once, where it went straight to black. Whenever I take it and start rolling, it usually hits me really hard and makes me yawn alot and want to sit down and chill out. I still vibe with the music and after about like 30-45 minutes of just chillin and some intense eye wiggles, i&#039;m good to go and rage for the rest of the night. Also, when I talk when i&#039;m rolling really hard my voice like drowns out and I literally go deaf for a second, but only when I talk, other than that I can hear perfectly fine. Just curious if this happens to anyone else. I do like the effects, except for the tired and deafness parts obviously lol. Also, stimulants like addy and cocaine make me tired too. Addy makes me yawn alot and want to go to sleep, but I can&#039;t. Cocaine had the same effects (i&#039;m pretty sure the coke I did was cut to hell and back though). I&#039;m just wondering if anyone has similar experiences to me. My friend that loves amphetamines (speed in particular) takes higher doses than me and doesn&#039;t get any of the tired feeling but starts talking alot instead, he also said he&#039;s never gotten eye wiggles or anything of that sort when on molly. Any knowledge or experiences would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />STfish

				Yeah, thats not uncommon with mdma. As for the rest, stims have different effects on different folks.<br />I&#039;m not trying to pry, but how much in the way of psychoactives have you done, and how often do you use? How much have you rolled in total, just the handful of times? Same question for general stims actually. That info would help a lot.<br /><br />But yeah, lots of people shut down for a bit during the come-up, especially on clean mdma. Also, what is your dosing when you roll?

				Here that&#039;s an effect of (legitimate) ADD. I had a friend who&#039;d take codeine and he&#039;d get hyped up on it. He used to have to pretend to be a normal, well-behaved teenager so they&#039;d keep prescribing them as a treatment. Ritalin and the like just made him go to sleep from what I remember.

Its why people with add and adhd get prescribed adderall, ritalin and the like.

				Yeah I too get that with MDMA. I could go out to a bar/club if I wanted, but I could easily chill at home with friends. <br /><br />On high doses I&#039;ve found myself nodding off, but not really sleeping. I wasn&#039;t aware I was doing it until somebody pointed it out. <br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t like such high doses of MDMA, I find it fucks with my memory, my vision. I take smaller doses and I find it makes me a bit more sociable, but still fully aware of my surroundings.

				MDMA gives me the yawns on the comeup, but cocaine makes me super tired.&nbsp; Only good quality cocaine though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done lines and immediately gone to sleep, been woken up for more lines, and repeat many times.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also had a cocaine addiction in the past though, so that may change my experiences.
