				Is there any way to speed up an mdma roll?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to be able to roll during the day, but by the afternoon be normal again. I have a bit of Ivory&#039;s and Pfandleiher&#039;s stuff.<br /><br />Ideally I want to dose at 9am, have the best roll possible for 3 hours, then come down over the next hour, have a nap, then be totally normal by 4pm.<br /><br />Is this possible? How much should I take, and how should I take it?<br /><br />BTW&nbsp; I haven&#039;t taken any mdma in the last 10 years!!

				Not sure, but order some of Tryptamine&#039;s natural supplements. There&#039;s one for coming off of rolls easily and another to fall asleep with ease. Both sound like solutions to your problem&nbsp; :)

				I know people who, after a party, when they come home and cannot sleep, take some GHB, that&#039;ll knock em out so they&#039;re able to sleep for a few hours, and wake up totally fine, no hangover or lame ass feeling what so ever. <br /><br />Normal dose is 1.5mg/Kg body mass. So if you weigh 90 kilo, your perfect dose would be 135mg. For a nice 3hour ride I&#039;d say take about 70% of that number..

				I&#039;d advise either taking a small enough dose to have fun, yet stay in control. Another alternative would be taking a benzo during the later half of your roll, it would definitely tone it down a bit. :D

				The best ways I can think of to speed up the experience would be to get it working as soon as possible (so don&#039;t cap it, just eat/drink the crystal straight, parachute it, or snort it if that&#039;s your thing), and don&#039;t take as much as you would expect to take for a solid roll.&nbsp; If you snort it, you&#039;ll need even less, and it would probably be one of the fastest methods with a quick, intense come-up.&nbsp; Not for everyone.&nbsp; If you eat Ivory&#039;s (I&#039;m not familiar with Pf&#039;s), I agree with Knomo that you should take about 70% of your normal dose (which I would define more broadly, maybe in the range of 1.5-2mg/kg) for a faster, though lighter, experience.

And being that I haven&#039;t had any in 10 years, I&#039;d say there&#039;s a good chance I&#039;d be one of those people.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter if it ends up being on the lower side, I have enough over here that I&#039;m prepared to experiment to find the right dose.

Actually I need to gauge how hard this stuff will hit me, so I don&#039;t shit myself at a festival. :-)
