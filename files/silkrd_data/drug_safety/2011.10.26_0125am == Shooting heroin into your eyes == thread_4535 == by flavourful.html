				Please tell us that you didn&#039;t do this... this is almost like the post I read where someone actually tried to inject peanut butter because they heard that it makes you high... Its not smart injecting any type of drug to any place that a dr or pramedic wouldn&#039;t do.

				Someone&#039;s been reading too much Hunter S. Thompson. As far as I know this is an urban legend, never heard a substantiated account of someone doing it.<br /><br />Sticking a pin in your pecker on the other hand.. yeah, I&#039;ve seen a few junkies do that, and fingers, and toes.. not nice.

				I think this pole should have read &quot;Do you value your eyes?&quot;<br /><br />I really don&#039;t suggest anyone doing this but I&#039;m sure that would be anyone&#039;s gut reaction.&nbsp; Really you shouldn&#039;t inject any drug whatsoever but I know we are junky&#039;s.&nbsp; So please be clean and save always have new needles if this is not possible bleach them minimum 5 times and rinse with water minimum 5 times.&nbsp; Wipe your cooker with an alcohol swab to kill any germs before adding your gear.&nbsp; Use wheel filters if possible I know I cant always get them so I use tightly rolled prewetted cottons.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t pre-wet they expand when you drop them in and that pretty much defeats the purpose.&nbsp; As for veins you can use any of them basically, I suggest staying away from the femoral as you can hit the artery which is right next to it and bleed to death.&nbsp; Honestly I think I would use my pecker before my femoral and I would never use my pecker.&nbsp; I find the best veins to hit are on the top of my arms since when I hit up there I never bruise and there are a million of them.&nbsp; Always rotate veins never use the same one twice in a row as you don&#039;t want to destroy it.&nbsp; Anyway be safe everyone and don&#039;t cry...dry your eye!&nbsp; Haha I had to!<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy
