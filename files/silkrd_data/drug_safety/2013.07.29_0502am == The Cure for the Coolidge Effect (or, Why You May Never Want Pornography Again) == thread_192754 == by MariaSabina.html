				1) Find a loving partner.<br />2) Find DMT.<br />3) Be with your partner, who is down in the moment to have sex with you.<br />4) Take enough DMT to get into &quot;candyland,&quot; but still be able to interact with this physical world.<br />5) Watch in amazement as your partner transforms before your eyes into every possible (wo)man/alien/creature you could ever possibly desire to be intimate with.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; If you are afraid of the DMT space, a little valium and/or ketamine can help overcome this fear and enhance the experience.

				This sounds like it might have some powerful addictive quality to it.&nbsp; Is this the case?

				My partner only did it once so far and we are currently out of DMT, but he said it was fan-fucking-tastic and definitely can&#039;t wait to try again.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been together quite some time, so spicing up the sex life is always a worthy goal for a couple that&#039;s committed to monogamy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how addictive it would be, but probably about as addictive as having sex with a new partner at the start of a committed relationship, so something that happens a lot but isn&#039;t uncontrollable or anything.<br /><br />He took maybe 5mg of Valium and then did a line of at least 100mg of Ketamine -- he&#039;s a bit of a K hard-head -- to get himself into a relaxed, psychedelic state.&nbsp; Then he loaded two pipes, each with about 15mg of DMT.&nbsp; Smoked the first and let the effects come on.&nbsp; Then right as he was starting to peak on that, he smoked the second and said he was in that place the DMT Nexus defines as level II or what people call Candyland, but like way intensely (almost at level IIB).<br /><br />[clearnet]<br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/FAQ.aspx<br />http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Hyperspace_lexicon<br />[/clearnet]<br /><br />So, he saw me morph through scores of female shapes, which would change based on the slightest detail of my expression, my emotional reaction, the angle he was looking at me at, how he was feeling, etc.&nbsp; Any subtle change could lead from German barmaid to Indian goddess to Asian princess to playful fairy.&nbsp; The &quot;weirdest&quot; it got was my looking like an alien, but if you&#039;ve ever been into sci-fi, there are some pretty hot and tempting aliens that are imaginable.<br /><br />As for being horny, well, I think there&#039;s a couple of issues at work.&nbsp; One, he has a pretty strong sex drive and was already very much wanting to get down before he ingested anything, and he had just been involved with some porn and found it very unsatisfying.&nbsp; Two, if he&#039;s either very tense or very relaxed, sex can be very appealing to him.&nbsp; So the tension of the come-up coupled with the relaxing into the DMT space made for a very sexy head-space.
