				So like a lot of people I have the lovely condition of IBS which means that when I eat the wrong thing I get horrendous cramps and other lovely side effects that make me basically useless.&nbsp; this usually hampers me from getting burritos or Olive Garden, but with drugs like XTC or some pyscedelics I notice my stomach gets really messed up.&nbsp; I understand thats normal but I feel my condition makes it worse as I usually am much worse than my friends.&nbsp; Does anybody else have these issues or does any one have advice on how to make the experience smoother.&nbsp; I usually take 6x immodium and a ginger ale before rolling, but that seems to only do so much

				The problem is serotonin plays such a large role in the enteric nervous system you are going to be stimulating those pain and muscle responses unfortunately, and you just seem to possibly be more sensitive.<br /><br />There are certain sero antagonists for those with severe IBS-D which could potentially help but they often work too well and reduce the activity to a point that is extremely dangerous, even lethal. I was thinking the extra serotonergic activity may balance out, but I doubt anyones tried this combination.<br /><br />You may ask your doctor about some of the anti-cholinergics such as hyoscamine or dicyclomine which may help but I am not sure how well theyd mix with psychedelics. They do wonders for the cramping but have some annoying side effects though. They potentiate opiates too. <br /><br />I think unfortunately loperamide may be the best solution (12 mg is alot, though some in opiate withdrawal take practically an entire bottle), since it doesnt cross the blood brain barrier and will only be active in the ENS. Also take a regular otc pain med to take the edge of the stomach pain. Unfortunately the best thing to do for IBS is simply learn to avoid those triggers.&nbsp; Sorry to hear about your pain and difficulty!&nbsp; Good luck managing!<br />- miR

				I second everything microRNA said, but would like to add that Marijuana is known to be fairly effective in relieving IBS and is safe to take in combination with practically anything it seems. If I remember correctly, the intestinal track has loads of cannabinoid receptors and Marijuana has the effect of calming the intestinal track down in people with IBS or crohn&#039;s disease. It also helps to relieve pain in general, and dose not have the negative side-effects many of the traditional IBS medications have.<br /><br />Could be wrong, but a little pot is rarely a bad thing :p
