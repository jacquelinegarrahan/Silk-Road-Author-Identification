				I&#039;m trying to stick to oral use only of meth - in theory because it&#039;s &#039;safer&#039; and less prone to addiction, ageing, neurological damage like bringing on dementia and parkinsons etc, which scares the hell out of me..&nbsp; I only snort if I feel I really need to get something out of it or need a quick pick me up, but I really try to avoid it and stick to oral.<br /><br />My regime is mostly day based, and I try to take a pinch with baking soda both disolved in water, apparently that helps to reduce potential harm?&nbsp; As well as spreading it out longer, which is nice.&nbsp; I try not to take it too late in the day to avoid insomnia (but I still seem to overshoot often which sucks - see below).<br /><br />I also try to back it up with general health like green salads, lots of water and avoiding stuff like vitamins that acidify the liver which apparently forced meth out faster than an alkaline liver or body.&nbsp; I also try to take anti-oxidants, and I generally avoid carbs as they just suck in general anyway, so mostly stick to a paleo animal fat / salad / vegetable type diet which gets you pretty pumped on it&#039;s own.&nbsp; An added bonus being that an alkaline body is actually our natural state (from what I speculate) and helps prevent cancer and ageing and all that from &#039;oxidative stress&#039; associated with (what is now the typical norm in our modern crappy lifestyle and crappy food society) acidic bodies and livers.&nbsp; Acidic bodies do all sorts of crap, in addition to pumping out your treasured meth faster (?), not only age faster and look more crap earlier (we&#039;ve all seen the 40 something office worker who&#039;s just a fat lumbering embarassing wreck), is more prone to cancer (cancer rates have shot up from like 1 in 20 or something in the 80s to 1 in 2 now), leaches calcium from the bones so the body can try and balance it out, it&#039;s just crap... Coke and sugar, alcohol all acidify the body...&nbsp; Foods such as (ironically what we actually evolved to eat) salads and vegetables apparently help, but red meat and protein acidify the body?&nbsp; So maybe protein supplements and lots of protein while on this is not necessarily good?&nbsp; Argh I have no idea... You need to be well fed either way..<br /><br />And as all stimulants (including the widely abused and legal &#039;caffeine&#039;) are vaso-constrictors (blood vessel constrictors) I wonder if trying to open up the blood vessels and encourage blood flow is a good idea, especially peripheral cirulation if only to avoid premature ageing of something as important as our face so we don&#039;t age faster in appearance (which would really suck dogs balls).&nbsp; So I try to lay on moistorisers pretty thick while I&#039;m on it, all over, and I hear something packed with &#039;nitrates&#039; like beetroot or beetroot juice may help re-open the blood vessels and peripheral circlulation?&nbsp; If only to reduce strain on the heart too, which is a kinda important think to keep alive.. You&#039;re kinda screwed without that little clump of muscle.<br /><br />Also looking for even herbal teas to support circulation, digestion and the brain especially considering what we&#039;re doing to it.&nbsp; Stuff like Ginko Biloba, aniseed or whatever... any ideas there would be welcome too... Better to load up on something like that that will actually make you feel more pumped so you get more out of it, hopefully with less damge, or ideally, even healthier for it.. Now that&#039;s a good outcome (like say a healthy amount of stimulation like gym training, without causing injury or damage, that actually improves health if done smartly).<br /><br />And of course I try to hydrate as much as possible too, preferably spring or natural water if possible with an alkaline PH.<br /><br />The biggest problem I notice so far is insomnia even if I stop taking it in the late afternoon or early evening..&nbsp; Any advice on this?&nbsp; If anything it sucks because the next day I don&#039;t really get a lot out of it and feel I&#039;m wasting it.&nbsp; It just sucks the next day and I feel a bit disappointed with the result taking it a second time so I don&#039;t push it and just save it until after I get some decent rest.&nbsp; But the insomnia really sucks balls as I wake up at the same time every morning regardless.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a problem initially so perhaps I&#039;m just overshooting a bit seeing that oral use takes a while to come on so it&#039;s hard to tell if you&#039;ve taken enough.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really want a full on manic &#039;high&#039;, I just want to feel fully pumped but still in control and not feeling like a prematurely ageing aggressive loser.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to hit the right &#039;balance&#039; if I can, being especially cautious about neurological damage as I hear the dopamine receptors are especially prone to damage (which anti-oxidants can help with?).&nbsp; It also may very well be the anti-oxidants or something else I&#039;m taking with it that&#039;s pushing it out faster or reducing the effect, I have no idea.. But I don&#039;t just want to keep pumping the stuff in like a mad meth head either, if only to get the most value out of this and not blow heaps of money un-necessarily.<br /><br />That being said I&#039;m also interested in how to generally enhance the overall effect, not with yet more drugs - I&#039;m really fine with just this and I&#039;m very cautious with something like LSD or whatever.<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy with meth overall though, and have even given up weed... I love the stuff, so I really want to learn how to use it safely and ideally, at least not accelerate ageing and neurological damage.<br /><br />Anyone else have experience with oral use of meth?<br /><br />Would laying off for a few days help recharge the dopamine receptors and levels so I can get fully pumped again?&nbsp; Is there some sort of food I can take to help this?&nbsp; I heard it can take several days which kinda sucks?<br /><br />I really enjoy this stuff, you can even use it to reinforce certain behaviours like exercise by stimulating dopamine so you get &#039;hooked&#039; on target behaviours if you&#039;re smart about it, so I want my cake and to eat it too, I&#039;d really like to learn more about this so I don&#039;t wind up 60 looking haggard and crap and half demented and shaking all over with some parkinson&#039;s crap in an old age home... I&#039;d really like to keep kicking hard all my life if I can make that happen..<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that if I get this sorted out then the &#039;worst&#039; effect from this will be a meth induced dopamine driven behavioural obsession with healthy living...&nbsp; That can hardly be a bad outcome.. How ironic if meth could drive someone to be obsessively healthy.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s all down to the choices we make, if we treat things with respect or if we just go in like some crazed hedonistic tosser - and we&#039;ve seen what happens to those - pretty scary - and don&#039;t want to end up remotely like any of those losers.&nbsp; I want to be actually better off from this stuff, even if I have to give up everything else like alcohol and coffee.&nbsp; Price worth paying in my opinion.

				Very good points to consider...I&#039;m thinking about jumping into the meth game after screwing around with various research chems over the last two years.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have started to lose their lustre, so&nbsp; I decided I may as well go BIG or GO HOME.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now for me,&nbsp; the main thing with switching to meth is going to be the cost.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can skate by on 2.5-3 grams a week on RC&#039;s cuz they&#039;re cheap.&nbsp; &nbsp;But with meth, we&#039;re talking about a whole different ballgame.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if the 2.5 to 3 gram consumption pattern will continue under meth.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or will I want to increase my dosages?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or will it be strong enough where I could even get by on less per week than what I&#039;m used to..............it will be a bummer if my use pattern stays the same or intensifies under meth, b/c I won&#039;t have the funds to support it.&nbsp; &nbsp; So if anybody has any feedback about what I might encounter with switching over, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Such as, do you think I will use less b/c it&#039;s so much more potent that what I have been using?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or just the opposite, where I will end up loving it to death and BOOM a gram is gone in less than 24 hours.&nbsp; That would suck.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would appreciate any feedback people might have...thanks y&#039;all.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				My advice is to treat this stuff with intense respect and self discipline, it is after all well known to completely destroy the weak in will and weak in body.&nbsp; Hence starting this thread.&nbsp; They ban it for a reason.<br /><br />But used responsibly it seems to be a wonderful enhancement to life, even healthier than coffee I suspect.&nbsp; I may actually suffer from low dompamine anyway (I do generally get distracted very easily) so I may be self medicating, who knows, who cares really, as long as I&#039;m happy (and don&#039;t get caught or hurt anyone or myself or wipe out my career and life from being caught).<br /><br />From my experience 2.5 grams would wipe you out completely and you&#039;d be a wrecked meth head before you can say WTF.&nbsp; 0.1 grams can last me a week on moderate use, or a day going really hard with oral use.<br /><br />I have heard of people smoking 0.1 grams in an hour but that sounds extreme and trending to &#039;destroyed meth head&#039; from what little I know (but I am prone to fear with this I admit, maybe that&#039;s a good thing).<br /><br />My advice is start REAL low and, if you can, avoid direct ingestion like smoking, snorting etc... I understand that bypasses the liver and goes straight to the head.&nbsp; It must be a hell of a shock to the brain and can&#039;t exactly be good for brain ageing.&nbsp; I suspect I&#039;m already playing with fire as it is so I don&#039;t want to push my luck further if I can, but at the same time maxmise the kick I can get out of this.. <br /><br />Something I&#039;ve heard though is that meth damage is generally heightened or even maybe largely caused by crap druggy lifestyles... sitting on their butts talking and eating crap etc... the body is already under considerable stress with this in the sytem so why make it worse I say, I suggest instead try to go the other way and support the body, not pump it full of more crap like junk food or whatever which may very well cause people to look 50 at 30, which is kinda embarassing to wind up like that.

				All good points.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I like about stimulants in general is that they curb the appetite and pretty much make food uninteresting and eating a pain in the ass.&nbsp; Of course I make myself eat regular and small meals...healthy shit, lots of water.&nbsp; Lots and lots of water.&nbsp; &nbsp; So the food thing is actually pretty cool for me b/c otherwise i would be getting more pleasure from the act of eating and since I usually crave fatty foods and have low willpower...I usually pack on the pounds.&nbsp; Not so much with my synthetic dietary friend!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />That&#039;s great to hear I should be able to get by on a whole lot less quantity-wise than what I&#039;m used to......less than half a gram a week should be my goal then.&nbsp; My main route of ingestion has always been thru the nose, so I don&#039;t see that changing.....I may try eating to see if it prolongs the effects, etc.&nbsp; I will try to stay away from smoking it and there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m going to shoot it.<br /><br />Back to the nutritional supplements that may help lessen the production of free radicals and other stressors from the meth...I&#039;ve heard magnesium is a good supplement to take.&nbsp; Vitamin C....probably a good B-Complex.&nbsp; There are tons of amino acids that you can take to supplement the production of neurotransmitters, but these supplements get expensive.&nbsp; Shit like Choline, Tyrosine, Inositol, etc.....a person can go crazy (and broke) taking supplements to ward off any potential wear and tear on the brain and body.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think as long as you make yourself eat in a balanced way, drink water, and avoid too many all-nighters...that should be enough to defend against a lot of the negative shit that can build up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, and be obsessive about brushing and flossing...healthy mouth = healthy body.&nbsp; &nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the good tips............

				Snorting is still straight to the blood, it&#039;s still full on... You may end up needing a lot more than me if you do that but whatever works for you.&nbsp; It will also escalate much faster and be much more addictive, so my advice is watch that real carefully and maybe even ask a few trusted friends to keep an eye on you in case you do lose yourself and go a bit stupid or start to look haggard and aged.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried doing that with some very very trusted close friends, not to ask them to keep an eye on me specifically but just so they know and can alert me if I start changing and don&#039;t notice.&nbsp; So far so good, in fact I get compliments about how healthy I look now, maybe I&#039;ve over shot haha..<br /><br />Appetite supressing is a worry, remember this is an evolutionary fight / flight response that shuts down all non essential systems so you can fight off a threat or chase down prey.&nbsp; Digestion, facial circulation (hence the rapid ageing), immune system, the lot, were not exactly essential in a fight for survival, and yes we did not evolve to &#039;fight&#039; for days on end so yeah that&#039;s an incredibly stupid thing to do too.&nbsp; So you may need to force yourself to eat something solid or you&#039;ll just end up starving yourself and look like those weedy pathetic meth heads with hoodies and attitude and a big homie rapper thing going on... Urgh...&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to lose muscle if you can avoid it, chicks and people in general don&#039;t like scrawny half starved men.&nbsp; Something to consider too.<br /><br />Load up on (healthy) animal fats, you&#039;ll be fine and dance and f... all night long.<br /><br />And fats are actually good for you contrary to all the bullshit peddled by cereal and diet food companies.&nbsp; It&#039;s sugar, especially fructose (which is in everything now, and they use the worst nastiest cheapest crap they can find - corn syrup) that makes you fat.&nbsp; If you cut out sugar, wheat, bread, milk, all that crap we did NOT evolve to eat... watch what happens... It&#039;s crappy fats like high heat cooked fats that are the problem, not healthy animal fats... How many &#039;low fat diets&#039; have you ever known to actually work for anyone... Think about it.&nbsp; Sugar is shit.&nbsp; Fat rules... load up on (healthy) animal fats when you&#039;re on meth I say, if anything the energy density will keep you fired all night unlike sugar which is like putting a turbo in to a golf cart... goes hard, until it conks out. May even help prevent muscle loss so you don&#039;t end up a scrawny pathethic meth head with all attitude and no chance of getting laid or a job, ever.<br /><br />Late nights full stop are just crap...&nbsp; sleep deprivation is an express route to a short and nasty life all the while finding it harder to pick up chicks looking crap and aged.&nbsp; Not a good way to go.&nbsp; I&#039;d still like to get laid if I can help it.&nbsp; Let the other meth heads take themselves out of the competition, I encourage them in fact.<br /><br />So I also try to get good sleep if I can (hence concerned about insomnia which seems easy to bring on with this).<br /><br />Thanks for reminding me about choline, that may be my problem!!! I&#039;ll go down some raw eggs now you reminded me.. cheers.&nbsp; Eggs are loaded with choline, I completely forgot.. You rock...&nbsp; Cheers.<br /><br />Maybe I was just running low on choline and couldn&#039;t get the dopamine engine fully fired up.. I wonder if I&#039;ll need to load up on eggs for a few days and give it a rest for a bit then.&nbsp; If only to get some solid sleep in.<br /><br />More dopamine build up the better eh..&nbsp; Bring it on.<br /><br />--- Added ----<br /><br />I owe you big time, I downed a raw egg (may as well hit it up hard if I was deficient) - I swear I felt better immediately. Whoa... Is that even possible???&nbsp; I guess eggs are easy to digest, bet like the nutritional equivalent of meth perhaps... I&#039;m wondering if downing two or three raw eggs a day is a good idea now too... Yellow / white and all.&nbsp; Snakes do it and they seem totally fine, they don&#039;t exactly fry it up before downing their prey&#039;s eggs either...&nbsp; But I think you are not meant to do more than two or three eggs a day because of cholesterol or something?<br /><br />I&#039;ll try this for a few days and see what happens, I may owe you buddy.. Good advice there about choline.

				yeah eggs were the key.... downing two raw eggs before bed really helped...&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll just down one raw egg a day for two days and see how I go in a few days...&nbsp; I usually have eggs for breakfast but often forgot when I was &#039;indulging&#039; so maybe that was part of the problem.<br /><br />I completely forgot about choline and all the other good stuff in eggs.<br /><br />Animal fats are treated like evil when it really is sugar that is killing and hurting millions of people very year by obesity, stroke etc..<br /><br />I&#039;ll PM you with you age profile...&nbsp; Lets just say that people seem to think I look good for my age, not without a lot of hard work and sacrifice though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to undo that and age myself.&nbsp; I really want to enjoy old age and not sit there shaking and demented for a decade... that would really suck after spending a life paying working and paying taxes.<br /><br />That&#039;s my biggest concern with this - neurological damage because I hear that dopamine receptors are really sensitive to damage and &#039;oxidative stress&#039; - and you kinda need them like a heart for the brain.<br /><br />I guess nothing comes for free but no point making it worse than I already am - unless there is a way to even get health benefits from this if we&#039;re smart and have self control.<br /><br />And where has this thread been the whole time... It should be a standard link on meth vendor home pages...&nbsp; In fact I think Silk Road should stick link threads like this all over the Silk Road home page and under relevant categories.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0

				take the baking soda and water 30-40 mins after taking the dose. Baking sodea fucks meth up horribly. Also if you take b-soda+ water your body will recycle some of the meth that is in the urine building up in your bladder.35 to 50% of the meth you consume is deposited your next urination (given that&nbsp; your next voiding dosent occur within the next hour or 2 afterward.<br />If you sleep and eat, any&nbsp; neurological damage&nbsp; you&#039;d receive from small oral does would be inconsequential and virtually unnoticeable. Your brain will repair broken pathways over time, so long as your using your brain&nbsp; and learning , not tv watching and drinking.<br />Magnesium and Zinc supplements are something I cannot stress&nbsp; enough!&nbsp; My dosages of dextr- amp was getting out of control&nbsp; because&nbsp; of&nbsp; what i thought was a tolerance build up- someone suggested those supplement and my dosage cut immediately in half and remained manageable&nbsp; some 2 years after the fact.<br />Just take it with a water chaser- like a Pavlov&#039;s dog , somehow that bitter taste will become enjoyable eventually.

				A note on the magnesium supplement....I hear there are various kinds of magnesium out there on the market and you want a particular kind.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is shit magnesium and decent magnesium...is there anybody who can clarify this, and does it matter?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, magnesium oxide vs magnesium citrate.............thanks!!!

				Baking soda screws up meth how exactly?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; And it can *recycle* meth from the bladder?? So I could be waaaay overdosing if that&#039;s the case?<br /><br />I definitely need a micro scale, and will stay off meth for at least a week - is that a good start?<br /><br />
