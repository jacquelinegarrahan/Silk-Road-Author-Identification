				Hey guys, just wanted to share a little trick I discovered for vaping meth that some of you may or may not be aware of.<br /><br />The main benefit I found was it being much more difficult to &quot;brown&quot; the meth and testing this method on up to 1 point in my &quot;Sweet Puff&quot; meth pipe (these have a 90degree bend in the stem right before the bowl. Added benefit is the meth no longer collects in a layer along the walls of the top half of the bowl, in fact I&#039;m pretty certain you inhale it straight away.<br /><br />For reference, I usually vape anywhere between .5 and 1 point per bowl, I mainly use DubG&#039;s product (apart from when I need a quick local fix) and I&#039;ve got the standard technique down nicely. By the end of the bowl the meth does not brown, although it does tend to turn that creamy peachy colour although still without the bad taste. For the first 4 or 5 hits it always recrystalises into beautiful crystal clear windmills and spiderwebs.<br /><br />I usually like to wash my pipe between uses and don&#039;t wait for a large amount to collect on the insides to scrape off, so during a smoking session I usually use a twin or triple jet lighter along the outside of the top of the bowl to clean the walls so that I can see the meth easier. I do this every 2nd or 3rd pull and&nbsp; usually after I burn this collection off, I put the pipe down to cool it nicely before taking the next hit.<br /><br />So the other night I was distracted and right after I did this collection burn off (by which time the meth at the bottom had recrystalised) I went ahead to take the next hit using my regular flame lighter. Once the meth melted and I started twirling the pipe, I didn&#039;t see any vapour come out, but when I started to pull on the pipe while twirling heaps of vapour came out and no collection was left on the top half. I think the reason for this is that normally the smoke is created due to a temperature differential the melted meth feels while being moved between the heated and slightly cooler parts of the bowl plus the cool air from the carb of the bowl once you start the hit. With this trick, the walls of the bowl are about the same temp so only the cool air from the carb provides this temperature differential.<br />I continued to do this until the end of the bowl, despite there no longer being a need to burn off the collection. The melted meth always came back to a near crystal clear solid form and the vapour continued to taste very clean and not burnt at all despite me putting the flame much closer than normal.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m certain you can still easily boil the meth by having the flame too close as per normal but I have so far avoided boiling it by being careful.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m by no means an expert, have only been vaping meth on and off for a few months but I do like to perfect technique for everything I do in life, and this is no exception.<br /><br />I welcome any comments, suggestions and kicks in the head for possibly wasting good product!<br /><br />As a side note I&#039;ve also (I think) perfected the hot rail method and love it for what it does - gives you the ability to vape a crapload of meth at once if you need an instant hurry up!

				It sounds to me like the difference you made here was heating the bowl up some before you tried to take a hit, unless I&#039;m reading it differently. I know that for other base pipe adventures, including DMT, it&#039;s advised that you do just that before taking a hit, though I&#039;ve never seen the benefit of that technique, personally.<br /><br />I will say you really made me want to smoke some more, though, haha.

				My trick is by dripping a drop of water to melt and wash out the residues.&nbsp; Keep this lovely concentrated drop then heat up untill smokes back.&nbsp; Cool down the smoking drop right away. <br /><br />A DECENT dope will be right in front of your eyes&nbsp; 8)

I tried it today but not sure if I did it correctly...<br /><br />Dropped about half a point in a clean pipe bowl, then dripped a drop of water... some of the solid matter melted/liquified however some crystals remained solid...<br />I then started heating it gently and shortly the water started to lightly boil. I kept heating it gently and moving the flame further and closer until I believed the water itself had evaporated and the remaining puddle was just the ice..<br />After it cracked back, there was slightly more sheen or shine to the crystal and the solid puddle looked somehow cleaner and more &quot;crystal-like&quot;.. Tasted a little bit nicer than the same ice smoked the old fashioned way in another clean pipe..<br />The quantity was pretty much the same after the water boiled out which makes me think I have pretty pure stuff. Can confirm this based on the actual effects of the ice anyway..<br /><br />But yea, curious to see if I did it right as I wasn&#039;t sure about your comment &quot;heat up untill smokes back.&quot;
