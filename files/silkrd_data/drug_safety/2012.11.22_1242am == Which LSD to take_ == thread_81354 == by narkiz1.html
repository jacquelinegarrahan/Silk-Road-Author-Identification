				Next weekend I shall be adventuring into my first acid trip! Basically I have ordered 1 of patterns (albions) LSD which are est. 100mcg, I have also ordered 2 of jor&#039;s lotus tabs, est. 65mcg each. I was just wondering what would be best to have for my first time, either just the 1 100mcg, 1 of the 65mcg (as I&#039;ve heard this ones are quite strong) or 2 of them. Would love to hear from anyone who has had any of these!

				I&#039;d take one of pattern&#039;s and save the other two to take together instead of mixing the two (which you will probabaly want to do if it&#039;s sitting there available lol)

				65 ug is quite a light dose. May well not produce more than a light buzz.<br />100 ug should produce a light trip. It is still a light dose though. <br /><br />I would take the 100ug - if after an hour and a half nothing much is happening I would throw in one JORs on top.<br /><br />Note though that if it is one of Albions shivas you have the dose is likely only about 65 ug even if they were sold at 100 ug. (Fartbomber lab tested his shivas at 63 ug and general consensus seems to be that the shivas are in this range). If so I would just take 2 of which ever or if you want to be careful 1Â½.<br /><br />
