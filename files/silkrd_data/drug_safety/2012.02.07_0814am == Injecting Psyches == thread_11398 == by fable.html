				So huh, this weekend a few of us were together all doing our drug of choice and my friend dared me to IV some of his 2c-t-2.&nbsp; I ended up taking 40 mg orally, IV&#039;ing 3 mg, an IM of 5mg, and then an IM of 3 MG.&nbsp; It was nice, really really nice.&nbsp; I like IM&#039;ing the most but am concerned about the safety of it.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the first 2C i&#039;ve IV&#039;d and IM&#039;d.... I may have actually liked 2C-C a little more.&nbsp; But.... this can&#039;t be much more unsafe than other drugs people shoot, huh?&nbsp; My injection sites look fine and my first IM (I did more the first time two because I split the last bit) is not sore.&nbsp; The second one is but I&#039;m sure it is because I did not apply pressure for long enough after I took the needle out.<br /><br /><br />Also... It has been over 32 hours and I&#039;m still getting visuals.&nbsp; A little concerned about that... it&#039;s not crippling, but I would like to return to normal so that tripping doesn&#039;t become my life so that I can actually enjoy it and not take it for granted.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this is HPPD or not.... my guess is that some of the 2c-t-2 is still in my muscle tissue and absorbing slowly.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				2Cs seem to create HPPD much more easily than any other drug, and in particular 2C-I. I had HPPD for about 3 weeks after a single 2C-I trip; when I went without smoking it lasted over 3 months (I had to quit smoking to get rid of it at all).<br /><br />Most people it doesn&#039;t last that long for, though. Ceasing drug use is the best way to get rid of the HPPD, though.
