				Tramadol is boring in my opinion.<br />You can though, try it no probs.<br />3pills should be enough, but just a friendly reminder, dont eat right after or right before you eat them

				Some people like trams and others don&#039;t. I quite like it but it feels a bit mechanical compared to other opiates/opioids. Don&#039;t go over 400mg because you&#039;ll be putting yourself at risk of seizure. 3 or 4 should do the trick for a first time.

				I thought Tramadol was pretty alright. In comparison to the other opiates, you don&#039;t get as high, but one of the positives is you really don&#039;t crash nearly as much (really, I don&#039;t think I ever crashed), in part because you don&#039;t get as high but also probably because of its anti-depressant effects. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re gonna feel much at the lower dosages others suggested, though. I personally would suggest exactly 5 pills. Maybe research it some more on Erowid, though.

				I find that I can&#039;t even feel it at less than 400mg or so, and then when I do, I don&#039;t like the feeling at all. It feels pretty different than other opiates. I used to have access to as many ampoules of tramadol for IM/IV as I wanted, and sometimes I&#039;d IV 300mg (or more; I have a very high tolerance), and even then, there wasn&#039;t much of a rush, and the &quot;rush&quot; I did get, I didn&#039;t like a whole lot.<br /><br />I only use it for real pain management. I find that 100mg of tramadol (oral) + 400mg of ibuprofen works very well for severe headaches I get. As far as recreation goes though, I even prefer codeine over tramadol. If you&#039;ve nothing better to do with it though, go ahead and take 100 - 150mg and see how it effects you. I think all opiates are worth trying at least once...

				Tramadol is a love or hate drug. Personally I love tramadol once in a while; I even took 600-1200mg a day for over a month on several occasions with no negative withdrawal effects, and in fact a brighter outlook/mood lift as someone else mentioned here. <br /><br />Tramadol is very different from classic opiates with its main downside being less euphoria, and that it causes anxiety in many people (including myself at high doses) because of its stimulant effects. I would say try it and see for yourself. I would start with 100mg or less just in case you really don&#039;t like the stimulant effects it has.<br /><br />If you have any opiate dependence, you will probably get 0 euphoria and pain relief because of the lower affinity to your opioid receptors. I wasn&#039;t taking any other opiates around the time I took tramadol.

				Tramadol is a tricky one because your response to it depends on which copy of a specific gene you have. Tramadol itself isn&#039;t particularly active against opioid receptors, but you have a liver enzyme (CYP2D6) that converts a portion of the dose to O-desmethyltramadol, which is very active against the u-opioid receptors. Some people have over- or under-active versions of this enzyme. For instance, my SO can get completely blissed out for 6-8 hours on 100mg, while it does fuck-all for me. Not fair really, but there you are. At least we don&#039;t fight over her supply.

I forgot to mention this. With all other opiates, I feel relaxed/sleepy while on them, but with tramadol, I don&#039;t feel relaxed, and I feel physically nervous. The best way I could describe it is the feeling you get when you&#039;ve had too much coffee

				Tramadol work well for me :P but comes with a high risk of seizure. created in the late 70&#039;s I would say it is virtually a RC.<br /><br />&quot;The analgesic action of tramadol is not fully understood, but it is believed to work through modulation of serotonin and norepinephrine in addition to its relatively-weak Î¼-opioid receptor agonism.&quot;<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol

				TRAMADOL is NOT an opiate. I was a heroin addict for four years, and before that I IV&#039;d oc&#039;s, and many other opiates. I am currently prescribed tramadol, and if you do any research you will find out that it is not an opiate. It is, however, mirrored after the opiate family, which is why 9 times out of 10 a doctor will not prescribe it to a former heroin addict. It can cause a very mild false sense of well being in some people, especially those with a low T-protein count in their liver. <br /><br />I was surprised at finding that people actually sold/bought it on here due to the fact that it is a NON NARCOTIC pain reliever. Do yourself a favor, if you want an opiate, and buy some oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine sulfate or IR, or just straight H.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Edit- <br />Also, the seizure risk is really one something you should be concerned with after taking it chronically for a substantial amount of time. Just like any other medicine, the more serious side effects are amplified after continuous use.

				Tramadol and Nucynta (a newer stronger version, supposedly inbetween tramadol and opiates in strength) are synthetic opiates plus an SNRI.<br /><br />They are for people who shouldn&#039;t be taking opiates (old people) or want to supress cravings - though in my experience it does an ok job if your not looking to get high. Most people I know take it because they can&#039;t find opiates - I think most people would agree it has no recreational potential.
