				Short answer: take ~5mg selegiline (aka deprenyl) before rolling, and take 5htp afterwards.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a couple good guides out there as to why mdma is neurotoxic - dancesafe in particular has a nice one for those with no knowledge of neurochemistry.

				as far as I know the neurotoxicity of moderate MDMA doses is still controversial. MDMA itself isn&#039;t neurotoxic but some of its metabolites are. And there are different metabolizing routes which makes it a bit complicated.<br /><br />Studies with rats, to which up to 40mg/kg MDMA was given i.v. daily for 14 days, didn&#039;t show any neurotoxicity (normal dose is 1.5mg/kg). I can look up what study that was, if somebody is interested. Other studies showed evidence for neurotoxicity, like serotonine depletion syndrome.<br /><br />What is certainly highly neurotoxic is the combination of MDMA with amphetamines/alcohol, so avoid these combos. 5htp combined with vitamine B6 before and afterwards is a good idea (vitamine B6 is the co-factor that is needed to convert 5htp to serotonine).

				5HTP, Magnesium and B6 Vitamine is what always was told to me. To be honest I havent done research into preventing neurotoxicity from MDMA and its hearsay but ive never had any problems with rolling when taking these things...

				To my understanding acute use of MDMA is not neurotoxic in physiological human doses (although I realize the range that people uses vaires). All evidence I&#039;ve seen that suggests neurotoxicity has been from in vitro studies or animals injected with extreme overdoses, and the human research I&#039;ve read on &#039;MDMA only&#039; users indicated no evidence of neurological deficit. Neurons are pretty resilient when they&#039;ve proper nutrition. <br />That said, there&#039;s no doubt that MDMA use (acute or chronic) can manifest adverse effects, especially after the desired subjective effects have worn off. Jaw clenching, headaches, &#039;brain fog&#039;, mild &#039;depression&#039;, et cetera. I rarely experience these but I understand it&#039;s pretty common in people who need to take larger amounts. <br />So I&#039;ve designed a nutritional supplement that prevents many of these negative effects, as well as &#039;real&#039; brain damage that could be caused by adulterants or drugs that are actually neurotoxic (i.e. injected). <br /><br />Ingredients are:<br />Magnesium Ascorbate (Vitamin C)<br />Grape Seed Extract (99% Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)<br />Pine Bark Extact (98% Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)<br />Ginkgo Biloba Extract (24% Ginkgolides)<br />Bio-Stabilized Sodium R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (Na-R-ALA)<br />Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)<br />Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (Vitamin B6)<br />5-HydroxyTryptophan (5-HTP)<br />N-Acetyl-Tyrosine (NALT)<br />Picamilon (GABA bound to Naicin [B3])<br />Sulbutiamine (Thiamine dimer [B1])<br />Bacopa Root Extract<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/5886<br /><br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to try it, vitamin C with flavonoids is a good place to start (try getting buffered C if you can, Magnesium is ideal). A little 5-HTP and some B6 (try for P5P) may also help, but make sure not to overdo either of those. Bacopa is good for protecting against a range of chemically-induced neurotoxicities, so you might want to try that too.

But really, this was a result of MDMA depleting your serotonin, and not as much MDMA causing neurotoxic damage. I know it&#039;s supposed to be a good idea to take antioxidants (like vitamin C and what-not), but as far as helping you feel less shitty after a roll, you should get your hands on some Vitamin B6 and 5htp. Both are readily available online or in health stores. Taking those supplements after a roll should help you restore your serotonin more quickly.

				I&#039;m surprised there hasn&#039;t been more than the couple posts here that mention antioxidants.<br /><br />ANTIOXIDANTS are the key, man. Take them before, during, and after your roll. The stimulation from MDMA catalyzes oxidation reactions in the brain. Oxidation reactions occur all the time from out daily bodily functions, which is why it&#039;s always a good idea to include antioxidant rich foods in your diet to prevent aging and degeneration. However, when taking MDMA, certain oxidation reactions create an abundance of free radical oxygen molecules that can wear down on your nerve endings. Antioxidants greatly reduce the possibility of this damage from free radicals.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I recommend:<br /><br />1-2 hours before your roll: -1,000mg of Vitamin C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 500-1,000mg of Alpha-Lipoic-Acid (ALA)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 400 IU of Vitamin E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A cup of green tea<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 300-600mg of CHELATED (citrate or malate are okay too) Magnesium (this is very important, do not buy elemenal magnesium or magnesium oxide because these forms have a worthlessly low absorption rate (something like 4% bioavailability). Magnesium helps with jaw clenching. Also test out 300-600mg of magnesium a few days before your roll, some people have gastrointestinal distress from magnesium in supplement form.<br /><br />2-4 hours into your roll:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 1,000mg of Vitamin C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 500-1,000mg of ALA<br /><br />Before bed:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 1,000mg of Vitamin C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 500-1,000mg of ALA<br /><br />The next day:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-1,000mg of Vitamin C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 500-1,000mg of Alpha-Lipoic-Acid (ALA)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 400 IU of Vitamin E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A cup of green tea<br /><br />The next 2-3 days:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - At least a regular inclusion of Vitamin C / ALA / Vitamin E in the diet and plenty <br /><br />of fruits. I&#039;ve also read pasta and potatoes accelerate serotonin production. As well, excercise is very, very good for regenerating and also, which has been scientifically proven countless times, SUNLIGHT! Spend as much time in the sun as possible, basking in the rays, this will greatly stimulate your serotonin production.<br /><br /><br />Vitamin C is only utilized for 2-4 hours because it is water soluble which is why it is a good idea to take is every few hours. Vitamin E is fat soluble and does not need to be replenished frequently, plus too much vitamin E is maybe not such a good thing. The neat thing about Vitamin C and Vitamin E together is the Vitamin E helps to recycle the Vitamin C. Once the Vitamin C has absorbed some of the free radical oxygen molecules, the Vitamin E absorbs some of what the Vitamin C has already absorbed, allowing the Vitamin C to continue to absorb more. They work well together. ALA is a very potent antioxidant and is a must have for rolling. Green Tea is full of polyphenols which are excellent antioxidants.<br /><br />The studies I&#039;ve read mention that much of the neurotoxicity associated with MDMA use occurs the day or 2 after the roll rather than during the roll itself, so be sure to continue a regimen of supplements for several days after the roll. It will help you feel better faster anyhow.<br />

				I agree with everything you posted, with one exception: the dose of ALA should be much lower, 100mg is plenty. Racemic (R/S)-ALA is less than half as active as enantiopure R-ALA, which is the biologically active form (S-ALA inhibits some effects of R-ALA and does not work as a cofactor). Freebase R-ALA is, in turn, many times less effective than stabilized Na-R-ALA, as it has a tendency to polymerize via intramolecular disulfide bonds, rendering the bulk of the dose unusable. <br />Vitamin E is similar, in that most vitamin E is dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, which is less than or equal to half as effective as D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, which is itself less bioavailable than d-alpha-tocopherol (the bioidentical forms), which is less effective than a mix of D-alpha, D-beta, D-gamma, and D-Delta tocopherols. The best would be vitamin E supplement which also contains d-Tocotrienols.

				In case you haven&#039;t seen it, there is an EPIC thread on MDMA neurotoxicity on our very own forums:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0 &quot;MDMA is neurotoxic. Here are some guidelines you should follow when rolling.&quot;<br /><br />The OP has a great list of resources and recommendations.

				I agree with Enterra&#039;s recommendations, too. with Tryp&#039;s caveats. I have seen compelling data on the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine as a preload as well. <br />

				Hi.<br /><br />Could someone suggest a good chelated magnesium I can buy in the UK? Scouting tinternet there are several brands, but I&#039;m not sure whats best. I&#039;ve been having real problems with my jaw when taking MDMA recently and I&#039;ve read this could help.<br /><br />Cheers.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have used the albion chelation method magnesium, and I still have problems if I take too high a dose, or lower-purity MDMA. I don&#039;t have a problem when taking a reasonable dose of the purest source.
