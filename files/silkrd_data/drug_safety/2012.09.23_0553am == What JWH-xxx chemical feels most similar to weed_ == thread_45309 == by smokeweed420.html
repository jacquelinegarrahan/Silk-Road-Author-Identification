				What Jwh-xxx or any other synthetic cannabanoid type chemical feels most like weed and how much should be infused per gram to make for a nice smoke but not so potent that its too intense. I get random UA&#039;s because i got a DUI and i really miss weed :(

				It&#039;s because you&#039;re asking a question that doesn&#039;t have an easy answer. Weed has many canaboids. So if you wanted to get as close as possible you would have to combine many chemicals. But, my favorites out the jwh series are 122, and 018. Am2201 was nice, but i felt like i was&nbsp; goin to seize up and got pretty strun out on it. I love ur -144 and they now have a new chem called 5fur-144. Also, are you wantin to make you&#039;re own blend. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a blend i tried reccently and enjoyed.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/a2a39486be<br /><br />That listin is a mild blend, but what i have noticed about 5fur-144 is the&nbsp; onset of the high is slow. So, take a hit and put it down for a momment and see where you&#039;re at&nbsp; also i think it would be a oogd&nbsp; blend to break you into synth. Also, get used to a lot of people giving you shit for using something that&#039;s not natural haha.

Over canachems i have had other than the 100&#039;s of different &quot;blends&quot; am-2201 was something that I could turn to if I wanted to be nocked on my ass to sleep. am-1248 was a easy light cana , mentally I wouldn&#039;t wonder off and physically didn&#039;t give red eyes, <br />Like that one poster said , it&#039;s a very hard question to answer but if you&#039;re trying to beat the system, heads up on any kind of false positive or redwood toxicology kind of shit that tests for analogs and rc&#039;s. Another piece of advice would be to not chase after the weed, you&#039;ll absolutely kill any kind of tolerance and enjoyment you have for bud.

If i had a local head shop selling, i dont think i would have quit so easily, the demons would have won!<br /><br />Now i take maybe 1-2 a month, and have no real urge to redose if i have a small chase.<br /><br />Treat with respect!
