				First a few notes:<br />-Listen to your body, test early. Know what your limits are. <br />-School is good, but staying alive is better. Keep stuff in focus. <br /><br />So quite frankly Adderall and such costs a ridiculous amount on here. I have no idea why and I dont really care. So here is my alternative. This is to keep focus, and avoid sleep. This is only for people who dont have learning difficulties that require scripts, but rather for those of us who simply need a few more hours of focus. <br /><br />1. I bought 2G of speed paste from MR.Importer here on the forums. A 5/5 transaction. Registered 1.98G on my scale. Close enough. Costs about $40. <br />2. Buy some Gel Caps. 0 size is overkill but whatever is handy. Cost me $9 for 150 units. <br />3. Take speed paste and put it on some tin foil. Put tin foil on very low heat on electric stove. <br />--Good way to gauge temp, is you should be able to touch the stove without burning yourself. Not keep your fingers there but a brief touch. <br />4. Every 5 minutes or so take it off heat (you should be able to hold tin with your bare hands) and use a small piece of plastic to chop it up. Maximize surface area. <br />5. After about 30 minutes most of the humidity is gone. (should be kind of like scaly flour sort of = hard to describe)<br />6. Get your scale. Each of my gel caps weighted .1G exactly. Measure an empty one of yours. <br />7. I know my tolerances so I put 40mg per cap. So the scale should read .14 full. <br />8. I got about 600MG of speed after baking. Was pretty disappointed by this, but I only need like 5 caps for finals week so its not an issue for me. <br /><br />Here are a few notes on usage:<br />-Take it in the morning. Pill is good for about 8 solid hours for me.<br />-Take it with food<br />-I got no shaking, no weird side effects, although I was kinda cold for a while. <br />-No side effects to notes. Took it at noon. Went to bed at 3AM, woke up at 9AM still feeling very fresh. <br />-Drink lots of water throughout the day. This will help flush you by the end of the day + water intake has a positive correlation with brain activity. <br /><br />So basically for $50 or so you can have about 10-15 40mg speed pills. Hope this helps.

				I find studying with a clear head just as effective as studying on something, even caffeine. It just helps things go in better in my opinion.<br /><br />Also I find that study aids either help you focus on the task that you&#039;re on or do more of the task you&#039;re on but they don&#039;t help you stay on task which I find the hardest bit about studying.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll pop some pills, sit down with some books then have a really intense shopping session on SR.<br /><br />So if you can find me anything that keeps me focused on the boring task in front of me rather than the fun thing that I could be doing I&#039;d love to know about it!

				Adderall works very well. If you can get it from a friend with ADHD it is far preferable to this.

				Amphetamine can be a great study aid in lower dosage (sub-recreatonal dosages). It will make it a lot easier to focus, prevent fatigue when studying for a long time, and one of its strongest preferences: it will keep your motivation to study up, way more than sober. But you should still not binge, as the longer you are up the less information will get stored in long term memory, after you slept, still take regular breaks, and study like you normal study, it is extremely important to repeat things to get them into your long term memory properly, even if being on amph makes you think you can remember everything just by reading it once.<br /><br />Taking it for exams can also be really helpful, it will take away a lot of stress and anxiety, and keep you focused. Too high dosages can make you drift of a lot, and be too speeded up (I&#039;m on a rather big amount of amph right now(~300mg pure amphetamine in the last 22 hours, with almost having no tolerance) and since about 5 hours i have a cigarette in front of me which is just keep forget to light and smoke....lol)

				I used to do 25mg of Addy and it was mediocre at best. I am a big guy with a high tolerance historically. 40mg works well for me.

				Another option is Modafinil. It&#039;s not amphetamine based so there&#039;s no high whatsoever but it&#039;s excellent for wakefulness and focus. It&#039;s also much cheaper than adderall on less easy to abuse. I can&#039;t tell you how much it&#039;s helped me. In the first fortnight I took it, I got more work done than I had in the previous three months combined.

				If you are looking to use dextro-levo-amphetamine as a study aid it needs to be absolutely pure.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend ordering BoyMaster&#039;s amphetamine silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bba430077a 96m%&lt; amphetamine (racemic mix)<br /><br />3-5mg is well enough if you are studying. Take it in the morning, go to work and whatever you do, do not redose. If you start redosing you are on the way to addiction. If you can, take the weekends off. If you start to see a pattern of craving for more, quit immediately. <br /><br />You will also need a precise scale able to weigh in milligrams. Don&#039;t buy cheap China scales, get a proper brand even though it costs a little more. Capsuling the amphetamine is a good idea also. So get some size 4 gelatin capsules online (they are really cheap).<br /><br />2 grams at the rate of 5 mg a day would last you a good four hundred days! (Cheaper than coffee! :))<br /><br />

				Adderall is a little more potent and effective than speed because it&#039;s 75% Dexamphetamine, and speed is only 50%.. If you want to do speed, I really recommend you only buy from boymaster or capecrusader though.
