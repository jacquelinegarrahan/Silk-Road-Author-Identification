				Just thought I would ask some of you what you guys think about the new OPs for future reference if I happen to run into em or want to try them out.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read from people that use it for actual pain it works and they definitely still get high off them.&nbsp; Though obviously doesn&#039;t hit them as hard but nevertheless it definitely works for a long time.<br /><br />I just like to speedball(snort only) with coke and heroin or oxycodone once in a while but I also do pop oxy&#039;s here and there by it self and enjoy it till I get a headache and start feeling nauseous which happens when the high is starting to wear off anyways.&nbsp; Roxicodone 30&#039;s tend to do that but heroin and oddly the old Opana&#039;s didn&#039;t get me sick at all either.&nbsp; I loved that stuff.<br /><br />Anyways as you can imagine I have little to no opiate tolerance and I would get pretty good with just 1 oxycodone 30 and probably could snort or smoke 100mg of good heroin throughout the day without feeling the sickness.<br /><br />I know you can microwave the OP&#039;s after grinding them up to snort but if I were to get just get OP 80&#039;s, cut it in half and chop one of the halves up as small as I can and then put it in a small cup of coke for few hours and drink that.&nbsp; You guys think I would get pretty messed up?<br /><br />I was thinking I could just eat a half of those and be good for the day while snorting some coke and be pretty much speedballing.&nbsp; Some sellers sell the 80&#039;s for pretty decent price mg to dollar ratio so just would like to be more aware of that particular product if I happen to want it.<br /><br /><br />sorry for the long ramble.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />TL;DR<br />little to no opiate tolerance<br />30mg oxycodone is good enough for me<br />would half of 80 OP eaten get me pretty high?

				Yes the soda method should work just fine i used to do it with op&#039;s and still do with MSCONTIN sometimes. Just cut it all up as small as possible, leave in a small amount of coke a cola for at least 12 hours more is better but under 24. Stir it a few times because the piceses will get stuck to whatever container your using so just use a spoon or something and get it all stirred up. Than all you have to do is slam it like a shot and make sure you get the leftover gel and eat it. It just makes it instant release for oral but works very well.

				yes, if i run out of h, to avoid withdrawals i will take oxyneos. smash em up, put them in coca cola for several hours, wait, wait, wait, wait, then drink. its no h but i dont withdrawal at all and feel pretty good. plus the oxyneos are dirty cheap compared to the oxycontin formula. if you dont mind waiting then its worth it. kicks in fast too

				Cool cool that&#039;s all I needed to know.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like I said I have little to no tolerance to any opiates so if it hits very fast after the soda technique, I&#039;m good to go.

				Man I hate those fucking Neos, I was soo bummed when they took the old formula away, I was lucky and bought a bunch of 80s but they didnt last long lol.<br /><br />I still bought them out of desperation and did the ole microwave/freezer trick and just to try and snort em, What a fuck around trying to do that bull shit, I laugh looking back at it now. I tried chewing em and never really felt shit. I just came to the conclusion if I cant snort em then they aint worth shit to me.<br /><br />you can imagine how happy I am now with these lovely generics :-),Im still in disbelief that they are back in snortable form :-) they feel soooo good after all this time. I wouldnt pay 1 penny for a fucking neo now. My advice to you is to get on the hunt for the generics.<br /><br />the two around here are made by Cobalt and APO, ive only had the cobalt ones (they say W40 or W80 on one side and Oxy CR on the other) and I love em. <br />You have to be careful thought cause I hear that one of the new generics stll gell up, I forget which company makes em but they have a P on the pill I believe (Pharamascience ??)<br /><br />just some info

				Thanks for the info.<br /><br />Sounds like you have a pretty high tolerance though.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure for someone like me I&#039;ll be feeling good enough even from a neo.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really trying to start another habit so I don&#039;t really go out of my way to look for any oxys.&nbsp; Just if they happen to pop up or I want some for speedballing. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;d rather get a couple stamps of heroin because where I live I get fat good quality stamps for real cheap and obviously they will wreck any oxycodone in terms of potency.&nbsp; Only thing that comes close is Opanas but neo Opana are too expensive and definitely not worth it especially since Opana orally is already shit.&nbsp; Use to snort the old ones.&nbsp; It used to get me so fucked up I would black out and act like a mad man.&nbsp; Man that shit was so potent and awesome haha.<br /><br />

				You can grind it up in to powder.&nbsp; Microwave it for 6-8(until it is golden brown) minutes on a glass plate then leave it in the freezer for 3-5 minutes so it cools down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take it out, move to a new dry plate or whatever, make lines and snort.<br /><br />Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t want to snort it anyways.&nbsp; Shit is like total plastic, don&#039;t need to damage my nose any more.&nbsp; Got the cocaine for that.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; There are actually some pretty good videos on youtube on the microwave or oven bake method and I saw one good video of a guy showing you how the pill mechanism works and how to break it down with coke and lemon juice.
