				Should the Drug Safety forum be divided into categories similar to the way bluelight.ru has specific forums for specific types of drugs?<br />I just think it&#039;d be easier for people with a question about a particular type of drug to find answers and people who are fairly experienced with that type of drug to provide answers. Information flows more smoothly when it&#039;s organized and focused. I think for the sake of simplicity we could even clump certain categories together like:<br /><br />Stimulants and Ecstasy<br />Opioids and Benzos<br />Psychedelics and Dissociatives<br />Cannabis

				hells yea<br /><br />I would like to see alcohol have its own category, if we are talking drug safety, since it the most widely available commonly used drug on the planet, and safety is a serious concern with it.&nbsp; Perhaps just one extra miscellaneous category would cover Alcohol and discussion about more obscure substances.

				Yeah, I third the motion. It would be much better to be streamlined to go exactly where you want from the beginning. <br />Shouldn&#039;t this post be in the &#039;Feature Request&#039; forum? Or is this just to get a feel for what people think?

				Perhaps, it should be, but i don&#039;t think it should be by drug type per se. <br /><br />I see a lot of questions about using normal dosages of substances like benzo&#039;s here, as well as topics about taking ridiculous amounts of them and often combined with something else. <br /><br />I would suggest splitting the drug safety board into &#039;as clinically indicated&#039; and &#039;experimental doses and substances&#039; - you can make up a nicer name for either. This would at least give some clarity between what are common side effects and risks of drugs that are also dispensed by doctors versus illicit drugs and substance combinations generally recommended against.

				That&#039;s way more complicated Ben.&nbsp; Speaking from experience on other drug forums, basic categorization of substances, with similar enough substances grouped together, is the best way to go just as the thread starter suggested.

				Largely because I think every substance is sooo unique. Can you please name the similarities between benzos and LSD? Know what I&#039;m sayin? Focusing the conversation initially on specific substance is good and than a thread can bring up whatever specific topic about that drug that the person wants.

If someone wanted to know about, for example, using a benzo to end a bad trip caused by lsd, should that be in the hallucinogen section, or in the benzo section?<br /><br />Many posts here deal with combinations of substances that would fall in different categories in the suggested list. This is why i would prefer a split in &#039;simple drug use&#039; and &#039;complex/experimental use&#039;, the latter dealing with combinations of substances and perhaps idiotically large doses of a single substance as well.<br /><br />My reasoning is that people are likely to want to read about what will happen to them when they take a tablet of valium, xtc (or two), separated from the question of what will happen to you if you took all kinds of drugs in one session and downed them with a glass of vodka. In either classification system there will be overlap, but i think that splitting it by substance would somehow require topics to be visible in two or more boards - i&#039;m not sure if that is technically feasible using the forum software - i&#039;m presuming it is not.

				I definitely think there should be. That way there can be stickies in each category that has common questions or whatever else in necessary. Plus it would be nice having a customized community for say, Psychedelics, and then other sub forums for Opioids.

				In my opinion this forum isn&#039;t active enough to have that many separate categories. No need.

				I thought about this for a little bit. at first it seemed like a great idea.&nbsp; Then another thought occurred to me. There are some people that know a lot about a variety of drugs that look through this drug safety category, if you put in sub categories they might not check all the categories they normally would be able to see entries from and not be able to give advice or help someone if they weren&#039;t intentionally going into that category..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of i explained that clearly.&nbsp; anyways if not hopefully i&#039;ll come back and fix it. :P

				Its true that cause SR is underground the traffic on here is not much compared to most any other drug forum on the regular web so it might not be needed, but I still like the idea, especially to have stickies for certain substances like someone mentioned, that is a great way to provide basic reliable info on specific substances for everyone to check out.
