				Hello, I am new to using rc&#039;s and was wondering the differences in some. I have searched online but figured it would be best to hear from some people with experience. Now i&#039;m trying to find something visually pleasing. I have taken some psychedelics before such as acid and shrooms. I&#039;ve also taken dxm a pretty good bit. I&#039;m wondering what Rc&#039;s are the best for visual aspects? Which Rc&#039;s are best for what? Like what are the differences in all the 2-cs and what not. Any info would be appreciated. Also how large of a dose should I take. I&#039;m male and weigh about 220 lbs

				2C-P, 4-AcO-DMT, or 25i-NBOMe.

				25i-NBOMe for sure would be a good one.<br />I&#039;ve never taken 4-AcO-DMT but it&#039;s related to psilocin, right? So it&#039;s got to be a good chemical.<br />Also I&#039;ve never experienced 2C-P but from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s a fairly intense chemical. You should experiment with other 2C&#039;s before moving to 2C-P. I can personally recommend 2C-E, I, and B.<br />Also since you like DXM you could try methoxetamine.

				4-AcO-DMT is like a more pleasant shroom trip, but replacing the nausea for gas.It&#039;s worth a shot. MXE is supposed to be great if you&#039;re into dissociatives. I&#039;ve never tried the 2c series, but from what I hear 2c-b and 2c-e are the best &quot;first 2c&#039;s&quot; around.

				why not go with a natural psychedelic rather than an unknown research chem...<br /><br />you should try mescaline (a phenethylamine), it produces some lovely color enhancement, patterning, and really weird effects that is honestly different than most else I have experienced. like one side of the room expanding while the other side shrunk, rather than everything I saw just morphing and blending. <br /><br />If you want straight up intense visuals and dont have a day to kill, yet another NATURAL molecule you could consume is dimethyl-tryptamine. After smoking a large hit you are blasted out of a cosmic canon into an alien world of vivid and unique imagery. Which lasts only 10-15 minutes and then a return to baseline within an hour. Certainly one worth experiencing.<br /><br />Both you can extract yourself, which is extremely rewarding and the trip takes on a special feeling (like oh shit I messed up and I ingested a poison&nbsp; :P )<br /><br />Refer to erowid and bluelight for dosing suggestions and reports on subjective effects <br /><br />For synthetics, I too am interested in trying a few of the RCs though, especially an NBOME and 4-aco-dmt. The 2c series is worth an experience, yet I did moderate doses and felt more like I was rolling with very minor visuals.

				I seem to be in the minority but I HATED 4-aco-dmt. I love some MXE though, and I think most people would too. It&#039;s not as much of a trip unless you get into higher doses.
