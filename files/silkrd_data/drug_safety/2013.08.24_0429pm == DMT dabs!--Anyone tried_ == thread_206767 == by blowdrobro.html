				Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone has tried to do some DMT dabs on an oil rig. I was thinking of getting a decent glob and rolling it in 35-50mgs of DMT. What do you guys think?

				If I were to do this, I would get a dome and nail just for the DMT.<br />And I also would just dab the DMT and not any wax. <br />That&#039;s just me tho.

				That would be insane! A friend of mine once told me that if I could dab .2 in a dab i could handle a huge dose of boomers. He is very into psychedelics but had never smoked any wax before I gave him a present. But holy shit DMT on top of the rush from the glob would be intense.&nbsp;

				I will report back my experince. I&#039;m gonna order enough for a few trips this time so I can really play around with different methods. Gotta say, so far the volcano is by far the best for me. 50mg ontop of some vaped bud is instant hyperspace for me.

				Well i will share my experience with you OP but i will make it as short as possible ( my english is not so good for a detailed report :P )<br />I tried this with an method i read about on nexus ( if you want the method i can pm you with the link )<br />I blended some dmt with some weed through that method , i made an normal joint and as usual i put some chillout music and find a good spot to sit.I lit it and started to smoke , it wasn&#039;t harsh at all , in fact it had such a nice taste that i couldn&#039;t stop smoking it ^_^. After the first puffs i started to feel the effects build up , slowly, not as fast as you normally feel when smoking with a pipe.After half the joint i was already having strong CEV&#039;s ( open eyes and also closed eyes ) and some sound distortion.But i wanted to try and breakthrough so i kept smoking it , but after 3/4 of it i couldn&#039;t continue , i put the joint in the ash can and enjoyed the trip that lasted for about 25 mins.<br />The awesome part of smoking it like this is that you can stop whenever you feel it&#039;s too much for you and also when you feel that the effects are starting to diminish you can lit it again , take a few puffs and go back to hyperspace i a matter of seconds.<br />Oh , forgot to say this , i used 0.4 ak47 weed with an 0.18 dmt ( also lots of leftovers from the bag i had my weed on ).<br />Again , sorry for my bad english but i hope this helped you and everyone else at least a little bit.If i forgot to say something or you don&#039;t understand anything , don&#039;t hesitate to ask me .<br />Be safe man and have a nice life.<br />Cheers
