				so i bought a gram of yellowish speed and tonight me and a friend tried it out, each of us would have had 20 cones earlier during the night and i had a rock of yellow goodness with me.<br />i started by putting some of it on top of my cone and smoking it in a bong, wasnt really sure if it would even work like that so we only did a little that way.<br />then we pretty much ate the rest of what i brought ~400mg. didnt taste too bad either compared to mdma..<br />and it was probably split 250mg for me and 150mg for him, and it was hard to tell cause my scales are only 0.00<br />so what i really wanted to ask was have i overdosed? because im feeling good now still, like no nasty side effects(Y) except maybe not being tired..

I guess if you&#039;re not dead, yet, then the answer is no. If in doubt, check your vital signs - if none found, then yes, I&#039;m afraid your dead &amp; we hope you enjoyed your ride&nbsp; &amp; only one per customer.<br /><br />No, really, seriously...it&#039;s a bit hard to give medical OPINIONS online just by what you took, without giving any physical details, even. What may feel good to a 200 pounder may kill a 125...not to mention you never mentioned an accelerated or decreased heart rate, respiration, or if you&#039;ve completely lost all control of your bowels and crapped all over your speed partner. Crapping or projectile vomiting on your trip buddy is considered in bad taste, no matter the occasion.<br /><br />Plus, giving medical opinions online is impossible to do - SR isn&#039;t there with you. If you think you may have OD then 911 can do a lot more to help than SR. If you currently have no vitals, disregard this reply&nbsp; ;D

				What the fuck is this thread? What did you do exactly, Meth or what? I would assume you will be fine, but then again I don&#039;t really know what drug you did, do you? Do you have amphetamine experience?<br /><br />What makes you ask if you have overdosed? That&#039;s not something to just ask casually dude, what the fuck? I&#039;m confused how you get from &#039;a lovely experience&#039; to &#039;did I overdose?&#039;
