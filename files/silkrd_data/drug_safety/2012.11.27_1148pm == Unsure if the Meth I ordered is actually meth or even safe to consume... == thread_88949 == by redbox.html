				I would order a test kit from the road or from Dance Safe/Bunk police it should allow you to test to see what substance you have. I received MDMA that smelled like vinegar once and tested that shit before I let anyone try it because it seemed super weird.

				There have got to be 5+ threads dedicated to DarkMoon being a selective scammer and the like. Wouldn&#039;t doubt it, ridiculously low prices and always requires FE. There are sooo many meth replacement drugs too it&#039;s ridiculous MPA MDPV Pentedrone so be careful out there

				Here is what you can do since you dont have reagents. Get a peice of aluminum foil and put some of the powder on it. Than get a lighter and slowly light under the substance. if its methamphetamine it will melt down into a liquid and run. after it cools down it will re-crystalize. if it doesn&#039;t do this than it is not meth.

				If you want the real deal, buy from &quot;hammertime&quot;, his shit is legit ice shards, best of the road according to many (including me).

				Since you got powder I can&#039;t say for sure if its a bathsalt or cut with bathsalt or whatever but this shit has been making its rounds again unfortunately from what some people have gotten from a few vendors, Its bad bro will give you horrible headaches and no high, like i said i can&#039;t be sure its what you got but its something to be aware of since it has been sent to a number of people here recently.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropylbenzylamine (this will tell you more about it)

Not sure why you ended up with a flattened package those are meant for international orders.<br />If you feel better with some shards send me your address and I will get you out some crystals as clear as glass.<br />I will be taking some pictures and putting them up since I am finally caught up.<br /><br />&nbsp;Peace!

				Seems pretty strange/suspicious that there hasn&#039;t been an update in this thread since DM showed up.<br /><br />Did the OP get bribed to ensure silence?

				It was me that never got back to him.&nbsp; I still have his original shipment here, unopened still.&nbsp; Just been trying to kick the habit (successfully so far) lol... maybe I won&#039;t need anymore afterall, or to open his package.<br /><br />Why I&#039;m keeping it?&nbsp; I&nbsp; don&#039;t know, just feels like a layer of security.&nbsp; What&#039;s the harm if I don&#039;t touch it?&nbsp; And if I do, oh well right?<br /><br />Also, looks like he got banned again from SR, so even if I did respond to him, seems like it may be all for nothing, but I would still give him the benefit of the doubt like I always have should I have really wanted it made right.
