				..diarrhea<br /><br />I took 1x 120ug blotter of aakovens the other day (should note here this is the first time I am taking LSD), after 1 hour and not feeling any different I took another I had, still nothing. I kept them under my tongue for 15 minutes and they tasted bitter and awful, then I chewed them up and swallowed them.<br /><br />But yeah, nothing, do any other drugs interferer with LSD and stop it working or anything?<br /><br />A couple days later I tried again, this time I dropped TWO 1x 120ug tabs and did the same sublingual thing, and still nothing.. aakoven being the boss he is is sending me a couple more but I don&#039;t want the same thing to happen again, what the heck am I doing wrong? <br /><br />And the mushroom thing, what&#039;s that about? Everytime I take shrooms it&#039;s like a laxative for me.

				Are you taking any prescription medicine?<br /><br />All (as far as I know all of them anyways) SSRI&#039;s and SNRI&#039;s will kill your ability to trip, it&#039;s a damned shame, but pick your poisons I guess.

				Well, to answer your mushroom question.&nbsp; You have whats called the cosmic shits which can happen on both lsd and mushrooms. For me it always happens that I have to take a monster shit on the comeup when the visuals first start to peak.&nbsp; Its the bodys automatic response because it thinks it is poisoned.&nbsp; On shrooms you will notice you are like in a dream state where you are constantly yawning and tearing and you have to piss like a horse and shit, or for some people they wanna vomit as well.&nbsp; All those bodily responses are just the body trying to get rid of whatever you put in it thats causing your body toxicity.&nbsp; One of the reasons why i prefer lsd over shrooms is I have personally have no nausea and the visuals are so much more beautiful and i am one with myself.&nbsp; For your second question as to what you might be doing wrong that u aint tripping.&nbsp; I found out a long time ago that for me, if im on a benzo then all i get from lsd or mushrooms is heightened vision and music sounds deep but nothing visual at all.&nbsp; Once i stopped taking the benzos for a week i was able to trip balls.&nbsp; Also a long time ago i was abusing opiates and became addicted.&nbsp; To get over my addiction I went to get help and was prescribed Suboxone which was buprephorine and naloxone combo.&nbsp; While taking this drug i realized that everytime my lsd trip was pretty much diminished.&nbsp; I would take the suboxone the night before and even though i didnt take any in the morning i would barely trip, all i would get was music sounded really good but nothing visual.&nbsp; According to my doctor i had to stay on this drug for another year before i could wean myself off.&nbsp; At this point i had to mjake a serious decision. LSD OR SUBOXONE? I went cold turkey on the suboxone and went through crazy cold sweats and neausea and vomitting and pain for a week.&nbsp; I got over my opiate addiction and stopped taking suboxone on my own just to take acid again lmao haha.&nbsp; Anyway, if you are on suboxone or subutex or any kind of drug that suppose to help you get over an opiate addiction like methadone, or even if you take opiate drugs like oxy, or hydros, these will seriously stop any acid from working the right way.&nbsp;

				sounds like it might be the benzos? I don&#039;t take very many though, but I didn&#039;t get any visuals at all after taking them, I can&#039;t remember listening to music or feeling any different. I suppose I can not take benzos for a week and see what happens.

				they taste bitter and awful?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />could have been degraded by improper storage/shipping, but it sounds like that&#039;s not the real problem...<br /><br />and lol @ &quot;cosmic shits&quot;
