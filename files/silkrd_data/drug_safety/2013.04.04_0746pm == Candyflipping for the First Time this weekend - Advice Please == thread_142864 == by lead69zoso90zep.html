				Hey guys!<br /><br />This upcoming weekend, I plan on Candyflipping for the first time at a rave which is a first for me as well. I&#039;ve done MDMA several different times before and haven&#039;t taken it in 2 months preparing for this rave. I&#039;ve done LSD twice, the first time I took 2 hits (listed at 150 ug) and it was the best trip ever but the second time, I took 3 hits (listed at 200 ug) and barely felt anything. I am planning on taking 200 mg of MDMA (SuperTrips) and 2 and 1/2 hits of LSD (Juergen2001 300 ug). Is this too much to take for my first candyflip at my first rave? Any and all advice is welcome. :)<br /><br />Thanks guys!

If you need some time to yourself that isn&#039;t going to happen at a rave; it&#039;d be pretty disastrous if you had a bad trip. Granted, the MDMA will alleviate some of that.<br /><br />Be careful!

				Candyflipping is absolutely beautiful and one of the most synergistic combinations you can partake in. I have combined many substances with varying time increments (I’m OCD when it comes to a timing schedule), and have found that taking 1.5mg/Kg of MDMA at precisely T+2:00 to offer for the best results. In doing so, the LSD will have nearly (if not fully) manifested itself and will guide your MDMA peak so that they both align beautifully. I’ve stressed it before and I’ll stress it again: they key to a successful candyflip is TIMING. Why? Because you want your trip and roll to end at about the same time. Check out the erowid effects graphs yourself and you&#039;ll find that the 2 hour mark to be optimal.<br /><br />Another thing you need to be wary of is not dosing too much MDMA or it might overpower the LSD. MDMA is meant to add a euphoric and positive undertone to the trip and enhance tactile and musical appreciation even further, so don’t go balls to the walls with your MDMA dose. The combination is incredibly gentle, and any worries, anxieties, or ill thoughts you think you may have will completely vanish once you finally realize just how beautiful the candyflip world is. LSD and MDMA are, in my experience, the two most synergistic substances out there. They complement each other amazingly well and the odds for a bad candyflip are close to nil.

				I feel compelled to respond because my first candyflip was last weekend. :) <br /><br />That said, this obviously means limited experience, but my $.02:<br /><br />I completely understand the desire to not want to under-dose the LSD - I infer that you realize you can&#039;t enhance the fx by re-dosing the acid which is correct - it would only lengthen the trip. Whether 300ug is too much for you or for the setting is entirely dependent, I think, on what you&#039;re used to.<br /><br />My candyflip was a T-0 dose of 270ug LSD combined with 2.5g dried, whole shrooms, MDMA (pill - maybe 120mg) at T+2.5 hours, 4 or 5 volcano bags of mj at T+4, and another 90ug acid and 2.3g shrooms at T+9 to extend the trip. This was totally manageable (and, in fact, made for a super level-headed, lucid trip - I think I needed more MDMA). If you&#039;re used to 300ug acid trips, I wouldn&#039;t sweat it for your candyflip notwithstanding the crowd. And that&#039;s bound to be a more social mix than an LSD/shroom base. If that&#039;s a normal dose for you, I think you&#039;ll be fine.

				I just did my first candyflip a few weeks ago. It&#039;s an awesome combination, but remember there can be significant synergy. I dosed 300ug of LSD and took 160mg of MDMA at T+3.5hrs and I was tripping my fucking face off. The headspace with MDMA is very warm and easygoing, but I was not functional for about two hours as I peaked on both. The funny thing was that I was very clear headed, could work a remote okay, just too melty to walk.<br /><br />The MDMA also extended my trip well beyond what I would have expected. I dropped the acid at 1PM, MDMA at 4:30PM (later than I&#039;d planned) and I was tripping until around 2AM. I was still at maybe a +1 when I fell asleep, but not enough of a show to stay up for.
