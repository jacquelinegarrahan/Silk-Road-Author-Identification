				i used meth for the first time yesterday and it wasn&#039;t so strong. i did about 2 points in 1 hour and it felt like cocaine gives me a strong euphoric feeling.. had my comedown about 8 hours later.<br /><br />lately ive been low on libido and havent really had the ability or desire to get an erection for sometimes weeks on end and im in my mid 30&#039;s. I did notice a few months back that after taking lexapro (stopped that for over a month now) that the VERY FIRST DAY i had a lexapro that i got full morning erections and constantly need to masturbate and had lots of daytime erections.. something with the lexapro restored my libido.. any ideas on that?<br /><br />now that ive stopped lexapro my libido has gone back to absolutley nothing and im not getting erections even when going weeks without it.. the last time i had an ejeaculation before yesterdays incident was about a month ago and the look of the semen was totally fine.<br /><br /><br />but yesterday i did meth for the first time and about 5 hours before the beat off session i had ghb and had been using amyl nitrites the whole time. Im new to the ghb as well so it was my first orgasm on ghb even though the effects wore off hours before this.<br /><br /><br />but anyway i finally got an erection.. first time in a whole month and with a semi flaccid penis i had an orgasm but it felt like one of those ssri disfunctional type orgasms and all that come out was about 10 drops of watery droplets.. no thickness.. all watery and clear.<br /><br /><br />does meth cause this effect of a funny orgasm and strange sperm cos i cant find much on it.<br /><br />im going to the doctor tomrrow and ill tell him about it but i dont want to mention meth, nor the fact i stopped the ssri&#039;s. i&#039;ll be gettign a new doctor soon as he&#039;s the type of doctor that puts you on random ssri&#039;s or antiphyschotics whever you appear regardless of whether you say it works well it not.<br /><br /><br />i was thinking of having a beat off tonight and seeing if its back to normal.<br /><br /><br />so.. <br /><br />1.) can meth cause this fucked up situtaion with the sperm coming out like water droplets when you were epxecting torrents of the usual?<br />2.) what do you think might be happening brain chemical wise that i take an ssri like lexapro (or luvox as this happened previously last year) and i instantly get restored sexual libidio and morning erections after the first pill and continued sexual arousal instead of the typical poor sexual function side effect (which used to be the case a few years ago)???<br /><br /><br />

				Lol, its called an orgasm brother.&nbsp; Not the same as playing with yourself and the gooey white coming out.&nbsp; Happens on meth due the to prolonged stimulation period, or after long sex sessions without meth in my case.
