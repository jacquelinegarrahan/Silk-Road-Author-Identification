				about 6 months ago i tried 25i for my first psychedelic experience. I did it in a major mall and it was the best/worst thing i chose to do in my life. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking to try LSD &amp; was wondering if there are any similarities with 25i? What would be an ideal place to allow for the best trip?

				Ideal place for you first L experience, would indefinitely be in a place you are safe, secure, and around people you trust with your life. Preferably indoors, at least until the overwhelming urge to be outside over comes you. good luck friend.&nbsp;

				Haven&#039;t personally taken it, but I&#039;ve heard many people saying that 25i is more of a push than LSD, and that LSD is more lucid and controllable.

Every single psychedelic can blow your mind. And if your mind IS blown, well then there is only little (if any) control left. Know your dose and respect psychs. <br /><br />For the first time I would recommend to take it inside in a safe environment with a close friend. Perfect if this friend knows what to do as a sitter. <br /><br />Have fun and dont overdo it!<br /><br />take care<br />12345&nbsp;

				Yeah do it at home or in some other place where you will feel safe. It is entirely possible on a medium strong dose of LSD to get into in a state where it will be obvious to people that you are under influence and if they start getting hostile it can make a trip go really bad.<br /><br />Well after the peak (like 6-7 hours into the trip) going out amongst people usually gets manageable.

				do it at home. <br />Drop it at Saturday night in your room around 20:00. come up is 30-60 minutes. your gonna be up all night. Just close your eyes relax and put on some good music. only do one tab first to get the feeling of it. next week you can try 2 for a more colorful experience. <br />Enjoy.

				i took a 2 mg dose of 25i, had a horrible time. just felt like a cheap lsd knockoff to me. also felt very hard on the brain. there are a few similarities, but lsd has a certain magic to it... 25i just feels very &quot;plastic&quot; to me. an ideal location for a trip is anywhere you feel comfortable, preferably close to nature.

				Out in nature with people you get along with is always good. If it gets heavy do some sun salutations. It will bring you back. Heck do them if your having fun! Yoga can really elevate the trip. Music is good too, live if the scene is cool nice people. Back in the day we used to get sheets on tour for $50. Now its like $10 a hit. Crazy how the NBOME has taken over. Get it from someone who has 100%+ LSD review. I hear JOR has great stuff and PPLLUURR relays his stuff domestic USA. I love L but I haven&#039;t done it in years. If my bitcoins left in my account grow to $10 I my have to spring for a JOR tab.
