				I am going to a festival this weekend and I was planning to to bring some mushrooms, lsd, mda and more lsd. And consume in this order but I recently purchased some 2cb to try for the first time and was thinking of throwing that in the mix as well or to replace my mushrooms.&nbsp; Does anybody have any experience with 2cb having a cross tolerance with lsd or mda?

				I&#039;m not certain but I think 2c-b binds to a different receptor to LSD... So I wouldn&#039;t have thought there&#039;s a cross tolerance. Could be wrong... But I remember reading it somewhere on these forums.

				&#039;Unlike most hallucinogens, 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy serotonin 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist[8] or even full antagonist&#039; from Wikipedia.

				No worries man. I was planning on finding out for myself anyway but I figured if someone on here says taking the 2cb the day before lsd will greatly diminish the lsd experience then maybe I would reconsider the 2cb for a later time.&nbsp; Always nice when your problems have to do with how to best consume all the drugs I have. lol

Yeah, you&#039;re not the only one! I always try&nbsp; to get the most from my drugs - I pay for them, why not?&nbsp; :D
