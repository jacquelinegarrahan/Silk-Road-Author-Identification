				I am not sure if this is the correct thread group for what I am looking for.&nbsp; I am specifically looking to find the following information for MDMA trip. But I think it can be a separate thread group by itself where we can have similar information information (in the similar format) for other drugs as well.<br /><br />So, here is the format. Please help me to have a smooth and enjoyable drive on the MDMA road.<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Dietary Preparation : Empty stomach, or X hours after food; any food not to take, etc<br />2. Water Intake : Whether to drink water or other drinks (mention specific drink you take; alcohol, soft drinks, etc) before, during and after the trip<br />3. Dose Amount : Initial dose amount<br />4. Supplemental Dose Amount and Frequency : How much to re-dose and how often<br />5. Set and Settings : Ambience that might enhance the effect<br />6. Kick in Time : How long it takes to feel the effect<br />7. Your Trip Experience : A brief about your trip would be helpful, I guess (Do not want the whole erowid thing here!!!)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SM

				I am no expert on MDMA, but I&#039;ll chip in with what I think is preferable<br /><br />1. Dietary Preparation : An empty stomach will provide a quicker onset, but you want to supplement your body with enough vitamins, minerals etc. prior to the trip so I&#039;d prefer to eat before taking it. Also, it will suppress your appetite during the trip.<br />2. Water Intake : Plain or mineral water is the best option IMO. Sugars in sodas will only cause further dehydration. Alcohol can be very dangerous. Make sure to drink plenty, but don&#039;t overdo it. Overhydration is very dangerous as well.<br />3. Dose Amount : Depends on experience, body weight, brain chemistry etc. Don&#039;t make the same mistake as I did with my first trip. It may end up a disaster. START SMALL!! <br />4. Supplemental Dose Amount and Frequency : the same as point #3<br />5. Set and Settings : If taken in the right amount for you, MDMA should blow your mind no matter where you are ;D<br />6. Kick in Time : Depends on stomach content, brain chemistry etc. Estimated come-up - 30 minutes<br />7. Your Trip Experience : Only had 1 experience so far which ended up very badly. Turned out I am very sensitive to MDMA and had some sort of an allergic reaction and ended up half-dead (metaphorically) for 12 hours, feeling like shit. I took 150mg which is a rather big dose for a first-time user.

				I&#039;m no expert either, so please remember that results may vary.<br /><br />1. Dietary Preparation : Depends on how you take it. If you eat soon before taking MDMA orally, it&#039;ll spend a lot of time in your stomach and you&#039;ll lose some because of its long swim in acid. Personally I prefer to classier booty-pump. It hits quicker (5-10 minutes), gives a less depressing comedown later, and you get better absorbtion. It also allows you to have had a decent meal beforehand (keep those energy levels up).<br />2. Water Intake : Water&#039;s always a clear winner, but I also throw in sports drinks and the occassional Redbull. You have to be very careful though, MDMA affects your body&#039;s ability to gauge its actual need for hydration. Think about how much you&#039;re drinking, how much activity you&#039;re engaged in, and what the temperature&#039;s like. Don&#039;t just drink however much feels right. Also, I prefer not mixing MDMA with alcohol (except for the occassional help with the comedown).<br />3. Dose Amount : Depends on your experience, body type, method of administration. As Alanko said, start small.<br />4. Supplemental Dose Amount and Frequency : I try to take only one big hit. Anything after that just feels like a waste. Better just to wait until the next party in two weeks.<br />5. Set and Settings : Depends on your personal high. I prefer clubbing with a few close friends who are also tripping. That way I can have fun dancing and get in the close, loving vibes. I wouldn&#039;t ever want to be the only one on it. Doing it with a partner is also great. Go dancing for a bit, then race home (in a taxi) and get sexy. As Trailer said, try not to overthink the experience, just sit back, relax, and enjoy feeling amazing.<br />6. Kick in Time : Orally - around 45 minutes. Bootily - around 10 minutes.<br />7. Your Trip Experience : Erowid is a great resource, I&#039;d recommend giving it a try ( https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDMA.shtml ). Do it through Tor and clear your browsing history if you&#039;re feeling paranoid for some reason.

				1. Eat 2-3 hours beforehand, not a massive amount but decent meal. It will indeed hit quicker with less in your stomach.<br />2. Hydration is very important! You will move around and sweat a fair bit most likely. Can&#039;t give an exact amount, but keep water nearby and sip away at it often, have a litre or two throughout the trip.<br />3. Yep starting small is best. I have 160&#039;s and started with a half, but I can get a pretty decent time on a quarter as well.<br />4. After your first experience, you will see. If you are happy with your trip, not much point going higher next time as the more you take the worse you feel the next day. Around 150mg seems like standard pills for experienced users.<br />5. Going clubbing is popular, need to be much more aware of hydration then. You will get lots of feelings of closeness as well so be in good company with people you really like/love. Your music tastes will probably change, try to get some fast paced or dance music ready.<br />6. 5-10 minutes for me I can start feeling it, then 30 mins or so to really kick in. Also be aware that its a &#039;wave&#039; drug; you will peak and come down several times.<br />7. Overwhelming desire to dance or at least jump around like a retard, I also smoke weed with it which makes for quite a psychedelic trip, but only sativa. Indica will mess with your head as your body gets couchlocked but also &#039;needs&#039; to move. Overall good fun, and somewhat draining.<br /><br />@monday.123; what do you mean by booty-pump?

				suggest reading up on all the what if&#039;s and most info around it too beforehand if u havent already, justincase. Hopefully you already know about possible dangerous drug-interactions with mdma.. <br />bluelight.ru and drugs-forum.com are great sources with numerous posts on everything around mdma usage where mostly every possible question should have been answered already.<br />for example this post seems to have some useful info on the most common problems (hyperthermia &amp; hyponatremia), nothing thatll be needed hopefully, but could be good to know for self or others if for nothing else to know more about the drug and how it works<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/604472-What-to-do-in-case-of-an-MDMA-overdose<br />re-dosing and also big doses seems to increase neurotoxicity by alot compared to normal/standard dose.. so prolly better not re-dose, atleast not more than a little and just once.&nbsp; any more is pretty much a waste and wont give much stronger/longer effect anyway.<br /><br />think I remember reading something like that high doses of antioxidants (like vitamin c) administered to labrats before/during MDMA use prevented completely or lowered by alot, the neurotoxicity of the drug. Personally I always pre-load with magnesium and vitamin c aswell as drinking juice and/or forcing down atleast a little fruit during the roll- good for replacing electrolytes n minerals ure losing too, and magnesium for jawclenching/muscle/nervous system stuff should help with sleep afterwards anyway.. cant hurt I think. Vit c has diuretic effect tho but prolly not too bad..&nbsp; some omega-3 -rich fat fish, nuts, vegetables and other healthy foods (fishoil supplement may be easy n beneficial if u dont get it thru food) may be good for ur brain in different ways too, consider eating healthy like that beforehand to add another layer of healthyness, can only be good anyway I think;)<br />afterwards (and before?) eat stuff like tuna,meat,milk .. too, with tryptophan (precursor to serotonin i think?), and such to build up that serotonin and possibly decrease comedown<br /><br />Also THC appearently prevents neurotoxicity in mice with mdma-use. Many ppl already like smoking on the comedown so it wouldnt hurt to have a joint in the end before sleep I guess=P <br />- http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009143<br />personally Id reccomend not smoking during roll tho, I think it messes with my thinking too much. . . <br /><br /><br />Also keeping cool is supposed to be good and will decrease the possible bad sides, both cos it lowers neurotoxic damage, and also all treatment of mdma-induced problems and overdoses includes cooling..&nbsp; many get issues as they get too hot without noticing. so stay cool/in low temperature !<br /><br />and expect a good time, have fun =D<br />
