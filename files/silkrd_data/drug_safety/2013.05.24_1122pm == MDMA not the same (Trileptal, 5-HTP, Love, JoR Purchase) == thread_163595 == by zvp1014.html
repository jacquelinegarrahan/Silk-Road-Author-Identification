				Hi!<br /><br />I&#039;m currently rolling, or rather, attempting to roll, on 100 mg of JesusOfRave Source #1 MDMA with another 100mg taken an hour in.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t feel the same- I feel a bit anxious, and not very much euphoria. I&#039;m curious as to what you think may be causing this.<br /><br />VARIABLES:<br />1. OTHER MEDS: I&#039;ve started taking Trileptal and have never taken MDMA with it before. Stupidly, I didn&#039;t stop taking it in advance. It&#039;s being taken as a mood stabilizer.<br /><br />2. SOURCE &amp; OTHER EXPERIENCES: I&#039;ve never purchased from JesusOfRave before, though he seems to be a very legitimate seller. Previously, I&#039;ve done molly from BananaSlug off the road, Pink Partyflocks from Schizofreen and Red Armani&#039;s from I forget who. They all felt fairly similar except the Armani&#039;s had a more nasty come-off.<br /><br />3. PRE-MDMA PREP: I&#039;d been dosing 100mg of 5-HTP up until two days prior to this roll. I&#039;ve never done this before.<br /><br />4. RELATIONSHIPS: Last night I had a particularly nasty fight with my love; hence why I was taking the MDMA, to perhaps repair some of the hurt.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you very much for your insight into what may be causing this! I&#039;m still enjoying myself, but have occasional bursts of sorrow intermittent in the MDMA. That&#039;s very weird and unusual for me on Ecstasy. Thanks again!

				how much do you weigh? <br />have you had tolerance issues before? how much have you rolled recently?&nbsp; serotonin&nbsp; takes much longer to replenish stores.. <br />i dunno much about JORs stuff so cant help you there.. if you are alone and already depressed and alone then i dont think mdma is going to help<br />mdma should be a mood enhancer not a magic happy pill..&nbsp; more of the high will come from being out with friends doing something fun.. if its all about the drug then it loses its luster quick <br />just my 2 cents

Not for over two months. Only other substance (besides caffeine) was amphetamine sulfate 3 or 4 days ago.

				I don&#039;t really see a reason trileptal being a reason why you&#039;re not rolling.&nbsp; It&#039;s main use is for epilepsy and I have taken a similar drug called lamotragine which is an anti-convulsant drug but I still rolled and I was using it for it&#039;s mood stabilizer properties.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to find any info on how the drug works in your brain though so I can&#039;t be sure but it may definitely have to do with the trileptal.<br /><br />I would have to say to stop taking it for a day or two seeing it&#039;s half life is 1-5 hours, it should be out of your body completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />SSRI&#039;s are definitely known for causing MDMA not to work at all, which I experienced.&nbsp; It causes the slightest glow that you think it&#039;s going to start working but it just stays like that for while.&nbsp; While it does give you an uplift in mood you can&#039;t help but feel like crap because you realize you can&#039;t roll at all lol.
