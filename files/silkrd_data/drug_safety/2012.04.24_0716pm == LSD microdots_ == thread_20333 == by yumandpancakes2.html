				a local dealer whom I have scored with before says he&#039;s got LSD microdots. His product has always been good, but I&#039;ve never seen nor heard of anyone who has used microdots up until now. Is it possible that the pills contain something other than LSD, and if so, what?

I would just like the novelty. It&#039;s always possible that the pills will contain something other than LSD, just as it&#039;s always possible that the blotter will contain something other than LSD. As a small guide, though, I would be more suspicious the larger the pill. If it looks big enough to contain ecstasy, it&#039;s probably not really LSD. The pills don&#039;t need to be big at all, and they&#039;re called microdots for a reason. If you&#039;re familiar with Lorazepam 0.5mg tablets, I would expect them to be around that size or smaller. But if it&#039;s not LSD, it could be many other psychs, in particular one of the NBOMes as they can often have similar effects.

				Microdots are far better than blotter paper. <br /><br />More efficient absorption of LSD into the body, no ingestion of ink (which is carcinogenic), no bitter taste or burning sensation from the colourants that are added to the ink, etc.<br /><br />I wish they were more widely available.
