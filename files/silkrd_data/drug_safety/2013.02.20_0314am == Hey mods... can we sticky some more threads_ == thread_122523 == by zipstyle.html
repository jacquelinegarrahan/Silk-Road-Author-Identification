				I think there are several threads in the Drug Safety forum that are deserving of a sticky for easier access to others. Just a thought. <br /><br />Anyone else second me on this?

				I&#039;ve been turned down about it several times.&nbsp; If there&#039;s a specific thread that we all agree should be stickied, then we can definitely ask.&nbsp;

				guys, we&#039;d like to be able to sticky threads, but it&#039;s a long process where we need DPR&#039;s direct permission first.

				Ohh, thanks for clarifying that scout. <br />If there&#039;s any way we can help with that process, please let us know!<br />Otherwise I guess we can just make a thread with a list of links to special threads.

				maybe if i start a thread for it, people can post important links (like the ones suggested here) and i can add them to the original post, and then maybe we can get THAT collection stickied.<br /><br />what should we call the thread?&nbsp; :)

				Scout&#039;s right, it&#039;s not easy to get a thread stickied, your best bet would be for scout to start a new one and get approval, I&#039;d say in all honesty your chances of getting existing threads stickied is nil.<br /><br />
