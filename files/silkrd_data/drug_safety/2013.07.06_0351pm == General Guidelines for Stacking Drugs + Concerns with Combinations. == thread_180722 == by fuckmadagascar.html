				After reading through almost every post in the MDMA neurotoxicity thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0) , I&#039;m curious to ask about candy-flipping and the varied combinations of different -flips.<br /><br />Are there general guidelines to follow when stacking drugs?<br /><br />Which ones to combine for positive contributions on your experience, which ones to avoid combining? At what time to take them in relation to each other (from what I gather that would be one after the peak of the other)? What general order should be followed?<br /><br /><br /><br />To give a specific example and tie it into my second question: <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in trying 2C-E or one of its variants (2C-B in particular) and am curious how it would go if I flipped that with MDMA. Both would only be in moderate to light doses being my first time, but I&#039;m concerned over the possibility of the 2C-E promoting MDMA neurotoxicity or contributing to its lasting negative aftereffects.<br /><br />If anyone can provide insight, I would be very thankful for your thoughts. In the meantime I&#039;ll continue to read about the 2C family and see if I can&#039;t answer my own questions.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: For others&#039; benefit and so that I don&#039;t forget what I&#039;ve found and where I found it, here&#039;s a post from AnimusVox on a 2C-B + MDMA combo:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71848.msg590921#msg590921">Quote from: AnimusVox on November 14, 2012, 10:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71848.msg590849#msg590849">Quote from: over easy on November 14, 2012, 09:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be going to a couple of 3 day festivals in the coming months. I&#039;m wondering what my best bet for enjoying the three days to the fullest, while still being safe, is.<br /><br />MDMA I know should only be taken once per every 1-2 months. I&#039;ve heard people drop it all 3 days regardless, how is that even possible? I&#039;m definitely going to take it one of the nights, but I wish I could take it all three.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in 2C-B as well. Probably going to drop around 15 mg so the trip isn&#039;t as heavy and I can still enjoy the performances.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the kind of plan I had in mind:<br /><br />Day 1 - Alcohol only.<br /><br />Day 2 - Drop 15 mg 2C-B around mid-late afternoon, maybe alcohol?<br /><br />Day 3 - Drop 150-175mg MDMA at around 6-7PM to last until 12PM. (Will be preloading/postloading.)<br /><br />Any suggestions for my plan? Should I flip anything around, is there anything I can do more of and still be fine?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m really glad to hear that you will only be partaking in MDMA one day! My personal advice, however, would be to combine the MDMA and 2C-B on a single day when your favorite artists will be performing. I have found taking 160mg of MDMA followed by 20mg of 2C-B T+4:00 to offer the most amazing and all around rewarding experience. I would also limit your alcohol consumption leading up to doing this in order to avoid a hangover affecting your trip. Be sure you eat plenty of healthy food (fruits, vegetables, soup) both before and after tripping and pump yourself with liquids (within moderation). May I ask what you will be pre and postloading with? Also, do you have access to any LSD? LSD is one of the greatest substances for festivals in my experience.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Comment source: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71848.msg590921#msg590921

				Sid Barret formerly of pink floyd ,&nbsp; Brain Wilson from the beach Boys, and john Belushi- are some examples that drug cocktails can have serious repercussions. Weed is the only thing I recommend anyone mix with. Alcohol isn&#039;t eveb a good idea to mix with other drugs. Trippin on L or e is fun in of itself-whats the point in having clean drugs if yoou contaminate the high?<br /><br />Anyways....<br />i can tell you&nbsp; that both Meth and Lsd , as well as Meth and Shrooms do not merge well. Meth and ritalin together are almost&nbsp; like frying minus visuals.<br /><br />Nerotoxicity shouldnt come into play if you&#039;re doing moderate doses,in the course of a day or two so long a s you stay hydrated , say yer prayers and eat your vitamins like a good little hulkamaniac
