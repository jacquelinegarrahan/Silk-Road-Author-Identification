				so I have smoked DMT about a dozen times...<br /><br />...barely could ever hold in enough or go passed the ringing of my ears, had a difficult time lighting freebase dmt...yadda yadda<br /><br />so of those times i would only get geometric patterns, and very VERY quick CEV...that barely lasted..one time i saw a funny creature like laugh at me with a dark tunnel but it vanished quickly and for the most parti had concept of time, space, and hyper aware of my troubles and of those i cared about...so i was a bit apprehensive to smoke more, try harder to get results..besides the smell is horrific to my friends, so its hard for me to keep pressing on for it<br /><br />until i received CHANGA....<br /><br />now this medium of dmt makes the ability to take it in MUCH better...like...a whole lot better (but the smell is just as bad, but fuck you my intolerable smelling friends)<br /><br />so i was relaxed..took a hit and got warped harder than before..i enjoyed it..saw a blue tunnel..came back and told my dear friends..who are scared shitless of it.<br /><br />waited an hour and said &quot;fuck it, this is is..im doing it full blown..&quot; took out a nice mat, laid&nbsp; it out on my balcony, lit some candles, told them to watch me but to not say a&nbsp; fucking word or ill fuck there mother in front of there fucking faces. jk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and now, i will try my best to explain..the unexplainable. <br /><br />i was ripping this shit hard, holding in, blowing out..repeat...got 4 hits total...as I knew i was going to blast off...i laid down held my last hit till i just let it out as naturally, like i was in autopilot and my body decided for itself....the first feelings (mere nano seconds) were again anxiousness...regret, my trials and tribulations, concerns for a better job, the betterment of those I love, follies, etc...a similar thought ive experienced on al my previous non-breakthroughs, it is definitely a hyper awareness thing that is just there by default.<br /><br />That &#039;fear&#039; was gone..due to me being presented in some type of vessel, but a very open one, dark, but i was glistening, with blue and as i gazed above me around 50 degrees up, i was looking into it, a blue tunnel with almost brighter blue electrical currents was what i was being warped through,<br /><br />at this moment i was hearing BEAUTIFUL water like droplets sounds, the way it resonated was something i have never heard before and it was marvelous, only heard about 6 times but jesus christ, it was so cool.<br /><br />now, as this warped tunnel was being travelled through, a blue creature stood aside me, let it be known, all of this im describing you, there was no fear, as i am being shown...its hard to explain but with such a powerful situation, fear takes the back seat.<br /><br />He/she/it turns their hand toward the warp tunnel and i see what looks like the top perspective of a gigantic mushroom cloud, bright orange/yellow, <br /><br />i felt the need to reply to this creature, &#039;Yes. Yes, take me there&quot;<br /><br />and once that was said, it wasnt even as if i&nbsp; was travelling there, or moving, but the top mushroom like expansion had a small center the color of magenta/violet and it was opening.<br /><br />FROM THIS POINT ON, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FUCKING EXPLAIN WHAT THE FUCK FUCKING HAPPENED TO ME<br /><br />all i know is i was grabbing as much as i can, hugging and rolling. asking &quot;why? tell me why?...how can this be?&quot; I was swarming in feelings and taking in thoughts and ideas that were incomprehensible...<br /><br />...and as that happened, the brightness i was in...showed a hint of losing luster, and with that i knew i was being brought back...and i yelled &quot;but i wont remember!..I wont remember this!...repeatedly.<br /><br />i knew, what i saw and felt wont be possible to remember.<br /><br />i open my eyes, look at my sister and ask her how long was i gone? it felt like hours......she replied 10 minutes, and you looked very peaceful.<br /><br />i did not say a word out loud the whole time and my right hand flickered for a moment.&nbsp; I almost teared as i tried to describe them what happened, and after that experience, i no longer fear this substance. I am completely captivated and find it to be exactly as those who described it to be.<br /><br />I know with experience i will maybe be able to take more knowledge and memory back with me on that trip, but my god is it majestic,<br /><br />all the best guys.<br /><br />

				no no, its not that i prefer. its my choice of action of what I want to take and experience.<br /><br />I havent even tried pharma.&nbsp; i just feel like I want to go 0 to 100mph and see the vast, overwhelming, confusing majestic trip...a&nbsp; few times..and almost &#039;get familiar&#039; with this hard to grasp, easy to get lost experience so that WHEN i try pharma for the first time..it will be like a slow, 1800&#039;s locomotion, and i can look and see everything in great detail and good understanding, since i was zooming by it on dmt freebase and changa.<br /><br />

				dude you dont need to take pharma pills to breakthrough.<br /><br />if anything, smoking dmt is the fastest and easiest route.<br /><br />i just think, from what im getting, since you have smoked it a few times like i have, you just stopped right before the brink.....<br /><br />i like..subliminally would stop..like in my head im like &quot;ok ok..i feel pressure..so ill stop&quot;<br /><br />so, yeah, i stopped doing that, you have to GOOOOOO...and keeep going...this drug is safe. know that, and with that knowledge...take deep hits..hold..repeat, keep going man. hold the last one and lie down.<br /><br />

				Thanks for advice, StickAFinger, you&#039;re probably right too :) Though my friend on a pharma pill said that when a person next to him smoked DMT, it caused him to pretty much break through just by breathing the smell... Interesting.

				It is scary up until you breakthrough, fear of the unknown, but soon as you get to that place, all fear dissipates, the most overwhelmingly beautiful&nbsp; , awe inspiring experience you will ever have just takes over your entire being.....<br /><br />I can feel the bliss just talking about it.....<br /><br />Take the leap, just do it, fall in.....

				yeah man, the only real fear is the &#039;&#039;pressure building&quot; that starts as you rip and hold...repeat<br /><br />but seriously, once a breakthrough happens, like spice said, its overwhelming.&nbsp; and another crazy thing...EVERY DRUG TAKES A BACK SEAT<br /><br />i literally had no want to do anything for like a week. i was content, i read an interview about someone having the same thing and joe rogan (comedian/phsych drug enthusiast) said the same thing too<br /><br />gonna breakthrough again later this week, off a bong this time. 200mg changa, one/two hits. i did a water bowl on my first breakthrough, i went so hard on 4 hits, packed the fuck out of it...when i buy enough change (only have 1 gram left,) i will be hopefully professional enough to keep pulling through out the trip to keep a peak lasting over 1 hr as i have read it is very possible with changa.
