				Just recently acquired some of this stuff from new vendor Righteous - and I&#039;m about 30 minutes into the experience. SO I figured I would take the opportunity to write this so people who have 4-HO-MiPT coming in from him know what to expect! Sorry if this gets progressively less coherent as I go on, this product comes on so quickly. Really took me by surprise.<br /><br />T - 30 - Measured roughly 12 mg, placed into gelatin capsule. Did 1 mg allergy test with the leftover powder on the scale, no negative effects <br /><br />T +- 0 Noticing no negative effects, swallowed gelatin capsule. Can sorta feel a vague sorta feeling in my body like a very very small dose of M1, but it&#039;s nice and alleviates the tension I have about the trip to come, as I have not experienced this particular compound before. It is about 10:30 PM.<br /><br />T + 10 minutes : definite build-up of body-load in the past few minutes. Tactile sensation increased exponentially. Texture is amazing. Mild visual distortion present, but it can be ignored. Instead, I find that right now the things that I normally push out of my sight as visual &#039;background noise&#039; can be seen much more clearly. That is to say, I can see every fucking particle of dust and debris that has collected on my monitor. Even as I write this I can feel the experience building like a roller-coaster going up the first big hill. There is minor jaw discomfort at this point, but it is ignorable to a certain extent. I wouldn&#039;t necessarily say it&#039;s a problem with clenching, but just an odd feeling connecting from my gums to my teeth. It&#039;s distracting, but not too terrible.<br /><br />T + 15 - Everything is starting to take more of an orangish, terra cotta tint. I am more cold now than I was five minutes ago, but it feels like I&#039;m sweating. The temperature has stayed the same. There is some mild nausea with the body-load, which is exacerbated by a bad cough I have been having recently.<br /><br />T + 20 - I have been playing with my kitten which has brought up thoughts of sentience and all other sorts of metaphysical matters. The kitten is very cute and wants to be whereever i&#039;m at. And OH MY FUCKING GOD IS IT SO SOFT I CANT STOP PETTING IT.<br /><br />T + 30 - Start writing this post, the cat is sitting on my computer desk now, watching the words move around as I type. The cat&#039;s purring is rhythmical and soothing, I quite like it.<br />There is some building gastrointestinal discomfort as well as some odd pain in my right ankle. I recently had reconstructive ankle surgery so it does start to hurt randomly, sometimes.<br /><br />The computer screen has some serious trails building on it and my cat looks increasingly more and more like a cartoon character or a feline corgi or something. She&#039;s trying to bite the words off the screen.<br /><br />I think I was rambling... Hahaha. IT&#039;s hard to read the screen because of the cat and I don&#039;t want to move her from her spot. I will return intermittently throughout the trip with updates, although I am not feeling quite as scientifically minded as I did when I started writing this so the frequency of these updates I do not know :P<br /><br />An enjoyable experience so far. :]

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97211.msg689132#msg689132">Quote from: Aurelius Venport on December 29, 2012, 04:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">sounds like a classic mushroom trip. I get very similar effect to what your describing. however i have only tripped 3 times and always 1-2 grams. Enjoy! seriously considering buying a gram or two when i have some loot. it might be a great low dose cut for m1 I think. dont forget the personal aspect of tripping and try to gain as much as you can from the experience :) enjoy. ps - in regard to your comment, I prefer rolling alone actually, and if I really wanna vibe with people I just use the phone or FB. but being alone is superior imo unless ur comparing it to a really good dj / club. as for psychadelics, my most intense experience I had someone sort of guide me and he was sober and it really helped with the tough spots where the trip was getting really scary.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s good stuff. I mean, I can&#039;t compare it to any other tryptamine because my experience in that field is rather limited, however it has a more light-hearted feel than some of the phenethylamines I&#039;ve had the pleasure of trying, in specific 2c-e. There&#039;s nothing that feels really &#039;pushy&#039; about this experience, like I get with phenethylamines... If I could adequately compare them, I would say that this definitely feels more sense-enhancing than them, which to me generally either inhibit my senses or make it harder to understand them. Like when I&#039;m on 25i or 2ce, for example, emotional context is sorta gone... it&#039;s like a naivety, but more dark so than I feel this is. This feels incredibly light-hearted and positive, which might be because my life has just started to get better in the past week or so than it has been for the past few months ( I haven&#039;t been able to walk very much until very recently because of my ankle ) and I just got a new job that I&#039;m enjoying a lot so far so that could just be the set, y&#039;know? All the times I did 2ce and the one time I did 25i there was always some bullshit clouding the air and they masked that a little bit and made them a bit easier to handle. Or they put me so far out of my comfort zone I could approach situations objectively from a perspective I haven&#039;t thought of. <br /><br />With this, the focus seems to be more on the appreciation of my newfound circumstances than anything. But at 12 mg, it&#039;s a very functional dose... very recreational, that is. I don&#039;t feel there&#039;s too much otherworldly insight from this compound at this level, but it is VERY fun. xD I might redose later with something higher if I feel I can handle it. I have very limited psychedelic experience, so I most definitely do not want to push myself&nbsp; too far.<br /><br />Also...<br /><br />The body sensation has for the most part leveled out, however the visuals seem to be steadily increasing. Very noticeable trails and the world has a sorta blazed terra-cotta pot sorta look and texture to it. I wouldn&#039;t call the visuals at this level spectacular by any means, but they are very nice. The most interesting thing about this compound to me are just the increase in every single sense - tactile sensation is amazing, taste is enhanced. The most noticeable though is the increase in smell; I can smell my fucked up sinuses, and every smell or sound has some sort of emotional context to it. It&#039;s quite interesting...

				awesome report!!!!!<br /><br />sounds like a promising compound!!!<br /><br />do you have any m1 in your stash right now? would love to see how they go together from future trips....I was thinking of putting in like 8-10 mg with a lower dose of m1, like ~100-125ish mg and seeing how those turned out. I find m1 to be a little too mild and would like to find a cost effective cut / potentiator that might give it a push in the right direction.... up lol

And don&#039;t you think if I had any left it&#039;d be gone? Hahaha. I mean back when I was moving it most of my days were spent on it so if I had any left I would have definitely used it by now. It&#039;s still probably my drug of choice by a longshot. I remember one time, me and two associates had 100 grams and we were all staying at the same apartment so naturally we were all staying up and doing it and thinking about grandiose shit that we could do to &#039;make it big&#039;, and by the end of the week we had each personally probably gone through at least a quarter. You don&#039;t think about that when you&#039;re doing it, that you&#039;re taking like a GRAM a fucking day. That was a lot to me. That&#039;s sorta when I stopped using it so frequently, &#039;cause it lost its magic during that time period, too. A lot of it was that me and the two other guys were pushing off inevitable impending doom and just sorta hoping for the best and using the M1 to cope, I feel. <br /><br />Plus I wouldn&#039;t have wanted to do any of the 20 grams or so I got. I felt almost ashamed selling it. Looked more like mephedrone than methylone, and had about the same potency, but the subtle effects were different so I was almost sure it was M1. But it just wasn&#039;t good stuff. I wound up giving the last gram or two of it away to an ex-girlfriend &#039;cause I didn&#039;t even want to think about it. It also had a WAY, WAY more distinct &#039;bath salts&#039; smell to it, chemically sweet but in all the bad ways. Anyway, depending on how well this sells I might be connecting with an old partner and going halvsies on 100 g&#039;s from Nevita, who by far had/has the best M1 I&#039;ve personally had on SR.

				Well guys, I have to say that what I said about this substance not being challenging at 12 mg ABSOLUTELY does not apply when increased. I redosed about 15 mg about 2 - 3 hours into the trip and jesus christ, it knocked me off my ass. The eye candy was insane, it was absolutely the most out of any of the few psychedelics I&#039;ve tried. Whereas on 12 if I focused the world started to morph nicely, it was absolutely impossible to ignore after the redose. Also, it made me quite delirious - one time I went to get a soda, took it to my room, decided I wanted water and took the soda back to get the water and then came back and wondered where the soda went. I also got stuck in another loop where I would get out of my seat at the computer to go smoke a cigarette, look at my cat, lay down and play with my cat, then get up to get on the computer. Rinse and repeat. All the loops weren&#039;t a bad thing, as it&#039;s the first time i&#039;ve ever looped and it was an eye-opening experience. <br /><br />The nausea was absolutely non-existent, which was amazing because I have been sick lately ( bronchitis I think ) and I really expected to vomit. That being said, the vomiting during pretty much every other psychedelic experience I&#039;ve had has always been a really integral part of the experience for me... seeing my puke change colors and morph and the feeling of nausea leaving my body as well as the weakness I have... I don&#039;t know, it all just combines and it makes me feel reborn in a way. But every all the other time I&#039;ve done psychedelics I&#039;ve been at my old apartment, and last night I was at my folks house ( irresponsible, I know, but I&#039;ve handled myself around them on worse ) so the fact that I didn&#039;t have to puke was nice.<br /><br />Time dilation was a central theme of the trip - I examined that as I was coming down and becoming more lucid and noticed that it seemed as if I was experiencing each moment of cognition in like fourths of a second. I realized that I often soberly think that I don&#039;t have enough time to do things and that time flies by extremely quickly, when it&#039;s just the fact that I don&#039;t commit to memory each individual moment in my life. I listened to music during this period and found that every syllable was more pronounced, that I could understand songs that I normally didn&#039;t know wtf was happening in. <br /><br />I came to terms with some aspects of my life that I had been struggling with and realized that although I thought I was really happy lately I was just ignoring a lot of things in my life that made me unhappy and then wrote that ignorance off as happiness. I pulled this back in with the time dilation aspect, and realized that I was essentially making micro-transactions of time because of my own boredom and loneliness, trading pieces of my life because I&#039;m afraid to experience them.<br /><br /><br />So, in essence, I have to say that at probably 10 - 15 mg, this substance is a very fun time with pretty moderate visuals but redosed around 30 mg it can be a scary but extremely valuable experience. I really enjoyed it. One thought I had while tripping was &quot;I don&#039;t know what to sell this for... I have no idea how to quantify this experience...&quot; so that gives an idea of what I was feeling. I probably should have waiting and tried it along with someone else or someone sober, because of the extreme head trip I was in, but I really think that the negatives were an integral part of the experience. Just like the pukiness I always get with phenethylamines.

				In regards to the first quote, I was trying to say that I was having a lot of looping thought patterns as well as looping actions; just thinking about the cause and effect of certain aspects of my life and how they all interconnected. As far as the delirium goes I was unable to move or think clearly while I was looping ( the looping lasted for I would say 3 - 4 hours after the redose. I redosed at aprox 1:30 AM, and was still tripping at 8 this morning. So the redose extended the trip a bunch as I was sorta leveled out around 1. <br /><br />2nd, basically I was trying to say that I have beeen basically selling part of my cognizance off in exchange for a pseudo-happiness that came from ignorance of my real situation. Without going into too much detail of my personal situation in life, when I was a kid I didn&#039;t have many friends at all, and since high school started I&#039;ve always been surrounded by friends, whether it was in high school, in college, when I was living on my own renting with a friend... then I got into a car accident and lost my job and have been living with my folks and it&#039;s been lonely and that scares me a lot because it reminds me of my childhood which brings back bad memories. So instead of being productive and working through my problems, I&#039;ve been becoming more of a recluse and returning to the things I was doing as a child to cope with not being surrounded with people all the time. <br /><br />and 3rd, I don&#039;t really have a measure to compare it too... as I&#039;ve said, I&#039;ve only done phenethylamines and m1 and some various other RC&#039;s and various stims/opiates so there really isn&#039;t an adequate comparison for it in my experience. There were so many aspects of it, it&#039;s hard to make a comparison. It was at times extremely confusing, at times enlightening, and the visuals were most definitely far far greater than anything I&#039;ve ever experienced. The fractals and patterning were AMAZING, I remember staring at my wall for a good hour while I was looping and the paint drips looked like some sort of Mayan carving, really really interesting. I saw Quetzalcoatl and jaguars and shit and the further along the wall I moved the more of a story it told. Can&#039;t remember that story, though, sadly :P
