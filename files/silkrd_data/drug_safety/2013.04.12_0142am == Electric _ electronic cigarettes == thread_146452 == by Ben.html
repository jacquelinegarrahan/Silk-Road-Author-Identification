				Just curious about it: do any of you used to smoke normal cigs and switched to electric cigarettes and such to deliver nicotine?<br /><br />I have tried several years ago and back then the electric product did not cut it by far, but perhaps things have changed over the last couple of years. <br /><br />Is there currently something on the market that is about as good as smoking a real cigarette? Or at least something that provides an acceptable smoking experience in situations where no smoking is allowed?

				I currently have an electric cigarette. I was never really a cigarette smoker, but I decided to get an electric cigarette for smoke tricks and the nicotine. I have had it for a few months now and love it, but I have started to smoke cigs. I would highly recommend it because, yes, I do love to smoke real cigarettes, but electric cigarettes are awesome. I can literally smoke it anywhere and I really no longer get buzz from just smoking one cigarette, but if I smoke two in a row I do feel the consequences. Electric cigarettes still give me a good buzz however and the flavor possibilities are endless. You can search on google and find any eliquid to fill your cartridges. It saves a lot of money over cigarettes and gets you a good buzz. I have a v2 electric cigarette which is one of the top brands along with blu and some others. If you have any questions feel free to pm me.

				Now, I&#039;m not a smoker, but I have an ecig I use for thc products. What I really like is there is no prep, no button or anything, stick in mouth and inhale. Done.<br /><br />I have to wonder if this would help to smoke less? Now I know you can just put a cigarette out, but you are probably going to smoke the whole thing most of the time just because it is there and already lit?

				Sure, once you light a cigarette you are going to finish it, not stub it out halfway and then smoke the remaining half at a later time. As these e-cigs deliver the dose per-puff instead of as one fag that consists of numerous puffs it could reduce your intake. It could also increase it when you only have a minute or so to smoke and lighting up a cig would not be worthwhile, where taking a puff or two from an e-cig would be. <br /><br />I suppose the chief difference would be on how safely you can deliver a drug though. Nicotine as such is an addictive drug with some potential negative health effects, but the dangers from smoking are mostly due to tar and such. Any means of delivering the nicotine punch of cigarettes without exposure to smoke of burning vegetable matter would be a health benefit even if the nicotine itself is not addressed at all.

				as a long time smoker who recently swiched to e-cigs, i can tell you it&nbsp; will take some time , 2 - 3 weeks for me, before it feels natural. but it is pretty awesome after that. the only time i crave a real cig is at parties and the like.

				When I saw the topics title a story of a friend came to my mind that I need to share for your safety.<br /><br />If you decide to switch to electronic cigarette you have to do a really good research before you buy your product and ask a doctor to certify the quality of your el cig.<br /><br />Last year a friend of mine wanted to switch to el cig. As you have noticed many different companies have supplied the market with lots of different products. Unfortunately many of them have not been approved or certified for their quality and safety. <br /><br />So this friend had been smoking his el cig for about 6 months and one day while he was working he collapsed and had problems breathing. He was taken to the hospital where immediately received a lung surgery. He managed to survive of course but when he came back and was interviewed by the doctor he was asked: &quot;you do smoke from an el cig right?&quot; <br /><br />His work conditions helped to make this problem worse cause he was spending time in fridges but his doctor said the main source of his condition came from using a non certified el cig that didn&#039;t make &quot;healthy&quot; smoke. His lungs had been fulled by liquids that came from his el cig. <br /><br />In this market there are products that has a variety when it comes to prices 40-200 Euros. <br />I won&#039;t say that an el cig is bad for you but if you really want to use them you have to invest money on it in order to acquire one which has been QC by doctors. <br /><br />Be careful when you buy electronic products. A mobile phone that is a copy brand cannot do any harm to you, but buying a cheap el cig can cause you really big health problems. <br /><br />Be careful people and stay safe.<br /><br />Adamiz<br />

Sorry but I laughed with this. Didn&#039;t mean to give you worries. Just warning you people.<br />But yes. If you are going to use it permanently I would strongly advice you to check for its quality.<br />If you bought it relevantly at a cheap price then the best thing you can do is to search about it on the internet and definitely take it to a doctor or to a pharmacy so you can have a better and more scientific opinion.<br /><br />Funny fact by the way that the let e-cigs out in the market so freely without any quality checks. But from another side I don&#039;t know how the situation is right now. My story and opinion are based on 18 months earlier market. Maybe now they have banned some of the fake/cheap brands. Still worth the time to check it out.<br /><br />Adamiz

				I doubt my GP would have any insight into electric cigarettes really - surely some patients use them, but what brands and models are more dangerous than others&nbsp; would be a big unknown. <br /><br />I do wonder what they put in the ones that results in pulmonary edema though. Normal ingredients like PEG and nicotine or approved flavourings certainly would not produce such side effects.
