				will it show up as a benzo? has anyone done the test fairly soon after using etiz?<br /><br />&nbsp;I have been informed by a guy that gets regularly tested for off-shore work that diazapam can hang around in your system for a couple of weeks, am now thinking i could have compromised myself with a recent one off etizolam use.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s a really good question.<br /><br />Logically I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have a problem. If you&#039;re talking about the piss test you shouldn&#039;t have an issue. <br /><br />The benzo panel will be testing either for unmetabolised benzos (ie that pass straight through) or for a specific metabolite, a chemical that the body produces that has a chemical reaction in the test to show up &quot;positive&quot; if you&#039;ve used them.<br /><br />But etizolam is not a benzo, it is a benzo analog (check the wikipedia page).<br /><br />According to wiki etizolam has a very fast metabolism, 6 hour half life - I reckon as long as it&#039;s been 3 days you&#039;ll have no worries at all.<br /><br />If the test is for pre-employment screening and if you&#039;re really concerned about it just tell them your mum gave you a valium because you were so nervous about getting an awesome job :)<br /><br />Sorry couldn&#039;t give you any firm evidence, maybe I&#039;ll order a kit just to find out :)

				it can show up depending on the test. at my treatment place the instant tests that they use it shows up as a benzo but when they send it in for advanced lab testing it doesnt show up. so use discretion and be careful.

				I took 2mg the night before a drug test and the test was about 7 hours later so the metabolite was still active and there was no result for benzodiazepines.

				It is possible, but very unlikely.&nbsp; Also some 5 panel test don&#039;t even have benzos.&nbsp; I know when i was on probation i would take benzos all the time and they didn&#039;t ever test for them.
