				Title: <strong>MDMA Help?</strong><br />

				Hey all,<br /><br />So last night I took 150mg of tony76&#039;s MDMA with a friend at an electronic concert. We got there around 9:00, each dropped 150, and over the next few hours it was definitely working - tactile enhancement, body heat rising, pupils dilated, etc... - but it felt like it was on edge the whole time, never really hit me if you know what I mean and my friend felt the same way - that we weren&#039;t really rolling. Why do you think this is? Should I have taken more? I don&#039;t doubt the purity of the product, tony is by far one of the best vendors on here.<br /><br />Other info:<br /><br />I&#039;ve been experimenting with other phenethylamines lately, 2c-b in particular, but it&#039;s been over a week since my last dose of that. My friend doesn&#039;t do anything aside from cannabis.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on a pretty heavy regimen of Mucinex D (psuedophedrine) the last week but I didn&#039;t take it the day I dropped the molly.<br /><br />We were both kinda skeeved out by the venue, security was ridiculously horrible, I got pushed up against a wall and searched in the bathroom. We also had to look out for a couple of our drunk friends for a good portion of the come-up of the MDMA. Could our setting have played a part?<br /><br />I consider myself a new user to MDMA, the last time I rolled was off one of Dr. Amsterdam&#039;s 174mg Red Stars, split into quarters - 3/4 taken followed by the other 1/4 at T-1:30, and I rolled really hard. <br /><br />What do you think the deal is? Too low of a dose? Bad mindset going into it? Would that be enough to negate the effects of 150mg?<br /><br />I usually throw up right as I peak, that&#039;s how I know I&#039;m rolling, but it didn&#039;t happen last night. <br /><br />Anyways, any advice you can offer would be VERY appreciated. Thanks :)<br />S<br /><br /><br />

				Perhaps you had not been preloading and postloading. Perhaps your PEA tolerance was still around. Perhaps the difference between 150 and 174 is noticeable for you.<br /><br />I will be trying tony&#039;s MDMA eventually and I will make a judgment on the purity. I don&#039;t doubt tony, so I think it&#039;s something you did.

				Yeah, I think I&#039;ll start pre/post loading. Is there any regimen that you recommend? <br /><br />Next time I think I&#039;m going to dose up a little bit and see if that makes a difference. <br /><br />Yeah, I definitely don&#039;t doubt the quality of the product, consensus in the review forum is incredibly favorable. Oh well, thanks for the advice!

				Well, I take 5-HTP twice daily and it could be placebo but I feel like I roll way better because of it.

				The problem is not you, it is Tony&#039;s MDMA. It is cut significantly with what I think is caffeine powder and/or some inert substance. It feels very &quot;clean&quot; but is SIGNIFICANTLY weaker than other quality MDMA I have purchased on SR (Ivory, Mitanox).<br /><br />I have now sampled it twice, and have given it to dozens of my experienced friends. We all agree it&#039;s cut 30-50% by weight. So if you want a roll similar to 150mg of pure mdma, take ~250-275mg of tony&#039;s product. <br /><br />Despite this, I will likely order Tony&#039;s mdma again. I don&#039;t think it is cut with any other substances besides mdma, and at the price and with his domestic shipping location it is still attractive.

				I&#039;ve actually been talking to a couple other people as well, they share my sentiment that you don&#039;t really get that MDMA rush at the dose you normally should - you know, that &quot;ohmygodimrollingface&quot; moment? <br /><br />Yeah, its definitely very clean... Hmm... This is strange. There&#039;s some really rave reviews in his review thread. I&#039;ll shoot him a PM to see if he can shed any light on this, by no means am I angry about the product or feel entitled to a refund. Tony is a standup vendor, and I&#039;m sure if you worked it out his MDMA/Dollar ratio would be far better than anyone else&#039;s, it&#039;d just be nice to know so I can weigh it out and get to the place I want to be at. <br /><br />I may try Ivory in the near future, always had great experiences with him. <br /><br />Peace and Love.

				There have been quite a few reports of Tony&#039;s MDMA not being as good as some others or not reacting as violently to reagent tests. Not sure what that&#039;s about as I haven&#039;t done it myself but it&#039;s worth knowing.

				Taking pseudoephedrine for a week would likely have decreased the bioavailability of the MDMA, by promoting expression of enzymes that oxidize both of them. Although if your friend didn&#039;t feel it aswell it may have been the setting or the chemical (unless they had also been taking a phenethylamine analogue such as pseudoephedrine).

				It&#039;s not cut with caffeine. I am sworn off caffeine and I did not have any jitters, speediness, rush, or difficulty sleeping from Tony&#039;s MDMA.<br /><br />Now, I had about 180mg and felt like I had 120mg, so I&#039;m not going to discredit claims of being cut... but I&#039;m not going to accuse either, because who knows why I felt like it wasn&#039;t enough?
