				I have a tolerance problem guys.<br /><br />first off my opiate experience is about 4 1/2 years of oxycodone abuse. I would get 120 30mg from doctor and sniff em all within a week 1/2, then the rest of the month i&#039;d buy em from a friend. So i was doing about 5-8 30&#039;s i believe a day, sometimes would throw in a 80mg. but well over 260mg a day normally off oxy up the nose. I never even when i started got a nod. sometimes on a very heavy dose i would get a itch. And i knew tons of people if they sniff 2-3 30mg oxycodone ir&#039;s they would be totally fucked up nodding out.<br /><br />So i got on suboxone for a good 6 months, got off the opiates, 9 months later i moved to a diff state. I had no access to opiates till i had a friend refer me to SR because i wanted to get some MDMA and he ordered his from here. But when i was browsing i saw the opiate section and i heard in my head like angles going AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. so ofcourse i looked, i saw how OMG expensive the opiate pain killers are, like a 30mg is $30-35 here, and where i&#039;m from street they are $10. $80 here for a 80mg, and $25 at where i use to live. omg what a rape. but i looked at the H section. I&#039;ve never done H before, it was kinda expensive here to, and H is sopose to be WAY less than oxy/pain killer pills. So i am like what it hell, maybe it will be stronger. So i bought my first batch. it was from digitalink. it was utter GARBAGE. 2.5 GRAMS didnt even get me high. Then i ordered from dolphan, i didnt know a point was so smaller, so i was able to sniff that whole thing and it kinda gave me a tiny buzz. Then i ordered from wumg00. for the first time ever i IV&#039;d. and i had a hard time hitter a vein, i still do its a big issue i need help with but i live alone, i know no one that does IV or any drugs up here. so i need help with iv&#039;ing, im very skinny and have good veins but i 1 out of like 5 tries i actually get the blood to flow back into the rig. i did a match head IV of wumg00&#039;s and nothing (i am very scared because people say his is so strong its dangerous) well i kept bumping up till i was doing 0.1 and kinda got a buzz, no rush. after a lot of testing i got a buzz off of 0.3 , but i&#039;ve never been able to get a rush. after about 30 minutes when i IV i get a nodd and off wumg&#039;s ive been able to nod for the first time in my life really well, like pass out nodd. BUT never got a rush and never experinced a nice warm wave of pleasure when i IV.<br /><br />Why is my tolerance so damn high, why can&#039;t i get a rush. You guys mostly are pros here. Please help me enjoy this H like you guys do :( . i know i am getting the highest quality avalible from people here on SR, but i can&#039;t get near the high people talk about here.<br /><br />Thanks for your help i am really looking forward to getting a better H experience!

				Go big or go home on the first try. Pretty much what I do, though my tolerance is not near as high. <br /><br />if you don&#039;t understand i mean just take nearly twice as much as you would normally do your first try. If you keep trying to follow up, like Shoot a tenth, then an hour later shoot another one. It won&#039;t get you any higher, just will drag on what you&#039;re feeling already. <br /><br />Also throw alcohol in the mix to, just a beer or so though i wouldn&#039;t advice drinking anymore than that, quite dangerous lol. Alcohol always seems to intensify it a little more for me.<br /><br />Though this advice is coming from someone with a much lower tolerance than you...Hope it helps. I&#039;m not an expert lol.

				Sorry to hear about your tolerance issues. You may just not have waited long enough, or even if you had waited longer, tolerances develop much more rapidly once you begin using again. <br /><br />Besides weening off some to reduce your tolerance, there are people who report a moderate dose of ketamine reduces ones tolerance significantly. <br /><br />Some people unfortunately have minor mutations in their amino acid sequence encoding receptor proteins, which can cause personal variations in responses to ligands. You may unfortunately be one of the people who has a receptor conformation with decreased affinity or activity, causing a greatly reduced effect compared to the wildtype population. <br /><br />Regardless of the situation, it seems like you are going to need heroic heroin doses that would easily kill the average inexperienced man. This could also easily kill ones wallet, or kill one while unfortunate user is stealing one&#039;s wallet... :P<br /><br />To help reduce the woes one may face, there are many pharmacological approaches you could take to minimize the amount of your stash you consume while maximizing the effect. <br /><br />The first will be to try out the various potent opioids, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, diamorphine, etc. and determine what fits your receptor best. Also varying the different drug consumed occasionally can help reduce tolerance and maintain effects. <br /><br />Secondly, look into potientiators, which will be an invaluable asset. There are tons to name and look into, but the idea is the same. Through some pharmacological mechanism it actually increases the effects of the opiate so you need less to achieve the same effect. It is important to note this can obviously be *dangerous* and may increase the risk of overdose, so caution should be taken to gently approach your total dose. There is a thread about it here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6830.msg60463#msg60463<br /><br />I dont remember exactly which work with H or oxy... but the idea is pertinent. For example, you can block your opiate receptors in the periphery with loperamide so that less oxy binds there and is more concentrated in the cns. Or you can use anti-histamines or anti-cholinergics to increase the euphoria and sedation. Or you can use grapefruit juice or tagamet I think to inhibit the enzymes that breakdown oxy so you remain high longer. You can also use prilosec or nexium as a drug efflux pump inhibitor which will reduce the amount of the opiate which is pumped back out of the cns, increasing the concentration and potency.&nbsp; Do some research, and with the correct careful combination you will hopefully be able to achieve a reasonably satisfying experience. <br /><br />Good luck, and stay safe!<br />- miR<br /><br />

				you sound like a big guy, or you have a very poor diet? either way, alkalize your blood (baking soda or tums, eaten obv) and grapefruit juice to inhibit shitty liver enzymes, and you should feel a lot more, and for a lot longer. <br /><br />also, any other sedatives, antihistamines, antichollinergics, or weed. or all of them. but be careful in the combonationing.

				For H it supposedly works too, but what is occurring is the inhibition of the enzymes that metabolize opiates. therefore, you will not intensify the effect, just make them last longer. it is important the grapefruit juice is fresh (refrigerated) and not from concentrate, take 45 min before. or you could take cimetidine (tagamet) which is even more preferable and stronger an hour before the opiate.<br /><br />In reading, some have said there are two things that may reduce your tolerance. One is dextromethorphan or ketamine, which can also potentiate the effects. <br /><br />Another is a potentiator known as a CCK inh that may be worth more research in the future, one called proglumide

				the curse of the opiate addict is the tolerance, our habits are very cheap until we need 10 times the amount we first nodded the fuck out on to just get well. <br /><br />The dangerous thing with going for a hard first shot is that your dope can always be different this is what led me to my only overdose. same stamp same smell, normal dose, i didn&#039;t even have time to pull my rig out of my arm. so i&#039;d be careful if you are just going to wing it and &quot;go big or go home&quot;. <br /><br />It really doesn&#039;t come to mind when we are out running but this shit is dangerous and will kill you if you underestimate it. It sounds hypocritical coming from an IV junkie of 6 years but it&#039;s a real eye opener when you finally fall out from doing what you thought was a rinky dink shot.

				How long were you off of the suboxone for? I&#039;m in no means an opiate expert but I&#039;ve heard it ruining opiates for people, either that or they needed to be off of it for MONTHS to get close to the same high they achieved before. If you haven&#039;t already you should check out Bluelight I&#039;m sure there are a ton of threads that could help you out, or at least better understand what&#039;s going on.

				I think if you are hugely tolerant, it is time to quit and move onto something else. Maybe try morphine, pathedine or something similar.<br /><br />I believe if you are tolerant you can still easily take a lethal dose.

				yeah, def subs will help ween you off, but then again you can just grow dependent on them, just like heroin addicts can get hooked onto methadone. Also they do increase your tolerance later.&nbsp; No matter how long of a break you take from opiates / opiods,&nbsp; once you start back up with whatever you take, in no time will you be right back at our usual crazy high tolerance.&nbsp; Never will norcos be fun anymore, or anything mild.&nbsp; wow, I remember the days when 1-2 yellow norcos with a few beers would be amazing, or when freebasing a half to a full 80 was amazing, or 1 30 roxi was perfect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now its like 2 roxi to just feel ok.&nbsp;
