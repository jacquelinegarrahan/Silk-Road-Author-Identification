				I&#039;ve only ever used BTH, and you had to cook that up, else it never would dissolve (sometimes it&#039;s even hard to dissolve when cooked!). But I got some #4 (thanks Supreme Smoke) and I&#039;ve just been cooking it out of habit. I put a lighter under it until the solution boils at the side of the solution and then stir it. But I notice that it doesn&#039;t NEED cooking to dissolve. I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m &#039;stressing&#039; the dope, I don&#039;t know maybe breaking it down or something. <br />When it dissolves without problem is there any need to heat it up?<br />BTW I recommend SS, it&#039;s good dope and he&#039;s FAST.

				If you&#039;re IVing, then YES.<br />&quot;Cooking&quot; is completely unnecessary for dissolving, but should alway be done due to the risk of bacterial infection.<br />Cold shooting always carries the risk of getting some nasty buggers in your arm, which can multiply to give you gangrene and other horrible conditions.<br />Stay safe bro.

				#4 heroin will dissolve in water with just a little heat.&nbsp; It does not require large amounts of heat.&nbsp; To actually kill any bacteria you would have to heat it for 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />From past experience I would suggest using distilled or sterile water, a good micron filter (cotton if you cannot get that) a new syringe and just enough heat to get the #4 to dissolve, also make sure to use a clean or new cooker each time.&nbsp; Use alcohol to clean the spoon or whatever you are using to heat the solution, use an alcohol swab where you plan to do the injection.&nbsp; As long as you follow those few simple steps the chances of infection are next to nil.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use the same injection site each time, move it around.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one thing to look out for when IV&#039;ing is abscesses.&nbsp; Pay attention to your skin, check it every now and then for redness and swelling.&nbsp; Abscesses start out small, usually a small red swollen section of skin.&nbsp; If left untreated in several days it could swell up and spread over your whole forearm.&nbsp; If you do see an abscess start, don&#039;t wait too long, go to the doctor and get some antibiotics. If you treat it early it will disappear within a 5-7 days but if you leave it you could end up at the hospital with them cutting it open to drain it and having to give you intravenous antibiotics.<br /><br />If they ask how you got it, say you think that&#039;s where your cat scratched you some time ago.

				#4 heroin is heroin hydrochloride so additives are not necessary for dissolving. Heat should also be unnecessary because one should only ever use sterile water in the first place.
