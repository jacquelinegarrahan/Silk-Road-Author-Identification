				1. Been smoking marijuana regularly for the last 8 years<br />2. About 1 year ago I switched to using a vaporizer<br />3. About 2 months ago I went back to smoking<br />4. After I started smoking again I developed a constant cough and would wheeze when I woke up in the mornings<br />5. Last week I smoked a joint and almost immediately afterwards I began to feel like I couldn&#039;t breathe. Pain in my chest, felt like I was being choked, I was wheezing constantly, thought I was going to die. Tried to stay awake all night because I was worried I might die in my sleep, but passed out (lol).<br />6. When I woke up the morning after that, I felt fine, but cautious so I used the vaporizer<br />7. Immediately after vaporizing I started having the same feeling except even worse than before<br />8. Went to hospital. Diagnosed acute bronchitis, given breathing treatment, steroids and antibiotics. <br />9. Been feeling pretty good since using the various medications, but have not smoked or vaporized at all.<br />10. Wondering if vaporizing is safe?

				It&#039;s not the carbon monoxide you gotta worry about, it&#039;s just the irritation. Even vapor causes that. Give it a week or two.

When you burn the weed you&#039;re getting that harsh smoke. Vaporizing is usually better for me. I just was trying to help you out.

				The idea that you got weed laced with something was at the top of my head when I started reading this thread.<br />Weed was commonly laced with PCP in certain circle back in the day. and there have been plenty of reports of people getting grass that was cut with it or other chemicals (both active and inactive)<br /><br />FastForward to 2012 and MXE has become extremely popular and I personally find it to be very similar to PCP when smoked. But it does make it very hard to breathe afterwards. And I could totally see the same douchebags that use to lace cheap weed with PCP doing the same thing with MXE.<br /><br />I am not saying that this is what happened. But it is a definite possibility.<br />But than, It could be anything. For all we know, your dealer could have been putting drops of diesel in his bags to try and make &quot;sour diesel weed&quot;. (It would be funnier if i hadn&#039;t actually seen some kid try this)

				If you have an albuterol inhaler take it BEFORE doing anything that stresses your lungs (smoking). I usually get a little wheezy when hitting blunts or pieces, but having a tall cold drink and chilling out helps a ton. You might have to see a Pulmonologist if the problem persists for an extended period of time. Try to take slow smooth hits from the vape, then blow out smoothly. If you dont take huge hits and you have a drink nearby you should be OK. I would avoid pieces/bongs/blunts for now though. Also there&#039;s some great edibles on here that you should consider looking into.&nbsp; 8)
