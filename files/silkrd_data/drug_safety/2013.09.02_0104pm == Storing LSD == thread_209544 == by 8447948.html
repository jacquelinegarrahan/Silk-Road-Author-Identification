				Ive had a look and cant find any posts about storing acid. Im looking into different ways to store it both medium and long term... I know that for dry storage, it should be kept in a dark, dry place with little airflow?<br /><br />Can LSD be diluted into distilled water, or into alcohol for any length of time?

It can theoretically be kept in distilled water, but I don&#039;t know anyone who does. Usually it&#039;s in alcohol. So, removing light/heat is the key, hence wrapped up in the fridge is best. I couldn&#039;t tell you how long it&#039;d keep like that though.... I seriously doubt it&#039;d make that much difference if it&#039;s stored dry or in alcohol as what we are talking about is the deterioration of the molecule, but I&#039;m willing to hear other views if anyone has any evidence...

				Thank for the info, What if I was to store the acid in distilled water/alcohol in the dark place? I would be getting blotter so would it be ok to simply put the blotter in the bottle with the water/alcohol?

Nothing. You would end up with some in the liquid, maybe some on the blotter, and you&#039;d never know how much you&#039;re taking. If it&#039;s on a blotter, store the blotter dry, wrapped in foil, in a cold/dark place....

				I store LSD the same way I store everything else. Vacuum sealed and in the freezer. In the case of blotter, I put it in a fold of paper towel then vacuum sealed in food saver bags.<br /><br />I keep shrooms, LSD, and other various powders stored this way. Honestly the stuff will last forever.

				I like to store all LSD wrapped in aluminum foil to protect it from oxygen, then inside a ziploc for moisture protection, then in the freezer/fridge for temperature protection. This method has served me well for 20 years.<br /><br />SS

				I lost some acid that I hid when I was stoned. <br /><br />I found it 9 years later inside a CD cover.&nbsp; That CD was stored away from water but with no particular care. <br /><br />The acid was still potent. <br />

				Here&#039;s my method:<br /><br />Get a lot of tiny ziplock baggies and a proper air-tight GLASS jar (rubber seal, mason, or whatever).<br /><br />Cut up your blotter into units of whatever you expect to dose each time.<br /><br />Put each dose into a single or double layer of tiny ziplock and put these in the jar. You could probably do a layer of foil outside the baggies if you worry about the fridge light.<br /><br />Throw in some silica gel packs to absorb any moisture before it can seep through the plastic. They should have the color-change feature so you&#039;ll know if you ever need to change them.<br /><br />Then you can just take one dose out at a time, and you don&#039;t have to expose the rest of your tabs to the elements every time you want to get a dose.<br /><br />And I keep them in the fridge since my room is hot in the summer.<br /><br />This method has never failed me and gives me peace of mind.
