				I have read extensively and bought black tar to smoke it.&nbsp; Yet, I used a lightbulb vape and screwed up somehow because I could not even get a hit out of 150mg or so.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I just burned it even though i went slow as possible and what little smoke I did get I held in long as possible.&nbsp; I then mixed some tar in a&nbsp; spoon with water and snorted it, i got high off this but a ton dripped down my throat so I believe it is a waste.&nbsp; Any surefire ways to smoke black tar without totally wasting it?&nbsp; Sorry, no IV.&nbsp; i would buy #4 if I wanted to IV.

				Just use foil to vape the tar and a straw to inhale. That&#039;s what I used to do when smoked tar, always got me high

				Haven&#039;t had a chance to test it yet but the above poster says what a lot of others suggest for smoking it: just throw it on some foil, heat it from underneath, and suck through the straw.<br /><br />Good luck!

				yep use a straw and foil. Heat the foil first to &quot;prep&quot; it (burns off the chemicals used to treat the foil). Then put a small amount on the foil and heat from underneath while sucking the smoke through a straw. Put the tar at the top of your foil as it will run down as it vaporizes and you have to chase the smoke with your straw. You might waste a little bit getting the hang of it, but its easy and very effective. Enjoy.

				The visine bottle is an interesting tip.<br /><br />I have ended up using foil and a 1 liter bottle with the bottom cut off rather than a straw or bic pen tube because i was losing too much smoke.<br /><br />Now i would like to know is anal ingestion is a good method to use?.

				Anal ingestion is a funny way to put it :-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of experience with tar and both smoking and snorting are good methods. I do find snorting gets me higher than smoking but I love the ritual and taste of smoking tar. So, I usually do a bit of both.<br /><br />Smoking it will take a little time and practice to get down. I suggest using small pieces and trying to get it to &quot;run&quot; down the foil by tilting it when lighting it. The thing is you don&#039;t want to burn the tar but vaporize it. The first few hits will likely be clear &quot;vapor&quot; and as the rest of the non H heats up you&#039;ll get some actual smoke. Try bringing the lighter closer to the foil slowly until it starts sizzling. I use little strips of foil instead of squares so it&#039;s easier to know where to light. Also consider making a straw out of foil because the residue will collect on it and you can smoke it later.<br /><br />For snorting I use a spoon and a straw. Dissolve some tar in a bit of water and try to make it relatively concentrated but always keep your tolerance in mind. You can use a little heat to speed it up but it is not necessary with good tar. Heroin is very water soluble. Once you&#039;ve got it in solution, instead of snorting it like coke try this: dip your straw in the tar water and put your finger over the other side of the straw. Gravity and physics or whatever will make a bit of the solution stay in the other end of the straw. Now put the straw in your nose and touch your brain. Not really but get it in there good and let go as you snort. You want to keep it in your nasal passages and this will help because you&#039;re doing a little at a time. Go slow and when you&#039;re done you can snort a little bit of regular water after like ten-fifteen minutes. This will bring any sticky, viscous tar left in your nose into your nasal passages.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
