				after washing some local blow ( which was shit to begin with) I was left with more shit!!!<br />no numb whats so ever, no smell, no euphoria, nothings..<br /><br />so what common cuts make it though an acetone wash. I&#039;m positive its not any kind of speed, etc..<br /><br />I&#039;ve washed plenty of SR vendors C with good results.<br /><br />street product washed .5 returned .2 of who knows what but it isnt cocaine????<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched the clearnet and found no answer so far<br /><br />keep in mind this came from ghetto so its got to be some common easily available cut that acetone wont dissolve???

				Man there is really no way to tell. Most of the time the acetone will remove water in-solubles and such.&nbsp; Most synthetic cocaine or partly synthetic cocaine contain random water soluble cocaine-like highs..Usually stuff like mdppp, mdpv, naphyrone and more cocaine substitutions. So you probably removed most of the high from the &quot;cocaine&quot; with the acetone wash as these compounds are probably acetone soluble as well as water soluble. Did you save your acetone after your wash to evaporate? This will tell you a lot. Did you dry out your acetone first? Meaning did you remove any water content from your acetone or did you use lab grade acetone that contains no water? Hope you did because what little cocaine there might have been in your cocaine could have easily been stripped with water containing acetone.<br /><br />After your wash, your product probably looked shinny and&nbsp; more crystalline in nature than when you started. If the prodoct is super clean then your remaining crystals might be ALL cocaine (RARE) If your product is half clean, you might have a decent percentage of cocaine, with some other &quot;caines&quot; , and if your product is bunk, more than likly all remaining crystals are a mixture of anesthetic like Cocaine derivatives commonly used in VET practices or Dental practices..... lidocaine ,benzocaine, Procaine, Prilocaine, Novocaine...or just choose one of the many &quot;Caine&quot; research compounds out and about on the web and its probably in your&nbsp; &quot;cocaine&quot;. And they arnt gonna get you high at all...<br /><br />So all in all, if your cocaine is synthetic cocaine, you might be removing the synthetic high with the acetone. And what you got left over is the numbing aspect to the fake cocaine, or the eye candy aspect to the fake cocaine to look like fishscale when its not.<br /><br />I take my crystals which usually contain 25-50 % cocaine hcl, and 50-75 % &quot;caine&quot; cuts and I use baking soda to basify the crystals. This slow reactions compared to ammonia allows me to use the fact that these &quot;caine&quot; cuts act different as oils, then they do as crystals. I can use there weight property, color and miscibility to separate the Cocaine Oil from the &quot;Caine&quot; oils. I then take my Cocaine freebase and either smoke it or return the Cocaine back to Cocaine HCL with deluted hydrochloric acid and evaporate...And wash with acetone again if I used to much acid. <br /><br /><br />ps..a wash i did a couple days ago, when evaporated contained a yellow substance that smells horrible like cocaine but was not at all. So keep in mind, crazy cocaine smelling cocaine doesnt mean shit anymore. The only way to truly know what your getting anymore is hitting the kitchen with it. But hey, who says you cant learn a little chemistry in the middle of a binge, right?<br /><br />Hope this helps<br />It really depends on the nature of the cocaine on how to get the most out of it. <br /><br />

				yes used chemical grade acetone<br />after wash didnt get any shiny appearance like&nbsp; when I&#039;ve washed from vendors here.<br />looked same as before.<br />before wash it has a numbing effect, and caine like taste<br />after wash, no numb at all, no taste at all?<br /><br />either way the shit is bunk. little to no effect before wash and no effect after wash

				I&#039;ve done the acetone wash a few times with good results.&nbsp; The mystery product your speaking of might be contaminants dissolved into it from improper labware?&nbsp; Did the acetone come in contact with any plastics?&nbsp; <br />I also wanted to get your guy&#039;s opinion on a water wash method I&#039;ve been playing with.&nbsp; After I have the acetone washed product, I measure it carefully, then using just enough distilled water, I dissolve the cocaine substance.&nbsp; Now if hypothetically, it&#039;s half levamisole/half cocaine hcl, then using just enough DI H2O to dissolve the cocaine, should leave you with appx 90% cocaine product.&nbsp; This is assuming that the solubilities of the two assumed starting reagents hold true and cocaine will dissolve about 10x more readily in H2O than Levamisole.&nbsp; I&#039;m aware of azeotropes from previous distillations I&#039;ve dealt with so I&#039;m interested if anyone has experience with this.&nbsp; After dissolving the cocaine/leva with H2O, I then decant the clear solution into a pyrex dish and place in the freezer.&nbsp; After a few freeze/thaw cycles, crystals will start to appear.&nbsp; These crystals are scraped onto a mirror, dried, powderized and snorted.&nbsp; The results were a very nice and smooth euphoric rush.&nbsp; Thanks for your commentary for ways I can improve on this method.&nbsp; Of course a 2nd H2O wash should theoretically anyways improve the final product to 99%.&nbsp;

				Yep, you could call it a water wash or a water recrystalization. These washing methods work exactly the same for mdma as they do cocaine.
