				Title: <strong>Ketamine</strong><br />

				Hey all! So, my drug experience up until now has been with mdma and the psychedelics. But I&#039;ve always been curious about ketamine, with the k-hole sounding particularly interesting to explore. So I got myself a gram to try.<br /><br />Being a cautious sort I snorted a small bump of about 30mg to start with. Now this is the first time in my life I&#039;ve done ketamine, or indeed snorted anything up my nose, but I think I did it right. I had another bump about 20 minutes later... and the predominant feeling is drunkenness without the nausea.<br /><br />Like, the room is utterly spinning, my fingertips are numb typing on the keyboard, and I&#039;m feeling very floaty. It&#039;s lacking any mood uplift, mental change, or trippyness that I recognise from psychedelics, and is really just a sort of mild confusion mixed with being very very drunk and a bit numb.<br /><br />This normal for a low dose of K?<br /><br />If so, awesome... means I&#039;ve got K and am snorting it right. Though slightly disappointing there&#039;s no depth to it at this level. There anything interesting about ketamine except for the k-hole? Do people enjoy it at low doses just for the drunk-without-nausea effect or does it do more for other people than it&#039;s doing for me?

				i find low doses of ketamine to be very relaxing and slightly euphoric with some inebriation. the more you do, the more psychedelic it gets. i k-holed for the first time recently and i can&#039;t recommend it enough. it&#039;s a completely different trip.

				Normal for low doses. Wait 1-3 days, then try a 75mg line. No hole, but significant intoxication and familiarization with the chemical.

				Since there is experience with this drug and psychedelics would someone be willing to explain the difference?&nbsp; I read the part about feeling drunk without nauseous but is there anything more to Ketamine that would be worth trying it? <br /><br />Much appreciated.

				i k-holed my first time on it, and it was a bit too much, but still pretty damn fun.<br /><br />never really did that much again, but it&#039;s pretty much exactly as you describe it -- i even tell people who want to try it that it&#039;s like the intoxicated feeling of having drank 20 beers without anything in your stomach.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re right that you&#039;ve basically explored all there is to explore.... maybe get stuck in a k-hole here and there, but the most fun I&#039;ve had was just snorting a bunch all night with friends and hanging out.&nbsp; It can take a party to a whole new kind of weird.

But the lovely stuff on the Road, from the likes of Reich &amp; Marcel, I&#039;m finding 250 maybe a bit much (beginning and end fine, but hazy awareness of the center) so using your scale I should maybe aim a bit lower, being 170 lbs. It&#039;s really disappointing tho, to aim for a hole and not get there, being as you&#039;ve only got the one shot on each occasion...<br /><br />I find stims help to push me through nicely. Any other ideas for combos/pre-dosing?
