				I haven&#039;t taken any drugs for about 10 years. So now I have 7g dried cubensis and 2g good crystal MDMA and I&#039;m going to an open air psytrance rave next weekend. I am early 40s and somewhat prone to depression and anxiety. I have had good and bad mushroom trips, but always had a positive reaction to MDMA. This may be my last drugs blowout ever, due to work commitments, so I want to go out with a bang, but I also don&#039;t want to blow it by having a bad time. WHAT WOULD YOU DO????????????????? Any advice, with details, timings etc much appreciated

				I am younger than you, but according to what I have seen MDMA will be good, but the hangover will be terrible.<br />About the shrooms, it depends a lot of your mood at the moment of the trip.<br /><br />Anyway, how long is this rave? 7g of shrooms and 2g of mdma is a huge amount for one person. I would try eating 2g of shrooms, if you feel comfortable like 2h after, maybe another gram and 0.1 of mdma (depending on your weight). If not, you can always wait a little more, if you are like 5 hours on just shrooms and then you take mdma it will be nice too.<br /><br />That should be a nice and strong experience, since you haven&#039;t got any tolerance. But if the rave lasts for days, think that if you take shrooms one day, the day after you&#039;d take 3 times the qty in order to get the same effects, so it is a really bad idea to take shrooms 2 days in a row. But if you are proper to depression and anxiety, I would be very careful about that. Maybe it is too much... I dont know.<br /><br />For the hangover of mdma I recommend you eating a lot of bananas the week before, and some 5-htp after in order to increase your serotonin.<br /><br />Hope I helped and you understood me, I know my english sucks...

				I wouldnt take the shrooms if youre going to a rave, the MDMA will be good but you only need about .2g <br />and then if youre up for it shrooms after you get home or the next day/weekend. for that take 3grams.<br />And dont take the MDMA until you get there, the come up can seem like a long time but you dont wanna be sittin in a car drivin around for it.<br />.2g of that will last for the whole rave but maybe youd want to re-dose after about 5+ hours if youre there that long.

				Jedi flip at a rave? I would candyflip instead, but if you&#039;re a shroomhead then maybe all is well. I don&#039;t personally find random frenetic activity amongst strangers all that conducive to a shroom trip.

				Thanks for this great advice. You kinda confirmed what I was thinking, that shrooms might not agree with me at a rave, even with some MDMA in me. The main thing I spose, is that I want to just have a nice time, so I don&#039;t particularly need to go on a mental one. However, I would&#039;ve liked to trip out a bit for the visuals, but I don&#039;t want to risk spinning out and just hiding in my tent, waiting for it all to be over (Which has happened before) I never heard of &#039;Jedi-flipping&#039; before, although I am aware of hippy flipping and candy flipping. I would&#039;ve liked to do some acid, but it lasts too long and I know I&#039;d get fed up of it after a few hours if it wasn&#039;t going great. I&#039;m interested to hear Oldtoby would prefer to candyflip. Is there a general consensus that shrooms are scarier than acid? I would say so from my experience. Maybe that&#039;s where the &#039;Jedi&#039; part comes in???? Anyway, it&#039;s decided. I&#039;m just gonna get totally nutted on MDMA, get friendly with some folks, dance my ass off and have a night of bliss

				Nice, if you want to have some visuals you can try 2c-b (between ecstasy and lsd, about 4-6h)

				Jedi-flip = shrooms + MDMA<br />candyflip = LSD + MDMA<br /><br />or at least that&#039;s the terminology I was taught - maybe hippyflip is the same? <br /><br />Not super experienced in these combos (because I&#039;m new-ish to MDMA, not the hallucinogens) but I find shroom trips generally to be a little antisocial or perhaps more accurately (very) selectively social, whereas LSD is far more anything goes. My first Jedi-flip I thought I would similarly be in a party going mood. Instead, I picked up a 1000 MILE STARE, became super-lucid, sombre, serious, and philosophical, and just wanted to write for hours. I guess that&#039;s where the Jedi part comes in. A party was not had! (it was cool, but not what I was going for)<br /><br />Anyways, sounds like you&#039;re going to have a great time. I&#039;m jealous! Have fun. :)
