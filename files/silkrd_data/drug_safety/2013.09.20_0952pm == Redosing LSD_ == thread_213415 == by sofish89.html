				If i took a tab about 3 hours ago can i take another tab? is there a problem with tolerance, and will the 2nd tab affect me at all?<br />And what if i wait several hours (7 or 8 hours after the first tab) and take 3 or 4 tabs, will i trip hard from them?

				I took 30µg and 60µg does at my first time over hours. It took ages to get me above the threshold. It wasn&#039;t bad though. I would take 1-2 blotters. If you took one 3 hours ago then sure why not take a second one? Just don&#039;t wait too long. 7-8 hours after the initial dose is not a good idea IMHO. But if you take 3-4 tabs then sure you will trip hard, what else is suppose to happen?<br /><br />I would just take another one, or even two. Or if you took some like 10 hours ago wait one or a few days. Get one sleep, you don&#039;t want to be super tired when tripping.

				Tolerance sets in pretty quickly, builds until you come down, and dissipates over two weeks.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to redose you&#039;ll want to do it within the first hour or so.&nbsp; After that point you will run into diminishing returns.&nbsp; Dosing the day after you tripped is generally a waste of acid.&nbsp; Spacing it out every other day will be fine for a couple of days but you won&#039;t trip as hard as the first day without increasing your dose.&nbsp; All tolerance is cumulative.

				In my experience redosing may reset the duration of a trip(have had 20+ hour trips through redosing) but it will not increase the effect.<br /><br />You want to wait 2 weeks since your last dose and then take the full amount you want to do all at once.
