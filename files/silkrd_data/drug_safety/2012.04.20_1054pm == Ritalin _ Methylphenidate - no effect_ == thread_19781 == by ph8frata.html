				Soo.. my friend recently acquired pakistanian &quot;Rital&quot; Methylphenidate. He wanted to use it just for studying, and has never tried any stimulants but caffine. He is very light, 55kg. So on the first day he tried 5mg, no effect. Then on the try he did 10 mg, no effect. On the next day he tried 15mg and again no effect. Absolutely no noticable effect, pupils in norm, heartbeat in norm, can&#039;t feel anything different from usual.<br /><br />Do you think that he might have bought fake pills or he is &quot;immune&quot;?

				I don&#039;t think you can be immune to Ritalin. They are probably just weak or fake pills.<br />Increase the dose to be sure. The prescribing information says some patients might need 40 to 60 mg a day.

I&#039;m just surprised because the seller is high in top sellers and had lots and lots of positive feedback, can&#039;t really accuse him of bad intentions

				That&#039;s not a very high dose if he was looking to really &quot;feel&quot; something. I find ADHD medications to have a really subtle effect until I get to high doses (in which case they usually just become uncomfortable). Sometimes they even make me feel sleepy (but with an inability to sleep) and I&#039;m 100% sure the stuff I have tried is real. People can have completely different reactions to the stuff (like all drugs). <br /><br />But was he able to sleep on the 15mg (within a few hours of taking it)? That would be kind of unusual.

				You build up a tolerance to methylphenidate fast...it&#039;s good for a day at best. I took it for a year since it is the only thing I could get prescribed in my country. <br />Honestly, it didn&#039;t really help. Made my vision blurry and made me feel like crap overall. Just buy some speed, check out Der Speed Doktor&#039;s sale, 5g for 10 BTC absolute bargain!
