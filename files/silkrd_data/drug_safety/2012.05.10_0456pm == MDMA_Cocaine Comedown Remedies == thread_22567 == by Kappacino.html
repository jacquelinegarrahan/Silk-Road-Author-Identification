				I&#039;m thinking about upgrading to vendor status and selling my personal mdma/coke remedies, just want to see if anyone is actually interested first. Doesn&#039;t completely remove the comedown but they definitely help ALOT (personally I tend to do alternate MDMA/coke nights when I&#039;m partying and without these I probably couldn&#039;t handle it). I&#039;ve been taking these for a while and the ingredients are tailored to counteract the particular deficiencies and specific maladies associated with each drug. (aka I dun didz the research nigga)<br /><br />The MDMA capsules contain:<br /><br />5-HTP<br />Vitamin C<br />Grape Seed Extract<br />Ginkgo Biloba <br />Sulbutiamine (B1 derivative)<br />L-Tyrosine<br /><br />Cocaine:<br /><br />L-tyrosine<br />Vitamin C<br />Melatonin <br />Kyolic Extract<br />Calcium Carbonate<br />Vitamin B-100<br />Bilberry Extract<br /><br /><br />Prices would be something like:<br /><br />5 Capsules - $8.75 (£5.50)<br />10 - $16 (£10)<br />25 - $37.50 (£23)<br />50 - $70 (£43)<br /><br />Let me know if you would be interested. Free samples will be coming in the next few weeks if the demand is there.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yes! Yet another great thread on harm reduction!&nbsp; :)<br />I bet if you included that, and had maybe a note of when to take them might be good as well. ie. 1 before, 1 after druge use?<br />Followed by a good nights rest.

I don&#039;t pre-load with the MDMA capsules cause I&#039;m not a fan of digesting 5-HTP until the MD has kicked in.<br /><br />But with the cocaine ones you could just take one at the end of the night before you hit the deck. That will help a lot, I&#039;ve never tried taking one beforehand as well but I&#039;ll try it out next time and see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />And then a wank (seriously it helps with the re-uptake of neurotransmitters), some fruit, OJ, and hit the deck. And then some fatty food in morning, and some light exercise (weights/jog/stretching). <br /><br />That combo seems to all but obliterate comedowns for me, and removes completely the grogginess/depression you can get from taking mdma (especially) and coke. The first time I did pills I felt like death for 2 days after.<br /><br />But yeah I dunno how much demand there would be for these. Tryptamine&#039;s (sr vendor) mind food (which is brilliant for MDMA) seem to sell well, yet he prefers to market as nootropics - but I suppose I could undercut him in terms of price. His stuff is incredible though. But as far as I know he doesn&#039;t have a specific remedy for cocaine, and his prices are slightly too high for my wallet. Hopefully he wont mind some competition in this market&nbsp; :)

				Ok well I guess I&#039;m willing to lose the 30btc vendor fee and take a risk on this.<br /><br />Should be up and running in 2-3 weeks. Will update with free samples when the listings go up.

				I always find that the best cures are orange juice, vitamin C and wanking lol. <br /><br />Cool idea to sell these though. Very original idea. Kudos. :)

Anyone can just buy them and put it together themselves if they want to go that route. But luckily most people are lazy and can&#039;t be bothered/afford to bulk buy - I feel that this is an affordable alternative without having to do anything yourself to compile everything together.<br /><br />And thanks Lim. That&#039;s a truly classic combo you listed there.
