				Be careful <br />It&#039;s quite dangerous, if you know the real dosage of the blotters, don&#039;t take more than 3mg<br />I haven&#039;t taken DOC but DOB, I guess, yet I&#039;m not sure, it has similar dosage and duration, for me, DOB took much long to start feeling it, more than one hour, and couldn&#039;t sleep until 20 since the effects kicked in.<br /><br />Be careful, I found it much hardcore.

				DOC Is one of my favorites of all time, but it lasted incredibly long. I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking more than a single blotter until you&#039;ve experienced it. Even if you don&#039;t feel the trip coming on, I didn&#039;t get the effects for almost 3 hours after taking it (bucally), so I wouldn&#039;t recommend you redose no matter what. The lack of sleep has a preponderance to induce quasi-psychotic symptoms, so you might want to be on the lookout for that... Having some sleeping pills on hand for if you can&#039;t fall asleep at the 24-hour point might be a good idea.

				DOC fucks your mind. I took it on blotter paper and it tasted like straight butt. Nassssty. (Ack! that just made me remember how it tasted) <br /><br />Did that shit for a week straight tho. I prefer Lucy. Most of my buddies that are use to taking Lucy didn&#039;t like the DOC. They had bad trips that were hard for them to control.&nbsp; The trip is just not the same to me. It seems more generic. lol considering it is.<br /><br />But enjoy your DOC.

I think they might be life-savers at that point when you can&#039;t fall asleep. It really depends on how much is on each blotter, though; if you can find that out, you might be able to predict a little more accurately what your experience will be like.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14420.msg142399#msg142399">Quote from: Dr Special K on March 08, 2012, 03:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">DOC fucks your mind.

I prefer Lucy as well, but that&#039;s a generic statement. There are still some situations in which I think DOC would be more appropriate than anything else, and there are certain qualities of it that I valued more about it than anything else.

After you get the picture of DOC you should try 2 hits. I assure you wont sleep that night lol. I was in my room staring at my ceiling fan light.

				LOL @ &quot;After the week I didn&#039;t feel normal for awhile.&quot;&nbsp; .. No kidding? :) <br /><br />From reading your posts I gather you&#039;d be able to answer this question from personal experience (Weirdos and Insomniacs, Unite! :-D )&nbsp; ... Plus, you know, you&#039;re a doctor.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, this : how does something like that kind of Psychonautical Heroism compare to just plain ol&#039; staying awake for that long? People have told me DOC keeps them awake WAY more than LSD (and I&#039;ve seen people take LSD once and stay up an entire weekend and go to work on Monday morning - no sleep til Monday night! Protein pills + helmet, check.). <br /><br /><br />(PS... is there an adjective form of psychonaut..? I could&#039;ve said &quot;astral&quot; I suppose but that&#039;s no fun!)<br /><br />(Pre-posting Edit - &quot;astronautical&quot; is a word indeed, so I win at Scrabble. &quot;Qat&quot; ftw! [it&#039;s a bush!])

I would sit there and try to fall asleep for hours and all I could hear in my head was a song that I listened to over and over and over again. I swear that song was like 10 minutes long and I know ever little beat because of that night. That was off 2 hits. <br /><br />Binging on DOC has its ups and downs. But I suppose that goes for all Psychedelics. Ever since my bad trip on that shit I havent even touched it. But Ketamine on that bad trip made it all better&nbsp; ;D Ketamine + LSD or DOC = &lt;3<br /><br />But anyway My sleep Sched. Was wayyy fucked up after that. And my nogin kinda hurt. lol DOC lasts a good, ohh, id say 20 hours. And tripping your balls off in the middle of the night in the dark is fuckin&#039; weird. I dont think I could stay up for days sober. thats forsure.

As I looked at the page, all of the words would be color-coded in different ways. For example, it would start off with all 1-letter words being blue, all 2-letter words being green, etc. Then, as I read, they would change according to the context. ie, the words blue or sky would be blue, unless the passage later said that the sky was dark, when the word would turn black.<br /><br />It really didn&#039;t add anything to the work I was reading, but more than anything else I thought it was cool that my brain could subconsciously do that fantastic work. It kinda made me wonder if I can&#039;t train my brain to automatically do other cool things.

You can teach your brain to do all sorts of neat things. You may already know this but the phenomenon of crossed senses is called synesthesia. It happens a lot on psychedelics but there are also people who have it all the time. I&#039;ve met a fair number of them (I sought them out for reasons I&#039;d rather not go into) and believe it or not a lot of them can experience it as distressing, or at the very least distracting. This is especially the case when it is something that starts later in life, vs. something that they are born with.<br /><br />The phenomenon you are describing is actually a relatively common one. <br /><br />There are tons of ways to train your brain to do amazing things but you just touched on a good place to start - do some research on synesthesia, specifically what people do to try to get rid of it. Then do that in reverse! It&#039;s way more complicated than that, of course, but it can be done - I wouldn&#039;t be able to read music if I hadn&#039;t trained my brain to read color and sound at the same time on a musical staff.<br /><br />&lt;3 brains ..... They&#039;re always doing cool stuff! ///hugs my skull/// :)

				never done DOC, but DOB lasted much too long to be pleasurable for me. some people might like tripping all fucking day, but for me the insomnia gets to a point where i am literally begging the gods of psychedelia to let me sleep. the relentless pounding of bizarre circular thoughts makes me feel quite suicidal. after experimenting with longer-lasting psychedelics, ive ultimately decided in the future i will only take shorter acting compounds. even LSD is a little too long and draining for me nowadays.<br /><br />sawyer
