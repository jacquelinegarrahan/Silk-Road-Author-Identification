				Why would you want to do that? Adderall is much better when taken, and I&#039;ve found that simply using it as it is intended is much better than doing too much.<br /><br />But, there are many companies that manufacture amphetamine salts, and it is likely that all of their pills are different, some containing more filler to prevent extraction and some containing more. Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture, by Uncle Fester, has some extraction methods suggestions for ephedrine that you may be able to apply to Adderall, but you may just ruin the pills too.<br /><br />If you have pills to waste, you may simply try an old-fashion &quot;wash&quot; with some type of solvent, like Toluene, Rubbing Alcohol (90%) or Coleman camper fuel, using a funnel and some lab-grade filters or doubled-up coffee filters. Don&#039;t use water, because pill filler is designed not to be soluble in water.<br /><br />Good luck, and remember I would just keep the Adderall as it is, because I don&#039;t think shooting it up or snorting it accomplishes much.
