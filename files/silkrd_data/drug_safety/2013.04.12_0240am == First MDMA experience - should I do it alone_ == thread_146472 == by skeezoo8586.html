				There&#039;s a concert tomorrow night that I have been looking forward to for a while. I bought some MDMA for this event but it looks like the only person I can trust as a sitter won&#039;t be there and I&#039;m nervous about doing the molly by myself. I could go see the show sober, and probably enjoy it but it seems like the perfect chance to try out MDMA. I&#039;ve tried 6apb and 4-mmc before but never MDMA. I had a good time and stayed in control on 6apb but I have had experiences I regret on 4-mmc by going overboard. I feel nervous because I don&#039;t know how it will effect will me but I also want to make the experience special and be responsible and avoid consequences.

Do you mean going to the rave and doing it without anybody you know? Or doing it completely alone, by yourself?<br /><br />If you mean the second- Fuck no! If it&#039;s real MDMA you absolutely NEED people to interact with, talk with, hug- at the very least friends online. It is probably the worst drug to do in isolation.

				Umm my suggestion would be if you&#039;re gonna take it by yourself and you&#039;re a guy, then take a lower end dose. Maybe 100-120 mg so that you aren&#039;t rolling face with strangers and you&#039;ll be able to manage yourself. Make a booster dose if you think you might want to add more to the roll while you&#039;re there. :)

You should be fine.<br /><br />MDMA isn&#039;t acid or some other hardcore psychedelic. I don&#039;t think you need someone to trip sit you for mdma. Unless your prone to irrational decisions while under the influence of drugs. And unless you ingest several hundred mgs then you should be able to maintain the ability to control yourself, you should be fine.<br /><br />MDMA is a sociable drug, so in my opinion the more the merrier. Like with most drugs the setting your in makes all the difference. If your at a concert you probably won&#039;t be the only one there on some substances. Its always interesting that you are drawn to others who are of an elevated consciousness. You&#039;ll see someone make eye contact and you know that they know your both on something. <br /><br />Also always make sure you test your pill / cap. Take the extra time to know what your putting in your body. And do your best to take the proper precautions to reduce the neurotoxic effects of the MDMA on your mind. <br /><br />

				One thing I should mention about doing MDMA in a group is you&#039;ll want to fuck anyone and everyone, albeit you&#039;ll likely experience erectile dysfunction too; so practice exercising some self control if you&#039;re going to be around people who&#039;ll give you icky STIs or you don&#039;t want to fuck.

Over heating also seems to increase the likelihood as well. So keep as cool as possible. Your gonna want to dance all night long, but keep in control and keep it cool. Take frequent breaks, rehydrate ect ect. But don&#039;t drink too much water either. <br /><br />Having some gatorade on hand helps with dehydration as well as gives you an influx of electrolytes. You can take supplements with Magnesium for the bruxism ( teeth grinding ). Having high antioxident foods before and after your roll help as well. Vitamin C! <br /><br />Just read through that entire thread. Lots of good information. You&#039;ll learn a lot and save your mind some difficulties in the future. Be safe and smart! And enjoy your first roll! :D <br /><br />

If you don&#039;t have to figure everything out by yourself it would be pretty simple. <br /><br />To skeezoo hope you have fun, my first time with molly was really something.

				I mean, from my perspective finding SR was relatively easy. But having helped people as young as in their early forties figure out how to wake up a computer by shaking the mouse... and knowing an IT friend who had to help a PROGRAMMER do the same...<br /><br />I&#039;m skeptical on the degree to which the average human is intelligent.

I grew up with computers and have a good amount of technical experience in a lot of things computer related. Once I figured out this place existed it was just a lot of reading to make sure I knew what I was doing. Getting BTC took me the longest, just because I wanted to be sure I made the jump correctly. <br /><br />Back to the logical thinker thing, I find it tempting in many situations to consider myself &quot;smarter&quot; than many of my peers, because I think I handle many situations sooooo much better than them. In some cases this is probably true. But than, these people excel in areas where I come up short so I guess we all need each other :] Not trying to argue, just adding.

				i think you can give it a try alone - but with LOW DOSE... i would suggest 50mg in a capsule and when not enough 30mg through nose (can be little painful but not that much)<br /><br />for timing keep in mind that it may take up to 60 minutes until first effects. this depends on how empty your stomage is, if you have a good meal before 60 -80 minutes, on emtpy stomage it might be 40-60 minutes.<br /><br />of course through nose it is better timable because it is within minutes...

				So I got to the show and the opening DJ was pretty good, there lots of people dancing and I felt at home. All the nervousness I&#039;ve had leading up to the event and about whether or not I should take the molly and everything that could go wrong was all gone. So I left and went home to grab a 140mg capsule I got from Aidoneus here on SR. <br />I got back to the venue a little before the main event. I didn&#039;t notice a comeup, but I&#039;ve never danced like that in my life! Sleep was easy, It felt pretty amazing to lay still in a warm bed and let my mind drift. I feel great today. <br /><br />In retrospect 140mg might be a light to threshold dose for me because I am a BIG guy. I&#039;ve seen dosing tables that are based on bodyweight that would call for a higher dose. Granted I&#039;ve got a clean bill of health, physically but I have been on psych meds before which might (hopefully not) interfere with the effects of MDMA. I think next time, which probably won&#039;t be anytime soon, I&#039;ll add something like 60mg of MDA to mix and see how that shakes things up.<br /><br />All in all a grand experiment!

Did you feel excessively thirsty, get a try mouth, and grind your teeth? If not I presume your drug interfered with the MDMA or you really do need a gigantic dose. That, or it wasn&#039;t real stuff.

If not I presume your drug interfered with the MDMA or you really do need a gigantic dose. That, or it wasn&#039;t real stuff.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I try to stay pretty hydrated and took some brakes to drink water when I got dry mouth, It was during the water breaks and then on the way home that I noticed the &quot;buzz&quot; the rest of the time i was just kinda lost in dancing. I also took 250mg of magnesium chelate to avoid teeth grinding and muscle cramps. I didn&#039;t overheat, but I was lightly sweating.<br />The med I take now is buspar, 10mg twice a day and <br />this link:<br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=56497<br />is the only credible looking report on buspar/mdma combo<br />i can relate to the person reporting a &quot;cascade&quot; or re-living of effects when they took their regular dose of buspar the next day. it&#039;s two days after, now, and this morning i felt like the sunshine and every color i was seeing was somehow extra bright and a little magical. I was feeling a heightened sense of love spending the day with my family. Maybe it was all placebo. I know that a few years ago I had to take 250-350mgs of methylone to really get anywhere, anything less and I wouldn&#039;t feel a thing. That held to be true for a couple of different batches.<br />I will probably send off one of the capsules I got from Aidoneus to ecstasydata.org when I can work the fee for that into my budget.

				Hi Skeezoo,<br />Did you get around to sending some of our stuff to get tested?<br /><br />This showed up recently over there:<br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2789<br /><br />Thing is we don&#039;t ship in clear capsules. Nor do we ship a capsule with 90mg in it... ever.<br />Perhaps whoever sent it just sent some from our capsule in a new one? Not sure.<br /><br />Results are good, though.. take it as you will.<br />.Whish.<br />
