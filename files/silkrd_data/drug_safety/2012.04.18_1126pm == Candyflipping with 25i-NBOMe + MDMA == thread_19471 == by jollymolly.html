				I just got some 25i this week off SR and it is a bit different than LSD but has anyone tried candyflipping with it? Just curious to see what that would be like and if anyone here has done it. I smoked some weed towards the end of my 25i trip and it was another totally different experience.

				Yes, people have taken it in combination with MDMA.&nbsp; The general consensus is that this is a dangerous combination, due to the vasoconstriction from 25i-NBOMe and the stimulant effects from MDMA.&nbsp; Some people are fine, but others have said that if they were at a festival, they probably would have ended up in the emergency room.&nbsp;

				A bit offtopic I know, but has anyone tried a honey-candyflip (2C-B, LSD, MDMA)? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking of giving it a go this summer. My plan would be to start out with acid, wait maybe 4 hours and then eat the molly and then another 2 hours for the nexus. I usually trip for 10-12 hours from LSD, 6-8 from 2C-B and 3-5 from MDMA. I would probably be munching on edible cannabis products as well, since I absolutely loved eating hash + acid and hash + 2C-B.

				I tried this combo, and while it was extremely pleasurable I could definitely see some issues arising if you were out movin&#039; and shakin&#039;.&nbsp; I was at home just listening to music and I was getting warm and my heart rate was up a little more than normal.<br />I also kept the doses purposely low; 100mg MDMA and 750mic&#039;s NBOMe and I&#039;m good size @ 6&#039; 220lb.<br />I probably won&#039;t try it again but I do hope to hippy flip this weekend ;D<br /><br />I just loaded a cap with 140 of Ivory&#039;s crystals and 17mg 2C-B. Should be a good time ;D

				Thanks guys. I usually do my drugs at shows so I guess I&#039;ll have to stay away from this one.

				I&#039;m gonna try the honey-candyflip this weekend, double drop sid, 2 - 3 hrs - 35mg Nexus, 2 - 3 hrs - .1g Molly, 1hr - .05 Molly!<br /><br />Of course once I&#039;ve actually flipped sid, ALL bets are off and I probably won&#039;t get far from my couch... but the spirit is strong!

				Try snorting 1.5mg to 2.5mg of 25D-NBOMe... it&#039;s very similar to MDMA or MDA, but with intense visuals.

				No, 25I isn&#039;t very much like MDMA. I am talking about 25D which is a very short acting entactogenic chem, whereas 25I is a long lasting LSD-like chem.

				As 328502E said, don&#039;t do it. Not only you are stressing your heart, jaw clenching and muscle tension would be really bad.

				Obviously some people seem to have problems but I haven&#039;t. I&#039;ve done this on numerous occasions and have worked my way through too much 25i and molly to say i&#039;ve ever had any detrimental effects. The only negative effects are ones I&#039;ve also gotten from 25i by itself and weren&#039;t any worse while rolling. I&#039;d say go for it but keep the 25i to a moderately low dose. It&#039;s a fucking blast. Everything in moderation, friends...

				Yeah if I were at a show/fest when I combined it would have been ugly. When the MDMA was really kicking in, my heart was racing a mile a minute. Thankg god my dog was there to calm me down.

I believe I was in the beginning stages of a panic attack. Luckily I (my dog) was able to catch it and helped smooth me out.
