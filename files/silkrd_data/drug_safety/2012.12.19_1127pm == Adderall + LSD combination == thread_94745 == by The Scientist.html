				i can vouch for doing dexidrine and L, and preludin and L, they are both pharmaceutical amphtmne so i would assume if you partake responsibly all should go well.

				I posted this in your other thread:<br /><br />Methamphetamine (20-40 mg, i.v.) partially inhibited the effects of LSD when it was given after the start of LSD action. It also shortened the duration of action of LSD to 2-3 h, and modified the LSD-induced perceptual changes and disturbances in spatial-temporal orientation. The subjects became more open to the researchers and their actions were more related to reality than on LSD alone. However, Hoch (1955, 1956b) gave no exact details about the subjects and the experimental design.<br /><br />Balestirieri (1957) gave amphetamine (20-30 mg, i.v.) to subjects at the height of LSD activity (open, n=8,200ug, p.o.). The effects of both substances were intensified, but not qualitatively modified, accoridng to his observations. <br /><br />Ritalin is a sympathomimetic drug related to the amphetamines. It was used from 1954 to support psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD (Sandison &amp; Whitelaw, 1957; Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963). ...<br /><br />In combination with LSD, ritalin caused, 15 min after i.m. injection, perceptual changes with withdrawal tendencies, distortion of the surroundings, and augmented mental activity. Changes in body image and proprioception were noted, as were changes in mood anf effect. Ritalin modified the LSD effects and allowed the application of lowered doses in LSD in therapy (Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963).<br /><br />In the course of 370 LSD sessions, Kristensen (1962) additionally gave 23 seriously neurotic patents methylphenidate (Ritalin, 30-50mg, i.v.) during 220 sessions. Methylphenidate was administered additively at the height of the LSD effect (150ug, p.o.). The two substances supported each other in their effects. The author developed the hypothesis that LSD caused a process of successively augmented tension, which was discharged by methylphenidate administration. Ling and Buckman (1963) gave methylphenidate 30 min after LSD and observed a reduction of LSD-induced anxiety. Leuner (1981) described the same effects as those described by Ling and Buckman (1963) and Kristenen (1962), based on many years of clinical experience with combination treatment using LSD and methylphenidate. Methylphenidate was administered when the LSD effect began to wane.<br /><br />From Pharmacology of LSD: A Critical Review by Annelie Hintze, pages 119 to 120.

				It would likely kick your mind into overdrive, which might be good and might be bad. Keep the stimulant dose low so you can avoid stimulant psychosis. Be safe and start light!

				Its 100% safe but its really almost necessary to have some xanax. You will be up forever unless you have powerful sleeping pills.

				Hmm i didn&#039;t combine them, but i did use meth on the comedown of LSD. It helped pick me back up and get rid of that sluggish feeling. How was it mixing them? I would imagine some serious vasoconstriction.

				I have done rit/add and shrooms at the same time.&nbsp; :o&nbsp; it was great time esp if you are use to addies.&nbsp; acidhead good look on the research.&nbsp; Keep in mind depending on how much of each you do run the risk of over stimulating an acid trip.&nbsp; Not saying that is a bad thing, just that it isn&#039;t always good.&nbsp;

Have done cid after speed, while still on speed and speed during a trip (once - didn&#039;t notice anything btw). Done countless times. After speed I always notice that I don&#039;t wanna move (d&#039;oh :P), while on speed I never noticed much of a difference besides slightly less visuals and more &quot;focused&quot; optics. Low dose amph shouldn&#039;t be a problem at all. I prefer not to mix them though.<br /><br />I also tried coke and mdma on acid, both gave subjectively no effects at all.
