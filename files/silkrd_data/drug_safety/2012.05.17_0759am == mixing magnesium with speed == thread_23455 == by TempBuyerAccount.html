				1. Don&#039;t cut drugs. Selling some barely-stronger-than-coffee mixtures is what gives speed its bad name.<br /><br />2. Bigger amounts of magnesium can act as a laxative.

I know, but to much caffeine makes ppl hyper so i wanna do a mix of caffeine and magnesium to minimize both bad effects.

				locally it doesnt matter if you have 10% or 70% so thats why i choose to cut it and make more money. But back to my initial question:<br /><br />What kind of magnesium is used for cutting? Sulfate, Citrate or an other kind?

				Trying to find a neutral flavoured one will be hard, everyone&#039;ll cry about the stinging and the weird...&quot;sniff sniff&quot; pineappley smell...<br /><br />I&#039;m a fan of not cutting it, but if you&#039;re in it to turn some coin, that&#039;s dealing lesson #6 i think, cutting agents and quantities. Limit will have a better idea, he&#039;s got his Phd, I&#039;m just an undergrad!

				Is it the stuff you mix with water and drink before bed or with brekky? If it is, salt runs better up the nose!<br /><br />I used to get cramps, went to the doc and he said run some mag, I got the powder, mixed it up and after the first drink i thought &quot;Hey... if this shit rails ok, that&#039;d be awesome! A nice pineapple smell to go with your geek or charlie! Sometimes the diesel/petrol smell is just too much for the mrs, so if I could mask it a little... more rompey for me!<br /><br />NOPE!&nbsp; Bad idea! Nah, Bah, Epah!<br /><br />From personal experience, your eyes won&#039;t stop watering for 10 mins, and your buzz is totally killed by the discomfort! Which lasts a decade!<br /><br />IF you really, REALLY have to cut your shit down, I recommend glucose powder.

				Magnesium comes in multiple forms, the main difference would be bio availability and price. Oxide, citrate, sulphate, glycinate, citrate (etc) are all used in various supplements (iHerb for info). Specific nasal interactions aren&#039;t know to me. Buy magnesium in all three forms and test it.<br /><br />Magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) is a weird smelling, foul tasting mess.<br /><br />There is some irony in the fact that most people are magnesium deficient yet their main source will be poor quality speed along with synthesis impurities. Harm reduction at its best.<br /><br />Jim made a good suggestion about glucose.
