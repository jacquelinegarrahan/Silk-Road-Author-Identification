				Learned this technique from a long time user of West Coast BTH I.V.<br /><br />Most people that use BTH for longer than 6 months end up losing their veins and having to muscle it because of the excess acid and how cut to fuck tar can potentially be sometimes. Not to mention re using outfits that are dull because the pharmacia&#039;s make it so hard to get new ones. I walked into several pharmacy&#039;s with a pack of old outfits/a new bottle of insulin//the Type R Insulin cut out taped to the back of my I.D. trying to get new ones advising that I am a diabetic and even using my &quot;right to life&quot; on occasion, and I still don&#039;t get to walk out with rigs every time that&#039;s how crazy it is in California...<br /><br />These dipshits are the same type who would refuse to sell condoms and birth control in Africa if they could. I don&#039;t understand these types of people. I don&#039;t look like a fiend, I&#039;m clean cut, dress nice, never go in smacked and still get shit about getting rigs even when I jump through the hoops there is always a pharmacist or Pharmacist rep who is gonna be a dickhead/bizatch and doesn&#039;t want to help you. Another reason why I encourage ordering online or going to an exchange if your lucky and skipping this BS altogether anyways back to the subject..<br /><br />You gotta understand what BTH is to really understand why its so bad. For those that don&#039;t know, Black Tar Heroin is a crude, rather cheaply made mexican type of heroin/morphine. The process includes the same as regular heroin even extracting pure morphine base from the opium, the difference being the aceytlyating* agent and lack of re flux apparatus. So basically Morphine base is just left to cook in a giant pot with Glacial Acetic Acid or Acetic Chloride, these reagents are less than optimal compared to &quot;AA&quot; which will yield more H and less impurities. BTH is simply a cocktail of morphine and related opiates, some people even prefer it to real H.<br /><br />IMO the high from BTH is less clean feeling, but it definitely will make you nod out and feel more F&#039;d up than true H with equal doses of course. The true problem with BTH comes from the fact that the Mexicans that make it don&#039;t always neutralize the acid with ammonia and baking soda with every batch hence why the hard type tars sometimes are cleaned up and don&#039;t smell like vinegar where other batches do.<br /><br />The batches that do smell of vinegar have excess acid left over from the process as well as fats and any other possibly added impurities like cutting agents believe it or not. I don&#039;t understand how they can cut an already impure product but everyone wants to be the boss making that dough so that&#039;s why you see a lot of BS. BTH is a direct response to at least 3 factors -- the DEA making &quot;AA&quot; so hard to get, cartels also wanting cheaper manufacturing costs easier to make it in back yards, and last but not least also a direct response to junkies wanting cheaper dope. H is a very labor intensive product, and a very expensive one compared to others IMO. Enough with the history lesson and back to the Harm Reduction..<br /><br />Most people drop their tar into some tap water in the cooker and just heat it. One would call this taking your coffee black.. horrible idea. 1st reason, the amount of acid left over will burn the hell out of your veins, 2nd reason the cut is usually sugar and doesn&#039;t get you high and just clogs your system. easy remedy, take a tiny tiny tiny little dab of baking soda and touch it to your tar( too much and it will make your shot weak, it needs to be very very very little like a dab, just enough for your tar to start bubbling when the water touches it.) the baking soda brings the PH closer to neutral but not exactly neutral without making the morphine fall out of the solution. The crap and dark pigment will bind to the tiny bit of Baking soda and fall out when heated. Another thing to do is realize that opiates are water soluble even in cold water.<br /><br />ICE cold water will prevent the sugars from being drawn into the solution. Leave your piece of tar in the cooker of ice cold water and tiny tiny tiny pinch of baking soda for about a minute or two. Keep stirring and once it stops bubbling, take the little piece of tar still in the water out of the cooker and hold it up to the light, it should be just a little see through piece of sugar that doesn&#039;t need to go into your veins. Heat the water after the sugar piece is discarded by smoking on foil..<br /><br />Now take a nice piece of cleaned/washed balled up cotton, throw it in the cooker, draw it up, notice the lighter color, see through ice tea or light yellow shot now? Much better than that black as death can&#039;t see through black coffee huh? Your veins will thank you for it too. If you use new rigs and this method every time you won&#039;t have problems as quickly that is for sure. I can attest to first hand experience from those that do use this method and those that don&#039;t and are all now using the muscle technique (harsh)..<br /><br />I try to explain this technique to those who will care to listen. I&#039;d say 99% of junkies are stuck in there ways and will always prep the way they first learned but if you want your veins, this is how you do it with tar. Just takes a little extra time and simple understanding of some opiate&#039;d chemistry. Easy folks..<br />
