You can try MDMA without risking yourself, it&#039;s not very addictive. You can try acid and shrooms too they&#039;re almost harmless.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t try meth or opiates tho they can seriously fuck u up if ur not prepared for it

				Hey dude,<br />As someone dipping their feet into the chemical universe for the first time, here is your checklist:<br /><br />Ask for advice in the right place: CHECK<br />Read and research as much as you can, particularly experience reports and scientific papers<br />Establish to the best of your resources that your drug of choice is legitimate (test kit recommended)<br />Gain access to an accurate set of scales and research the appropriate dosages<br />Try a tiny sub-active amount of the drug as an allergy test<br />Make sure your set, setting and general mindset is as comfortable as possible and that you will have no responsibilities whilst high (a little anxiety is normal)<br />Try and make the most of it! Prepare activities and an environment that will allow you to make the most of your chosen substance<br /><br />If you can tick all of these boxes leading up to your experience, the chances of something going wrong will be greatly reduced. You will be a model of responsibility for the drug community, and a pioneering example on the right course for global justice. <br /><br />Oh and most of all: have fun.<br /><br /><br />

				it&#039;s all about having self control and setting limits and sticking to those limits no matter what...<br /><br />i&#039;ve tried methamphetamine before...i&#039;ve tried opiates before...those are some of the most addictive substances out there and yet i never developed as habit because i set my limits and stuck to them...i&#039;ve only done meth a total of 3 times in my life...<br /><br />people say that MDMA isn&#039;t addictive but i have friends who want to roll every weekend which i advise against because that&#039;s a quick way to deplete serotonin...no more than once a month for MDMA is the guideline i&#039;ve stuck to for the past 15 years and it has served me well....<br /><br />acid isn&#039;t addictive but the psychological impact of it can be quite overwhelming if you don&#039;t know how to deal with it...<br /><br />it doesn&#039;t sound like you have any friends that can teach you anything about these drugs so you&#039;re gonna have to do lots of research and educate yourself...so start here: http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/

				I second the advice about visiting Erowid for research, lots of good information on there.<br /><br />Also be careful with hallucinogens like LSD and mushrooms, they are mind openers and demand respect. If you take them in the wrong surroundings, with the wrong people or have something traumatic happen while under the influence then you risk having a bad trip, which generally means having 6-8 hours of fear, panic attacks and really scary hallucinations. I recommend not smoking weed, maybe have a drink or two while tripping to increase confidence and avoid the risks of PTSD. Whether the effects are good, bad or just plain strange they can stay with you for a very long time (5+ years in my experience) so it&#039;s best to have a good time. Humans are emotional beings and you may well have an epiphany that is just wrong, discover God, develop a new phobia or have a weird feeling when you see certain objects for the next half a decade. I&#039;m pretty sure that my tripped out vision has never fully gone away, not sure if that&#039;s permanent brain damage or if it&#039;s something that has always been there and I&#039;m just aware of it now I know what it looks like. Whatever the case, taking too much LSD or taking it too often is not a good idea.<br /><br />MDMA is a pretty good ride but don&#039;t do it too often, your risks are depression and possibly even amphetamine psychosis afterwards. It&#039;s best done at a club where everyone else is doing it, having a dance and meeting new people, not a shitty drinking club where everyone wants to fight or fuck. Either that or with your SO for a night of cuddles, massage and sex.

				Thanks for the Advice :) Really Appreciated.<br /><br />Tho, i&#039;m still not quite mentally prepared for all these. I do believe that drug activate some part of our brain receptor, where we are unable to activate the receptor independently. These are my question:<br />&nbsp;-After taking man-made drugs, do you guys look at life differently or you see a bigger picture in life?<br />&nbsp;-In General, What is mildest drug and what are the side effects? ( i do believe when there&#039;s up there must be down, It balance the way of life ) <br />&nbsp;-Will it affect on your health such as. Appetite? Stamina? Awareness? Stupidity? ( out of curiosity ) and etc...<br />&nbsp;-God-made or Man-made? ( your preference )<br />&nbsp;-Is there such thing as a man-made drugs for you to concentrate on Studies? Book? or maybe take off the butterfly on the stomach in an exam hall, so that you can concentrate on the exam?<br />&nbsp;-After taking man-made drugs, how does it affect your daily life up until today?<br /><br />I know this is kinda crappy and all, but i would really appreciate it. Since i&#039;m doing reasearch and survey from the experts or should i say Yoda.

And it only lasts for a week or two.<br />DMT which is technically a natural drug (look it up) Has given me a more spiritual nature then I think I had before, I also somewhat reevaluated my religious thought (still Agnostic-atheist) to a more firm belief in the lack of a single &quot;God&quot; but as the saying goes &quot;4 believers are set a test by god one comes back a heretic, one goes insane, another comes back unchanged, and the final man returns with his faith renewed and stronger then ever&quot;<br />-Adderall / Ritalin / Low dose meth can help significantly with studying. PEA (Phenethylamine) + MAO-B inhibition works similarly but has a dirty come down. some people take low dose mdma to remove social/test anxiety<br />-I think my life has improved. do note I don&#039;t dabble with opiates, benzos, amphetamines so my input is somewhat skewed.

				Ninjuh, are you a native english speaker? <br /><br />If so, then I&#039;m guessing you are a child and should wait a few years before experiment with drugs. Your brain is still developing, and may develop abnormally if you start now. <br /><br />However, If you are not a native english speaker, and I&#039;m assuming an adult, then the only advice I have is to research everything BEFORE you take it. Read erowid trip reports, know what you&#039;re getting into, know how addictive it is, how to dose it safely, and what set and settings are best to take it in, drug interactions, etc. Research, research, and more research is best. You shouldn&#039;t be coming to us asking how to teach you how to take drugs, you should go out, start googling stuff, and teach yourself. It&#039;s impossible for us to list everything here.

				I think it&#039;s best to really take it easy if you&#039;re under 18. Personally, as a more experienced user, and even more so since SR came along, I can&#039;t imagine being able to have the self control necessary if I didn&#039;t have a fair amount of life experience in various aspects.<br /><br />Weed is great though! You&#039;re clearly on the right track!<br /><br />If you feel you&#039;re ready, or if you&#039;re just going to dive in anyway (hopefully with caution), then I recommended MDMA before anything else.&nbsp; The reasons for this are that MDMA is very pleasurable, fun, easygoing and relatively worry-free (both from a psychological and physical standpoint), provided the dose isn&#039;t too high (and even then, it&#039;s quite forgiving to an extent).<br />It will show you just what man-made chemicals are capable of!<br /><br />Psychedelic wise, given that I do believe you&#039;re fairly young, I would worry about you getting into psychedelics the most.&nbsp; They can be absolutely amazing and wonderful, but you are usually at their mercy, while your subconscious mind controls your experience, whether you like it or not.&nbsp; It can be amazing, sometimes hit or miss, sometimes bland, often-times very mind expanding and a lot of fun!<br />When things go bad, they go REALLY bad.&nbsp; It&#039;s terrifying.&nbsp; So, I say this not because you wont be able to handle it someday, but because it&#039;d be a shame to have a really bad early experience and be scared off such wonderful tools for life.&nbsp; The experiences need adequate mental preparation and well-being beforehand.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to start out on man-made psychedelics then i&#039;d recommend LSD (low to medium dose, usually 1 or 2 tabs), moderate 2cb (15 to 30mg), or even MDA (similar to MDMA while being more visual and interesting).<br /><br />Stay away from the NBOME drugs.&nbsp; I have had my fair share of trips with them, a few fun ones, one amazing one, and one utterly terrifying one.&nbsp; The experience varies, but the common link between them is the physical side-effects i&#039;ve encountered repeatedly.&nbsp; So much tension you feel like you&#039;re going to have a heart attack or seizure. So much tension it can get to a point where you can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re breathing or not, so you start to freak out.... it&#039;s hard to stay calm if the bad trip due to side effects is present, because you really don&#039;t know how safe the drug is, so how are you going to stay calm if you start to panic?&nbsp; At least with LSD you can push the boundaries.&nbsp; People have already started dying from pushing the boundaries of the NBOMEs, as well as attempting &quot;safe&quot; responsible doses.&nbsp; That said, I will probably explore NBOMEs from my stash again, but very carefully.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to overdose, even with blotter, and not that safe.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to get some quality LSD again.<br /><br />2cb is fun and colourful and doesn&#039;t screw with your actually thinking processes too much.&nbsp; You get to see all kinds of fun psychedelic things while being pleasantly stoned, slightly stimulated and generally in a good mood.&nbsp; Say hello to Mr. Tracer<br /><br />Maybe when you&#039;re older!
