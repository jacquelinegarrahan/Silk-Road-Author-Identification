				I was planning on candyflipping in about three weeks. Never done it before. The issue is that I haven&#039;t been able to try the acid I&#039;ve got (VitaCats Mayan print). The E I&#039;ve got my hands on is Partyflock from Schizofreen. I&#039;ve tried them two times, each time taking one pill and no refill and that gave me a great roll lasting approx three hours. I don&#039;t really have time to try the acid before this and due to other reasons I don&#039;t have the opportunity candyflip in the nearby future after this occasion. I&#039;ve heard that VitaCats acid is really strong. What would happen if my friends and I would ingest the acid and E and it would turn out we&#039;ve eaten too much? I&#039;ve read that you should take less of each drug than you would do by itself. Otherwise it could get &quot;too intense&quot;. What does &quot;too intense&quot; mean here? Is it equivalent to a bad trip or just that it would incapacitate you in a pool of intense happiness for several hours leaving you unable to do anything but lying down and enjoying your trip?<br /><br />TL;DR: Taking unknown strength of acid first time candyflipping. Bad idea? What does a &quot;too intense&quot; trip&nbsp; stand for? <br /><br />Edit: I&#039;m fairly experienced with psychedelics. I&#039;ve only been doing it for 1.5 years, but during the last 9 months I&#039;ve been experimenting alot. <br />LSD: ~10 times<br />Mushrooms: ~8 times<br />Smoked DMT/Changa: ~20 times<br />Oral DMT/pharmauasca: 1 time<br />4ho-met: ~5times<br />2C-B: 6 times<br />MDMA: 5 times<br /><br />During one LSD trip I saw the light/was one with the universe/transcended into God. I&#039;ve had contacts with entities on DMT, laying on a table surrounded by several aliens probing my brain with a glowing stick. In other words, I feel I am quite experienced with intense trips.

				&quot;Too intense&quot; is usually subjective. Some people associate it with a LOT of visuals, loss of ego, total interconnectedness with the world, etc.. while others associate it with a chaotic and confusing trip. One VitaCat Maya shouldn&#039;t be enough to offer for a chaotic trip, especially if you follow proper set and setting guidelines. They&#039;ve been established to be around ~250ug, which is a strong yet beautiful dosage. As for candyflipping, it&#039;s my favorite, and any chaos or negative feelings that is brought on by the higher dose of LSD will be counteracted by MDMA&#039;s empathogenic qualities and will offer for a very fun, positive, and beautiful trip. Make sure you follow a timeline so that the LSD and MDMA peak and comedown at around the same time. My recommendation:<br /><br />T+0:00: VitaCat&#039;s Maya<br />T+2:00: Schizofreen&#039;s Partyflock<br /><br />Cheers!

				Thanks for the advice!<br /><br />What do you think about re-dosing the MDMA? <br />In my experience it makes the comedown harsher but it lasts ~2 hours longer. Could that be good so as to make sure that the MDMA comedown doesn&#039;t happen in the middle of the LSD-trip?

				No problem! On the topic of redosing, I have a thread regarding MDMA best practices that you should take a look at, my friend. It&#039;s rather lengthy, but there is a lot of valuable information. You can find it here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048

				I recently candyflipped on an MDMA sample and acid I received the same day. (100mg + 1tab) and I could sit around infront of my parents without them knowing anything.<br />Drop the acid and as you feel it starting to come on (1.5-2 hours after holding tongue on tab.) drop the MDMA with a few sips of hot water, broken into 4 pieces to hit quicker<br />Don&#039;t redose, see how it pans out the first time. Keep it magical. <br />It was amazing and really made my day. Not intense at all.<br /><br />When you&#039;re at your peak, play &quot;Candyflip - Strawberry Fields&quot; but don&#039;t watch the video (Its a little corny, just minimize it &amp; close your eyes for a bit, lol)<br /><br />After my MDMA came down, I did the stupidest thing and smoked my pipe. As I exhaled my mind kept going in loops and I had to hide away from people for a while. there was nothing wrong but I felt really confused as my mind kept repeating thoughts as it phased through &#039;what to do&#039;. I was going to take half a Xanax but decided to just sit down and ride it out. I was fine. It was only a single tab but its strong stuff and the MDMA comedown probably didn&#039;t help. <br /><br />Get a benzo or some tranquilisers for that stage because it isn&#039;t worth subjecting your mind to since you&#039;ll remember every minute of it.. (I believe the cannabis brought the shit on, because it did the same thing last time and another time with shrooms.)<br /><br />Hope you have a blast!<br /><br />Love &amp; Godspeed!
