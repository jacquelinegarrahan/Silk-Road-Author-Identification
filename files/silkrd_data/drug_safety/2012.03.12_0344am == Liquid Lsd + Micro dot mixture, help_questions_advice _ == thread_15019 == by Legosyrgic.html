				Heya silkroad! Im curiously an eager joe wandering about a mixture i plan to maybe proceed on with a few friends to have a awesome night! We planned on getting a few microdots like 5, crushing them and putting them into our liquid we have its about 60ugs its 100hits. We really dont care to waste dots or the liquid as its all for our fun and games. Really i know it could be a waste to some but we jus having fun. So our question to this community is what would be some good advice should we crush up all the dots or try to only extract the inner middle of the dots that is a greyish , more white color. oR crush em all up with the blue/red coloring on the outside? If yo guys got any better ideas to mix these please throw us comments. Again we are here to learn so feel free to be honest. Thanks yo!!

				tbh dude, i think you guys smoked one too many blunts today.. lol<br /><br />as far as extrapolating pin-sized amounts of lsd from a microdot.. which is already retarded-ly small to begin with..<br />i imagine you will only lose precious molecules doing this..<br /><br />if you are hell bent on crushing the ones you have then i wouldn&#039;t see any harm in just tossing them into the vial with the other doses as you said<br /><br />make sure you think long and hard about having shit float around in your vial though.. we decided to put some tabs in a vial we had a few years back.. strong doses, but you had to drop goopy shit.. reminded me of some disgusting things<br /><br />hope that helped a little bit.. lol<br />good luck with whatever you try to do<br /><br />
