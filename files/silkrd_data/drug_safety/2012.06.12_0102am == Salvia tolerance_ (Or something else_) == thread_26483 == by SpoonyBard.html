				Okay, so I know from all the reading that salvia&#039;s not supposed to be cross-tolerant with any other hallucinogens, and might even be *reverse* tolerant with itself. (I.e. it gets more intense the more you take.)&nbsp; But that hasn&#039;t been my experience these past few days, and I&#039;m hoping you guys can help me figure this out.<br /><br />FIRST EXPERIENCE: a little over two weeks ago. I smoked about 50 mg of 20X salvia extract, and broke through in maybe a minute. The room broke apart into people who were also geometric shapes, and it was a total geometric-spinning-universe, forget-who-I-am experience. Once I remembered who I was, it was still a little while before my identity and room seemed familiar again and made sense.&nbsp; It was an intense but positive trip.<br /><br />SECOND EXPERIENCE: Thursday. First day of a local burn. This time I did about the same amount of a 40X extract. My girlfriend says I dropped the pipe and was out instantly. I don&#039;t remember the start of the vision; just the end, when some sort of woven gear kept squeezing me through multiple universes and I was trying to understand a word or syllable that was different in every one. I was reportedly speaking in tongues when I came out of it, and it took me a little while before anything anyone else said made sense.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t do salvia on Friday, but did do some surprisingly intense shrooms.&nbsp; (Thanks to Rocker here on SR.)&nbsp; Had a good long trip, with strong visuals and a deep sense of connectedness.<br /><br />THIRD EXPERIENCE: Saturday evening. Same amount of the 40X as Thursday.&nbsp; Did very little for me.&nbsp; I _started_ to feel some of the physical pressing sensation and geometric perceptions, but it faded before it got strong, and a second hit didn&#039;t help. Within a couple minutes I wasn&#039;t even feeling disoriented.&nbsp; After the first two strong trips it was rather a letdown.<br /><br />FOURTH EXPERIENCE: Sunday evening, because I wanted to see if I could.&nbsp; I did about 45mg of a 60X extract, and I did it in my Vapor Genie pipe so it would vaporize. Virtually nothing happened.<br /><br />...So despite stronger concentrations, trying salvia three times in four days ended up doing less and less for me.&nbsp; My girlfriend theorizes I was just getting tolerant to it, or else maybe the mushrooms interfered. But I was firm in thinking that salvinorin A was the one psychedelic chemical that doesn&#039;t work like all the others that way.<br /><br />Anyone have any theories or similar experiences?&nbsp; CAN you become tolerant to salvia? Or was I just maybe in the wrong psychological space the last two times, or getting too confident in expecting breakthroughs, or something?&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely going to wait a while before trying it again now, but it&#039;s still confusing.&nbsp; (And I&#039;d be pissed if I managed somehow to burn myself out my first two times trying it.)&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp;

				Salvia is a strange creature.<br /><br />Remember that reverse tolerance does not behave in a linear way. You don&#039;t get successively more high every time you do it. You do experience tolerance to salvia, but it is very subtle. The Mushrooms should not interfere significantly. You should be able to break through every time if you simply ingest enough psychoactive matter. The only way you can have a chance of finding out the source of this effect is by keeping as many variables constant as possible. <br />(1) For example, you mention using different extracts: 20x,40x, and 60x. Have you tried going back to the 20x? Maybe the other extracts are to blame. <br />(2) Are you using the VG as the default smoking technique? You mentioned a pipe; were you referring to the VG? <br />As an observer I can only speculate. <br /><br />As a side note, I think salvia trips can show you much more and result in a much more enjoyable experience if you enter it with a mind[set] that does not demand anything from the salvia, and that is not in distress from previous failures. I suggest practicing some meditation prior to the experience, or at least approaching from a neutral perspective. The trip is supposed to be fun. If it&#039;s not working, try something new.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Not an expert here, but: you did all of these from different amounts of different concentrations and probably from different sources (i.e., different levels of quality/quantity). You can&#039;t possibly do a rigorous scientific or wannabe scientific comparison under those circumstances.<br /><br />My advice: stick to one concentration, the same quantity, and preferably from the same source. That way you can come up with some rational deductions on what is happening.<br /><br />Best wishes with the Lady.<br /><br />soyyo

				What was your source of salvia? Did it come packaged in this little ziplock bag with folder carton stapled over it, color-coded (yellow, red, purple, green, black indicating concentration). I&#039;m asking because I&#039;ve had some &quot;Salvia Divinorum, red level, .5g&quot; from WinstonWolfe (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/12c79868ca), smoked out of a wooden pipe, but felt absolutely no effect. I&#039;ve smoked half a package, so about .25g.
