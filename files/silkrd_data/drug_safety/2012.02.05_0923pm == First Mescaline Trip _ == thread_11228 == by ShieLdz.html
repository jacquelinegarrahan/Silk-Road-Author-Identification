				As the topic implies I have my first mez-cal trip coming up soon (thanks gammagoblin!!&nbsp; ;)) and I was hoping&nbsp; for some advice...<br /><br />1. HOW MUCH SHUOLD I TAKE AND HOW SHOULD I TAKE IT? It&#039;s in its powder/crystal form and I understand it taste like shit, so I was thinking about parachuting it...any other suggestions? As far as dosage is concerned, I definitely want the full experience, but I don&#039;t want to &quot;overdo&quot; it either.<br /><br />2. WHAT SHOULD I DO? This is most important! What are some the &quot;must-do&quot; things on mescaline? <br /><br />3. WHAT ELSE?? Any essentials I need stock up on? any advice on food, music, movies, anything...<br /><br />any advice is good advice&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;ve never tried syth Mesc, but I assume it&#039;d be more or less the same as extracted:<br /><br />1) Try 250mg for a first go...<br />Will be enough to get the full experience, but shouldn&#039;t take you over the deep end...<br />My preferred method for mescaline is to dissolve in a small cup of warm water... Or herbal tea. Sip slowly as you begin to focus your intentions. Doesn&#039;t taste great, but like as with shrooms, I feel it&#039;s better to taste it and accept it than to try to avoid it.<br /><br />2) Do? Just sit, and THINK. In the nature if possible!!! You won&#039;t need anything to DO if you are in a beautiful place, far from interruption. <br /><br />3) Water. Stay hydrated. Skip the munchies and material things, and go look at the stars!!!<br /><br />4) ENJOY.

				I prefer not to eat during the day of a mescaline trip. I may drink a smoothie if I get hungry but I find my body more comfortable during the experience if I havent eaten.

				I would disagree with your disagreement. Tolerance tends to be an issue when trying to dose again the next and/or subsequent days. Redosing during the same event has a cumulative effect and is quite common practice. Ive taken 750mg all at once, and from the same batch in 250, +2hr 250, +1hr 250....and the incremental dosing was only slightly less intense but prolonged noticeably. I think youll find if you read others experiences on the usual sites that incremental dosing is pretty common.

It doesn&#039;t add to the effects much at all past the two hour point. LSD and shrooms are positively that way. Once again, mescaline may be different. Not too up on my mescaline knowledge.

				Well I can assure you my own experiences have shown that repeat dosing is quite effective.<br />LSD takes about 2-3 hours to peak....perhaps thats where your idea of a 2+ hour limit comes from.<br />Mescaline takes about 3-4 hours to peak....assuming that was the effective period for augmenting dosage my recommendation unintentionally falls within it..<br /><br />

				I was planning on taking at least 300 all at once (I was originally thinkin about taking like 300; then if I liked a couple hours later I could eat a couple hundered more...but I guess that WOULD be overdoing it!). <br /><br />I&#039;m an experienced tripper with LSD and Mushies. I would say I fall in the &#039;3+ tabs&#039; category of L heads (unless it&#039;s some good ol skool) - meaning I like stronger doses of LSD - but, at the same time I prefer mushrooms at lower doses, if at all - boom boom&#039;s make me feel like shit physically, but more than that I always feel like I&#039;m coming in and out of good AND bad trips on mushrooms, which can freak me out at high doses (&gt;3.5-4g). <br /><br />I hear mezcal is the most euphoric of the three (by far) and just gets better at high doses...except physically, which I guess is pretty bad for awhile but that I can bear, bad trips I can&#039;t<br /><br />Basically, I&#039;m looking for the &quot;3 tabs&quot; equivalent dose of M. - if that makes any sense lol&nbsp; ;D

Just sip slowly over a period of about 30 minutes. Your body will tell you when it&#039;s too much.

				If you want to avoid gastric sensations, chew 1-2 grams of Zingiber (look up in wikipedia, it&#039;s very common spice) or you can use encapsulated Zingiber sold in shops, 30 mins prior to ingestion of mescaline. Don&#039;t take too much Zingiber, because it&#039;s slightly psychoactive in higher doses and might cause drowsiness etc. Do not eat anything for 2-3 hours before the trip (and even then eat only light food like fruits, rice etc, no fat / meat!).<br /><br />My first trip was on 350mg but my experience with psychedelics was already quite big, so I was underwhelmed and had to add 150ug of LSD (and then it was beautiful). If I had a second chance to have my first time, I would take 450-500mg. That&#039;s where this substance shows it&#039;s unique character and becomes the real queen of phenetylamines.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. Mescaline loves nature and hates buildings, cities etc. I would never take mescaline in an apartment (altough my first trip was at my friend&#039;s house). Music on mesc is great, sex is even better :)<br /><br />Have fun on your first trip and remember - it&#039;s better to take too much than not enough! :D

But you really think I need the zingiber? <br /><br />First experiences with any new drug is always the best imo, I feel like it&#039;s a typically noob mistake to play it TOO safe and take less for the first time. I remember&nbsp; the first time I &quot;experimented&quot; with real drugs, I took one blue dolphin xtc pill. I had a great time for sure, but still to this day I wish I had taken one more that day - you can never redo your first roll. Since then, I make sure to take at least the normal/full amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tagore, I&#039;ve talked to a lot of people who also like the tea idea, but to me that sounds like a pain in the ass especially if it&#039;s going to taste like shit. I&#039;ve also heard a lot of peeps take it in pill form like in a capsule, but i obviously don&#039;t hav any capsules laying around...What&#039;s up with just just wrapping it in Kleenex and parachuting it? or snorting it? I would like to get your opinion this too gg<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the nature bit though&nbsp; :(.&nbsp; &nbsp; Honestly, I&#039;m not too big on nature in the first place - I love cities, I&#039;m in constant awe at the accomplishments of mankind and our command over complex physical laws, I find cities to be absolutely inspiring! Also, I live in a downtown loft (it&#039;s pretty badass, all &quot;urban chic&quot; style) so cities are unavoidable and nature is actually hard to come by. In fact, to get to &quot;nature&quot; I would have to go into some of the outlying neighborhoods (a.k.a. the ghetto) and that could be a really bad idea. <br />

				If you don&#039;t have capsules, parachuting is the way to go. If I had to drink &quot;mescaline tea&quot;, I would probably puke after first few sips :D But that&#039;s just me. And I&#039;m strongly against snorting anything, especially when you have to take large volume of powder. I would say - parachuted 450mg.<br /><br />And about nature - I&#039;m a nature freak, so take that into consideration, too :) If you like industrial environment, you will probably like it even more while on mesc.

				I just find hallogenics scary, I think I have a very active imagination.&nbsp; I get slight hallicanations on Meth.&nbsp; If I lie down and try to rest if I have things to do the next day.<br /><br />On Monday I decided to have a 2 hour liedown after about 150 mg of Meth, and I saw big blue floaty thing that were made out of smoke, I got up and they went but as soon as I lay down again I saw the smoky dragon things again.<br /><br />How much different would by a mescaline/LSD trip be, I am kinda tempted to try, but a bit scared too.

				Cool cool. thank you everyone for your posts...One last question though - promise this is the last one - When should I take it? like what time of day I mean...<br />I&#039;ve heard people say mezcal trips last for like 10-14hrs, but I&#039;ve also heard the same shit about LSD! (imo LSD trips ACTUALLY last for like 6-8hrs, less the time it takes to come up and that comedown/in-between period when you&#039;re not sure whether you&#039;re still glowing or not, even though you prob are&nbsp; ;)). <br />So what do you guys think? take it in the afternoon while the sun is still up, or what?

				I&#039;ve never done mescaline, but I almost always dose up any psychedelic in the late afternoon so I can get some day tripping in—sun, clouds, shadows—before the nighttime adventure starts in full force.

				That depends on where are you going to trip. If it&#039;s in nature, I suggest taking mesc in the noon, so most of the peak will be at day with a nice comedown at the sunset. Mesc is definitely &quot;daylight&quot; psychedelic (more interesting visuals, stronger psychedelic headspace). But if you are going to trip in an apartment, I suggest that you take it during an afternoon and aim with the peak for evening.

				First of all let me thank gg AGAIN, this is why gg is my favorite vendor on SR, he not only delivers excellent product but he also takes the time to post on threads like mine to insure that his customers get the best possible experience from his products! wow that sounds like a troll comment, but it&#039;s not Im for real.<br /><br />Everyone&#039;s input here has been invaluable&nbsp; I finally feel prepared to take this (for some reason I always like to &#039;prepare&#039; before a trip, for me it takes away all the anxiety). I think i&#039;m going to take it this weekend depending on the weather (one of the days is calling for T-storms, so I might go with that day could be interesting); Anywho, I should be providing a trip report the day after, either on here or on gg&#039;s page. <br /><br />Btw, I talked to friend who thinks swimming is THE quintessential mescaline experience - granted that does me no good as I dont have a pool and it&#039;s still winter (lol) i just figured I&#039;d mention it - I mean it sounds like it&#039;d be sweet to me! ..maybe next time

				Hey ShieLdz<br /><br />Did you get a chance to try it? I&#039;m quite like you in my approach towards first time drug usage. I like to be &quot;prepared&quot;, which most definitely vibes well with who I am when not using drugs as well.<br />I&#039;m looking into ordering some mescaline over the next couple of days, and I would love to hear your experience if you&#039;ve tried it yet.<br /><br />Cheers

				The first time I did mescaline i took 1600 mg and It blew my head apart. Also what route of administration are you gonna use I blew mine and it was a bad idea it feels like your face is on fire and you start tripping instantly. Just warning you to be careful and fave fun. Peace
