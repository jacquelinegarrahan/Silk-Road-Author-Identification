				What do you usually do when you drop an NBOMe? Do you ever drop alone? <br />

				I prefer 25c and I usually drop alone. Great for a relaxing evening at home watching movies or catching up on t.v. shows.

				Me and a couple friends just did 25i. 1000micrograms each on HCL tab. I did 1 and a half tabs...that extra half really got me. We were out in front of my house in my driveway literally all night from 11pm to 4am. They went home at 4, none of us got any sleep.<br /><br />Honestly, it was a really crazy experience. I was definately high as fuck, tripping my balls off hallucinating. After the first hour, I got almost overwhelmed thinking that this would last another 5-7 hours. But I made it through without pussing out and popping a xanax.<br /><br />Staying up to watch the sunrise from darkness it really nice btw. The birds were chirping like 5 minutes before the sun came out, then suddenly I noticed the sky getting brighter and brighter. I kind of felt like shit at that point because I&#039;d been up for 24 hours and my stomach KILLED!(Not sure if side effect of 25i).<br /><br />Worth it though I guess. I dont think I&#039;ll be doing it again soon though, in fact Im going for real LsD this next time. Give it a try though just make sure you do your research so you know how to safely dose(1 tab first time is what Id reccomend) and all that.

				I drop alone all the time, only sometimes with others. Whatever you want really. But if you&#039;ve never done it before maybe start with a small dose if you&#039;ll be alone.<br /><br />What to do? Drink lots of water and stay cool, seriously. But after that, whatever you want! Some recommendations, in no particular order: listen to music, make music (guitar is awesome on 25i!), take a shower, eat delicious food, go for a walk, play with yourself or somebody else, watch a movie, meditate, have a beer or two (not to get drunk, it&#039;ll just taste so damn good), play some sports (stay very well hydrated if you do this, tons of fun though between the phenethylamine energy boost and psychedelic lucidity).<br /><br />Have fun and be safe!

				I&#039;ll generally take it in a party situation. First up get nicely stoked with a few drinks, then I&#039;ll slip and tab into my mouth, try to let it perculate as long as possible and party away. I like drinking with it as it reduces the initial come up, and can ride it to the extent I want. In other words, ease off the drinks and go with the NBom flow or sometimes drink more and get totally wacked. Works good for me.
