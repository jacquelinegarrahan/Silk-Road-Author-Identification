				So I got some molly recently. Locally not from SR. It had a good Marquis reaction, really fast to purple. But my friends and I all agreed that it felt like Methylone. It was really speedy and the roll was over pretty fast. So my question is; can a Marquis test distinguish MDMA from Methylone?

				It should create a yellow color, nothing like purple.

				Yes they can. Along with other less-popular brand reagent tests. <br /><br />MDMA=purple/black/bubbles<br />Methylone= bright yellow if good/dim yellow is average<br /><br />^^the above are only for the Marquis Reagent,&nbsp; not sure about the other brand reagent tests.<br /><br />Even though the molly may have tested purple, it could be weak. <br />Or other factors could have led to you guys thinking it wasn&#039;t MDMA.

				hi hi<br /><br />yes the marquis reagent will DEFINITELY tell the difference between MDMA and bk-MDMA (M1)<br /><br />i&#039;ve personally done tests and can attest that proper &quot;molly&quot; is INSTANTLY black/purple. sometimes it also bubbles a bit. M1 will react to glow bright yellow/orange (depending on the lighting conditions) <br /><br />it&#039;s a VERY different color.<br /><br />as stated, the reagent test will only tell you &quot;what&quot; the substance is. not how pure it is!&nbsp; for purity, you need to get a little more involved; either do an anhydrous acetone wash (rough idea of purity) or thin film chroma (better, but slightly more involved) or if you have access, run it through a GC/MS to get the full chemical profile.<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

				Wow, thanks guys! I&#039;ve never bought a test kit in the original packaging, I just know a girl who has a bunch of them and if I need one I just ask her for one. I&#039;ve never really read any directions or paid much attention to the bag. She just told me &quot;make sure it turns purple fast.&quot; I guess I should invest in a few different brands of kits and learn how to properly use them. I just got my 50 posts in and am finally able to ask questions and to contribute in the grown up section and you guys have been very helpful. Also, do they sell them at head shops or do you have to order them?

				So, if someone mixed 50% M1 and 50% MDMA, what color would it test at?

The purple would swirl into the yellow until it all turned kind of a brown-black color. You won&#039;t see a purple tint in the end result as the yellow reaction of the Methylone will cancel out those hues. Now if you had trace M1, you would have the same end result as pure MDMA, with flickers of yellow bursting into the reaction here and there.&nbsp; You might even miss it.
