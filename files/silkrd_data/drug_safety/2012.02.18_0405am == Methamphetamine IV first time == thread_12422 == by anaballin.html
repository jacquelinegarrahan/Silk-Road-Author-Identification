				Sup guys/ladies,<br /><br />Just wondering if anybody could chime in here... Got some crystal en route and have never done it before. I&#039;m wondering what a nice dosage would be for a good rush and smooth high afterwards?<br /><br />Anything I should be weary of while on methamphetamine?

				FWIW, <br /><br />I tend to be a pig with drugs although I&#039;ve just started dabbling with meth.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done coke IV a lot, even did a fish flop once.&nbsp; I just got .5 g from dubg few weeks ago.&nbsp; Fucked around smoking it but did blast what was probably 100mg, very nice rush last for awhile.&nbsp; Two etizolams and the alchohol on board allowed me to sleep.&nbsp; I suspect the rush would&#039;ve been greater but I had done a few lines of blow at the bar as well as some meth before leaving house.&nbsp; I plan to get another .5g in few weeks, blast 1/3 of it and smoke the rest on a day off &quot;working around the house&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ll save the &quot;dont&#039; go down that road&quot; for others.&nbsp; <br /><br />My best rushes so far have been from good coke though, bell ringing, running water sounding like something wicked with voices whispering around me.....

				&nbsp;slammin doesnt get you a higher peak on meth. just makes the plateau last longer .. not that much longer IMO. my fav ROA is taking .25 put it in gelcap and swallow or snort it.... not worth the risks in IV ..

				I&#039;d smoke some before I IV&#039;d any, to check to see how adulterant the meth is.<br />Also IV&#039;ing meth will give you a hell of a bell ringer in the head be extremely cautious of IVing meth.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Well, I received from DubG today and slammed back a .1<br /><br />Holy shiiiit, was a weird different rush. I enjoyed it, hard to explain... but i enjoyed it for like 30 seconds and then fucking BAM I had this throbbing ass headache... I could feel my brain pounding man it was unbearable and i proceeded to throw up for like an hour. That shit sucked... I think i should have done a little less. But I can tell i would have really enjoyed the high if it wasnt for the headhache and throw up.<br /><br /><br />I read though that headaches is usually a sign of impurities and either wasn&#039;t cooked correctly or was cuz with some bullshit. I did notice the crytals were shards but had almost this thin thin layer of oily wetness. IDSK

				Finally had that &quot;day off&quot; working around the house.&nbsp; Ended up blasting twice about .15g each time, holy shit!!!!!&nbsp; I was high as fuck forever, well real high for like 4 hrs.&nbsp; Its been abour 12 hrs since the last IV dose but I did smoke a little 7 hrs ago.&nbsp; Still feel a bit wired but I have a headache now.<br /><br />For those of you that have done IV coke this is the best explanation I have, you know that 10 min period after banging you feel real fucked up?&nbsp; This is like that without that hardcore peak the first minute after injection, and it lasts a long time.
