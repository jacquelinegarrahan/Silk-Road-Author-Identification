				Title: <strong>LSD tolerance</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>iaskquestion</strong> on <strong>July 15, 2013, 08:37 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I took ~400ug of OOTP&#039;s LSD about an hour ago and I have yet to feel any effects. I hope it just has a long come up. Keep in mind that I tripped ~350ug yesterday off of some different LSD, so that could have something to do with it? Does anyone have anything to share about LSD tolerance? Also, How long does it usually take you to come up? It&#039;s usually 1-2 hours for me. I&#039;m starting to get worried that this is either weak LSD or my tolerance is through the roof. Maybe I just shouldn&#039;t trip two days in a row.<br /><br />Any input is appreciated

				I believe that LSD tolerance is something that your body does very quickly, tripping 2 days straight would require a much larger dose the second time around.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re on any anti-deprassants then your tolerance is going to be way high also.

				thanks for the advice guys!&nbsp; that link was very informative. I feel like I&#039;m wasting LSD if I take more, but I already wasted 400ug so I might as well take more right? Also, I&#039;m not on anti-depressants. I did take 6mg of xanax about 15 hours ago. Maybe that has something to do with it?

				Time.<br /><br />There&#039;s not a &quot;magic pill&quot; to lower tolerance on LSD (and most other substances btw).<br /><br />Also &quot;recovering&quot; time is a very important aspect of psychedelics, a thing that get many times misunderstood by users (with sometimes awful consequences).
