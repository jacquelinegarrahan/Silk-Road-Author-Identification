				So this is probably a pretty stupid question, but I&#039;ve never stored shrooms usually when I buy them I use them the same day. I&#039;m ordering a decent amount to take camping to share with friends, but the trip isn&#039;t till late June, I was going to wait, but figured my luck they vendor would run or be out of town and we&#039;d be SOL. <br /><br />So what is the best way to store them? I was thinking of putting them in a ziplock freezer bag and &quot;ghetto vacuuming&quot; then putting them either in the freezer or just in a dark dry place like bottom of a drawer.

				I would be careful of ziplock bags as oxygen can migrate through the plastic. Best bet is O2 proof glass container with an oxygen absorber.&nbsp; Put them in a brown paper bag, add an oxygen absorber packet, then seal in a mason jar, lid very tight and stick in the freezer.

				<br />A very good way that will keep your fungus good for months is to put them in a brown paper bag with a hand full of white rice (uncooked, raw, dry of course). I wouldn&#039;t use the freezer, its a moist environment. Instead, put them in a cool dry place. <br /><br />The method above isn&#039;t wrong, just expensive and a little over the top in my opinion. Mushrooms will keep for a long time without going to any form if extreme measures.

				Thanks for the tips, according to the shipper they are vacuum sealed, so I might just leave them in that in the bottom of a drawer.

I&#039;ve done my share of fungus farming, and I can tell you, brown paper bag with rice in a cool dry place (like the top shelf of your closet) is a great place to store for a few months. If you want to store longer than that, just sell them for $50 a zip and grow more when the time is needed.

				I recon the shrooms are already dried? Or are they fresh...? If they are fresh I&#039;d suggest drying them first. <br />Easiest way to do this is to lay them over your heater on a piece of paper. When completely dried of moisture they can be stored for months as long they are kept out of sunlight. I read that sunlight depletes psilocybin so you&#039;d wanna watch out with that :P <br /><br />If they are in fact already dried you can grind them to powder, let the powder dry as well as it might still contain moisture, and put it all in a zip bag on the top shelf of your drawer.

				I just keep mine in an envelope inside two Ziploc bags with an oxygen absorber, which I wrap up and keep inside of a black velvet bag inside of an aluminum box. Which is hidden underneath my couch. Is this good enough?

				I&#039;m guessing they will be dried and vacuum packed. So I think I&#039;m just going to leave them like that in the bottom of a drawer. I&#039;ll only be saving them till the end of June so not months or years or anything. What I don&#039;t end up eating I plan on grinding and turning into chocolate bars.
