				So the past couple of days I have been up on ice and honestly its been a real negative experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s not what this post is about though.&nbsp; About 20 minutes ago I ate two tabs of 100 uG needlepoint.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t done acid in almost 10 years so I thought it may be interesting to log the trip.<br /><br />Substances:<br /><br />Approx 100mg of high grade meth vaporized Wednesday at around midnight<br /><br />Ate another 20mg last night at around 3 AM.<br /><br />This morning after taking a two hour nap thanks to a third of a bottle of nyquill I found a letter in the mail with 5 hits I bought off of another onion site (TFM).&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure it would be appropriate to mention a specific vendor from another site where I got the LSD.&nbsp; Perhaps I should have put the trip report on their forum instead.&nbsp;

Not saying who you got it from is very likely a good choice. I don&#039;t really know the community over there, but I presume they&#039;d prefer it stay over there. That being said, I&#039;m indeed very interested in how your experience goes. =]

				Feeling a mild body high.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know what to expect.&nbsp; If I had to describe it, it would be to say that its like my senses moved from within my body to a two foot area around my body.&nbsp;

				So far it is a buzzy sort of synesthesia.&nbsp; In the center of my abdomen I can feel my life force resonating.&nbsp; I wish I weren&#039;t at such a loss for words.
