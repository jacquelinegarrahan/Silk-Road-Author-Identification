				I&#039;m sure this has been covered before, but a quick search of the forums left me clueless.<br />I recently purchased 1g of Ivory&#039;s MDMA, and took an excessive amount of close to 250mg in two separate doses doses for my first time. See thread : <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187.270</code>&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway; <br /><br />So.. it&#039;s T + &gt; 50 hours, and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m not going to be dropping again anytime soon. My vision is all fuzzy, I can&#039;t seem to get a good nights sleep without getting hideously violent nightmares and experiencing extreme paranoia and I cried yesterday for the first time in about twenty years. <br />I take it all this is down to lack of serotonin, but what exactly can I do about it? aha <br /><br />- Best regards<br /><br /><br />

				yupp... serotonin is involved in emotional states, sleeping, and dreaming so unfortunately stressing the system can produce some unwanted side effects. hang in there, you will feel better within a few days to a week. still seems like you have it pretty rough, with fuzzy vision and nightmares. after nearly daily use for a few months i probably will never feel completely the same unfortunately so i definitely recommend spacing your doses out. still i was able to stop when i decided with some crazy depression but didnt even experience symptoms as bad as your report. the withdrawal is fortunately nothing like opiates at least<br /><br />you should take some 5-htp and tyrosine which are the precursors for serotonin and dopamine, which will at least make sure your body can replenish those stores of neurotransmitters which were depleted. <br /><br />also i would recommend smoking some green if you are a cannabis user, that can make you feel better for sure and has some other beneficial properties. other than that, just healthy diet and hydration... nothing but time for your neurochem to stabilize. <br /><br />Hope you feel better soon!<br />- miR

				i got to that stage once after a very hefty 4-mmc binge some years ago, as microRNA says above get some 5-HTP or even a mild SSRI like fluoxetine (prozac) some multi vitamins and a good meal in you, as for the lack of sleep and nasty dreams a benzo may help there, they both help you sleep and suppress dream states, itll help with the paranoia too.

Especially aerobic exercises like running, swimming or hiking. They stimulate the body to release endorphins.<br /><br />It might seem silly, and is likely nothing more than some placebo effect, but I&#039;ve always found that dark chocolate also helps me to stabilize more quickly.

				Alright, thanks for the tips.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never figured the cure for a hangover would be to jog into town to buy some 5-HTP and dark chocolate, heh.&nbsp; Thanks very much

				To avoid this in the future I recommend pre-loading with antioxidants, HTP, and even some L-dopa

				I feel your pain.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been there numerous times.<br /><br />The best cure is pretty easy... time.<br /><br />You&#039;ll feel better in about 3 days. <br /><br />I would still take some 5htp though.

				Interesting to read that MDMA can cause nightmares, sure as hell explains the weird ass dreams I&#039;ve been having for the past few weeks

				I sell a supplement blend called MindFood that is designed to alleviate the after-effects of MDxx. Many people (on SR and elsewhere) have found it effective at preventing or attenuating the &#039;hangover&#039;. You can find it for sale at my profile.<br /><br />Apart from that, amino acid neurotransmitter precursors/pyridoxine is a good idea (in moderation) as are vitamin C, R-ALA, flavonoids, and other antioxidants.

				Been there man. Shit sucks. Obviously spread out your doses and lower them. My vision is permanently fuzzy from E use. Time is your best friend. A good breakfast and some exercise cant hurt either.<br /><br />As for the 5-HTP thing. I used that stuff when i was heavy into E. Honestly it never helped at all. It actually made things worse. Gave me cold sweats and made me feel on edge. That might be just me though. Weed always helps if you are having trouble sleeping just dont rely on it...dont want to associate the holy plant with that kinda pain.<br /><br />Give it time. The human brain is pretty damn good at bouncing back and getting back to baseline.

				I know exactly what you mean OP, I watched some african war documentary on youtube and ended up with tears streaming from my eyes, that is not like me at all. <br /><br />Along time ago when I was using it heavily I used to see horrible grotesque things in shadows/dark places and my imagination always drew itself towards suffering and violence on people I loved. I actually spent a fair few months not being able to open my eyes with the lights off for fear of what I would see
