				Let me first admit that I&#039;m a complete newbie to SR, so please forgive me for asking &quot;stupid&quot; questions. I&#039;m really interested in taking Valium. How would you suggest a newbie get started, i.e. dosage, legit vendor(s), etc. Thanks!

				I would NOT recommend valium if you are trying to use it for recreational use.&nbsp; Benzos have the WORST and HELLISH withdrawal even with minimal abuse.&nbsp; They can also cognitively impair you when used longterm.<br /><br />If you are just looking for small amount to use for anxiety occasionally, then make sure you read about benzos plenty first.

				+1 painbow <br /><br />I have been taking valium for about a year everyday.&nbsp; I only take 5mg - 10 mg a day to counteract the uppers I take.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; I have severe anxiety and as with any drug you should do your research.&nbsp; Several times I was about to buy something that sounded good until I did my own research and it turned out it would have had a very negative effect on me.

				WTF is wrong with you guys, fear mongering...<br /><br />If you want to take valium to just get a buzz try the 5mg pills and work your way up to you find the desired effect you&#039;re looking for. You won&#039;t have any withdrawal from just experimenting but if you take them for a few months the withdrawal can be a bitch especially if you have a weak mind.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what region you&#039;re in so I can&#039;t recommend a seller for you. If you&#039;re looking for the best deal look into the powder, it&#039;s cheaper but hard to measure out in doses (also easier to be tampered with), you must have a accurate milligram scale if you plan on getting this. Being new to benzos and overdoing it on accident could easily be harmful.

				The BUZZ from benzos isn&#039;t even worth it AT ALL if you&#039;re chasing the high.&nbsp; If you are going to go that route, go buy some hydrocodone or roxy.&nbsp; You will feel more fuzzy and high with an opioid than a benzo.<br /><br />Benzo ABUSE is just not worth it at all.&nbsp; Some heroin addicts will say that they would rather withdraw from heroin than benzo.<br /><br />Benzo should be used for anxiety not for fun.&nbsp;

				Yeah benzos arn&#039;t fun unless combined with alcohol and then they are just sloppy.

As far a therapetuic benzo valium is my favorite though.<br /><br />Ive been though week long xanax withdrawal, while coming off alcohol simultaneously. Shit is no joke.

				+1 to Painbow.<br /><br />I&#039;m still not entirely sure why people take valium to get high. Valium belongs to a class of drugs (benzodiazepines) that literally have the opposite effect. Benzo&#039;s are GABA receptor agonists which increase the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA - causing an increased sedative-like effect. <br /><br />Benzo&#039;s have terrible long-term effects, especially on cognitive function, tolerance buildup is very quick - which makes them essentially useless for long-term use, and their withdrawal effects are brutal.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for a euphoric high, try MDMA.<br /><br />And for the love of the God that doesn&#039;t exist, do not combine benzos with alcohol.<br /><br />sdesu

				You guys are ridiculous, do you even use the drug? Or just read a pamphlet and start preaching your opinions? Benzos are widely known and used as a recreational drug.

This guy never said &quot;Hey, I want some valium and I want to get addicted and drink alcohol on them and only do them for euphoria&quot;, this is all your assumptions.

Obviously you can get intoxicated by using a couple of tablets of valium, but what exactly is the benefit over taking a couple of drinks?<br /><br />I&#039;ve always found the purely recreational use of benzo&#039;s a bit confusing. Valium is bascially a pure downer, which may give you a bit on euforia on the way between stumbling into your bed and falling asleep. I&#039;d say alcohol compares favorably in that effect though, since it will at least get you nice and chatty/happy/gitty before putting your lights out after a large enough dose. <br /><br />I think most people that order benzo&#039;s on SR do so either to <br /><br />- treat anxiety or insomnia problems due to a physician refusing to prescribe them<br />- emergency measure to &#039;cancel&#039; a bad trip caused by another substance, mostly hallucinogens <br /><br />As a recreational drug on its own, i&#039;d score valium 1 out of 10 - the positive side is very limited at best, while the risk of addiction is quite realistic with frequent use. <br /><br />If you want to experience what taking 20/30 mg of valium feels like, proceed and try some time, i&#039;m quite sure you&#039;ll realize its not a substance to have some fun on. You will, probably, get a well deserved night of good sleep out of it ;)

				As far as benzos and pure recreational value, I think they do have some, just not&nbsp; a whole lot on their own. They definitely can make social situations more enjoyable as they loosen your tongue.&nbsp; But the recreational value they do have occurs in combinations with other substances in my opinion, most notably weed and booze. Because marijuana can often make people a bit anxious/paranoid especially in high doses, the combo of a couple valium(for example) and some good weed is an extremely enjoyable and relaxing buzz. You toss 3-6 beers into the mix, and that trifecta can produce a pretty amazing buzz/body high in my experience. But I do agree that benzos completely by themselves don&#039;t produce a whole lot of euphoria, more so just relaxation and sedation. But as I mentioned earlier that state of relaxation free from anxieties can feel quite euphoric to certain people, although its not a &quot;high&quot; in the same sense as other drugs.

				^Yeah I enjoy the script speedball as well. I&#039;m prescribed Vyvanse and occasionally prescibed valium or k pin for my anxiety disorder, I do indeed enjoy that combo and its not as unhealthy as it might sound, my conservative doctor approved it.

				lol, yea i know the typical speedball of cocaine and heroin is extremely hard on the heart and i avoid using opiates and stims together.<br /><br />but given how frequently amphetamine and benzos are prescribed together i will indulge in a pharma speedball occasionally without fear of too much stress or damage to my body.&nbsp; cocaine is just hard on the heart already, and opiates impact downstream adrenergic signaling which sends contradictory messages... but GABA plays a much smaller role in cardiac processes<br /><br />i also enjoy a benzo when coming down off psychedelics... produces a similar effect and the comedown is just phenomenal and lovely instead of feeling like crap

I had a doctor who was an expert in alcohol withdrawal at the ER tell me Vyvanse and Valium was perfectly fine together, after I had been treated for a substance abuse issue (acute alcohol WD, I get baad hangovers.) Yeah Pharms are addictive but there just not as toxic n sketchy as Heroin and Cocaine and MDMA and Meth (crystal Meth) etc.
