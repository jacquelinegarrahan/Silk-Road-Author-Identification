				Is there any cross tolerance between speed(amphetamine) and mdma? If so, how long should i wait to take speed(amphetamine) after consumed mdma?<br />Is there any harsh comedown from taking speed(amphetamine)? If so, is it feeling the same as mdma harsh comedown?<br /><br />Any extra info are much appreciated <br /><br />Peace!

Best to avoid consuming them together because of increased likelyhood of neurotoxicity and probably a worse comedown. I&#039;ve consumed both in the same day with no issue, but probably not the best idea. If you take them close together, keep the amp dose low and MDMA dose reasonable, or else you might have a bad time.<br /><br />As far as how long to wait to consume amp after MDMA, you&#039;ll have to use your own discretion. I&#039;d suggest against taking amp the same night as MDMA, but taking a reasonable dose the following day shouldn&#039;t be an issue if you&#039;ve taken care of your self (sleep and nutrtion). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40531.msg446724#msg446724">Quote from: pakaibuang on September 03, 2012, 07:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is there any harsh comedown from taking speed(amphetamine)?

Personally, I find the comedown from amphetamine to be tolerable when consumed orally at reasonable doses (&lt;60 mg). Beyond that, I find the high less pleasant and comedown much harsher. Snorting amphetamine has usually produces a shorter, though more intense high, but a much harsher comedown. <br /><br />Interestingly, I find the comedown from methamphetamine to be much more tolerable than amphetamine itself. <br /><br />In terms of comparing it to MDMA, I&#039;ve never had a harsh comedown with MDMA (with the exception of one occasion where I also drank alot of alcohol). Quite the opposite in fact. IME, amphetamine/methamphetamine comedown is a different beast. MDMA typically leaves me with a warm afterglow for the next day or two, whereas amphetamines usually make me groggy or grumpy due to interupted sleep cycles. It also can leave you feeling a bit fiendish for more. But your mileage will vary.<br /><br />But one thing to keep in mind with amphetamines is that the majority of any harsh comedown is the result of lack of nutrtion and sleep deprivation. <br /><br />I&#039;ve found that I can totally erradicate any amphetamine comedown with low dose benzodiazepine (I prefer 0.5 mg clonazepine). Benzos are a life saver.<br /><br />A meal before bed and upon waking, with lots of water helps a great deal as well. V8 juice or V8 splash is a miracle drink for recovery (and during use too). <br /><br />If you avoid staying up all night, and limit your benders to 48 hrs on the extreme side (along with adequate nutrition), you&#039;ll find the crash is quite manageable. Especially with benzos on hand. I tend to avoid amphetamines if I don&#039;t have benzos or GHB. <br /><br />All the best :)<br />

				In my experience taking MDMA the day after taking an amphetamine results in a less satisfactory MDMA experience. There seems to be a lessening of the two or three hour peak and a deadening of the bonhomie and wellbeing that MDMA often brings about. The extent of my experimentation with this is quite shallow, having only done it five or six times, but each time the MDMA experience has been pleasant and rewarding, but not the same as if it was taken after a few weeks of no serotonin/dopamine active compounds.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve observed people take MDMA after two days on methamphetamine with a forced sleep of five hours using quietiapine, and their experience completely lacked the magic associated with MDMA usage, and they reported that they&#039;d only felt more &quot;fucked up on drugs&quot; than they had with only the amphetamine.<br />&nbsp; I only have one experience with a stimulant after MDMA, and it was 100 mg of methamphetamine the day after taking MDMA. I&#039;d had six hours of sleep, and there was a slight lessening of the euphoric onset of the methamphetamine but the duration and general effects seemed the same.<br /><br />Because both compounds employ similar mechanisms in the brain it is likely that taking one will lessen the effect of the other. The damping effect is likely to increase with more aggressive usage of either compound.
