				<br />One more reason to buy Weed direct from the growers: Glass powder contamination!<br /><br />I had heard of it before, but never first hand. Smugglers that bring weed across borders also have developed a habit of contaminating the weed to increase the weight. With every kilo worth $5k-$9k to them, adding 20% to the weight adds up in profit.<br /><br />I was talking to people that wanted to buy from me to transport it to the UK, and they casually mentioned why they could offer much better prices than coffeeshops here. They add powdered glass to the weed to increase the weight. Not sure what percentage extra they get but apparently enough to make it worthwhile to them.<br /><br />Obviously terrible for the smoker, you end up inhaling molten bits of glass, so hot that they damage your throat. Not that they care. Growers wouldn&#039;t be seen dead doing something like that, you don&#039;t care for plants quality for ten weeks or more just to ruin it at the end.<br /><br />So one more reason to get it on SR straight from the source and not via the long chain of grower, smuggler, seller etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone with experience finding glass powder in weed?<br /><br />I am a grower and I am selling the nicest stuff&nbsp; :D, <br />promotion of $80 for 10g (eq. of $224 per ounce, very low). Have a look:<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9931<br />

				I am familiar with this story about glass contaminated cannabis on the streets of the UK. I am not trying to disprove you but I believe this story was actually a bit of drug enforcement propaganda. <br />They were saying people were ending up in hospitals with severe lung damage from glass contaminated weed. However, now correct me if I&#039;m wrong, I remember reading that it was not really true. Some jack-off punter has maybe tried it once, but if you are trying to make money importing weed from NL, then put glass in it, you would never be able to sell it because as soon as it gets sampled and sends people to the hospital they would never buy it. <br />On the street level, same problem. If some dude was putting glass in crap weed to make it look more crystally and heavyier, he would loose all his business<br />This is mostly believed to be scare tactic thought up by LE after maybe it had happened once before. A Sheriff in US heard about it and started telling the same story in the US even though there was never any case of it ever reported. One US County actually outlawed inhaling fermenting feces and urine after a fake report of kids pooping into bags, letting them rot a little, then inhaling the fumes. That one was hilarious. I bet it&#039;s a good buzz.

				Here in Australia growers sell it to the big syndicates who now mix gravy mix (gravox) with buds to give them a brown appearance, makes them heavy in weight and when dried forms like little crystals to deceive the buyer into thinking they are buying strong bud. If anyone ever is sold brown bud that has a powder resin refuse to pay for it. It&#039;s also a really bad smoke and the potency, or whatever small amount the buds had, is not there. <br /><br />It&#039;s a disgusting practice, but then again scumbag drug dealers in australia use any method possible to undercut people and sell crap. Pills being sold as MDMA which contain no MDMA and just a concoction of cheap pharmaceuticals. <br /><br />Also never ever buy drugs in Australia that has been distributing by bikie gangs. Apart from being on the same level as toe jam these pricks will sell you paint thinner disguised as heroin.

				it was a HUGE problem here in the uk a few years ago, i even know why it happened, here in old blighty people have been paying £20 an 1/8th since i started smoking weed and that was about 15 years ago, despite the price of electric, feed, lights pots etc all going up in those years people still wanted their 3.5g dead for twenty pounds and griped and whined when they got a &quot;short&quot; henry, so the commercial lot found a way to make the weed heavier, during those awful days i saw substances like sand, silicon spray, glass, paint, sugar, salt and various other substances. thankfully after a few years people decided they were willing to pay that bit more for weed that wasnt going to do you serious harm and it now sells at pretty much £10 a gram so in some cases SR is actually cheaper and in some cases better weed than you can get locally, i can site Holland and hopefully soon Blaazt0r as people selling better weed than i can get on the streets for cheaper than i can get it (£6-7 a gram for top notch properly cured bud, and no fooking big bits of stalk filling the weight out either) i just wish i had the kind of cash to buy it in big amounts

				profspudhead is right, and sorry sickboy but you&#039;re wrong. I&#039;d say about 5 years ago batches of adulterated buds started to appear. They just didn&#039;t look right. If you looked at them under a microscope you could see perfect, round beads. If you rubbed your fingers on the buds, and then licked your fingers, you&#039;d be able to feel the beads crunching between your teeth. I can tell you from my own personal experience that this is true, because I bought some, and so did many of my friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how related it was, but pretty soon after this stuff became widespread, hashes started to become much better available in my area. Every cloud has a silver lining, as they say!<br /><br />If you&#039;re worried, do the crunch test. If it crunches, take it back to the dealer and ask for your money back. If it&#039;s from SR, expose the seller.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s much of it about any more but then again, I only smoke hash now so I suppose I wouldn&#039;t know.

				Thumbs up for the Dam, where you can get whole ungrounded buds.<br /><br />If there is glass, shake the package and look for any abnormal glass-like powder dropping to the bottom in the package.

				I have yet to encounter any adulterated marijuana state-side. If you could, please get your hands on some of it and take pictures under the microscope, I&#039;m sure the entire community would benefit from such efforts as these reports always seem vague and unsupported

You could do the crunch test just by rubbing your finger on the bag and then putting it into your mouth. <br /><br />Actually NL is where the contaminated weed came from... at first at least. You&#039;re right though that as a consumer in Holland you are very unlikely to find it. It was a UK import issue. NL commercial growers got pissed off with UK smugglers refusing to pay more than a certain amount per kilo, and so sold them kilos made up of let&#039;s say 900g buds and 100g glass. Disgusting... but let&#039;s not pretend that the UK smugglers were the victims of the evil NL growers here! I am absolutely sure they knew what was going on and were complicit.<br /><br />And don&#039;t get me wrong -&nbsp; NL weed is excellent. As I said this was purely a UK import issue, caused by our own refusal to accept price increases. To my knowledge it doesn&#039;t happen any more because prices have now gone up. But I may be wrong.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3939.msg53596#msg53596">Quote from: NOC3 on November 30, 2011, 05:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have yet to encounter any adulterated marijuana state-side.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lucky you, let&#039;s hope it stays that way! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you could, please get your hands on some of it and take pictures under the microscope, I&#039;m sure the entire community would benefit from such efforts as these reports always seem vague and unsupported<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of it about any more... but if I find some I&#039;ll send you a PM so you can throw come coins my way.

				http://thepoorhouse.org.uk/files/images/glassgrassbig.preview.jpg<br /><br />In other news I have a hookup that&#039;s £20 for an 1/8th of weed without stems or anything. It could be slightly underweight though since I didn&#039;t have a scale last time I bought from that source.

				Obviously ANY contamination in weed is unacceptable and should not be tolerated, but I just wanted to clarify something. If the contamination actually is truly glass, then you will not &quot;end up inhaling molten bits of glass.&quot; You may end up inhaling finely powdered glass that becomes airborne which could be extremely harmful still if you were not using a water piece. However, temperatures hot enough to turn the glass into a molten state (at least 2000 deg F) or to vaporize the glass simply will not be nearly approached by any smoking method. Think about it, the temperature of the air being inhaled would be so hot your lungs would be completely burned and the glass bowl being used to smoke would become molten as well. Oh shit, the bowl is burning a whole through my leg. Now this is some shitty weed&nbsp; :P<br /><br />This is why even if a small amount of lye (boiling point 2530 degrees F) remains in a dmt extraction that is smoked, no toxic affects will be present in the smoke (assuming you dont inhale the actual powder or ash...) Not that anyone should be smoking an extraction done by a person incompetent enough to pull the basic layer with the non-polar...

				I haven&#039;t come across grit weed for about 3 years here. Back in 2006 when the weed first appeared, some UKCIA forum members sent a lot of emails to the home office, charities etc but no one seemed interested. A certain forum member performed an analysis of the abrasive material and within a week the home office issued a warning without any acknowledgement of where the &#039;reports&#039; had originated.&nbsp; ;D<br />As far as I can remember the glass turned out to be micrometer glass beads which are used in abrasive high pressure sprays for metal finishing and the like.. Later, larger particles were used which used to fall from the bud and collect at the bottom of the baggie. The most insidious was a short burst of glass fibre sprayed pot which was cheap and thus bought by young teens in my area, very scary.

				http://www.ukcia.org/forum/read.php?10,9282,page=13<br /><br />and yeah myolddutch, soap bar still does the rounds, it tends to be lighter and a little less densely pressed than the shit old stuff but I&#039;ve bought some recently as &#039;mid grade hash&#039; and was pulling chunks of cellophane out of it, didn&#039;t smoke much of it<br /><br />an amusing side note, a friend was selling small scale a few years ago and bought a half kg of soap bar. As he was cutting it up he noticed something yellow poking out of it which on further inspection was the head of a LEGO man&nbsp; ;D there was a load more in the same block. someone must have chucked a handful in before pressing to make up the weight. ???
