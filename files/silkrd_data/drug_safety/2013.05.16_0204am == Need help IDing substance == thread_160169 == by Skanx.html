				I have a substance thats supposed to be K but when I used a mandelin reagent there was no reaction. So I decided to test it again with a marquis reagent and it turned yellow. What could it be? I know cathinones turn yellow with marquis but why would someone try to pass off a cathinone for K? Anyone got any suggestions?

				your on the right track MDPV, Methylone, Butylone, and very-weak/cut DOB &amp; DOI are the only ones ive seen, I checked the rc color chart for marquis and mandelin and I did not see any others.&nbsp; As for why someone would pass that off who knows? Just be glad you tested it first
