				Ok, so I have some MDMA capsules for PERSONAL use, I don&#039;t sell that stuff. I&#039;d rather not go to jail for a felony.<br />My technique is to disguise the capsules in a &quot;Supplement&quot; bottle.<br />2 questions.<br /><br />First, what supplement is least likely to be noticed or eaten by any nosey roommates? I want ot keep this bottle in my room but do not want to have any rick that somone possibly searching through my shit would find this bottle and decide that they need supplelemt. I&#039;,m thinking ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid).<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, 170-200mg of MDMA does not fully fill a capsule, what COMPLETELY inert&nbsp; substance should I fill the rest of the capsule with so that it looks like a legitimate supplement. I was thinking flour might work well, though a friend of mine suggested that flour might weaken the roll a tiny bit, in the same way eating a piece of bread would. I also though maybe vitamin C, though it will need to be white and I&#039;m afraid that Vit-C might be expensive and again, affect the roll.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				Well, vitamin C is a good bet, both for color and lack of ill effects. I don&#039;t know about the supplement method overall though. I&#039;m pretty sure that it has been officially played out, depends I guess on who you are hiding it from. honestly I would find something else.. how many caps are we talking?

				Does anyone have a better method?<br /><br />I&#039;m working with somewhere between 20 and 30 capsules. I use 4 per year, so this is long term storage.<br />I&#039;m really just hiding it from my landlords, the cleaning lady, and/or roommates. (1 of them is my best friend, the other is almost a stranger)

				Well, in that case I would say that you supplement idea is likely adequate (if time consuming) as your roomies I assume aren&#039;t junkies or anyone used to digging around other peoples shit for drugs. Without sitting in your room I&#039;m having a hard time with any foolproof alternatives as I usually am dealing with commercial sized hides. Gimme a bit and I&#039;ll check my brain harder.. Is there a reason that a simple combo lockbox would be out of the question?

				The combo lockbox is a little difficult to get to in a an emergency, like if I needed to dispose of something quickly.<br />Also, somewhat expensive and it&#039;s suspicious (makes people think &quot;Gee I wonder what&#039;s in there&quot;).<br /><br />I have various other drugs too, but they are all hidden pretty well. I just want a nice foolproof way to store my capsules for about 7 years as I and my fiance work our way through them.

				Ah, sorry, I see that we are coming from opposite spectrums here haha.. Seven years.. Ok, well I would want my gear vacuum sealed for such a long journey, but I assume that a vac sealer is out of the question as it isn&#039;t something most have lying around. Do you have an appliance or tv/stereo or something who&#039;s case you could pop open and poke around for voids (away from heat)? I have found that sometimes taking the faceplate off of an outlet or switch can expose available space in your wall if the drywall guys weren&#039;t too retentive.. I have a small emegency wall stash in a place right now actually.

				Dextrose is a good bet. But one could always just grind up some calsium tablets and use those.

				I would go with Flavonoids like Naringin or Hesperetin, which not only disguise the drug but also enhance metabolism and increase their bioavailability.<br />Google:<br />&quot;citrus bioflavonoid complex&quot;<br />If you want to go even cheaper search Ebay for:<br />&quot;grapefruit peel powder&quot;<br />This one will give you an additional great smell. :)<br /><br />I doubt your landlord or your maid have a clue what Bioflavonoids are and would be vary to try it.

				Just hide it anywhere<br /><br />Why does it have to be a supplement bottle, put it in a baggy and put it in a pocket of some jeans that are hidden away

Subterfuge is better than discretion.<br /><br />Also, if someone were to rifle through my room (not that they would, but just in case) and they found a baggy of 3/4 full capsules in a jacket that is VERY suspicious looking. However, if they find a bunch of bottles of supplements that is much less suspicious, especially since one of my roommates is a body builder and runs a vitamin shop (we have supplement bottles everywhere).

				Honestly, it sucks that you can&#039;t trust your roomies to just accept your 2 pill a year habit should they snoop rudely through your shit.. at the end of the day a man shouldn&#039;t have to worry about having some innocent Ecstasy tucked away in his personals imo&nbsp; ::)<br />
