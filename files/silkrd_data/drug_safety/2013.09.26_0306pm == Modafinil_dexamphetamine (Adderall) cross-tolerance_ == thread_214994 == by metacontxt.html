				Does anyone know about this? <br /><br />After using Modafinil on and off over a period of about 4 months, I now need to take about twice as much as I did when I first took it. <br /><br />It seems that my tolerance to dexamphetamine or dextroamphetamine (which I use much much more infrequently) has also increased by a similar amount even though the small amounts I&#039;ve been taking and the months-long breaks between using don&#039;t really explain to me why my dex tolerance would have gone up so much.<br /><br />I know they&#039;re different drugs, but it seems to me that is some relation between their mechanism of action or whatever it is in the brain that they tweak. If I use dexies two days in a row, on the second day I don&#039;t get much of a buzz and they&#039;re less effective for concentration. If I take modafinil on one day and dexies the next, I get the same reduced effectiveness of dexies the day after taking modafinil. <br /><br />Anyone else have any experience with these two drugs?

				I have no access to Adderall but speed, and taking Modafinil quite regularly.<br />I experienced the same thing, the same dose of amp does less to you if you have taken Modafinil even some days before.<br />I get the same with Cannabis. I get a weaker effect on Modafinil (less couch locky and I like it more), but this is another story and I guess it&#039;s quite obvious given the effects of Modafinil. What a great invention it is!

				Sure but not during 30+ day breaks. <br /><br />&quot;I get the same with Cannabis. I get a weaker effect on Modafinil (less couch locky and I like it more)&quot;<br /><br />I can see why that would be a good thing with gunga - less so with dex when you&#039;re taking it to power through some work but it&#039;s not quite giving you that familiar kick in the arse to get you going :)

				My tolerance has me puzzled I just asked the Dr about it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do any during the week only weekends and when I had the phosphate salt other people were up all night and day on 80mg I was up all night too but it took me 500mg.<br /><br />I used to really bash it a Decade ago and wondering if my brain is still remembering those days or something as I think a lot of people in the amphet thread think they would be dead on half a gram of that in say 18 hours - just don&#039;t understand why I seem to need 4 x the amount everyone else is taking love to just take 100mg and that is that.
