				Ok, quick question. I have a friend that has had an arrhythmic episode before. She believes it was a heart attack but I doubt this as it lasted 4 hours and while the symptoms were similar she did not go to a hospital until afterwards and they never scanned her or ran many test.<br /><br />Either way, she drinks a monster daily, and has had up to 800mg caffeine (on accident) without having any severe heart issues (other than a racing heart).<br />Shes used 2c-i, 2c-e, and even 2c-p a multitude of times and was fine.<br /><br />She&#039;s scared of the vasoconstriction from 25i NBOMe putting too much strain on her heart, so we are planning on taking 25c.<br /><br />Do you think she will be ok?<br />How severe is the vasoconstriction from 25c?<br />How severe is 25i?<br /><br />(if it helps she&#039;ll be taking a blotter of roughly 800 mcg, with no HPBCD complexing)

				Someone who consumes that much caffeine shouldn&#039;t be worrying about NBOMe she should chill with her caffeine intake.<br />That said I experienced no vasoconstriction on 25c, 600-1200µg w/ HPBCD and neither have any of my friends that have taken it.<br />I&#039;m more concerned about 25i vasoconstriction but neither me or my friend that I took it with noticed any at a 1mg dose w/ HPBCD.<br />I&#039;m not sure how comfortable I would be going higher with 25i, but I think 3-4 tabs on 25c would be OK health-wise, although I don&#039;t think I would like the mental stimulation that high.<br />at 800µg w/o HPBCD the absorption rate is going to be somewhere between 40-60% so it&#039;ll be closer to a very borderline experience then an overwhelming one, Its possible that she will only feel very mild effects. I highly doubt she has to worry about vasoconstriction from that small a dose.

				Well these are samples from Family. He claimed them as 1mg per blotters. however they vary in size/ From what I&#039;ve been told the larger ones are 1mg, so then the smaller one are probably closer to 800 mcg.

				I had some of the worst vasoconstriction in my life off 25-i-nbome. I thourhgt i was dying off one tab. It was really shitty, but because of how amazing the actual trip was (besides the part where i thought i was loosing my limbs.) i had to give 25-i-nbome another try. By the fifth time i had used 25i, i didn&#039;t have nearly as bad vasoconstricion or body load. The nbome chems are weird in the sense that your body becomes tolerant of the side effects.

				If you have any doubts whatsoever with your heart and 25i, DONT take it! My entire family has died of heart disease, so I&#039;m pretty f**ked in that department, however I&#039;m only 20 so I&#039;d like to think I have a few years left, and let me tell you my heart is permanently f**ked from 25i. Can still feel it aching as I type.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve taken it 3 times, and that was 3 times too many, I took half the dose the last time I did it and that still sent my heart into a raging throb. F**king hurt all night. Completely ruined the effects of the trip. I&#039;ve got a natural high tolerance to stimulants - caffeine, pre-workouts, nicotine etc. - but 25i is just on another level. It&#039;s insane.<br /><br />So yeah...if you really are doubting your hearts ability to keep up with this stuff...then just play it safe and go for something else. 25i was my first psychadelic and it&#039;s really ruined the experience for me.

				Guys, tell me if there are some ways to block heart effects of 25i. I&#039;d really enjoy tripping on those if only it stops fucking up my blood pressure.

				I&#039;ve tried 800ug and 1.6mg of 25-C and experienced vasoconstriction both times. I didn&#039;t notice it as badly the second time around, even with the double dose, but I had all kinds of insulation and heating going, so can&#039;t say whether I may be acclimatizing to it or if I just did a better job of taking care.

				Just about every psychodrug in existence will release some level of dopamine which breaks down into norepipenhrine which binds to the B1 and alpha receptor on the heart and arteries and will cause vasoconstriction. The question is how dopaminergic is the 25 series? I don&#039;t know the answer to that but if she is having this bad of heart problems I advise abstaining from ALL drugs for a while.
