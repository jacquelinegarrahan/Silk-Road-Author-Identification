				I&#039;m a relatively-new coke user, have used both shitty &quot;street&quot; coke locally, and more high-end, supposedly uncut coke from the Road. There seem to be a lot of people on here who seem to be able to tell which cuts are in a particular batch of coke just by sampling it. I was just wondering, what are some of the side effects of all the common cocaine cuts? I know mannitol tends to give people the shits. I&#039;ve never experienced this from any coke I&#039;ve done personally. The only unusual effect I&#039;ve ever experienced from doing coke was an extremely dry throat from some supposedly pure cocaine. Any idea what that could be from? No other batch has had that effect on me. <br /><br />While I tend to only buy coke on the Road that claims to be uncut, I don&#039;t trust these claims 100% and tend to assume that it&#039;s cut with something.
