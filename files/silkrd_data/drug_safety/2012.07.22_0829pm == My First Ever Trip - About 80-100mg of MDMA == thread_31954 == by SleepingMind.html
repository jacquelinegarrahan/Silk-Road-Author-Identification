				This was my first trip on any drug. So, I do not have any base for comparison and that&#039;s why I kept notes every few minutes so that it becomes my base. I tripped alone at my home around mid-night so that there won&#039;t be any disturbance from any of the family members.<br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />09:35 PM - Dinner Complete. <br /><br />09:45 PM - Took 100mg 5-HTP, once Multi-vitamin and one magnesium <br /><br />12:18 AM - I used a pill cutter to split SuperTrips &#039;200mg White XTC Speakers&#039;. Took one half of that orally with water. I think it was about 80-100mg.<br /><br />01:05 AM - Sudden rush of some chill feeling ran through the whole body. It was little more intense on my legs. This is the first sign of the drug effect.<br /><br />01:20 AM - Another rush of chill feeling. Top part of the body seems to be warming up a bit.<br /><br />01:30 AM - Skin has become sensitive to touch. So far I have been sitting on my chair. Now the overall feeling was making me get up and do something. I feel little restless.<br /><br />01:40 AM - Now I feel that sound intensity has increased. I was listening to music using a headphone. So, I stopped that and took a walk around the house. Now I can hear very frequency sound. I could clearly hear the sound of my walking. The light is more vivid. I can see a whole lot more in the dark. So, I guess my pupil has dilated a lot at this point in time. The street light right across my window is brighter now.&nbsp; Color seems little more saturated. My skin sensitivity is still there and my body temperature seems little more than usual. <br /><br />01:50 AM - Now I have a chill feeling and also a general warm up feeling throughout the body. It feels I need to do some physical activity. So started walking around the house again. The color has certainly become more vivid and saturated. There was an old baby blanket that never attracted my attention. But now looks so beautiful. In general the mundane household stuff looked lot more interesting.<br /><br />02:20 AM - It felt better as long as I kept doing some physical activity. Sitting idle was making it little awkward. Felt quite warm up especially around the head/neck area. The body temperature seems quite high. So, went to bathroom to wash my face/neck with cold water and that made me feel lot better. The sound from the water flowing from tap felt lore more intense and fuller.<br /><br />02:30 AM - It feels like focusing visually on any particular object has become little more difficult than usual. Time seems to have slowed down a bit.<br /><br />02:50 AM - It definitely made me physically more active and it feels better as long I kept doing something like walking, moving, etc. I can see more in darkness and the whole house seems lot more noisier than usual. <br /><br />03:15 AM - There seems to be a calm feeling everywhere around&nbsp; me. It does not feel that weird not walking/moving any more. I made few phone calls around this time. Kept the conversations short. Went back to walking again.<br /><br />04:10 Am - The chill/calm feeling is still there, I can sit idle for few minutes without feeling bad/weird.<br /><br />04:30 AM - I am feeling a bit sleepy.<br /><br />05:20 AM - Sleepy feeling is still there.<br /><br />05:45 AM - I felt hungry and took a donut. <br /><br />05:55 AM - I did not feel any drastic change in overall feeling. But I thought I was close to the 6-hour mark so I took 200 5-HTP and 1000mg Vitamin C.<br /><br />06:20 AM - The overall calm/chill filling is little less. So, I took One multi-vitamin at this time.<br /><br />06:40 AM - I felt little tired and sleepy and went to bed. I think I fell asleep within 5-7 minutes.<br /><br />10:40 AM - Woke up quite refreshed. Thought the dreams were lot more pleasant.<br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />During the whole trip I did not have much of a euphoric feeling or talkative. But had a general calmness throughout. Did not feel too high or something. But I felt little more openness during the short conversations I had on the phone. There was no sexual feeling whatsoever. The come down was very smooth.<br /><br />It has been several hours since the trip and I feel that I still have the ability to hear low frequency sound. Not sure how long it&#039;s going to be there but for now I feel good about it. <br /><br />It would be nice to hear your thoughts on this ability to hear low frequency sound. Is this permanent?<br /><br />During the whole trip I kept drinking water and sports drinks. I took almost a little of water and about 590ml of sports drinks.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />SleepingMind

				You shouldn&#039;t really take 5HTP unless you really have too at least 24hrs before the roll, it some what dampens the effects of the mdma. <br />But interesting read bro. :)

				100mg of the purest crystal would cause the exact same effects you have described whether I rolled once a month for 6 months or haven&#039;t rolled at all for 6 months.&nbsp; I find the empathy truely arrives at the 160mg + dose.&nbsp; Give it a month and give it another swing. ;) 100mg is light imo.

				I wouldn&#039;t call taking MDMA &#039;tripping&#039;, but rather, &#039;rolling/thizzing&#039;.&nbsp; Tripping(to me at least) implies frying(inebriated with a psychedelic).<br /><br />Super glad you had a good time!&nbsp; I consider myself rather experienced with MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken as many as 9 bombs in a night, but not NEARLY as good as the White Speakers.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t rolled in ~6 months and I rolled my face off on 1 White Speaker. half at a time and spaced an hour apart.<br /><br />When i said i consider myself &#039;rather experienced&#039; with MDMA it&#039;s because i have taken more than anyone i know except for the group of friends that introduced it to me.&nbsp; I WATCHED two of them eat 26 and 29 respectively in one night.&nbsp; Anyways i gave 1/2 to one of those two people(granted he hasn&#039;t rolled in almost 2 years), and he was enjoying the FUCK out of it. he said it was one of the best he&#039;s ever had, right up there with the yellow mickeys(he said maybe even better!). :P Dunno if any of you guys know about the yellow speakers from a few years go..?
