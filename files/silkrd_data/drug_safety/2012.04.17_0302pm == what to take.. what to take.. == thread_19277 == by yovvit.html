				So I&#039;m going camping with about 9 other people soon, all of whom are virgins when it comes to drugs except for 2 or 3, and they all want me to get some weed. While I do love my Mary Jane, I want some other entertainment too, just to give you a bit of background I&#039;ve done LSD, salvia, 2cb and of course weed.<br /><br />I was thinking about either shrooms or mdma? I&#039;m bringing my boombox and I&#039;ve heard both of these drugs are great with music, the problem is I only order domestically and I&#039;ve only ever seen shrooms in my country once on here since January. Can anyone vouch for either of these in the setting I&#039;ve described? Or vouch for something else?! any feedback is highly appreciated :)<br /><br />As a footnote, it will probably be me and one or two others doing this extra drug once I decide on it, so I won&#039;t be taking it by myself.

				I&#039;d go with mdma! Sounds like the perfecting setting, and just enough people ;). Also if you&#039;re bringing weed, mdma goes great with that! Though since you&#039;re a first timer go easy on the weed. Seriously, it makes mdma much much stronger and much more euphoric as well (in my opinion) I&#039;ve always found weed to be the perfect drug enhancer... Goes well with nearly everything I take. Though weed on its own is rather dull to me. You could go with the shrooms, but I&#039;ve never had shrooms... So I can&#039;t really give an opinion on that.

				I&#039;d go with MDMA as well. I just think there&#039;s a better chance of everyone having a good time if you&#039;re only taking small doses of MDMA versus any kind of hallucinogen. Don&#039;t get me wrong--shrooms are great--but since most of your friends on this trip are complete newbies to all types of drugs, I wouldn&#039;t necessarily trust everything to go entirely smoothly. I definitely wouldn&#039;t want to be out in the woods somewhere and have one of my friends freak out or need a babysitter all night or not have any benzos on hand to calm someone down or not have a familiar, comfortable place to take someone if they need it, etc...there are just too many variables. Since it sounds like everyone is going to be trying something new that night, be it weed or the shrooms/MDMA, I&#039;d want to minimize risks as much as possible while still having a good time. <br /><br />The other thing is that MDMA will almost certainly make you more social, whereas shrooms may make you want to just go off by yourself for a while. Truthfully, I&#039;ve had times on high doses of pure MDMA that have made me completely blissed out to the point where I couldn&#039;t really talk or move. I could only lay there and let the waves of euphoria wash over me, but I definitely wasn&#039;t complaining. Anything ~100mg (or even less) of good MDMA should still make you feel really, really fucking good, but you&#039;ll still want to interact with your friends. <br /><br />Also, if you have easy access to some benzos, I&#039;d bring a few along for the trip. I try to keep some on hand no matter what drugs people are doing, especially if it&#039;s their first time, and even more so if I&#039;m the one exposing people to a new substance. You never know what kind of reaction somebody is going to have and it&#039;s nice to be able to immediately calm someone down if necessary. This is more important if you&#039;re tripping or something, but just good practice in general, I think. If nothing else, it always makes the entire experience a little more relaxing to know there&#039;s an easy &quot;out&quot; if needed. <br /><br />Good luck and I hope you have a great time!<br /><br />P.S. You should still take shrooms in the woods with a few friends a different time. It will be awesome--just probably better suited for a smaller crowd/maybe during the day.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />

				@bwompah thanks very much, I will go for the MDMA :) it would just be the few of us who&#039;ve done hallucinogens doing either of the drugs, but I&#039;ll still take your advice. Where can I get hold of benzos?

				Going with MDMA as previous speakers have advised is a wise choice. Shrooms is mostly introvert and not something you&#039;d want to try with many people your first time. If I&#039;m shrooming ever again, I&#039;ll do it solo. MDMA I want to do with friends and MDMA is also something that never (afaik) fails.

				I just went camping as well with 15 people and we all did 100mg of MDMA with 10mg of 2ci and everyone had a blast! I seriously never knew the moon was so bright before&nbsp; :D

				Thank you all for the replies :) will 100mg of MDMA suffice? should I take more? I&#039;m a noob when it comes to MDMA. I was also possibly thinking of candyflipping but I doubt I will. Thanks again.

				Yeah, 100mg of any quality stuff should be good. I probably wouldn&#039;t do much more since it&#039;ll be your first time and you wanna be functional with your friends around. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re getting MDMA off SR, so chances are it&#039;ll be pretty damn potent if you&#039;ve done any research on the vendors at all before ordering.
