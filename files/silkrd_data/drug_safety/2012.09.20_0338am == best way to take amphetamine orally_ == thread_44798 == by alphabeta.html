				i want to take amphetamine sulphate of relatively high purity e.g from boymaster orally but i don&#039;t have a scales. whats the best way to accurately measure the doses? i was thinking some sort of liquid solution but everclear isnt available here. i want to take lowish doses as i want it to help with productivity more than an euphoric effect.i also want it to hold for awhile if i didn&#039;t use it all in a short period. <br /><br /><br />i did a search but didn&#039;t come with much for taking speed in this manner. a poor mans version of an adderall alternative is what im aiming for. <br /><br />any ideas appreciated <br />thanks

				I would just advise taking a very small amount in 1 hour periods until you get to the point that you enjoy. The half life of speed is pretty long so its not like most psycs where your going to build a tolerance quickly and you can&#039;t just keep redosing. <br /><br />So yea I would just make some small piles that look equal and then go from there.

				Just buy mg scale. There are chinese sites like dealextreme that sell them for less than 20$, and they work reasonably well (as long as you don&#039;t need to weight out 3mg. and such).<br />

				best way to take amp orally is by using an antacid to raise the pH prior to dosing, which increases the bioavailability (amount you absorb) <br /><br />people use the size of match heads to measure H without a scale. you could probably do the same, just split the pile in half enough times, keep track what the mg should be&nbsp; or just take a small matchead, then wait, then another, till you figure out how much you need. <br /><br />i would think if you can just get high proof alcohol it would work. if its a salt (sulfate) form it should be soluble in water but i dont know about amp specifically, just chems in general
