				A close friend of mine suffers from Migraines.&nbsp; I hate to see this guy in such a state when it happens.<br /><br />The other day he asked me, &quot;Hey, can you use that fancy site of yours to help me out?&quot;<br />&quot;Sure man.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there is something.&quot;<br /><br />So the problem is there is more than &quot;something&quot; when you look at the prescription category.&nbsp; My friends and I aren&#039;t really the kind of people that take prescriptions recreationally, so my knowledge is limited.&nbsp; He said Vicodin worked before, but like I said, there are a ton of options.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this is the best choice or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />He describes (and I have witnessed) his migraines as having pretty bad nausea, closed eye visuals that are very disorienting, and just not being able to do anything from the physical pain.&nbsp; Says the frequency of these can occur once about every 2 months, or once a month if he is unlucky.&nbsp; <br /><br />He is looking for something that just puts him out for the night, and just makes the pain go away.&nbsp; Not looking for something preventative as they aren&#039;t frequent enough for such a measure.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Can you guys help me out with any advice?&nbsp; My friend and I thank you for any support.

				Relpax. http://www.relpax.com<br /><br />My gf suffers from crippling migraines (usually induced by stress and barometric pressure and allergies) and usually all she needs is half a pill. She&#039;ll take this pill and then take a little nap for an hour-ish and she claims she is pain free for at least a couple days. I would look into it for your buddy. Cause it makes a big difference for her.

				Jeez, I feel so bad. I can&#039;t imagine living with such a severe problem like that.<br /><br />Sounds similar to cluster headaches.&nbsp; Hope he finds something.&nbsp; Why doesn&#039;t he try some benzos to help knock him out or sedate him when he is having pain?

				What has he tried?<br /><br />Generally 2/month is the cut off for prophylaxis of migraines but if he can happily tolerate say some beta-blockers it might be worth it anyways.<br /><br />There are two wings to treatment of acute migraines, pain-relief and anti-nausea.<br /><br />For pain simple analgesics Aspirin, paracetamol (the disolved in water type) or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac...) opiods like most commonly codeine is used to &quot;knock people out&quot; and help with pain. You can mix these as they wont interact like 1g paracetamol 6 hourly, 400mg ibuprofen 6 hourly, 900mg aspirin 6 hourly, 40mg codeine every 4 hours all at the same time. Take the aspirin and ibuprofen with a large meal.<br /><br />Another option is 5HT1 agonist (&quot;tryptans&quot;) such as 12.5 mg of almotriptan when pin starts and then in 2 hours if it&#039;s back / continues.<br /><br />For the nausea cyclizine 50mg three times a day is good, metoclopramide is another good choice (but not for kids or women).<br /><br />Hope that helps and as always prevention is better than cure loads of common triggers, chocolate, cheese, caffeine, alcohol to name a few. http://www.patient.co.uk/health/migraine This might help.<br /><br /><br />Migraines suck hope this helps!<br /><br />I should add, don&#039;t continue this for more than a one or two days a month or you run the risk of rebound headaches which are a B ITCH! It means the meds wont work and you&#039;d end up in constant pain if you don&#039;t take them.<br />

				Thank you all for your wonderful responses.&nbsp; I even got some pm&#039;s from some noobs that can&#039;t post here yet.&nbsp; With their permission I will be posting their responses.&nbsp; Beautiful to see some caring souls.<br /><br />Yes these are cluster headaches.&nbsp; The only thing he said he tried was Vicodine, which he said worked pretty well.<br /><br />I&#039;m still looking pretty hard.&nbsp; It&#039;s extremely difficult right now as the search function is not working.&nbsp; Also trying to figure out the whole best solution/cost ratio.&nbsp; I want a good solution but $35 for an oxy is impractical.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be able to meet with him tomorrow or the next day and will show him what I have found and what you guys have presented.<br /><br />Thank you again.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to get back with what we picked and (god forbid) when the next attack happens I&#039;ll let you know the result.&nbsp;

				if they are indeed cluster headaches...the best medicine for that, is low amounts of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. not enough to trip and see visuals tho lol. but there have been studies, and I have done a research project on this, that a low dose of these mushroom will curtail these cluster headaches for long periods of time. The articles are easy to find. Another avenue for you to explore :)

If your friend doesn&#039;t mind getting high once a month or so on acid, LSD should help.&quot;<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know if the guy is down for this or not but I will certainly bring it up.&nbsp; Would be very interesting for sure if this ended up being a solution for him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just waiting for a chance to see him in person, as this is not something I feel comfortable with talking over the phone.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				I saw a documentary I forget which one.&nbsp; Maybe it was Drugs Inc Hallucinogens?<br /><br />Any way a man in the documentary used shrooms 2-3 times a month I believe and it kept his cluster headaches away.&nbsp; He had it severe too.&nbsp; He acts like he doesn&#039;t enjoy tripping but it&#039;s obvious he does when they film it&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s on youtube.

				i used to get really bad migraines when i was a child and eventually went to a high end chiropractor who said that one of the disks in my neck was slightly out of place and would pinch down on the nerve from time to time. long story short i got my neck adjusted 5-6 times and haven&#039;t had a migraine in almost 15 years! since its relatively cheap, legal and easy i recommended trying that before drugs. but if that doesn&#039;t work low doses of mushrooms once a month would be perfect. personally i would just grow a small amount, i think 1-2 harvests would be enough for a whole years treatment and would only cost $100 or so there are plenty of guides on clear net sites like shroomery and believe it or not you can buy the spores require legally on line as well as full kits with everything you need and instructions. i knew people who i went to high with that were growing them in their closets its that easy. anyway i hope he can figure out something that helps migraines are so debilitating.

You might wish to consult a medical oxygen company which provides cylinders to people requiring oxygen. I&#039;m not certain if this requires a prescription to obtain, but it is perfectly legal, and has few to no side effects. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />

				Chiropractors are bullshit. There&#039;s never been even mediocre evidence that it&#039;s more effective than placebo despite a great deal of research.<br /><br /><br />Cluster headaches are different from migraines I&#039;m truely sorry if they are cluster headaches. They are even worse than migraines. Most of the same medications will help. As someone mentioned high flow 100% oxygen can help as can hyperventilation. <br />Psilocybin is a good specific treatment I&#039;d be very interested in hearing about if he manages to harvest his own and use it successfully!<br /><br />LSD is another option however it&#039;s stigma (being class A in the UK for example) means there is great resistance to it&#039;s use. It&#039;s a great shame because any effective treatment of cluster headaches would be a god-send. It&#039;s also good for other causes of pain and end-of-life care pain/anxiety.

				I fully agree against chiropractors and any other kind of &quot;alternate medication&quot;. <br /><br />If something actually does work it will be adopted as &quot;medicine&quot; and paid for by health insurance if you have it.<br /><br />I can imagine it would be attractive to seek alternative care in such a case, but it will not do you any good. You will pay for &quot;treatment&quot; that is&nbsp; not effective.<br /><br />With problems like migraines or cluster headaches i would not recommend shopping around for medications or SR either though: most painkillers that are very effective against pain from trauma will not be effective in such cases. See a specialist about it - perhaps there is some solution in generally accepted medicine, perhaps there is not. In the latter case you can still experiment with various substances knowing that regular medicine cannot help you.

				I get bad migraines and have only found a couple of things to help.&nbsp; I built up a tolerance for OTC stuff (takes minimum 14 advil at once or 8 aleve) which left me trying to find something.&nbsp; <br /><br />What did work was taking a couple of oxy&#039;s but that gets expensive quickly.&nbsp; The other was my doctor prescribing Midrin.&nbsp; Look it up but it&#039;s non narcotic and thus pretty cheap.&nbsp; On insurance, it costs me about $7 for 50 pills.&nbsp; It worked even better than oxys for me.&nbsp; It&#039;s designed specifically for migraines.

				Migraines are NOT cluster headaches!&nbsp; Cluster headaches are worse, and generally more frequent.&nbsp; But migraines are horrible.&nbsp; I suffer greatly from them; when I get one, it&#039;s usually 10 hours of writhing in pain, visual distortions, and violent dry heaving / puking.<br /><br />Fortunately, there ARE effective ways to abort migraines! I have a prescription medication called Imitrex (sumatriptan) which gets rid of the physical pain within an hour.&nbsp; Check it out!

				I would have to second the recommendation for LSD.<br /><br />I suffer from chronic cluster headaches and migraines that come in high cycles and low cycles. During the low cycle I might have one mild headache, in comparison to the high cycle anyway, every few days. During the high cycle I get them daily, sometimes a few in a day. I&#039;ve tried several different prescription medications, both prophylactic and abortive, along with shrooms, LSD, weed, and various painkillers. None of the prophylactic medications really worked for me. The abortives, mostly triptans like Relpax and Maxalt, would work the first time I used them and then never work again.<br /><br />Opiates don&#039;t even touch the cluster headaches, I could take Oxycontin, Vicodin, morphine, or whatever and still feel like there is a spike being driven through my head.<br /><br />Mushrooms kind of work for me, but I have to dose every few days and all they really manage to do is keep me out of the high cycle. LSD on the other hand works wonderfully for me. One tab and I didn&#039;t have a single headache for a month and a half. Cannabis actually works reasonably well for me as well, so long as I can time it right. It works better for the migraines than the cluster headaches though. It gets rid of the nausea and dulls the pain enough that it doesn&#039;t really bother me.<br /><br />Energy drinks or strong coffee sometimes help if drank right when a headache starts. Staying physically active also helps keep them at bay. I work out in some fashion at least six days a week and that usually helps keep me in the low cycle. Exercise increases the amount of oxygen in the blood or something along those lines.

Why don&#039;t they do research to prove it themselves? Who do you think does the research into cancer treatments but doctors who specialize in cancer therapy? Who do you think does research to prove any medication works but the pharma company who holds the patent? That&#039;s fine so long as they do good quality studies, why don&#039;t they lie? Cause the ensuing shit storm of legal action from patients, doctors, the government and other pharma companies would backrupt them and cause their share value to drop like bitcoins. They don&#039;t do it cause they know they will only prove it to be comparable to a placebo.<br /><br />Health insurance companies are businesses out for profit they will fund anything that gets them clients and only pay out so long as it suits them. By offering X sessions with a chiropractic they get more customers and make money off them.<br /><br />This is helping migraine and cluster headache suffers. Like I explained cluster headaches (and to a lesser extent migraine) suffers are sometimes driven to the point of suicide they are desperate and will fork out money for anything, they are in an extremely vulnerable position and several people in this thread are aiding and abetting quack chiropractics scamming them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said my piece, I&#039;ll leave this thread as I don&#039;t want to annoy OP, but I wont apologise for trying to protect vulnerable people.

				Have you tried Sumatriptan? I know a few migraine sufferers and it&#039;s been really effective for them. When the migraine starts, you take one, and it goes away.
