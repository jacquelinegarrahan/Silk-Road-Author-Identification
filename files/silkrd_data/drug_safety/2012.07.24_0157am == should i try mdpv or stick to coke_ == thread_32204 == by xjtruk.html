				i&#039;m an occasional coke user (&lt; 1/month) and i don&#039;t binge all night or anything.&nbsp; however, i have in the past :P<br /><br />i know myself, even tho i don&#039;t use often i think about coke more often than i like to admit.&nbsp; i&#039;m curious about mdpv and i like the price - sooo cheap!&nbsp; but of course i&#039;ve heard all this crazy shit, not sure if it&#039;s right for me.

				It sounds like you&#039;re interested in trying out new things. What do you intend to achieve each time you do drugs? Do you want to get fucked up? Get a different perspective on life? Be happy? Energized? Relaxed?<br /><br />Nailing down what you want from drugs will certainly help you in your search for new things to try. Personally I don&#039;t touch anything that has the possibility of becoming physically addicting (not psychologically) like cocaine, meth, or heroine. I enjoy substances that give me no dependence and am able to function normally without. Like LSD or MDMA. <br /><br />You should try 2C-B if you haven&#039;t though. It&#039;s pretty cheap and you can insuffulate it if you want. Mahakala sells capsules of it for cheap. One capsule of 20mg is a solid dose.

				It&#039;s not as good as coke but worth a try. It&#039;s not as dangerous as people say, trust me. Just don&#039;t go on a 3 day binge like I did and you&#039;ll be fine.

				anything can be addictive. moderation on everything. personality ties deep with addiction.<br /><br />i will say, that i have had e pretty extensive grasp and use from a lot of&nbsp; drugs, and touched some that would be almost impossible to acquire here, thanks to SR. (except for heroin, anything being used via intravenous, high potency rc&#039;s like d.o.b and lesser known/used ones...and ct7) <br /><br />it all comes down to personality, your will power and overall responsibility-ness(haha)<br /><br />always, research, always monitor ur reaction/dosage/frequency, make sure u dont become a creep/sketch ball(hiding away from friends and family) rule of thumb is: let people know or partake so its exposed and you wont start shady activities and always work out and eat good!&nbsp; balance all that! and what do you get? the joys and splendors of curiosity and the body on drugs, here and there...go get ripped broo

				What I meant is physically addicting. I don&#039;t need my body crying out for more drugs, or being in pain until I take them. <br /><br />If I become psychologically addicted...well shit.

				Do yourself a favor and don&#039;t try mdpv.&nbsp; I split 500mg with 7 people and we all had a 3 day hangover (nothing terrible, but we could definitely tell our heads weren&#039;t right).&nbsp; It was a fucking blast while we were on it though...after about 14 hrs me and two buddies carried an ENTIRE FUCKING TREE through really fast moving water at a dam.&nbsp; This road crew was just getting to work at 7am to work on a bridge and was staring at us like we were crazy.&nbsp; Oh and we wrote a song that turned out to be horrible.&nbsp; We were all a little embarrassed about that one...whenever anyone brings it up we always act like it never happened...MDPV is some dirty stuff.<br /><br />We bought it at a convenience store under the brand name &quot;locomotion&quot;...pretty accurate lol<br /><br />Or if you do do it, start really small and DON&#039;T re-dose

				We started around 6pm, and took the final bit around 1 or 2 am.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t sleep that night or the next night, but i got a crappy nights sleep the night after that.&nbsp; <br /><br />We thought the initial dose way best described as a REALLY speedy ecstasy roll.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done meth, but we all came to the conclusion that it was like coke that lasted way longer, with a really nice euphoric molly like buzz.&nbsp; Ego loss was definitely there after a couple re-doses, and we were all able to play hand drums a lot better than we had before (at least we thought at the time lol).&nbsp; We jammed for hours...Definitely an interesting drug, but I will never do it again.&nbsp; That should tell you how bad the comedown was...i could go on an on about how much fun I had while on it, but I will NEVER touch that shit again. <br /><br />It should be noted that I do not have a high tolerance for stimulants.&nbsp; I do coke &lt;1 month, don&#039;t drink coffee, and take adderall to study (if I take a 30XR at 9am, I will have trouble sleeping that night).&nbsp; But 6 other people had similar effects...
