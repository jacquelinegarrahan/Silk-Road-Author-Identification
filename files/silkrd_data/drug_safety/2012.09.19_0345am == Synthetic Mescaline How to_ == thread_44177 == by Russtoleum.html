				I know very little about synthetic mescaline and i have tried a search on these boards and erowid but i new my quickest most straight forward answer would come from here. I simply want to know if synthetic mescaline can be absorbed nasally?

				The sheer amount of mescaline you would need...just makes me shiver a little bit. I&#039;m sure it is possible, but at what cost? Torn up, sore nose for the rest of your trip? Maybe I&#039;m a baby, but after snorting DMT once I have learned some substances just shouldn&#039;t go up your nose.

				i would never do this. the oral and intranasal bioavailabilities are about the same. have you ever snorted 2c-e? 10mg of 2c-e is enough to make a grown man cry in agony. 2c-e is chemically very similar to mescaline, so the mescaline salt is likely to be just as painful. you need at least 500mg of mescaline for a trip equivalent to what 10mg of 2c-e would give you. it is possible that converting the mescaline salt to freebase would make it less painful, but mescaline freebase is less bioavailable than mescaline salt so you would be wasting product. it would be more economic and much easier to simply parachute the powder, or put it in a gel capsule and swallow.<br /><br />sawyer

				i wasnt able to find any examples of people snorting mescaline online, and mescaline is an extremely popular chemical. there has to be a reason why nobody&#039;s snorting it :P

				I have recently procured 2g of Mescaline HCL through this site and have never used ever before so wouldn&#039;t mind some info on the matter.<br /><br />So if snorting is out, what is done with it? I guess 300mg in a bomber?<br /><br />And what is to be expected?<br /><br />Is it gonna make me wanna puke?

				the most common method is to dissolve your mescaline salts in water. the absorption will be slightly slower than parachuting (wrapping the powder in tissue paper and swallowing) but is much less likely to cause stomach discomfort. nausea typically only occurs with peyote or san pedro and is not due to the mescaline, but rather due to the cellulose in the pulp and perhaps some of the more ubiquitous alkaloids. pure mescaline should go down smooth. i recommend taking sodium bicarbonate 45 minutes prior to administration of the mescaline. tums work fine

				I don&#039;t understand why some people are so fixated on insufflilation. Is it to look cool or something? It&#039;s a miserable way to take drugs and only a handful actually have increased bio availabilities when done this way.

				completely agree flicky. i used to have a friend that insisted on taking his amphetamines intranasally, which i always felt was really painful and actually kind of dirty. crushing up the pills just introduces the opportunity for dirt and dust to get into the mix. not to mention the experience doesn&#039;t last as long. and insufflation causes long-term damage to your nasal cavity, which you use just about every second of your life. humans evolved alongside intoxicating alkaloids, but they were nearly always consumed orally or, in some cases, smoked. the stomach is well equipped to deal with the harmful effects of particulate matter, but the nose is not. think about it - you wouldn&#039;t sniff 500 milligrams of some random ground up salt you found on the table, so why would mescaline salts be any different? just because it has psychoactive effects, doesn&#039;t make it better for your nasal lining.

				I should have been more specific. I have no desire to snort this, i just didn&#039;t think taking it orally would work. Which i guess is dumb to assume that just because DMT isn&#039;t orally ingestible doesn&#039;t mean everything is. Thanks for the info.

				the similarity in molecular structure is not necessarily a way of determining its effective bioavailabilities. for example, dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is not active orally, but diethyltryptamine (DET) is. the same is true about dosage, as clearly evidenced by the fact that some tryptamines are active in the microgram range, while others require up to a gram! the reasons for this are poorly understood scientifically speaking, so i truly have no idea why this is so. however, i can assure you that mescaline is active orally. it is probably active sublingually and buccally as well, so if you are concerned about not receiving the full effect, you could put some powder under your tongue for good measure. it probably tastes BAD though. i recommend gel capping it (:<br /><br />sawyer

				I&#039;ve done it.&nbsp; It burns slightly, but isn&#039;t any worse than Ketamine.<br />Ingested 400mg orally, then bumped a few lines 20 minutes after that to help get things going.<br />The stuff tastes horrible, and it tastes horrible when it drips down the back of your throat after snorting, so really there is no benefit.<br />Intranasal ingestion can hit you faster with many drugs, and mescaline is very forgiving with its tolerance, allowing you to redose several times during your trip, or even the next day.&nbsp; I bumped really close to my initial ingestion to stack the initial dose, and then towards the end of my trip to boost the length of it.<br />I&#039;d say it helped a bit with the trip, but as others have pointed out, using it as your primary method of ingestion would be &quot;whack&quot; as you&#039;d have to snort so much powder, it&#039;d just be dripping all down your throat anyhow.

				Also,&nbsp; http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mescaline/mescaline_chemistry1.shtml<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s start with the basics: mescaline (freebase) = C11H17NO3. C 11 * 12.011 H 17 * 1.008 N 1 * 14.007 O 3 * 15.999 ------- total 211.261 grams per mol mesc This would be mesc as the freebase; an oil at STP. As the stable, solid forms, there are two common ones: the hydrochloride (HCl) salt and the sulfate (H2SO4) salt. It possible that someone has made, say, mesc acetate, but it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve ever seen. They&#039;re on their own. With the hydrochloride, a single mesc molecule is paired with one HCl molecule to form the salt. so, some more masses: Mescaline Hydrochloride: mesc 1 * 211.261 H 1 * 1.008 Cl 1 * 35.453 ------- 247.722 grams per mole mesc.HCl Sulfate: In the sulfate, there are two mescalines per H2SO4. To complicate things slightly, the sulfate exists as the dihydrate, meaning there are also two H20s per unit cell. You end up with: (mesc)2.H2SO4.(H2O)2 mesc 2 * 211.261 H 6 * 1.008 S 1 * 32.068 O 6 * 15.999 ------- 556.632 grams per mole of (mesc)2.H2SO4.(H2O)2 But you want that in terms of one, not two, mesc molecules. So divide by two: 278.316 grams per mole mesc sulfate [mesc.(H2SO4)1/2.H2O] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion factors based on the above, for equivalent amounts of mescaline: 100 mg mesc sulfate = 89.0 mg mesc hydrochloride = 75.9 mg mesc freebase So, with the two salt forms, there&#039;s only about an 11% difference. If someone gets confused between one and the other, the mix-up is not going to cause major havoc.

				Mesc is a wonderful trip.&nbsp; I have done it several times orally in a gel cap. where there is about 250 mg of mesc and a small amount of niacin in them.&nbsp; From what I have heard from who I get them from this small amount of niacin helps open your blood vessels which in turn helps distribute the drug through your system.&nbsp; Any thoughts on this would be nice.<br /><br />I also wouldn&#039;t advise doing mesc when drinking alcohol.&nbsp; Seems like everyone I know that does this (even a single beer) and it makes you sick for the first parts of the trip. <br /><br />Wanted to put my few cents in.
