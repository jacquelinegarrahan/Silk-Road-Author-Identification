				through most of my life smoking weed would make me overthink a lot and in most cases, whenever I listened to some nice trance (armin van buuren, tiesto, deadmau5, etc..) I would effortlessly be able to create stories in my head that I could detail with amazing clarity.. the first time it happened it lasted pretty long and had me eyes closed, lying in a seat for 30 minutes while my playlist played.. I never had any problems with that I&#039;ve always thought I&#039;m very creative.. <br /><br />as a kid I played with my hands until way later than everybody else.. I have many habits I&#039;ve never been able to take care of..<br /><br />After my first LSD trip (I did 300 mcg, tripped ultra super hard, complete loss of ego, report posted somewhere in forums) I noticed that when I get very high (many days of the week) I would sometimes feel like everybody was watching me and I&#039;d have minor flashbacky types of thoughts (about my trip) and whenever I was alone I would question the reality of everything, including my own sanity.. My pupils would get dilated (not completely though) whenever it happened.. I thought well weed is a minor hallucinogen and it didn&#039;t happen while sober.. until it did<br /><br />I was studying very late, had eaten and slept badly for a few days.. and when I went to bed I couldn&#039;t sleep because my brain started thinking a lot.. I tried to force myself to sleep but when I closed my eyes for some reason I started focusing on the color of my eyelids and couldn&#039;t stop.. eventually visuals started appearing, millions of turning geometrical shapes and weird objects in 2dimensions all raced upwards in front of me.. My pupils were dilated and I tripped with those shapes for around 30 minutes, then started tripping harder.. a whole world was created around me and I was paralyzed completely I could only move in that world<br /><br />When I woke up I thought it might have been lack of sleep or even a lucid dream (because that second part was actually pretty awesome)<br /><br />after that day though, I would question my reality more&nbsp; even when sober.. sometimes I felt people watching me at times, and had uncontrollable muscle spasms but all of this not hard to remove from my head, unless I was high<br /><br />a few days ago I tripped on a small dose of shrooms and helped many friends of mine who were having bad trips, after that day it hasn&#039;t happened again sober or not.. but today I read this thread: http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/17388779/page/1/fpart/1<br /><br />and I found myself with many of those symptoms, hence the question<br /><br />I know it is possible but what are possible red flags? besides the ones I had lol

				Maybe you trust a friend or family member enough to ask them if they are noticing something different or odd about you. They can maybe tell you a bit more, or keep an eye on you. If it is schizophrenia, you don&#039;t want to have this develop into it&#039;s full force. I know this is not what you want to hear, but it is probably for the best not to use any psychedelics for a good while, including weed.<br /><br />Take good care, mate.

				I don&#039;t read anything you describe as a sign of schizophrenia. It sounds like all paranoia to me, which could be caused by the combination of a bad trip experience alone, and worsened by a cannabis habit in your case.<br /><br />If you plan on continuing cannabis use, i&#039;d suggest going for strains that have relatively high CBD levels and those tend to produce more of a stoned then high sensation, possibly reducing the feelings of paranoid anxiety a bit.&nbsp; Alternatively you could try to treat the anxiety part of the problem by means of xanax and such. I doubt that will remove the paranoia though, but it is likely to make your reaction to it less severe. <br /><br />Another idea may be to revisit LSD, but this time in a lower dosage and comfortable environment. This would obviously be very experimental, but perhaps having a nice trip may somehow offset your previous negative experience and lift fear from experiencing that again. <br /><br />

				wise words above...<br /><br />IMHO you&#039;re cool and there&#039;s nothing to be concerned about at all.<br /><br />You have opened up the psyche and now you just need to go through a process of further integration.<br /><br />I suggest rest your brain for a while and I also suggest cutting down on your cannabis use. Daily habitual use can definitely support the state you are describing.<br /><br />I also agree that in time, a perhaps lower dose acid trip will support integration and re-balancing.<br /><br />Welcome!

				Just calm down and take a pause for some months or maybe years.<br />After weekly (weekends) consume of high doses of shrooms and LSD some years ago, i felt suddenly very paranoid, saw people in bushes and some other crazy shit.<br />But after 3-4 weeks it was absolutely gone. <br />Eat healthy, do&nbsp; regulary sports and you will soon be fine!

				Yeah, maybe HPPD. I figure if you&#039;re really schizophrenic you would not think you&#039;re schizophrenic.

I would bet that this is what you experienced.<br />Ace

				Man, I get closed eye visuals&nbsp; (&amp; often open eye visuals) all the time when I am caning weed. It takes like a week of total abstinence before it begins to fade.<br />Not sure if this has been brought on by my use of Ecstasy or LSD / shrooms in the past or if it is just a side effect of the weed.<br /><br />But when this trippyness is not there anymore I kind of miss it. Pure black when you close your eyes means that there is nothing to look at or focus on except your own thoughts.<br />When you are waiting in a long queue it is soothing to just stare at the floor and watch as it transforms into an undulating ocean!<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry man, they are just harmless patterns. Just visual manifestation of structure, sequences, series and natural mathematical phenomena. You subconscious somehow projects a dimension or aspect of these electrical and structural workings onto the visual processing part of your brain.<br /><br />I don&#039;t cane drugs like I used to and seem to have reached a point where it does not get any worse and in fact gets better when I lay off the weed for a few days to a week.<br />But I like weed too much to do much laying off, lol.<br />Even small amounts of weed will give me the visuals when going to bed, but will wear off by the next day so that I can actually concentrated on work instead of the shimmering carpets and doors:)

				I&#039;ve found that I have residual hallucinogenic effects for a day or two after a heavy acid trip, though I don&#039;t get that paranoia but you may be worrying too much about some benign effects.<br /><br />Still, psychedelics CAN trigger underlying latent mental conditions and if this persists for a while then you might want to look into it deeper.&nbsp; I&#039;d opt to stay positive though, HPPD (real hppd, most people think they have it but its just mild static or sleep deprivation causing hallucinations more often than not), I doubt you have HPPD or schiz.&nbsp; Just focus on the idea that everything will be okay.&nbsp; That way you&#039;ll stop thinking about things that probably aren&#039;t there, but if they persist then you can start thinking about what to do next.

				Look man, relax. Take a bit of time away. When I was about 15 I bought a hit of cid from my friends older brother. Me and about 15 of my friends took it... I had a little less than an 8ball of coke too. <br /><br />So, we drop the hit. After about an hour we&#039;re like &quot;yeah this is bullshit.&quot; <br /><br />It actually wasn&#039;t and it fucked me up long and hard. Oh yeah, plus we started doing the cocaine like immediately. <br /><br />Imagine manic state much? Schizophrenia? Voices? <br /><br />I was seriously fucked for weeks. It was a terrible night. Up and down - up and down. Always tripping. <br /><br />Morning time came and my dad picked me up from my friends, thought it would be a good time to take me and my sister to the local parking lot to teach us how to drive. OMG. <br /><br />Then when I got home my brother wanted to play video games. <br /><br />I remember hearing voices in my head, and just being completely out of it, tired, strung out, and hadn&#039;t slept from the cidney. <br /><br />I was washing my hair and musta been 5 min while I listened to the voices in my head. I thought I was seriously fucked...enter: &quot;am I schizophrenic?&quot; <br /><br />Tripping again after that was always giving me anxiety. <br /><br />Nowadays I seem to have ok or nice trips, but what I personally like to do when I am planning on getting blasted is the following : have a bit of opiate/benzo/weed on hand. <br /><br />So if I trip out HARD as fuck. I take the opiate/benzo/weed combo (usually like 10mg hydro, .25 xanax or kpin and however much chronic) as I come down, this knocks me right the fuck out. <br /><br />I wake up the next morning feeling refreshed and sort of not remembering anything as reality, it was all just a crazy ass dream to me. <br /><br />In turn, I find I am better able to digest the experience and analyze it...it&#039;s like the wave comes, crashes, I drown, and then whenever I am brought back to life I make myself go to sleep via the method described...then I wake up 8 - 12 hours later highly refreshed and able to ponder the experience. <br /><br />Hope this helps mate. <br /><br />Also, if you try to convince yourself that you are fucked in the head, likely you&#039;ll just keep doing that. Thought loops don&#039;t only exist in the psychedelic world. They just seem more palpable and observable.

				hey all of you thanks a lot for your replies<br /><br />I had been living outside of my country for a few months and I went back for break and took a break from drugs (except alcohol)<br /><br />the night before I left i took 1/2 a tab and it helped me so much.. It really set the tone for a great break. I thought everything through and definitely hppd that I still feel sometimes but I can focus out of it because I realized now that I was also suffering from bad, bad, bad depression.. I didn&#039;t shower for weeks I slept over 18 hours and then I didn&#039;t sleep for over 40 more.. I never knew which day of the week it was.. I wasn&#039;t doing anything, I didn&#039;t shower for days I didn&#039;t shave for weeks and all of this happened while I thought everything was as normal and good as always.<br /><br />over break I realized what happened to me and started using the effects lsd left me with to refocus my life to a much more positive direction<br /><br />thanks for all your tips I really found them helpful
