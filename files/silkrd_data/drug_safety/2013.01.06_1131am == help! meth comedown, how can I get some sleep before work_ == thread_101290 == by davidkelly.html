				I&#039;m not a big fan of speed, I do it once in a blue moon when I&#039;m offered some, so I have no tolerance. And I will usually only do it if I have some pks or benzos for the comedown cause speed hits me really really hard, it lasts a long ass time and I crash really hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway my friend came over last night around 9pm to chill, he had some meth and asked if I wanted to smoke with him. Like a retard I said yes&nbsp; :-[ and we smoked meth and then we smoked one more time around 12am. Well here it is 6am now and I&#039;m still high as fuck =/ I don&#039;t even think i&#039;v started to crash yet cause I still feel pretty good, so I&#039;m sure I will be up all day today. But I&#039;m worried im not gonna be able to sleep at all before work, I&nbsp; work at 5am tomorrow, so im gonna try to fall asleep around 7pm tonight.<br /><br />And just my luck I don&#039;t have any benzos, opiates or weed even. I&#039;m almost broke right now 2, so I don&#039;t have money to score today.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do to ease the crash and fall asleep tonight? Anything, any over the counter shit that would help? Cause I&#039;m gonna be feeling like complete and utter shit in a couple hours.....not looking forward 2 it =/ <br /><br />really wish I had some xanax or pks today lol

				Relaaax man. Worst thing you can do is worry about not sleeping, and then spend hours &#039;trying&#039; to sleep.<br /><br />Even lying down in a dark room, breathing calmly and just being there awake will rejuvenate your system by morning. Tell yourself you don&#039;t have to sleep, and if you do it&#039;s a bonus - only achieved by dropping the urgency.<br /><br />Next time say no, or get your mate to leave you a bit extra for the next day&nbsp; :D

Much better than arousing any negative attention to yourself and a must if you work in any field where someone could get hurt due to your actions.

				I always crash the natural way, but it was hard and very painful when I didn&#039;t have a tolerance... I ended up just feeling like my neurons were fried and wouldn&#039;t fire to save my life.&nbsp; Everything would be boring, bland, uninteresting... I&#039;d feel exhausted and the only thing I&#039;d want to do is sleep, but I wouldn&#039;t be able to.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard people say getting drunk makes it easier.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t know; I stopped drinking right about the time I started taking amphetamines.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve heard others say that.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in America, you can try a sleep aid from the supermarket.&nbsp; Try Unisom or anything else that has diphenhydramine.&nbsp; It&#039;s a powerful depressant, it should knock you down -- but don&#039;t take too much!&nbsp; Don&#039;t get yourself feeling even worse because you take too much of something else now.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;d try combining a dose of melatonin with a dose of unisom an hour or two before I wanted to get some sleep.&nbsp; See if that works for you.
