				So I&#039;ve never been much into cocaine, but I do like methylone and mephedrone (4-MMC).<br />I recently got a bullet and LOVE that damn thing for snuff. <br />But I wanna use the bullet for some more euphoric but subtle substance. I was thinking maybe 4-MEC?<br />Basically I wanna be able to sit around bumping every 20-30 min or so while relaxing. Ketamine is a candidate and is on the way :)<br /><br />Does anyone have suggestions for a good brand of snuff or a fun, but chill (most likely stimulant) drug that I can put in a bullet and enjoy the afternoon?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />&nbsp;8) ;D

				Great was just making sure regarding the Ket, so make a mix and fly, its great!<br /><br />4MEC - very similar to all the other X-MXX ,&nbsp; &nbsp;i just done now a few lines when i was sober to see and was a bit less potent than the meph but cleaner and easier.<br />(usually i take that during meph sessions so its a bit hard to tell - even now as we speak)<br /><br />3-MMC also nice,&nbsp; to say the truth, i can really tell with all these names and numbers which was which and which one was better - i just love the whole cathinones family! even the fresh Khat leafs :)<br /><br />as i mentioned in other threads:<br />- if its got the cathinone smell<br />- if its getting me high as a kite<br />- if it doesn&#039;t cause weird side effects<br />i love it!

				Thanks - these qualifications&nbsp; served me pretty well over the years, cause lets be honest, with all the cathinones floating around for the last 10 years no one really knows what hes getting or even vendors don&#039;t even know what they are selling. so as long it does what you expect it to do, than all good :)<br /><br />regarding Khat - its totally legal in my country and VERY common and super cheap (everyone growing it), i use it quite a lot.&nbsp; i did not try coca leafs but from what i understand from friends who did try, its not exactly same -&nbsp; you can say khat its similar to the mephedrone effect but waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy more weaker - like take the same effect but only 5% of the strength.&nbsp; you also need strong jaws if you wan to get high real good :)<br /><br /><br />and ketadron -&nbsp; basically yes, mix them both, calculate the timing so you will have the peak of the meph and the k-hole at same time,&nbsp; great ride!&nbsp; :))<br />i would do that now if i had any more ketamine, all i had got seized by fucking LE a few months ago.<br /><br />- also today and even as i write this, i have been mixing wertus rocks with 4MEC (mix both powders together)&nbsp; - and found that also as a very good combination! from some reason it makes everything easier and much less fiendish (although im binging for over 24 already, so....) and just feels less dirty in general.<br /><br />

				Hello!<br /><br />I am here, reporting back with my results so far with the 3-MMC/Ketamine mixture.<br />To be honest, I&#039;m not terribly impressed with the 3-MMC. I have yet to *really* feel effects from it. Maybe the doses are too small? I have gotten moderately high from some of it, so I know it&#039;s legit. <br /><br />ANYWAYS.<br /><br />I made a mix of about 60/40 3-MMC to Ket ratio and that seems to be rather fun, but requires lines in order to be recreational alone. Accompanies other activities well (such as reading, hanging out at home, chilling on the beach, etc). The tolerance thing is an issue though. I do dislike using drugs to no effect, so I guess I&#039;ll just have to put these on the shelf for a bit. :P<br /><br />

				Zip could you recommend me a cheap stimulant/euphoria/feel good drug that is cheap and affordable? I can&#039;t spend too much at the moment and the best I can afford right now with the remaining btc on my account is 0.5g of ketamine.. I have had experience with it and i&#039;m not sure if it will last long. <br /><br />Any other chems you can recommend? Basically I just want something I can bump every 20-30 mins like you said as well.. but I&#039;d like to make sure to be able to get some sleep at night lol

				Given the many variables; dosage, setting, quality, experience and so on, it seems hard to generalize one persons fun drug to anothers.&nbsp; A little like what is your favorite movie?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to see &quot;what is your favorite drug&quot; on a security question though?&nbsp; My pat answer is whatever I have in my hands at the time I&#039;m thinking about mind alteration.&nbsp; Which raises the category question of primarily a body type high or rush and the drugs that zone out the mind.&nbsp; Indica vs sativa for example. <br /><br />I&#039;m much more interested in the body sensations than the mental part but the that&#039;s just what I&#039;m used to.&nbsp; Given the amount of trouble I have controlling this bad habit I&#039;m very reluctant to branch out to other areas.&nbsp; We need more scientific experimentation and I&#039;m ready if they need volunteers to study these effects under controlled settings.<br /><br />Great question,<br /><br /><br />Mr Clean

Not trying to be a dick just genuinely curious?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve gone a month straight on 15-30 mg a day, then stopped.&nbsp; Withdrawals lasted 6 days.&nbsp; It&#039;s not terrible, even though it is, so long as you commit to the thought of it only lasting a few days... lol<br /><br />And yes, if you start off with 7.5 as a baseline, that&#039;s all you will need.&nbsp; Anything less than a 1/4 of a 30, and you should eat it; cause you&#039;ll waste a bit on the way up.&nbsp; You always went right to 15 MG?&nbsp; 15 and 7.5 don&#039;t even feel that much dif to me in one shot, but I get way more out of the pill if I hit it 4 times, as opposed to 2.&nbsp; You know?&nbsp; <br /><br />One time, some guy at a get-together was like &quot;Anyone wanna buy a Blue&quot; and so I naturally was like, &quot;Ooo yeah me!&quot; and we went into this guest bedroom to crush em up in private, etc.&nbsp; This other dude who bought one was trying to show him some super complicated &#039;fold up&#039; method of making a &quot;tray&quot; out of the bill or something for &quot;easy snorting&quot; and my cocky drug addict side came out, and I was like &quot;That&#039;s not necessary, watch this.&quot;&nbsp; And put the entire 30 into a bill, rolled, smacked it w/ a lighter pinched both ends down and &#039;rolled&#039; the lighter over the bill real hard 3 times, then put it up to my face and snooted.&nbsp; The entire process only takes me like 10 seconds, rolling the bill taking the most time.&nbsp; He was impressed and much less confused by my method of &quot;on the go&quot; bumping... but I failed to break up my 30... <br /><br />I had a few liquor drinks in me, and no tolerance.&nbsp; I was fucking blasted.&nbsp; I think I bought another 30 and did half of that like 2 hours later, and felt absolutely horrible an hour or 2 after that.&nbsp; <br /><br />lol -&nbsp; but yeah.&nbsp; 7.5 works well for me.

It&#039;s definitely more mellow but more functional as well. I could enjoy this at a party and no one would know that I was on it as long as I wasn&#039;t sniffling too much. Comedown is also very mellow and relaxed, very much unlike a cocaine comedown. 4-MMC has this incredibly powerful and pushy euphoria which is nice, but isn&#039;t as functional as 3-MMC, which is more in the middle and allows for better concentration on a task like sex or reading a book or chatting around at a party :) <br /><br />If one was going for full-blown euphoria I&#039;d say to go with MDMA or 4-MMC, for sure. But 3-MMC is my go-to for casual feelgood afternoons.

				Here are my final thoughts:<br /><br />3-MMC mixed with S-Isomer Ketamine is great, as long as it&#039;s done in lines.<br />When done in lines, it produces the most relaxed, floaty, amazing warm feeling EVER. It&#039;s like MDMA, I swear. The more lines you do, the closer to MDMA world you get.<br /><br />3-MMC is good alone, but requires lines (one or two) to really come out and do anything noticeable. <br /><br />Bumps of ketamine are good when used moderately (produces the stimmy vs psychedelic effect). If used too often, a bump doesn&#039;t really do anything and you just waste good k.<br /><br />But wow, I feel AMAZING right now. <br />Mixed MarcelKetman&#039;s Ketamine with uhrwerk&#039;s 3-MMC at about a 1:1 ratio and I am so surprised at how amazing I feel right now. My chest is practically glowing with the warmth of openness and empathy. Lots of sighs. :)<br /><br />It just feels so damn good. I am melting into a slow puddle of amazing. <br />Thanks Ballzy and Microdotter for contributing to this stellar combination. <br />I am lounging, listening to jazz, and feeling that good gooood.<br /><br />Much love.
