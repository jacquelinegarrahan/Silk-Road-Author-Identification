				*NOTE: I am sharing my experience of I.V. BTH in the interests of harm reduction. It is not meant as express negative feedback regarding towards a&nbsp; particular vendor whom I have great admiration and respect for. *<br /><br />I scored a bottle of Hatter&#039;s &#039;cold- shot&#039; black tar Heroin over a week ago. BTH is extremely rare to come across here in Canada... in fact, I only came across it once in my 20 years of using.When I got into smack 20 years ago all you could get was China White from the Golden Triangle usually from Vietnamese gang dealers. That shit was strong.. but ever since the U.S. took out the Taliban the market is flooded with #4 Afghan..and it seems a lot more cut.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways,getting a super stealthy package from Hatter was really exciting: getting purified heroin in a medical like little bottle was a throwback to the days when you could buy it as a cough suppressant. It is a super convenient format for the junky on the go: no cooking, no filtering...just fill the rig and fix. Hatter is a super knowledgeable guy and was extremely helpful . Despite being short of Btc&#039;s he was kind enough to send me the product.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, I have a high opiate tolerance so I filled up a new Icc rig tied up my right arm, swabbed it with alcohol, and fixed in my &#039;sweet spot&#039; on my inner elbow forearm. This injection was the most&nbsp; PAINFUL thing I have ever subjected myself too. It BURNED like a mofo during the whole short process. I am certain that I didn&#039;t miss but unfortunately after the injection besides merely getting mildly narcotic &#039;warm blanket&#039; feeling the area surrounding the injection site turned red and puffy and became very sensitive to touch.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Needless to say I didn&#039;t I.V. the rest: I ended up doing the remaining BTH I.M. over the course of the last week and as I was being very cautious: only increasing the subsequent doses by 10 ml each time. In retrospect, I wish I had just done 200 ml I.M. shots from the get go... which irregardless of a high tolerance seems to be a lot considering that this was purified heroin. To be honest, I was expecting thus stuff to be a lot stronger... I recall buying some Afghan #4 from Noriega before he went rogue and a 20 mg intranasal line put me on the nod for a good hour.<br /><br />Anyways, my arm is still a little sore..the area a little inflamed, and the circulation seems slightly&nbsp; impaired but&nbsp; is slowly improving. Nevertheless, it did give&nbsp; me bit of a scare for the first few days when I felt a &#039;pins and needles&#039; sensation in that arm. Needless to say, I will never use that arm again for I.V.: I think that years of shooting H,coke, and pills (dillies and morphine) have taken it&#039;s toll and it would be stupid to continue pushing my luck. Although my experience with BTH is very limited (and I am not a trained medical expert) I suspect that the I.V. shot may&nbsp; have possibly &#039;leaked&#039; from an old scarred or damaged injection site and may have upset the PH balance of surrounding tissue. <br /><br />I know most junkie&#039;s have a sworn oath of loyalty to I.V. use, but IMO, I think that it&#039;s overrated and generally not worth the associated health risks. I find that although I.M. is not as immediate and requires a bit larger dose it is a ROI that i think is personally far safer (esp. when you are alone) and less likely to be cause medical complications.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />However, in the future, I think I&#039;ll just stick to #4 powder which I can either snort or shoot far easier than BTH.<br /><br />I encourage any SR users who have had similar experiences or have relevant observations/ thoughts to post them here in the interests of harm reduction.

				Yes I would be very careful about which batches of Heroin I shoot. <br /><br />Personally I think its a good practice to snort a small amount whenever you receive a new batch just so you know what to expect.<br /><br />Also thanks for the 20mg line hour long nod note. I am new to heroin personally so having a vague idea of dosages definitely helps. I was thinking of snorting approximately half a .1 for my first time however after reading this I&#039;d probably tone it down to about 10 mgs to be safe.<br /><br />Doing a 10mg line of oxy will have my nodding and floating so on heroin it should be the same.<br /><br />Thanks for the interesting and informative post.

				BTH is extremely acidic, that&#039;s why it colapses your veins so fast. I can tell you first hand, missing a vein with BTH burns and causes a hystamine reaction and will give you a temporary rash. If not an abcess. I haven&#039;t used it in a while but I don&#039;t remeber it burning that bad when entering a vein, although it almost always gave me a little bump and red spot.<br />This was the product that was filtered and bottled in solution right? I always thought Heroin brokedown slowly into Morphine when disolved in water. Maybe this isn&#039;t an ideal storage method for Heroin?

				lol, i just found it hilarious to think about you trying to push 200 freaking ml into your muscle! that would be so painful and a sight to see. did you mean 2 ml? <br /><br />are you sure you didnt miss, like potentially after registering accidentally slipping out or poking through the other side, or wall of the vein? just ask because it doesnt sound like a normal reaction. should have been fairly clean with the purification though<br /><br />also if you can nod off 10 mg of oxy, you should just stick to oxy and hydrocodone. then once youre addicted to opiates because of them but cant afford the doses anymore you start doing H. good dope is way more potent than oxy

				forgot to mention generally i think IM tar is considered a huge safety risk. even filtered, because of the lack of circulation and ability for the immune cells to infiltrate, abscesses can form in the muscles much more easily.&nbsp; these have the potential to cause serious limb damage or even worse go septic which can often be fatal. this is one situation where IV is actually safer in a way

				Hi,<br /><br />Sorry to hear that you had such a reaction but the filtered H is done with bacterostatic water .9% benzyl alcohol then another drop of 95% etoh is added for good measure to kill any bacteria, so it sounds like a histamine reaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I would never suggest an IM of the BTH because of the histamine reactions and even the etoh can cause a reaction, in this case IV is the safe route and the sterile water and etoh in the solution is there to act as a preservative and minimize cellulitis and infections if the shot is &quot;missed&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Cold Shoot IV #4 H is just for that, IV, not IM or &quot;skin pops&quot; as it is really acidic and prone to collapse a vein if done incorrectly, I would even suggest that more liquid can be added to the solution.&nbsp; Just distilled water works.&nbsp; Even for myself I use a 50mg/ml solution for BTH, I have only offered it at this strength as I knew that most people would not be as happy with a 50mg/ml and hope that everyone uses wisely.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; <br />

				Another good thing to disolve your Heroin in is &#039;Arm &amp; Hammer&#039; Simply Saline Nasal Spray. You can find it in any pharmacy and it stays sterile throught the bottles use. It contains nothing but sterile saline solution.

				+1 for saline water......never use tap water saline water is cheap and you can get it at any pharmacy. Its sterile and will save your veins in the long run.

Again: this is an example of how decent and knowledgeable Hatter is. Unlike some of the more immature vendors who would see my post as a threat/insult and react with gun&#039;s a blazing he offers some sound harm reduction advice. He is a man of science and a real gentleman too. Thanks again Hatter.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t tried his Hatter&#039;s opiates I highly recommend them. They are the &#039;Holy Grail&#039; as far as opiates go.<br />These are very rare items: so if you have the cash try them out.&nbsp; Peace.&nbsp; 8)

I think I missed went through it... or something b/c it shouldn&#039;t have hurt like it did. Tweaking on Meth doesn&#039;t exactly make for good target practice.Like I said: won&#039;t be using that arm again anytime soon. Looking forward to some H from NoGenRX soon... and hearing good things.. so looking forward to that. I&#039;ll keep ya posted. Later my Droogies.&nbsp; 8)
