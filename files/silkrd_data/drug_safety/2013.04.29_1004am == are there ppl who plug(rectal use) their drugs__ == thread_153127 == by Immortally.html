				Some drugs you can plug and you need less but intense high,ok i admit sound not tasteful but it,s 3x stronger than snorting or oral&nbsp; ;) <br />I read some info about this subject and if you know a efficient method it,s easy.

				When I was in my teenager years and I heard about it I laughted my ass off.<br />However I started researching the 2c-X compounds and plugging seemed to be the best method of administration for this drugs. Much less side effects and best bioavailability.<br />So from then on I&#039;ve only plugged 2c-x compounds, no other drugs though. It might feel awkward at the beginning by sticking an oral syringe in ur but but what the hell, if it&#039;s better :D<br />just don&#039;t do it when there&#039;s other people around :p

				There are a lot of MDMA users that like plugging.&nbsp; Probably a low percentage now since everyone and their grandmother is using MDMA but there are definitely some benefits to plugging MDMA.&nbsp; Or doing an enema by dissolving it in water first which might be more comfortable.

				Was gonna plug K cause god fucking damnit that taste, also my sinuses are fucked and I can&#039;t snort anything. The dose it required was way too fucking high, so nothing up my k-hole.<br /><br />What&#039;re some stuff that&#039;s particularly good to plug?<br /><br />I&#039;ve even been thinking about butt-chugging as that would seem interesting at the very least.

				Like I said, 2c-X compounds. They&#039;re RC&#039;s so maybe thats nogo for some, but 2c-E/P/D/C... are all best absorbed by plugging. You always need only half the amount you need for oral administration. Moreover with oral administration a lot of people get nauseous, not with plugging though.&nbsp;

				I plug MDMA and MXE (if I don&#039;t have any syringes for IM/IV). I come up on MDMA in about 10-20 minutes and roll harder than oral. I come up in 5-10 minutes on MXE and get almost just as high as IM at the same dose but the rush is slightly weaker. (ears ringing, head buzzing, euphoria).

				depends on bioavailability through certain routes. <br /><br /><br />Buprenorphine for one has a very high IV bioavailability 100% I believe. but only 10% oral. Rectal somewhere in between.

				I just put some warm water into a 3mL syringe (without the needle obviously) while covering the hole for the needle.&nbsp; I add the MDMA to that and get the plunger back on without any of the water/MDMA coming out.&nbsp; Then I shake like mad.

				I never would have been able to bring myself to try this ROA if not for having MDMA in my system and being able to let go.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken MDMA orally in more recent times and now that I think about it there nausea might be worse with oral.<br /><br />One benefit to oral is that when people take a stupid amount of MDMA orally they&#039;ll at least throw it up (usually).<br /><br />I tried the gel cap thing.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t work so well for me.

				To all you pluggers out there, google &quot;lube launcher&quot; and thank me later ;)<br /><br />IMO There&#039;s no shame in plugging as long as you&#039;re doing it correctly, it can be a very efficient method of ingestion for certain substances, but, to each his own.<br />

				I only see the point in plugging certain drug most notably opiates that are highly effected through first past metabolism ie morphine, hyrdromorphone, possibly heroin. Its a safer alternative to IV and much more effective than other ROA&#039;s. I would imagine some of the 2cx series would be worthwhile since it would help alot with the nuasuea. IMO

				I&#039;m a straight white engaged male and i have plugged a small handfull of drugs. BTH being one of them. Only if smoking isn&#039;t an option like with seneca&#039;s dope. Also I will occasionally plug a roxi. Towards the end of my cathinone days, Plugging was the only option. I could not drink it in a glass of anything due to the taste, parachuting was just too big of a pill to swallow (literally) , and snorting was just too damaging. Plugging however; you could easily get half a gram or more absorbed with nearly 100% BA and a much more intense rush unreachable through any other ROA besides the needle. MDMA is good for plugging because plugging reduces nausea. Just be careful with your dose. I&#039;ve noticed you can get equal effects on half the dose rectally you would usually need orally.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.

				Honestly rectal is by far the best ROA for 2C-x&#039;s<br />It gives you the duration of oral, with the intensity of nasal<br />No mind bendingly painful burn<br />Half the onset time of Oral (no worries about eating prior too) - a little longer to double of nasal depending on the person<br />apparently bioavailibility is also highest <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably try mdma sometime.<br /><br />as for Ket I like the convenience of bumping even if the taste sucks.<br />
