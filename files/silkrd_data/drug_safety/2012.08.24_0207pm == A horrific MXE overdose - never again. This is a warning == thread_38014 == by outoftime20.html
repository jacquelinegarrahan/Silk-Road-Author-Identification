				One weekago today I suffered through the most horrific mxe overdose. I had about 900mg in a bag. I started with a couple xanax bars and some weed. Then I thought, lets try some mxe. So I did a normal amount and for some reason it didn&#039;t feel normal at all - Instead of feeling good my mind felt warped; insane. I was so clueless I decided to swallow the whole bag. From here, I sort of blacked out in a semi-conscious, torturous state of mind. I was suddenly suicidal. I kept smoking weed to feel better, even that didnt work. I flushed my system with water but it nothing would hydrate me, not matter how much I drank. My heart was beating so fast it felt like it was going to explode in my chest. I was convinced this is it - I thought about seeing a girl at my school who had recently committed suicide in the afterlife, and was tripping really really hard. I went in and out of consciousness all friday and saturday. Sunday was when the paranoia, anxiety and torture REALLY kicked in. I still wasnt down and felt insane. I begged my parents to take me to the hospital. I went into a panic attack and started convulsing and crying - If I remember correctly one of the assistants laughed when I said what I took. They drew blood and gave me some IV fluids. Finally I felt hydrated, but still high in a very bad way. They released me a few hours later and said I&#039;d recover. I believe I have because I&#039;ve had no lasting effects - but I&#039;llnever again fuck with research chemicals of any kind. Any drug use at all scares me and I have a sort of flashback - very terrifying. Tis was a life changing experience for the better. The only drug that doesnt send me into a panic attack now is opiates.

				You sound like a fucking idiot. No offense, but how do you manage to take 900 mg!?!?!?!?<br /><br />Did you research it at all? What in the sam hell was the idea of taking 9x the recommended dosage. Also, xanax is a bad idea at any peak/before trip experience. I took 3mg of xanax at the peak of a MDA trip/roll and only went into a fully delusional state.<br /><br />Don&#039;t mix drugs unless you are 100% sure what the combo will do to you. <br /><br />It is stupid behavior like this that causes us to get drugs banned.

				I know exactly how you feel. MXE is a weird drug. In my experience, people either love it or hate it. I hate it.<br /><br />MXE makes me stupid and question every aspect of my life in a negative way. And it makes me go to alien hell, which isn&#039;t very fun. I felt like I was dead while in an M-hole. I think part of it is that I have an anxious-type of personality, so I kind of freak out on MXE. Each time I tried it, all I wanted is for the trip to be over.<br /><br />Now ketamine? I love me some k!

Everything was grey and dull, especially with our London&#039;s weather it went like a perfect suicidal time.

I took 80 mg, never been so bored, whether on drugs or not. Short term memory fucked up, and the only few thoughts I had in 3 hours (?) were pretty negative, like suicidal thoughts and contemplating the supposed emptiness of life. And I wasn&#039;t depressed at the time or anything, it was just the MXE. Plus, on the comedown, it felt toxic in my body. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been recently experimenting with low doses (5-20), much better.&nbsp;

				MXE can be pretty dose sensitive, huh. (I recognize 900 mg is a massive overdose) I found myself in an mxe hole far more confusing than any k hole I&#039;ve had. That effect lasted 8 hours. This was all from an insufflated dose that filled up the recessed filter on a Parliament cigarette.

				Dissociation is about where the similarities end between Ketamine and Methoxetamine. MXE lasts four times as long, the drip is pretty heinous, and it&#039;s much more confusing. I&#039;ve found ketamine to be more euphoric and more drunken feeling, but also a bit moreish. It&#039;s hard to put down when it&#039;s around, but most dissociatives tend to be that way.

				I was thinking, 900mg would have sent you straight to ER in a coma.<br /><br />Are you sure you didn&#039;t end up in ER?<br /><br />People trip hard with less than 50mg of MXE (oral or nasal).<br /><br /><br />

				900mg is just down right insane and ignorant. FFS people research your doses and drugs... <br /><br />Here&#039;s my experience on around 150mg<br /><br />Entering the vibrational platue.<br /><br />I was bored one night and decided to try, what, in retrospect was a large to very large amount of MXE. I was hoping it would help me get to sleep. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This was my second time taking mxe. I really underestimated the purity and the power of this chemical.<br /><br />Around 9:30 I took around 100mg followed by another 50mg approximately, eyeballed. Possibly more. (Snuffulated)<br /><br />Given that this stuff takes a relatively long time to come up on I was unwise in redosing and have definitely learnt a valuable lesson and gained a strong<br />respect for this compound. Be patient, let it work. It will work.<br /><br />So it&#039;s coming on, everything has a very sci-fi feel to it, what&#039;s that buzzing? How could anyone sleep with all that buzzing. All the multicolored lights from the computer components in my room give me a very space age feeling. There&#039;s a cool, calm, weightlessness to everything, this is incredible. I have a great sense of well being and euphoria.<br />I feel as though I have a profound purpose on this planet, and everything that has happened to me in my life has happened for a reason, to shape me into the person I will become and am meant to be, I feel profound purpose.<br />Please know that I am Agnostic in my view of religion and spirituality but this experience has given me a hope that everything will be OK like I&#039;ve never had before.<br /><br />I spend about an hour drawing but keep coming up and up. Eventually I am unable to draw as the feeling is becoming very intense.<br />I have to close my eyes and ride it. I allow myself to be taken, I know that trying to fight it would be unwise.<br /><br />I keep coming up still more, I&#039;m beginning to get slightly afraid. I don&#039;t know if my eyes are open or shut. There is no contrast, the hallucinations are so real. I turn off my light, BOOM!<br />I&#039;m getting warped through all kinds of wonderful places and abstract realities. I remember getting to a place where I feel as though I am in contact with a god or gods, beings of pure light and energy and either dying or dead, this feeling is fleeting and comes and goes. The more I embrace it the more fearful I am I will not come back from it. I am cautious not to stay in this place for too long.<br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to describe all the places and incredible things. It was organized chaos, like a tsunami of objects, things, feelings and thoughts crashing in, on, and around<br />each other, churning to form an incredible storm of vivid imagery in the minds eye.<br />I spent a lot of time flying through the universe, visiting other plains of existence, odd dimensions, witnessing unfathomable things. I must of been a drooling mass in the corner of my bed in reality, but in my mind I was a journeyman, traveling through the unseen, plotting the unexplored parts of a rarely seen realm.<br /><br />At its most intense point I was able to break through like what seemed the roof of my existence where I was met by an energy or presence not unsimilar to the other beings, but more profound. It held no physical form, it was warm, pure loving energy.<br />I felt its calmness and sense of perfect being or existence. I asked it for help, now thinking that I had gone insane or retarded myself as I was unable to pull myself out of this place.<br />I felt I was schizophrenic in some sense of the word, I probably was.( I had been watching HBO OZ earlier that day and was having moments where I thought I had become Cyril O&#039;reilly)<br />The energy seemed to care about me, it embraced me,&nbsp; reminding me of my mothers hug. It didn&#039;t talk, but we understood each other.<br />It poured into me and gave me its love and a sense that everything was going to be alright.<br /><br />I kept reminding myself everything would be alright and that it would end. Eventually it did.<br /><br /><br />This happened over the course of 6-8 hours I theorize, but felt like much longer, more like lifetimes.<br />I don&#039;t remember ever checking what time it was. Time was not relevant in my strange lucid, drug induced, sleep deprived state.<br />I&#039;m sure trying to grasp the concept of time or even looking at a clock would of been completely lost on me.<br /><br />I awoke at 12am the next day. With a mild headache and slightly dilated pupils, both symptoms subsided soon after waking.<br /><br />Anyhow, I am glad to be back and have been left with a new sense of wonder in all things. I also appreciate life a lot more since I feel I came to the brink of destruction.<br />I was quite sure I was dying at points in the trip and was honestly really scared and curious all the same.<br /><br />Also please note walking was quite difficult if not almost impossible as I could feel every muscle expand and contract and they all seemed to want to work independently with a mind of there own. I may of pissed all over the bathroom floor.<br /><br />The fact that I turned the lights off and denied myself of outside stimulation I&#039;m sure added a hell of a lot to the feeling of losing my mind and overall intensity of everything.<br /><br />This is brief summary or the more indenting parts which I can recall. For my own well being and reflection. I hope others may gain something from it as well.<br /><br />Life is magic, flowing through us...

I had about 900mg in a bag. I started with a couple xanax bars and some weed. Then I thought, lets try some mxe. So I did a normal amount and for some reason it didn&#039;t feel normal at all - Instead of feeling good my mind felt warped; insane. I was so clueless I decided to swallow the whole bag. From here, I sort of blacked out in a semi-conscious, torturous state of mind. I was suddenly suicidal. I kept smoking weed to feel better, even that didnt work. I flushed my system with water but it nothing would hydrate me, not matter how much I drank. My heart was beating so fast it felt like it was going to explode in my chest. I was convinced this is it - I thought about seeing a girl at my school who had recently committed suicide in the afterlife, and was tripping really really hard. I went in and out of consciousness all friday and saturday. Sunday was when the paranoia, anxiety and torture REALLY kicked in. I still wasnt down and felt insane. I begged my parents to take me to the hospital. I went into a panic attack and started convulsing and crying - If I remember correctly one of the assistants laughed when I said what I took. They drew blood and gave me some IV fluids. Finally I felt hydrated, but still high in a very bad way. They released me a few hours later and said I&#039;d recover. I believe I have because I&#039;ve had no lasting effects - but I&#039;llnever again fuck with research chemicals of any kind. Any drug use at all scares me and I have a sort of flashback - very terrifying. Tis was a life changing experience for the better. The only drug that doesnt send me into a panic attack now is opiates.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Soooooo.....I&#039;ll be THAT guy!&nbsp; Hey OP, so in another thread you just posted you ask &quot;is it bad to do drugs all day everyday?&quot; <br />You say you sit around smoking weed all day and have no friends while your family shuns you. <br />Felt kinda bad for you as a fellow pot smoker.<br /><br />Then, I come and see this thread. Stay off the crazy mxe binges and opiates and shit might be ok. <br /><br />You pretty much answer your own question if you look hard enough.<br /><br />Peace

I walked through a workshop that was inside my head where memories were made/assembled BEFORE they happened and everyone in &quot;The Plant&quot; was expecting me as I walked inside......I realized time was Spherical and was told (patiently as I recall) that many people knew this and it was just my time to learn of these things.....<br /><br />I actually saw individual units of glowing green circuit cards and as I gazed on them I felt FRAGMENTS of the larger memories they composed.....these were MY memories and I was shown how they were assembled and put together<br /><br />Strangest thing I ever felt and have never been &quot;back there&quot; with MXE since<br /><br />(also have not mixed it with LSD and DOB since)<br /><br />Agree what others have said about low doses of MXE being very nice<br /><br />Reminds me of mild PCP at lower doses......

				I smoked some DMT while on MXE and it was insane.<br /><br />I felt the pure oneness of the universe and everything, but it started as an energy at the base of my spine and then it shot straight up to my pineal gland which exploded with the most godly euphoric energy feeling that was like 1000x better than an orgasm on ecstasy.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t move/talk/do anything while this happened, I just felt that I was one with everything and that I had touched the small piece of god(cosmic consciousness) that was inside me, and connected to everything else in the cosmos. <br /><br />It was miraculous.

Trust me, I know that feeling...I had been IVing heroin daily for 8 years and had some of the lowest days of my life during that time, and then I lost both of my jobs due to some felony arrests and lost my apartment because of spending so much on heroin. 3 years later and I&#039;m doing much better, I still occasionally use every few months but I now look forward to things in my life and have met some new friends that I know are there for me. I did a lot of fucked up things when I was younger but once I grew older I kinda grew out of it all and started appreciating the small things in life if that makes sense.<br /><br />Just hang in there man!

				I know what you mean about the benzos first.<br /><br />A few nights ago i took 4mg and smoked some weed, then went through my stash.<br /><br />For the next few hours i vaped 2-300mg of nn dmt and 250mg 5-meo-dmt. Mixing the 2 together with scales at first then just eyeballing.<br />To no disastrous effect, but i still know where you&#039;re coming from ;D

				First time I&#039;ve ever posted on the internet but the suicide line compelled me to say something. Try cannabidiol (CBD) if you have access to a high cbd strain of weed: antidepressant, antipsychotic, anti anxiety etc etc Also very good for all types of addiction, be it alcohol, heroin, meth. You&#039;ve tried everything else under the sun how bout some happiness, can&#039;t OD on that.
