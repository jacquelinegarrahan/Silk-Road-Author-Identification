				Hey, looking for a new drug to add to my &quot;party arsenal&quot;, I&#039;m usually more of a psychedelics guy with a side of MDMA, but finding that is the only real party drug I have, and don&#039;t particularly like using it as often as I actually go out to do stuff.&nbsp; I despise alcohol and still need to experiment a bit more with 2c-i and see if it works out for me...<br /><br />Anyway, by my criteria I&#039;ve somehow ended up curious about cocaine, and there&#039;s a lot of information that makes me a bit nervous about trying it, mostly the adulterants.&nbsp; So questions:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; What purity should I look for to really get the most out of it?&nbsp; Assume money isn&#039;t an issue and I&#039;m willing to pay top dollar for the best quality possible.&nbsp; Washed or unwashed?&nbsp; What&#039;s the difference?<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Who is the most legit domestic US seller?&nbsp; And furthur, who consistently has the best product?&nbsp; I.e. smooth, euphoric, basically the best to try my first supply out with?&nbsp; I really would like to get the full experience, basically.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; General safety tips/advice?&nbsp; I can have an addictive personality but I tend to be able to curb my urges with some things, particularly drugs that aren&#039;t physically addicting (I&#039;m led to believe cocaine isn&#039;t physically addicting, so I am pretty sure I can moderate my use...or is this foolish to believe?&nbsp; What&#039;s a common amount to rail at a time, and how frequently?&nbsp; How much do you go through in a night of partying or in a session?<br /><br />4)&nbsp; How does one take cocaine on the go?&nbsp; It seems a bit tricky to have everything set up at a concert or event.&nbsp; Is it possible to store hits in a gelatin capsule, pop it and snort out of the open capsule or is it too dense that way?<br /><br />Any other general tips or advice appreciated.&nbsp;

I think its a dirty drug. never tried it :) [don&#039;t mean to offend those who do]<br /><br />but C is defintely fucking addictive, but i dont think its over rated at all. i like being able to get come down within 30mins.. If i want to stay up, i re-dose.

				Coke is way over rated. If you want a party drug buy some meth. Way more bang for the buck. Don&#039;t worry about getting addicted to coke. You will buy some, snort a couple lines and then go is that it? Oh did I mention it&#039;s way over rated? Also Heroin isn&#039;t nearly as bad as they claim. I love my opiates and will take heroin withdrawal any day over most prescription opiates.

I ended up considerring coke only because of the fact it&#039;s literally 30 min from down to up and back to down again, or so I hear, so I can cut it off whenever and be sober enough to drive on demand.<br /><br />That&#039;s my reasoning so far...but yeah, I have all I need for deep introspective tripping, I need some party substances for my utility belt :p
