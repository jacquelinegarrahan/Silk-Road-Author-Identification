				I know you have to keep the tabs between your lips because your stomach will destroy the drug, but you can order a lot more NBOMe in powder form, but you can&#039;t just capsule &amp; swallow then... Putting powder in your lip seems messy... What am I supposed to do? Lines? Weighing out a 1mg line would be god awful but I do have a milligram scale.

				Most people snort it, although I&#039;ve read reports of people smoking(?) it.

				Hmm alright thanks.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;ve seen people mention vaping it on here too, that just seems so narsty for my poor lungs. <br /><br />Guess there&#039;s no other way to ingest it unless you plug, which isn&#039;t my thing, or injecting, and I&#039;m sure as shit not going to shoot some unresearched psychedelic straight into my veins...

				Don&#039;t even attempt to weigh out 1mg doses. Seriously don&#039;t even try it unless you have a death wish. Those cheap scales from Ebay/Amazon are not accurate enough and there is nothing you can do to make it more accurate.

				it is impossible to accurately weigh a dose of nbome, around a mg with a mg scale, because the range of accuracy is at least +/- 5 mg in either direction... you could end up taking nearly 7 mg thinking it was 2.&nbsp; With the non-linear dose-response curve and highly vasoconstrictive properties one would certainly at least be in a potentially dangerous situation.<br /><br />this is why people just buy the tabs, its easier and safer if you dont know what you are doing... <br /><br />your expectations are completely misguided if you think you can cut a line of 1 mg! lol, a single mg is hardly a speck large enough to bump without losing just from residue sticking<br /><br />if you are set on obtaining the powder you absolutely MUST use a method of volumetric measurement to accurately split into doses. search for it on these forums.&nbsp; then you can just make your own tabs with the liquid of the correct concentration. i believe EtOH works well as a solvent for the nbome series but may be mistaken on that.
