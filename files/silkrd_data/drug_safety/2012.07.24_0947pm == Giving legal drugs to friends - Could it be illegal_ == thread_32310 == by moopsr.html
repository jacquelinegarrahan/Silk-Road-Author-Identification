				I&#039;m hoping this isn&#039;t the wrong section but it seemed the most appropriate.<br /><br />I ordered a shitload of 25i-NBOMe 600micg snortable capsules last week and since I loved the experience I decided to share it with some friends. While most enjoyed the experience, one of them was having a bad trip in the end and considered calling an ambulance.<br />My countries&#039; laws doesn&#039;t ban 25i-NBOMe either explicitly or implicitly. The law doesn&#039;t consider analogs of the banned drugs, only isomers, so it&#039;s completely legal. He also took it willingly and consciously, I didn&#039;t pressure him into anything. He was planning to do a psychedelic for a long time and I just gave it to him, happily.<br />He was concerned about what could happen to me if he told the truth to the doctors, so he was planning to tell them that he took LSD that some random guy gave to him.<br />Even though imho it would be very probable that they would give him the same treatment for both substances, I was still afraid that for some reason the doctors could screw up for not knowing the truth.<br />Fortunately everything went all right and he was able to get out of the bad trip and enjoy it again.<br /><br />I&#039;m still willing to share the psychedelic experience with whomever wants to, and there&#039;s a girl who asked me to trip with her. She has no experience on psychedelics and drugs at all, and don&#039;t think she&#039;s ever made some research into the subject. She wants it because she loves The Doors.<br />While I&#039;m absolutely sure that any of my friends wouldn&#039;t rat me out for any reason, I don&#039;t find this girl very trustworthy and she&#039;s a little bit unstable.<br /><br />So my questions are:<br />a) If I were to give her a capsule, should I take something else with me in case she starts to have a bad trip (trazodone, diazepam, etc.)?<br />b) Could I have some problems with the law if for some reason she has a bad trip, decides to tell the doctors the truth or something like that?

Even at work people know that I love psychedelics and I also don&#039;t make much of an effort to try to hide it. It would be pretty obvious that I gave her the 25i-NBOMe.

				You made a mistake by telling an unstable girl that you do drugs at all, you certainly should not give her any. It&#039;s not an issue of if it&#039;s going to help her or not, you will have given drugs to an untrustworthy and emotionally imbalanced girl. You would be absolutely naive to think that isn&#039;t going to bite you in the ass in some way sooner or later. Look out for yourself.<br /><br />And fuck I hope for your sake you didn&#039;t tell her where you get them from..

It seemed to me a very easy psychedelic to ride on, but I&#039;ll let it die out.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like she&#039;s unstable to the point where she thinks about suicide all day. She&#039;s more like unstable due to the fact that she&#039;s got a poor self-esteem and can&#039;t make her mind over simple things so she keeps changing her mind over and over.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And fuck I hope for your sake you didn&#039;t tell her where you get them from..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I didn&#039;t, but why?

				Because a pissed off emotionally imbalanced girl is bad news. If she ever turns on you you can bet your ass she will start mouthing off to get you into trouble. <br /><br />Shit, I dated a girl like that once. The cunt actually introduced me to drugs in the first place, and when I broke up with her she called my parents and told them what I do under the guise that she &quot;still cares and is worried about me&quot;. <br /><br />Thankfully that was before I started shopping here, but it was still stress and drama that I really didn&#039;t need. You have to be very careful about who you share this aspect of your life with.

				DO NOT GIVE THAT GIRL DRUGS....M&#039;kay? :)<br /><br />Before ever giving anyone psychedelics of any kind, ask them why they want the said psychedelic. If and only if their answer corresponds to either of the four options below should you give in and give them the said psychedelic. If their answer doesn&#039;t match either of the possiblities, they&#039;re not mature enough and should be denied no matter what, until their answer changes to something appropriate. ;)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is the goal? Classic Hinduism suggests four possibilities:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Increased personal power, intellectual understanding, sharpened insight into self and culture, improvement of life situation, accelerated learning, professional growth.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Duty, help of others, providing care, rehabilitation, rebirth for fellow men.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Fun, sensuous enjoyment, esthetic pleasure, interpersonal closeness, pure experience.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Trancendence, liberation from ego and space-time limits; attainment of mystical union. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The manual&#039;s primary emphasis on the last goal does not preclude other goals - in fact, it guarantees their attainment because illumination requires that the person be able to step out beyond problems of personality, role, and professional status. The initiate can decide beforehand to devote their psychedelic experience to any of the four goals. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, if you&#039;re the one giving your friends these drugs you take full responsibility over them until that trip is over. So that friend that had the bad trip is your fault. Unless you trust that person to work through their bad trip like an adult, you should have had some benzos stashed away for just such an emergency. You&#039;re dealing with people&#039;s minds here, don&#039;t take that lightly. &gt;:( Know that it&#039;s people like you who get these drugs banned and changed to illegal, regardless you should always tell the doctor the truth because every drug is different and therefor may have different contraindications. <br /><br />For cases like these though, the doctor won&#039;t be able to help much other than sedate them if they&#039;re a danger to themselves or others so I wouldn&#039;t even bother, just be sure to have benzos so you can sedate them yourself. Now I know you&#039;ve said you haven&#039;t, but for Pete&#039;s sake don&#039;t ever tell anyone about the Silk Road because that&#039;s fucking idiotic to the extreme. Also that girl sounds bipolar or something fucked up like that so just avoid mixing her and psychedelics altogether as they can bring up even more latent psychological problems that even she didn&#039;t know she had. Wouldn&#039;t you hate to have it on your unconscious if she became a schizo as a result of your actions? :(

				Fortunately the drug policies of the country where I live in are more sensible than most of the world so I don&#039;t have much to hide.<br /><br />I&#039;m an admitted psychedelic lover, even with my parents. I tried to explain how meaningful can a psychedelic experience be but my mom doesn&#039;t think it&#039;s funny at all, even though she&#039;s also interested in the mysteries of consciousness. She puts all the drugs on the same bag, and for her all the drugs are bad but drinking alcohol occasionally is okay - I find it sad and try to explain but guess she&#039;ll never know :/<br />She gets a little relieve when she sees that I&#039;m having excellent grades at school and that I&#039;m considering to take a course in biochemistry to understand the drugs better, maybe then she will trust me.<br /><br />For me, doing drugs is like being gay. It has existed since the beginning of the human race, doesn&#039;t affect anyone who doesn&#039;t do it and somehow society decided it is incorrect and tries to fight this aspect by making it something to be ashamed of and making it illegal. Smarter people soon realizes it is impossible to stop it but the rest will want to ban it at all costs, even tho it shouldn&#039;t affect their lives. <br />I hope that in some years we will look at at past and see our current drug policy the same way we look at the gay policy of the past.<br /><br />For me, not hiding my passion of drugs is like coming out of the closet. I do them responsibly and try to come out as someone who can be a highly productive and responsible citizen. Sometimes it&#039;s hard but fortunately people have accepted me the way I am, and I think it&#039;s a good thing to fight for.<br /><br />(sorry if I&#039;m not making much sense, I&#039;m almost sleeping on the keyboard)

				You know i discovered a drug that is bascially an off switch to psychedelics. Mirtazapine. You should always have this on hand if you have people trying LSD or any other tryptamines for the first time. It is an off switch, bascially its a silent antagonist on the main receptors that LSD interacts with. Take 15-30mg tablets. in half an hour no more LSD trip and it will feel like you haven&#039;t sleep in a week. I know its a bit late for this advice. But at least you know now.

Sure, if it is you&#039;re doctor they will not discuss or give out your medical records. But the girl could easily give consent to her doctors to discuss everything and anything. Furthermore, medical records which directly relate to a criminal investigation are discoverable in a criminal trial to a certain extent. The privilege merely means that your attorneys get to read the records first, and request redaction of anything irrelevant. If there is relevant discussions of drugs though, that is discoverable in many cases. <br /><br />you&#039;re right though, don&#039;t give any crazy girl drugs and don&#039;t trust anybody who loves the Doors.

Tell that to the woman raped by the alcoholic, or the kids going without dinner coz their mum spent the food money shooting up.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go into too much of a socio-political discussion here (I really can&#039;t be bothered right now :P), but I understand why some drugs have been made illegal. Does it solve the issues? In most cases no, it just makes them worse for the individual (i.e driving up the price, driving people to other crime) and society as a whole (i.e. becoming a funding source for more serious crime, gangs, ect...) But I understand (but don&#039;t agree with, obviously) the politics.
