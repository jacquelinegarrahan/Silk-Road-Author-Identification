				Try to tell yourself not to secrete saliva, and when I do, I swallow it quickly, before it reaches the 25i... First time I ended up having a gallon of spit in my mouth, just tell yourself you&#039;re not going to secrete saliva, and it is better to keep your saliva in. 25i isn&#039;t active orally so swallowing it wont work. Put under tongue or between lips and teeth

				I took a 1200ug tab (I&#039;m fairly sure it&#039;s around that too, since the trip was incredible, buy from Heineman) and I caved in to swallowing saliva but it still worked amazingly. I don&#039;t think a lot of the saliva touched the tab however, it was firmly under my tongue.

				The better way to do it is to put the blotter on your UPPER lip. Between your gum and your upper lip I mean. You can then swallow normally and go about normally without having to think about it. After about an hour or 45 minutes you can spit it out and you&#039;re all set. You&#039;ll feel a bit of a chemical burn there for a few hours but not a big deal.
