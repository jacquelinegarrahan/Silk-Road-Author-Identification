				Last time I took 140mg of pure mdma it all was a bit too heavy for me...don&#039;t get me wrong, it felt amazing but I don&#039;t do MDMA to get fucked up, I&#039;m more interested in the therapeutic benefits.<br /><br />So I&#039;m curious about my next dose....I have a 145mg pill (the blue ghost) from a different vendor. If I take half of it to start and then half later...is that a waste of mdma or does that sound like a good way for me to ease into it? Or shall I take 3/4ths of the pill then re-up later with the remaining 1/4th? I&#039;m inclined to start small and work my way up but am confused when I read things like this: from a reputable mdma vendor in the forums &quot;All we can say is to drop a whole one from the start next time. MDMA is funny wherein you need to pass a certain threshold in order for it&#039;s true effects to manifest.&quot; <br /><br />Best,<br />Woolly

Half the ghost will give you a nice buzz, with the empathy associated with mdma. I did the last half of my two pills over the weekend too and although I didn&#039;t get much of a rush, I like the gentle x buzz sometimes.<br /><br />When I used to be heavy into the rave scene I used to do halfs a lot to start my night and take the other half, or a full pill a few hours later.<br /><br />A half ghost will also be a good dose if you smoke weed, but weed enhances the effect.<br /><br />If you do want to redose on e, always wait a couple hours before you do. Different pills can have different onsets. I&#039;ve had a lot of friends take a second pill thinking they were bunk, then get floored. <br /><br />Stay safe and have fun!

I have a friend who took 140mg once at home and had a good experience but nothing that blew the hinges off. The same friend took 140mg of the same batch at a festival and had to sit down because of how intense it became (he said it was almost a bit too much). Keep in mind that setting matters, the energy around you like at a fesitval can greatly enhance the feeling.<br /><br />Also keep in mind that MDMA dosing is not linear. 140mg may have been too intense because it was just a few mg more than your sweet spot. Just 10mg less at 130mg could be you perfect dose, you really just have to try a few different dosages to find out, but starting lower is typically a better way of doing this. Finding the sweet spot is difficult, but I consider it to be the dosage where the euphoria is maximized while the impairment is minmized. For most people who are new to mdma this is between 100-120mg. <br /><br />My suggestion would be to take 3/4th of the 145mg pill, then about 1.5 hours later take the other 1/4. That means you&#039;d have approx. 110mg to start, then 35mg as a booster at the 1.5 hour mark. <br />

				I find the small boosters don&#039;t really do anything except extend the duration.&nbsp; In fact, I&#039;d rather take some 2CB at T-3:00 rather than redose. <br /><br />It&#039;s a pity you don&#039;t have powder, because then you could taylor your dose.&nbsp; Pills are rubbish for that, as you&#039;ve just found out.<br /><br />Next time, get a gram of powder/rocks, so then you can find the dose that&#039;s best for you.<br /><br />And yeah, like Entre said, set and setting is everything.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d recomend doing half then when ur hands get sweaty and ur pupils dialate do the rest. I normally take 120 mg to start then 80 when I start to feel it. Seems like the best wat I&#039;ve found

				Thank you all for the great knowledge! <br /><br />Another factor I forgot to mention...my 140mg experience was coupled with lots of grapefruit juice...maybe that made it stronger than usual because of its enzyme blocking action? <br /><br />I&#039;ll either start with half or 3/4ths of the blue ghost...touch call. It&#039;s too bad the ghosts are listed with a range of 140-150mg...guess it&#039;s hard to be super accurate with a pill. I&#039;ll report back in 2 weeks once it&#039;s down the hatch!
