				I received an order of apparent MDMA. I have my doubts as to what it is. Allow me to describe the drug to you, this is the best that I can do and I appreciate any help that you can give me regarding my description.<br /><br />1. It is grey in colour. Off-white between white and grey. There are dots of black in there. It leads me to think that it could be contaminated but I don&#039;t know what would be small black dots.<br />2. It is ground to a powder. No crystals. Any lumps can easily be broken down into powder not like crystals at all. It is probably very very fine and ground up to a powder from crystals, which would be fine, but it could also be contaminated powder.<br />3. It smells awful. I am very aware of the distinct chemically smell of MDMA (and taste too, I haven&#039;t tasted it yet). I know it soooo well. This does not smell like MDMA at all. It has a sour smell which leads me to think that either it is moldy/ really old or it contains something that isn&#039;t MDMA. The smell is overpowering like pure Speed (that shit disgusts me to the point where I can&#039;t be in the same room as it and this is very similar, I almost vomitted from opening the bag) but it is not stingy it is very sour and musky smell. It&#039;s like sour fish or milk. It could be speed. Even smelling it has given me a headache like speed did in the past (I&#039;m very sensitive to amphetimine and I would be very pissed off if this contained speed).<br /><br />It could also be unreacted methylamine. I&#039;m not an expert but maybe someone here has has MDMA smell like this in the past? Someone else said it was like MDxx.<br /><br />Has anyone any idea what might be inside this? I have messaged the vendor regarding the issue. If I don&#039;t receive an adequate response then I will release his name and encourage people not to use him.

				Sounds a bit suspect, what&#039;s his recent feedback like? Maybe other people will come forward once they realize the product isn&#039;t MDMA.

				Feedback is ace which is why I went for it. I just don&#039;t know if the product shipped was a mistake, or if it is something to do with how mdma is washed.

				Don&#039;t worry about the black specks too much. Burned sass?<br /><br />When MDMA is washed with acetone, the acetone is poured off. I pour mine into a container and it eventually dries into a light fluffy ash grey powder that crumbles to the touch.<br /><br />Clean MDMA that no longer contains &quot;brown&quot; often times has no smell.<br /><br />I&#039;m 100% sure the vendor will make it right if his feedback is as good as you say.<br /><br />I always clean up my mdma. Liquify it, filter it, recrystallize it. Makes me happy knowing my customers get the best, and I&#039;m sure they have no complaints either.<br /><br />Many don&#039;t have the gall to liquify 100g of MDMA. It&#039;s very easy to fuck it up and BOOM $2000 down the toilet. <br /><br />You should post pictures.

				There is a lot of junk MDMA out there (not that I&#039;m a fan of the pure stuff anyways) so your concerns could be justified, but I find it so annoying buyers think they can check purity based on sight. I recently (as in 2 days ago) had a customer send me a nasty message saying that my stuff is shit and is nothing but bath salts and telling me how he took some some yesterday and it made him violently ill and that I&#039;m a fraud and that SR sucks. I sent him long messages back of copied feedback, test results, along with statements of my many years selling having had nothing but stellar amazing raving reviews of my product. You know what his reply was? &quot;Oh sorry, I didn&#039;t really take any, I just looked at it and thought it was most definitely bath salts.... wow, i just took some now, this stuff is great, i&#039;ll order again&quot;.<br /><br />So looking at something is not the best way to determine it&#039;s chemical makeup.

				You can&#039;t go wrong with grabbing yourself a reagent test! It&#039;s a peace of mind tool that will stick with you for this, and future batches. Easily one of my best purchases made, in the back of your mind it&#039;s nice to feel a little bit better about knowing what you&#039;re taking/handling.

				Get a test kit from dancesafe.org, they&#039;re cheap and take like 4 days to get to you.

I have seen a LOT of MDMA over the years, everything from pure white powder to giant brown rocks and tons of variations in between. It&#039;s nearly impossible to determine both legitimacy and quality of this drug by sight. Something that looks appealing may have very little effect or be another substance all together, and something that appears to be cut to absolute shit could be pure fire, I&#039;ve experienced both those things in the past with MDMA.
