				Something keeps irritating me and has been on my mind for a while now. The most popular drug that everyone seems to praise is weed. I for some reason don&#039;t like it. I get completely paranoid, not wanting to speak in case people think what I&#039;m saying is stupid. I get this horrible feeling in my chest which i can&#039;t describe, also a horrible feeling of something is coming. Like something bad is going to happen to me (like someone breaking in or something) And just feeling all around scared.&nbsp; The only time I&#039;d say weed is nice for me is if either with alcohol or MDMA. To take away the overwhelming paranoia I get. Does anyone else dislike weed? Is there anything I can do to get a good feeling from it?

				Na, I wouldn&#039;t say you are the ONLY one, my weed tolerance is very low as well. Shit I know more than a few people that can smoke a blunt or fat ass bowl and be perfectly fine to go out and left weights, play ball, etc. <br /><br />I cannot do this. However the paranoia is really just your mind being more open and you simply &quot;thinking&quot; too much about things you probably shouldn&#039;t. LOL. I remember my sophmore year of college I moved into a house with a few roomates and we initially didn&#039;t put curtains on the windows. I took a fat ass pull off a bong laced with mad keef and was sure that someone was going to call the cops because they saw all the smoke in the house. Haha. I think for people like us it&#039;s more about setting and surrounding being that we are more of a &quot;social&quot; smoker than a &quot;habit&quot; smoker if there is such a thing. <br /><br />I don&#039;t dislike weed, personally I love the shit. But having kids around the house I cannot smoke like I used too and my tolerance is extremely low to the point where a small rip of some good weed out of a pipe or bowl just plumb fucks me up. I can take 3-4 10MG Norco&#039;s though and be perfectly fine however. <br /><br />Just effects some folks differently, but again- I love weed and will smoke it if its there.

				Sounds like you have or are predisposed to some type of anxiety. I say so because I had the same experience for the longest time. For the first 2 years of my weed smoking career, I was completely fine and loved it. The next year or so I would always get social anxiety which led me to smoking alone most of the time.<br /><br />You just have to get over it. Reason through your paranoia, take chances, and it&#039;ll pass. My buddy used to be deathly afraid of smoking and driving his car for that exact same reason, horrible paranoia. He had it for years, up until I got him really high, and he had an emergency and had to drive a pretty good ways away stoned out of his mind. Ever since then he actually loves driving stoned and says it&#039;s really relaxing for him.<br /><br />Just get your anxiety out of your mind, and try to control your overwhelming rush of thoughts that come through when it happens. The feeling in your chest as well as the feeling of something bad happening imminently, sounds like a slight panic attack. Again, it can be controlled, and you&#039;ll get to the point where you won&#039;t have it anymore. Figure out what the trigger is, if it&#039;s who you&#039;re with, or where you&#039;re at, or even just smoking weed. If that&#039;s the case, then I would probably take a short break, and if it continues on and you can&#039;t get past it, then take a permanent break.<br /><br />These sound like very simple solutions, but it takes practice to keep your anxiety controlled and eventually watch it disappear.

				Try some sativa weed for paranoia, Its a difference between night and day from indica. Cause lets face it, &quot;daytime&quot; weed doesn&#039;t make you paranoid much. You should want to go out and do things and interact after being high on sativa. It will stimulate and energize you if its good sativa. Just hit up the visine for red eyes before going outside, heh.

				Liked it originally, but I think my problem is moreso with the culture than with weed itself. I like to take a quick puff myself to get a little high, but pretty much everybody else I know that smokes treats it like a macho competition. Basically what happens is we all get so high we&#039;re couch-locked and we&#039;ve all forgotten how to talk. It&#039;s uncomfortable imo.

				I have an anxiety disorder. If I get too stoned I will get this uncomfortable feeling in my chest, and if it&#039;s bad enough will start to panic. It&#039;s not my only trigger, but after having a work-related panic attack while I was high it kind of became a trigger for a while. Not all that bad as I took a break from weed, and when I started back learned how to manage. Now I just take a couple of hits at a time from my pipe. Just enough to feel high &amp; relaxed without feeling uncomfortable. As long as I smoke just enough it really does wonders for my anxiety &amp; stress. Just if I get too high it does the opposite.

				I used to be a huge pothead from 16-22. Then, something changed and I started getting like you described (paranoia, anxiety, fear, etc.). Even that &quot;not wanting to speak in case people think I&#039;m stupid&quot; I have had probably since the get-go. For me, it coincided during a time where I was going through a lot of death anxiety, even while sober. Being stoned + constantly think about your inevitable death = SHIIIITY! Once that passed I smoked a few more times, and as long as I didn&#039;t do too much I was fine. I know some people who will literally only take 1 hit, and then they can get really into being stoned, but never have the paranoia that comes with getting blazed. Try doing just 1 puff and see how the next 30 mins goes. Starting out, your body might take a while to realize it&#039;s stoned, so you might have been doing too much before you realized it was too late.

				you might just be smoking too much - i can go from laughing my head off to a paranoid wreck (proper &#039;they&#039;re coming to get me&#039; state) in a couple of tokes. if you wanna see what all the fuss is about start with just a couple of tokes then leave it for half hour, then go back to it, 2 more tokes then leave it.

				This is how it works: <br /><br />You need to smoke MORE. <br /><br />If you smoke increasingly you will get more and more used to it and prefer more and more. <br /><br />One way to not feel so anxious and self analytical n such is to smoke tiny tokes gradually throughout the day until your preferring to smoke huge rips. The more you smoke, the more you prefer smoking more. <br /><br />And sorry, sativa is way more paranoia invoking than indica. Sativa is CEREBRAL much more than indica which is more body stone. You can also experiment with edibles, bud cookies but be VERY careful with dosage, start extremely small and wait over an hour to try any more and continue waiting an hour after any increased increment. Edibles can be more psychedelic on the brain and if you overdue it you can have a miserable experience. But hit it just right, and it&#039;s extremely pleasant and feels great! <br /><br />I&#039;ve been a smoker since early teens and it wasn&#039;t until late twenties that I finally had a GOOD experience on edibles by hitting just the right dosage. <br /><br />Overall I&#039;ve always struggled with difficulty with anxiousness, uncomfortableness in public, and it simply comes down to tolerance and habit. If you really want to be a hardcore stoner you have to smoke until it stops feeling awkward. ANYONE who has been a regular smoker who stops for a day/week etc... KNOWS THIS because after they take a huge rip after not smoking awhile, we ALL get wayyy high and don&#039;t know what to do with ourselves. <br /><br />But taking baby hits can be great because you get just a head change and it can be a fun experience. But even when I don&#039;t smoke for a long while, I can take just a single half hit and get wayyy too high! All in all, I seek staying off the bud, knowing that inner peace and inner stillness is found through no habitually smoking thc. And it certainly seriously GRIPS a mofo if you get to the chronic phase. It can be tough to get out of it once deep in habit. <br /><br />It becomes a way of life. Smoking, daily, constantly. Great for awhile. I&#039;ll probably get back there again and have to rip myself away from it once again. Just remember, practice makes perfect! Best to you.

				The first time I smoked I smoked an sativa that made me feel very euphoric and happy. I believe it was blueberry kush. Second time I smoked it was &quot;Alaskan Thunder Fuck&quot; a strain I&#039;ve only ever scene at my old town. That was clearly indica, but it didn&#039;t made me feel anxious at all.<br />About a year or two after I stopped smoking, I noticed that I was having issues holding my smoke. I&#039;ve smoked cannabis laced with something before, most likely a pesticide, and could easily tell. It sent me right into an anxiety attack. And after having a horrible experience from a spice that is now banned in my state, I was going to cannabis for my new relaxing drug. When I felt that the cannabis was no longer relaxing me, I realized that I had anxiety. I&#039;ve had anxiety disorder before this, and get panic attacks almost three times a week on average that come with horrible headaches with feelings of pressure around my eye.<br /><br />Best way to stop this? Stop smoking the &quot;good shit&quot; from your friend down the street and start off smoking something that gives you a stoned feeling, but it isn&#039;t so much you notice it. Good quality buds make your heart rate increase, which will cause you to panic. (This also means if you are going to have a heart attack that day, the cannabis will just make it come on faster, so don&#039;t worry about anything like that.) I recently smoked with my friend. I had zero tolerance at the time, and took a fairly big hit off my friends bong before returning home with my girlfriend. I went upstairs and laid down, playing music on my computer. I could tell I was stoned and didn&#039;t care, until I heard my chest. I got minor pain in my upper left chest, and my girlfriend who was laying her head on my chest could tell it was beating too fast. She kept keeping track of the beat of my heart, and this made me VERY anxious.<br /><br />In the short run, it is all in your head, yes. However that doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t a real problem. I&#039;d suggest fixing your anxiety before smoking, or starting off with alright buds and working up to the stickiest of the sticky. :P

				Last summer I smoked almost every day and loved it. Last time I smoked I got a horrible nauseous feeling crashed onto the floor and banged my head up, laid there for like 5 minutes before I could even move. No idea how that happened but since discovering psychedelics I could care less about MJ anyway

				I know a guy, a very professional toxicologist. He claims that reaction to the cannabis is &#039;strictly individual&#039;. He had some patients whose reaction to the weed was ZERO: no mental and almost none vegetative.

				You are not the only one, I tried weed once and never again. I just felt my head become cloudy, everything became slow and then THE MOST intense paranoia ever engulfed me! I walked back to the house, climbed into bed, pulled the covers over my head and tried to sleep. My friend got the munchies and just kept offering me a sandwich, I said no, I want to sleep. I don&#039;t like this. The next week I felt &quot;slow&quot;. <br />I thought it was just bad weed, but 3 big tokes and it hit me. I have had 2 other experiences with weed, where I only took 2 small tokes (of presumably weak weed) and got a slight mood lift.<br />I am not particularly sensitive to stimulants, alcohol etc. and can handle lots...<br />

				Same here OP. Its not like I totally freak out, it just feels pretty uncomfortable and I usually just end up eating, drinking tea or coffee, vaping, jerk off and then straight to bed. All this in 1-2 hours. No matter how early it is, it makes me sleepy and tired as fuck. I guess I havent tried any pure sativa, probably should, its just hard to find cause most weed even the ones called &quot;sativa&quot; are usually hybrids, atleast they feel pretty much the same to me.<br /><br />The first time I tried really proper weed was in a Coffeeshop in Adam. I just bought one prerolled&nbsp; joint and smoked half of it. Damn it hit me hard! I was afraid of standing up not to mention leaving the place. Its a pretty nasty feeling like everyones judging you and looking at you or something. I was there for maybe 20 minutes, but it felt like an hour! Time always goes really slow on weed, dunno why. <br /><br />Best experience with Cannabis I have had was when I tried Swch´s Swiss hashish. That was really nice and smooth, didnt make me cough like most weed does and I could actually do stuff while on it. Not just feeling tired and lazy.

				If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned about drug use (and weed, especially) over the last few years, it&#039;s that everyone reacts to drugs differently. I have friends who are heroin addicts; I enjoyed it as a weekend-thing for a while, and recently quit. Some people do MDMA as a party drug every coupla months, and that&#039;s it; I have an incredibly strong compulsion for the drug, and find it hard not to take it more than I should.<br /><br />Some people smoke weed all day erry day and love it. Some people smoke and become incredibly paranoid. I used to be the former; after a year or more of use, I became the latter. I smoke every once in a blue moon, and I must be alone when I do it.

				I quite honestly am not a fan of smoking weed. I had jack herer last week rolled up 1 small doobie and smoked it (Chose that strain because it&#039;s sativa). I didn&#039;t feel quite right, it felt like my eyes were being pinched then I looked in the rearview mirror and realized my fucking pupils were almost gone, I did get the munchies and had to grab a cheeseburger at mcdonalds however I became quite paranoid not sure if it was because I was worrying if my driving was going to be impaired. Didn&#039;t enjoy it at all because the smoke really bothered my throat and chest. (I have asthma if thats an excuse) I&#039;m thinking I may like to try edibles next time like some cookies or brownies if im just chilling around the house. but I ended up just giving the 7G&#039;s to my uncle for $60 lol

				I HATE weed, on very small amounts I get paranoid, and very anxious.&nbsp; On moderate to large amounts I get terrible eye pains and extremely uncomfortable feelings in my body.&nbsp; Though when I was living with a buddy who smoked all the time I had rashes on my hands and I used the same brand of hand soap for a year prior to this.&nbsp; Perhaps the pain is from allergies to some chemical in marijuana.

				Yeah same, I can&#039;t stand puff. Just makes me lazy, paranoid and stupid.

				Same for me. When I first started smoking I had no anxiety what-so-ever from weed. It made me feel relaxed, hungry, things seemed funny, it was nice. This lasted for several years. After taking a break and returning to it, I first started to experience paranoia from it. This went away after continued use as my tolerance came back, but it is worth noting that I did not have such paranoia when I started smoking in the first place. I find that when I take any significant break, even of a week or two now, that when I start up again I get bad anxiety. These days it seems to come and go in waves. Sometimes I can smoke a ton of weed and just enjoy the experience. Other times smoking small amounts causes extreme paranoia. I have somewhat come to even like the paranoid trips it gives me though. Mind racing at a&nbsp; million miles per hour, but when taking control of this + the increase in abstract thinking and creativity it can be like a super smart drug for me, at least it seems so when I am in such a state of mind ;). I took some orally and it was to much though, it caused me to shake violently + paranoia , never had shakes before. <br /><br />So yeah it is hit or miss for me, sometimes relaxing and fun, sometimes my mind races but I can channel that energy in a pleasant way, and sometimes I am extremely paranoid and violently shaking and absolutely hate the experience. But I take the chance still and smoke on occasion, sometimes regularly and sometimes with months in between sessions. The more often I use the less likely I am to have unpleasant experiences. Sometimes I get entirely lost in my mind after I smoke and my body goes almost completely on autopilot while I am quite literally stuck in deep thought. Weed actually makes it much easier for me to entirely filter out the external world and enter into my mind and thoughts, to the point that it is actually difficult to &#039;escape&#039; from thought to pay any attention to / interact with my surroundings. This coupled with racing thoughts can be an amazing experience though, laser focus on train of thought that goes at a billion miles per hour is enjoyable for me, but does come at the cost of temporary near-total inability to interact with external stimuli.

				Pretty familiar stuff. I&#039;m mid 30&#039;s now and smoked a lot in my late teens / early 20s (daily for about 4 years i guess). Always felt good, relaxed, like it should. After a personal crisis suddenly the relaxed feeling was replaced with anxiety. My advice is, go see a doctor or get some other medical advice (or just stop ofcourse). <br /><br />Doing a full-body checkup already deminishes the panic attack as you know it&#039;s nearly impossible to get a heart attack in your 20s. If your lucky you might even get prescribed some Xanax or whatever, which is chill also :)<br /><br />I did cut down after the panic attacks, but somehow i always wanted that relaxed feeling to return. You know, watching a movie or just really enjoying some new records. Currently it&#039;s quite under control as i started working on my physcal shape as well (running etc.). And i use a lot of alcohol (well alot , 3 or 4 beers) before smoking, the alcohol helps surpressing the anxiety. <br /><br />You have to realize though the anxiety is purely a mental thing, even a small toke from a joint with mild bud can trigger such a state. <br /><br />While on the subject, i remember an excellent article on salon.com a few years back describing why a people stop smoking when they turn 30. Can&#039;t find the link now, but it was in the line of that you basically leaving your worry free 20&#039;s life behind you and replacing it all kinds of obligations (work, mortgage, kids). So getting your shit together, removing any negative stimuli, also helps in toning the anxiety.

I do smoke constantly all day, especially now that I have Buddermans e-liquid THC. <br />When I was younger, I admit to trying to get my friends to try it. But, I wanted them to like it, so I always started them with just one hit. Your 1st time is too intense if you do more than one hit, I think. Like any drug, you gotta work your way into it. But I agree, youngsters have the &quot;challenge&quot; aura about them. Did you not drink yourself into oblivion with those same friends? Seeing who could drink who &quot;under the table?&quot; <br />I will also note, I don&#039;t think teens should puff, as in your teens it REALLY sucks away your motivation. At least, it did mine. But back then, I was also a big tweeker, so I was chemically motivated, lol.

				It is the same for me. I used to smoke every day for a few years when suddenly one night with my friends I had a massive panic attack that lasted for about two hours. It was weird because up to then I had had no bad experiences with drugs and wasn&#039;t an anxious person. But after that experience I couldn&#039;t smoke weed without having a panic attack unless I was drunk or I took a benzo. It sucks. I miss it soooooooo muchhhhhh. I know the anxiety is &quot;all in my head&quot; and I have tried time and time again to talk myself out of it but it pretty much always reappears.

				For the guys that have this problem, is it possible that you were simply smoking the wrong strains?&nbsp; The difference between strains can be like night and day for many of the effects, both short-term and long term.<br /><br />I used to smoke copious amounts of hash and strong indicas, in an effort to control my fucked-up sleep pattern.&nbsp; They did the job well enough, but I was down and depressed a lot of the time, and couldn&#039;t be arsed doing much.&nbsp; After I started growing, I tried a few sat-dom strains, and found that they were great anti-depressants, more effective than anything my doc had ever given me.&nbsp; Now I prefer these strains for my everyday smoke, with a just small amount of something more couch-lock for the end of the day.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the med users in the UK and elsewhere who are unable to source specific strains directly.&nbsp; Just going to a dealer and asking for a 20 bag of whatever is available a terrible state of affairs, for someone who would benefit from a specific plant profile.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				The first few times I did weed I absolutely hated it. Horrible paranoia.<br /><br />A few years later I did it with some good friends and had an awesome time. I chalk up the poor early experiences to not being comfortable.<br /><br />Weed, to me, is an emotion magnifier. Whatever you&#039;re feeling, it will triple it (at least).<br /><br />If you&#039;re feeling good, you&#039;ll feel awesome. If bad, so horrible that every thought will make you feel like the worst person on Earth. If a little worried, paranoid as fuck. The secret is to only smoke when you&#039;re already feeling good.<br /><br />Another secret of mine: once the initial high fades and you&#039;re left with the hours-long residual high (where you&#039;re not high but not sober either, and still can&#039;t think straight), take a shot or two of liquor. The effects of the weed and alcohol will cancel out, and you&#039;ll feel sober.

The more you smoke, the more you prefer smoking more. <br /><br />And sorry, sativa is way more paranoia invoking than indica. Sativa is CEREBRAL much more than indica which is more body stone. You can also experiment with edibles, bud cookies but be VERY careful with dosage, start extremely small and wait over an hour to try any more and continue waiting an hour after any increased increment. Edibles can be more psychedelic on the brain and if you overdue it you can have a miserable experience. But hit it just right, and it&#039;s extremely pleasant and feels great! <br /><br />I&#039;ve been a smoker since early teens and it wasn&#039;t until late twenties that I finally had a GOOD experience on edibles by hitting just the right dosage. <br /><br />Overall I&#039;ve always struggled with difficulty with anxiousness, uncomfortableness in public, and it simply comes down to tolerance and habit. If you really want to be a hardcore stoner you have to smoke until it stops feeling awkward. ANYONE who has been a regular smoker who stops for a day/week etc... KNOWS THIS because after they take a huge rip after not smoking awhile, we ALL get wayyy high and don&#039;t know what to do with ourselves. <br /><br />But taking baby hits can be great because you get just a head change and it can be a fun experience. But even when I don&#039;t smoke for a long while, I can take just a single half hit and get wayyy too high! All in all, I seek staying off the bud, knowing that inner peace and inner stillness is found through no habitually smoking thc. And it certainly seriously GRIPS a mofo if you get to the chronic phase. It can be tough to get out of it once deep in habit. <br /><br />It becomes a way of life. Smoking, daily, constantly. Great for awhile. I&#039;ll probably get back there again and have to rip myself away from it once again. Just remember, practice makes perfect!

And every time I come to the same conclusion: me and weed don&#039;t work well together.<br />BHN, I understand that you are recommending to &quot;just power through it&quot;.

BARF<br /><br />(Despite the fact that I work on a (legal) pot farm in the summertimes...)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I only am recommending powering through it if you are interested in getting past the ill anxious effects. Maybe I didn&#039;t clarify enough fully that if you&#039;re not fully interested in becoming a chronic smoker, than certainly move past it and be fine with that. I&#039;ve had enough experience with smoking and not smoking that I seriously believe NOT smoking is the best route in life. I don&#039;t actually share the opinion that a pure chronic lifestyle is anything close to a healthy one. <br /><br />Here&#039;s my deepest belief regarding weed: <br /><br />I believe in a spiritual path. Spiritual as in being &quot;connected&quot; with life. This can be experienced both through chronic pot use and zero use, I experience both. Meaning generally I am connected by being aware of being connected either high or not. But truly being content, connected and at peace within is likely only going to happen through NOT smoking. My belief is, the way to deep inner peace is through stillness. Inner stillness. Weed stimulates your mind and keeps it active. This is great for staying up and being active late, or when totally exhausted, reigniting some brain activity. It works great for sleeping but in my opinion only after many bowls. Or being high all the time. It&#039;s also got so many great medicinal cannabinoids, and all sorts of medicine uses of course. But this can be achieved through ingesting just enough to not have a cerebral effect. So I believe it&#039;s difficult to achieve deep inner peace when your mind is constantly active. Meditation is not aided by weed. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really support chronic pot use as a healthy lifestyle that is growth inspiring. Although I&#039;ll go through bouts of chronic use, it gets so fuckin habitual that it really grips me at times. This is not healthy living. Also worth mentioning is when I stop use, I remember my dreams like crazy and they become more colorful and vivid. I&#039;m currently OFF the herb and set on staying OFF so I can process a lot of emotional baggage I feel I&#039;ve been carrying around for the last couple years that I got so deeply into chronic use. It&#039;s way too easy when it&#039;s always around you! And it&#039;s been a struggle. But when you get off it, after being stuck.... it&#039;s the biggest fucking sigh of relief!!! It&#039;s the best. I&#039;ve had incredible lucid dreams recently as well. AMAZING!<br /><br />But I will say that when I take good breaks (week or more) and I smoke, I&#039;ll have amazing revelations and know exactly where my path needs to go next! And..... then.... I&#039;ll be wayyy too fuckin high, and all weird and anxious all that shit and curse having gotten high hahaha. <br /><br />So, I hope this helps better than my first post. Don&#039;t think that just because everyone smokes that it&#039;s necessary to be a smoker. But when I&#039;ve gone past the getting used to it, and start to enjoy the chronic use, I will say it&#039;s fucking amazing to smoke all the time. Very enjoyable. But only after weening way on. <br />It&#039;s soo tasty, helps to stay awake on long drives, great after meals, before bed... but really, so many times I&#039;ve woken and waked n baked, and I&#039;m like, &quot;shit, didn&#039;t I say I was gonna quit today??&quot;<br /><br />So currently being off it. I am ultra grateful. I&#039;m set on staying off till it&#039;s entirely out of my system. 2 months or more. If it doesn&#039;t work for you, it can if you make it haha. But that doesn&#039;t mean I think you should. I support people doing what they think they should. I also support the notion that chronic use hinders spiritual and personal growth. Most smokers I know, smoke all the time and I&#039;m so glad I&#039;m not stuck on it now. <br /><br />If anyone is struggling with getting off of it.... there&#039;s a company called dragon herbs. They have a chinese herb complex called &quot;Will Power&quot; that I actually bought specifically to help get off the herb. I totally forgot my reason for buying it while taking it. Interestingly enough, that&#039;s exactly when I made the decision to get off and stay off!!! I realized later on and thought well isn&#039;t that funny. Seems to have worked! I recommend the product to help! <br /><br />Thanks! <br />

				I&#039;ve never had a good experience with it and i&#039;ve tried a bunch of different kinds, it just makes me feel like someone&#039;s sitting on my chest for awhile and then i pass out for an hour or so, I like xanax and from what my friends that love weed describe their experience to be like thats what xanax does for me so thats my weapon of choice.<br />

				Don&#039;t really have too much time for weed, defo not a very sociable drug unless its bush/thai stick. Makes me very introspective but it can be have its time and place!<br />As you said, accompanys MD very well and it can be a nice relaxing smoke, but for example i went to a gig earlier tonight pretty blazed and couldn&#039;t be arsed moving/dancing/chattin up girls! Took a pill and felt great tho!<br />I know so many people who can smoke weed like it has no effect but in my experience I&#039;d have to say it&#039;s a very strong drug and it can lead to some very serious problems if used for the wrong reasons!<br />Saying that, when I kept it Organic and only took weed and shrooms I had the time of my life and I did feel rather wholesome but end of the day weed is a very potent substance and the effects can be very unpredictable

				Dude, you don&#039;t have to smoke weed to be cool. As an individual, if you don&#039;t get pleasure from it, why do it? I totally understand your situation as my sister is the same way; it&#039;s a weird juxtaposition for sure, but it&#039;s certainly not that rare.

				This is what I got out of cannabis:<br /><br />- extreme paranoia (I thought people were going to kill me or had already poisoned me)<br />- extreme anxiety (I was afraid I was going to die)<br />- confusion, clumsiness, and&nbsp; just feeling &#039;dumb&#039; in general<br />- dry mouth, throat, and nose<br />- a feeling of heaviness or pressure in my head<br />- difficulty breathing, racing heart<br />- blurred vision<br />- sweaty palms<br />- a burning sensation in my chest<br /><br />

				I know plenty of people who get panic attacks and freak out when they smoke weed for some reason.<br />Could also be the type of weed you smoke. Try a narcotic like indica instead of the paranoid inducing sativa&#039;s.. ?<br />

It think it&#039;s more a psychological reaction, maybe the brains are rewired by to heavy use before, who knows.<br /><br />I went back from decent weed to thai superbullshit stuff, if i stepped down more i would be smoking tea and still got some anxiety (not panic attack kinda stuff but still).<br /><br />The underlying problem seems to be sort of dermant anxiety disorder or stress. Instead of changing your smoking habits you could also see it as an opportunity to deal with these problems through f.i. meditation, yoga, accupuncture, therapy. What helped for me is working on my fysical shape, working out (not to much, just enough ;) and avoiding stressfull situations. Now, i&#039;m an happy weekend smoker again.

				Don&#039;t like it one bit. I lose my train of thought and I try to grasp on to my thoughts which completely fails and I hate that feeling. Losing control of oneself, almost panic attack similarities for me.

				Hey Openwater,<br /><br />I know exactly what you mean, I react in the same way as you do. Stopped smoking some years ago now. I researched a lot on this because I wanted to try LSD and was quite nervous about horror-tripping. LSD is my friend though :)<br /><br />check out this link, might be interesting for you:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J7cZf2tFCQ<br /><br />I guess you are perfectly sane, it is just the substance that tricks your mind.
