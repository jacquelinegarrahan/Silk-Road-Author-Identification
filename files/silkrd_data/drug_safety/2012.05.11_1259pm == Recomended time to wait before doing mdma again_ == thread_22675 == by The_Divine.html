				personally i give it 6 weeks. some people only wait 2 weeks but dose themselves up on 5-htp to restock the brains serotonin levels but this doesn&#039;t work for me and you&#039;ll still have quite a tolerance so you&#039;ll need to neck a bit more each time.<br /><br />i think anything longer than 3 months will give you the best buzz, 3 months should be long enough to let your tolerance drop right down and your brain to be back on full form

				From a scientific viewpoint, I would say it&#039;d be largely specific to the person. <br /><br />MDMA is an agonist of several neurotransmitters such as Dopamine and Serotonin, and the brain relies on secondary molecules to reduce and remove them. The synapses that recognize these neurotransmitters will also have a refractory period when recovering from such an abnormal dosing. If the average given is a month, expect the range to be anywhere from 5-7 days, to 3 months. <br /><br />The only way you&#039;re going to find out is trial and error. The more scientific you make it, the more accurate you will get. First try with the average of a months wait. See how comparable the second dosage is to the first. If there is no difference, reduce time to 3 weeks. Rince and repeat until you find a noticable lack of &#039;oompf&#039;. Then simply scale up until you find your refractory period.<br /><br /><br />Also note that a lot of other factors will affect this, such as hydration, hepatic and renal efficiency, other drug ingestion, and specific levels of enzymes present in your body. <br /><br />I usually take a multivitamin a couple weeks either side of taking drugs to act as precursors to any enzymes my body will need excessses of to cope with the toxicology of the substance. Just a standard cheap one will do, just check the label and make sure it hits all the necessary bases. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s upsetting that I&#039;m so high, I see the red lines and spelling mistakes but my brain can&#039;t retrieve the correct spellings. So this will have to do. If I remember I&#039;ll edit in a sober state and fill out the apparent bro-science with actual science later on.

				Biggest name in the UK is Centrum, not sure about elsewhere. But brand won&#039;t really matter, even the store-own brands here have similar minerals to Centrum at half the price. <br /><br />Just grab any &#039;Multi-vitamin&#039; product. If you have a decent diet then there&#039;s no reason to take them, but often with drugs like MDMA you don&#039;t eat for a while which leaves nutrient deficits.<br /><br />5HTP is an intermediate in the production of serotonin from tryptophan. But it is only one of many. There are only anecdotal reports of its use with MDMA recovery. IIRC 5HTP is over the counter and therefore regulated, so the information that comes with the pills should be accurate. I would recommend taking them for a week or two after taking MDMA to kick start re-synthesis of serotonin. Eating well will help your body out, but the multivitamin will cover any holes in your dietary intake.

				1 month minimum, I would say 6 weeks is not going to have much of a long term effect (unless you use it all your life every 6 weeks). <br /><br />It&#039;s rather annoying because the next time I dose MDMA it will have been 2 and a half months maybe 3 before my last, and before that 3 months before, so I want to use it a lot in the summer but it&#039;s just too harmful! <br /><br />Who&#039;s got alternatives to MDMA which aren&#039;t so damaging?

				I would also agree with the others on this and from personal experience you should be &#039;ok&#039; about once a month if you stick to a healthy nutritious diet and keep physically active. 3 months or more and you&#039;ll almost always hit the sweet spot. This can also depend on how big of a dosage you plan to take but i usually stick to 100-150mg at the very most.<br /><br />Also listen to your body. If your last roll felt &#039;off&#039; for any reason, increased nausea/headaches that sort of thing during or after your roll then perhaps consider cutting back a bit more, imo.

				I&#039;ve been told that if you roll heavy the optimal time is about 4-6 months. Im sure you can do it sooner but I&#039;m playing safe and I&#039;ll wait for the &quot;BETTER&quot; roll lol!
