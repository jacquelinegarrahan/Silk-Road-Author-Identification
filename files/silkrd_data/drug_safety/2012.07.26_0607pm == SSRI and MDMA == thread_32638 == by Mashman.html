				Yer so I was on SSRI&#039;s from sept 11 to jan 12.<br />&nbsp;I understand that whilst on anti d&#039;s dropping MD will do basically nothing.<br />So about a month ago I go out clubbing and eat basically a half gram of MD. It was barely noticeable.<br />Anyone know why this might be? Will I be able to get the high back again? If not I&#039;m going to have to resort to dancing like a knob on ket whenever I go out!

				Short and sweet version. Depending on the type of ssri you will need to abstain for at least 45 days. The ssri binds to receptors mdma would bind to. You also ran a real risk of seratonine syndrome...

				From my experience with lexapro/celexa it totally killed my roll from a really strong big lady g pill.<br /><br />As the drugs take a long time to build up in your body to start working, it will take a while for it to leave the body fully till you can start rolling hard again.

				It depends on the half life of the SSRI, in addition to the more nuanced discussion regarding long-term effects of SSRI&#039;s on 5-ht receptors.&nbsp; I have heard anecdotal reports that long term (multi-year) use of AD&#039;s may eliminate your ability to roll indefinitely.&nbsp; That shouldn&#039;t be a problem really in your case, but I would wait at least another month or so before trying again.&nbsp; Seven months since you discontinued should really be enough though...may I ask the name of the SSRI?&nbsp; I only ask cause I was on sertraline (zoloft) for just a month and a half, tapered down, waited a week or so, and proceeded to roll my balls off :D<br /><br />Best of luck mang.
