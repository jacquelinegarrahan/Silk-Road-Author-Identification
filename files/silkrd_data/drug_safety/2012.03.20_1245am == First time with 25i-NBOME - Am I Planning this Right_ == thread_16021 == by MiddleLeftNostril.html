				Previous Drug Use<br />Cannabis: At least once a week, usually more<br />Alcohol:&nbsp; Once a month<br />LSD: 1 weak tab a month ago (it made me interested in going here, because I didn&#039;t want to deal with street dealers anymore lol)<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to buy from Etizolam 60mg of 25i-NBOME powder (I placed an order incorrectly a week ago and it never got shipped, not his fault at all though; hopefully he sees this so he knows why I cancelled it) and measure it out, measure how many mL of isopropyl alcohol my blotter tabs can hold, and then dissolve the 25i-NBOME so that I get 500ug per tab.<br /><br />How does this sound?&nbsp; Can I take it sublingually and get all the effects or is HPBCD complexing necessary for sublingually taking 25i and getting the most from the powder?&nbsp; If 70% isopropyl alcohol is all that I can find, would it be good enough?<br /><br />EDIT: http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94953<br />What happened here?&nbsp; I know the drug causes vasoconstriction but this experience is weird.

				imo...I took some ;&#039;) LSD over the past 20years, but never tried any NBOME yet...<br />why don&#039;t you just leave the NBOME alone for now and get more experienced with the real stuff...try acid in higher doses, maybe some 2c-b before using these new RC&#039;s.<br />Get used to the real Cid and then experiment with others....<br /><br />as I said IMO....<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace<br />BockZu

				I would do more LSD, but after reading about 25i-NBOME, it looked like it has the exact same effects as LSD except for some vasoconstriction at higher doses, and I could afford to buy more 25i than acid.&nbsp; <br /><br />I definitely want to do good acid in the future, but 2c-b looks good, too.&nbsp; I just want to make sure I&#039;m making safe, even, active blotters of 25i, though.

				It&#039;s not like acid.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s similar, but you couldn&#039;t trick somebody who&#039;s familiar with acid into thinking it was acid.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth a try.&nbsp; Especially in this acid drought.&nbsp; Just giving you a heads up.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take it and think that&#039;s what good acid is like.
