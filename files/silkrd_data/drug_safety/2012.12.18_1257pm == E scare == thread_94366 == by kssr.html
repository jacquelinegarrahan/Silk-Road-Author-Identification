				Hello guys!<br /><br />Rather than using these &quot;swim&quot; and clearnet bullshit websites I&#039;d like some advice from experienced users/buyers of pills.<br /><br />Without giving loads away last week I consumed/snorted 3 or 4 high strength pills (200mg per pill) I know this is a bad thing to do and I should be taking 1-2 max. The next morning I didn&#039;t feel too bad, but I went to toilet, felt a little light headed, than had really sore head, almost felt like waves/throbbing sore, I then started shaking and fell to ground shaking, then managed to get back up, I was then sweating uncontrollably and was in shock as to what actually happened. I think I&#039;ve experienced a severe panic attack. What does the Road community think?<br /><br />Personally I won&#039;t be consuming ANY drugs for a long long time as this experience has actually scarred me for life... with new year and xmas coming I have lovely coke and the best pills on my shelf but I&#039;m genuinely going to give them away.. not for me anymore&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Too much too soon!<br /><br />Get on the wagon for a few months, detox and ease back on when/if you feel up to it!<br /><br />

				Seriously its scared the living shit out me, I know I&#039;ve been careless but I wouldn&#039;t wish this feeling upon anyone. I can&#039;t remember if I was shouting or anything as I was falling just remember hearing a bang and no one was about to see it. I kept looking to see if anyone had seen it as I was in disbelief...<br /><br />Very scary stuff, I think it has been panic attack. I literally couldn&#039;t control my body as I fell to ground and just remember thinking to myself &quot;this is it&quot;. It&#039;s been 3 days now and I still can&#039;t get my head around it, and i&#039;ve been suffering from anxiety thinking about it too.<br /><br />Think some benzo&#039;s might help me in the evenings or should I just stay clean and try the healthy approach to things.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Probably serotonergic syndrome. Wait half a year before taking any dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs just to be safe.

This can be induced by amphetamines and derivatives of it (like MDMA).<br /><br />If you get an severe attack of&nbsp; epilepsy, you can die bro! If a &quot;normal&quot; MDMA-dose would be around 120-150mg, then going for a 600-800mg trip is a really bad idea.<br /><br />You should really ask yourself, WHY you did this? Normally we have an &quot;built in inhibition&quot;, which protect our lives from such a behavior. Take this incident as a motivation to NEVER EVER come back in this situation.<br /><br />Hulk <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think it was peer pressure in all honesty :( I feel like such an idiot for doing it mate, never felt so low in my life.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know it can cause epilepsy too? My symptoms actually match epilepsy now you mention it and I did take a sorta fit, so it could either be that or a panic attack? The spinning/dizzy head was UNBARABLE. I know this sounds daft but could I develop panic attacks/epilepsy due to this one experience. And I take it MDMA epileptic fits are light sensitive? I did get up quickly from bed then felt poorly once I reached other room.<br /><br />Never ever come back? I&#039;m seriously considering quitting all drugs except alcohol in moderation, it&#039;s scared me that much.<br /><br />Thanks for advice tho, anyone else willing to chime in?

				Dry out for a minute, take care of your body antioxidents/ 5htp/ vitamins and shit.&nbsp; You dont have to quit drugs all together, but maybe taking a hiatus would be good (6 mo or so).&nbsp; Whether this is what scares you straight or what is up to you, what you have going on in your life, what you want to do with your life.&nbsp; Drugs can work in a fairly normal lifestyle, but sometimes people take it too far.&nbsp; Theres inherent risks and when you take drugs your taking those risks.&nbsp; Be careful, be safe and just keep it easy for a little, you&#039;ll be alright

With what&#039;s going on with my life it might be for good for me to stop, I normally sell these pills,etc but decide now and again I fancy a shot, but I&#039;ve clearly took it too far this time.<br /><br />I would really like to thank you for your kind words. It took me like 2 days to recover from effects, but emotionally I think this will take a while.

				You took wayyy too much E. You don&#039;t need to lay off drugs, just lay off of stimulant drugs for a while, especially MDMA-like drugs.
