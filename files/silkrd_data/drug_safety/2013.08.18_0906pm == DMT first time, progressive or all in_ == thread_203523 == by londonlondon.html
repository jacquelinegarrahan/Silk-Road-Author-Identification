				Was wondering what could be the best way to enjoy the breakthrough experience.<br />If going all in the first time or if going &#039;progressively&#039; about it until moving to breakthrough?<br />I have mild experience with psychedelics and hard drugs in general.<br />Been reading way too much about it for some time now, very very curious to try it. (would most likely do it alone, would this be highly unadvisable? or is it literally impossible to move while breakthrough?)<br />

				Nobody can say for sure. For someone it would be better to go progressive, for some other to go all at once.<br />It depends on your nature (but you must be true to yourself). Are you usually a coward and/or cannot stand too much change? If that&#039;s so maybe it&#039;s better you go all at once or you will probably never reach a breakthrough because you will block after a while. If instead you are daring and not care about change is better to go progressive so you understand how DMT works in all the subtleties.<br /><br />But, again, this is anyway not set in stone. I think this is an answer only yourself can find.

				I smoked DMT several times, I haven&#039;t broke through yet , I don&#039;t feel mentally ready yet.<br />It&#039;s pretty intense man even without breaking through youll see. Step by step :)

				I have smoked Changa about 10 times usually mixing various amounts in with my weed. I also have not had a breakthrough as of yet but feel I have come close a time or two. Its definitely very intense even if you don&#039;t breakthrough.

Thanks for the thoughtfully expressed comment <br /><br />Thanks to all answers. Each one contributed key points to consider :). <br /><br />After considering what I&#039;ve read, as well as watching &#039;The Spirit Molecule&quot; :P, I believe I will go progressively. At least the first dose. Get a slight feel for it, then head straight upstairs! Waiting on some BCs to get my hands on that beautiful substance. On second thoughts, I won&#039;t leave anything written in concrete. I&#039;ll wait for the moment and see what feels right.<br /><br />

				Whenever I am introducing DMT to a friend I always give them a small dose of 15-20mg and smoke them on that so they can get a feeling of what the body load is like along with mild visuals/fractals. If they enjoy it or want to go further, I tell them exactly what they are going to experience and how it will go down. Then if they&#039;re ready I go right to a 50-60mg dose.<br /><br />Definitely do a small dose first though, there is a huge body component to DMT and you might find it weird if you go right into a breakthrough dose and are seeing multi-colored pyramids and shapes flying at you over a grassy plain while also experiencing a huge body high.<br /><br />Its pleasant, but you might feel a little overwhelmed.

				My first breakthru on DMT was scary as hell. I felt like my brain got partially disconnected or something. Like I had stuck my finger in the electric outlet and couldn&#039;t break out. The scariest thing was that I had forgotten I hit DMT. Hell I forgot everything. It was like being reborn in a different world. Most people do like it but now I&#039;m pussy. It&#039;s gonna be a long while before I hit that shit up again!

				If you decide to up your dosage slightly beware of leftover residue. I used my vape and buffered it with weed for my first time and had a jaw dropping experience. 15 mins later I went to smoke the rest of my weed in the vape and got my ass handed to me unlike any other psychedelic. Make sure your in the right frame of mind because the experience will probably leave you questioning everything.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				great answers and thanks for all the constructive feedback :)<br /><br />@LeadSingersDisease: can you further elaborate on the questioning everything. If you have a couple of minutes to waste/invest (however you want to see it :) ), I wouldn&#039;t mind reading a paragraph or two about the long-term effect or revealing experience about &#039;reality&#039;.<br /><br />Thanks for all answers again :)

				It&#039;s a strange feeling and extremely hard to put into words. What I saw when I was coming up was everything around me broken down into fractals and it was as if it where possible to look through the fractals and view the universe. I saw impossible shapes and movements. <br /><br />A friend closed his eyes and said he suddenly understood mathematics(he&#039;s not big on maths...). It&#039;s as if you suddenly understand everything and you see how everything is interconnected and how there&#039;s a whole other world beyond what we perceive then you are slowly brought back into reality and your left trying to comprehend this thing you experienced.<br /><br />It&#039;s just such a bizarre experience that it really is difficult to comprehend the whole thing. Have a read or Karl Jansens : Ketamine Dream &amp; Realities if you want a better description

				damn!! reading these kinds of things makes me want to try it even more lol :P!<br />I think I&#039;m a very open person towards life/reality/alternate realities in general<br />I know there is no way I can be prepared for it, but at least I hope I can get something incredible from the experience<br />I keep wondering how safe is it to do alone? I&#039;ve done 1 LSD tab once, a half dozen 2ci tabs, couple dozen before-k-hole-doses of ket, few benzos, weed. I&#039;m somewhat of a person who likes to take control, but I hope that this experience is so enlightening that for once I can cave in and release full control. It&#039;s one of my hopes to try DMT. I somehow feel I always try to control some aspect of something. I want to start relieving my ego and start living with less control (hopefully someone understand what I mean). Not about going all wild, I actually do go &#039;wild&#039; to some degree, get drunk get high, some wild nights. But not this type of releasing control. Just having &#039;general&#039; control of something, release my consciousness, my &#039;soul&#039;, the energy that controls my body, and let it wonder, away from its vessel. I guess I kind of deviated from topic, as I am hereby responsible for being drunk/high/tired, but I just hope I can get a lot from DMT. And wonder if, even though im a ocntrol type person, is it safe to do alone? (hiding &#039;dangerous&#039; objects obviously)

				Breakthrough can be an absolutely terrifying experience for even the most prepared.<br />Keep in mind that you will open up doors that you cannot close once you have a true &quot;breakthrough&quot; trip.<br />I myself, wish I had never had abreakthrough trip, since I was neither mature in age nor spirituality at the time it happened.<br />DMT is some very serious stuff, and I would not touch if you aren&#039;t comfortable with the idea of permanently and severely altering your perception of the world.<br />

				If your an experienced tripper then you should be fine with it but then again it is that powerful. When i done it i vaped on top of some weed. When i went to finish the weed when i came down it didnt dawn on me that there would be any significant amount left... How wrong i was<br /><br />For about 10 minutes i seemed to experience every bit of guilt/anger/confusion directed inwards which shook me up for a few hours but I think it was because I was just thinking this weeds gonna be good and chill me out to put my first trip into perspective then !!BAM!! I&#039;m recursively calling myself a cunt in my head for what feels like forever, through this alien machine. Not nice at all but with psychedelics there&#039;s usually something to take away from the experience.<br /><br />The only other thing i can think of in terms of onset and strength I think only salvia extract(x40+) comes close. DMT feels like salvia&#039;s good brother whereas salvia is the black sheep(although i guess it has it&#039;s place)

				However the approach dosage wise I think. releasing expectations, making the space you use spice in comfortable and spiritually clean and setting an intention to accept whatever the lesson is will help a lot. Dim indirect lighting, tea and somewhere I can sit in lotus. I also now put a large oven pad in my lap so I can just lower my machine in my hands if flying solo. If I do it right just the tip is hot.<br /><br />I like the first low doses and the flat oscillating patterns I saw in CEVs. The blips and bleeps. I agree with starting out there.<br /><br />If you wish share your experience with the vendor and product here. <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0&nbsp; &nbsp;Also some great info in the OP.
