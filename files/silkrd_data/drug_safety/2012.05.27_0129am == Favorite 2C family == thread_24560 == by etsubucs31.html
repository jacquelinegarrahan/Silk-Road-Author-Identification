				Hey all. I&#039;m looking to try out some of the 2C family. Can anybody who&#039;s tried some or all of them comment on their experience? I&#039;m looking for something that isn&#039;t too intense. I know for sure I would like to try 2C-B. It&#039;s the others that I would like to know more about. Specifically C,E, and I. From what I remember 2C-C is somewhat intense and can be a little scary even at smaller doses, but to be honest I get them all confused (besides B). I know everyone has different opinions, but I am still very new to psychedelics and would like to ease my way in.

				I&#039;m gonna quote this post, cuz it definitely has all the info you need. Personally, I&#039;ve had great times on 2c-c and 2c-i, the duration of 2c-i kinda turns me off but it usually produced a great body buzz. 2c-c is generally regarded as fairly mild and was actually my favorite, though fairly underwhelming at times, I did love being back to baseline in about 6 hours. I once tried 2c-c through insufflation and had some of the craziest visuals I&#039;ve ever had, tracers for miles, tons of color, everything melting. I can&#039;t recommend insufflation, it hurts sooo bad and I was insta-peaking, no come up to ease into it. I think you may have c and e confused, e sounds super potent and trip reports and the body buzz scared me off (though I still have a big sack of it just in case, lol)<br />Anyways, imo 2-cb sounds like the winner, fairly mild in the head space and great visuals. Was considering buying some and came across this awesome post that should help you out... <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10752.msg205765#msg205765">Quote from: GreenPEAs on April 24, 2012, 03:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When people talk about the 2C family, they are referring to a class of psychedelics generally called &quot;substituted phenethylamines&quot;. The &quot;2C&quot; comes from the fact that there are &quot;2 carbons&quot; in the &quot;backbone&quot; of the phenethylamine molecule. If you go to Google and look up an image for phenethylamine, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m referring to.<br /><br />Since they all have this similar nomenclature (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-C, etc) it&#039;s a pretty fair assumption most beginners make to assume that they are all very &quot;similar&quot; to one another. In actuality, they can be dramatically different in both effects and potency.<br /><br />As a class of compounds, they can have some negative side effects you may not like - nausea, cramping, headaches, variable duration of come-up, etc. The dosage required for effects is also variable from person to person. Even though you sound like you have a strong opiod tolerance, I wouldn&#039;t expect that to carry over to these compounds. As for the M1 (methylone), that compound has a very different pharmacological mechanism and I wouldn&#039;t expect tolerance to it to carry over either.<br /><br />The 2C family can be pretty seriously psychedelic and if you are just looking for a good time or a fun buzz, it might not be the best choice, but there are certainly a few that may be worth your time. I will give you my recommendations when I get to the descriptions of each in a moment.<br /><br />There are three types of 2C you will find around here and I will break them down according to *my own personal experiences* with them. Your mind may vary and I would advise reading on Erowid &amp; Bluelight extensively before investing in them. I would also recommend that you absolutely do not bother with any of the 2C drugs unless you have a nice milligram scale. Some people manage to get away with eyeballing, but I would never advise it. Even a 5mg difference can totally change the effects.<br /><br />When I discuss these chems, I&#039;m going based on my experiences at &quot;average&quot; doses per Erowid, etc. If you take a very high dose of *any* of them including 2C-C (despite what many will say), you can wind up in a full-blown, reality-destroying, rolling in your own vomit type of mindfuck. At the same time, taking a barely threshold dose can result in nice anti-depressant stimulation, or just a stomach-ache. You&#039;ll have to figure out your own personal dose-response curve on your own, but always start low!<br /><br />One last precaution - I really recommend having a benzodiazepine (Etizolam, Xanax, Valium) and an anti-psychotic (Haldol, Risperidone) around when you try these. I have saved my ass many a time with the anti-psychotics and sometimes you will come down from the trip but be entirely unable to sleep without the benzodiazepine. The benzos are also helpful when someone is having a &quot;rough&quot; trip. Save the antipsychotics for when you are in serious trouble.<br /><br />ALL DOSES GIVEN ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES. DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY AND ALSO QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT, IT MAY VARY. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO START LOW. START LOW. START LOW. INCREASE SLOWLY! IF NOTHING ELSE, REMEMBER THAT PLEASE!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Halogenated 2C-x<br />In my experience, these are generally gentler and more &quot;fun&quot; than the alkylated or thiolated 2Cs we will discuss next. These are the closest to psychedelic candy that you will find in this family. The &quot;halogen&quot; refers to the bromine, chlorine, or iodine atom that is placed on the phenethylamine ring.<br /><br />2C-C - least potent by dose, mellow, minimal mind-fuck, &quot;sparkly&quot; visuals.&nbsp; (Dose: ~30-45mg)<br />2C-B - best body high for me, interesting mind-space, can be very euphoric and recreational at 15-20mg, a true-blue psych at higher doses. (Dose: ~15-30mg)<br />2C-I - longest duration of halogens, crazy &quot;beams&quot; of light I do not get on any other 2C, very stimulating, headspace clear until higher doses. (Dose: ~7-20mg)<br /><br />All three of these combine well with many other drugs. I have found 2C-C and 2C-B to go very well with mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, LSD, MDMA, and weed. 2C-I is very popular but I suspect that has more to do with availability than anything else. I prefer 2C-B over 2C-I because the duration is shorter, the body-high is better (for me), and the headspace is more &quot;fun&quot;. Also, as the man who invented 2C-B said: &quot;Wherever you are with 2C-B, just hold on tight, in another hour you will be back to somewhere recognizable&quot; (paraphrased). 2C-C is a great compound - it has a fantastic headspace and very interesting visuals, but I feel somewhat mellow / relaxed and also do not get the interesting tactile sensations on it that I do from 2C-B.<br /><br />My recommendation for halogenated 2C-x: 2C-B. Whether it is the HCl or HBr salt, it is a great product. Look for anyone trusted on SR selling it and make sure it is whitish - you don&#039;t want anything brown or yellow - that means it wasn&#039;t washed very well. <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Alkylated 2C-x<br /><br />These are 2C-x chemicals where instead of a halogen (bromine, chlorine, iodine) you have a carbon or carbon chain attached to the phenethylamine ring. With the exception of 2C-D, I find these to be much more &quot;serious&quot; than the halogenated phenethylamines. There are really only three that you are going to see around here.<br /><br />2C-D: Least potent, most forgiving, made me feel somewhat drunk or stoned, visuals were nothing unique until higher doses. (Dose: 35-75mg)<br />2C-E: Most popular, can be rough on body, serious visuals. Can be wildly euphoric and manic or very dark. A true psychedelic in every way. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br />2C-P: Absolutely brutal for me. Jittery and hard on my body, mind absolutely destroyed, duration &quot;infinite&quot;. (Dose: 3-12mg)<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend 2C-P to anyone. True psychonauts will seek it out on their own, but it&#039;s not my thing and I think it is too long and too rough for most people. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it unless you build your way up to it with other psychs first. 2C-D is very rare and some people really love it. I was not too impressed by it but it was forgiving and pleasant enough that I will definitely continue to return to it. 2C-E is bar none the &quot;winner&quot; when it comes to these three but I can only recommend it with the caveat that you absolutely start low with the dose. <br /><br />My recommendation for alkylated 2C-x: 2C-E. For some people, this is very recreational. All I will say is that in my experience, it has not been. I also feel no desire to go back to it, but I&#039;m glad I have tried it. I would recommend that you try it at home first and see how you react. It can be very beautiful visually but the body load was too much for me. You will be hard pressed to find a 2C-x that is more legendary or popular though.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thiolated 2C-x<br /><br />These all have a sulfur atom attached to the phenethylamine ring. There are lots of reports out there that indicate wildly varying dose-response curves and durations amongst individuals and I have found this to be very true in my own experience. The same dose of 2C-T-2 that barely affected me put my old girlfriend into outerspace for 8 hours. The duration tends to be longer and the mental effects more serious than the halogenated 2C compounds, but the visuals are wild for me. Again, you&#039;ll probably only see three of these.<br /><br />2C-T-2: My personal favorite but only due to circumstances that occurred while using it. Some GI distress but wild beams of light and fractal patterning, &quot;neutral&quot; and analytical headspace, somewhat dissociating for me. (Dose: 7-25mg)<br />2C-T-4: Only one I have not tried. Read some trip reports - duration is very long. Rare, does not seem to have enjoyable effects profile for most.<br />2C-T-7: Legendary, feels to me like a longer lasting, more visual, more euphoric 2C-T-2. I was far less lucid or coherent but had a much more enjoyable body buzz. Some trembling, tension, and cramping. Lasted much longer than DOC for me. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br /><br />If you find yourself enjoying 2C-E, these will probably be right up your alley. My experiences with T-2 and T-7 are similar to mine with 2C-E in that I&#039;m glad I had them, I can see the appeal and I enjoyed the ride, but I don&#039;t feel particularly compelled to return to them.<br /><br />My recommendation for thiolated 2C-x: 2C-T-2. The thiolated 2C-x compounds are a bit notorious due to the deaths from T-7 and T-21. This is generally regarded to be due to MAO-I (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) activity, so they shouldn&#039;t be combined with medication or other drugs although some still do so.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now, this is a totally shitty guide I have written for you here. Many will have DRAMATICALLY different opinions of these chems and doses. I hope that this at least gives you a ballpark idea of where to start. I personally recommend that you begin with 2C-B. Get a small amount, try a 15mg dose. See where it takes you. Wait a week and try a 20mg dose. Titrate up in a similar manner until you find what you&#039;re looking for. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, by all means explore the rest of the family, but just keep in mind the experience is different every time, every chem.<br /><br />I would recommend personally that you find a good LSD vendor (read reviews and make sure they aren&#039;t selling 25I-NBOMe or DOx on blotter) or a good source for 4-AcO-DMT / mushrooms and try those as well. <br /><br />Please don&#039;t look to anything I&#039;ve said as being textbook or authoritative - read up at Bluelight and Erowid. <br /><br />In any case, I hope you find what you are looking for.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				That previous post does a good job summing up the 2c family.<br />!<br />Ive done B,E, and I<br /><br />2cb physically feels similar to eating clean mdma and mentally feels like eating clean, chill feeling acid like some swiss...good visuals almost soothing/calming feeling but not lethargic. Good visuals, patterns and breathing for me no colors. I recommend a dose between 12-25mg. Start small.<br /><br />2ci is more of a mind fuck than B. Also more stimulating i cant seem to sit still and feel like i just cant stop thinking...not exactly mind racing like coke but the ideas keeping coming and coming. Pretty visual, though the least visual of the 3 ive tried. My sweet spot is about 18mg. Unlike 2cb the I gives me mostly weird color visuals not patterns.<br /><br />In my experience 2ce is the strongest of the 3 ive tried. The body load is rough and so is the come up, especially if you snort it. Be ready to shit and puke if you rail 20mg....its not fun for a little but after you get over the hump its crazy. Id recommend oral for all 2cs and to start small. E gets me couch locked, introspective, and lost in crazy visuals.<br /><br /><br />2cb for me is without a doubt the least rough on the body and mind and without a doubt the most fun of the 2c3 family. I suggest starting there.

				Thanks for the info guys. It definitely seems like B is the best to start out with. I am extremely interested in psychs, but a little scared as my first experience (shrooms) went horribly wrong (my fault, too high dose and bad setting). Since then I have tried shrooms again at a lower dose and has a much better experience. I know psychs aren&#039;t for some people, but after hearing other people&#039;s experiences they are so interesting and I feel like it should be for me. Anyways, hopefully I can ease my way into the psych world and have positive experiences!

				2c-c is the easiest psychedelic to take and I highly recommend it to those completely new to tripping. It&#039;s very forgiving of high doses and will be a light and mellow experience. There is often no body load and will make you feel mellow and relaxed. Be sure to have some nice music in the background. Instrumentals are amazing with this one. Visuals are slightly melty and mostly blendy. <br /><br />2c-b is known as the bodily one and 99% of the people who take it end up with tactile enhancement similar to mdma. I am the 1% and ended up with strange visuals and no body high. But try to take this with someone you would like to get bodily with. If you&#039;re like me you might experience a lot of melty and swirly kaleidoscope visuals in which you&#039;ll end up gazing into the most colorful still image available. <br /><br />2c-i is infused with some happy and gives me a very nice body high. This one also enhances my sense of taste; I highly recommend exploring a handful of skittles during peak ... others have recommended popsicles, jolly ranchers, and jelly beans. Everything looks interesting and I find myself becoming absorbed in the little details while finding joy in them. Lights are pretty cool ... one would probably have fun with a glow stick or a flashlight. CEV&#039;s are very fractal and electric. <br /><br />To ease your way in, start with 2c-c, then 2c-b, then 2c-i.

				I&#039;m also interested in learning about the 2C family. That post did a nice job clearing some things up. +1 for that.<br /><br />I do want to know about the change in effects from 2c-x NBOME. Anyone got experience there?<br />
