				So with synthetic cannabinoids what would be the easiest way to smoke them since its such a small amount ( 1-10mg)<br />Thinking of making an order for a gram of synthetic cannabinoids , also any one have preference on the which ones to get jwh-019 /jwh 210 etc <br />Regards Garlow

				measure out your amount, put it into alcohol, get some dried herbs, mix them together, let the alcohol evaporate, dry the herbs and smoke those. <br />

				I personally preferred jwh-018. I swear it felt exactly like pure THC.

				The alcohol method described above has various flaws.<br /><br />First off, JWH compounds are much more soluble in acetone than in alcohol, so you should use acetone. This way, you have less liquid which is easier to spray on your herbs. Also, acetone evaporates much quicker, so you won&#039;t have to wait as long for it to dry.<br /><br />But i would recommend not smoking this stuff at all, instead vaporize it. Smoking, in my experience, requires higher doses to have the same effect, the effects last shorter and it is also unhealthy.<br /><br />You can use a lightbulb vaporizer (google it) to vaporize the powder. Alternatively, you can also vaporize it with a meth/crack pipe or eagle bill shake n&#039; vape or similar vaporizing apparatus. Not only is this healthier and more economical (smaller doses required, no need to buy solvents and herbs) but less time consuming and more practical as it does not produce any smell.

				^^ the vaping method is the best/most economical<br /><br />My favorite was the silly cigs!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Measure out dosage, place in the tip of a cigarette and light that shit...First hit is the one with the chemical...&nbsp; Found this worked better with stronger cannabinoids such as am-2201 and not so great with say jwh-122 were a dose is high mg......<br /><br />

				I just dip a cig in the bag of jwh-018 and smoke it. To hide them in a pack, put a lighter to the top of the cig, melting the powder and not catching the cig on fire. It will melt right in. Its a perfect way to get high and have nobody around you know. I used to bring a few to the casino with me.

				My preferred tool is an electric filament pen. a medical tool for cauterizing wounds. basically just a hot nichrome wire. I get the wire a little hot with a couple of taps...touch it to the powder.. tapping the power will let you gently melt some powder into a pool or bead. higher power and the melt will vaporize...let it get too hot and it will catch fire. it doesnt take much practice to get it down. <br /><br />basically this lets you &quot;chase the dragon&quot; I like to use a silicone tube to suck up the vapor. Over time some of the vapor condenses inside the tube. You can cut the tube open and collect it once it builds up a bit. <br /><br />it probably sounds silly but you can also take a long section of tube and coil it in a sports bottle filled with ice water. This lets you exhale through the cooled tube condensing any JWH that your lungs pass so you can &quot;recycle&quot; your waste. LOL<br /><br />If you are retardedly paranoid about knowing your dosage you can gently melt your stash into a single wax like lump. and set it on a submg digital scale while smoking.
