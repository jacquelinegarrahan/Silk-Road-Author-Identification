				Hey all.<br /><br />Bit more to it than the title suggests. I&#039;m 31, have a fair bit of experience of psychedelics &amp; used to be a filthy bin for mdma between the ages of 16 &amp; 25.<br /><br />I&#039;ve suffered from pretty grim depression on &amp; off my whole life &amp; been on SSRI&#039;s for the last two years. (citalopram/celexa up to 60mg &amp; venlafaxine/effexore at 225mg) They help in so much as I don&#039;t want to do myself in most mornings but thats pretty much it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 300g or so of powdered mimosa &amp; 100g of shredded caapi to play with &amp; would really like to go for a transformative experience, i&#039;ve not taken my ADs the last couple of days in preparation &amp; would appreciate it if anyone could offer any advice as to how to go about preparing a brew, as there seems not to be alot of consensus about amounts of materials to use etc elsewhere on the web.

				You will need to stay off your antidepressant medication for more than just a few days. Also, never stop cold turkey. You are putting yourself at an increased risk of relapse. The longer you have been on these meds, the more harsh the withdrawal can be. Effexor is associated with some of the worst withdrawal symptoms because they clear out of your system quickly, leaving little time for your body to adjust to the sudden drop in the neurotransmitter serotonin. <br /><br />If you still wish to try and make a DMT/ayahuasca brew, BuddhaNature posted a tutorial back in August.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35649.0<br /><br />sdesu

				Cheers for the reply Sdesu &amp; I understand your concerns.<br /><br />Can see how what I&#039;m doing could seem pretty reckless on the face of it but I know where I am with venlafaxine &amp; its half life. Going cold turkey isn&#039;t any fun, but from bitter experience I can say for me it&#039;s preferable to several weeks of low level unpleasantness tapering off &amp; then still having withdrawal effects 2/3 or so as severe as just stopping. <br /><br />Had a look at BuddhaNature&#039;s thread that you linked, was looking help preparing a drinky rather than an extraction tech,. I&#039;ve extracted &amp; used smoked DMT a fair bit (used it with vaped harmalas my mate extracted as well)

				60 mg of citalopram is not something to quite overnight at all.&nbsp; Its a pretty high dose to begin with, and stopping its use would certainly require tapering off over the course of several weeks or months.
