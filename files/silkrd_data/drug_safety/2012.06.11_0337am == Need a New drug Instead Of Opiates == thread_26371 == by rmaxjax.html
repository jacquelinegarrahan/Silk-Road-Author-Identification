				Hey guys, I love Opiates I&#039;ve been prescribed them for awhile, but since I love the euphoria I usually run out of my script early, and it sucks!<br />I&#039;m looking for a new drug First I want one that is similar to Opiates My favorite being Roxicodone and old Opanas <br />I loved the Sense of pure happiness you have when on them also the ease to have conversations, feel empathetic and just feel good, while still being able to act &quot;normal&quot; <br /><br />What are some other options I could Try?

				MDMA&#039;s awesome in terms of euphoria, but you won&#039;t find yourself as easy going as you would on opiates. Though I&#039;ve never tried it, I&#039;ve heard Kratom to be an excellent replacement for opiates.

				MDMA every so often for sure. I enjoy diazepam for every day use, it&#039;s a nice high and it&#039;s easy to appear normal on it if need be...don&#039;t recommend it but i&#039;m sure you know the risks of taking any addictive drug daily.

				Realistically it would be hard to find any substitute for opiates. <br /><br />It would probably best to discuss the situation with the doctor that prescribed you these opiates in the first place. He should be familiar with patients that grow addicted to the medication and the best ways to deal with such addiction.<br /><br />Obviously i have no problem with recreational use, but if a physician prescribed medication is causing you problems, you should really revisit that physician to mend them as well.

				I found opiates the most sly drugs at getting you addicted. It&#039;s like a comfy pillow you don&#039;t even know you&#039;re falling asleep on.
