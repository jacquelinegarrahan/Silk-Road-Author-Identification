				dont order a full gram of high quality dope because if you do that and dont have a tolerance you wont be able to blow through it in a day and i have the feeling you will get addicted, but i think you would be fine to get maybe .25g or so.

				I&#039;d advise extreme caution. A single dose of 10 mg morphine can take you from agony to bliss after surgery. Heroin is probably stronger when i comes to it, and more addictive as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have the option, keep opiates as the last resort&nbsp; &nbsp;- there is no stronger medicine afterwards if you need it!

				Just read the H threads and see all the shit these guys go threw on daily basis to get by. I am too lazt to be a smackhead.<br /><br />Myself,&nbsp; H worries me because I cant even help myself with weed, I go in to piggy mode and wont stop smoking every chance I get until all of it is gone. On the other hand I have done shit loads of other hard drugs and walked away from chronic long term use with ease.

				If you want a real answer to this question then Search for the thread &quot;If you are thinking of trying Heroin....&quot; by a member called Raoul Duke. He bought a gram to give it a go and he basically had a narrow escape. <br /><br />Hope this helps.

I loved that movie so much.<br /><br />But, I&#039;ve been down the heroin road as well. It was pretty alright. Never IV&#039;d so I can&#039;t speak for that, but I&#039;ve eaten, snorted, and smoked. It&#039;s been a month since I last had any, but I&#039;ve ordered some more. I don&#039;t really have problems with addiction, personally, and don&#039;t take it more often than I&#039;m comfortable with, but my only complaint is that I&#039;m usually an asshole the day after I take it. I always have to make sure I don&#039;t have anything important planned the next day before I take it. =P

				Since no one&#039;s actually answered your questions:<br /><br />Do&#039;s:<br />-Use a wheel filter. Even if it looks really clear, there are likely things in there that you don&#039;t want in your bloodstream.<br />-Get a good milligram scale so that you can accurately measure how much you&#039;re taking<br />-Start off very small. Start with 5mg, and work up from there. Heroin is (give or take) twice as potent as morphine. A standard medical dose of IV morphine for pain management is 10mg. If you&#039;ve never done opiates (vicodins don&#039;t really count, in my book) then maybe even start off with 2mg, although that&#039;s probably pretty conservative. But better conservative than dead.<br />-Use a new, clean needle each time<br />-Properly prep your injection site. Wash your hands with soap and water, and clean the injection site with alcohol<br />-Follow the 8/72 rule: use for no more than 8 hours at a time, and stay off completely for a minimum of 72 hours afterward<br /><br />Dont&#039;s:<br />-Order a whole gram for your first time. Since your tolerance is likely low, a gram will last a long time, and unless you have amazing self-control, you&#039;ll be more likely to use longer/more than you should.<br />-Assume all H you order is the same strength. Test each and every batch you get with a small amount so that you can gauge how strong it is before you take the amount you usually do to get where you want.<br />-Combine with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, etc...) until you&#039;re used to how it effects your body alone. Better not to combine at all, but definitely not till you&#039;re comfortable with what it does to your body.<br /><br />Be prepared for:<br />-Never wanting to do any opiate any route but IV. It feels so much better, you&#039;ll never want to go back<br />-Severe nausea the first few times. If this happens, lie on your back and take slow, deep breaths. This should help. Also try eating some ginger, or making some ginger tea (from fresh root). It helps me out quite a bit.<br />-An urge to do IV opiates that never really goes away. Even if you&#039;re not addicted, or even close, there&#039;s always that small, nagging feeling that tells you it would be so nice if you could IV some opiates.
