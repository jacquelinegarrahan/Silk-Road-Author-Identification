				I have snorted street cocaine quite a few times. But I don&#039;t even know if it could be classed as cocaine. Cheap, cut... shit. So shit I&#039;ve seen me halving a gram and snorting half a gram in one line and feeling nothing much from it sometimes.<br /><br />So, I&#039;ll pretty much class myself as new to (proper) cocaine. And now I&#039;ve decided to buy some proper cocaine off the Road and give it a go with my friends! The cocaine I&#039;m planning to buy is as follows:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0c6a62f019<br /><br />However, as I am new to cocaine what would be a good starting dosage to snort for my first time (I weigh around 150 pounds) to experience the proper effects but not get too out of it on my first proper time on cocaine? Also, do you think I wouldn&#039;t be taking too much of a risk to just judge my dosage by eye if I was pretty careful? (I do have scales, but I don&#039;t plan to bring them with me... And my scales are shit cheap ones and only measure to 0.1g.)<br /><br />Also if anyone has any good tips or ideas or any useful information to a cocaine newbie - please reply.<br /><br />Thank you!

				Here&#039;s my experience first time I tried the &#039;caine. <br /><br />Called friend who could hook it up. I to my knowledge back then didn&#039;t know how much to ask for when they asked how much I wanted. I only knew about Blow and my parent&#039;s with their Crack addiction. So I said kilos. I was laughed at. Woe is me. Moving along. We ended up getting (wait, by we I mean my girlfriend at the time) a gram. All of our friends went out clubbing and we stayed behind to rail it. I was nervous as fuck. She had experience before so I was a little weary. I even thought that I&#039;d look stupid figuring out how to snort (it was much like smoking weed my first time using a pipe. Ha.) We made out two decent lines each, I let her go first making myself look like a &quot;gentleman&quot;. I watched her and mimicked her exactly. I instantly loved the tasted but everything went numb immediately. Tongue, throat, teeth, mouth and I was for sure awake. This was street coke by the way in the South. Shit stuff but back then... damn. Now all I know of is what I have seen int he movies and tv, when you snort you are horny as fuck and you are so wired. Now I think it&#039;s because what I have saw from everyone else and heard shit I was just acting from what I have &quot;known&quot;. Now she made me turned on as hell sober so when she snorted she was even more with me. I suppose what I am trying to say is, I use a lot actions based of what I have already saw/heard. So back then the coke was probably shit and heavily cut with amps. But it didn&#039;t stop us from fucking to the end of no tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />hello, let me introduce myself, I&#039;m an idiot and have a death wish therefore, I (used) to take whatever made me escape.<br /><br />But now, just be careful. and I probably helped you in no way yet for an entertained story!

				My favourite thing about the quality of cola on the road -&nbsp; it turns my girlfriend into a fiend for deepthroat.<br />I know it doesnt really answer your original question.......<br /><br /><br /><br />But I do enjoy telling people :-)

				First time I did some coke it felt like I was superman. Running through brick walls and all. I remember doing a kegstand at a party and staying up for an ungodly amount of time (I know, badass....). Anyways, I ended up fucking the nastiest bitch at my college. Woke up the next morning and vomitted when I saw who I was in bed with. I continued to do coke until my senior year of college and finally gave it up bc I kind of lost the euphoric aspect. These days, I can turn down a line like it&#039;s no big deal.

				doing really good coke makes me want to talk dance and fuck all night if i can control the alcohol, if im on a mission of destruction, the disgusting egoboost and swagger can lead to many punchy moments. there&#039;s always a fine line. an although the honeymoon period of your first few experiences are always good fun, its when your used to it and the initial buzz wears off that it starts sucking. finding the purest stuff becomes a chore; thats the time for something new...<br /><br />MDMA!!

				I&#039;m probably the worst guy to give you advice on coke but lest just say this, about 7rs ago where i lived on of my friends was getting amazing shit that I&#039;ve never seen since, the problem i have with even the best coke is i never felt like i got there (meaning a perfect high) and i always felt like I was chasing to see if i could get higher which i never had with meth, ecstasy or benzo&#039;s. then all the shit in my area went to crap and now everything they&#039;re calling coke has been stepped on by everyone&#039;s grandmother so its literally like paying for depression now. plus every drug treats everyone differently even the best shit made me crash the next day so bad i had to drink a bottle of johnny walker just to avoid the pain so i&#039;ll never touch it again, but other people love it and its their favorite weapon of choice, so if your into having to bump every half hour to keep your high and deal with all the cons that go in with coke that&#039;s totally up to you but i would definitely not go plunging in full steem without taking some time to weigh the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s as with any drug.

				honestly though, coke EVERYWHERE (here included) is not what its used to be. simple as that<br /><br />and its a sad..sad thing<br /><br />im talking...going through easily over $1000 and getting an occasional rush..but its all bullshit...its like all we do is analyze which one is like 5% more pure than the last batch...but still its all cut and under 60%...so meh. id rather do something else

				I couldn&#039;t agree with Stinkafinger more, my budyy was selling 50 sacks that would keep you going for 3-4hrs with half the depressing comedown the powedered sugar they pass off as coke these days, I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t some SR Vendors that sell some quality material but it just got so expensive having to buy 8 balls for 4 guys to afterparty after the bars, back when i did that sort of shit. I really hope they are some good vendors on here that can offer some people who are interested in trying it some good product to make and educated decision on but me myself that stuff even some of the best just left me depressed with an empty wallet and a nice size dent in my atm balance the next day. so be careful and make sure you do your homework and ask some of the vets who get this sit regularly who to go through because the cats on the streets and at the clubs and party&#039;s are all a bunch of rip off artists IMO.

				I&#039;ve definitely had some great quality on SR, but you have to know where to look. And sometimes, searching for&nbsp; the best results in you buying some bullshit from time to time. I remember buying a half gram one time, doing it all in 15 minutes, and not feeling a thing beyond a numb mouth.<br /><br />Oh the other hand, i&#039;ve had stuff where I can take a 50mg bump and be solid for 40 minutes.<br /><br />So it all depends on who you get it from.<br /><br />I like DRPVMD a lot right now. I&#039;m good with TambourineMan as well. I&#039;ve heard some of the european vendors are selling some solid yayo. But I don&#039;t like dealing with Europe and yay. <br /><br />Presently going to try out some new USA vendors and see what else is out there.<br /><br />Good luck with your search, and when you get some powder, just start off with a small line and give it ten minutes. If you don&#039;t feel anything, try another line.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get the feel for it. Coke is very forgiving as long as you don&#039;t go scar face nuts with the shit on your first try.
