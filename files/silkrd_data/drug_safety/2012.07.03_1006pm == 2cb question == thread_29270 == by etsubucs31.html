				On Saturday night I did 2c-b for the first time after coming down for ecstasy. It extended my roll, but I didn&#039;t get any visuals. Since I&#039;m off work tomorrow I thought it would be fun to do it again tonight by itself. Will 3 days be enough recovery time to have a proper experience? Also is there any neurotoxic issues with taking 2c-b too often? Thanks for any help!

				You should wait a bit to recover from the ecstasy rather than the 2c-b so you can enjoy the full experience. I would wait a minimum of a week but a month is always recommended although most people don&#039;t have the patience for that&nbsp; ;) Take multivitamins everyday to help you recover &quot;faster&quot; so to speak and remember you should dose at least 20mg with 2c-b, anything below just won&#039;t give you an experience other than euphoria type feelings.

Tonight would have been perfect! But I would rather wait the proper time and have a good experience.
