				Someone irl tried to tell me he could get me 1/2g for 50 and 1g for 100, shards not shake/n/bake.&nbsp; That sounded awfully high especially for f2f.&nbsp; What does Meth (good meth) normally go for irl on the south west coast for say, 1/2 gram, 1gram, and 8 balls?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve seen coke cooked up for crack.&nbsp; In the melting process&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen coke have a snot yellowish color while other coke was basically clear and it looked like water after it was heated.&nbsp; It seemed the yellowish color was stronger than the clear.&nbsp; What does the yellowish color mean?&nbsp; I was under the impression coke is clear/white naturally?&nbsp; Is this &quot;yellowish coke more adulterated? <br /><br />Thanks:)<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t answer your question about cocaine, but I can tell you those meth prices are spot-on. I get meth around here for $100 per gram, $50 for half gram, but my dealer always takes some out for herself too cause she&#039;s a fucking cocksucking bitch.

				That&#039;s way too high for coke, but it&#039;s pretty low for meth if you&#039;re only buying 1/2 a g. $100 a gram is what prices were in like 1995, and I think some tweaker&#039;s minds didn&#039;t grow past that date, because there are many that think that&#039;s today&#039;s price. <br /><br />I have found that even when someone says I&#039;m getting $100 a g, I&#039;m not. They either short me, or just put a bunch of nasty cut into the stuff. I would rather pay for the stuff and have it be pure.

The more crap in it, the more yellow it will be.

				I have never seen clear coke, but yellow tinge could be because it was the from the outer layer of the brick which tends to be discolored sometimes.<br /><br />Maybe when you saw yellow coke it was actually good crack and was yellow.<br /><br />

				It could also be that the coke is cut with amphetamine.

				In my old days of rocking up my own in the 90s, every once in awhile you would get a batch that would rock up oily yellow looking. Sometimes it would seem sticky and would take a lot of cooling wiht ice water to get it to set up or form any real crystals.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember one guy calling it his cocamine. That shit would burn the crap out fo your nose when snorted. While that burn would get numbed out it took its toll quickly and left your sinus dry. It smoked strong as hell though so all the crackheads loved it.&nbsp; I have since realized that was simply re rocked by a seller after cutting with meth.&nbsp; I had a friend who swore he had the secret of how to do this in the microwave so all his customers never thought their shit was cut. that stuff made your heart pound and the sweat pop out if you did enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;This could be what you are seeing.&nbsp; The best cola usually rocks clearish to white crystal after the cooling. It has been quite sometime since I played with that wonderful feeling evil<br /><br />To be honest it could have been amphetamine and as I know more about the chemistry the free base of either is an oily substance not a solid. That is why shards or ICE are recrystallized meth HCL<br /><br />Hilly
