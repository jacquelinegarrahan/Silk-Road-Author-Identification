				so the story is, i work at a retail store, and a customer that i have become friends with, he is 79 years old, after watching his 4 brothers all die suffering, he does not want to go through that, so&nbsp; the topic came up and he said he was serious about overdosing when things get bad and he starts to suffer. So what is the best way to&nbsp; over dose. What drug, or drugs combined. Also it has to be a sure fire thing because if all it does is give him siesures, and or make him disabled, etc....&nbsp; Also is this illegal on my part that i am helpiing him, and if so how far can i go in assisting him, can i just tell him what he needs to take, or if i give him the drugs, can i end up in trouble?

				If you&#039;re in the US, yes, you can be arrested for murder. Dr. Kavorkian tried assisted suicides and got shut down. <br /><br />You work in retail and want to help a customer OD? I&#039;ve heard of great customer service, but this takes the cake.

				Overdosing on most prescriptions and stuff is normally pretty bad a lot of pain before things like liver failure. Hours or days in the hospital just rmenising on your life while ur in a complete helplessness. Doesn&#039;t sound like my idea of fun.<br /><br />I know you really don&#039;t want to be that involved in assisted suicide but an overdoseon ghb/alchohol mix woukd be a good way and just look like alchohol poisoning in most cases. Pretty painless becausr you he will be uncioncious.<br /><br />Pottasium cyanide is avalible on sr if he really wants to kill himself painlessly. <br /><br />Just some thoughts<br />

				I&#039;d say a large dose of GHB and alcohol is probably his best bet.

				A high dose of benzo&#039;s and a large amount of GHB (50grams+) would result in a quick painless death.<br /><br />That said you should stay the fuck away from this situation. If he wants to end his life, that is his prerogative. If you are implicated or beloved to be involved in any way by the police (even if you only provide advice) you could be looking at spending the majority of your life in prison.

Upside it that it actually is effective and quick, compared to taking a 100 tablets of benzo&#039;s that will not kill you in most cases.<br /><br />I suppose the nicest way to do it would be carbon monoxide poisoning in your sleep. There are various ways of achieving that, but i&#039;ll leave that to your own imagination. Just one hint: modern cars have very little CO in their exhaust, so do not try that.<br />

				I&#039;ve heard of simple helium bag systems that they use for euthanasia. Look it up, I think Kevorkian has a new DIY method that uses the same system.

				As an individual who had a few years of life full of constant suicidal ideation, I discovered that Darvon/Darvocet is apparently the most peaceful OD for dying.
