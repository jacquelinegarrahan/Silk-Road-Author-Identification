				Both shrooms and LSD can provide stimulation (obviously not on par with MDMA), it just depends on how you handle/trip on the drug and your dosage.

				If you&#039;re not aversive to combining, I&#039;ve found MDMA and shrooms to be quite enjoyable.&nbsp; Use a considerable amount less of each, but its a fun ride.&nbsp; ;)

				LSD + MDMA is the way to go, wouldn&#039;t necessarily recommend it if you haven&#039;t done these two on their own, but if you feel you can handle it go for it just don&#039;t dose it too high 8)&nbsp;
