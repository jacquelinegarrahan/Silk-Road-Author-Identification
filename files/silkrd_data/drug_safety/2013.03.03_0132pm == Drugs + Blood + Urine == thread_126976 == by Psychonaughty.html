				I am wondering how long drugs stay in your system for detection.<br /><br />Weed 4-6 weeks. <br />Acid: just a few hours or maybe even less.<br />Fentanyl?<br />GHB?<br />GBL?<br />Alcohol 8 hours?<br /><br />I know that there are qualitative and quantitative tests. And that there are even tests out there that can measure which substance you used at what point in time. (For example: 10mg diazepam 1.5 days ago at 3pm). But ofcourse these are so expensive that they will&nbsp; not be used a lot.<br /><br />I think clinics will use urine to check for drugs and blood for healthyness?<br />I&#039;ve tried finding some really working stuff about cleaning piss, but couldnt find anything. Adding chloride (or something) will be very obvious between professional people who already expect this.<br /><br />There are probably threads about this. But they have too many pages and I have way too little time.<br /><br />Oh, one question though: Is delivering somebody else&#039;s piss not the best option? Or will they detect that it&#039;s not yours? If they can, how are they able to do this?<br /><br />If somebody wants to take the time giving some answers, thanks in advance :)

				I&#039;m tested @ least once yearly for work. If you aren&#039;t on parole/probation, they can&#039;t watch you piss, if that is the case then switch for someone elses urine.<br />get 2 clean 3 ounce airplane bottles from your local drugstore and some &quot;hot-hands&quot; little bags of iron sulphite that warm up when exposed to air.fill the bottles with clean piss and place the hot hands around the bottles with rubberbands or tape to keep in place. I put them in a ziplockbaggie and duct tape it below my knee and wear baggy pants. They make me empty my pockets outside the room. Once in there, quietly remove&nbsp; bottles dump into container and replace bottles in ziplock, be sure to leave nothing in the room. Done deal. If you are on Paper that&#039;s another story all together.<br />&nbsp;By the way there are almost no chemicals that stay in your system for more than 7 days except THC. Coke, heroin, meth... all out in 3 to 5 days.

				I read something somewhere about using an oxidizing bleach powder to reduce the narcotic chemicals in one&#039;s urine. The method proposed was storing some strong oxidizing bleach powder under a couple of one&#039;s nails and passing the stream of urine over them whilst giving the sample. Supposedly the powder reduces (by oxidation) the chemicals in the urine into undetectable ones.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not a trained chemist, but as far as I understand reduction by oxidation is one of the most common and universal chemical practices, so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this method actually works. Would any of the more chemistry-savvy people on here care to chime-in with their opinions on this matter? :)<br />- JH
