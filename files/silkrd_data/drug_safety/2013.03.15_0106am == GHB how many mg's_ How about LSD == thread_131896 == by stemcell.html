				For vendors on L, visit the first page of the LSD Avengers thread. <br /><br />For first time L dose, go in. It may not be worth it, and you may be let down on your first trip if you skimp on the dose. Drop like 200ug, sit back, relax, and go with it..embrace every bit of what you feel, and you will never look back<br /><br />As for the GHB ive never done, nor know any one who does IRL so i know only what ive read from other members, and I think i recall always seeing it dosed in ml not mg, might be wrong though.

				thanks for the feedback ghb is usually a mg/ml form im just not sure what the mg dose avg is to my best knowledge.<br /><br />does anyone know if you can burnout on K like you do on MDMA where it just does not work anymore?<br /><br />i guess my real question is we have a fun weekend with some friends planned in a month and im trying to figure out what our option are when mdma is no longer working? i know G, K, maybe Lsd which i have never done. will shrooms and lsd not work if you used them over the course of the same weekend? not sure if they work off the same body functions. I dont touch meth, coke is an option. This is all somewhat experimental for me so i figure why not give it all a shot at different points. ive used g, mdma, coke, shrooms but never k, lsd, or many others.

You will have a very high tolerance very quickly though, very high.

				I have plenty of experience with GBL, GHB powder, and GHB. <br /><br />I hate GHB liquid. <br /><br />I love the other two! <br /><br />GBL I&#039;d start with 1.5ml-1.75ml to start. On an empty stomach! <br />GHB powder I&#039;d start with 1.5g-2.0g. On an empty stomach. <br /><br />Do not redose till after 1.5-2.0 hrs till you start to know your body. Also it stays in your system and will stack itself and get you tore up if you dose too close. <br />Be careful, you will throw up if too high a dose!

				Holy shit there is G powder??? I f-ing hate the taste of G more than anything. Does anyone on SR sell it? 1.5-2g really? That seems like alot since i see MIMM selling it in 10ml vials at 50mg/ml and 100mg/ml. Im not doubting you but can anyone else verify or back up these statments so i dont kill myself and others should I be able to find powder g? <br /><br />any info is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />When you say i will never feel K what does that mean? Meaning i will feel nothing if someone kicked me or I will never know that im doing it? im a bit confused but appreciate your feedback as well. Lastly, what is it people like about K? I know i can google that but id like to hear from some real life users if its a lover or hate relationship.

The tolerance builds overnight if your use is consecutive, but it always gets you where you need to be, just how much it takes is the variable when using often.<br /><br />&nbsp;I cant speak for every one, but i love it for soo many reasons. Mainly because of how versatile the high can be, the amount and frequency of your dose, can produce a slue of different feelings. I personally have never had the same trip twice, and have been using K for over a decade. This is not to say that it has inconsistent effects, just that the &#039;feel&#039; of the effects can change. I swear by K for too many reasons to list, but you name it, K does the trick LOL.

				Thanks so much for taking the time to write feedback. Im very excited to give it a try. I always start small. With K so to speak, would 100mg be a good conservative starting dose and adjust from there depending on feelings or is it something that you need to start at a higher mg/ml? just trying to figure out how much to buy to have a good time with some great friends. <br /><br />Very Excited to try this G to.

				<br />Yes. 1.5g - 1.75g of GHB powder is a dose. Its not like mdma or something. I actually measured out 1 gram and then put it into a measuring spoon so I can see how much to dose more quickly. I believe I ended up using a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to dose with=1g. Weigh it out to make sure and just keep that spoon separate for quick dosing. <br /><br />GBL is like I said, around 1.5ml-1.75ml will rock you on an empty stomach.

				Last time i ordered GHB it came in those typical small plastic vials with a screw cap.<br />I only used it a few times before but that was years ago.<br />I used 2/3 or 3/4 of the vial and gota very good rush, wouldnt have taken much more to put me out. Ide say 3.5ml should be still save and proper strong. <br />Whatever you do btw, DO NOT mix with alcohol!!!

				just ordered some powder. cant wait to try it out. now i need to think of a way to get a GF to take it...up the butt just came to mind lol. She wont snort or shoot (im not into shooting anything) so mixing though it will be weaker. I wonder if I turn it into a transdermal cream. I have a little pharma back ground it me, that would be easy but the absorption rate would not be as good. ill let you know what i come up with.

				<br />All this talk of the G&#039;s made me pull some out. Took 1.5ml of jennifers GBL and it did the trick. An extra .3ml would have had me spinning for sure. Me and the Mrs had a smashing good time. I keep forgetting I have it! Been too busy!
