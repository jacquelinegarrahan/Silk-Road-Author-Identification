				I&#039;m not sure what the first step is, but the last step is you live just long enough to wish you had never done heroin and then OD.

				Hey, the whole point of this board is harm reduction. To give advice on proper dosage and techniques so people don&#039;t kill themselves, not to preach at him.<br /><br />That said I have no idea really, have you considered snorting it instead?

				Now pay attention. First you take the graham. You stick the chocolate on the graham. Then, you roast the mallow. When the mallow&#039;s flaming, you stick it on the chocolate. Then you cover it with the other end. Then, you stuff. Kind of messy, but good!<br /><br />

				For the sake of safety I am going to go through the very steps used to make IV’ing Tar less punishing to your veins. Tar is not like powder. <br />All tars have by products that must be minimized for your safety.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used a 100 unit (1 milliliter) diabetic syringe having the smallest gauge available of 30. I drew up one full milliliter of purified bottle water and squirted it into a standard Tablespoon. I then rolled up the tar into a small ball and dropped it mid center of the spoon and water. I then heated up the spoon with a lighter to warm the water. Once I saw steam rising, I stopped. You do not want to let water boil. I then took the cap cover of the syringe and began to push and separate the tar into the water. Once the tar had broken down and was fully dissolved, I dropped in a blue Litmus Paper. The color remained bright blue indicating a high alkaline content.&nbsp; I then took the lighter and re-heated a second time.<br />The water was a very dark, thick color.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;I placed a small piece of cotton into the spoon and sucked up the solution until the spoon was empty and the cotton fully heaved. I then took my moistened .22-micron wheel filter and ran the tar solution through it and back onto the spoon. At this point the tar solution was much more clear, almost slight rust color. I then took an eyedropper and put in about 3 drops of a natural apple cider vinegar into the spoon. I took a fresh piece of Litmus Paper and the paper now turned into a lighter blue indicating the Ph level had been raised from alkaline to a more neutral Ph. I placed a new piece of cotton into the spoon and sucked up all the solution with the syringe until the cotton was fully heaved a second time. The watercolor was now slightly brown tinted and appropriately Ph balanced to minimize sting to my veins.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;I then took some antibacterial soap gel and washed the area at the bend of my elbow where a nice juicy vein was. I burped the syringe, wiped my vein with cotton. The needle was inserted into my vein, then I drew back to check for blood flow to ensure I had hit the vein. When using tar, it is very important that you hit a vein and not pop your skin, as this is where Black Tar can create the most damage to tissue. I shot in approximately 50 units (1/2 a milliliter) and then withdrew the needle. I waited about 5 to 10 minutes and began to feel the dope kick in and blew the rest of the syringe into my vein. The tar still stung some indicating that the next time I need a few more drops of vinegar. I got a real nice heavy, yet mellow buzz.<br /><br />For those of you that are Not into IV’ing, you can simply follow steps 1 and 2 and instead of a syringe use an eyedropper and place about 5 drops into each nostril. If there’s any sting adjust with apple cider vinegar.<br /><br />For Powder Heroin, simply follow the same Steps EXCEPT:<br /><br />Step 1. You do not have to Heat a 2nd time.<br />Step 2. You typically only need to pass through cotton one time.<br />You do not need to add Vinegar or anything to change Ph<br /><br />oppyate

				very considerate of you to post that helpful tutorial. i was just going to tell him its been posted in the h thread and other places so to search for it. <br /><br />but seriously bro, if you cant even spell the name of the drug you dont need to be doing it. heroine is not a drug... thus the helpful responses. heroin is one hell of a drug. <br /><br />you clearly are a new user and i would not recommend you start by shooting. please cut out a small line and just snort the dope. then once youre addicted and need crazy doses, you still have IV to fall back on to further the addiction (i still dont shoot, and im fucking hooked hard enough.) seriously something you should put some thought into first

				I would personally NEVER use vinegar. VitC or Citric Acid, at a last push then lemon juice. Vinegar has a whole heap of nasty fungi in it!<br />Stick with smokin and snorting as above mentioned - keeps it more of a hobby than an addiction. If using brown I usualy split a bag in 2. Snort half and smoke half and I&#039;ll be happy as a drooling spastic.<br /><br />Source: Knowing a lot of serious smackheads

ONLY for Tar. Never for Powders as I mentioned. <br />Tar on to itself is a nasty creature and very alkaline. IMHO there&#039;s never been any harm in a few drops of natural Apple Cider to your Tar Solution before you very adequately Filter. Otherwise, be it nasally or worse, IV&#039;d, it will burn like a mother fucker.

				Oppy-<br /><br />People talk about .2 micron filtering.&nbsp; I have had abscesses before -<br />(when I started, I wasn&#039;t so good at hitting veins, and routinely said fuck it and injected IM - for fuck&#039;s sake, please don&#039;t anyone else do this!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve had 3 cut out of me.&nbsp; Not as bad as it could be, but still enough to be WAY more cautious now!)<br /><br />So, as a precaution, I would like to try to step up my cleanlieness in IV (now that I am better at hitting veins, I don&#039;t want to get some sort of blood infection).<br /><br />Where/how can I get the filters spoken of?<br />
