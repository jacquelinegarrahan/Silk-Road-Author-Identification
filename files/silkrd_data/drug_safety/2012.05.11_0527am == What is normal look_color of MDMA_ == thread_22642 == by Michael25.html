				I have received a couple different small orders of MDMA. All three look very different.<br /><br />One looks pure white, almost like salt but crystaline like. Shiney.<br /><br />One looks off white, tan. With small pieces, medium and some larger pieces. Some tan color is darker then the other but very slightly.<br /><br />The last one looks more like the first. More of a white power/salt type.<br /><br />Is there a &quot;normal&quot; color/texture MDMA looks like? I&#039;m very surprised on how different two of them really are. Swim has only tried the tan looking stuff, but not the white. Had to dose to 250mg and got an &quot;ok&quot; ride. Not sure if swim should use the same dose with the white powder stuff. Is one usually more potent or no one can tell this.<br /><br />

				In my experience color has been no true indication of quality. As long as its bitter crystals, i&#039;ve been satisfied. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had MDMA crystals be purplish, amber, tan, white, or off-white. <br /><br />It&#039;s strange 250mg was &quot;ok&quot;, usually 250mg of pure MDMA should have someone feeling amazing, if not more. <br />Was the person who took it on any SSRI meds?<br /><br />Wait another 2-3 weeks before your next roll and try 150mg of the other stuff.<br /><br /><br />Also get a test kit<br /><br />http://dancesafe.org/products/testing-kits

				pure reagent grade mdma is translucent non-colored crystals which forms white and shiny powder.<br /><br />even just a small percentage of color contaminant can greatly alter the visual appearance which is why the color has little indication of quality. some chemists add color to personalize their batches or for bag appeal. can be purple but the product could still be 99 percent mdma...<br /><br />in other cases darker off-white or even brown coloration usually indicates the chemist did not take the extra time to further recrystallize and purify the product, and would be recommended.<br /><br />a common contaminant, safrole, can be leftover frequently and is highly carcinogenic. it will produce a false positive for marquis reagent tests i believe as well... so is actually sometimes added to make batches appear as if they have mdma when they dont.<br /><br />you can remove the safrole and color contaminants by washing, some using acetone or other non polar, then filter or recrystallize which will provide a much cleaner product

				Already taken 216mg of it and got a very, very nice buzz. But it just ends too quick. Hour later, I&#039;m just coming down slowly. I thought X was supposed to last longer. I guess I should get some tests anyway.<br /><br />
