				Hi All!<br /><br />I am interested in experimenting with &#039;smart drugs&#039; mainly for the purposes of finishing off a book I have been writing for some years and for working on accounts (which I do to allow me to write). Are there any users that have taken Modafinil/Ritalin/Adderall/Piracetam or an others that I may have never heard of?<br /><br />Each task requires different forms of concentration, the writing requires creative thinking and memory recall, the number crunching requires stamina, both need focus - can anyone recommend anything from personal experience available in the UK (or at least to be sent successfully to the UK)?<br /><br />Many thanks!

				I have a pretty extensive experience using smart drugs. I also am a writer, and they greatly helped for this purpose.<br /><br />My favorite stack was Aniracetam, Hydergine, and Centrophenoxine.<br />I would take a stack once or twice daily and found a significant and lasting improvement in my cognition and mental efficiency. I currently am prescribed Vyvanse and therefore cannot take any of the &#039;racetams but I occasionally take a day off of the Vyvanse and take a cycle of Aniracetam and Centrophenoxine to give my brain a boost on the off days. For your purposes, I&#039;d stick to the nootropics and stay away from prescription stimulants, unless you already have experience using them. As a replacement, I&#039;d suggest Modafinil OR Adrafinil. Adrafinil is basically the prodrug of Modafinil and I personally enjoy it a bit better as it is smoother and feels softer on the body. <br /><br />I hope this helps, feel free to ask more or PM me :)<br /><br />All the best.

				You really should look up and research nootropics like Zip suggested. I was a big fan of taking rhodiola in combination with Huperizne A. and Piracetam. Not only did it make my head space a lot clearer on a daily basis, my reaction to any cognitive issue or test was rapid and on point. I had no trouble focusing, my memory was always clear and correct, but research what is out there first before you start ordering things. Rhodiola and Huperzine A are completely legal and have no side-effects, just when you can&#039;t afford to buy Rhodiola and Huperzine A, prepare to be disappointed that you aren&#039;t as sharp as you once were.

				If you take piracetam, take it with choline. Choline powder is way better than lecithin.

Choline powder is way better than lecithin. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In my experience, you don&#039;t necessarily need to take straight choline, you just need a choline source.<br />-Alpha GPC is one of the best sources of choline because it crosses the blood-brain-barrier more efficiently.<br />-DMAE is another good source of choline and actually works as a cognitive enhancer on its own, helping with memory formation and optimizing oxygen and glucose uptake in the brain.<br />-Centrophenoxine is the boss of these because it is a DMAE molecule bonded with pCPA, which works to increase cellular growth and health.<br /><br />I did not find choline bitartrate to be a very effective choline source. And sometimes I found myself having way too much choline in the brain, which causes some very strange effects, very tight jaw muscles being one of them. So I ended up trying the above sources of choline and found much better results. No headaches, less muscle tension, improved cognitive ability, and synergy with the racetams and hydergine. Felt like someone cleaned out the cobwebs.<br /><br />I would still be on a nootropic regimen if it were financially feasible. It just gets expensive to do consistently. I suggest doing nootropic cycles like one month on, 1-2 weeks off. It also can take about a week to feel the full benefits of these nootropics. I always feel effects on the first day, but they are subtle. I find Aniracetam better than Piracetam just because I find it slightly more stimulating, which helps on the motivation side of things. <br /><br />At the end of the day, it really is up to the user to properly funnel their attention and efforts. People could take the best study aid/smart drug/cognitive enhancer ever invented in the universe and still sit on the computer and eat shit because they&#039;re waiting for the drug to do the work for them. Nootropics are expensive, but I think they are the very best way to go, especially considering that their effects and benefits go far beyond the time that you take those drugs. They actually make lasting POSITIVE changes in the brain&#039;s structure. <br /><br />I hope this is somewhat helpful :)

				No problem man, glad to help you out&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Not trying to sound like a salesman but....<br />I also have some guides I&#039;ve complied and written myself on nootropic regimens in case you&#039;d be interested in giving me some coin for them in the future :) <br /><br />I&#039;d be cool with letting you see them and deciding if you wanted to give me some coin for them.<br /><br />

				zipstyle: I&#039;ve been using aniracetam/centrophenoxine in conjunction with dexamphetamine for a while now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of amphetamines inhibiting racetams, and given that the mechanism of action is still laregely unknown I don&#039;t see how they could make that claim without specifically testing it(pubmed shows no results) <br /><br />That being said, I&#039;d love to know if it has! they aren&#039;t necessarily cheap to my country so if I&#039;m wasting my time I&#039;d like to know.

				I have taken some Addys, though I am no journalist, I pride my self on being very well spoken, imaginative, and highly intelligent.. I find the &#039;smart drugs&#039; only seem to make me focus on the task at hand very acutely, but dont actually help me carry out the task any better than had I not been on the Addy. <br /><br />&nbsp;I would suggest, if possible of coarse, dosing some LSD and reading over what you have so far, as to read it from the viewers POV, with your head full of LSD, you will surly come at your writings with a load of new angles and fresh point of view. Good luck friend.

Thanks!<br /><br />I have noticed much improved productivity with many illicit drugs, Mephedrone for example allows me to complete super-human tasks over many hours/days, the pleasure/sexual element ultimately distracts and lack of appetite/dehydration/aging mean that it is simply not sustainable without sacrificing my health in a way that I just can&#039;t justify anymore. Psychedelics may be an interesting way forward though..I am at the early stages with experimentation with them after some years on stimulants.<br /><br />What kind of an LSD dose has anyone found to be most useful for creative purposes out of interest?

				Great, let me know!<br /><br />As for psychs, I&#039;d say low dose (5mg or less) 2c-e or 20 mg 2c-c or 25-80 mics of LSD should be good dosages for your purposes.

				I&#039;m prescribed 60mg of Ritalin daily.&nbsp; I cycle between Rit and desoxyn due to tolerance.&nbsp; For me Ritalin is best ADHD drug out there and to get to where I could get desoxyn spanules I had to try everything.&nbsp; They&#039;re my friends favorites too.&nbsp; They work, but won&#039;t make you feel like a tweaker... unless jaw clenching and all that shit is your thing.<br /><br />My non-tolerant friends that enjoy them as nose candy say they are coke-like for them which makes sense if you study up methylphenidates route of action.

Theoretically, you can&#039;t learn how to take an IQ test and no matter how much you &quot;study&quot;, your score won&#039;t increase, at least not by much, but that&#039;s not the case with most standardized tests. A proper study regimen and no drugs can produce significant improvements on tests like the SAT, GRE and MCAT. That&#039;s why study courses exist which guarantee certain levels of improvement. So maybe your scores increased because of practice.<br /><br />I also think the benefits of nootropics are greatly exaggerated, mostly by people who want a simple solution for the difficult problem of cognitive improvement. I don&#039;t think that solution exists. You can&#039;t just pop up a pill and raise your IQ by 20 points. But there are activities that can improve your memory, reasoning skills, reading comprehension, etc. Mostly they involve memorizing, solving logic problems, and reading. :)

Perhaps, as with many things, just the belief that they can help can actually be beneficial in itself? I will be sure to report back once I have tried, I&#039;ll keep as open a mind as possible and try to be as objective as I can..

				Some of my friends went to medical school, where they studied 6 hours a day, reading and memorizing a lot of material. After a few months, they anecdotally noticed that their ability to remember things like phone numbers and grocery lists had improved. So I think you can improve certain aspects of cognition, but it takes work -- perhaps hundreds of hours of work. Some drugs may help you along the way, but I doubt the drugs alone will improve cognition.
