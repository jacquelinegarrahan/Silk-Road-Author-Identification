				Ok so my friend is 130lbs and planning to try &quot;Superior Methylone pure 100mg caps no filler!&quot; by nawlins or &quot;Methylone Capsules * 175mg each * Moonrock Crystal&quot; by foreverjung (Which do you guys recommend?)<br /><br />how many should a first time user take? and what about the 2nd time? because I want to try it first before I take it at a festival. I don&#039;t want to be FLOORED, I want to be pretty active and dancing<br /><br />And is it ok to take Methylone on saturday and MDMA the next day? will it mess up my serotonin? <br /><br /><br />

				But I&#039;d go with the 100&#039;s cause you can always take more. The first time I did m1 it was sold to me as molly so I took like 300mg at once while I was already rolling on mdma and it fucked me up. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I think it&#039;ll be fine taking it those days but I do recommend taking a little bit of m1 while you&#039;re rolling on mdma. It adds the to wanting to party feeling of m1 to the empathy part of molly.

				I did about 100-120mg my first time ( I weigh 140lbs) It&#039;s tricky to get it right the first time but methylone is one of those drugs that aren&#039;t conducive to redosing.

				Methylone will never &#039;floor&#039; you, its just not that kind of drug... and like stated above, any dose over 200mg with m1, is totally useless.

				So nothing over 200mg then.<br /><br />So what about my serotonin? Will it deplete the serotonin levels? I plan on taking M1 a day before I take MDMA<br /><br />And do you guys recommend any of the sellers above selling capsules?<br /><br />How often can you do M1 safely? I know MDMA is 1-3 months

				Ive never done the shit, only know what my buddies tell me..<br /><br />I know it will have some slight cross tolerance properties with MDMA, but MDMA is real, m1 is caca..lol So just go light on the methylone, then go the fuck in on the MDMA the next night, your sure to blow up.<br /><br />Use this dose guide: 1.5mg MDMA per kg of your body weight.

				FOREVERJUNG by a mile, he is the most professorial vendor on the road. Go with him or tigerrush and your going to have a great time. For the dose go with 150-175mg, redosing is pretty much pointless and will only give you more stimulation but without any real euphoria. Yes it will deplete your levels of serotonin and dopamine so doing it the day before mdma is a bad idea. At least make sure you take plently of antioxidants like alpha lipoic acid, green tea extract, vitamin e, a decent multivitamin, b-complex all before and after any mdma, mda, bk-mdma use. post load with 5-htp, l-dopa, and milk thistle and make sure you stay hydrated. Also i recommend magnesium glycinate for a natural and effective way to combat jaw clenching and it helps a bit with tolerance. You may also want to look into L-theanine to help you relax the day after.
