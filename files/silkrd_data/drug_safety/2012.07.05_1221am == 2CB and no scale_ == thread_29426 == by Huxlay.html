				2CB would be one of the worst things to try to eyeball as it is so dose sensitive. I did 2cb for the first time last weekend and 20 mg&#039;s looks like almost nothing.

				&quot;Around 20-30mg&quot;<br /><br />LOL!<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve never had 2C-B before, am I right? The dose - response curve is so steep you really want to know how much you&#039;re taking within 5mg. In fact even 5mg makes a big difference.

				1g = 1000mg, so 0.20 is 200mg mate, not 20!<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some 2CB here that I haven&#039;t tried, but I wouldn&#039;t dream of taking the stuff without a 0.000 scale - a decent trip is supposedly 16-18mg (0.016 - 0.018).&nbsp; You can&#039;t eyeball that.<br /><br />If you&#039;re doing any RC&#039;s or powders, look at investing in a decent scale as an investment in your own health and safety.&nbsp; :)

				Well.........<br /><br />If your scale is at least reading, you could do 50:50 splits to get down to 30mg in 6 steps......but even then it&#039;s sketchy as fuck because you can&#039;t account for minute losses after every step.&nbsp; Even at 30mg, you could be out +/- a whole fuckload.<br /><br />I mean, I wouldn&#039;t do that but hey, it&#039;s your brain, feel free to fuck it as you please.&nbsp; :)

I was propelled into something not of my choosing. Everything that was alive was completely fearsome. I could look at a picture of a bush, and it was just that, a picture, and it posed no threat to me. Then my gaze moved to the right, and caught a bush growing outside the window, and I was petrified. A life-form I could not understand, and thus could not control. And I felt that my own life-form was not a bit more controllable. This was from the comments of a physician who assured me that he saw no neurological concerns during this dramatic and frightening experience. <br /><br />The Accidental OD<br /><br />(with 100 mg) I had weighed correctly. I had simply picked up the wrong vial. And my death was to be a consequence of a totally stupid mistake. I wanted to walk outside, but there was a swimming pool there and I didn&#039;t dare fall into it. A person may believe that he has prepared himself for his own death, but when the moment comes, he is completely alone, and totally unprepared. Why now? Why me? Two hours later, I knew that I would live after all, and the experience became really marvelous. But the moment of facing death is a unique experience. In my case, I will some day meet it again, and I fear that I will be no more comfortable with it then than I was just now. This was from the comments of a psychologist who will, without doubt, use psychedelics again in the future, as a probe into the unknown. <br /><br />So you can&#039;t die, but how strong is your mind? Have a good day :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeh that was the lucky thing when it was legal that it doesnt become toxic unlike some of the 2cx&#039;s like 2C-T-7... Know someone who i hadnt met when this had happened but they got hold of 1G of 2CB not knowing much about it at all(And this person is an animal with drugs and loves there cocaine) and they split it into a few big lines as if it would like cheap street cocaine and boy did that give them a shock! Got quite a alot of crazy storys of people doing stupid things with drugs! Some people just dont think...

				I&#039;m about to do this too, but with a smaller starting amount - 250mg.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to put this in to twelve capsules, first dividing the whole amount, then dividing that etc until I get 12 equal amounts.<br /><br />That should be between 15-25mg for each dose, and with 12 capsules, there&#039;s no way one could be above 30mg if I take proper care. <br /><br />also doing this for 250mg 4-aco-dmt, which is less dose responsive but still need care. <br /><br />Wish good mg scales were available.

				Okay so turns out i was able to have a awesome 2cb trip yesterday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is my solution when you dont have a mg scale<br /><br />Eyeball about 20mg in a capsule or a bit less or more. Now Pouring very small amounts onto your hand then licking it off and doing so a few times should have you dosed to a personal desire. It isnt the best way to do it if your trying to be exact on your dosage. but it works out great anyways. Start off with little little amounts, like eyeball 5-8mg onto your hand twice then wait till effects come in then repeat maybe once more, worked out very good in my situation yesterday.&nbsp;

				Glad you had a good trip dude.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally tripped on 2cb about 10 times since starting out on SR (adequately spaced trips of course).&nbsp; To be honest, i&#039;ve tried weighing mine on a friend&#039;s 0.001 scales, but they just weren&#039;t sensitive enough, so I ended up eyeballing prettymuch all my doses.<br /><br />I would not have dared to do this with most of the other 2c&#039;s, 2ct&#039;s etc, and I know it&#039;s not the smartest idea even with the beez, but I was careful, and I got a feel for the material before attempting higher doses.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know whether i&#039;ve built a slight tolerance, or whether I am just naturally a little tolerant, but my last 2cb trip was about 40mg, and it wasn&#039;t overwhelming at all.&nbsp; That&#039;s just me though.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find, if you divide your amount, and take as much time as possible making sure your piles are even you can get close enough with 2cb.&nbsp; Just be careful. The greater the weight you start with, the harder and riskier it will be to divide.<br /><br />Really really need to get me a good 0.001 scale.<br /><br />P.s - was this Ivory&#039;s 2cb by any chance? Great stuff!

About the worst that&#039;s likely to happen is that you will trip a little harder and less comfortably than you might like. But for the love of G-d, please don&#039;t try this with 2c-p or more potent and less forgiving psychedelics.&nbsp; (It&#039;s also good that you&#039;re dosing oral: snorting unweighed quantities of 2c-* is a fool&#039;s game).<br /><br />All that being said, do yourself a favor and invest a few dollars in a microgram scale if you&#039;re going to be buying powders on SR. Eyeballing psychedelics is a disaster waiting to happen. If you keep doing it, sooner or later you&#039;re going to have a really shitty experience.

				Of the 2Cs, I would have to say that 2C-B is one of the best to eyeball (erowid lists strong dosages all the way up to 50mg). I would recommend that you keep dividing it into approximately equal piles. 5 equal piles will give you about 32mg, and 6 piles 16mg. You probably want something in between those two values, so you can adjust appropriately. That being said, if you take too much, be prepared to vomit earlier on in the trip.<br /><br />You can also dissolve your gram in water or ethanol or something, but that requires taking all of it in a short time period, unfortunately...

				Eyeballed some more 2cb last night for 5 of my friends.&nbsp; We hung out in a suburban park and admired the morphing shapes in the clouds and trees.&nbsp; Beautiful&nbsp; reduced frame rate digital/organic combination visuals.&nbsp; Eyeballed about 35 to 40 mg for everyone.&nbsp; Despite being visually intense, everybody&#039;s mood was so perfect (even though there were a couple of newcomers, they felt comfortable despite the high dosage).&nbsp; Just try to be careful with 2cb, but if you go over a little bit, you may very likely have a great time with it, as long as you&#039;re prepared for the intense visual warp!<br /><br />Ahhh I love 2cb.

				the only way you should be dosing without a scale is volumetric. dissolve that shit in a known amount of liquid and dose accordingly.<br /><br />otherwise, buy a god damn scale and don&#039;t be so lax about your safety. 2c-b is forgiving but as stated by TheGrandWizard, you can land in some bad territory if you make this a habit.

				You guys are definitely right.&nbsp; I think SR gives me a &quot;time is running out&quot; type of feeling, like the community could be taken down any month (I hope not). Therefore, i&#039;m more inclined to spend what little I have on the drugs while I can, knowing I can buy scales at any time.&nbsp; I guess this tactic doesn&#039;t work, because the SR keeps on keeping on so far, and I do need to bite the bullet and spend some money on scales instead of drugs.&nbsp; I used my friends 0.001 scales to try to measure, and honestly, it was so inaccurate that it reminded me that when I do get scales, i&#039;d like to spend a couple hundred and be able to accurately measure in the tens of milligrams.&nbsp; I know lots of scales that are cheaper have the capability....but it seems some just don&#039;t live up to the specs.

				I find the &quot;adding some powder to a cap and weighing and then adding/subtracting&quot; method to be unreliable. Or at least, I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing it. Too much uneven weight distribution IMO. I like to add the powder right into the weigh pan and then scrape it out and spoon it into the capsule. You may lose a mg or two in residual powder, but that&#039;ll only happen for the first dose. I use a set of weigh spoons I picked up on Amazon, and the smallest one fits inside a 0 sized capsule, so you can just scrape it out of the pan into that and give it a little nudge to get the powder out. Just my 2 cents!<br /><br />S

				I believe one the the highest inaccuracies to be in the weight of the gelatin capsule. some brands can very weight from capsule to capsule but in this case, you can average out their weight or do it the tedious way of weighing before and after for every pill. to each their own.

				Hey stolea, yeah i&#039;ve been looking a lot online at scales and have strongly considered that exact one, among a few others.&nbsp; I read a few more reviews and it sounds as accurate as I need it to be.&nbsp; Just gotta stock up on a bit more MDMA, 2cb, nbome and acid, and then i&#039;ll get the scale! (I already have all my current drugs measured out to dose while aquiring all the other, and then the scale to weigh them)<br /><br />Also, i&#039;ve noticed the weight and tare function jumping around all over the place up or down 10 to 20 mgs on my friend&#039;s scale, but I was using the capsule scoop, adjust cap contents by shaking it out, reweighing etc.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to have a better scale so I can spend a night packaging and organising my drugs.<br />Gosh that&#039;s fun!<br />And A little cooler than my &quot;saturday nights inside encoding mp3&#039;s and using napster&quot; that I oh so enjoyed in high school!&nbsp; <br />I have more friends now.<br /><br />Hey, does anyone know where to get really really smale capsules?&nbsp; Like, smaller than the typical widely available 00?&nbsp; and does anyone know which absorbs faster in the stomach; vegetable or gelatin based capsules?

I would recommend that you keep dividing it into approximately equal piles. 5 equal piles will give you about 32mg, and 6 piles 16mg. You probably want something in between those two values, so you can adjust appropriately. That being said, if you take too much, be prepared to vomit earlier on in the trip.<br /><br />You can also dissolve your gram in water or ethanol or something, but that requires taking all of it in a short time period, unfortunately...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Nicely put man! <br /><br />I feel like everyone frowns upon eyeballing dosages of RCs its just a common thing because you can really&nbsp; do some serious damage to your brain if you were to accidentally take 50mg+ which i find very rare if you are eye balling the smallest of smallest amounts into a cap then onto your hand. it is not&nbsp; reliable at all when it comes to precision but hey when its a beautiful day outside and you got no way of getting your hands on a mg scale it works like magic.&nbsp; Oh yeah always smoke some dank hash while tripping 2cb you will be blown away, or maybe i just had a hella of a time. I would never eyeball any other 2cs tho other than 2cb. Most 2cs sketch me out. Love 2cb tho!
