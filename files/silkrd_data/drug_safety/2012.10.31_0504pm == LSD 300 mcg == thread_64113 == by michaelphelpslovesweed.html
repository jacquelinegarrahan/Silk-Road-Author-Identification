				so I just got 3 strawberries from HEADSHOP<br /><br />I&#039;m really looking forward to this but I&#039;m not sure wether I shoul take 1, 1 1/2, or 2, or 3 for that given matter<br /><br />they&#039;re supposed to be 150 but I have no way of finding that out.. I shipped them into the US so if they were 150 they&#039;ll be around 120? idk you tell me I read they lose potency<br /><br />any ways it&#039;s my first time doing lsd.. If it&#039;s true that they are 150 and I took 300mcg for my first time ever what could happen?<br /><br />I know starting with 100 or less is the safest thing.. But I want this to be a one time thing (probably won&#039;t be knowing me, but fuck it) so I wanna experience the drug in a huge amount.. I&#039;m not talking about after death experiences like those you get from thumbprints but more like an incredible trip but one that won&#039;t leave me half tripping-half reality as is the case with thumbprints (or so I&#039;ve heard)<br /><br />help is greatly appreciated

				If you have someone who is experienced and willing to spend a day with you in a safe place, go for the 300.<br /><br />Without a sitter I would start with 100 and work on from there.<br /><br />gl

				I&#039;m in USA, ordered only one of Headshop&#039;s strawberries and had an awesome experience. It had a fairly strong effect so I would assume it&#039;s over 100ug, though I have nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />If I had more I would try a double dose. 1 tab is enough for a significant trip, but as long as you are comfortable/prepared/stable and in a safe place, I think you&#039;ll be fine doing 2 tabs. Either way good luck if I&#039;m not too late :)

				One will give you a nice trip - two or more will probably give you a profound experience.<br /><br />If you take more than one make sure your settings are pleasant and safe. LSD is not a &quot;party drug&quot;. Bad trips can get pretty bad and chances of having one are way higher if you are with strangers or in unfamiliar surroundings.<br /><br />In a safe place with experiemced trippers around I trust I would not worry about taking a high dose. If you&#039;re alone or the settings are not fully under your control take a low dose or postpone the trip until you can arrange it better.

				Have you done any psychedelics before? If not it may be best to just start with a single tab so you can get a good feel of what the experience is like before you make the jump to 300ug. If you have some experience, and the set and setting are right, I think you would be fine doing 300ug for your first acid trip.
