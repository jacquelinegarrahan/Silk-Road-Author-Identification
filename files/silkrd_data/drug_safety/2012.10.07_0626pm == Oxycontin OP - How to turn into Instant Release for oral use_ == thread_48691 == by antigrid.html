				After hours upon hours of reading and re-reading different methods to turn the newer oxycontin OP&#039;s into an IR formula for IV/Snorting/Oral use I am very frsutrated. I had two OP 80&#039;s, I use a dremel to grind up one OP after removing the coating and put the powder on foil, then heated just until it turned yellow. Scraped it and snorted but it did not work.<br /><br />At this point I have a little more than half of an OP 80 with the coating removed and I want to convert it to IR for oral use. There are so many different methods and conflicting reports on methods of extracting / converting to IR I figured someone might be able to help here. What is the most effective way to convert it to IR for oral use and get the maximum amount of active drug out of the time release mechanism and into the water/solution?<br /><br />I have an acidic powder that is called &quot;True Lemon&quot; that has citric acid and asorbic acid (and a few other ingredients), but not sure that letting the pill dissolve in water mixed with that will do anything to the time release. I have read about using coca cola but it doesn&#039;t seem like it would convert a large amount of the ER to IR, but again, I just don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Any help would be really appreciate it. Again, I am just asking for oral use, I do not plan to IV these, and snorting did not work. Oxy has a high bioavailability when used orally and always gives me the best effects that way so that&#039;s what I am aiming for.

				you need to heat until it turn dark yellow/brown not just light yellow and stop before it goes dark dark brown and starts to burn. it works some but only slightly and i recommend the microwave which is easier to control without burning it off id say... that method is annoying and ineffective mostly though<br /><br />much more effective is like you mention. cut/chop/grind the pill into smaller pieces to maximize surface area and dump into an acidic beverage. your stomach is acidic, so just like that the drink will start to eat away at the polymer. leave in soda/citrus juice etc for at least a few hours to maximize release into the solution. then drink it all down and it should be nearly the same as an IR dose

Anyways, I was able to get it to turn yellow, but the guide I was reading on opiophile says to NOT let it get dark yellow and if it does get dark yellow then you have overheated the product, are you positive about the dark yellow? It&#039;s actually been easier for me to get it dark yellow, it&#039;s hard to get it all to turn a light yellow before turning it to dark yellow because it changes so fast. I used a piece of tinfoil for this rather than a spoon, and I think it works better. But I also think this method kills 80-90% of the active drug.<br /><br />Anyways, I am going to use the method you said with the &quot;True Lemon&quot; stuff I bought at the grocery store, I think it will work. But are you positive that leaving the powder ion this for a few hours actually gets rid of the polox or whatever it&#039;s called, and frees the active drug? It&#039;s hard to tell how much of the drug can be released this way based on reports I have read. I will wait as long as I have to to ensure it all gets freed up, but I don&#039;t want to wait to long and cause the drug to get destroyed (if that can happen). Here are a few questions I have:<br /><br />- Which would work better: Water mixed with True Lemon (ingredients below) or another type of acidic liquid that doesn&#039;t need to be mixed? (e.g. Coke, Lemon Juice)<br />- How long would you say to leave ground (dremeled) powder in water for most, if not all, active drug released (2/3 of an OP 80)<br />- Should the water be room temp, hot, or cold?<br />- Can the drug be destroyed this way? (leaving it in to long, certain temp, etc)<br />- Do I need to shake or do I just need to stir a little bit?<br />- Does it need to be cooked at all before dumping in water?<br />- How much water is needed?<br /><br />True Lemon for Baking Ingredients:<br />Ingredients: Crystallized Lemon [citric acid, lemon oil, lemon juice, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)], maltodextrin .<br /><br />Thanks again for the reply!

				You spent hours reading, for what? Just chew them shits up, pretty simple. THe more you chew, the less XR it will be. I would recommend just chomping on it a few times and take a substantial dose and it will be like half XR (like 6-8 hrs instead of 3-5 like IR or 12+ like full XR). Chewing OPs is my favorite.

				I don&#039;t know what the hell you guys are talking about with all these science experiments. Use your teeth, simple as that I have taken/chewed OPs many times, if you chew it up a whole lot before swallowing it will be pretty much the same as IR, but like I said having it last longer is pretty fuckin cool so I would chew it for a few seconds and swallow and get a solid 6 hour buzz out of it.

				i dont exactly know what color is should be - just from experience the limited times i have tried, i found it to work best at a dark yellow,brown where you see the stuff actually start to melt well. i agree though this method is a ton of work for little reward overall and dont use it myself anymore - when i had the OPs i was just as hooked snorting as i was on the oxy itself<br /><br />the acid wont hurt the oxy, if you have it powdered with the dremel, just a couple hours (add while swirling to avoid it all clumping together) then stir occasionally. but if you just toss the whole pill in give it overnight <br /><br />idk which will be more acidic, but if you use a few ounces to make a double concentrated solution of the drink mix to make a more concentrated solution and let it dissolve then add the other half of the water (with some sugar i would say for taste) and enjoy <br /><br />never had to heat and it definitely releases it more than just eating the powder ime at least and isnt too much effort, so i will do it cause regular OP just doesnt do it for me personally

The &quot;initial&quot; release of medication may hit faster because you are saving the stomach from having to break it down, but the Polyox is bound to the active drug. I digress...

				Grind down with dremel tool.&nbsp; Boil powder in pure methanol for 15 mins (HEET fuel line dryer from walmart), maybe 10ml per pill.&nbsp; Put a teaspoon of sugar on a plate, pour 5ml on the sugar, microwave until evaporated and repeat until all fluid is gone,&nbsp; scrape and chop up the sugar.&nbsp; The ER is fucked at this point without destroying the good stuff.&nbsp; you can even snort! works on new opanas etc also!

				its actually based in fact, i cant find it anymore but when op first came out i found an article on the pharmacokinetics <br /><br />the polymer doesnt even release the full dose completely and since it takes so long to release what it does (4-6 hrs instead of 1-2), you are already metabolizing and excreting the dose before a large amount has been absorbed - resulting in much lower peak plasma concentrations<br /><br />if someone who is tolerant to OC 80s and take an OP 80 normally they can even experience mild withdrawals at worst or at least not get high or adequate pain relief. there are some who dont notice the difference though - not everyone reacts the same way BS1

I have taken a half of one of those and just swallowed it normal and it lasted 12 hours at least, but very subtle not too fucked up although more 12 hours with some wearing off/afterglow after. <br /><br />I have also chewed up half, that exact same dose of the exact same pill, many, many times and it is like half that length, 6 hours and way more fucked up, much stronger buzz etc. and shorter length, but still longer than popping a roxie. You saying I&#039;m lying? <br /><br />About the tolerance thing, it just depends how much of an opiate addict/patient you are cause obviously tolerance is practically an exponential progression the more you use and the longer you use for. Maybe its just linear, but every week of regular use tolerance will go up.&nbsp; If you&#039;re sayin takin a 80mg dose is an average human tolerance dose that is fuckin absurd. I&#039;ve had 3 major shoulder surgeries, thats just not true.

				As someone who gets a script for 280x 80mg OPs a month and 240x 30mg IR roxis for breakthrough pain I can tell you that the OP&#039;s 100% suck. They are at most 50% as strong as the old formula, and if you want any sort of buzz from them it requires a science experiment. Though I usually just chew them and deal with the stomach ache since they don&#039;t absorb much of the OC and it keeps my tolerance somewhat low.

As far as you personally, you have developed a permanent tolerance from being an addict, period. I abused the shit outta xanax and alcohol together for a little while and now if I take benzos I get practically no effect unless I take a very large dose or drink a 6 pack on top of a regular dose.&nbsp; I take benzos bout once a month on on average these days, if that. Tolerance stays exactly the same...
