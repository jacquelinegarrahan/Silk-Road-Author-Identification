				I got some ayahuasca in the mail by accident from a vendor who meant to ship me something else. <br />i was wondering if there is an ayahuasca thread on here that someone knows of (i couldnt find one using the search bar)<br />and if not can someone who knows about it (or tried it) give me any info?<br />I&#039;m gonna read up on it on erowid, but I&#039;m curuous to hear from ppl who have done it firsthand.

				I haven&#039;t done it, but I know of a few people who have.&nbsp; The first is an older man, who grows and brews his own.&nbsp; He uses it as a spiritual aid, and does it responsibly. No alcohol, etc The other person is our landlords 16 yo son, who showed up at our place one night tripping balls.&nbsp; He bought it off of Ebay, and was using it primarily to just get high.&nbsp; We had to sit him for 5 hours while he saw pink skulls floating around the sky.&nbsp; Not a good scene.<br /><br />I watched DMT - The Spirit Molecule, and it was a pretty good documentary.&nbsp; Check it out.<br /><br />So, all I do know about it, is it&#039;s not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my humble opinion.....:)

				What do you want to know? You didn&#039;t ask anything specific. It&#039;s difficult to give you information if you don&#039;t ask what specifically you want to know. <br /><br />The term ayahuasca encompass many different brews, all of them having subtle differences (for example the effects depends a lot on the harmala vs. DMT content and in part even on the plants used to obtain those substances), so the first thing you should research upon is on the particular brew the vendor sells (and that s/he has sent you for an error) so as to know better what to expect and how to approach it the best you can.<br /><br />In any case ayahuasca is a very wonderful medicine, but since it is a very powerful one if you have not a good prior experience in psychedelics or on shamanism/meditation etc. doing it alone can also not be the best choice (but it naturally depends on your knowledge of certain things and also on your nature).<br /><br />However rest assured of this: A) this &quot;mistake&quot; can actually be for the best; if you approach ayahuasca in a sacred/respectful way you can really have a life changing experience, B) coincidences and mistakes not always happens just for a casualty (in reality almost never, but I know that if I say so many will think I&#039;m a lunatic, so let&#039;s pretend that &quot;not always&quot; they happen for a casualty).

Smoked DMT lasts a short amount of time, maybe 15 minutes. Ayahuasca lasts for a couple of hours. Their subjective effects are vastly different.<br /><br />OP and anybody else interested in ayahuasca. I recommend checking out the documentary Ayahuasca: Vine of the Soul. It&#039;s well worth the watch. Also note that one component of ayahuasca is the MAOI (monoamine-oxidase inhibitor). DMT when taken orally is inactivated by MAO. This is why you can&#039;t swallow 100mg of freebase DMT and trip. The admixture plant (often B. caapi) contains plant alkaloids that are MAOI (harmine, harmaline, and others). The MAOI prevents the DMT from being broken down and then you trip.<br /><br />There are risks with MAOIs! You don&#039;t want to mix certain foods and drugs with them, please do some reading and research on the topic. I also think it would be worthwhile to research the traditional entheogenic usage of ayahuasca in the Amazon, it&#039;s very interesting.

				best movie/documentary I&#039;ve seen so far about ayahuasca = &quot;Other Worlds&quot; from Jan Koenen... <br /><br />You can eat DMT but you&#039;ll have to combine it with (for example) harmine - and, as written in the previous post: before doing such you need to do some research about MAOi&#039;s and their risks... <br /><br />Smoking DMT, smoking changa, eating DMT &amp; harmine or drinking ayahuasca are each quite diverse experiences with different possibilities (and risks). <br /><br />If you want a deep, spiritual experience I higly recommend working with a &quot;guide&quot; (sjaman, curandero, ...).

				as many people here have stated, ayahuasca demands respect, it is not a casual trip.<br /><br />unless yourinterested in some spiritual awakening or self realization; be wary of taking it simply as it is there.<br /><br />if you know anyone who has experiences with holistic medicine &amp; they are trust worthy i would ask them to babysit your ayahuasca trip, purely to guide the spirits and alow your energy to pass through the netherworlds in peace.<br /><br />not having a spirit guide on serious entheogens can be very damaging.

				as have many users previously stated, its not just about the amount that your taking; its set and setting that provides us with the many answers to the questions we seek when taking psychedelics.<br /><br />the context of Ayhuasca IS important. its not like MDMA or 2CB where the history of the compound is wrapped up in rave.<br /><br />opening ones mind and paying respect to the historical significance of certain entheogenic compounds will not only increase the meaning of the trip; but add to its safety.<br /><br />love and respect yourselves as well as your drugs =]
