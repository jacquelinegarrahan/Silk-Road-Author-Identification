				yes but if you&#039;re using it just to get things done dextroamphetamine is preferable for a variety of reasons. less addictive, less euphoric, less neurotoxic, etc., etc. <br /><br />I used to use meth and other amphetamines, but i decided i valued my brain too much, so i switched to ritalin and modafinil.<br /><br />but as to meth&#039;s uses, i have used it for writing for long periods of time, and found it less useful for studying or reading.

				If I&#039;m using it to party I&#039;ll usually just do a 40-50mg line and then maybe, MAYBE one small bump after an hour or two to keep the euphoric high rolling.&nbsp; No more than one redose though, and only usually 10-15mg at most.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that if you redose too many times it&#039;s gonna be hell getting sleep... and you feel like shit too so you do very easily start to think of taking more to avoid feeling shitty, but then you&#039;ll be awake for another 12-14 hours or so...it&#039;s a vicious cycle and I see where people can fall into a trap.<br /><br />But really, meth isn&#039;t a one-way ticket to your doom or anything.&nbsp; I have an addictive personality but only when there&#039;s no drawbacks to the activity in question.&nbsp; My first time with meth was horrible but after learning the hard way not to redose it&#039;s actually a very pleasant drug.&nbsp; At least, I like it more than regular amphetamines because it lacks that twitchy uncomfortable feeling.&nbsp; It&#039;s much smoother than regular speed IMO.<br /><br />The only thing I hate about meth is the social stigma, even people in circles who do some pretty heavy drugs very frequently get all weird if you start talking about meth, because of all the propaganda shoved down our throats about it.&nbsp; Its one of those things you can&#039;t just tell someone you do, unless you know they understand the drug as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard for most people to wrap their heads around it.

				<br />Meth is great to help you find the stickman.&nbsp; You know, that guy that keeps creeping around out the corner of your eye? When you look he&#039;s not there. Then take another hit. lol.

				My experience is that Meth is a drug you should just at most use once in a session and then take a long break. The problems that stem from this drug are repeat users who take again and again to stay awake for days and then turn increasingly psychotic. Also it is very easy to overdose with this drug if you don&#039;t know it, with very negative consequences.

				If I have been able to control use of MDPV (only had once binge with it just to see how far I could go, experienced horrible comedowns like everyone else), do you think meth would present a bigger challenge or is it fairly easy to acknowledge the need to just come down?

				Oh, absolutely! When I first started using meth it was like a miracle.&nbsp; I&#039;d do one tiny bump in the morning, work my ass off with a smile every day at work, come home and get some project done that had been waiting, incomplete for weeks, and then by 10 - 11PM I&#039;d be worn out and sleep all night long.

				Update for this thread:<br />I have since tried meth nasally and can say it is a very clean-feeling stimulant at low doses. I felt like myself and wasn&#039;t regarded in a weird way by the people I had sex with (met up with a couple for a 3some). Was able to eat 2 full meals (am used to eating on dextroamphetamine). Only downside was not wanting to sleep even though I knew I needed to. I hate depending on benzos for sleep. Oh well. I can definitely see how this is useful for getting things done. I felt really even-headed and motivated to do anything I needed to do, even though it was a subtle positive push. Very nice drug if treated with respect, I think. I liked it alot more than MDPV, which I think feels alot more psychotic and anxiety-inducing. Does anyone else have similar experiences? Or am I just thinking this because I haven&#039;t come down from the meth yet?<br /><br />Interested in thoughts/comments/opinions :)

				It&#039;s hard to get really good, clean meth that focuses the mind like pharmies will (adderall, dexedrine, etc.).&nbsp; That&#039;s been my experience, at least.&nbsp; Half the time meth will just make me feel befuddled, kind of like there&#039;s some xylene or toluene or naphtha still left in the gear that&#039;s dulling my mind instead of sharpening it.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s it, maybe it isn&#039;t, but either way: half the time it makes me dumber and spacy-focused, not smarter and super focused.&nbsp; Sucks.&nbsp; Ah well, that&#039;s life.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to point out two things though: one, I consider myself hopelessly addicted to amphetamines and can&#039;t bear the idea of a life without them.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take that as badly as it sounds.&nbsp; Not such a big deal -- I&#039;d quit them altogether, but I&#039;m kind of a lazy useless lump without them and I love learning with them, soooo... yeah.&nbsp; I take the good with the bad and try not to dwell on my addiction too often.&nbsp; That said, I became hopelessly addicted not because I was after recreational pleasure, but because I slowly found myself 100% hooked on studying/working/tinkering while on amphetamines.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I&#039;m really addicted to.<br /><br />... that and the unbelievable sex on occasion, but that&#039;s less productive.&nbsp; So I downplay that part usually and just admit to the working addiction&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Meth is sold as the pharmaceutical desoxyn.&nbsp; Because of the stigma associated with it, it&#039;s rarely prescribed.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically the same thing as adderall though, just slightly different (as you now know).&nbsp; Just an immediate family member of dextroamphetamine, nothing as alien and deadly as they say.&nbsp; If half of what they said about it were even remotely true, I&#039;d be dead, have no teeth, clawed half my skin off, and never come back from my psychotic state.&nbsp; I have all my teeth, have no sores, have never had a psychotic episode, and take meth or adderall every day.&nbsp; I also have no fucking clue where they got those guys from the faces of meth campaign, but whatever.<br /><br />My point is this: why are you tempting fate?&nbsp; And why on Earth did you insufflate it instead of swallow it?&nbsp; Always, always swallow it if your goal is productivity.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; No exceptions, it&#039;s always more effective that way.&nbsp; I sometimes give in and start vaping it because I&#039;m craving the mild &quot;high&quot; it gives me that swallowing doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s helpful.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s highly, highly addictive.&nbsp; No, you do not have to use it for pleasure or hedonism to get hooked.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s clinically recognized as beneficial in various circumstances.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s not clean enough to be reliably useful for what you&#039;re asking it to do.&nbsp; Adderall is.&nbsp; Meth is not.<br /><br />BTW, I&#039;d choose my amphetamine dependence all over again if I had to.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I can&#039;t stop.&nbsp; It&#039;s that I prefer life with them, despite the price: so don&#039;t think I&#039;m saying you&#039;ll wake up and never stop fiending or something.&nbsp; Just hard to let go of that incredible state of mind and what you can accomplish with it for about 24 hours when it all goes right.<br /><br /><br />In the words of Pascal, &quot;I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to devote to making it shorter.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m a little more amped than usual, sorry for the rambling.&nbsp; Not amped enough to edit for 30 mins though, so post button here I come...!

				Meth is good for getting stuff done, for a short while. Then you get in the habit of always using speed when you have something to do, not even because you can&#039;t do it otherwise but just to stay awake so you have enough time to do it, because you&#039;ve been procrastinating and now this thing must be done by tomorrow and you don&#039;t want to fall asleep. And you start to tell yourself that you should always do speed when you have work to do because its shitty work and being high on speed will just make it more fun than doing it sober. Then you find yourself getting high and doing other stuff, like browsing the internet, or organizing your itunes, or pretty much anything other than what you are supposed to be forcing yourself to do. That&#039;s how I feel about it.<br /><br />If there is one thing that METH is good for, it is getting to know someone extremely intimately in a very short period of time. You take meth with a small number of friends, or just one, and stay up for as long as possible talking and telling each other about your life, its amazing.

				Far be it from me to be hypocritical enough to say don&#039;t pursue it, but to be very serious for a minute, that&#039;s one part of my meth use that I do feel guilt/shame/regret over.&nbsp; I&#039;m generally much more productive and much less remorseful when I&#039;m not using it to chase that incredibly potent state of tantric -- I don&#039;t know, bliss is the only word that comes to mind.<br /><br />The problem is that when you get it, the more you take, the hornier you get, the better it feels, the more potent it is, the higher you want it to go, the more you take... and it just doesn&#039;t really stop.&nbsp; I mean seriously, if you keep pushing, you can go for a week like that if you&#039;re a cook and have more of it laying around than you could even use.&nbsp; I mean really, I&#039;ve spent 36 almost straight hours beating off and not even bothered calling in to work to say I was sick (too busy staring at porn, ahem).&nbsp; That&#039;s just not &quot;useful,&quot; ya know?&nbsp; But goddamn does it feel good sometimes...

When you start doing coke at 8 pm and you&#039;re up at 2 or 3 pm the next day still doing lines, you don&#039;t even get high anymore. You&#039;re just keeping yourself awake. Can you actually stay high on meth for 36 hours, or 3 or 4 days like some people do?

Seems that you start to loose the euphoria. Which isn&#039;t bad since i loose euphoria off other stimulants normally by the 24 hour mark and I&#039;m just chasing the rush after that. I try not to pull no longer than a 3 day binge, but sometimes shit happens. My last run was 7 days up and then i crashed on the 8th. By the 7th day, i was no longer getting a high. It was just keeping me up, and the hit was relaxing instead of stimulating. Fun times. :)

				You can go a month if you take enough meth and don&#039;t have a long-time tolerance to it yet.&nbsp; Well, a month might be overstating it, I can&#039;t remember any reliable reports of a full 30 days... but 2+ weeks without a wink of sleep, definitely.&nbsp; There&#039;s a video of some guy who did that... he&#039;s just slumped against a building on the ground, slowly looking around dazedly and chewing on his lips and licking them over and over.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sad, sad sight.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t look unhappy though, lol...<br /><br />The euphoria goes away if you use often enough, but really, who would expect that it never would.&nbsp; On very rare occasions if I&#039;ve been awake for a few days and am using very heavily for whatever reason, I&#039;ll start getting to a state of mind that&#039;s almost magical.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably a step closer to psychosis, to be honest -- I start wondering why I follow social conventions so blindly, why I don&#039;t just say &quot;fuck it, why shouldn&#039;t I go 100 miles an hour?&nbsp; It&#039;s fun, bitch!&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s a magical frame of mind I&#039;ve had happen like twice, but euphoria doesn&#039;t describe it.&nbsp; Powerfully content ambivalence is more fitting...<br /><br />well, who cares really, right.&nbsp; It&#039;s just been on my mind lately.&nbsp; So anyway, yeah, you stay high the whole fucking time.&nbsp; Day after day.&nbsp; The 3 day mark is right about where your ability to function just drops like a stone though.&nbsp; After that, I mean... you can keep going if you take enough, but it&#039;s kind of like... the sleep deprivation and physical exhaustion is so powerful at that point you start getting seriously fucked up.&nbsp; Not full blown schizophrenic hallucinations, but very real and very steady visual disturbances.&nbsp; Blotches like when you roll.&nbsp; Colors being off.&nbsp; Improprerly identifying objects or 2D pictures so that you think you see something that isn&#039;t really there until you stare at it for a minute.&nbsp; I mean you&#039;re fucked up, is what I&#039;m getting at.&nbsp; Longer you go, &quot;higher&quot; you get in that sense.<br /><br /><br />P.S. -- I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only goddamn fool around here, sniper.&nbsp; 7 days is beyond me, though -- I gotta get my coins for more meth somehow, and after 7 days I can&#039;t do a damn thing anybody would pay me for&nbsp; :P

				Well, when i was younger i went over two weeks + without sleeping. Severe psychosis. It&#039;s what makes me respect&nbsp; people that suffer from mental conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m not ashamed in saying that with me being that young, with very low tolerance to meth, knowing very little about meth. In all honesty, it should of made it where i never touched it again. Let alone, use it regularly now. Something just clicked in my brain after that binge. I just loved everything about the experience from the good to the bad. Until this day it&#039;s one of the most life changing events that involve a substance in my life except for psychedelics. (Of course since i have gained so much knowledge from them.)<br /><br />But, I&#039;m rambling. My point is, if you have an underlying condition that you&#039;re un aware of. Don&#039;t push a meth binge. Everyone is different, and when you personally stop getting high. Then why waste more product? Personally, like i said i loose the euphoria on the third day, along with the high turning into more of a calm stimulation. Which means i stop looking for euphoria, and start looking for the rush. Most people forget that a meth high is 2 stages. The rush and then the high. I am still able to get a rush. 2+ weeks, but I&#039;m wasting a lot because I&#039;m doing massive doses because of tolerance. :/ <br /><br />I eat and drink regularly while high. I don&#039;t allow myself to dehydrated, I&#039;ve trained myself through hypnosis to micro nap, and when i don&#039;t have something to do, have to be some where, or talk to somebody. I&#039;m laying down to relax my muscles.

				You know... sometimes I really do think there&#039;s a lot of truth to the statement that if you have ADHD, meth does not do the same thing to you.&nbsp; Because that&#039;s not how it is for me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it was ever like that for me, either.&nbsp; I mean I love amphetamines, and honestly, yeah... I&#039;d probably just commit to being psychotic and a useless tweaker forever if I could stay in that frame of mind 24/7 and never leave it.&nbsp; Fuck it, it&#039;s the best place I&#039;ve ever felt.&nbsp; I mean a good meal with a family and all is basically just as good, but... not in the same way.<br /><br />Alright, I&#039;m lying, it&#039;s not just as good.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;m a junkie who&#039;d rather tweak than have a meal with my family (half the time, I&#039;m not a bad person or anything and love my family).&nbsp; Fuck it, that&#039;s just who I am.&nbsp; Families are nice, but nothing&#039;s as nice as the place amphetamines have taken me or gotten me close to on those rare occasions.<br /><br />Goddamn wandering compulsive chattering... lol.&nbsp; What was I posting to say again, ugh... right, right. For me, it really does make me feel like a much more competent, in control of myself person.&nbsp; I sincerely believe that that&#039;s even half true and it makes me a much better individual in some ways.&nbsp; Other ways, the price makes me a worse person.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a drug, what do you expect, right.&nbsp; All I&#039;m getting at is that I use for a very different reason, but apparently to the same end, sniper.&nbsp; Interesting.

				Thanks guys. The reason I&#039;m asking these questions is because I&#039;m going to try meth for the first time soon. One other thing, based on people who say they dose more and more, it&#039;s harder to overdose on meth than coke, isn&#039;t it? I&#039;m worried about that because it lasts so long. If you do too much coke, at least you&#039;ll start coming down in half an hour. I don&#039;t want to get stuck too high for 8 or 12 hours. That would be hell. Is it more a dopamine high than a norepinephrine / adrenaline high? How do you keep from overdoing it?

This way you know your dosage, and can examine your tolerance as you go along. Also, monitor your vitals. Check your bp and pulse sober than check when your high, check an hour after dose and then at least one more time before redosing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve personally overshot my dose from orally and nasally. Since, it takes a longer onset, i found myself to grow impatient as a noob or i didn&#039;t snort it right as a noob. I&#039;ve only over done it smoking once, but that was once again a poor decision while using other drugs. <br /><br />Things to look for if OD. Sever shaking, the inability to sand, breathing problems, chest problems, and becoming un responsive. Those i have seen personally mean someone is having a bad time. The later needing medical help. Surprisingly I&#039;ve never overshot with IV. Personally, i haven&#039;t found that when i do go overboard to be on the same level as coke. Coke has a lot of epinephrine and can cause quite a scare.&nbsp; It just seems that when i have over done it with meth, it was not necessarily smoother, but less of a roller coaster. <br /><br />What ROA are you planning on using?

He has to approach stimulants now with extreme caution. He tells me as long as he drinks plenty of water, gatorade, and don&#039;t drink them too quickly. He has noticed less negative side effects. Also, he has noticed eating something that is high in sugar every couple of hours help with the weak feeling. I&#039;ve personally watched his pulse hit the 60s after smoking so i think both of you might be suffering from the same thing. <br /><br /><br />But, it could of been the cut in the batch, or the medication combo as well as many other factors. I know the thought of death through the use of any substance can be scarey, but it&#039;s the risk you take each and every time you get high. If allowed my mind to run with the ideas it has of the self harm&nbsp; i have done. I would have a NA 6 month chip at least. Do drugs or don&#039;t do drugs, either way we all are going to die. :/ <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve went through half a gram of kush&#039;s stuff in under eight hours and did notice some weakness, but pulse was elevated and bp elevated which is normal since I&#039;m on meth haha. The times i have over done it is anytime i have went over a half gram in under a 8 hour period . I have a pretty big tolerance so keep that in mind. I wouldn&#039;t advise anyone who is starting to use more than half a point. Even then that might be very strong for you. Start low, you can always add more. :)&nbsp;

Things can get a bit dark if you don&#039;t watch yourself in the beginning. But over time, i started to notice the only time i crash is after a week binge but isn&#039;t nothing compared to some of my first 3 day binges. I had a very poor diet when i first started using. I have improved greatly since then. I included protein shakes into my diet, as well as vitamins. <br /><br />I got all this jibbersh typed into a word document if anyone is interested. I don&#039;t know how much of it&#039;s true since i typed it up while twacked. <br /><br />Also, a lot of people use different terminology when it comes to describing the parts of the high. So here&#039;s mine. <br /><br />Tweaking:The lower end of being high. You can function since tasks are pretty easy, you&#039;re clear headed and for the most part motivated. Seems as if you took a heavy dose of amph indeed. :) <br />Spun:The middle ground of being high. Tasks are harder to finish since you&#039;ll find yourself slightly over stimulated when it comes to sticking to one task mentally. <br />Twacked:You can&#039;t barely function in the sense of doing tasks that involve anything besides getting higher. You can sometimes have a fuzzy or hazy mind set leading to risky behavior. It normally takes a few days to get twacked. Some people call it phycosis , but i believe that twacked and pychosis are different.<br /><br />I like being twacked out all three. I can normally get twacked off a .1 bowl if I&#039;m lucky. :) <br />

				By your definitions man, yeah.&nbsp; I&#039;m all about being twacked too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know, meth is virtually impossible to find where I am and nobody uses it but me -- like for real, I&#039;ve looked before out of desire for some fucking company at 4am, lol...<br /><br />So I&#039;m not too confident in my definitions either, but I always thought &quot;spun&quot; was that nice comfortable state of mind after a couple of days.&nbsp; When it just sort of feels like... well, like you can feel forever melting.&nbsp; How that makes sense I don&#039;t really know, but that&#039;s what it feels like sometimes for me.&nbsp; I guess I call spun what you call twacked.&nbsp; And twacked is what I call being so high that you&#039;re compulsive beyond reason and can&#039;t actually do anything except repeat the same action again and again and again.<br /><br />But like I said.&nbsp; Who knows, I&#039;m the only tweaker I&#039;ve ever met.&nbsp; Wait... can I say that?&nbsp; Have I actually met myself?&nbsp; Yeah, I think I know who I am and don&#039;t lie to myself about it...

				It&#039;s weird that I&#039;ve never done meth, considering I&#039;ve done almost every other class of drugs, except maybe barbiturates and PCP. Meth just isn&#039;t that popular where I live. That&#039;s why I decided to try it. So hopefully this Friday I&#039;ll add that to my repertoire. :)

				Wikipedia:<br /><br />&quot;Absolute bioavailability compares the bioavailability of the active drug in systemic circulation following non-intravenous administration (i.e., after oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, or sublingual administration), with the bioavailability of the same drug following intravenous administration. It is the fraction of the drug absorbed through non-intravenous administration compared with the corresponding intravenous administration of the same drug. The comparison must be dose normalized (e.g. account for different doses or varying weights of the subjects); consequently, the amount absorbed is corrected by dividing the corresponding dose administered.&quot;<br /><br />...<br /><br />&quot;Therefore, a drug given by the intravenous route will have an absolute bioavailability of 100% (f=1), whereas drugs given by other routes usually have an absolute bioavailability of less than one. If we compare the two different dosage forms having same active ingredients and compare the two drug bioavailability is called comparative bioavailability. Although knowing the true extent of systemic absorption (referred to as absolute bioavailability) is clearly useful, in practice it is not determined as frequently as one may think. The reason for this is that its assessment requires an intravenous reference, that is, a route of administration that guarantees that all of the administered drug reaches the systemic circulation. Such studies come at considerable cost, not least of which is the necessity to conduct preclinical toxicity tests to ensure adequate safety, as well as there being potential problems due to solubility limitations.&quot;<br /><br />And here&#039;s where it gets real fun:<br /><br />&quot;These limitations may be overcome, however, by administering a very low dose (typically a few micrograms) of an isotopically labelled drug concomitantly with a therapeutic non-labelled oral dose. Providing the isotopically-labelled intravenous dose is sufficiently low so as not to perturb the systemic drug concentrations achieved from the absorbed oral dose, then the intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics can be deconvoluted by virtue of the their different isotopic constitution and thereby determine the oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics from the same dose administration. This technique eliminates pharmacokinetic issues on non-equivalent clearance as well as enabling the intravenous dose to be administered with a minimum of toxicology and formulation. The technique was first applied using stable-isotopes such as C-13 and mass-spectrometry to distinguish the isotopes by mass difference. More recently, C-14 labelled drugs are administered intravenously and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) used to measure the isotopically labelled drug along with mass spectrometry for the unlabelled drug.&quot;<br /><br />... bioavailability is a lot more complicated than you&#039;d think.&nbsp; Point is: it&#039;s a nice guide, but if you aren&#039;t a biochemist, you probably don&#039;t understand what it really means.&nbsp; Which is fine, I&#039;m not saying I do or anything&nbsp; :P

				There are side effects for it, regardless oral or smoked. The side effects of oral last a long time (several hours) so beware. It gives you palpitation (feeling your heart jumping in the mid of the night), does increase your libido alot, blurs your vision, and makes you feel dissociated with your body and depression sets in. It also makes you muddle-headed for several days (after smoking). Bro didn&#039;t check his BP but he feels &#039;spacey&#039;, &#039;lonely&#039; and &#039;sexually depressed&#039; and he realized this crystal is not to be messed with. Bro was not addicted to it though and doesn&#039;t think Ice is the most addictive substance to use (maybe sex is more addictive).

				So just a follow up. I went ahead and tried meth. I did get blurry / double vision, so it&#039;s interesting that you mention that. It felt a lot like coke, which shouldn&#039;t be a surprise since they both increase dopamine. I would describe it as super-coke. You do a line smaller than a coke line and stay high for hours. At the same time, it didn&#039;t last 12 hours or any of these ridiculous time frames that I often hear. I re-dosed every 4-6 hours. <br /><br />The worst part for me was teeth grinding. That lasted a whole day after I quit using it. My jaw muscles were so sore and swollen, one side popped when I chewed. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do it again, but at least I can scratch it off my bucket list.

				&quot;super-coke&quot; ... yeah thats pretty much my moniker for it too.<br /><br />I ended up having a 3 day binge last week, which was...fun.&nbsp; But it was more due to the fact I had responsibilities to keep up with, then got invited to a party, turning what would&#039;ve been a 32 hour binge into a 3.5 day one.&nbsp; By day 3 it wasn&#039;t getting me &quot;high&quot; so much as keeping me going through all the shit I was doing.&nbsp; Did get some sleep shortly after that adventure, didn&#039;t go crazy, feel like picking at my skin, brushed my teeth and ate 3 meals a day despite being tired as hell.<br /><br />My biggest recommendation?&nbsp; Don&#039;t smoke it.&nbsp; I believe you get more initial rush and more intense but shorter lived high but a lot more of the residual side effects, plus you&#039;re more inclined to chase the high because of the shorter duration.&nbsp; Keeping my doses under 50mg for recreation and 20-30mg for function seems to be pretty practical and doesn&#039;t seem to be too damaging or crashy afterwards.&nbsp; I only snort it though.&nbsp; Tried oral and it was kind of weak and unsatisfying, but longer lasting.&nbsp; The bioavailability of meth orally is like 50-60% or so though so that&#039;s probably why, i used an identical snorting dose.<br /><br />I like meth more than adderall thats for sure, addy makes me so twitchy and jittery, meth is pretty much identical without the twitchy feelings, its very smooth and the comedown is not too hard to handle if I&#039;m eating throughout the day and not dosing too high.&nbsp; Slight depression the day after but it&#039;s ignoreable.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know why they are pushing the anti-meth ads so hard, I mean I kind of get it:&nbsp; yes it can get out of control in the hands of irresponsible (hell, even responsible) users, and its more or less to keep people afraid of trying it &quot;even once&quot;...but all in all it seems more economical to me than coke.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is the social stigma attached to it, and the faces of meth hype.&nbsp; I can&#039;t suggest meth to friends because they&#039;ll literally think I&#039;m heading towards ruin, despite they almost never do any research on the drugs they like.&nbsp; One day maybe...<br /><br />It&#039;s great for parties, marathon sex, first dates, and power cleaning your house.&nbsp; The only thing that worries me is that lately I&#039;ve been subconsciously trying to rationalize that it&#039;s good for sitting at my computer playing games for hours too.&nbsp; Which...is a total waste.

				Look at it this way man: what isn&#039;t a waste?&nbsp; Using it for work?&nbsp; But why isn&#039;t that a waste -- because it helps you succeed?&nbsp; But why is succeeding not a waste?&nbsp; ... because you want it, and enjoy it?&nbsp; Well... don&#039;t you want and enjoy video games too?<br /><br />... see what I mean?&nbsp; Everything is kind of a waste if you follow the motivation for it far enough.&nbsp; Life is to be enjoyed: if you enjoy it... do it.&nbsp; The trick is knowing whether FOR YOU, something is going to lead to more enjoyment... or if it&#039;s going to lead to an ultimate loss of more enjoyment than it brings.<br /><br />BTW, I hate coke.&nbsp; I actually dislike the sensation (unless I&#039;m already tweaking, then it feels pretty good, oddly enough).&nbsp; So I wouldn&#039;t exactly call meth super coke, but... yeah.&nbsp; I see your points: lasts longer, is stronger, and is even cheaper.

				Eh I&#039;m trying to set SOME limitations on my use man&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s not a waste, as there isn&#039;t a time I hated being high on it...yet... but I&#039;d rather have more available for things I enjoy doing while speeding.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t get very much enjoyment from vegging out on it.&nbsp; I need to be active unless all I&#039;m trying to do is stay awake for a work shift.

				Good info for sure, wish I read this like a month ago.&nbsp; Definitely gonna take a break and try that sensitization dose schedule out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve binged twice since picking up meth but never smoked and it&#039;s always been under 40ish hr binges maximum.&nbsp; Definitely think I&#039;ve got the hang of this shit now though as far as knowing when i&#039;ll be able to sleep and resisting redosing.

				Researchers are just discovering&nbsp; what many of us in the users circles have known for along time now: Meth is very effective at combating the Flu, as well as the common cold -and its a mystery how it works.<br />It suppresses appetite, and combats fatigue which can be useful , ive known some alcoholics that credit meth for getting them to quit drinking. It also has a painkilling type effect.<br />the usefulness of meth would depend on how you look at it: I mean what use is viagra really?Who cares if old geezers get to poke their old bags?<br /><br />ever hear that guns dont kill people: people kill people?well meth doesnt cause people to get addicted, its a person&#039;s own behavior that creates it.

				Couple questions about meth: I ended up getting half gram from hammer time earlier and liked it alot. But I got another gram, just came in yesterday, did a pretty big shot and got high as fuck (at like 2 pm) for a few hours and it was pretty awesome. It felt similar to MDMA honestly, but with less empathy. Later I&nbsp; tried to force myself to sleep and managed a little bit but mostly felt burnt out and miserable all night. This morning/today (christmas, which sucks) my head has been busy as fuck and I have no desire to do anything... I did another much smaller shot in the morning and barely got high, my heart just started beating more quickly and I started sweating even more. Now at 5 i&#039;m still feeling fuzzy and cloudy and my head is heavy, it&#039;s definitely unpleasant.&nbsp; Do any of you guys have problems like that? Probably due to the large (eyeballed :( ) dose and ROA but still curious. I&#039;m thinking about just saving the rest of the gram for school and using it for studying/work like adderal. <br /><br />Also, do you fellow tweakers ever get concerned about the neurotoxicity of meth? There&#039;s some pretty significant research on it and that personally scares me more than absolutely anything.<br /><br />Also I read about the sensitization in the safe use of ice sticky.. the author said that it wouldn&#039;t be useful if your brain has already been exposed to amphetamine neurotoxicity, which I&#039;m pretty sure I suffered from ridiculous doses of MDPV a few months ago but earlier in the thread someone talked about trying it. Any opinions? <br /><br />Curious about what people think about the actual high of meth too... I definitely feel like I&#039;m lacking on the euphoria when I do, it&#039;s barely even enjoyable, just speedy honestly.

				Yeah you&#039;re right, I just remember reading in that thread that it&#039;s effects on sensitization were the same but looking back I can&#039;t find where I read that. I&#039;ve also taken relatively rare and infrequent doses of adderal and ritalin for school.. in that case (keeping in mind i did a big ass shot yesterday, probably 80 mgs), any idea if I should try that?

This morning/today (christmas, which sucks) my head has been busy as fuck and I have no desire to do anything... I did another much smaller shot in the morning and barely got high, my heart just started beating more quickly and I started sweating even more. Now at 5 i&#039;m still feeling fuzzy and cloudy and my head is heavy, it&#039;s definitely unpleasant.&nbsp; Do any of you guys have problems like that? Probably due to the large (eyeballed :( ) dose and ROA but still curious. I&#039;m thinking about just saving the rest of the gram for school and using it for studying/work like adderal. <br /><br />Also, do you fellow tweakers ever get concerned about the neurotoxicity of meth? There&#039;s some pretty significant research on it and that personally scares me more than absolutely anything.<br /><br />Also I read about the sensitization in the safe use of ice sticky.. the author said that it wouldn&#039;t be useful if your brain has already been exposed to amphetamine neurotoxicity, which I&#039;m pretty sure I suffered from ridiculous doses of MDPV a few months ago but earlier in the thread someone talked about trying it. Any opinions? <br /><br />Curious about what people think about the actual high of meth too... I definitely feel like I&#039;m lacking on the euphoria when I do, it&#039;s barely even enjoyable, just speedy honestly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It sounds like you got twacked. I personally enjoy being twacked more than i do tweaking. Most people don&#039;t enjoy being twacked because it&#039;s uncomfortable for them. Sometimes when meth isn&#039;t doing it for me anymore. I have to take a tolerance break and come back hard. (I don&#039;t recommend this because it is wreckless.) If everything doesn&#039;t go black, i can feel my heart thumping hard against my chest, and a vibration through every muscle. I&#039;m not high enough! I normally tend to get a blurr feeling that everything blends together in the day and the sun rises and sets without me noticing.&nbsp; <br /><br />How about your diet, exercise regiment, or the size of your doses? Are you sleeping often and obtaining sleep where you feel well rested?&nbsp; Have you tried different vendors? Is meth for you? Are you allowing your fear of nerutoxcity cause anxiety during the high? These are some of the questions you might ask yourself to help you get a better high. <br /><br />Some people don&#039;t like meth that love amph. I think that&#039;s a common misunderstanding that if people enjoy amph they are going to love meth. Some people like to drink beer and others like liqour. That isn&#039;t the best comparison, but it&#039;s the only one i could think of. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				If I need to get shit done, Meth is great for a little extra energy, such as mowing the lawns, cleaning the house or car or if the missuses is up for it and I&#039;m feeling a little buggered!<br />Also if I find myself sometimes in a situation where I really need to concentrate for a sustained period of time, a little meth will do the trick. I don&#039;t do this all the time, only on selective occasions where I am able to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)

I liked the high, I&#039;m just gonna hold on to it until I have something to help me sleep after it. Gonna start chasing my meth with heroin I think.. God that sounds so bad lol. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that anyone can deny that meth isn&#039;t neurotoxic to some degree but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s nearly as bad as I had thought at first. I watched one of Carl Hart&#039;s videos and what he said basically is that meth is no more harmful than amph if used correctly, which makes it almost harmless.. I guess the idea of losing brain cells/decreased cognitive performance just scares me more than anything else.. like if you lose an arm or a leg, you&#039;re still YOU, just handicapped. But if you fuck your brain up you&#039;re not even the same person. And it would be horrible if it was significant compared to the past, knowing you&#039;re not as smart as you used to be and not being able to do anything about it.. flowers for algernon type shit. I know you have to be reckless and binge for a long time to feel that way but it still scares the shit out of me lol<br /><br />Interesting but unrelated article I found on that website: http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/15/why-kids-with-high-iq-are-more-likely-to-take-drugs/

				I&#039;m a weirdo, first and foremost I do meth for rec purposes, I&#039;m not going to pretend i do it for constructive reasons only but it does have a different effect on me than most people, I&#039;m ADHD so it chills me out instead of making me talk a million miles an hour, It is funny because I act like I&#039;m almost on a benzo or a little stoned even though i feel amazing and am high as a kite.

I use meth for rec. purposes and for me, I know there is a time and a place to indulge. I sometimes have days like that where if I&#039;m sitting down and puffing away, watching a movie or some sport, I feel a little stoned on the outside but on the inside, I&#039;m beaming off my nut. It&#039;s like if I have a puff and start doing something like cleaning, I can&#039;t stop moving where as if I puff sitting down and chill, I get an almost lethargic feeling but internally, my mind is buzzing hard.&nbsp; Shit, looking at this makes me feel like a weirdo!!&nbsp; Perhaps I am, but who gives a fuck!!! I don&#039;t. ???

				I stopped on the way home and grabbed some melatonin, diphenahydramine and a bottle of captain and that put me to bed just fine. Had a pretty shitty time at work, definitely noticed my short term memory was fucked all night and woke up still feeling cloudy and burnt out. I guess meth&#039;s just not for me lol, guess I can cross that one off my list.
