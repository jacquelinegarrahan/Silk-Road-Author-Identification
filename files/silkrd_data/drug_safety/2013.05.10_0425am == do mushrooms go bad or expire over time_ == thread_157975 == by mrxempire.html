				Last december I bought a half ounce of mushrooms for someone i work with whos going to take them this summer with some of his friends at a tropical island. Lucky him. The mushies have just been chilling in my room for the past 5 months at normal room temp. Are they still good? He wants to buy them from me soon. Mr.X does not sell faulty product so i just want to make sure

				My friend they are! I&#039;ve had mushrooms for over a year and they&#039;ve still worked, on multiple occasions. I&#039;m a bit of a hoarder and tend to grab a large amount whenever they&#039;re available and by a year or so I do notice a drop in potency from earlier doses in the batch, but nothing half a gram or so couldn&#039;t compensate for. Although I don&#039;t know the length of time between their harvest and your acquisition, I think it&#039;s fair to infer they&#039;re still active.

				I&#039;m thinking of doing some hording at the moment. Am I right in thinking that it helps in maintaining potency if the shrooms are dried? Or are all shrooms that you buy on here dried?<br /><br />Sorry I don&#039;t know much about them.

				I&#039;m pretty sure they don&#039;t have the longest shelf life.&nbsp; If anything they should stay in the fridge.<br /><br />Fresh picked shrooms are the most potent but they need to be dried out so they don&#039;t rot.

				if you keep them shut off from air/sunlight and high temperatures they should not lose much potency over the months. This only counts for shrooms and not truffles (those are sold in the Netherlands mainly, as they are still legal after shrooms got banned there, due to a loophole), they grow bad very fast out of vacuum packaging and without cooling because they are not dry.

				Dry them completely, and put them in an air-tight container (like a glass jar) and they will keep potent for years. I&#039;ve had mine in room temperature over the winter and they didn&#039;t loose any noticeable potency. In the dark and tightly sealed :)<br /><br />dirtybiscuitzz718: Not very smart, no :o Some moulds are very poisonous. Great that you&#039;re still well and that it worked for you :)

				+1 Badniff, they will go horrible if kept wet, even frozen they dont do well, I have tried many ways to keep them as they used to grow on my front lawn!. Dried they keep great. I used to take to Holland to swap for MDMA powder they are very popular over there and were readily available for me, that was when the Dutch still used Guilders for currency though I am talking about Liberty caps as I have no experience with any other types such as cubensis . <br />C

Im glad that it went well, cause i had my mother eat a 1.7 that night also, she vomited pretty much right after taking them, but she chilled with me for a few and pissed her pants a few times laughing, lol.

				Store your shrooms in a cool, dry place and they can last for years, although it&#039;s not recommended, as there will be some potency loss over time. Anything under a year and you&#039;ll be fine though.<br /><br />Powderized shrooms will lose potency faster than whole ones.<br /><br />I stuffed some shrooms in my coat pocket at burning man and found them three years later when I was donating the coat to charity. Ate them and they still worked, for what it&#039;s worth.

				Make sure they are dry! not kinda dry, I mean if you bend them they wont bend AT ALL without snapping in half. Dry like a god damn cracker. DRY MOTHERFUCKER DRY.<br />If you have a vacuum sealer, that would do wonders too, if not, a jar with a few silica packets (they put it in beef jerky packets, says do not eat) If you have a large amount, put it in seal-able Tupperware with a small damp-rid. Most mushrooms people have that &quot;go bad&quot; get mold on them, or something else. If sealed up, mushrooms can stay good and trippy for years.
