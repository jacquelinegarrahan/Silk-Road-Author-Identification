				Does anyone have experience or a strong opinion on mg/ml ratio for preparing heroin #4 into a liquid (saline) solution for both nasal and plugging?&nbsp; (Not with the same syringe ha!)<br /><br />Same drug/liquid ratio or different for each ROA?<br /><br />Fine to just eyeball it, or need to be more precise with mg/ml ratio?<br /><br />Saline vs clean water - any preference?<br /><br />Warm vs cold liquid?<br /><br />Anything I am missing?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Too much obsession on useless detail w/o any hint of intent.<br />Do you want it to be safer,better rush,last longer...<br /><br />Generally,more concentrate,the better for all of that. Distilled water is surprisingly faster/better solvent for Heroin salt&nbsp; than saline solution,and heroin itself in that form is salt.<br />Just use something clean,add heroin,add water (as little as you can) and heat/stir until it&#039;s dissolved for nasal rectal use. <br />As for hygiene,rectal route needs least care,than oral,than nasal,than IV and IM.<br />Last two routes need as much sterility and hygiene possible,including needles,alcohol swab of the skin seconds prior use and clean hands for preparation assuming&nbsp; that heroin is pharma grade pure and sterile itself in unopened vial (which is not case in 99.9% cases),if not,solution needs to be sterilized (by short boiling and a bit of mild acid like vitamin C) and makeshift filters like cotton balls should be sterilized prior use. Preparing No.3 for use is self sterilizing process if your equipment is clean. just make sure you don&#039;t inject some alcohol leftover during sterilization.It can be instantly fatal combo!<br />Makeshift non-sterile filters are No.1 cause of heroin related infections! Even thinking of re-using needles more than for one shot or sharing them is completely suicidal and plain stupid. Even a homeless guy can afford needle every day! <br />IV might tolerate some sloppiness,but IM route demands absolute OCD sterility or might get nasty,crippling gore and is mortally dangerous if not treated asap by doctor. Doctor won&#039;t and should not judge you,he is not police,he saves life,doesn&#039;t ruin them!<br /><br />If you are chasing rush and you are complete opiate virgin,with as concentrated solution as you can make you MIGHT feel 2% of the IV rush using it rectally. Otherwise,there is no difference than morphine. Heroin is carefully re-designed morphine molecule for more comfortable IV use (no nasty histamine effect) and if used in any other way it&#039;s same as morphine,just a bit stronger per gram and less itchy. Using it as opiate of choice for prolonged time always lead to IV use as soon as some tolerance is built and cash starts to drain.<br />On that point 95% people start using IV and 5% go to detox or maintenance program since those are only 2 logical consequences of prolonged use of heroin (or any euphoric IV opiate).<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want IV use to become more than everyday norm,choose more suitable opiate for start with &quot;normal&quot; ROA like Bupe or Tramadol if you have no tolerance. It&#039;s much better,longer lasting,euphoric,safer and cheaper drug than heroin and you have MUCH more time to reconsider quitting before tolerance and dependance kick-in and you becoming slave of your biology and dealer.
