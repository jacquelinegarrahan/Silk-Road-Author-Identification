				Hi <br /><br />It was my 1st experience with coke. I&#039;ve done meth before and wanted to try another stimulant. <br />I went online to research the safe dosage. Some folks in some forum suggested 0.5g as a start. So I placed my order<br /><br />Long story short, I decided to test the water so I snorted nearly half that amount. Felt absolutely nothing!<br />Told myself this shit is completely in-affective. <br /><br />Anyways, I decided to shoot the rest of the powder. <br /><br />Immediately I felt an intense head pressure.. like my brain was expanding and going to pop out of my skull!<br />Then started feeling shortness of breathe. I was terrified.. But was able to calm myself down and focus on breathing. <br />I had an uncontrollable urge to clean my apartment. I was washing the dishes in one hand and vacuum clean with the other. <br /><br />The panic was severe.. thankfully I had some valium pills. They helped returning me back to normal after a battle for around an hour. <br /><br /><br />I want to know whether the dose was too much ? How much should I do next time? I&#039;m a female btw. 170cm tall, 66kg.<br />I also want to know how coke is supposed to make you feel?<br /><br />I felt no euphoria and nothing of the great feeling some users describe. Only an insane cleaning frenzy&nbsp; ???

				Are you sure they didn&#039;t say 0.05g? 500mg in one go is way too much for a first timer, it takes a fair amount of long term use to get to the point where you&#039;d need that much per line.<br /><br />If you did indeed snort 250mg in one go and not feel anything, then what you were sold wasn&#039;t cocaine... did it clog up your nose and not dissolve?

				AMAZED your still alive. You took some white powder you bought off the net and shoot in into your vein. Come on where the fuck is your brain? Snorting small, SMALL amount is one thing when it is not a trusted V, but to do 250mg up the nose feel nothing and then go for the main line is FUCKING NUTS. Please get a grip before you die......

				That&#039;s a lot of coke for a first time. <br />If it was somewhat decent you should have noticed a good effect at 1/5 of that amount aka 100mg.<br /><br />PS: don&#039;t worry about the cleaning frenzy. In the next days you might also feel the urge to stay in the kitchen. That&#039;s nothing to worry about either. Girl, you&#039;ll be a woman soon!

Only an insane cleaning frenzy&nbsp; ???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I inject cocaine when I have access to it, haven;t done it in a months now but quite recently injected crystal meth anyways I think you&#039;ve been scammed and got shit-cocaine or fake cocaine because when you inject it you get ringing in your ears ( a rush so called BELLRINGER) then you get very clean and talkative euphoric feeling for 30mins-1 hour ( I was doing BIG shots and the vendor I bought from sen&#039;t me quality uncut cocaine because I let him know that I IV it and I know different stimulants)/. Then you crash and get very depressed , if you have more cocaine you have an urge to do it ( but after 3-4 GOOD bellringers - man that good that i couldn&#039;t even walk - just was laying on bed incapitated in PURE PLEASURE - stronger than heroin or methamphetamine) I just didn&#039;t want it no more because my head felt worn out and just wanted heroin and go to sleep and call it a day.<br /><br />So if you buy cocaine again advice - good cocaine always disappeared if i brushed it to my skin - had a distinct smell - was oily. I was using as low water as possible in a shot and pushin into a vein as fast as possible for the biggest BANG - from half a gram - already with tolerance - i got about 7-10 good shots. So once again you bought fake cocaine.<br /><br />P.S. When i got a sample from c63amg - I had a bad experience when injecting it but later found out that it was over 70% pure cocaine but with cut CAFFEINE. Well i think IV caffeine ruined the experience, had severe anxiety - same as I get from street powder meth cut with caffeine. So research vendors who sell cocaine without cuts and don&#039;t be naive in doing amounts these big because you will OD.

				100mg line should be plenty for the first one if the Coke is any good, then you can up it from there in subsequent lines depending on how you feel.<br /><br />Whatever you got was definitely not good coke - probably barely coke at all.

				60mg is an amazing first line but 100mg? I&#039;ve done plenty of coke and I never do 100mg lines. If 60mg doesn&#039;t feel great, you got shit coke.

				Thank you all for your comments.<br />To clarify a few things,<br />Yes. I did a quarter of a gram and felt nothing. I forgot to mention that I&#039;m on SNRI (Cymbalta).. dunno if that is relevant. <br />Not sure if it was a shitty coke though, I bought it from one of the highest ranked vendors in where I live. Don&#039;t wanna name him/her, however, the powder I received was white,very fine and smooth, no distinctive smell..Actually no smell at all, didn&#039;t burn or clog up my nose..<br /><br />Also wanted to clarify that there was some time interval between snorting the 1st quarter and shooting the 2nd. Nearly 24 hours. <br />and when I injected the second time I definitely felt it! A LOT actually.. it was insane! So this makes me doubt it was a dodgy powder. <br /><br />Anyways, I made a second order.. and will try the dosage you guys suggested&nbsp; :)

				The actual cocaine itself doesn&#039;t have any smell that we can smell, but the alkaloids or something clearly have a certain smell that I&#039;ve associated with good cocaine even though I know it isn&#039;t the cocaine itself.<br /><br />When I snort cocaine I don&#039;t feel much of anything for a bit but then 15 minutes later I&#039;m either talking a lot of cleaning the house.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never felt a high from it though and I&#039;ve purchased from several SR vendors that are/were well known with good reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re already used to putting out lots of dopamine from meth or adderall or whatever then maybe cocaine doesn&#039;t do as much.<br /><br />I don&#039;t find cocaine all that amazing but it is a good party drug IMHO.
