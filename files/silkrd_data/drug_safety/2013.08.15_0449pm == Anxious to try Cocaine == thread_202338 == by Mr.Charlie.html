				As the title says, I&#039;m a little anxious to buy some cocaine off the Road. I&#039;ve only done (good) coke maybe like three times, only one of those times getting pretty fucked up. I&#039;ve been thinking about getting a gram just to try. My friends all dig it, and last time I tried it I did two little bumps while on some of 3jane&#039;s old but amazing LSD and I went from on top of the world to on top of the galaxy for about an hour. <br /><br />To get to the point, I&#039;m worried that I may fall in love with great cocaine and spend all my extra money on ordering it from the Road. Maybe if I set myself solid limitations of doing it no more than like once every few months?<br /><br /><br />Or am I just being a big pansy about it??<br /><br /><br />Also, post the vendors with best/cheapest cocaine!

				Your concerns are more than valid.&nbsp; Cocaine is a wonderful drug, but the potential for abuse is high as we all know.&nbsp; Do you have an addictive personality?&nbsp; I don&#039;t and I still had a hard time getting my use under control.<br /><br />Good luck tho!

				Just set your limits in advance and stick to them.<br /><br />Cocaine can consume your life if you are not mentally prepared.<br /><br />I&#039;ve watched many people go down this path and it can be scary if you have an addictive personality and free time.

				If you really wanna do coke, I&#039;d suggest limiting yourself to very small purchases at a time. <br />Cocaine is not something that has a high residence time in anyone&#039;s posession.<br />Don&#039;t buy an 8 ball with the hopes that you&#039;ll pace yourself.<br />Stick to small purchases (1/2 g or so) at a time, just enough to have a good weekend but not end up on a nasty binge.<br />Just my 2 cents

				Thanks for the replies guys! I think I&#039;m gonna stick with a half g or G (i&#039;m gonna be sharing it) and just stash it away for my next party. I don&#039;t get down too often, I&#039;m in school full-time and work almost full-time hours as well. <br /><br />But I love having a complete drug collection, and I think some yummy coke would complete it

				in my experience there is no such thing as left over cocaine so stick with small orders. i recently tried high quality coke and found it was the most enjoyable stim ive ever had. still wasn&#039;t that great but im just not a stim fan so take that with a grain of salt.

				I never got around to trying cocaine, and given my personality and memories of college friends blowing through hundreds of bucks in a night, that&#039;s probably a good thing.

				Awesome, again thanks for all the great advice! I&#039;m not a stim guy either so that&#039;s pretty reassuring. I&#039;m really into psychedelics, and I&#039;m a full-blown pothead. Since my life has been becoming increasingly filled with responsibilities I can&#039;t trip that much too often. <br /><br />Thanks for all the help, I&#039;m probably just gonna get a gram to split with like 3-5 other people throughout the night. <br /><br />And yes no drug collection is over complete, but at this point I have MDMA, MDA, LSD, DMT, 2C-B, AL-LAD and like 3 grams of mushrooms that made me lose my mind when I ate 4g like a year ago in the mountains. <br /><br />I feel any more and things just may get a lil crazy one day!<br />

				My personal method is whenever I&#039;m wanting some coke, I take a fat dab of some high quality cannabis concentrates and I completely forget about it. The rush of THC is stupendous and I love it.

				careful with &quot;cocaine&quot; - it is a rare find to get even 30%.<br /><br />btw, if it is a good stuff, you&#039;d never chase it and go crazy, it&#039;s a speed/meth cuts stuff makes you chase.<br /><br />good stuff makes you nice warm and peaceful kind of good citizen.

				You tried it, there&#039;s nothing more to discover man.<br />Coke is mostly illusion.<br />Stick to shit that can help you in your life - mainly psychedelics, <br />some MDMA every couple months <br />and cannabis<br /><br />Peace out
