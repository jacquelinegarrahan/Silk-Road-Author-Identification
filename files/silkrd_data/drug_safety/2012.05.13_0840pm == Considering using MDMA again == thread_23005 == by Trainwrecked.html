				Okay, so I&#039;ve been a hardcore fan of rolling and tripping.&nbsp; Been for years (MDMA for over a year now and LSD for 2, shrooms for 5 years)&nbsp; I encountered a real problem last year with MDMA.&nbsp; I was rolling every weekend and tripping every weekend for about a year and I got so bad, I started to eat insane amounts of MDMA.&nbsp; For instance, I would eat over a g and a half of pure MDMA in a 24 hour period.&nbsp; Since I noticed my problem with it, I quit.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t touched it in like 4 months.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to start using MDMA again, but I don&#039;t want to develop a problem with it.&nbsp; I LOVE LSD, but I don&#039;t get the opportunity to enjoy it near as much as I used to and the market is terrible for LSD now too (so impossible to find compared to MDMA).&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to start using MDMA again but I don&#039;t want to develop a problem.&nbsp; Any advice?

				Hmm. I think if you still think you can fall back into a problem with it and it&#039;s only been four months, you should just keep waiting it out. It kind of sounds like you just miss it a lot. Doing it that much as such a daily routine is hard to let go. It&#039;s like talking to someone every single day for hours and hours and then all of a sudden just stopping that. Who the hell do you talk to now?

				I do miss it a lot.&nbsp; Considerably.&nbsp; I miss how happy I felt, how it increased my energy and sexual drive.&nbsp; Helped me open up more with others too.&nbsp; It&#039;s just such an amazing drug.

				I know many heads who used to do a lot of E and now are clinically depressed. That stuff will burn you out and cause damage. Take it easy, even every weekend is a lot.

				The trick is being able to treat M like other fine things in life: a dinner at a nice restaurant, a fancy bottle of your favorite liquor, going to see a show. These things bring you tons of happiness but they&#039;re generally done sparingly. If you can&#039;t do that with M, don&#039;t do it. 4 months doesn&#039;t seem like long enough of a time to get yourself to a point where you can treat it as something that you do periodically.

				I imagine the OP as one of the guys i see at dubshit events with his pupils rolled around in his head looking like a zombie. I have more fun laughing at those guys than i do with the drugs half the time.

				I actually have only rolled at two raves, and that was when I first started doing it.&nbsp; Only took one at each lol.&nbsp; I did it every weekend with my gf, and we mostly laid around the bedroom and connected and bonded.&nbsp; I was never really that good at opening up, and it helped me open up to her considerably.&nbsp; Then I started using it around friends to grow closer to them too.&nbsp; Next thing I knew, I wasn&#039;t feeling it, it seemed.&nbsp; So I started to take more.&nbsp; Next thing I know, I&#039;d wake up the next day to realize there&#039;s 2 gs of molly gone from my stash.&nbsp;

				Shit goes missing from my stash all the fucking time. In my circle of friends if you leave it lieing around its fair game. I must have a collection of about 150 clippers.

				Nah, nobody was stealing from my stash lol.&nbsp; I was eating it.&nbsp; Never gave anyone the opportunity to steal my shit lol.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not like I&#039;d just pass out at some party either.&nbsp; I&#039;d end up home, passing out with just me and my gf, and wake up and notice just how much I ate.&nbsp; I don&#039;t realize it when I&#039;m rolling cause all I think about when I&#039;m starting to come down is pop another capsule, to keep it going.&nbsp; Cause when I do it, I wanna feel the effects all day long, not just for a few hours.

				It is quite easy to crave sometimes, especially on a comedown when you realize you&#039;re losing such a great feeling. I keep a good few weeks between my rolls because I don&#039;t feel quite normal after I take it. Other drugs such as weed can help with the cravings, certainly did for me. Were you using different drugs (other than LSD) when you were binging? I wouldn&#039;t advise you taking MDMA again but that&#039;s your choice. Other drugs might take your mind off it - or you could just say balls to it and do it anyway

				Eh, I didn&#039;t really combine drugs too much while binging.&nbsp; Did K a few times while on molly, and MXE a couple times.&nbsp; I&#039;d trip the day after rolling, or the day before.&nbsp; Never both at once.&nbsp; I usually like to keep my drugs separate.&nbsp; Instead of just getting straight fucked up, I like to enjoy each drug separately.&nbsp; Each drug has it&#039;s distinct feeling that is enjoyable on it&#039;s own.&nbsp; Although, combining K, MXE, and nitrous (NOT ALL AT ONCE) to MDMA is incredible.&nbsp; That I won&#039;t lie about.&nbsp;
