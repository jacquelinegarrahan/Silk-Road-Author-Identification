				Nicotine is a unique drug as it enhances both concentration OR relaxation.<br />It is the only addictive drug I was not able to quit.<br />Surf around a little. I came across reports that say it was only a matter of days to quit smoking successfully and it is suspected that cigarette makers add chemicals since the late 50s/early 60s.<br />Lung cancer has only exploded since then too although a much bigger percentage of people smoked then.<br />Interesting sidenote: The army lets you smoke on the frontline as much as I know.<br />

				It&#039;s a mild stimulant that is immensely addictive.<br /><br />When you have no tolerance to it you actually get a buzz.&nbsp; Though too much and you will get sick and feel woozy like mentioned above.<br /><br />Of course with any drug, once you develop a tolerance you never get the same buzz and by that point you&#039;re just smoking to make your self feel normal.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same concept with heroin addiction.<br /><br />However, first cigarette of the day such as the morning or when you are really tired and smoke one you feel relaxed and awake for a brief moment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I smoke because I am addicted and I am fully aware it is really killing me slowly.&nbsp; It is so hard to quit.&nbsp; It is especially bad because I have bad anxiety and the habit of smoking when I&#039;m anxious became a part of me.&nbsp; It is a horrible habit on top of the addiction that will be extremely hard to beat.

				Naturally grown and cured tobacco (i.e. your own homegrown) is probably not nearly as bad as commercially produced cigarettes. I believe I was reading somewhere the tricks tobacco manufacturers use to make the cigarettes more addictive but I forget the details now.

				It&#039;s a mild stimulant that makes you feel sick.<br /><br />When we are addicted to it we claim the drug has all manner of wonderful relaxational and calming properties. I doesn&#039;t though, we are merely in denial. ::)<br /><br />&nbsp;Having said that it does relax the addict, but only insofar as smoking ceases our condition of drug withdrawal (which promotes high anxiety) and therefore returns us to baseline which is perceived as relaxing/calming.<br /><br />absolutely terrible pointless drug, and one I was addicted to for many many years, ugh

				I&#039;ve smoked four cigarettes in my lifetime, but I was always too drunk to discern their effects from that of the liquor. I was also confused that I had no cravings the next day- I&#039;d somehow been convinced that after smoking one cigarette you&#039;d become a pack-a-day addict, despite knowing that DARE had lied to me about many other substances.<br /><br />To be honest, given the health concerns I don&#039;t see why anybody would willingly take up the habit of cigarettes. The psychological effects just don&#039;t seem intense enough to warrant damaging my body. Inhaling and exhaling smoke is fun (at least for me, albeit Freud would&#039;ve diagnosed me as being orally fixated) but there are healthier substances to do so with.<br /><br />I will say that an ecig I tried tasted absolutely fantastic and left a great sensation in my mouth, but again, I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s worth the bodily harm.<br /><br />I do have one curiosity- does the cigarette &#039;high&#039; come from the substance itself, or from satisfying ones&#039; addiction to them?

				I am in the minority that smokes every day, but very lightly.&nbsp; Less than 5 cigarettes per day on average, easy.&nbsp; I have smoked heavier in the past.&nbsp; I am a long time nicotine addict, but not really much of an abuser.<br /><br />My .000002 BTC:<br /><br />The ritual is paramount.&nbsp; No matter what kind of smoker you are considering, the ritual act of removing yourself from the situation and fixing/lighting tobacco is a huge ritual, and has inherent value.&nbsp; This bleeds into the &quot;social&quot; element of smoking with other people, trying to get laid, breaking the ice, etc.<br /><br />Man make fire.&nbsp; There is something that satisfies at a primal level when you burn that tree.&nbsp; Cigar and cannabis aficionados can back me up here.<br /><br />There are clearly psychotropic effects.&nbsp; To me, what immediately comes to mind are:&nbsp; satisfying the addict&#039;s craving, and increased focus on short term tasks.&nbsp; These are both clearly backed up in the medical literature and pretty easy to understand.<br /><br />There is no significant intoxication.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons for its popularity and abuse over history.<br /><br />I once posed a similar question to a friend:&nbsp; if nicotine is a stimulant, why are cigarettes &quot;relaxing&quot;?&nbsp; He replied:&nbsp; try getting up from your desk, walking outside, and taking 10-20 deep breaths and see how you feel.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is a very good response!<br /><br />If I had a child, I would hate to see him/her smoking tobacco every day, but at the same time the recent demonization of tobacco has me on the resistance side currently.<br /><br />Look up David Sedaris and Bill Hicks - they both had good riffs on tobacco (before they quit LOL).<br /><br />

				Nicotine is a bit of a drug in its own class. Smoking is extremely addictive, but the effects are very mild. Most smokers are fine operating motor vehicles and/or heavy machinery while smoking. <br /><br />On the short term smoking really is an addiction with few to no negative effects. On the long run it causes problems like cancer, but that is often too far ahead to consider. <br /><br />Personally i ejjoy smoking - the feeling, the taste, the ristual. In recent years i suppose i also enjoy the response from nonsmokers, though i preferred the situation where we all got a long in the 90s :)

				Read the Wikipedia articles on Tobacco and Nicotine. They describe a huge effect on your brain from smoking tobacco as it releases a lot of chemicals in the brain when smoked. A key thing to note - it changes its behavior based on how it&#039;s smoked. It sounds elementary, but shorter drags make you stimulated, whereas longer and slower drags relax you.

				It&#039;s complicated, and the people who write about these things are generally very drug-naive; you&#039;ll probably get better info here than anywhere.<br /><br />There is a dopaminergic and a serotonergic angle on it, but that&#039;s pretty minor.&nbsp; You want dopamine, do a line.&nbsp; I think the cholinergic angle is what most people are looking for.&nbsp; Enhanced memory, clarity of thought.<br /><br />It is a highly effective anti-anxiety agent.&nbsp; People with certain types of agitated depression can&#039;t live without nicotine.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only anti-anxiety agent that improves your capacity (ie doesn&#039;t&nbsp; bomb you out of your head).<br /><br />People constantly under-estimate nicotine.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great drug.&nbsp; That&#039;s why it&#039;s addictive.&nbsp; Number one reason people can&#039;t quit smoking is because there really isn&#039;t a substitute for what nicotine does, imho.&nbsp; &nbsp; Interestingly, the vaping community embraces this idea. They quit smoking because of the ill effects of combustion products, but have absolutely no intention of giving up the nicotine.<br /><br />To be clear, people who choose to use nicotine are dancing with the devil.&nbsp; Ya makes yer choices.&nbsp;

				Worth noting: Nicotine *itself* is not terribly addictive. Surprise!<br /><br />However, the addiction comes from the MAOIs in tobacco that function with the nicotine which make it behaviorally addictive. That&#039;s why I believe e-cigs are so far less addicting than smoked tobacco, because they lack the MAOIs.

				Nicotine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, acting more like a nerve agent than any recreational drug. Besides the pro-cholinergic effects of nicotine, tobacco has other alkaloids (whole tobacco alkaloids) such as anabasine, antabasine, nornicotine, and harman. Some of these have a similar mechanism to nicotine and one acts as a reversable MAOI (specifically RIMA). Some tobacco alkaloids modulate D2 transport and mu-opioid transmission. Tobacco is quite a mixed bag of pharmacology and other substances are responsible for addiction other than just nicotine.

				Wait... Cigarettes have a MAOI in them?<br /><br />Is this a MAOI of the intensity where you&#039;d have to be concerned about your MDMA intake / DXM intake / cheese intake?

				Yes tobacco does contain an MAOI but you do not have to worry about hypertensive crisis because it is a RIMA and a mild one at that. The MAOI is called Harman.<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764332

				I&#039;m still interested in how this interaction would actually work. <br /><br />I&#039;ve found that taking nicotine orally or using a vaporizer like an electronic cigarette is not quite as nice as smoking an actual cigarette, despite the doses being the same, or even higher for the replacement. <br /><br />Would you presume that taking oral nicotine in combination with a low dose of a common MAOI like nardil would approach the effect of a proper cigarette more, or is this purely a psychological thing with lighting cigarettes?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure its not -just- the ritual, i&#039;ve tried ultra-light cigarettes that deliver no nicotine to speak off (&lt;0.1 mg each) and those certainly do very little for me.
