				Some of 3Jane&#039;s MDA has arrived. I&#039;ve never tried it before so I&#039;m going to do a bit by itself next weekend.<br />I&#039;m interested to hear peoples experiences with mixing MDA with MDMA. Do you need to take a full dose of both or like 70 mg of each?&nbsp; Do they potentiate each other? Do you take them simultaneously or do one after the comeup of the other like when mixing 2C-B with MDMA? <br />How intense are the visuals on normal doses- are they like a hefty dose of mushrooms or just subtle wibbling?<br /><br />I know there&#039;s stuff on bluelight, erowid etc but I detect a lot of bullshit in 90% of those trip reports...

				Hey,<br /><br />sorry I can&#039;t help with your MDA question... <br /><br />But, I&#039;m curious about the MDMA / 2c-b combo. What dose would you recommend? <br /><br />Thanks!

				Do not take a full dose of each.&nbsp; They are very very similar and have huge overlap.&nbsp; The ratio of one to the other that you take depends on what you desire, but the combined dose of both together should equal about the same dose as one by itself.

				328502E- have you tried the combo? My usual dose of MDMA is about 130 mg with a 40 mg booster 90 mins after come up.<br /><br />RidingAround- It usually takes about 70-80 minutes for me to come up on 2C-B. What I do is take the MDMA + booster dose as above, then take the 2C-B about an hour after the booster dose. You then come up on the 2C-B when the plateau of the MDMA starts to tail off, quite a smooth transition. I take between 16-20 mg of 2C-B. Personally, I like to take Goldilocks doses of drugs when going out with friends- I hate getting so fucked up that I forget the experience or end up being unsociable.

				when I was taking MDMA MDA mix I was making 30-40 mg MDA and 60-70 MDMA keeping that 100 mg dose. I ended up taking 310 mg of Juergens MDMA and 90 of Dopeboys MDA. I had an extra 100 mg of mdma, wish I had more MDA! lol

				Thanks guys, I&#039;ll start with 80 mg MDA, then 80 mg MDMA after 1 hour. I&#039;m interested in how the visuals pan out over the 70-180 mg dose range. I&#039;ll update soon :) Can&#039;t believe how little info there is about this combo!<br />Stormtropper420- were there any visuals at 90mg MDA?
