				As the title suggests I am looking for a good simple recipe for mushroom tea and I searched the forums and couldn&#039;t find a very good one along with Erowid&#039;s recipes seem to require whole mushrooms when the ones I&#039;ll have will be ground up.

				I&#039;m no expert but I&#039;m pretty sure you can use the same amount of ground up shrooms as you would with whole ones.

				yea def the same rules of physics apply, weight is weight. since youve got mush powder, you will def need some coffee filters, unless you dont mind drinking down the soggy gross mush powder. let the water boil then let it simmir till its hardly HOT you want it as warm as it can be but not hot, add mushys, stir for like ten min, then let sit for like five more then stir again, then strain the mushys thru coffee filters. be sure to ring out the excess mush water using the coffee filters.&nbsp; then add tea bags of your choice , some fresh lemons or lemon juice and your golden. the ratio i use is like a minimum of 3-4 grams per 8ox of water. but you work with what you have, just dont expect to trip balls off an eighth brewed into two cups of tea. Goodluck!

				I like to steep the shrooms for about 5 minutes<br />Add a tea bag (I like a light tea chrysanthemum or white) let it sit for another 2-3<br />filter out your shroom dust with a coffee filter (or drink it, its not that bad...)<br />Add honey to taste.<br />I personally don&#039;t like lemon teas as they make my teeth feel weird, but that&#039;s just me.<br />

				Water over 80 degrees will kill psilocin so I whip out my handy dandy candy thermometer and set it in the cup I&#039;m about to use. I too use whole homegrown mushies but as someone already explained take a coffee filter and put the mushies in the middle. I wouldn&#039;t sift it through, rather just fold up the coffee filter like a christmas present and staple in the center so as not to lose any powder. I boil my water, place in about a teaspoon of a herbal tisane (any herbal tea containing no caffeine is prime, my stomach gets upset from mushies so I stay away from the green teas and what have you) and stir. From 100 degrees down to 80 will take about 5 min, just long enough to steep your &quot;non-psychedelic&quot; tea bag. Looking at your handy dandy thermometer you can toss in your mush. Like I said I always use whole mushrooms so I ATTACK them with a spoon (brutally) till I am sure I have pressed and poked as much as possible. Stirring regularly (because it&#039;s in a &quot;teabag&quot;) the brew will be ready in about 10 minutes. You will metabolize the psilocin much faster in this liquid form and in turn will have a shorter come up and a shorter high. With a group of people we usually use more mushrooms and this same method to make a pot of tea, then just dole out shots in little tea cups , and enjoy!<br />Note: I have done salvia, dmt, over 500 ug of lsd at once, but mushrooms have still fucked me up MORE than anything else I have ever done so be cautious when dosing, specially because it&#039;s much easier to over do it with shots of tea.
