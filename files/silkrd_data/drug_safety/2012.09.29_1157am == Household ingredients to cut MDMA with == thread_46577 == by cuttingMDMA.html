				Hey, I am going to cut my MDMA. its gonna happen so dont tell me not to.<br /><br />I want to know what inert substance you can find in most households that really look like the following:<br /><br />1) powdery tan MDMA<br />2) powdery pure white MDMA<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking icing sugar, salt, baking soda for the white MDMA, but what about for the tan? Crushed brown sugar? Wholemeal flour?<br /><br />It needs to look like a tan powder thats all. Suggestions welcomed thanks.<br /><br />And yes, I am selling this MDMA to a real douchebag so I really dont care about the ethics of cutting it, but I want his customers to be safe so I need inert substance suggestions thanks.

				The only thing you should ever cut MDMA with is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine :)<br />Trust me on this, they&#039;ll never know you&#039;ve cut it ;)

				I can&#039;t imagine this happens a lot with MDMA crystals which are quite distinct looking and tasting. You&#039;d know the second it was on your tongue that it had brown sugar in it. <br /><br />Also, if you cut, you are everything that&#039;s wrong with street dealers. If you want to be a dick to him just charge him more, same result with less effort.

				Please dont cut your MDMA! If you are in the US i think the profit is more than enough to justify not cutting it.<br /><br />That is also one of the beauties of SR, you know what you are getting is pure and you can pass that purity and safety that comes along with it onto your customers.<br /><br />Dont be a dickhead.<br /><br />but you are probably going to cut it anyways, stay safe

				Really? You&#039;re that inept you need to make a post looking for advice on how to cheat people? You&#039;re obviously small time so what do you gain from cutting this guys MDMA, .5g, maybe a few? If you do go down this road, I hope you keep it up and maybe one day you&#039;ll rip off the wrong person and wind up getting your head smashed in with a trash can.

Something like lactose is a good filler because it has little to no taste of itself, and is harmless to most&nbsp; people. Mineral supplement tablets can also work as they come in both bright white and tan, and usually have little taste. Downside its they have a noticeable texture.

				I like to cut my pills with a razor.<br /><br />Seriously though, first off, if this guy is a douche then he will probably cut the stuff. All the more reason for you to NOT cut it. First off do you really want to punish his customers and secondly, if he has no customers then he will not buy from you.<br /><br />If you HAVE to cut it then dont go for more than 10%.<br />Try ground up rock rock sugar, it will look proper but it will taste wrong.
