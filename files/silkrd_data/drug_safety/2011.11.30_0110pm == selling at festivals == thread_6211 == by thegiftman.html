				I would say avoid bathrooms and do not sell to any older looking people. Do not let girls try to scam you. Possibly walk through a crowd as you are selling. <br /><br />Just observations from what I have seen. Be careful. Cops should be out catching real criminals but they just want to ruin the fun.

				I wouldn&#039;t keep it all on you at once. Maybe Sell in one spot and then go back to your stash and get more. Either way it&#039;s sketchy as fuck because everyone is a stranger. I personally wouldn&#039;t so it.

				start with a high price and be ready to take a lower one.<br /><br />Eye contact usually means someone is selling, or buying. Stare people in the eyes, if they keep looking, go talk to them.<br /><br />Shit, you might get a blow job this way. <br /><br />If something seems sketch, just leave immediately. <br /><br />If possible, never initiate the buy. Wording is important.<br /><br /><br />

				It depends on the festival. It&#039;s not that hard to figure out how to sell to people if its the type of festival where there are 0 cops in attendance (and these festivals still exist out there :)) But at a normal festival with lots of cops around, I wouldn&#039;t do it at all. I&#039;ve seen many people get rolled (both strangers and good friends) mid party. It&#039;s definitely NOT FUN to go to jail fucked up on acid (or whatever you do for that matter... unless you like attending festivals sober...) Plus there are tons of narcs and you don&#039;t know who they may be. But if you are going to sell to anyone, i would try to get a vibe from them and see if they are there to fucking party.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn&#039;t do it. It&#039;s WAYYY too fucking risky in my opinion, but if you are going to, I wish you good luck.

				Just wanted to point out that you may want to use a different account for this sort of thing. As a potential customer I&#039;m a bit put off and I think most of us would prefer a vendor to be more risk averse. <br /><br />Otherwise you&#039;ve been doing everything right and if you keep it up hopefully you won&#039;t need to be considering &#039;old school&#039; distribution in the future.

				Back in the day we had many friends that would sell at festivals like TwoTribes etc..<br /><br />Now, it&#039;s a different story.<br /><br />LE has ramped up efforts at all well known festivals and there are many undercovers doing buy busts within the venue. They also have sniffer dogs stationed out the front of the festival.<br /><br />thegiftman - I think it&#039;s a wise choice to not do this, it&#039;s just compromising yourself for not much gain either. I think you are doing a good job here with the MDMA :)

				Alright OP, some of these people&#039;s opinions are valid, but let me give you some insight from first hand experience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve sold a shi-fuckton of all sorts of things, at all sorts of venues. Someone early said to let them initiate the buy - a rule I try to follow all the time. Word will spread, to the RIGHT people. Just start off by having a good time, going a little nuts. Sometimes people who see that will straight up ask you where the shit&#039;s at. Alternatively, just go around to people and &quot;fish&quot; for an inquiry.... for example: you: &quot;hey man, you rollin??&quot; other guy: &quot;Ah, shit man, I wish!!&quot; you:&quot;well, i Got an extra tab or two...&quot; Easy as pie.

				only certain festivals u can sell it. you can&#039;t sell at things like ULTRA or ALLGOOD festival because of insane amounts of security. BONNAROO is a different story. u can sell there, but of course always go for the most obvious looking hippie. look for dread, tie dye t-shirts, people smoking weed pretty much something that can narrow the list of whether or not they are a cop. also if somebody ask you for something and u feel skteched out ask them to smoke weed. if they smoke there not a cop if they don&#039;t tell them sorry and i think your looking for someone else. what festival are you going to if you don&#039;t mind me asking? if you dont want to answer because u find it to be sensitive information then just do research on the festival and see new reports. there is always atleast one new report talking about level of security and city compliance(allgood sucks because all the people that live there hate hippies which is why all good has the highest level of security of all festivals)

				I know someone who got busted by an undercover with dreads. My advice is stick to the campgrounds and if the festival doesn&#039;t have them then don&#039;t sell. I never have seen anyone in the thick of campgrounds get busted. Just walk by not following the path and when you see a GROUP of people at their site they are obviously not just a group of LE smoking a J so go hit them up and see what they need.

Wow, never woulda thought..<br /><br />I don&#039;t normally sell at shows, but if i have extras and/or need some gas money to get back home from the show I&#039;ll sell a little. I&#039;m a pretty social guy and i usually talk to a lot of people at a show. If I&#039;m selling, sometime during the conversation when I&#039;m confident they&#039;re cool I&#039;ll just mention I have an extra cap or two, or my buddy has a few left over. <br /><br />The campsite hopping thing works too, I&#039;ve got some good stuff (T-shirts and drugs) off cool dudes who were just hopping campsite to campsite selling their wares to cool people.

				I don&#039;t have experience with buying or selling, but I do have a little bit of experience bumming. And it&#039;s harder to freeload than it is to buy.<br />I agree with JohnnyFried on his points, and would like to add a few of my own.<br /><br />First and foremost, enjoy the fest. Don&#039;t just stand still being sketch looking for people, that&#039;s the easiest way to scare off potential buyers.<br />Move around the crowd! Dance around and enjoy the music, while keeping an eye out for someone who&#039;s got that look in their eye. Like they&#039;re having a good time, but they&#039;re kind of looking for a better time. If someone makes eye contact with you and they&#039;re smiling, smile back and start a conversation. Ask if they&#039;re having a good time, and if they seem right, ask if they&#039;re looking for something. Wording can be really important. Don&#039;t just go up to someone asking if they&#039;re looking for acid or ecstasy. Ease into it, and see if they&#039;ll say what they&#039;re looking for. Personally, I can find someone who&#039;s cool and ask them if they know where I can find some molly.<br />People will often ask, if they&#039;re looking. If you wait long enough, people will come to you.<br />Try to gauge people&#039;s behavior around you. Look around the crowd and find the people who just feel right. Maybe some people can&#039;t tell the way I can, but I can just be able to watch someone for a while to determine if they&#039;re on something, if they&#039;re wishing they were on something, or if they are up-tight. Maybe I&#039;d make a good distributor at medium sized local shows... heh.<br />When making a deal, don&#039;t try to sneak off to a corner. Be in the crowd with people on all sides of you. Make sure there aren&#039;t any stern faces around (potential LE), and be discreet. If you need to ask how to be discreet, maybe you shouldn&#039;t be considering selling.<br />After making a deal with someone, tell them to tell their friends. You get a good bit of business from word of mouth. Don&#039;t ever underestimate it.<br /><br />While dealing at large shows can definitely be risky, someone in the crowd is doing it. If they can pull it off, so can you.<br />Just BE CAREFUL! And make sure if you have people you&#039;re with, they&#039;re keeping an eye out.<br /><br />Good luck with whatever you do,<br />~Toker

				When I sell at clubs, I take a pack of cigarettes, empty a little tobacco from the end, then insert a roll into the empty end of the cigarette. That way it just looks like someone is buying a few cigarettes.

				read and listen to what others have posted. and to the person that said just don&#039;t sell to older people, that is kinda fucked up, they like to party too, BUT, there are kids out there with dreads that work for the man, seen it, be careful. And those &quot;stern&quot; faces most definitely could be the heat.&nbsp; Also, if people know you are swinging they will often try to break into your car or tent to rip you off,&nbsp; let the folks you are traveling with know so they don&#039;t get ripped off also. And don&#039;t get too far off they beaten path cause as mentioned you can get rolled (robbed) at a music event, dark forces and bad energy can be present. be as safe as you can, and don&#039;t get to complacent. Get your work done and enjoy the music and people!!!

				Coming from a pretty experienced raver and show goer I would avoid selling at an event entirely.<br /><br />Even if you&#039;re not particularly worried about undercover simply the stress of bringing illegal substances to the show would worry me.<br /><br />Also if you are caught selling or distributing you will likely be asked to leave and probably be arrested on the spot. <br /><br />Kind of playing the devil&#039;s advocate but please stay safe and avoid distributing drugs on festival or show grounds. These situations can be dangerous enough for certain drug users already.&nbsp;

				I love the campground vendors at festivals.&nbsp; Got to chatting up a guy at All Good a few years ago in the campground, after chatting for awhile we mentioned we were pissed we couldn&#039;t find coke to bring with us.&nbsp; He said hey I&#039;ll come back around I brought some to sell.&nbsp; He did come back and the shit was tight (for real best random coke I ever bought) stuff was so good we were geeking out a little just from snorting while watching les claypool.&nbsp; Man I was hoping we&#039;d see that guy again but never did......

				With the security in the actual festivals, these days I wouldn&#039;t bother trying to sell at the festival, maybe the campsite - but get there before the festival starts and hide most of your drugs well away from where you are selling, for day festivals, I would be selling at the pubs around the area, let the buyers worry about getting it in.<br /><br />Oh for the days of the early big day out, just sold buckets of speed at the site, a mate even wore a T-shirt saying drug dealer, the few police laughed, but got enough enquiries and eventually were doing a rawing trade, but these days drug dogs everywhere to get in.&nbsp; And the kids are so young, dont know what they are doing - sure to get busted.<br /><br />Better set up a Vendor account and sell festival packs, a ticket with their choice of drug. Hey thats not a bad idea. 8)<br /><br />

				How hard is it to bring personal amounts of drugs to festivals these days? I haven&#039;t been to any big ones yet. They just gave me a lite pat down which was a joke since i snuck a small bottle of booze and a pipe.

				Most events/shows I go to, they&#039;ll pat you down lightly and check for drinks and weapons. I was asked to either chug or throw away a redbull that I had in pocket. I downed that shit in less than 10 seconds, it was kind of cool.<br />They&#039;ll prolly pat your front pockets, check your waistband and torso, and maybe down your legs.<br />Depending on the place, they probably are only concerned about weapons getting in.

My main concern when going to festivals with drugs, is the cops on the way there. <br />Most of the time people at the gate of the festival just go through your car to make sure you have alcohol (if they don&#039;t allow outside alc.) or sneaking someone in the trunk.<br /><br />I used to go to a Grateful Dead tribute festival that was known for being pretty wild, and the cops always had a checkpoint on the highway leading to the property. <br /><br />A lot of times we&#039;d get a jar of peanut butter, double bag the drugs, stash em in the peanut butter, and put the paper seal back on with super glue.
