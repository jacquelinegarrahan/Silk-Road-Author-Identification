				i know this this big dealer round here who sells whole sale .. some one very trustworthy to me has told me his crack is synthesized and is made from pharmaceuticals .. i believe my friend, not only because i trust him .. also because this guys whole sale prices are insanely cheap .. and i know he does not have connections with big manufacturers from south America etc .. i have spoken to a med student who specializes in chemistry his opinion .. he said he could also do it but he wont and wont teach me either .. now i know there is a chem student somewhere in SR that can help me and a lot of other people here .. if your that person please tell&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinone, converting the<br />tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as methyl-tropan-3-one-2-<br />carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine, and changing that to cocaine.<br />

				He is probably selling a compound with similar effects.&nbsp; No way to synthesize cocaine and sell it at the price cocaine commands, atleast not worth the trouble.&nbsp; I know of compounds which are easy to make that are almost exactly like coke but a) cost pennies on the dollar and b) are actually legal.&nbsp; I sell chemistry consulting services.

				OP, use your brain mate. If it were cheaper to synthesise cocaine than to extract it from coca leaves then that is where cocaine would come from. Until jameslink posted I hadn&#039;t known synthetic coke existed, although I suppose if I&#039;d given it a little thought, theoretically any chemical made in nature can be recreated by clever chemists. I don&#039;t doubt your freind is trustworthy, he just has bad information. If there were precursor chemicals that could easily be turned to cocaine by skilled chemists, then they would be controlled and difficult to get hold of. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This big wholesaler is probably cutting his coke with one of these cheap &#039;similar&#039; synthetic stimulants that DDWv2 mentions. Every few months a new analogue stimulant appears which claims to be&nbsp; just like coke or ecstasy. Stimulants and RCs aren&#039;t really my thing but I have the impression that they never quite live up to their hype. Shit, if someone synthesised a proper substitute for coke that cost penny&#039;s on the dollar it would be fucking huge!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m afraid your dream of knocking up some pure crack on your kitchen stove just isn&#039;t gonna happen; unless you have the pure coke and some ammonia to rock it up with!

				thanks for your comments guys, and hungry ghost i guess ur right, i should&#039;ve specified, he&#039;s making crack on the cheap and i mean TOO FUCKIN CHEAP .. my source tells me he&#039;s using synthesized coke or a substitute to replace it .. i cant get my head round the latter part of his accusation .. nyway what do i know, i&#039;m no chemist, jus wanted to see if anyone new how to do it .. and i&#039;ve got the ammonia my friend jus need to find good coke that wont disapear soon as it touches liquid lol .. also need to get a wholesaler who&#039;ll give a good price .. havn&#039;t found 1 on SR or outside yet .. but aint givin up yet ;-)

				In theory any substance that occurs in nature can be made synthetically, or at least by cultured micro-organisms or plants. In case of cocaine, the simplest route would be to simply grow coca plants similar to how people grow cannabis. <br /><br />There is a purely synthetic route to cocaine and atropine though, so if you want to avoid working with plants, it is possible to do. <br /><br />Getting from tropinone to cocaine or atropine isn&#039;t even the hard part though - getting the tropinone is. It is not a chemical you can just buy from the average lab supplier at all. <br /><br />Essentially the reaction requires that you begin with some 7-C ringed compound (cycloheptane) and buld from there on. You can also start from succinaldehyde and methylamine. Both processes require numerous steps to yield tropinone The overall yield will be low after all the reaction steps, making it less attractive compared to trafficked cocaine in general. <br />

				I have used synthetic coke on many occasions! its whats sold in most of the coke bars where I live.. it sucks and always burns and tastes like shit but it gets the job done.. so i know its real (synthetic coke) but I also know its the mob who controls it here (there prolly the only ones with enough money to make it)... from what I hear the have chemists making it up all over.. <br /><br />just so you know!<br /><br />

				When you say synthetic coke do you mean actual cocaine or some stimulant that is being sold as coke. Surely if it was actual cocaine it could be reacted, freebased, in the same way? I&#039;m no chemist but that makes sense to me?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Jonjon, your friendly and polite response to my post made me ashamed of my slightly rude attitude and I apologise.

				Good show, Hungry Ghost. +1 for your contrition. I&#039;m impressed at how many people on these forums continue to talk in a civilized manner and are actually able to be honest with themselves.

				Oh I&#039;m sorry. I though I was allowed to divulge any info I want.

He used to RUN shit here with his son and father both were assassinated while he was locked up.<br /><br />I&#039;m assume that most prolly he had something to do with these last two shootings and is trying to make way for his return.. but hey ... thats just speculation...<br /><br />But if i were him and my dad and son were gunned down while i was locked up and now I&#039;m returning home i&#039;d want to take it all back ... especially when the bikers are not so much in the picture... now all he has to deal with is the street gangs..<br /><br /><br />its for sure fucked up over here, we no doubt have the most corrupt officials in quebec out of all of canada and that plays a big role in the underworld here!

				Synthetic cocaine is identical to the product obtained from coca leaves, so there should be no reason dismiss it straight out.<br /><br />I think i should point out that this situation is different from the one with &#039;synthetic cannabis&#039; which usually contains substances that are not identical to those obtained from cannabis plants, although their effects may be very similar. <br /><br />Synthetic routes towards many substances that exist in nature exist, and in this case its bascially the process used in pharma industry to synthesize atropine, but with the final steps modified to yield cocaine instead. <br /><br />As far as topic starters fishing for ideas: my attitude towards that is not negative. Going from a theoretically sound concept to a practical setup is a huge leap, and i respect anyone that makes that happen. This is not a process of adding A, B and C in a bottle and stirring it for good luck. The synthesis route is in fact rather complex and the chances of anyone without a solid background in organic chemistry performing it successfully all the way are slim to none. If you do happen to find a practical process that starts from cycloheptanone to cocaine the only thing i can show is respect - i doubt i could do that with a yield over 1% myself even given a lot of time to tinker with every step.

				Sure, it&#039;s *possible* to make cocaine synthetically, though it&#039;s no walk in the park. It&#039;s just next to impossible to do it profitably, and would be a pathetic percentage of the profit made through plant-derived cocaine. Plus, the added risk of finding sources for bulk amounts of suspicious chemicals. Your guy&#039;s most likely selling some junk with similar effects. Otherwise, he&#039;s an intern somewhere that made a horrible business decision o.O.

				Doing it profitably is the problem indeed. I have no doubt that it would be possible to synthesize cocaine at a fraction of its street price. <br /><br />This would, however, require an enormous investment (think big pharma factory), and since it is illegal, this plant could be seized before the first gram is sold. Purchase of any precursor in the amount required would probably draw attention to the operation too, making it a rather risky investment. <br /><br />You see a similar problem with cannabis growing operations. In holland there always is the debate about legalizing production as well. If it were legal to produce in large amounts, the price of pot would be $1 a gram or less, provided we just grow in the in the greenhouses now used to grow tomatoes and such.<br /><br />If substances like cocaine, and more particularly morphine and heroin were legal, their price would be incredibly low. The problem is not that it is hard to produce a gram of heroin, cannabis or cocaine for $1, the problem is doing that under conditions where it is illegal.
