				I can&#039;t seem to be able to get on SR right now but by the description it sounds like you are referring to &quot;spice&quot; which is sold as &quot;incense&quot; in many headshops.&nbsp; Originally it was herbs sprayed by JWH-018 (a synthetic cannabinoid) but was widely made illegal, so the chemicals are often slightly tweaked to evade the law.<br /><br />I have a friend that has a full time job and loves weed but gets drug tested and can&#039;t smoke it, so he rolls joints of this all the time.&nbsp; I smoked it for a few months when I was in the same boat but the taste and smell is awful and I sincerely feel less intelligent from smoking it.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun a few times, it&#039;ll get you feeling very similar affects to weed but it&#039;s just not the same.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually pretty cheap in headshops though if you have one in your local area if you&#039;d like to give it a go, but I also found it somewhat addictive.&nbsp; Hope this helps!

A chemical analysis will reveal the cannabinoids though, so you should check the legal situation in your country.<br />From what I could gather on the internet, synthetic cannabinoids do not cause false positives for THC. However, AM-2201 and many other cannabinoids can cause false positives for JWH-18 but that&#039;s virtually never tested for anyway.

And even if they don&#039;t notice, it&#039;s an assholish move. If you&#039;re going to sell it, tell people what they&#039;re putting in their bodies.

Also, you need to be sure what chem is used. I&#039;ve tried almost every synthetic canaboid rc out there. They differ significantly in effects. There is even subjective differences in the same family such as jwh-018 compared to jwh-122. You also need to take into consideration whatever herbal products are used will add an additional effect to the high. People tend to use damania since it&#039;s a sedative and can cause a relaxing feeling. I personally like to use marshmallow leaf since it soothes the muscles in the lungs.
