				Hey all! So I&#039;ve been eyeballing the upcoming music festivals this year, like Coachella and EDC, and they&#039;re both three-days long. With Coachella, I&#039;d probably be okay with just rolling one of the days. But with EDC, I&#039;d probably like to roll for at least two days, three if possible.<br /><br />Just to give a bit of background on myself, I&#039;ve dropped about ten times, first couple times with pills and the rest on molly (I&#039;m never going back to pressed pills!). I usually try to give myself at least 1-3 months between rolls, and I follow a lot of guidelines from others regarding fasting, preloading with supplements, etc.. My tolerance is not very high, and I can get a decent roll with 100mg, or really hard if I do 120mg (especially if it&#039;s Ivory&#039;s MDMA! ;)). My rolls can last anywhere between 4-6 hours.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking it won&#039;t even be possible to roll more than one day in a row with pure MDMA, since your serotonin would be depleted, and I doubt 12-24 hours after coming down would be enough recovery time in order to roll again. I also know this would be a terrible idea, but I&#039;m more curious than anything. Has anyone tried this? If you lived, please tell me your story.&nbsp; :P

				Thanks, I appreciate your concern. I know it&#039;s not a good idea... neurotoxicity, and I would never want to ruin the magic of MDMA. How the heck do other people drop multiple days at EDC? I&#039;m sure most of them take pressed E, and chances are it&#039;s cut with other stuff that keeps them going without necessarily rolling. If anything, I&#039;m more curious as to whether or not you can even do it.

				The only guy I know willing to roll on back to back days now requires 400-500mg to get his roll on.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t feel too comfortable about doing it.&nbsp; Hell, I felt terrible doing it two weekends in a row over the holidays (damn it was fun though).<br /><br />He&#039;s sooo dumb too.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the ridiculous amounts of MDMA or if it&#039;s just natural.&nbsp; :D

				Holy crap, half a gram to roll? I hope I never build up that much tolerance. But yeah, as I suspected, it sounds like it&#039;s difficult and pretty damaging to roll twice in two days... or more. I&#039;d like to hear from someone who has tried, though, just out of curiosity.&nbsp; ::)

				I&#039;ve done it back in the day, but it is really, really hard to get your second day&#039;s roll to be as good as the first.&nbsp; The basic guidelines are...<br /><br />1- Get a good preload on.&nbsp; My preferred mix was a combination of 5HTP, glutamine, tyrosine, DLPA and a decent B-complex multivitamin.<br />2- Don&#039;t got AWOL on the first night and eat too many pills (see #4).<br />3- Post-load.&nbsp; Similar mixture of stuff - start at least 12 hours before you plan to drop again.&nbsp; You need vitamin B6 with your 5HTP to start producing serotonin, and I seem to recall (cannot remember the source) that it takes about 12hrs for 5HTP to cross the blood-brain barrier.<br />4- Because your serotonin levels will still be well below baseline, you will need approximately 2x (or more) as much MDMA to roll the second night.<br /><br />Personally, I would say don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to a 3-day event... roll on day 1, try to get some sleep, and then roll on day 3.&nbsp; You might still feel like stir-fried shit the following week, but not nearly as bad as if you do it two days in a row.

				don&#039;t<br /><br />If you want to, take another psychedelic before, then mdma the next day.<br /><br />You can have fun multiple days in a row, but taking the same drug less than once every three weeks can (and usually is) dangerous.

				Either roll on the last day and go out with a bang or if you have to roll twice go first and third.&nbsp; You won&#039;t<br />want to do it three days straight.<br /><br />It is super important too not drink very much alcohol at all, lots of water&nbsp; and EAT as soon as you can <br />after your roll.&nbsp; Force yourself....&nbsp; &nbsp;Watermelon is one of the easiest things to eat when rolling.<br /><br />EATING and SLEEPING are more important than any supplements, as much as they can help.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend pre-loading with 5-htp, only post...&nbsp; <br /><br />

I am very much aware that rolling twice in two days is bad news bears, but it&#039;s nice to see that the option is there, even if it is going to be terrible for your health. I was never really planning on trying to do it anyway. <br /><br />In any case, everyone pretty much touched on my possible game plans:<br /><br />A) Taking it easy and just rolling the last day (very likely this is going to be the case)<br />B) Drinking a day, maybe a psychedelic another (LSD?), then rolling on the last? (second most likely choice)<br />C) Roll the first day, take it easy the second, then rolling the last day (doubt I would do this)<br />D) Roll twice in two days (don&#039;t think I&#039;d do this either, and three times in three days is definitely a no-no)<br /><br />Whatever ends up happening, I know to avoid alcohol, staying hydrated, resting up, and pre/post-loading supplements. Thanks to everyone so far for the tips!

				As others have said, preloading both days is the only way the MDMA would really stay fun the second day for most people. Consider taking a 100 mg dose the first day and a 200 mg dose the second. The combo of doubling your dose and preloading would reduce neurotoxicity and maximize effect, but still, not the greatest idea. I&#039;ve rolled on good pills two days in a row, without preloading, but the aftereffects were godawful.

				Multiple days is a baad idea. <br /><br />Last march, at a UK electronic music festival I did about 200mg of MDMA on the friday. Before bed and all the next day I ate 5-HTP and vitamins, lots of fruit, 10 hours sleep, excercise the next day. 24 hours later, I took 200mg. Nothing. So took another 100mg. When I did come up, I felt all tweaked out and weird but the night never really got going. On Sunday, I continued to eat 5-HTP, smoke lots of weed and got much sleep. <br /><br />The next few days were hell. On the wednesday I was still feeling miserable. On the thursday I was a weepy mess, home from work early, world ending depression.<br />I didn&#039;t do MDMA for 4 months after.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s tempting when there&#039;s a few days of music, but be careful. Why not do some 2C-B or mushrooms one night, MDMA the next and a nice chilled out drug free night on the last? Maybe just drink some beer, smoke some pot...<br />

				Rolling longer then 1 night in a row is real dangerous!<br />Of course it is your own decision to make but just be carefull!<br />I&#039;d just use something like regular amphetamine for the first day/days.... And MDMA on last eve so you can end the party with a bang...<br />That&#039;s probably only kindof bad for your dopamine-receptors, but they tend to recover relatively quick.... (L-Tyrosine is a legal precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine... So maybe it&#039;s a god idea to stock up on some of those then... No real experience though...)<br />Wondering, does anyone have experience with this? Doing speed first, then MDMA last night?<br />And also of course get some 5-HTP and take before and after party!<br />Vitamine C, et cetera... I&#039;m convinced you&#039;re already familiar with the whole lot....

				Oh boy, yeah. From what everyone&#039;s suggested, I definitely won&#039;t be trying to roll more than once over a weekend. I&#039;ve had a bad week after a single roll, and I can only imagine how shitty of a week I&#039;ll have after rolling twice over a weekend. x_x<br /><br />As far as supplements are concerned, I have vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid as antioxidants, magnesium for jawclenching, and 5-htp for seratonin. I haven&#039;t looked into L-tyrosine, but it makes sense if it&#039;s a precursor to dopamine. I&#039;ll definitely be pre/post-loading.<br /><br />But yeah, so it&#039;s looking like I&#039;ll be doing the three-course meal. :P Probably will get plastered with booze the first day, a psychedelic the second day, and roll the last day. As far as psychedelics are concerned, I only have experience with shrooms, and I&#039;m told it&#039;s not a very good festival drug. I haven&#039;t had 2C-B, and some people recommend LSD, which I haven&#039;t had either but I will try soon. A lighter dose of shrooms sounds like it might be fun, but I&#039;m not sure if I can handle the public while tripping yet, haha.<br /><br />

				About the tyrosine;<br /><br />&quot;In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to levodopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into the catecholamines norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).&quot;<br /><br />so levodopa (L-DOPA) should be a better precursor.. However it&#039;s prescription-only (used for Parkinson&#039;s if I remember correctly) and quite potent and dangerous... <br />L-Tyrosine is quite harmless though so it couldn&#039;t hurt to get some...<br />I&#039;ve also stocked up on vitamins, 5-HTP and L-Tyrosine since I&#039;ll be rolling next Saturday... Can&#039;t wait =D<br /><br />As far as the psychedelics... I only have experience with LSD... And I would personally never use it at a party... But that&#039;s just personal experience.... For as far as I read 2C-B or Mescaline should be best psychedelics for a party I guess... Since they both also have some sort of upper-effect
