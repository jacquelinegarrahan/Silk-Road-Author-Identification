				So I had been smoking spliffs with tobacco/hash, for a while and noticed I was no longer getting high anymore, so did this, got a glass vaporizer the one I used is called Vaponic, put some hash in it, about half filled the bowel, not that much, heated it with a torch lighter, took a lot of heat to get a hit, got about 3 huge hits, on the last hit the hash started to burn because it got too hot. this punched me in the lungs literally, I had to just stand there and cough/try and breathe for about 20 minutes, and then was so high I just stood at the window for like 40 minutes, the high was so strong I couldn&#039;t even think about a cigarette, which Im trying to quit anyway, almost brought me back to when I first started smoking weed which was 13 years ago...... try it you will get so high and it feels so much better than smoking dirty spliffs.<br />

				it happen to me before, but, i used to smoke like 20/30 joints per day, then left the smoking apart and quit, after 5 months i came back smokin up to 4 joints per day and im good with that, its just a matter of daily dosage i guess, or the quality of the buds indeed.

				Are you saying that using a vaporizor will overcome your high tolerance?

				My experience with weed is that I don&#039;t develop any tolerance at all from it.<br />After years of daily use I still get the same high of the same amount but I only smoke 2-3 joints a day so maybe that&#039;s why. Or maybe I just don&#039;t remember how high it got me in those early days.<br />We&#039;ll see in a while when I light up again as I&#039;m on a smoke break since January.

				Once you have been smoking for along time say over 10 or 15 years the receptors in your brain are just permanently burned out. Taking breaks then starting again i find myself in the same situation in a day or two. Only thing you can do is move onto other substances.

				I find that changing my intake pattern to many smaller hits, over a longer period, will both get me higher and find more of its way around tolerance. Vaporizers facilitate this by giving you a more linear, rather than spiked, intake.<br /><br />This also means things like bongs and massive rips are some of the least efficient ways to take in weed.
