				I have an accurate mg scale, would it be fine to measure say a 2mg dosage put it on the end of my tongue and wash it down with water like i would a bar or a couple of pills or with this powder would under the tongue be a more effective way of taking it getting a higher percentage of obsorbtion. i have some of the good stuff from Oliver and i want to make the most of it. thanks in advance for any suggestions.

				need help with this also. got a 250ml bottle with 1ml dropper and put in .25g of that xanax powder and while each ml drop feels like a football the powder isn&#039;t fully desolving. Most of it has formed a cloudy solution but ther are these flakes floating in it similar to some of the 2ci and coke ive had before that has that thin flake appearance. opinions much granted.

				Alprazolam isnt effectively water soluble, 40 mg/L at pH 7, which isn&#039;t much.<br />Dichloromethane works apparently. Ethanol, Methanol work to a degree.<br />In a study, xanax when dosed with Ethanol the effects were almost instantaneous. <br />

				Also might want to consider Propylene glycol as solvent according to BL.
