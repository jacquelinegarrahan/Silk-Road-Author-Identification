				Hi everyone, i&#039;m in vacation next week and i am going to do some camping. I have ordered some DOB and i have never tried this drug before, i want to know if i can take it with some beers. With LSD i take beers with no problem but with an unknown substance this scary me a bit. Have you ever experienced DOB with alcohol?

				I have no experience personally and can&#039;t find much on the clearnet either.<br /><br />Here are trip reports that include DOC + Alcohol mixtures:<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=60669<br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67058

				With most phenethylamines in my experience alcohol extremely extends the duration. A 2ci trip that would normally last, say, 6 hours or so, went on for days (an effect somewhat similar to tomso-ing). Since DOB is already rather likely to last 18+ hours, I don&#039;t think that you&#039;re going to need something extending the trip at all. If you took it with anything, I would suggest a benzodiazepine (depending on the dosage) because DOB is rather speedy and will definitely interfere with sleep.

				Thanks for the info, this one is funny: http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67058 the guy have done 12 mg of dob.. i don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true but this is clearly an idiot. I am planning of dropping 2.6 mg, i know the trip is long but i have some benzos to help me find the sleep if i&#039;m bored after 12 hours.. i will try it with some beers and i will let you guys know if it mix well.<br />

				You&#039;re welcome!<br /><br />Just a little more caution with the DOB: I took the 2.6mg blotters (presumably the same ones you&#039;re planning on taking) with two friends. Two of us handled it very well and enjoyed the shit out of it, but the third saw true psychotomimetic effects. He continuously talked to people who weren&#039;t present and complained about things that &quot;aren&#039;t okay,&quot; though we couldn&#039;t get him to explain any more. We eventually gave him Lorazepam when it was clear that he couldn&#039;t break out of it. The friend who didn&#039;t freak out also drank with it, and he was still getting CEVs two days later.<br /><br />I&#039;d just recommend that you make sure you&#039;re prepared for it (as it is kind of a high dose according to erowid, though not in a dangerous zone), and if you&#039;ve had troubles with other trips in the past, I might suggest you cut the tab in half or something.

I&#039;m an experienced psychedelic user i have done doses of 700-800 ug of lsd before and a lot of 25i (like 2-3 mg each time) i think i can handle such a trip..

				Just to update you guys: i have done the dob and it does nothing to me&nbsp; at all&nbsp; &gt;:(, and i have done what supposed to be 4 mg.. when i have received it&nbsp; was dropped in an envelope with no baggies, just between to sheets of paper. I&#039;m pretty sure the paper absorbed all of the product.. it&#039;s the first time on SR this thing happen to me, habitually vendors are careful with their products and put them in baggies. I don&#039;t want to say the name of this one but i&#039;m sure to not do business with i&#039;m again! Have a nice day everyone.
