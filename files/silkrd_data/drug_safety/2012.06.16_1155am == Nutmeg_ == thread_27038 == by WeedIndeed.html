				I&#039;ve recently experienced with nutmeg, just because I had absolutely nothing better to do with my time.<br />I grated roughly 1 nutmeg, and then compressed the product with my hands (compresses pretty easily due to high oil content) and swallowed it as if it were a pill.<br />I was tired as shit though so I went so sleep before noticing any effects.<br />Woke up in a few hours, and as far as I remember I was dizzy and my eyes turned red as shit. got back to sleep afterwards because I was still really tired.<br />upon waking up I didn&#039;t notice any effects, but in the following days I experienced diarrhea and just general stomach-ache.<br />I&#039;m thinking on trying it again without going to sleep a few minutes after taking it, any thoughts?

				With bitcoin prices changing constantly I don&#039;t really want to invest in them for now :P and street drugs&#039; quality just sucks around here. Plus, experiencing with different things is always (sometimes) a good thing!

				kicked around with nutmeg a few times and I would up your dose. I used to use preground nutmeg and cap it in gelatin caps, then take between 15-30 depending on how wasted I wanted to be. Its not a particularly fun trip, its like being very drunk without the sickness and little CEV. The drymouth is ubelievably bad and it lasts way to long at about 24-36 hours. On the other hand it is cheap and legal so I can understand the attraction&nbsp; ;)

				So basically it causes painful red eyes and gives you the shits... yet you would be willing to try that again?<br /><br />If you&#039;re on the spice isle next time, i suggest you pick up some cloves and roll them with rolling tobacco. If you&#039;re not used to that it may give you a nice buzz without much adverse effect ;)

				Yeah, trip out on nutmeg and then I-Dose.<br />&quot;I-Dosing is the use of auditory tones in an attempt to alter consciousness in ways that creates a simulated mood or experience, such as to mimic recreational drugs. The technique involves playing two different tones simultaneously to produce a perceived tone inside the head, in order to alter brainwaves.&quot;<br />(If you havent heard about this before, it is basically listening to trance and pretending you feel high.)

				I feel like half the users on this forum don&#039;t seem to know about or use SR, and seem to think this is an alternative to Bluelight or something
