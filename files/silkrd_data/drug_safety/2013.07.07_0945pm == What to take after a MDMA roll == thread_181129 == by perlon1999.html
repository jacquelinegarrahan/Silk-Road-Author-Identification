				Mostly i quarter a 200 mg XTC pill and take the quarters over a period of 6-7 hours.<br />For me it doesnt make any sense to take more than that, cause i just get more foggy and it just doesnt get me up high again if i take more MDMA than that.<br />but i need to stay clear and focused another 5-6 hours.<br /><br />what i took so far is<br /><br />speed : hard to control the dosis, i hate when the party is over and i cant sleep for another 6 hours or so, fucks up my whole week. second, there is only shit on the streets.<br />cocaine: fucking expensive, only shit here where i live, didnt order from SR though. but still would rather stay away from this drug.<br /><br />weed: im not a smoker, weed was never my thing - when i smoke it i get tired it definitly cant get me 5 hours more energy.<br />alkohol: no go !<br /><br />im kind of running out on options, cause i really dont know more stimulants than these.<br /><br />maybe someone has a tip.<br />would be really grateful.<br /><br />thx

				The responsible thing to take after MDMA would be an SSRI to cancel any neurotoxicity, followed by 5-HTP the next morning to help with your serotonin depletion.<br /><br />HOWEVER, you seem to be after something to continue the partying- so I&#039;ve heard that GHB is an absolutely fantastic substance to take while coming off of Molly. It apparently acts as a slight aphrodisiac, and seemingly negates the negative feelings of an MDMA comeoff. There&#039;s a thread on it buried somewhere in this forum.

				2cb. As soon as I peak from mdma is perfect I like to take about 15 mg orally or snort 10 mg shit will go crazy when you peak about an hour after u take it. But the 2cb slowly fall of after about 4 hours and then you have less lingering effects than mdma and u feel fine and go to sleep as soon as u want to. I normally take 150 mgs of mdma then as soon as I peak snort 15mgs of 2cb that&#039;s my best combo its really good together also love 2cb/mdma combo

Depends what you&#039;re taking. I&#039;m a painkiller user and my rolls just blow the opiates out of the water. Even taking an extra oxycodone pill that would normally have me nodding out doesn&#039;t bring me down when I&#039;m high.

				i always had some issues taking in MJ w/ MDMA. I.e i could essentially take in as much MJ as I could manage but i dont remember it really every seeming to take noticeable effect.&nbsp; and i vaguely remember trying to do that ALOT. <br /><br />remember folks, i am not commenting on safety - i dont know the science on this one nor do i plan to research it any time soon. i used oxycontin on a few occasions after MDMA, maybe dilaudid a time or two, but i really remember taking the IV morphiene (sp?) on a number of occasions after MDMA and the noticeable effect was being brought waaaaaaaaaaay down..... like all the way plus some... maybe that is a dangerous combination but it really packed a punch. also, note - i never had any dependency on morphene nor much of a tolerence for high doses. ..

				hey thanks for all the replies<br /><br />its seems what people want at a party is very different i should have be more clear about what i want to achieve.<br /><br />i like my mdma expierence, i dont want to change it, i have no problem with the comedown also, of course its not a good feeling but i dont know why but i seem to manage it better than others.<br /><br />my problem is, the party goes on for another 5 hours, I CANT take more mdma even if i wanted cause it doesnt bring me back up. after 200 mg mdma over 6 hours, every pill i take just makes me foggy and tired and doesnt give me energy.<br /><br />so im in search for something that makes me clear and not feel my hurting legs for 5-6 hours more.<br /><br />usually i would take speed, but i couldnt control the dosis, it would not let me go to sleep after 6 hours.<br />coke is really expensive, and we have only shit coke around.<br /><br />maybe there is a good way to control the dosis of speed that i dont know?<br />or some other durg that gives you a little bump again before the party finally ends.<br /><br />i thought about ketamin, but its a downer, i want energy, a clear head.<br /><br />im scared of GHB, we had two deaths in a short time from that drug.<br />as i heard you can easy overdose on that.

				It&#039;s all been said :)<br /><br />You&#039;re going to have to experiment to know more...<br /><br />2C-B + GHB in succession will give you precisely what you&#039;re looking for by your description.<br /><br />And GHB is extremely safe as long as you do not ever combine it with any other CNS depressants (and assuming your GHB is clean and you are able to dose accurately - i.e. it&#039;s powder). Your fears unfounded in that regard.<br /><br />BG
