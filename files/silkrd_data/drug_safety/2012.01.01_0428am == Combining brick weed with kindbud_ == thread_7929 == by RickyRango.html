				Recently I combined a small amount of mexican dirt weed with some Jack Harrier.&nbsp; I smoked it and it gave me what felt like the exact same high as pure Jack Harrier.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had other people tell me they do the same thing, but others say it degrades the weed.&nbsp; Can anybody give their opinion and experience with this?

				this scenario used to happen alot for me.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)&nbsp; i&#039;d have maybe like a 0.5 g of some nice kb (back then it was just Misc. KB Noname) and then would only be able to find brick mids.&nbsp; so i would top each bowl with a thin layer of finely ground kb.&nbsp; the buzz would always be strongly cerebral from the kb but have this underlying stone effect from the brick.&nbsp; seems the brick only messes with (or &quot;degrades&quot;) the high if it&#039;s a vastly different strain.&nbsp; most compressed brick stuff i see in the Mid-atlantic is Kentucky or Appalachian indicas but when it&#039;s a good mex sativa it can actually mix well.&nbsp; of course all those icky additives can mess it up sometimes..&nbsp; like when u taste the fertilizer and heavy metals.&nbsp; mm yum!!!<br /><br />good kb kief or some hash can mix well with brick!&nbsp; i used to smoke both on top of brick all the time but the brick almost served as filler.&nbsp; but hey it slowed the burn and the high was still clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />*destiny*

				It doesn&#039;t &quot;degrade&quot; the weed it just makes the good weed taste bad.<br /><br />I prefer to mix hash and weed...in my own experience and location REAL hash of various grades/nationalities&nbsp; is available 24/7 but killer buds is on and off and you have to deal with complete cunts to get it when your regulars are out.<br /><br />but I&#039;d stay away from smoking brick weed full stop, i&#039;m in the UK so we don&#039;t really get it over here we get homegrown, one time some massive black guy tried selling me a half ounce and I just laughed in his face and told him to piss off with his shit weed.<br /><br />I would just make cannabutter out of the brickweed smoking it will only fuck up your lungs...AND you&#039;ll get a MUCH BETTER high from edibles trust me.

				Dont you mean Jack Herrer? the strain was named after the activist (even though his surname is spelt Herer) but i cant say ive done that before, ill try it but i enjoy the flavor of the bud and putting brick weed in it will ruin the flavor for me.
