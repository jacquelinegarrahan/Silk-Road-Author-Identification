				So, I started my life on SR a few months back. I had always loved the feeling of an opiate high. Having used my legally prescribed Percocet 10/650 AP for many years as an occasional recreational drug, I found myself using up those prescriptions at a faster and faster rate. Not wanting to deal with my doctor flagging me for drug seeking behavior, I always made sure that my requests for a refill only happened every 4-6 months. Wanting to be able to enjoy the opiate high more regularly, I sought out other ways of procuring the drugs, which lead me to SR.<br /><br />At first, I bought a few Roxi&#039;s here and there, but the ease and consistency with which I could get them meant that I quickly started to have a sold stash on hand at all times. This all started in early October and by mid-November I was pretty consistently taking at least 30mg a day; however, as my tolerance rose I increased my intake. Come December I was routinely taking 60mg throughout the day and sometimes 90-120mg. When I ran out shortly before New Years, I thought that it would be no big deal. Boy was I wrong, about 24 hours after my last dose I began feeling flu like symptoms coming on, night sweats, insomnia, chills, diarrhea, etc. I realized at that point I was addicted and needed to titrate myself off of the drugs. So in January I made a bulk order saying to myself that this was my last order on the road for awhile and that I would titrate my dosage down from 3ish pills per day to zero, where I could then return to the occasional recreational usage of the drug.<br /><br />Well, when the bulk order arrived I went crazy. Quickly the 50 pills diminished to 20, at which point I said, &quot;Okay, these 20 I&#039;m going to use to titrate myself off of this shit.&quot; Didn&#039;t happen. Since then I&#039;ve made far too many orders of the pills, each time telling myself that this order, these pills would be used to wean myself off the Oxy. Each time I&#039;ve failed. When the product arrives, I count the pills and say, &quot;Okay, I have 30 pills, so if I have two more days of fun, I can then start reducing the dosage, 2 pills for 5 days, 1.5 pills for 5 days, 1 pill for 5 days, 0.5 pills for 5 days, then nothing or maybe a quarter pill before bed to just help me not have night sweats and insomnia.&quot; Each time, I find myself using too many of the pills too quickly and cannot enact my schedule. Also, the schedule that I described above is quite aggressive and ignores the traditionally recommended schedule of reduction. Most articles I have read recommend a 5-10% reduction in the intake of the drug per week. Since I&#039;ve been consistently at 90-150mg/day, that would mean that if I even went on the low-end the schedule would be 90mg for a week, 80mg for a week, 70mg for a week, 60mg for a week, 55mg for a week, etc. Which is a lot of pills. Right now, I&#039;m just trying to avoid going through another round of withdrawals.<br /><br />Now I am faced with another dilemma: I am so broke due to this habit that I don&#039;t think I can afford to buy these pills to follow the protocol for weaning myself off of them. I have swallowed my pride and realized that I need professional help, so I called a number of drug and alcohol treatment facilities and doctors who specialize in opiate addiction. However, I have hit a number of significant roadblocks:<br /><br />1) I do not qualify to be immediately taken into some of the programs due to: 1. my insurance not covering mental health 2. my income not being too low 3. no legal troubles 4. no immediate health troubles due to this addiction 5. no circumstances that make me a terrible risk to myself, others, or my health.<br /><br />2) The physicians who specialize in treating opiate addiction are either not taking new patients (I live in a fairly rural area) or only deal with this addiction through suboxone treatment, which leads me to another issue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2a) I have read a good amount of literature (peer reviewed journal articles and anecdotal accounts) concerning the fact that suboxone withdrawal is even more difficult than straight opiate withdrawal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2b) The individual I spoke with at a physician&#039;s office who deals with opiate addiction gave me the pricing information for suboxone treatment and the treatment would be more expensive than buying more of these pills illegally and attempting to wean myself off of them. $65 for the initial counseling session to see if I qualify to see the doctor; $200 for the first doctors visit to determine the appropriate treatment protocol; $800 for the initialization of the suboxone treatment; $5 - $16 per pill depending on the dose; $65 for every followup with a counselor and $150-$200 for every followup with the physician. Overall the first month of that treatment could run $1580, which could get me 60+ Roxi&#039;s, allowing me to actually try titrating the dosage down and getting me off of the drugs.<br /><br />3) As I mentioned above, finances have become incredibly tight for me. I&#039;m a student with a lot of loans, an expecting father, and have blown a ton of money on this habit.<br /><br />4) I cannot enter any residential treatment/detox programs, as I need to be able to attend school. Any time off is not an option (I&#039;m a medical student).<br /><br />5) According to the woman I spoke with at one of the treatment centers, the doctor cannot prescribe me oxycodone to allow me to work with her on reducing my dosage until I can be clean. The woman said that if I deemed to be addicted to the drug, that a physician prescribing me the drug could lose his/her license.<br /><br />So, I am looking for advice on what to do. Is there a way to go to another physician who does not (or does) specifically work with addiction, who could prescribe me oxy in a way that would allow me to wean myself off of it at a more reasonable cost than what I can get through the road? Does anyone have any suggestions on supplementation that could help ease some of the symptoms of withdrawal? Does anyone have just any general advice on what to do? As I said previously, I really do not want to go onto suboxone. The whole protocol is incredibly expensive and all I&#039;m really doing is trading one addiction for another and that other addiction (suboxone) has worse withdrawal symptoms according to what I&#039;ve read.<br /><br />Anyways, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know I need to go to some form of NA/AA meeting to try and get some sort of support system in place. I am at the end of my rope though and am about a day or two away from sitting down with some of the physicians I am close with at my medical school to try and get there help; however, I would prefer not to involve anyone who is part of my life in that environment.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance for reading this and giving me any advice that you might have.<br /><br />TL;DR - I&#039;m addicted to oxycodone, cannot afford and do not want to go onto suboxone treatment, and desperately need help finding a way to get off of this shit.

				i would suggest getting kratom. it&#039;s a plant in the coffee family that happens to be very effective in treating opioid dependence and withdrawal. it has opiate-like effects but is more similar to coffee than opiates when it comes to the addictive potential. kratom is also an immunostimulant with 20 times the antioxidants as green tea! :)

				I feel for you my friend. It is a tough spot you are in with the insurance situation. <br /><br />If you are considering suboxon have you considered a methadone clinic. Just say you don&#039;t have insurance. Most will treat on a sliding scale fee. Like suboxon it is more addictive than the oxycodone. <br /><br />Most detox programs are only a&nbsp; couple of days. You don&#039;t have to go to rehab after. Just do the detox 3-5 days. Maybe admit yourself on a Friday and leave mon or Tue to minimize the time you are out of school. I know this sounds like too long but when you look at it as saving the rest of your life a few days isn&#039;t soo long. <br /><br />If you tell your pm doc he will cut you off immediately. I wish doctors had more flexibility with this. But they don&#039;t. <br /><br />As a last resort you can go to an ER while in withdrawal and they will have to treat you.<br /><br />Are you 100% sure you don&#039;t qualify for Medicaid. I would apply if I were you. The application will have a box to check yes if you have a disability. Check that as many states have a program to help people with disabilities qualify for Medicaid if they work while disabled. Not all states have this but many do.<br /><br />I am sure you have seen that Sr does have vendors that sell suboxon and methadone. <br /><br />Do you have any friends you can trust? You could give them your pills and money with strict instructions about how much to give you to help you complete your cut back program.<br /><br />

				go cold turkey. <br />lock yourself up in your home, stock up on food and get someone to help you. (sitter) <br />or<br /><br />i heard good things about smoking dmt when coming off.<br /><br />and yes kratom could help too<br />also dxm amplifies opiates. it could help you to decrease dosage!<br /><br />dont go the methadone route! that is worse. you will never get off that stuff. with opiates you got a chance. with methadone you dont.

				@valakki:<br /><br />I have tried the cold turkey approach, but by day 5, I was in so much discomfort, unable to sleep (thus exhausted), and in such bad shape I couldn&#039;t do anything. As a med student (I&#039;m not talking pre-med, I&#039;m talking medical school), I can&#039;t afford a day off or a period of time where I can barely function. I&#039;ll look more into the kratom, DMT, and DXM as options for assisting me while decreasing the dosage.<br /><br />@zerik:<br /><br />Thanks, insurance sucks, and while mine might cover it to some degree, I worry about it flagging me for future approval of pain medications or other meds that might be necessary (i.e. the once labeled a junkie, always a junkie mentality). I do have a legitimate need for opiates at times, as I suffer from severe migraine headaches and a combination of sumatriptan and oxycodone has shown to be really the only effective treatment for me. That combination is after about 15 years of tinkering to find something that provided true relief.<br /><br />In terms of detox programs there are a number of issues: 1) as a medical student, I really cannot have any downtime. Missing a day of class is like missing a week of work. 2) My wife actually does not know about this situation. We are expecting our first child in a few months (we conceived before this addiction started, but the addiction started before I found out about the pregnancy). We have been having some really rough patches lately and I believe telling her about my addiction would severely strain what is already very strained. I know too that that conversation would reach the point that I would need to, to a degree, disclose how much I&#039;ve spent on this habit.

				if you cant afford to &quot;not function proper&quot; then DXM is not for you.<br />works wonderfully with opiates makes them a lot more potent but the dose you need for it will cause hallucinations for hours. not the best thing if you are a med student.<br />can be lots of fun of course <br />but you don&#039;t want to risk freaking out about a patient because bugs under his skin keep moving in geometric shapes....<br />but research it! i only know about medium - high dose use with opiates.<br /><br />If you want to try the DMT route i think you should smoke it once every few days. <br />That chemical just completely destroyed my cigarette addiction.&nbsp; bam. it was gone. <br />for 2 days. after that i forced myself back on it. i needed the extra stimulation it gives me at work.<br /><br />if you go this way i think you should smoke it then try to go cold turkey after it. if you got problems hit it with more DMT. if that does not help get back on the opiate but dose very low. Craving hits again? hit it with DMT.&nbsp; and repeat this pattern. <br />Hit it twice -- get your fix---hit it twice----get your fix------ Understand what i mean? <br />since DMT hallucinations&nbsp; only lasts for 10-20 minutes with maybe 30 min aftereffects it should fit into your time just fine. <br />(Edit: its not as easy as it sounds. this is a very strong drug and can give&nbsp; you very unpleasant experiences if you are not in the right state of mind)<br /><br />Kratom is a good thing. makes you puke nasty plant shit if you abuse it so you wont overdo it like you do with oxy-s. does not work for everyone but its really worth a try. you could entirely replace you oxy habit with this. And as far as i know coming off is a lot easier. It will cause withdrawal but nothing as intense as oxy.<br /><br />hope i helped.

People just don&#039;t know what pain is till they suffered from those. <br /><br />Same thing for me as well. Only thing that works is opiates and even then. <br />&nbsp;:&#039;( not always. <br /><br />Also have a back injury. So I understand what it is like to live in pain. <br /><br />O shit you are already in medical school leaving you with fewer options. It is kind of fucked that someone can&#039;t get help without hurting their career. I can see why you don&#039;t want to risk it. Normally I would suggest using your medical problem and protection of the&nbsp; ADA to get time off too take care of yourself.<br /><br />I have heard a lot about katrom for help with wd. Supposed to work very well. If not too expensive it is worth a try. MDMA I don&#039;t know about but people here really swear by it. <br /><br />Obviously things like weed can also help. Don&#039;t know if any of this helps in your situation. Do you get drug tested for work?<br /><br />Being a doc I am sure you are aware of other meds like Xanax, ambien for anxiety and insomnia. Tylonal for fever and pain. Imodium ad is also helpful. Benadryl for flu symptoms. <br /><br />Sorry to hear things with your wife are strained. Having support at home would help. You will need some kind of support so if you can&#039;t trust friends or family then use the forum here. Lots of good people here that will help. <br /><br />Keep us updated on how you are doing.&nbsp;

				you could try ibogaine, it has had tremendous success so far as helping people kick opiates goes. To the best of my understanding, it essentially resets your tolerance to zero.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been stuck in your position and can really empathize! It&#039;s a horrible place to be but I&#039;ll tell you now that the easier part is getting off, the hardest is staying off!! So when you make that decision - be prepared for a big fight but it is one YOU CAN WIN!<br /><br />First things first, I&#039;d recommend working out a long term plan i.e how are you going to cope once you are off these pills? NA meetings can help some people loads and for others not so much. There are loads of programs out there. I attended NA for a while and they helped me loads but after a while I couldn&#039;t really hack talking about not taking drugs all day lol. You will need the help of either family, friends and hopefully professionals if you truly want to beat it. Yes there are those that can do so by shear will power alone but unfortunately the vast majority of us in these situations require solid support. Work out some goals (realistic ones of course) and taking baby steps, work slowly towards them IMO. Will take time and determination but it looks like you have a lot to get clean for!! I wouldn&#039;t want to waste it on something that stops working after a while...<br /><br />Now to getting off these things - <br /><br />CT is probably the best way as is the quickest! However it&#039;s obviously the most painful and midway through you&#039;d even sell your girlfriend if had the chance for a fix. not good!<br /><br />I did a subutex taper and to be honest was really not that difficult coming off a habit of 160-240mg per day at the time of oxy (snorted/oral). You can get away with really small doses of sub imo along with some benzos (be careful not to take too many), vitamins, 5HTP (for depression), hot baths, mild excercise and if have access to clonidine or even better lofexidine (as clonidine will require constant blood pressure checks and can be dangerous) this can help greatly too!! Metoclopromide and/or zofran are excellent for the nausea - zofran especially - see Novartis on SR!! I used ALL these tricks and it really wasn&#039;t as bad as my mind was telling me it would be. Yes I was terrified but I too HAD to stop or I would&#039;ve lost everything and had already lost enough!<br /><br />Using a friend to guard your stash whilst you taper can be a good thing but tapering is hard + long as it drags on and one bad day can take you back to square one - specially whilst you still have access to SR!<br /><br />Suboxone if used for shorter periods is a miracle drug and nothing like methodone to come off (have tried both)! If used tapering every 2-3 days over 2 weeks, you will hardly feel withdrawal. It may be more prolonged but will be much lighter imo. A good starting dose for your tolerance could be as little as 2mg per day (1 in the morning and 1 evening). You can go a little higher if needed but would advise the minimum possible to stop the withdrawals. Then reduce dose by 25% every 2-3 days for nearly painless WD.&nbsp; It won&#039;t get you high but you will feel &#039;normal&#039;. It really saved my life and I too read so much on it before starting treatment (good and bad) but the pros outweighed the cons for me! It lets you get on with life and fix things till your ready to come off completely. This is for longer treatment of course but for a taper, 2 weeks is perfect for minimal withdrawals. You won&#039;t even cluck for it as it doesn&#039;t even get you high once dependent on full agonists imo.<br /><br />Note - this is what worked for me and felt to share having read your post. everyone is different of course and what works for some, doesn&#039;t for others and vice versa. I wish you the best in coming off and hope you make the decision too. Even though I do take these nowadays&nbsp; every so often, I&#039;m very careful now not to take more than 3 days in a row. SR has been bad for me too in that way lol. It&#039;s easy to go back and I know that I&#039;m not immune - just a bit of a dumb ass and sucker for these lovely evil little pills on the weekend :o<br /><br />If you want a proper taper schedule PM me and will send one over. Also any other advice am happy to pass on. It would be cheaper to buy your drugs on SR than via insurance in the states imo. However if can afford treatment then would highly recommend as good to be monitored when coming off or mixing drugs. I live in EU so we get free healthcare but waiting time sucks balls...<br /><br />Best of luck!

				Mate, whatever you do, do not replace your oxy with methadone. An oxy withdrawal is 2-4 days, a methadone one is 1-2 weeks. Seriously!<br /><br />Cold Turkey the initial stop, it hurts, I&#039;ve done it 10-15 times now, I know it isn&#039;t nice, but just do it, don;t taper, you&#039;ll lie to yourself and stay on it.<br /><br />To keep off it is easy, cut all ties with your source, ALL TIES. While you&#039;re still sane (day 4-5) do everything you can to make it as hard as possible to get more oxy. If you are really struggling then get some subbies, I recommend the 0.2mg ones for keeping the mental wd away. Crush up 2-3 and snort them once or twice a day. for me at least the placebo effect of snorting something helps a lot.<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert and though I&#039;ve experienced these wd many times I&#039;ve not got as good advice as above, but for your own sake, do not start on the methadone.<br /><br />Regards,<br />BL

				Byron makes a good point re methadone and CT! I agree re a long taper - it&#039;s even more difficult that CT!! Can just buy some subbies (the .2mg&#039;s are good idea) and rest of meds on suggested list and get through it all for around 200 bucks which is far cheaper than the doc. Total time 1-2 weeks max depending on how fast you want to go. I would say that sometimes a little pain is good so you remember not to go back but in my opinion that&#039;s never taught me a lesson lol!<br /><br />Melatonin can be a good more natural way of restoring sleep too and maybe some soma for when you start riding the bicycle in bed (which gets me the worse)&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I like to be prepared as it eases my mental state somewhat but then that&#039;s just me.

				You know, while I&#039;m floating a boat of M and chewing a half dozen of val and chasing it with an Ice cold Mich Ultra, then sucking on 60-100 mg of OX every 4 hours until they turn to dissolved gel that I again wash down with the Ice Cold Ultra, sniffing a couple of IR MS right after the Ox, reading this really sucks....Why can&#039;t people just waste themselves away til they are homeless and&nbsp; society doesn&#039;t even notice who they were or where they going. Ah the good ole days. Now we have students that got themselves hooked on one of the most publicly talked about epidemics since the first flu attack on humans and the concern is not to let her father(who&#039;s paying for most of the bills) and close friends find out. WHILE IN MED SCHOOL...Serious, ...GO GET HELP OR YOU WILL LOSE SCHOOL, FAMILY, FRIENDS AND A FUTURE,. Subutex works, but find the Dr. that has your best interest in mind not his or her wallets. That is the real hard part, because when you do find that Dr. they will show you that this med is used to ease the withdraws, NOT ERASE. You will need help from family and friends no matter how many bad asses on here did it alone. You can not, because of all the reasons mentioned in your confessional starting this thread. I have been there, lost 2 marriages, school, carriers, family, friends and children. I now live on the street and surf the road looking for people like you who think they can cure their illness on their on terms..huh, not that I completely disagree with that last statement, but the fact is we most often lose everything first and when that happens, what have you got to fight for except get high to ease the pain of the pain you caused...GO GET HELP AND BE HONEST WITH THE PEOPLE THAT STILL LOVE AND CARE ABOUT YOU BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE THERE FOR LONG..GOOD LUCK GOD BLESS AND ALL THAT....

				Having just kicked a nasty heroin addiction, I know what your going through. If nothing of what the others are saying are helping you and your still struggling, there is another option that most people aren&#039;t aware of. Look up on the SR for Ibogaine. Do some research on it. I went to Mexico and paid $4k to get the stuff and stay there for 2 weeks, when I could have paid a few bucks and got it for myself here. It will completely rid you of your opiate withdrawl. <br /><br />Quick note:Your gonna trip. Hard. The more Ibogaine you can take in 20 hours time the better. Start out with a medium dose and take more if possible. You will not be able to stand for at least 8 hours or so, as you spin like crazy when you get up from laying down, and you might possibly throw up too. But for anyone struggling with opiate addiction, this is by far IMO the easiest way out. Good Luck!

				i have been addicted to mostly oxys and lortabs for nearly two years.I have never taken more than 110 mgs ever. I have arthritis and w/o them i am so depressed and cant work and want to kill myself until I have them again. I have no insurance and pain doctors are really expensive and around here you gotta be a heroin addict to get it. its spose to help pain. I am next to homeless , thankful im not, and dont know where to turn. I went thru wds twice once i gave up on fifth day i was so sick i dont care what you guys think i woulda died I had no one around and other i weaned down and have a few subs that was better but i couldnt work, got kicked out of the room i traded work for and i hate getting old and being a drug addict. SR saved me, id surely be dead by now...i just wish i could find a doctor that would just write and&nbsp; not cut me off after a couple scripts because i cant afford tests or i wont tell them previous doctors. Signed up for SSI to get Medicaid but thats a longshot since i cant get a doctor to back it up, they all say NO SSI...extra work. I dont have family that is helpful. All those overdose statistics- how many are suicide but they dont want to say that? I either have to learn to like living life with pain or keep up the hustle it feels like.&nbsp; There is either the addiction road, im left non functional and cant do anything or im not fucked up enough yet close enough to death lucky enough to find a doctor that will help me to get just a good 50 -60 max mgs a day script. Any ideas? Thank you, better ppl here than irl. ~ an addicted chronic pain person.

				I feel for you bro.&nbsp; But it could be a lot worse.&nbsp; I was using about 600-1200mg per day...<br /><br />One thing I will say about suboxone - it can be used in a rapid detox.&nbsp; I did go to a rehab/detox facility once and they would give all the opiod addicts a suboxone taper. I would start with like 4mg, and do 4mg the next day, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.5, etc etc.&nbsp; That should be a painless taper.&nbsp; The good things about subs is you dont get high on them so you won&#039;t really fiend to take more.<br /><br />The key is to not keep using it more than a week or so.&nbsp; That type of detox is a LOT less painful then going cold turkey.&nbsp; But remember the challenge is not getting clean, it is staying clean.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I read your story, and I really feel for you. I have been through withdrawals, and they are no joke. I would not go the suboxone route, either. It will leave you in worse shape, for sure. There is an amazing (life-changing) medicine out there, called IBOGA. It is not legal in the US, but there are providers that work underground here. It IS legal in Mexico and Canada. There are clinics that offer it to get folks off of their opiate addiction. IBOGA is an &quot;addiction interrupter.&quot; It works---immediately. I used it to get off of my habit (120mg daily). You would have to take a couple of days off; that&#039;s not negotiable. Please, check out myeboga dot com (I know, it&#039;s spelled weird) for providers. It will save your life, and it will change you in a positive way, no doubt.

				I have just written a long note and then deleted it because I have not been there, but I will leave two thoughts - 1. you have so much at stake that you need to get more help than anonymous bunch of us can give you - talk to your family, ask for help. Something has to give here ... Or everything might crumble as @southpaw has so eloquently described.<br />2. Read eboka.info - lots of similar stories and info on how to do it with ibogaine, but there again - to stay clean requires ongoing family support.<br />Best of luck and may you find strength to pay a fair price for what you seek

				One drug will be your best friend memantine never heard of it? Most people have not, it is a very potent NMDA agonist that will quite literally rewire you brain. there is a lot of documented evidence of nmda agonists completely reversing tolerance and there by stopping all withdrawals. Your body wont ach, you wont feel sick and its not possible to get high on memantine. Its legal to buy and you can just take it for a week or two and not have any withdrawals at all. it works in a very similar way to DXM but will not get you impaired and you will not feel dissociated or trippy. Maybe some cannabis or a benzo for sleep the first few nights and your golden.

				I&#039;m a recreational kratom user and I&#039;ve been buying from speciosa.com for a couple years now. It is legal in the US as far as I know, just don&#039;t mention that you want it as a drug in any communication with them, they sell it as &quot;incense&quot;.<br /><br />The Maeng Da kratom they sell there is top notch, and should def help with tapering from &quot;true&quot; opis.<br /><br />Keep in mind that kratom has a cross tolerance with opiates, so it had it&#039;s own addictive potential. You don&#039;t want to go out of the frying pan and into the fire, but as a legal alternative to help you kick, I&#039;ve heard multiple sources say that it helped alleviate symptoms.<br /><br />When/if you take it, keep in mind that it&#039;s a much slower come up, so be careful with dosage. take too much and you&#039;ll puke your guts out. Best benchmark I can give that that to get high, as a person with very little tolerance (10mg oxycodone as a rec. dose) I take about 5 grams of Maeng Da orally (in gelcaps). I can&#039;t say what your dosage would be to ease WDs so just be smart, titrate your dose, and don&#039;t panic if you don&#039;t feel it right away. I&#039;ve sometimes not peeked with it until 2 hours after taking it.<br /><br />Also if all else fails, keep in mind that opiate withdrawals are not fatal (unlike some other drugs), agonizing as they may be.<br /><br />Good luck kicking man.

				well noone responded to me and now i am in withdrawls with some Lortab 5&#039;s (about 12) to make it easier. And I got a script for some benzos. i got kicked out as i started my weaning from appx 60 mgs a day two days ago when to 50 then 40 yesterday 30 today no more just the lortabs .i just wish i had the courage and money to get enough heroin and die. Fuck the mean ppl who call you a low life junkie I never stole anything from anyone! and have always been a nice good person but still i have nowhere to turn. I will be sleeping in an empty house&nbsp; for sale tomorrow, who knows after that in withdrawals. I only have like 70 mgs of lortabs i plan to&nbsp; try n make them work till i can get more oxys because as i said i am non functional w/o i am happy im doing this even if i got kicked out cuz im &quot;negative&quot; and when i told about pain pills they said i had to leave.&nbsp; I am hoping to be able to get to 20 lortabs then only 15mgs a day oxys. I managed to make it ok with 40 mgs of hydros or oxys for a long time and it was enough to have a little quality of life. But drs wont even prescribe me that. They wont give me suboxone because im not enough of a junkie apparently. But the withdrawals are still horrible i already have diarrhea and i hadnt even run out,,,just cut off oxys to half. I want to try and be out of pain in the am mostly when its worst. I am really scared cause u guise say its days 5-6 that are the worst. When I had a script of just 4 a day 10s i was fine could even work but now i cant find a dr to give me anything and im in a new state. This anti pain pill propaganda and ppl who get addicted ruined my life trying to live in pain with bs scripts like gabapentin or tramadol or NSAIDS. Two years i had stayed under 60 mgs now to go thru wds bcuz i cant get any opiate script and then I know what its like w/o them. mornings i cant even use my hands, and no help.

Fuck the mean ppl who call you a low life junkie I never stole anything from anyone! and have always been a nice good person but still i have nowhere to turn. I will be sleeping in an empty house&nbsp; for sale tomorrow, who knows after that in withdrawals. I only have like 70 mgs of lortabs i plan to&nbsp; try n make them work till i can get more oxys because as i said i am non functional w/o i am happy im doing this even if i got kicked out cuz im &quot;negative&quot; and when i told about pain pills they said i had to leave.&nbsp; I am hoping to be able to get to 20 lortabs then only 15mgs a day oxys. I managed to make it ok with 40 mgs of hydros or oxys for a long time and it was enough to have a little quality of life. But drs wont even prescribe me that. They wont give me suboxone because im not enough of a junkie apparently. But the withdrawals are still horrible i already have diarrhea and i hadnt even run out,,,just cut off oxys to half. I want to try and be out of pain in the am mostly when its worst. I am really scared cause u guise say its days 5-6 that are the worst. When I had a script of just 4 a day 10s i was fine could even work but now i cant find a dr to give me anything and im in a new state.

Got it? you have to choose to live life with out opiates, and yes you will have pain. You have to go through the withdraws so you can appreciate what it is like to be free from the opiates. There is no magic potion that will correct the years of addiction. It doesn&#039;t matter that we have pain or were prescribed meds from a legit doctor. The fact remains that you, me, we allowed ourselves to get to the point of physical addiction. Yes everyone that takes these meds gets physically addicted it just a matter of how long it takes and to what degree each individual has physical withdraws. Advice is to go through the withdraws and LIVE..It does get easier and better..

				&nbsp;I&#039;ve been addicted to oxy&#039;s and hydrocodone more times than I can count. It&#039;s no fun getting off them, oxy&#039;s are worse. They are in no way to be compared to heroin though. I&#039;ve always had to got to jail, methadone to get off. I had a 4 or 5 day&nbsp; habit of 80 mg. OC&#039;s. that was the hardest pill to withdraw from but I was able to do it. You aren&#039;t going to do much for 3 days, making drinking some water, I doubt much to eat. If you can detox off of hydrocodone, it&#039;s easier. If you have less than maybe 10 5mg hydrocodone habit, it&#039;s not hard. In some ways, your first day is the worst, because you know that you will feel worse the next day. Actually the second day you&#039;ll probably feel the worse. I cannot sleep, so if you had any kind of valium, xanax, it will make the 3 days go by faster. Don&#039;t drink, I didn&#039;t like the effects. Weed definitely helped, it really helped. <br />The oxy&#039;s were the worst, they were really painful getting off, but you can do it. And this is coming from someone who never could kick heroin. <br />Your anticipation is one of the worst feelings that causes you to be uncomfortable. That panic feeling that you NEED MORE. <br />I&#039;ts hard to desribe to someone kicking pills that it&#039;s not too hard (I&#039;ve done it over 10-15 times) Plan not to do much for 3 days, when you&#039;re in your third day you&#039;ll already be starting to feel a little better. <br />I&#039;ve been on methadone for a couple of years, THAT was hard to get off of. You have to taper slowly. <br />I&#039;ve taken subutex too, I didn&#039;t really like it except at first when I wasn&#039;t sick, and could wake up well. Maybe if you do a very fast taper with subutex it might work, but I found it much easier to get off pills that subutex. <br />Kratom helped my get off subutex (pills could work too, subutex is very uncomfortable for me. A lot of restless leg, and some EXTREME nervousness)<br />Good luck and keep writing. It helps you to keep you mind off your &#039;kicking&#039;. It&#039;s NOT like heroin to get off of, so IMO don&#039;t get on methadone or subutex instead. <br />Not too many get off methadone, it&#039;s going to be years if you&#039;re on that, but if you have a good clinic you can get off it too. It sure gets you high, but I eventually got tired of that high.

				In fact these days I&#039;ll only take pills because to me it&#039;s not that hard to get off&nbsp; them. Unless you&#039;re taking 4 or 5 80 mg. oxycontin, that is, and even that can&#039;t be compared to heroin. <br />Xanax, ambien, valium, weed and (eventually when you&#039;re in your 3 or 4 day-Kratom) are your friends. Don&#039;t &#039;slip&#039; and take a pill though, you&#039;ll only feel good for a couple of hours and then you have to start over again.

				Money becomes just paper,means nothing,it comes then goes.All the wasted time and money.You reach the point where you don&#039;t even know who you are anymore.Being trapped,the level&nbsp; of pain,and mental suffering is undescribable....Yep i feel your pain,know all about it.This is my second or third time ,trying to get completly off oxycodone op&#039;s.My daily was 80-120mg a day for several years,recreationally.<br />I knew i would just sit here high ,for forever till the money ran out.<br />So i &quot;snapped&quot; on my main supplier ,an old friend.And he cut me off.Got 3 more blues from another dealer ,30 bars,and 2 grams of coke.After i got past the first 3 rough taper days ,30mg to 15mg.Once the first 2 days &quot;the physical sick days&quot; passed .Now im at 1/4 tablet 7mg a day...<br />I got up in the morning ,past 3 days start doing bumps of coke.Once im jacked up enough (doesn&#039;t take that much ),that tired mental and lethargic shit doesn&#039;t really register &quot;at all&quot;...&quot;Then&quot; i force myself to walk or ride bike &quot;miles&quot; downtown ,or any places i need to go ..Work on shit,ect ect .Im getting alot of stuff accomplished,Ill take the continuous coke high &quot;each day&quot; .Which im getting tired of..Over <br />laying on the couch,getting nothing done,going through the mental anguish ,and maby picking up the phone again.The bars good for sleep or taking the edge off if needed.So im on the coke + lots of exercise withdrawl method..I figure i got about 4-5 more days till ,im taking nothing but bumps and beer.Then nothing at all ,the coke i can put down.The pills &quot;those fucking<br />pills!!&quot; Never daily again!!!I&#039;ll try and remember these days...There&#039;s alot of life to live,and i really need a fuckin job..Tried methadone some years back,those withdrawls were even harder<br />...........Do whatever ya need to do...to get where you need to go..And may i bestow highest success in your endeavor................&nbsp; vitamins everyday &quot;of your life&quot;..At least a multi and omega -3 fish oils caps ,l-tyrosine<br /><br />

				Well i made it through for the most part.....The only thing i have ,is a bit of fatigue and stomach discomfort from 12pm-5pm.....My big turnaround day was day 10...The mental madness..and heavy cravings went away..And i am back to my sober self ,and starting to focus in ..Ready to look for work .....A big thing that i think would help anyone trying to get off opiates..Make sure you have company days 4-10 .Start exercising &quot;weights or walking &quot; every 2 days ,and taking vitamins daily long before you intend to stop usage...I started a year 1/2&nbsp; before this ..and i think thats why i had a pretty quick turnaround ..considering daily useage for past several years...If you are completly out of shape /not getting what your body needs ...When you completly stop even from a taper ,man your in for a ride!!..This was still a bitch ,but without the vitamins .coke and xanax for sleep .I can imagine how long those days and nights would have been ....

				yes having work was definitely a huge help with taking your mind off of things. but you know that fatigue <br />you speak of. try doing all of that while working.. sucked!! the thing is, when your addicted to opiates and <br />&#039;use them freq. enough your body is not getting the nutrition it needs.it weakens even the strongest <br />people. but anyhow congratulations on your sobriety!! thats awesome! now you can start living again!<br />i would say for me it took about a month or so before i felt totally normal. without any uncomfortable <br />mental or physical issues. but it only gets easier physically! its your mind that will fuck with you! <br />you develop&quot;selective memory&quot; only remembering the good times while getting high! just gotta keep that <br />in mind! congrats man! keep up the good work!
