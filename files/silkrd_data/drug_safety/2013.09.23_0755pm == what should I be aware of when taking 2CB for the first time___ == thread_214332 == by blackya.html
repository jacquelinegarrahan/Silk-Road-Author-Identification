Be somewhere comfortable with pillows and blankets like if you were taking MDMA. Have a selection of music ready, because music definitely colors this experience greatly. Think about possibly taking a walk somewhere. This drug enhances just about anything you see and changing scenery is a very welcome feeling. Once you start walking you won&#039;t want to stop :) <br /><br />If your 2C-B is clean, then you should be able to sleep pretty easily after about 4-6 hours. <br /><br />Have a great time!!

				Have some gas-x or something similar. 2C-B always causes some stomach pain with me...but gas-x or a little bit of MDMA will take care of it.<br /><br />I think it is more like MDA than MDMA+LSD, it just doesn&#039;t have that empathy that MDMA produces...but the psychedelic effects are pretty awesome haha. It&#039;s pretty badass.

				Remember that alcohol will increase your effects, so try to avoid that if it&#039;s your first time.<br /><br />Watching a complex movie is pretty enjoyable since you are - or at least I am when taking 2c-b - much better at seeing complex relationships.

I&#039;ve yet to puke or get bad stomach aches. Try it out and see if it works. I think a big bottle of them cost me 8 bucks..well worth it.<br /><br />And to the OP, after my last trip, 2cb is best enjoyed with others. It sucks when your so happy and there&#039;s no one to share the feelings with. I also found if anything starts going bad, just switch up what your doing and its very easy to get out of the bad mood within seconds. If you have a phone, go check out some pictures on there. I like to browse 500px.com and check out all the nature shots, very cool stuff.

				I know a lot of people love 2cb.<br /><br />But I am not sure if I am one of them<br /><br />Allow me to describe my 2cb trip story. I just tried once....<br /><br />So I took around 18-19 mg orally at 12am. After 1h30min I think I could feel the effects started. It was somehow weird. On one side I could enjoy the high and the music. I hardly had visuals. Yes, I did have them but I felt the dose was too small to really have something beautiful in front of my eyes. I felt I have to concentrate a lot on one point, after it I could see the objects moving, fractals and so on. But as I say, maybe my dose was too small. Nothing to compare to lsd. <br />I stayed at home on that day, I had quite a big body load, at times it was really annoying, I could not relax, I walked from one room into another of my flat and back. I wished the high to stop. The time was also flowing so and so slowly. After around 4-5 hours I could feel the trippy effects to start to fade away. It was a nice time, my body load disappeared and my whole body felt really relaxed like after smoking a good joint. Unfortunately at the same time I had to go to the toilet very often. My urine was white, I had a lot of it, WC visits were at intervals of 30min and it lasted the next 4-5 hours. It was somehow annoying.....<br />Also I had the feeling I cant fall asleep. I felt a bit nervous although my body was very relaxed. But after all I felt really quickly asleep.<br />This is how my only 2cb trip was.<br />And I dont know what to do next time. I still have some 2cb left (( Using benzos to relax the body and diminish the body load???<br /><br />@Blackya, sorry I wrote here too much but I think it is important you know that not every person is the same and the effects (especially of psychodrugs) can vary from person to person<br /><br />Anyway, a lot of fun with trying your 2cb )))

				Well I&#039;m currently coming down from my first exhilarating experience on 2-CB. (An 18-20 mg capsule) <br /><br />For me it was a bit like LSD only without the loss of ego or the intense visual hallucinations.&nbsp; There were none of the worries or the anxiety that can creep in while tripping on acid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pretty damned awesome in my view.

				I personally recommend doing a small amount of MDMA when doing the 2c-b trip. Don&#039;t get me wrong, 2c-b is pretty fuckin bad ass, but it was just that much better with a little MDMA.
