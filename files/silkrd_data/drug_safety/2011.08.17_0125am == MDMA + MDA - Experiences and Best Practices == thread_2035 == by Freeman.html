				I was reading up on the synergy between the two substances and it sounds like a really enjoyable time.&nbsp; Some people said it was like the best of both substances with little of the negatives.&nbsp; Typical dosage seems to be Init 100-150mg MDMA then 100-150mg of MDA as the MDMA begins to come on strong (the +1-+2 hour mark).&nbsp; There was also some speculation that some of the most popular &quot;classic&quot; ecstasy pills actually contained this combination.&nbsp; Has anyone tried this?&nbsp;

				imo the longer you can wait between mdma sessions the better, based on not much id say wait minimum 2 weeks between and 4 weeks would be better. post dosing 5htp could reduce that aswell

				Ok, after a lot of tests I can believe now that this what arrived from NL to me is a high quality MDMA.<br /><br />I have done some research and I&#039;m trying to explain what is going on - maybe I&#039;m wrong and maybe not.<br />Everything begins at 2007/2008 - depends on a region in Poland, when availability of high-quality product like a crystal MDMA or even good quality pills is a problem until now. It&#039;s hard to buy anyway.<br />For a last years I did not found MDMA based pill, always some shitty-based product.<br />(Few weeks ago, my friend bought 3 pills and seller says that it&#039;s best pill he ever had &quot;fucking awesome MDMA trip&quot;.<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/mesie_biale_zakrapiane_na_pomaranczowo__malopolska_2011_08.jpg<br />I took half and tried. It was NOT MDMA, but some shit 2C-B or pFPP based - who cares... I really don&#039;t like it and feel really bad so I&#039;m trying to forgot about it.)<br />So most people decided to take a ride on a drugs from RC market and they are doing this until now.<br />I think they are expecting now, trips like on a drugs from RC.<br />Okay for them, their choice.<br />But I believe, that quality drugs are more safety for human body that unknown RC drugs.<br />Let&#039;s take a look closer on bk-MDMA(Methylone).<br />I have observed that this one is a nice shot to turn on Loss of Magic effect, even if a trip is shorten then MDMA, they get it to much to keep effect during party or whatever...<br /><br /><br />So I have decided to make some experiments.<br />I will paste some quotes:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. No euphoric effect after MDMA? - Some tests on a girls.<br /><br />Yesterday I personally gave MDMA around 100mg dose to two girls<br />with a weight around ~55kg and 24 years old. So MDMA dose was okey<br /><br />These girls are not experienced MDMA feelings.<br />Note: they takes drugs from time to time - maybe two times in a year.<br />[..cut..]<br /><br />Unfortunately, these girls strongly says, that it is working no-euphoric<br />and only empathetical! ..for them.<br /><br />The funny thing is, that one girl who never tried MDMA, said that<br />bk-MDMA(Methylone) is better...<br />and second one, who tried MDMA many times, but few years ago,<br />said that&#039;s not the same as it should be.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t know what is going on, I&#039;m little bit dissapointed.<br />Maybe it&#039;s a real MDMA, but somekind of evolution, DNA<br />transcription is changing people, and they do not accept MDMA<br />(here) anymore. I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />BTW: I have observed that small amount of amphetamine ~50-70mg in<br />same time with MDMA 112mg increase effects.<br />1) People do not falling asleep and feel fine.<br />2) They want to talk with others...<br />3) They DO NOT EVER THINK about next dose!!!! (That&#039;s really okey.)<br />... but still there is no euphoric effect :(<br /><br />For this time I really don&#039;t know what to do, especially when<br />shitty bk-MDMA known as Methylone has better effects. WTF?!?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. MDMA+Amphetamine (small doses - tried myself)<br /><br />...<br />Lucky bast*rd!!!<br /><br />Well, yesterday I have also tried MDMA+Amphetamine mix.<br />But lower doeses that I really need - because I didn&#039;t have planned it<br />for this evening.<br /><br />So I took it as one shoot in a bomb(capsule). Mixed together,<br />something around 60mg of MDMA<br />and a 20mg of Amphetamine - that I get on the street.<br /><br />The mix was administrated orally - after sometime i felt okey,<br />without &#039;asleep effect&#039; - it was nice anyway.<br /><br />But amount of a mix was too low for me, to feel how the mix (75%<br />MDMA/25% Amphetamine) really works and today I can&#039;t rate or<br />describe a quality of this &quot;juice&quot;.<br /><br />.. still no euphory effect (bk-MDMA works fine).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. Program for recovery after Loss of Magic<br />(don&#039;t know if this will works)<br /><br />I thought about possibility of transcription of DNA, as previously<br />mentioned and I did some research.<br />I decided to take a try some theraphy on my rats(friends) and send<br />them all to Silas&#039;es recovery therapy program called: &quot;God bless<br />MDMA&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to give my patients 5-HTP and L-Dopa in a small doses<br />over a half a week.<br />After a short break, maybe full 3-days, I will give them 120-130mg<br />of pure-MDMA. These doeses I&#039;m going to apply even for a 20 years<br />old, with a weight around 50kg girl - still not sure, because it<br />might be dangerous, especially when she&#039;s gonna be fully loaded of<br />serotonine and dopamine after the program.<br /><br />So here are details for 10 days:<br /><br />at morning:<br />breakfast with Magnesium, Vitamin B-6, B-12 and C<br /><br />30 minutes after:<br />2x capsule (100mg?) of Keizen&#039;s 5-HTP - which contains 50mg of 5-<br />HTP and other Ingredients: Cellulose, Magnesium Stearate, Silicon<br />Dioxide, Gelatin (capsule).<br /><br />During a day at same time:<br />15-30 minutes of physical exercise program (increase effects of<br />L-Dopa)<br /><br />At night:<br />1x capsule (400mg) of &quot;DOPA Mucuna&quot; from Now Foods - it contains<br />120mg of L-Dopa<br />1x glass of quality Orange Juice - 200-300ml (see note bellow)<br /><br />Cons/Warnings/Dangerous (2):<br />- &quot;elevated levels of serotnin stored in dopaminergic neurons&quot;<br />- &quot;converted it to Dopamine, and stored it in serotonergic neurons!<br />Holy cow!&quot;<br />source: Bluelight.ru, shortlink: http://goo.gl/pDCPO<br /><br />Note from research (1):<br />- (L-Dopa) if the patient has a low level of carbon in his body,<br />then L-Dopa additionally should be administrated with<br />glucose/sugars to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).<br />Orange Juice should help in this case for all users.<br /><br /><br />In my opinion this does not help at all, especially when bk-MDMA<br />works fine. But would like to try it. The key to the success might<br />be sport!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. Placebo effect and new clean rats<br /><br />Okey I have three guys who are purely clean and they didn&#039;t tried<br />drugs yet. (~20-24 years old). <br />They are waiting for best moment :) So here it comes!<br /><br />I decided to make some experiment with them and<br />rest groups that failed previous working of MDMA. <br />I&#039;m going to give them on a closed party with their favorite music<br />MDMA+Amphetamine mix, but with a small amount of Amphetamine.<br />As a one shoot bomb: 100mg MDMA and 15-20mg Amphetamine<br /><br />Placebo 1: After 1 hour, I&#039;m going to open doors for 1st group<br />of previous tester and give them 5 minutes to talk with new one.<br />Then I&#039;ll apply them same mixture.<br /><br />Placebo 2: After next 1 hour, I&#039;m going to open doors,<br />but for 2nd group of previous tester. And I&#039;m going to give them<br />only 125mg of MDMA without Amphetamine!!!<br /><br /><br />And in a future I&#039;m also planning to do some test on a 3rd group<br />and give them pills that contains only MDMA 60-90mg.<br />This could be interesting, when I&#039;m going to give them pills<br />with a smile. After a while going to say: &quot;Hellooo, this is ecstasy&quot; :)<br />First I need to find a pills - hard to find some good stuff to make<br />some tests.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have also report from other users with same MDMA, that it was really OK, but different then bk-MDMA - no bliss and with smaller euphoria, but working perfect! Their feelings and whole the trip matches 100% the MDMA trip. But these are only 2 people, where each group(3) of unhappy testers have 3 persons.<br /><br />2 satisfied / 9 not satisfied<br /><br />Still there is a question ... what happen in Poland or with that people. Is there some shit in a food or WTF?<br />I didn&#039;t heard about something like that before. And I&#039;m going to find an answer and way to cure them.<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />Best regards
