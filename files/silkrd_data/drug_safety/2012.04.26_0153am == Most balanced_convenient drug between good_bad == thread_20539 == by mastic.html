				Hello girls and guys,<br /><br />I want to know what for you is the most balanced/convenient drug for you in terms of good/bad effects, just what is your sensation feelings when you are on it and the hours/days after the take, not what the medicinal science or whatever are saying.<br /><br />I like doing different drugs but with a bit of caution, just when i really want to have pleasures with friends or so...<br />The only drug i feel not really hurting my soul and mental health quickly is weed.<br />When i take coke i have the sensation to be in front of a wall very quickly in my mind i mean after a week-end with, it is enough to feel this several days. A bit lost in my mind, nervous, not fresh. With mdma this is the same, my mind is fucked for few days just for one roll, felling a bit depressed and strange in my body.<br />With opium i tried once, very pure himalayan i felt bad for two days i mean i can evenly remember something profund in my past...<br />LSD/mushrooms this is the same, feel not really normal for few days but it is a bit different because you thoughts are interesting, not frustrating like the other ones i listed.<br />The only one i clearly accept in low/mid/hi dosage without being fucked several days is weed!<br />I can smoke 5 days in a row like 6 joints per day and not having my mind completly fucked the hours after.<br />Alchol can be also very strange in your mind for several days after a long weekend drinking, i mean feeling drepressed.<br /><br />Weed for me is really the cleanest in your mind and body, the one i feel the less opressing my mind and in the sametime i can choose to let me go and feel the effect quite hardly.<br /><br />This won&#039;t even change my habits with &#039;hard&#039; drugs that i take with care but i feel it like that and you ?

				Well, for my body, I can tolerate repeated use of Marijuana and MXE. I&#039;ve been using both daily, with no noticeable effects the next day. Not to mention both last a short duration, which means neither has changed my daily routine at all.<br /><br />As for Mushies or LSD, the occasional weekend use is something I look forward too for the entire week. As opposed to MDMA, I actually feel amazing after consuming these drugs rather than drained or depressed. They leave a remarkably positive afterglow which can last a few days or even weeks after consumption.<br /><br />MDMA is worthwhile despite the rather nasty hangovers I receive from it&#039;s use. I&#039;m normally quiet and reserved, but MDMA really brings out my personality and gives me the confidence to say what I want. It&#039;s made me more comfortable with people and can make some really memorable nights. MDMA also has a shorter duration than mushies and LSD does, which is another factor to consider when comparing these drugs.<br /><br />DMT is just a god tier drug. It can create some of the most life-changing experiences in only a matter of minutes. If I ever felt the need to, I could drive home, smoke some DMT, and then return to work all within my 30 minute break and just continue working as if nothing had happened. But that would be irresponsible and would be disrespectful to the DMT.<br /><br />25i-NBOMe is sort of a mix between LSD and MDMA, it&#039;s like it&#039;s got several wonderful features of both drugs. It&#039;s duration is somewhere in between that of MDMA and LSD, and it gives me a slight afterglow but a bit of a hangover feeling to it. It&#039;s a bit confusing to explain for some reason, but I would definitely describe it as a good weekend drug.
