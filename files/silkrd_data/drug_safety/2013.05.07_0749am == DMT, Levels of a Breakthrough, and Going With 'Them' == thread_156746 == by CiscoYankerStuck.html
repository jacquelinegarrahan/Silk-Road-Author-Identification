				New DMT user here.

I haven&#039;t done so yet because I haven&#039;t felt ready for it (and was honestly horrified the first time they tried to get me to go).<br /><br />I feel I am ready to go for it on my next trip. Do any of y&#039;all more experienced users have advice on &#039;letting go&#039; of the body and going with them? Is it something you need to be mentally prepared for to be able to do, or is it something you can achieve by just smoking a larger dose?<br /><br />I feel as if there is another level of the breakthrough awaiting, sort of like a breakthrough within a breakthrough.<br /><br />And once achieved, same DMT advice as usual?

				my only advice is don&#039;t resist! go with the flow and try not to be too afraid or amazed. just soak it all up and enjoy the ride. nothing else you can really do anyway.

				Thank you. I finally mentally prepared myself to go away with them.<br /><br />I felt totally ready, and I inhaled the largest dose to date. What came next surprised me.<br /><br />I had the clearest most vivid breakthrough thus far and the space people were there. Normally, they&#039;re all mysterious and shit and want to show me crazy things or tell me to leave my body and fly away with them.&nbsp; This time, they were just there, and I was there with them, and they were all non-chalant, sort of like &quot;Uh, hey man, what&#039;s up.&quot; Then they started to show me the exterior of this house (it was a crazy hyperspace space-person type of house, but still just a house). I calmly observed this house trying to take it all in, but then that was it, nothing else. Just the exterior of this really cool house. Just the exterior of this house until it all started to fade away.<br /><br />I wonder if I missed something, or if there was more to this house than I knew? What was inside? Could I have willed my self to enter the house? I wanted to go in, but didn&#039;t want to exert my own influence on the experience.<br /><br />Or maybe, I felt like maybe the space people got sick of me not wanting to go with them on previous trips, and they were just sort of like &quot;here, look at this house&quot;, like they didn&#039;t really feel like bothering with me anymore.<br /><br />Or maybe they have a dry sense of humor? Like &quot;Oh man, this guy is actually ready to vacate his body this time, let&#039;s just show him this house.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway just wanted to vent/get this written down. IDK if anyone has any thoughts on this.<br /><br /><br />Also, anyone else have the entities watching/guarding over them while blasting off, like they&#039;re just watching you making sure you get through safely? It seems to be a recurring theme for me.

(smoke a smaller amount, start feeling crazy after a hit or two and they just let the trip ride from there.) going past the point of your intuition telling you youve had enough is the problem. but once youve been you understand its okay and that you will be taken care of.<br /><br />like you said, you lose concept of self/time/location.<br /><br />you physically go to another place and become one with that place and the entities inside of it.

				I&#039;ve been having good luck an Eclipse Vape (or Essential Vape).&nbsp; Apply a bic flame below until the DMT starts to boil and pull it away while inhaling &amp; repeat till gone :)<br /><br />About half the price of a GVG, and comes with a carrying case with room for extra vials (spice, herbs, etc)<br />

I was going to buy the GVG and I still might because I heard it made vaping DMT less harsh. I made a homemade vape but the smoke was way too harsh to keep down and I tried all day. For some reason with the sandwich method it&#039;s much easier to keep down. I just actually had the most intense rush yet a few minutes ago and ears were ringing louder than I&#039;ve ever noticed before. No real OEV but I did have very faint CEV similar to the ones I get on mushrooms but a bit more noticeable. I&#039;m in the trial stages of DMT trying to get my body used to it all before going too deep too soon but I&#039;m pushing further each time. DMT is just something else.

				A good trip makes you throw-up<br />You will have to vomit.<br />Your skin will itch like crazy for a few seconds.<br /><br />Best thing is to use with help from a friend.<br /><br />Put some powder in a long tube, put one end in your nose and let your friend blow on the other end of the tube.<br />Otherwise it is hard to take a good hit, you will stip inhaling if you have to do it alone.<br /><br />Inhale at the moment your friend starts to blow.<br />Scratch your head and skin, puke a bit and have the strangest dreams you ever head.<br /><br />And no I did not read Carlos de Casteneda.

It is very easy to do and it beats any other method hands down when you are used to it.<br />The sandwich one can be good too to try but it&#039;s nothing close.<br /><br />The beauty of &quot;the machine&quot; is that you get the DMT all in one hit and all at once. The more tokes you take the less the chance of a full &quot;breakthrough&quot; because the more time passes the less DMT is absorbed. With sandwich then it&#039;s almost impossible to not burn the DMT at last partially and some of it will anyway re-condense on the chamber.<br /><br />With &quot;the machine&quot; you need half the DMT you need with sandwich and with much better results. I think that all people that have been able to work up with this method fully will never turn back to anything else.

				Machine hands down.<br /><br />The only thing that can be better depending on individual tastes is the Volcano, but I personally still prefer the machine.<br /><br />Another hint for a better breakthrough is to do 2/3 threshold doses in lapses of about 20 minutes before the full dose. Much more intense experience and the breakthrough lasts longer (the total duration is not much longer but the comedown period is much reduced in this way and the breakthrough time takes almost all the trip; this in turn make the experience seem to last a lot more). I wanted to write this advice in the trip reports starting in June 1st but I guess I will anticipate it now.
