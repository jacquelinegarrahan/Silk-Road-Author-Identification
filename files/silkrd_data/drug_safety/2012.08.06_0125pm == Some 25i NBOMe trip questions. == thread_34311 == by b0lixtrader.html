				Would it be ok to smoke a little bit of herb before and during the trip or would it ruin the trip?<br /><br /><br />Just wondering because weed and mushrooms are a must for me.<br /><br />Also what to do during the trip?<br /><br />Never tried an RC that is suppose to have a very visual trip so don&#039;t know what to expect.<br /><br />Any input would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks

				Weed and 25i go together amazingly :) that&#039;s fine and will make it a bit more meditative. During the trip listen to music or watch something funny, you laugh at literally everything.

				You should be more than fine, they go together great in my opinion. Makes the trip very smooth and thought-provoking in my experience. I went sailing right at sunset last time I took both of them on a small little two person sailboat (I&#039;m a strong swimmer, a long time sailer, and I had a trip sitter with me) and it was one of the most profound experiences of my life. The sunset was beautiful with the sunlight reflecting on the water and shining lightly on the sail. Very visual trip for me. Music is a must. Have fun&nbsp; :)

				I enjoy sitting and reading religious texts but that&#039;s me. Music of course. Going for walks. <br /><br />Weed would absolutely be enjoyable :)

				Does anyone know if 25i will have any drug interactions with methylone? I&#039;m looking to try them together but want to make sure.

				I don&#039;t think it should, if you&#039;re talking about cross-tolerance or a bad reaction or something along those lines. You should be fine, but do some research over at Erowid and Bluelight first. Erowid might have some trip reports on the combination that could be beneficial to you.

But I would assume MDMA would have similar reactions so maybe I&#039;ll try that. I&#039;ll search bluelight too, I had completely forgotten about that.<br /><br />I just know that some of the 2c&#039;s have some bad reactions with MDMA and methylone, like 2c-t-7 and the 2c-t&#039;s in general because they have some sort of MAOI like properties.

I think you will be fine on 800. You can also take 2 400mg tabs, just space them about 30-45 minutes apart for a smoother come-up. Trip time on these is about 6-8 hours. <br /><br />I once had 550ug and it was very light, almost underwhelming and I&#039;m in the low hundreds. So unless you&#039;re 90lbs you probably wont get much from 400ug.

I&#039;ve always wanted to do this but have zero sailing experience and I&#039;m a poor swimmer.<br /><br />Though for me I find weed before or during the trip just makes me really scattered, paranoid and tired. I don&#039;t like it at all, much better to wait until the tail end to recapture a little of the magic.

				Yeah I find that weed helps bring back a little bit of the intensity when I&#039;m coming down. Also helps smooth out the come down.

				I found that weed would make my 25i trip much more powerful. Once while on 2.4 milligrams I smoked some and ended up with total ego death and turning into a dog. Yeah, I&#039;m serious. A dog.
