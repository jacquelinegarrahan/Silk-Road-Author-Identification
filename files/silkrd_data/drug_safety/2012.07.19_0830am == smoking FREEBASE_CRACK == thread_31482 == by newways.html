				Regarding the way people smoke it.<br /><br />Let us agree that smoking freebase cocaine and or crack are one of the most EXTREME INTENSE forms of using drugs. In it&#039;s use, in it&#039;s effect, the consequences, etc etc.<br /><br />What bothers the living fuck out of me having been reading here on the forums are the methods being suggested of preparing it and smoking it. Personally I have been smoking on and off for about 8 years.<br /><br />There is not a high that is comparable when it is good quality and smoked properly in the least harmful way. After those years I would HARDLY call myself an expert. I have smoked it primarily from a hashpipe with ash, and or a cup with tinfoil (rough side up) also with ash.<br /><br />ONCE did I smoke it from a glass tube pipe and that was in North America on a visit. What I have noticed is that almost everyone in Europe smokes with an ash layer. Almost everyone in North America smokes with a glass pipe.<br />Regardless of clean preparation I would like to put emphasis on the way it is smoked. One with half a brain and some common fucking logic sense could easily see the connection in cleaner smoking between cigarette ash and just the pure substance itself.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I have been so used to smoking it with ash (severely having depended on what my surroundings have set as an example and a habit) I would really REALLY like to get my hands on a proper glass pipe and prevent what harm I can from not inhaling additional crap. What I do not fully know is exactly how it works. I know of some people using multiple screens in a hash pipe and not using any ash. This prevents from the coke sifting through and a lot going to waste. Now, what I would like to know is; is a screen necessary in a glass pipe. From what it looks like it seem people just jab a hit or rock of crack at the end of the glass pipe and smoke it pure. One of the pipes I ordered has a bottleneck to prevent everything sliding down.<br /><br />Someone with experience, if you would be so kind to shed some more light on the subject it would be GREATLY appreciated. This form of use is harmful to begin with and has many consequences if used let alone abused. ESPECIALLY in regards to long term.<br /><br />Some pictures would also be amazingly helpful.<br /><br />Many thanks in advance!<br /><br />Sincerest regards<br />

				I always thought that a piece of brillo/steel wool was placed into glass tube to use as a screen?

				OP i think the glass pipe your talking about are actually glass one hitters for weed. Real crack pipes are well just a glass pipe with nothing else.&nbsp; Hence like the post above people use steel wool or a peice of small brilo pads and stick them in the pipe.<br /><br />The bottle neck thing is more of a weed pipe aka chillums...unless glassblowers are actually making crack pipes now...<br /><br />Come to think of it, i do have a pipe that when i recieved as a freebie with an order of another weed pipe looks like you can smoke some hard out of it...weird

				straight glass pipe, wire wool, not to thin, about the same as brillo pad but without the soap, once you try it properly, u will never go back to the ash method

				I happen to know that you can get the proper pipes and chore boy copper scourer pads on on a certain UK sales site that is named after a forest in South America. You can also get them on the American version but postage is dear. Look for &#039;rose in glass tube&#039; or &#039;love flower&#039;. About 60p a pop. What I want to know is- if I had a tube with the chore boy (burned and rolled0 in it and then the gear, would I hold the flame at the end of the pipe and inhale the heat through or would I hold the flame under the glass at the place where the goods are? First way sounds like it could burn the mouth off you....
