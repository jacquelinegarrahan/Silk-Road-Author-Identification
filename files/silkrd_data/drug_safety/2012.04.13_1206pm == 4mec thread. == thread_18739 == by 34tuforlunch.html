				So I recently got 25 grams of 4mec and since their is not a lot a lot of info out their on it I thought I would make a thread explaining my experiences with it a bit.<br /><br />So first of all 4mec is a lot like MDMA but you get a lot more energy and the high is no were as long. I&#039;m a non smoker and I do coke about 4 times a year without any erge to use again. I would consider myself a person with a decent resistance to addiction. 4 mec is the only drug&nbsp; other than weed I have ever taken 2 days in a row. The main reason im making this is to warn people of its addictiveness.&nbsp; The high is very short lived. Snorting 100mg will keep you peaking an hour then the crash will start to kick in. Its the only drug ive tried that gives me a urge to despose.&nbsp; Stay away from this drug I just sold 20 grams. All I had left after a week to someone for less than what I paid because I need it out of my life. Stick to MDMA over this thing any day. Also sorry if this is very badly written im still comming down of a very heavy dose.

				I tried this shit, it&#039;s just a bad version of MCAT and it&#039;s touted as a replacement for Mephedrone which it really isn&#039;t. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s like MDMA at all, no rolls, no love just a shitty speedy feeling and a dirty come down.

				<br />Ive smoked lots of crack, and never felt any addiction, or withdrawl.&nbsp; I would catch myself acting like an asshole and have to correct my own behavior, I&#039;m pretty good at that. <br /><br />&nbsp;I was on a morphine pump in the hospital, when I broke my leg in three places (both bones and right above my ankle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway the withdrawals where awful for a 15yo young man.&nbsp; thought there where worms and snakes crawling on me.<br /><br />&nbsp;So I ordered some MepheDrone from a new vendor (ioffer last summer).&nbsp; &nbsp;What shows up a white crystal labeled&nbsp; 4-mec.&nbsp; &nbsp; I didnt know what it was.&nbsp; so I went easy layed out a 50mg crushed it and snorted it.&nbsp; I was smoking Skunk1 a very speedy Sativa Weed as well.&nbsp; When the two chems hit I was talking a mile a minute.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to McDonalds w/ some friends and I was acting so weird a McDonalds Secuirty guard sat at the table across from us and just stared at me.&nbsp; I was speed crazy high for hours.<br /><br />I&nbsp; layed off it after that thinking could it be MDPV by mistake.&nbsp; Then one night I tried it again and this time it was&nbsp; allright.&nbsp; lasted about 15 minutes or so, and compelled to redose.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I didnt think much of the stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;But soon In was pulling all nighters,&nbsp; redose after redose.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I decided to order more&nbsp; &nbsp; I ordered 50 grams, I sold some to friends but I snorted more than I sold.&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent several nights in a porn psychosis.&nbsp; When id go outside in the day every woman I would look at would turn intoa&nbsp; porn film.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wow I was fucked up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I havent had any since I klled that 50gram bag.&nbsp; &nbsp;The urge to order more is there but my nose still burns, and that is enough to remind me not to do 4-mec again.<br /><br /><br />
