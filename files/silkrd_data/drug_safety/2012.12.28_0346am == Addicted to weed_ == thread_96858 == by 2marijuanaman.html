				Hello. I have a life problem; I think I&#039;m mentally addicted to weed.<br /><br />Weed&#039;s always worked differently for me than my friends. I&#039;ve never complained getting high by myself, in fact there&#039;s more for me. Not that I&#039;m antisocial, but here&#039;s my problem: I&#039;m willing to lie, steal or ANYTHING for that next blunt. I&#039;ll even smoe spice, make it homemade. Blends that might cause panic in others give me slight buzz, nothing too strong...<br /><br />When I&#039;m sober, half of my thoughts consist of weed. I&#039;m in mental torture. How can I go through life without weed and be happy? I&#039;m not an addict in other areas of my life, surprisingly. I&#039;m just crrazy for weed though. I tried heroin once; it wasn&#039;t bad but weed is honestly more euphoric. Heroin can compliment weed, but as far as euphoria goes, marijuana wins a one hit knockout on heroin for me.<br />And heroin is the runner up. Speed, acid, that stuff just can&#039;t compare...<br /><br />Has anyone else gone through this? When I&#039;ve smoked socially, people say I&#039;m &quot;weird like I&#039;m having an epiphany&quot;. My other friends sometimes put other drugs, like alcohol, on par with weeed. I can&#039;t comprehend such insanity.<br />As far as drugs go..... there&#039;s weed and then there&#039;s all that other crap. That&#039;s just my personal opinion and brain chemistry... thoughts?&nbsp;

				Like you said it&#039;s probably just a mental thing man. I recently went out of town for family xmas time and wasn&#039;t able to get any chronic before I left... Yea it was shitty, but nothing I couldn&#039;t deal with. I honestly didn&#039;t get any withdraws, depression, or any of that shit (I don&#039;t even believe in marijuana withdraws). I just... didn&#039;t have weed to smoke, it wasn&#039;t even on my mind because I knew I couldn&#039;t get any where I was. I don&#039;t fiend for weed at all, and I don&#039;t see how other people do. I&#039;ve been a daily weed smoker for 5+ years and when there is a dry spell, I really don&#039;t care, I just look forward to when I can get it again.<br /><br />All I&#039;ve done is follow this principle: <br /><br />DON&#039;T LET YOUR LIFE REVOLVE AROUND MARIJUANA. HAVE MARIJUANA REVOLVE AROUND YOUR LIFE.

I smoked copious amounts of high quality bud, easily an oz a week if not more. I found myself smoking tobacco through my bong on occasions where I&#039;d run out of bud. God only knows why the fuck I did that. I was so heavily addicted to pot that I was hospitalized a total of 8 times during my years of smoking, where my body would shut down and start using muscle instead of fat for energy. On the 8th occasion, my doctor said to me that if I don&#039;t stop what I&#039;m doing, I was going to die. FUCK! After I left hospital, I looked into different ways some people had overcome their addiction. I eventually talked to a family friend who recommended I try Hypnosis. He was a cigarette smoker for 20 yrs and after just one session, found he hated cigarettes and has to this day, never smoked since. Once I found a Hypnotist I was comfortable with, she said it would take about 4 sessions to achieve what our goal was. The one very important rule I had to follow was I had to really want to give up smoking pot sub-conscientiously and not just say I wanted to give up. Hypnotherapy will ONLY WORK if deep down inside, you truly want to quit. Four sessions later and I couldn&#039;t believe that the urge and temptation to have a bong, which had ruled my life for over a decade, was totally gone. It&#039;s been over 15 yrs since I stopped and to this day, I have never touched it again, nor would I. I can promise you that if you truly want to give it up sub-conscientiously and are 100% committed, Hypnotherapy will work for you. I&#039;m living proof.&nbsp; :)

				I have to agree with you, you do have an addiction for weed. You are not the only one. I know a couple of people who went to rehab for their addiction to weed. They are really glad that they got of it, they are happier. <br /><br />Addiction sounds so scary and we all have images of what it is, but I think the truth is that it can happen so easily. <br /><br />Good luck to you and wishing you strength and support.

No two of us are exactly the same, each of us individuals. While some people, yourself included, are able to use a drug daily and not get pissed off or anxious for a smoke when suddenly the supply is interrupted for a number of days and&nbsp; there are others in this world that when faced with the same problem of running out of weed, the thought of how and where to get some more will consume their thoughts until they next smoke. This is a terrible situation as there are other things in life, besides drugs, to occupy our time but finding the balance between using and not using is not as easy as some may think.

				I am a bit addicted too, I get anxious when running out of weed. It&#039;s an everyday habit of course you ll get some mental addiction. <br />Currently dry for 3 days not a big problem, I had much worse time with nicotine withdrawals, but I have some difficulty getting to sleep. The whole last year I smoke before sleeping and I have some trouble sleeping sober. <br />The only advice I can give&nbsp; you if you really want to give it up, you need to change a lot of things in your life, break the habits connected to weed and start new ones. If you use to smoke while playing videogames for example stop playing videogames find something else that you enjoy. It&#039;s very hard removing a habit while everything around reminds you of it. <br />Good luck.

				Thanks for your support guys, I guess I just didn&#039;t really realize marijuana is addictive. It seems like a pretty harmless drug, and didn&#039;t have and physical problems except lethargy. My problem is this : I deep down wish I could smoke forever. But I can&#039;t, and I am frustrated. It&#039;s literally my instincts telling me: &quot;this activates dopamine, it&#039;s good! so you better get as much as possible!&quot;<br />I can&#039;t imagine having to quit forever. But I also can&#039;t lie anymore and pretend I control my weed use. <br /><br />Would it really be so bad to take marijuana everyday for depression and anxiety? The question is how could one function stoned all day? Is there any alternative to marijuana anyone would recommend? I take vyvanse which helps with depression and lethargy. I&#039;m trying to get xanax with my psychiatrist appointment, but xanax is nowhere near as good as weed.

				Too much of anything is a bad thing. Ive been addicted to weed before and it caused me real discomfort, I couldnt eat without it, and I began vomiting like once a day for some reason. Now I do my best to moderate which means when I smoke, I only take a couple of puffs as opposed to smoking a whole joint or blunt or what have you. When its time to celebrate I enjoy as much as I can handle and never more. I hope you find that helpful...there is hope that you may be able to still smoke it without going overboard. But weed can be powerful and it can take over peoples lives if they let it.

I can understand wanting to keep using, it feels good. It is quite sneaky how the mind works, how it justifies and how blind it can be to what is going on. It is difficult to actually see what the full effect and the cost are.<br /><br />Is the root cause of your depression and anxiety addressed? If not, you will keep trying to find solutions outside yourself. That won&#039;t work and you could end up on a slippery slope with other addictions or your depression and anxiety could worsen. <br /><br /><br />

				I guess your right. I guess the reason I&#039;m depressed is social isolation. I got tested for asbergers syndrome and they said I was borderline but not quite.

YOU have to make a commitment to either quit forever or continue smoking as per normal, and stick to it religiously. Addicts to any drug are not capable of just having a little each day. It&#039;s all or nothing for an addict. It can be hard to face the inevitable and make some significant changes to your life, taking you way out of your comfort zone and what you&#039;re used to. However, it&#039;s getting started which is the hardest step IMO. Once you start and see/feel the benefits of not smoking, that can inspire you to persevere with it all and really make some inroads towards achieving your ultimate goal. Look inside yourself and gather all your strength to overcome this hurdle in your life. Any number of people can help you but in the end, it&#039;s going to be you who will be the deciding factor in your endeavor to quit smoking weed. I&#039;m living proof that someone who never thought it was possible to stop smoking pot can in fact make the necessary life changes and not smoke pot again, ever!

Asperger<br />I have worked with people with Autism. In general people with Asperger&#039;s Syndrome want to be social and connect with others. However, they find they don&#039;t have the skills to do so.When you say you feel isolated it tells me you do want to connect but just don&#039;t know how. And probably have had lots of experiences were it was difficult and you were rejected. It is not easy. But I do want to give you hope that it is possible to connect in a way that will suit you and makes you happy.&nbsp; Get specialized help, if that is possible. It will make things easier for you.<br /><br />2. Social isolation<br />You wrote that you can be content with being alone when you use weed. The thing with that is, it could keep you from being social (meeting new people, friends and or girlfriends, and being able to practice social skills) and keep you in the vicious cycle of using because you are lonely and being lonely because you are using.<br /><br />3. Stop using when having a girlfriend<br />This is also a solution outside yourself solution. If you aren&#039;t happy, nothing will really fix that. Also it wouldn&#039;t be fair to the girl. For a healthy relationship you need to be able to take good care of yourself.<br /><br />4. Weirdness<br />Yes, we all are weird in our own way. I want to cheer you on acting in how you are made. Celebrate who you are, with quirks and all.<br />I do want to question if you are on drugs (or tobacco or alcohol) if that is truly you. It is mind, body and emotionally altering.<br /><br /><br />You will find your way.&nbsp; :)

				Weeds no joke I have smoked for almost 10 years now. <br /><br />Memory is shot, cognitive too. Did lots of E too though for about 1.5 yrs.<br /><br />Quitting is not easy, psychologically the addiction can be very powerful.<br /><br />I know someone who quit opiates and stims etc and can&#039;t quit weed when he says he&#039;s going to. <br /><br />A lot of it has to do with the social context and connotation but we forget it is indeed a drug.<br /><br />I dont really have any advice. I havent smoked in a few weeks cause of lack of funds and I feel just fine and after a few days mental withdraw i seemed ok. But once I have some $ again I&#039;ll likely smoke and I likely don&#039;t wanna stop deep down inside even though I know its bad for me and I try to not make poor health choices anymore.

				Just make sure that you constantly have weed and don&#039;t worry man, just chill and smoke when you need to. Just a tiny bit every day as a medicine for your mind.<br /><br />Spend only what you can afford on weed or grow some.<br /><br />Make sure you still do things, stoned or not.<br /><br />Don&#039;t smoke all day, don&#039;t smoke for an hour or two before bed.<br /><br />Keep a regular pattern of only smoking a tiny little bit 1,2 or 3 times a day. But make sure that when most every day you get up in the morning you don&#039;t smoke for like 8hrs no matter what.

				Addition is exacerbated by high bio-availability. Smoking a joint means the stone comes on in minutes, but hitting the bong with Tobacco can hit you in seconds. You might find yourself chasing this dragon. <br /><br />But it&#039;s also important to note that if you are chopping up with tobacco, and don&#039;t enjoy smoking weed straight... you are probably mentally and physically addicted to the tobacco too. Nicotine is WAY more addictive than weed. It&#039;s the cocaine of legal drugs - always wanting another hit - all day long. <br /><br />Give up nicotine first, and you&#039;ll find the weed easier to kick. Easy said than done, of course. <br /><br />

				Damn right don&#039;t smoke tobacco with your weed if you can help it.<br /><br />But if you are addicted to nicotine then make sure you maintain your addiction by smoking tabs throughout the day to keep yourself off the weed.<br />Then maybe mix a little baccy in in the evening. Or just smoke a ciggy if you need to do something.<br />Smoke a ciggy to get off to sleep.<br /><br />Even better than ciggy&#039;s health wise would be nicotine gum, the strong version gives you a good hit, or try e-cigarettes for health.<br /><br />Apparently snorting snuff is also a damn good hit.<br /><br />Most of all, just have fun and enjoy your drugs.

I guess the reason I&#039;m depressed is social isolation. I got tested for asbergers syndrome and they said I was borderline but not quite. I&#039;m 18 though maybe in college I&#039;ll be lucky enough to find a girl who to be with. Maybe then I&#039;ll be happy without weed...<br />when I&#039;m high I don&#039;t even crave socialization anymore, I become content with being alone. My whole life I&#039;ve had a problem with being friendly yet uncharismatic. I guess I&#039;m just &#039;weird&#039; but I think were all individuals, whats so weird about acting way you were made? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had a couple of thoughts when reading your reply:<br /><br />1. Asperger<br />I have worked with people with Autism. In general people with Asperger&#039;s Syndrome want to be social and connect with others. However, they find they don&#039;t have the skills to do so.When you say you feel isolated it tells me you do want to connect but just don&#039;t know how. And probably have had lots of experiences were it was difficult and you were rejected. It is not easy. But I do want to give you hope that it is possible to connect in a way that will suit you and makes you happy.&nbsp; Get specialized help, if that is possible. It will make things easier for you.<br /><br />2. Social isolation<br />You wrote that you can be content with being alone when you use weed. The thing with that is, it could keep you from being social (meeting new people, friends and or girlfriends, and being able to practice social skills) and keep you in the vicious cycle of using because you are lonely and being lonely because you are using.<br /><br />3. Stop using when having a girlfriend<br />This is also a solution outside yourself solution. If you aren&#039;t happy, nothing will really fix that. Also it wouldn&#039;t be fair to the girl. For a healthy relationship you need to be able to take good care of yourself.<br /><br />4. Weirdness<br />Yes, we all are weird in our own way. I want to cheer you on acting in how you are made. Celebrate who you are, with quirks and all.<br />I do want to question if you are on drugs (or tobacco or alcohol) if that is truly you. It is mind, body and emotionally altering.<br /><br /><br />You will find your way.&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Certainly when I&#039;m high that&#039;s not me. When I&#039;m high I don&#039;t completely understand whats going on at all, so how are others supposed to understand me either? <br />I&#039;m getting a gram of akb-48 tomorrow. Typically I binge until I&#039;m out and frantically search for more, this time I&#039;ll try to not binge as much... God knows I&#039;m in for another sleeplessness night. I&#039;m not sure about weed but spice is definitely somewhat addictive, I actually threw up a cup of tea earlier. Can&#039;t seem to eat more than a few chips all day... My stomach hurts but food doesn&#039;t sound good...

				While in college I smoked weed pretty much everyday, and I definitely noticed that it affected me in a far worse way than my peers... it pretty much makes me a socially inept zombie. You get caught in cycles like that, where you keep doing it and don&#039;t realize all the shit it&#039;s causing to fall down around you.<br /><br />But that&#039;s the same thing for every compound, every drug. Everyone&#039;s brain is going to fire differently and everyone&#039;s going to be pulled in by one thing or another. Whether it&#039;s alcohol, weed, tobacco... even caffeine can cause more damage than you realize and shit, I still drink like 4 - 8 sodas a day. <br /><br />So you have to be able to set yourself aside and look objectively at the things in your life, at the substances in your life and whether they are truly a detriment or a positive aspect of your life. And then you just gotta either keep &#039;em in your life, or exclude yourself. It took me failing out of college to realize what weed ( and to a lesser extent ) alcohol made me into. It sucks, but things get better as long as you realize what&#039;s happening.

				&nbsp;8)<br />Hey, kudos for your honesty, especially to yourself. Having toked for 24+years (16 of those years EVERY day) there are a couple of suggestions I could make. One is, and someone else said this a couple of posts up, is to find something to fill the void being not-high leaves. Some people learn to play a musical instrument, I enjoyed reading the Bible and lots of other books. Another idea, also mentioned a few posts back, is DO NOT USE TOBACCO! Your brain will associate the pot high with the tobacco high, and get the craving for one mixed up with the craving for the other.<br /><br />What has worked for me recently is a bit odd: when I&#039;d get high, I would then hit some Salvia divinorum immediately after. Something about S. Divinorum is the way it does NOT bind to the opiate receptors in your brain (I think they&#039;re called mu-receptors). I have heard it referred to (by medical types) as being anti-addictive. Even though I like S. Divinorum&#039;s effects, craving it is probably the last thing I do - for example, I&#039;ve had a pipe with a full hit of Salvia in it for 14+ months, and I find that I keep blowing off hitting it for another day over &amp; over &amp; over. And that&#039;s just the high part, I&#039;ll not get into what she told me (she being Salvia).<br /><br />Lastly, do not despair. Weed is not near as bad as anything else. Try resisting the urge to light up for 1 hour longer than normal, then after a time (couple of weeks of so) go 2 hours before you light up. If the urge you have is bad enough for you to steal or whatever, then at least trail down gradually. If needed, go to a counselor, as someone else remarked, everyone is different - I&#039;ll jones after 3-5 days for a day or two, then I start to forget about it. Hang in there!<br />

Like other said u deep down wanna stop u can. its only a Mental thing with weed, you may get somewhat anxious but no WD&#039;S , U might need to see a doc about being put on a Medication for nervs and anxiety..

				Sorry, but I&#039;ve got to question the fact that you say you&#039;ve been hospitalized 8 times because of cannabis- the doc told you that you were going to die- you&#039;ve said you smoked 1 oz a week- that&#039;s 4g per day. I&#039;m amazed nobody has questioned the validity of this? If what you say is true, then you must have some specific other medical problems that are exasperating the negative effects of weed, or, more likely, you are in a country with very negative views on any drugs- Singapore, I remember going to a doctor with my two muslim friends in India who had stomach complaints (very common- many Indians live with the problem)on finding out they smoked charas daily, 1 or 2 tolas daily (10 or 20g daily), he informed them they would die if they didn&#039;t stop!<br />Yes, weed is physically and mentally addicting, yes skunk has made it more common, but when I hear of people going into rehab for weed, I just give up!!!!! It is in their best interest to foist that attitude and propagate it. It is all extra revenue for them- there is a massive industry thriving on peoples drug use. What happened to the &quot;old stiff upper lip&quot;. Do you think those strong spirited men who climbed out of the safety of their trench to get mowed down with their best friends and neighbors by machine guns would have signed into rehab for a cannabis &quot;addiction&quot;????? What has happened to individual inner strength of character, self will. etc. People who moan about not being able to give up smoking tobacco or weed should get themselves a full on 10g a day heroin habit, then talk about their weed &quot;addiction&quot;!!! Everything is relative, but I truly beleive this weed &quot;addiction&quot; business has been blown out of all proportion!

				Yeah man, if you can&#039;t quit tobacco then at least stop mixing it with weed! The nicotine rush hits you in seconds and is a reinforcer.<br />The stoned from the weed&nbsp; kicks in later and can be powerful depending on strain or type.<br />In spliffs you probably smoke more than you really need. Less is more especially with powerful skunk type varieties.<br />Try just a little bit in a bong or pipe and see how long you can hold that buzz for. Don&#039;t smoke anymore until you no longer feel&nbsp; the last hit. <br />Might be 3 or 4 hours, you&#039;d be surprised at how much a little can effect you if you keep your tolerance down.<br /><br />When I am using marijuana to its best potential I am not smoking massive spliffs all day. Just a tiny little bit in a bong or pipe or one-skinner to relax after a longish day.<br />That is they key also. Do not wake and bake as it makes it harder to push through and get lots done. Also you need to get your body used to not having weed after a certain time like say 6pm.<br />If you do this then you will soon find that not only do you have more energy through the day but that it also extends into the evening when you can relax and still have a bit of stoned energy to be slightly productive. <br />Once you have this cracked and you are eating and sleeping at regular times you will find it easier to find that odd thing that is more important than smoking weed in the evening to do. So sometimes you will find yourself having little or no weed that day. Saving it for the next night instead.<br />Maintain this discipline and things will get allot better.<br /><br />Hey, at least its not Crack!&nbsp; :)

				I use to be addicted, smoking every single day. I moved to another town so didnt have any contact with dealers for a while, and it gave me a moment of clarity and suddenly I had escaped and was free, I now realise all the days I wasted of my life on that drug. Now days I feel no desire atall to smoke, its a nice feeling. So as someone said, cold turkey.

				I&#039;ve smoked weed off and on for about 5 years now, and most of the &quot;on&quot; time would be a daily ritual of smoking a bowl at night and then going to sleep.&nbsp; After a while I had a hard time sleeping without it.&nbsp; But I never feel like I have been addicted to weed.&nbsp; I just like to indulge often (almost daily still to this day).&nbsp; But the thing is without it I can function fine, I can quit it cold turkey any time with no real withdrawal effects.&nbsp; Weed is such a nice drug for that reason, if you become very dependent on it, it&#039;s probably 100% mental.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which is good, compared to something like heroin which is much harder to quit when you have to deal with feeling like death on the way out of it, and never really being able to get over the craving aspect.
