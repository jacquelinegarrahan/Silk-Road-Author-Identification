				I&#039;ve always bought smoke thru friends I&#039;ve known, and never gone thru SR, and I&#039;m ready to try some good stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure on the type of smoke I&#039;d like, and would like to ask for suggestions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of Skunk #1 (And a lot of southern border compressed brick), and really like the skunk, and would like to order that, but I&#039;m not sure what category that falls under and would like some suggestions on ordering (Indica, Sative...etc).<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m looking for something I can use when I get home from work.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to be level headed while around a lot of people or working.&nbsp; Just looking for something I can relax with with a beer or two after a long day<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m does anyone have suggestion on vaporizers?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks

				For me, indicas stimulate the body and are more sedative, while sativas stimulate the mind and are less tiring than the former. I don&#039;t know what your work schedule is, but if you&#039;re looking for an evening smoke I&#039;d recommend something on the indica side.<br /><br />Whats your quantity and budget? Might be able to recommend a particular listing.<br /><br />All the ganj I&#039;ve gotten off the road has been dank as hell, really no wrong choices!

				Sativa you can still function during the day and is sort of a &#039;thinking&#039; stone<br />Indica is basically couch lock. Duurrrr I&#039;m stoned and zoned out to this cartoon for 3hrs

				I recommend LexiSadie if you are in the US and looking for small amounts. The nugs are pricey but go a long way cause theyre so potent. Every strain has been the most delicious on the Road by far and all very enjoyable. Like others mentioned, look for an indica if you wanting relaxing mellow strain generally. Cant go wrong with the LS kush or platinum kush. Theyre some of the best buds and hit hard plus are good for stress relief. I just wish I could afford them more often.

				I&#039;ve tried most of the bud on SR and for the most part, Tahoe OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and Fleetwood OG (muskabuzz&#039;s kush) are some of the best indicas around, and many vendors carry them (except the Fleetwood). They all give you the basic indica effect of sedation and a body buzz, while at the same time stimulating the mind for a satisfying &quot;head change&quot; reminiscent of more sativa-leaning hybrids.

				Is blue cheese an indica? I can&#039;t seem to get a straight answer. I know it&#039;s a hybrid and has some sativa in it. I&#039;m seeing some people it feels like a sativa, others saying it&#039;s like indica. I&#039;ve looked on google. Anyone know? lol

				Not even kidding, last night I smoked half a blunt of Blue Dream I just bought and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been so high in my entire life. It was a &quot;Help me jesus!&quot; kind of high. Highly recommended. (no pun intended)<br /><br />Special thanks to NorCal420HookUp!!<br /><br />sdesu<br />

				you&#039;ll want indicas<br /><br />try kushes, purps, those are all indies.<br /><br />as for a vape: go for a no2, or a mflb. MFLB is great, portable, 5 second heat up, and lasts for a while. highly recommended
