				Alright so I have a rather extensive drug history behind me, around 70+ taken so far.<br />No, I am not trying to boost my own ego, was simply saying I have plenty of experience and knowledge<br />considering I love researching ^_^. Now my question is what is the big deal with stimulants, meaning meth,<br />mdpv, amphetamine, crack.....etc.<br /><br />Now I love my drugs and all but stimulants FUCKING SUCK! Compared to things like mdma, mushrooms, and lsd. Stimulants are as awful as alcohol. Honestly, I do not understand how people find enjoyment in them.<br />I can BARELY feel stimulants, I feel the come down hard as all hell, but the actual effects I just don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />How can one put the term &quot;Euphoria&quot; with being focused as fuck....<br /><br />Meth - Fucking Sucks.<br />Crack - Fucking Sucks.<br />LSD - Fucking Amazing.<br />MDMA - Was Amazing, until I got nothing (expanded thoughts) from it anymore.<br />Mushrooms - Sketchy as FUUUUAAARKKK.....but third eye moment is amazing...<br /><br />Basically any drug that has &quot;mind expanding property&#039;s&quot; is amazing.<br /><br />Which brings us back to the question, HOW can you find Heroin great or meth great<br />when there&#039;s lsd, shrooms, mdma, and mda? Ok, so you say heroin is great because it<br />makes you feel warm with a sense of well being, well guess what step mother fuckers<br />so does all the good drugs I mentioned above with out the nasty sides...and they can actually<br />promote leading an amazing life....unlike Heroin where you just sit around not doing a damn thing.<br />Like pot....waste of time and body damage. Alright, but meth gives you confidence and the ability to<br />talk without thinking twice about what the other may think, well guess what MOTHA FUAAAARKERS<br />so does mdma, mda, lsd, and shrooms.<br /><br />SO WHAT IN THE HOLY FUAAAAARK is your reasoning behind taking such fowl drugs and CONVINCING yourself that you actually enjoy them....<br /><br /><br /><br />....FUAAAAARK, I&#039;M DONE! (all of you point at me with a serious face &quot;HE&#039;S DOOONE!&quot;)

				For one that enjoys psychedelics as much as you do, you sure are close-minded, don&#039;t give the rest of us a bad name please. Different people have different tastes so they do different drugs, it&#039;s pretty much that simple.

				lol im not closed minded at all, just extremely blunt and to the point, but how is it that simple? Considering I should love Meth since it releases a shit ton of dopamine, but I do not, I do not feel any &quot;pleasure&quot; that is apparently felt when doing such stimulants, for what ever reason. <br /><br />I also do not really understand peoples logic on doing those type of drugs to &quot;cope&quot; with their current reality, I mean if one is doing heroin or meth or what ever it may be to &quot;cope&quot; with reality, wouldn&#039;t they want to &quot;fix&quot; their reality with a psychedelic instead? Why treat a problem when you can cure a problem.<br /><br />I never did really understand uneducated drug use.....all I get from it is that people took what they learned as kids (eat what ever is given to them without asking questions of the possible side effects) and associated it with drug use. <br /><br />~BUT THEN AGAIN, I i do not understand why people feel the need to NOT educate themselves using the computer.....considering the amount of knowledge it contains....ok actually I do understand why, but I felt like ranting for a minute ;) hehe.

				I get what your trying to get at here. However, for me (my favorite drug is Shrooms), I see stimulants as getting stuff done drugs. <br />These help make it through the last couple of hours of a long shift at work, or get that report that&#039;s due done tonight.<br />I may be wrong in this, but I feel a lot of people start with stimulants for the above reasons then get hooked.<br />As far as&nbsp; Heroin, I don&#039;t know never done it.

				I went through this conversation in my teen years with my friends. During the late 90s, meth was everywhere and all of my friends were into it. I never tried it and I didn&#039;t get it so I tried to find out why.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I gathered:<br />Some people don&#039;t enjoy mdma, shrooms, lsd or &#039;mind altering&#039; substances at all. The anxiety from what they think will happen (or did happen to them before) is so great, they have no &#039;pull&#039; to psychedelic drugs at all.<br />Next, some people don&#039;t get much experience from the drugs you listed. Whether it be shitty drugs, interactions, brain chemistry problems, not everyone has a good time on mdma or shrooms. When I first heard that, I couldn&#039;t understand it until many years later. I am sensitive to stimulants in their physical effects (blood pressure, vasoconstriction, jittery) but I don&#039;t get much from stimulants either. Probably why I never had the desire for meth. Everyone&#039;s chemistry really is different but add in pre-conceived fears and that makes a lot of people not expand on their drug research. This week at work, I had 2 people tell me &quot;no way&quot; when asked about acid or shrooms, just out of fear of hallucinating. These same 2 enjoy coke and meth very much.<br /><br />1 of them was recently introduced to mdma and 6-apb and is starting to open up a little bit in the way of mind-altering drugs (220mg produced visuals and he enjoyed it)<br /><br />All things are relative. I have seen meth heads who hate mdma and I&#039;ve seen candy kids who hate meth. (effect-wise, not personal-wise). <br /><br />mdma, shrooms, mda, and lsd are not downers. For the millions of people who enjoy downers, heroin or similar is what they&#039;re going for. A lot of them want the relaxation/slowed down pace.

				Maybe I prefer stimulants because then I&#039;m not forced to hang around with the arrogant fuck-wits who constantly spout of about the supposed &quot;benefits&quot; of psychedelic drugs.<br />People who will endlessly tell you how acid has changed them, without ever going into detail. The only apparent change is now they think they are on some &quot;higher level&quot; than everyone around them. When pressed for details you get vague statements such as &quot;I now realize the interconnectedness of everything&quot;.<br />Study some real fucking science and you will understand more about the world than you ever will taking a drug.<br /><br />I spent my teenage years reading about these mystical experiences you get when taking psychedelics - at the first opportunity I tried them all. Extensively. I was expecting something magical, I was not fearing anything. However, I had a shit time, every time. Instead of the mind-expanding properties, my mind goes blank. I cannot think straight, I cannot concentrate on anything. Maybe you acid-heads are confusing being fucking confused with being enlightened? <br />And every time I explain my experiences to an acid-head, it always comes down to them deducing that I must have some kind of moral defect. Only the most perfect human beings can enjoy psychedelics. You see, users of these drugs are simply better than everyone else!<br />These drugs excite the &quot;this is important&quot; region of your brain and nothing more.<br />The only worthwhile psychedelic for me is DMT, simply because it&#039;s so crazy, fun and interesting. Like a rollercoaster or bungee-jumping.<br /><br />On the other hand, first time I took speed/meth it was like a lightbulb being turned on in my head. Suddenly I was at complete ease with my life and with others. Seemingly infinite patience, compassion and clarity of thought. Motivation to do things I needed to do, but not so much that I was restless. My entire life runs smoother. It&#039;s so cruel that the dangers of these drugs force me to take them very sparingly.<br /><br />So fuck you, basically.

Your lucky if this is how speed makes you feel. <br /><br />@everyone I do believe that there will be benefits of most types of&nbsp; drugs, but not all people will get the same benefits from any particular drug. I say it&#039;s ok to question what others get from their drugs, but why insult those that something you don&#039;t from&nbsp; a drug. Sounds like jealousy when you do.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Hmmm that all I want to say.

I just completely don&#039;t get why someone would do that for fun. <br /><br />Most stimulants I get. The question is if you like the dopamine rush that comes with it. Some properties I like: being in a really good mood (up to euphoria, of course mdma is different d&#039;oh), added motivation and duration (boring stuff that needs to be done is fun now), wakes you up (for real, not like coffee), makes you horny, can be used for doping in sports (exchanges the &quot;pain&quot; with fun), and a couple of more I can&#039;t remember now. Also helps against depression and anxiety. <br /><br />So whether you like being on amphetamines or not, you have to admit that taking them can be quite useful at times. The day before the deadline, you still need to finish that paper. Good luck with your weed/lsd/shrooms. <br /><br />This cannot be said about downers, there is probably no legit use besides the illnesses doctors prescribe this stuff for. I recently read an argument on reddit where one guy claimed benzos give you a high and the other dude said they just make you go to sleep. The benzo stoner argued that they make you high because you pass out. For me thats the opposite of being high or a high gone wrong. I never got the fun part of passing out, ever since the binge drinking and binge bong smoking started when I was in my late teens. He who blacks out first wins. Heroin I think I just don&#039;t understand (some casual user wanna explain what it&#039;s all about?) but it&#039;s something that&#039;s just not for me.<br /><br />I concur with your list of good drugs though, lsd, shrooms, 2c*, mdma-class, etc. that enable you to have a unique experience (other than lying around unable to move) that your senses wouldn&#039;t be able to provide without the drug. If I can&#039;t walk around experiencing shit and being completely in awe all the time, the high doesn&#039;t qualify for this group. For me those are sacred. If you take those to get completely wasted, unable to interact with your environment I consider you nothing short of a fuckin moron.

				Everybody is different. Everybody has a different brain chemistry. Everybody has a different outlook on life. People take drugs for various reasons as it&#039;s been already said. Some like that crazy energetic rush that comes with hard stimulants. Other take stimulants to get work done. I&#039;ve heard of students occasionally using cocaine to write 50-page essays and ace them. I personally hate any amphetamine-like stimulants.<br /><br />Other drugs, such as psychedelics can be used to explore the depths of one&#039;s mind. I myself am fascinated with death and a possible afterlife. Despite this, I have never been &quot;enlightened&quot; as many users report&nbsp; to have been. Actually, I have had some of the scariest, most terrifying experiences (yet very mystical) from psychedelics or dissociatives. But they have taught me a lot of things as well. However, I don&#039;t toy with them on a regular basis, because depression and various anxiety disorders run in my family (including myself). <br /><br />Perhaps that is why I enjoy downers, especially opiates more than other classes. People with healthy minds don&#039;t realize that feeling calm, relaxed and happy is something precious for people who are chronically depressed or anxious. I am not saying that drugs are the ultimate cure, but having that extra relief is something great.<br />

				Fair enough, but is it safe to say some people may be confused as to which ones can promote a better life? Example, since many peoples thought processes are different that would mean MANY are &quot;glitched&quot; in some way. So someones version of happiness may be completely different from someone else, now of course this would mean there is a general &quot;Right way&quot; to be happy and a &quot;Not so right way&quot; to be happy, meaning the most effective way. <br /><br />So many people believe doing &quot;insert random thing to do here&quot; while on meth makes them happy, but does it REALLY make them happy when they cannot perceive with their own mind what happiness REALLY is. Thus they get confused about what drugs promote their happiness and which ones do not. Which is why they choose this drug of choice over another one, because their perception on happiness is &quot;glitched&quot; due to the environment they were raised in, how they define their words which may be different from others, which created a completely different reality, to not understanding human emotion it&#039;s purity due to television and other media and other people poisoning your perception on emotion. <br /><br />An example for this would be an watching television or movies and watching actors act out emotions, well because your brain picks up random pieces of information from watching television or movies, one will use MANY of their emotions based on what they saw on television, they will react to things like somebody on television without even understanding why they over reacted to it. Which causes them to not even understand their own reality, because they do not understand themselves, a.k.a. their emotion.<br /><br />;)

				I agree with pretty much everything you said. We live in a society full of shit. Most of the world&#039;s population are just sheep who are brainwashed by the entertainment industry. I see myself as an intelligent, young, far-outer. I see my peers try to get through the weekdays like zombies and then get wasted on the weekend. Just fun, fun, fun. My blood boils whenever I hear the popular contemporary motto: &quot;We are young, we are just having fun and we don&#039;t care.&quot; Yet I am the bad, stupid, irresponsible one when I occasionally take psychoactives. Well, fuck you society. There is no way I am going to live like them. Without any deeper outlook on life or their future. Most of them oriented only on the material aspects of their life. And knowledge? I don&#039;t see any. The most basic, crucial knowledge is missing in their brains. Fortunately I have a few friends who are capable of having meaningful conversations with me. The others just talk about celebrities, sex, alcohol. They have no idea that the world economy is collapsing, that there are continuous wars around the world etc. Damn, what kind of a society is this. <br /><br />Enough rant about the society :D. Drugs partially are a tool for me to escape this world. Reasons above.<br /><br />Back to the topic :D As far as happiness goes, as you already have said, we are basically being taught what feeling happy, sad etc. is like. As far as drugs go, the happiness they bring is monotonous and fake. There can be exceptions IMO (psychedelics). The &quot;ultimate&quot;, yet fake happiness from whatever activity it is they are doing while on meth is just plain chemistry. Say I take meth, my brain is having a party and every neuron is vomiting dopamine. HELL YEA, LET&#039;S PICK EVERY DUST PARTICLE FROM THE AIR, THAT WILL BE FUN...something like this..happiness? No way.

				Ugh, that&#039;s why I look down upon drugs such as alcohol...or any drug that makes you &quot;NUMB &amp; DUMB...er&quot;. I feel as if stimulants keep your mind leveled and focused on things that do not matter, where as lsd and shrooms and even mdma to an extent can help you understand your emotions and overall reality more which can help you with the life experience =)

				the problem with meth for me is that is goes past being a drug into a life style. Rolling the pipe back and forth for days on end till muscle between your thumb and index finger get sore, lol then you start thinking sleep is a waste of time and you can accomplish so many cool projects while spun, lol then really stupid shit starts to become a great idea. thinking i can go to work with no sleep for a week and try to maintain, its tough. Meth can be awesome fun, but the hang over is like the worst. Then when you start jonesing for it.lol Or i could just eat some acid on my day off from work, have a beautiful experience. Perhaps i might reflect on my life, could think about a certain thing over and over, like on this one trip i had, i kept thinking to my self i need to get a job because i couldn&#039;t afford to go see this friend i wanted to party with. LOL a week later i had job. Or perhaps on another trip, might start to think about what motivates your dad to wear baseball caps. I say to each their own, but for me personally i prefer the acid trip to the meth trip.

				I did meth one time. with a friend who was a reg user... apparently it wasn&#039;t so great of shit either... smoked a bit... got that brain hit. was like &quot;ohhhh&quot; that&#039;s why people take this shit... I&#039;d grown up with stoners and tripping on many hits of acid and always had the frown towards meth and certainly got ripped off by meth bitches. <br /><br />The truth here IMO is that the cycles of use always change the experience. OP talks much about psyche&#039;s but to be honest... I can&#039;t do em much anymore. My head is fucking OPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!! Acid, shrooms, MDMA, MDA, COke........ have all been cycled by myself until they become very different than they were initially. LSD is probably my most influential substance besides educational and spiritual material I&#039;ve come across and experienced. But the intimacy and insight gained through mol and evven blow with friends, lovers and self... has been substantial. monumental. <br /><br />Just my 2 cents. I noticed in earlier years the dumbest dicks (perhaps maybe those who&#039;d had the more challenges in life than me??) we&#039;re always the meth heads... maybe just after doing plenty meth.... And they would eat tabs or pills or whatever the fuck just to be high. I&#039;ve acted in similar ways during times of lowwwwness. <br /><br />Are there any somewhat habitual meth users that still have their brain functioning and also started out as psychedelic/lsd users n all? <br /><br />It actually took me a long time before I tried coke, and mdma was later than acid shrooms n weed. and for OP alcohol is a brilliant fucking substance. it&#039;s a CARRIER of medicine besides a carrier of calories. Toxic sure... but has many benifits in the world. Weed is also extremely medicinal in many ways. It&#039;s like fuckin&#039; ancient man! And I&#039;ve never thought of as being enlightened for using acid. I&#039;ve always known that definitely without a doubt.... EVERYONE should NOTTTTT just fuckin use acid. We all are conditioned, indoctrinated and a product of our circumstances, environment, experiences yadda yadda..... Each aspect contributes to what we use and what we seek out. <br /><br />Over all mdma with a lover has been by far my favorite experience ever.

By a real happiness I meant something that comes naturally and lasts a long time, perhaps even a lifetime. I know it is all chemistry, but you can&#039;t achieve consistent happiness with drugs. Take heroin for the instance. It makes you super-happy, but when you get addicted, the party is over.<br />But I agree that drugs are a short-term solution for somebody with mental problems etc. as you stated, but for a long-term resolution, feeding your brain with chemicals won&#039;t help anymore.

Which is why I &quot;look down&quot; on it, because it does not promote enhancing your brains intellect.

Maybe you should slow down on the alcohol / other depressants sir ;). <br /><br />P.S. <br /><br />You want a butt plug so you don&#039;t get so butt hurt next time I insert my dildo into you? ^_^<br /><br />

				All I have learned from this thread:<br />Most people think what they do is the best.<br />Understand that everyone only does what they do because it is the most logical and pleasurable option for them. People do not think &quot;I will do meth even though I know other drugs are better&quot; like the OP seems to think. If someone chooses to live in a large scale replica of a huge asshole with ants all over it I dont give a fuck and all the power to them. However, no power to you for smashing other people. Your post resonates bad vibes, brother. We are all one, you must have not tripped today because your morality is way off base.

				I tried to read through all of the thread, but I didn&#039;t make it.

I have come to a self realization that my priorities change at a whim and without pretense so I accept it as they come.<br /><br />Pyschs -If you are complacent (accepted) where you are at, but seeking something more to explain why, what and how (Way of the Shaman) -- Psychedelics are, in my opinion, an outlet to transcend outside the conglomerate mass knowledge and hopefully Da Vinci some shit where you get that whole spine tingly feeling (&lt;3)<br /><br />Stims - If you&#039;ve got a bunch of shit you have to do, but (like myself) are always too fucking lazy to take action -- Stimulants can give you that self fulfillment of perpetuating those actions very efficiently and almost derive pleasure just from doing so, even if they are monotonous (&lt;3)<br /><br />Opis - If you&#039;ve got a day to kill and don&#039;t give a fuck, what is more cost effective than munching/snorting your body full of opiates and eating ice cream stuffed in a waffle cones (&lt;3) (I&#039;ve got personal vendettas on this type, but I don&#039;t disregard the attraction)<br /><br />If anything, it&#039;s not that &quot;people&quot; are more prone or drawn to the usage of &quot;expansions&quot;, but that their situations might dictate their current preference.<br /><br />Except for Bros.

				I&#039;m going to attempt to give a libertarian perspective on this topic and since i&#039;m such a terrible writer and and even worse thinker I hope you can all bare with me.&nbsp; I see drugs as a set of choices for free and independent people with various life experiences and pharmacology to experiment with and find out which ones they A. can use responsibly and not turn into an alcoholic or drug addict and B. which ones take them where they want to go for a sort of &quot;vacation&quot; for a short while as long as that vacation once again doesn&#039;t turn into a full time job where they neglect their responsibilities to themselves and others. Just like we have various choices in music, art, and people we grow to love, drugs offer free people choices on how to live their lives to the best of their various ability.&nbsp; So I may hate what cocaine does too me (which I do) I don&#039;t feel the need for other people to like or dislike my personal recreational drug use because at the end of the day I have to live with that makes me happy and content and which substances allow me to enjoy those happy moments with friends and loved ones. So when it comes to drugs I&#039;m a&nbsp; pretty live and let live guy, unless your actions result in the harm or neglect of a child or other innocent.&nbsp; If what your doing isn&#039;t causing harm to other people I say fuck it do all you want. Sorry for the novel I thought the person who started the thread brought up a great topic for reasonable debate and discussion and if some of my comments in any way offended anyone please forgive me that was not my intent. (also please forgive the tree 1mg Xanax pills that seemed to have taken affect about halfway through this post.&nbsp; All the best and stay safe and have a wonderful july.<br /><br />Organon

				Hahaha yep if your drug of choice is LSD I reckon you&#039;re immune to all other drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked crack, injected heroin, smoked meth for days at a time.<br /><br />In comparison to LSD they&#039;re all completely empty and meaningless.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had peaks on LSD + nitrous combined that are like Mt Everest compared to the shitty mole hill sized rush of smoking crack. The IV rush of heroin is a fucking joke compared to peaking on great acid with great friends and great music.<br /><br />If you think you&#039;ve experienced euphoria take a couple of tabs of acid and keep inhaling nitrous... GOD LIKE.<br /><br />And yet because that combo is so hard to get addicted to, you end up realising that getting addicted to hard drugs is just going to get in the way of you having awesome LSD experiences.

				Probably been answered already but drugs affect everyone differently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been an athlete all my life yet I&#039;m one of those people who are tired all the time. If I sit down during the day, I can nap. It&#039;s the most awful feeling in the world. I&#039;ve talked to 3-4 different doctors and a shrink who think it is laziness. It is not. It&#039;s chronic fatigue or something similar. <br /><br />In either case, being tired all the time also makes you in a down mood a lot. Tried the SSRI route, helped a little, but nothing compares to capsuling some good crystal or amphetamine myself and using it in the same manner as adderall. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like tweaking out or being up for days, but when I have to study upper level chemistry for school then nothing helps my motivation more than a half or a full point capsuled up and taken in the morning.<br /><br />Just my perspective.

				After capping 60mg or so of crystal I can tell you it is the best drug ever tried. The dopamine/pleasure hit was better then sex X1000. Had it in the morning was feeling good all day then redosed and got a peak later in the night that lasted about 30 minutes of pure heaven. Was taken orally. No comedown , Could sleep fine. Any drug that keeps dopamine in the brain longer and produces more like meth will always be so addictive.<br /><br />Runs rings around cocaine all day long.
