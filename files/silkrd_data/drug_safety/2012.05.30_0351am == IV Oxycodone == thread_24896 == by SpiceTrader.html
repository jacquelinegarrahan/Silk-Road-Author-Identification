				First of all, don&#039;t crush and IV pills, it&#039;s bad for you. Secondly, oxycodone doesn&#039;t give the same rush that you get from IVing other opiates. It still feels nice, but you&#039;re not going to get a huge rush. Oxycodone has a bioavailability of about 86%, which is much higher than most other opiates. So eating the pill will make you feel nearly as good (but not quite) as injecting it.<br /><br />In my opinion, 40mg IV is way too much for a first time, unless you&#039;re experienced with heroin (IV). I&#039;d start off with 10-15mg. Remember, you can always do more after a few minutes, but you can NEVER take back what you&#039;ve done. Trying for a huge rush/high the first time just isn&#039;t worth the risk. Start off small, see how it feels, and then work up from there. Especially since you have two pills, I&#039;d really encourage you to start off with 10mg.<br /><br />With that said, make sure the OC&#039;s are the old formula that can be crushed for instant release. (From what I understand, anyway) the new formula shouldn&#039;t be IV&#039;d at all.<br /><br />Step 1.)<br />Get some sterile, distilled water. Don&#039;t just use water out of your tap. Roughly crush up the pill on something clean like aluminum foil. You don&#039;t need to get it super fine.<br /><br />Step 2.)<br />Put the crushed pill in about 2ml of the sterile water, and let it set for about an hour. Shake it up (I find using a syringe is handy, if you have some larger ones) so that it mixes up nicely.<br /><br />Step 3.)<br />Run the solution through a .2 micron filter. Then run it through a new, clean .2 micron filter again.<br /><br />Step 4.)<br />You should now have a clear, or slightly blue tinted clear solution that you can inject.<br /><br />Please be careful. I don&#039;t know how easy wheel filters are to get in Australia, but here in the US I just order them off Amazon, and they&#039;re at my door in a couple days. Just using cotton is better than nothing, but IT ISN&#039;T SAFE. I don&#039;t crush pills anymore, but I do use heroin IV, and I like to filter that as well, so that&#039;s why I keep them on hand. As far as I know, this is about the safest way to inject a pill, if you&#039;re set on doing it. Feel free to add to/correct anything I&#039;ve said.<br /><br />

				didnt notice if it was mentioned, but make sure you remove the colored outer coating. wet slightly with some saliva then wipe away on a cloth, which it will stain <br /><br />i use just the right amount to get it tacky then let it dry mostly, and if i do it just right each entire face will peel off together ensuring i never wiped away any of the inner layer. if its too dry it wont scrap off easily though<br /><br />Id be careful and start small, cause even insufflated which has lower bioavailability than oral I initially got sick off just 10-15 so shooting you may want to test the waters with 5 mg or less and work up to be safe
