				Anyone ever tried this combo? Is it safe? I&#039;ve done heroin but not ecstasy...would you start by doing the heroin, then the E or the E and heroin after the comedown?

				i imagine that adding smack to a dirty comedown would be awful, but then ive never taken heroin so i dont know.<br /><br />frankly im amazed there exists a person who went straight to heroin, bypassing e, the cheaper and more socially acceptable of the 2

				who gives a fuck what society approves of?? I dont approve of murder, so I dont murder. I think it is wrong because i respect human life not because society says I shouldnt. I disapprove of mdma use so I dont use it but... hold on a minute :) just did a small line of H <br /><br />Sorry not trying to give you a hard time, just being silly... as you are, since honestly something like &quot;socially acceptable&quot; is trivial :P<br /><br /><br />I really dont know if this combination is safe but it sure does sound crazy as fuck! That would be one intense rush of euphoria.<br /><br />If one was going to get the most out of the combination, he would theoretically ingest the molly and wait at least an hour so the mdma is in full swing. then the H would be ingested so you get the maximum effect from both drugs simultaneously <br /><br />Using one to mask the comedown from the other isnt really using them in a true combo imo<br /><br />- miRNA

I started on booze, moved onto weed, then mushies, e, etc. and followed what you may view as a typical &quot;graduation.&quot; I have a friend who smoked weed a bit, then moved straight onto heroin. Another friend who took a couple Adderall, tried some meth, went back to Adderall, and now that&#039;s the only substance she uses. Hasn&#039;t and won&#039;t even touch booze or weed.<br /><br />People use substances for different reasons, and may move onto other substances for similar or different reasons.

				What ROAs would you use for both? That would have a large effect. Personally, if I were to embark on such an adventure, I would probably snort both.

				i did heroin before i ever did ecstasy as well, i don&#039;t think this is such a rare occurrence. i wasn&#039;t IVing when I did this combo together i was still snorting heroin. i snorted about .2 of good quality heroin during the comedown off the MDMA, it just put me into an ultimate relaxation mode i passed out shortly after i took the dope where in most cases when I take MDMA i wont sleep at all.

				Mixing uppers and downers can be a dirty business. Drinking after MDMA wears off is pretty nice...maybe heroin would have the same effect? I dont know never tried H, but most things dont mix well with E in my experiences.

				One time ate a strong roll and had fun with friends then hours later when home alone took an average-sized shot and it was amazing- just a bit of a heavy deep warmth to perfectly complement a cool uplifting mildly euphoric afterglow.&nbsp; One of the &quot;best&quot; chemical cocktails I&#039;ve stumbled into.<br />On the other hand, another time when already strung out and pretty opiated if not high per se since i had a habit, ate a pill and was not able to fully enjoy it as it was overwhelmed by the downward pull of the dope which i now couldn&#039;t fully enjoy either as it was being interfered with.&nbsp; A lame wasteful unremarkable experience.<br />So it seems to work better if you do the E alone (with buds of course) then when start coming down add H, but if addicted just throwing on a roll seems shitty and pointless.
