				I&#039;m wondering if there is a good drug to take in order to come down from a trip with a psychedelic that hits too hard on the 5-HT2x receptors. I have cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) which is a serotonin antagonist. Would this be a good candidate to counteract a trip that&#039;s gone too strong or one you just want to come down from?

				Thanks for the reply. It sure would be nice to have an &quot;emergency&quot; come-downer should things get out of hand but I wouldn&#039;t dream of having IV Lorazepam on standby. Not sure that I could get my hands on some anyway.<br /><br />What I do have is Flexeril. If it doesn&#039;t work to kill a 2Cx buzz will it at least in your opinion work to ease up on the muscle tension. It&#039;s a muscle relaxant after all but not sure how it would react with brain chemistry.<br /><br />Thanks again

				Mirtazapine would be the best bet, it works the opposite way to psychedelics on 5-HT receptors. Taking mirtazapine will end your trip completely.

				It is a myth that Benzo&#039;s stop trips. They don&#039;t stop the trip, they just reduce anxiety a little. The effect is probably more placebo than anything else. We are highly open to positive suggestion in the right way when on psychedelics. <br /><br />If you feel like it is going bad. Change the set and setting, happy/relaxing meditative music (without words), lights on, fresh air in the house, citrus smells etc. These all make us feel happy. Watch cute animal videos, puppies and loving dogs showing affection etc.<br /><br />Also force a smile on your face and keep it there. Your physical actions also change our moods, forcing a smile and keeping it there naturally will make you happy. The enforce this with other setting change.<br /><br />FH

				I&#039;ve had fantastic experiences &quot;stopping&quot; my trips with etizolam. It hits me faster than any benzo I&#039;ve ever tried and is always great at killing the anxiety on the spot. However, keep in mind that you&#039;ll still be tripping as mentioned earlier ITT, it just makes you calm enough to avoid the negative thought loops that lead to bad trips

I&#039;ve ended several bad trips simply by forcing myself to smile.&nbsp; Or by trying to find something humourous in my thoughts/surroundings. The purpose of laughter is to relieve anxiety. If you can find something funny, all that anxiety is going to be converted into laughter. The more anxious you were, the more uncontrollable the laughter.<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s just the KNOWLEDGE that I have benzos available that prevents me from having bad trips. I have never had to take them.<br /><br />I have combined valium with LSD, I found it very pleasant. Good for taking acid at a party or something. It doesn&#039;t eliminate the effects of LSD.

				5-HT2x &lt;- the x means a variable like 5-HT2a, 5-HT2c, etc.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t considering to take it on the comedown but rather in case I felt too wound up (a precursor sign to serotonin syndrome) to BRING the trip down. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially fatal condition caused by serotonin agonists and where the body&#039;s muscles are shivering so much that your temperature can reach unsafe levels and you can go into cardiac arrest. Cyclobenzaprine is a serotonin ANTagonist so I thought that maybe it could be used to reverse the symptoms.

				Serotonin Syndrome doesn&#039;t occur overnight or with a trip.Mostly it happens with MDMA abuse. <br />

				Also, taking benzo&#039;s when its already too late will probably not do you that much good.<br /><br />They may abort the trip in your mind, but they will not magically flush serotonin buildup in the body at all. <br /><br />Effectively this means that you could cancel the trip, but still be at the same risk of developing serotonin syndrome regardless .

				If flexeril does anything it may ease muscle tension and side effects of vasoconstriction. Maybe.
