			<dd class="postbody">
				[Apologies if this thread is not in the correct place.]<br /><br />Hello, I am interested in using some sort of drug for study-enhancement which will allow me to concentrate on my work for hours. If anyone could help me know the best dosage for me for each of these that’d help too. (I’m about 154lbs and 6ft-ish, I’d like to be studying for as long as possible.) Price is a very big consideration for me, so the cheaper the better. Also, I’m based in the UK, so if anyone knows of any way I can acquire any of these drugs outside of SR for cheaper that’d also be helpful. Here are the three options I currently have, if anyone has any other suggestions that’d be brilliant.<br /><br />Adderall – On SR I can get 15 20mg pills for about £107 and 30 for about £168. As far as I’m aware there isn’t a brand name available even with a prescription in the UK. Would I normally be able to buy this for cheaper on SR?<br /><br />Ritalin – Available on SR.<br /><br />Modafinil – Available in the UK for around £2 per 100mg pill. I don’t know how I’d be able to buy this though as I think I need to prove I have a prescription even online. And I don’t know if this would have the desired effect.<br /><br />The initial questions broken down:<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the cheapest option per dose?<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would last the longest?<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would allow me the best concentration and willingness to study?<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best way to dose? (Would I take a pill while revising then a pill in the exam or just take pills for revision?)

				This thread discusses them all. In my experience, they work better as &#039;work drugs&#039; rather than study drugs. No heightened thought processes, you just don&#039;t get essay fatigue so easily and have improved focus.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7034.0

				If you are interested in a more nootropic approach...deprenyl worked quite well for me.&nbsp; It&#039;s also healthy and cheap.&nbsp; You won&#039;t get &quot;high&quot; from it and you likely won&#039;t notice anything the first couple times, but it does work.&nbsp; Don&#039;t expect a huge change - you still have to try and study, it just makes it easier.

				ADD drugs like Adderall and Ritalin are not for everybody.&nbsp; For me, they are strictly a party drug that facilitates social lubrication, and they are absolutely horrible at helping me study.<br /><br />Nootropics would be the better way to go, and would probably end up running you cheaper than pharms, and would be easier to get as they are not illegal.&nbsp; The downside is that they take a while to build up in your system and you may have to take some of them everyday.<br /><br />Different things work for different people though, so experimenting and doing your own research would be the way to go.

				Thanks for the help everyone. Based on the replies in this thread and further research I have since done I have decided to go for either Ritalin or Adderall and buy from Silk Road. I&#039;m still unsure about the dosage though, in my research I&#039;ve read people saying that as low as 5mg of Adderall is all they need for a good study session - however I&#039;ve also read people saying that 20mg would be a better bet.<br /><br />For both Ritalin and Adderall what would people suggest as a good dosage to study with? (If I get high I&#039;m not bothered but I&#039;m not really interested in amphetamines for recreational use so if I could still have the same motivation to study at a lower dosage and not get high I don&#039;t mind. I&#039;m about 154 pounds if that helps.)<br /><br />Also, while on Ritalin and/or Adderall, will it be easy for people to notice that I&#039;m using some sort of drug? I understand that an increase in energy might be a hint but apart from that does it have any physical side-effects?<br /><br />Thanks again for your help everyone.

				If you want to write extremely good papers or understand things well, take 3/4 a tab of LSD.<br /><br />Tryptamine sells self-made nootropic formulations in pills. He sells sample packs for $5.<br /><br />Adderall 10 mg I would recommend for study/reading/homework. Be careful though, you won&#039;t have an appetite, and all amphetamines are a little bit bad for you, Ritilin I believe being worse off.
