				Title: <strong>Cannabis detox</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I need to detox from cannabis and was wondering if anyone knows of any products that actually work over in the United Kingdom?<br /><br />In the past, I used a product from the Boots outlets called the &quot;Boots 5 day detox box&quot; and this actually worked. Unfortunately, this product was discontinued last year. Why this happened is a mystery as the other &quot;herbal&quot; detoxes just does not work, at all.<br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-92978/Boots-detox-5-Day-Plan-Total-Body-Cleanse.html<br /><br />I am a heavy smoker, averaging around 5-6 joints a day and would like a solution that will rid my body of all cannabinoids in less than a weeks time.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				Thank you all for the suggestions. <br /><br />I need to detox as I plan to partake in a medical trial. I don&#039;t think drinking shitloads of water and eating fruit&amp;veg will do the job, perhaps aide in the detox but not do the job completely.<br /><br />The Boots detox box really worked, I&#039;ve used it a dozen times or so and was never left red faced at the clinic unlike the few times I tried and failed miserably with alternative BS products.<br /><br />Screening takes place in two weeks, I&#039;ll give your suggestions a go!<br /><br />Any suggestions are still welcome :)

Vitamin B helps reduce suspicion of funny business. <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to exercise (THC is stored in adipose tissue), make sure it&#039;s intense enough that you&#039;ve cleared your body to below detectable levels early enough that you can abstain from exercise for the few days-week before the test itself. If you exercise up to the day of the test, you may risk excreting any remaining THC in your urine. I have not been scientific about confirming this, but it was effective enough for my own urine test that I would not risk doing otherwise.&nbsp;
