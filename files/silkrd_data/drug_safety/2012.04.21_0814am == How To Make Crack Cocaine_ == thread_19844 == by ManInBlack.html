				Okay, I&#039;ve seen the 2 sets of step by step picture instructions located on the normal web, with some text below the pictures. That&#039;s not precise enough! I&#039;ve tried before and it doesn&#039;t seem to work out well. Although I&#039;ve only ever tried the spoon method. If I were to buy 3.5 grams of good cocaine here on SR. What would be the best way to go about turning it into crack cocaine? Is there a certain amount of soda to add? or certain amount of water to add? What about how hot I should get it? I&#039;ve read and heard that double boil is best, is it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I Just don&#039;t want to waste a few hundred dollars worth of product when it can be done right. Any replies would be helpful!<br /><br />-MIB

				I am by no means an expert, but can provide good information, but I am sure someone will lay out a freebase tutorial which stomps all over &quot;crack&quot; as far as quality goes.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t use a spoon. Get a glass or pyrex measuring cup (the ones that are like 4-6 inches high) Have a pot of boiling water on the stove, but not super boiling just a nice gentle boil.<br /><br />For every one gram of coke add .2 to .25 grams of backing soda and put that in your pyrex. Don&#039;t add water yet. Put the pyrex or regular glass in the boiling water (not too much water in there just enough to go up an inch or two on the sides of your pyrex or glass. Start mixing up your soda and coke dry for a few minutes until it gets a little crunchy feeling and you get a hint of coke smell now start adding water very slowly and stirring it in the mixture of coke and baking soda in the pyrex. Add very little in increment while mixing the all three together until you get a consistance of&nbsp; batter and then let that cook a little while you stir it slowly periodically for 2-3 minutes and then continue to add water&nbsp; until incrementally and you will start seeing an oil base floating now this is where you stop take your pyrex out and turn on your water faucet on cold just enough where it is dripping cold water drop by drop and put the pyrex with the oil base floating on water under the cold drip. You will see the oil start to harden and gain a thicker and thicker consistency. I just let it drip and do whatever and come back, because the crack will sink and you can leave it dripping in the pyrex until it overflows, but the crack will always stay at the bottom.<br /><br />Drain the water and snag your crack at the bottom let dry, or smoke whatever doesn&#039;t matter much beside it melts way better if you let those pieces dry, but I know you will be in a hurry.

				I&#039;ve never done anything larger than 1G myself.&nbsp; I was showed the spoon cooking procedure w/Soda when I first started, and that worked well, but I never saw a &#039;nugget/rock&#039; until someone showed me their way of doing things.<br /><br />Mr X. took a pyrex test tube (Approximately 1/2&quot; Inside diameter X 6&quot; long) and dropped the street bought cocaine into the tube along with a pinch (I have no idea how much to be exact) of baking soda and water.&nbsp; Mr. X then swirled the test tube mixture over a propane flame (Think Bernz-O-Matic contractor) still the solution cooked, and got to a slight boiling temperature for just 20 seconds at the most,&nbsp; He then took the tube, and dropped into a cup of ice water.&nbsp; Just a few seconds after that, a giant solid rock of base formed in the center of the tube.&nbsp; Mr X.&nbsp; ten poured it over a coffee filter and only waited a minute or two at most to try his the goods.<br /><br />(If you try this, you HAVE TO COOK the test tube with a baking soda/water solution prior to using cocaine, as it will stick to the side of the tube, and not go into one large boulder).&nbsp; Dump that, and then start from scratch).<br /><br />It was some of the best I ever did!&nbsp; What I noticed was that as soon as the cold water was introduced into the process a SOLID boulder was formed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also saw someone do the ammonia method, and it formed an immediate rock, but I never tried it myself.<br /><br />As far as powder is concerned I will NEVER do coke again without &#039;washing&#039; it first.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing what it looks like once you remove the impurities.

				Thank you both for your prompt replies! I didn&#039;t even know if I posted this in the right section? Anyway, I have a few weeks before I will even attempt this process. The instructions you guys left will definitely get used. I&#039;ll have this thread open sitting right next to the sink when I&#039;m doing it! Thanks again for your replies! Any other information is greatly appreciated!<br /><br />@dkmonk --&gt; What do you mean by &quot;I am sure someone will lay out a freebase tutorial which stomps all over &quot;crack&quot; as far as quality goes&quot;? Is there a more efficient way for me to go about turning cocaine into a smokable form?<br /><br />-MIB

				Forget the baking soda method... <br /><br />The best way to do an Acid/Base extraction is via ammonium hydroxide solution (aka Ammonia)<br /><br />You need to use 10% ammonia without detergents (i.e. not cloudy ammonia)<br /><br />Follow this procedure here:<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/335233-Making-freebase-cocaine......the-correct-procedure!<br /><br />DO NOT OPEN THIS LINK IN YOUR TOR BROWSER (copy into a note and open it when not connected to tor). This is good procedure for any non tor page. <br /><br />Baking soda/Sodium bicarbonate method works ok, but it&#039;s hard to get the right ratio of baking soda to cocaine... Most of the time you end up with too much baking soda which contaminates the final product. That being said, you can wash the resulting product with water as cocaine freebase is not soluble in water but baking soda is.<br />Always ensure the freebase is thoroughly dried before you use it. <br /><br /><br />

				WOW! What a post! I definitely have not stumbled across that page while looking for this procedure. Thanks for the extremely helpful post. I think that a few people here on SR will try that method at least once. It only requires a gram, so why not? Never heard of a cold method, I always thought it had to be warm to begin the process.

No jam jars! Use a proper graduated pipette to measure out the product.<br /><br />
