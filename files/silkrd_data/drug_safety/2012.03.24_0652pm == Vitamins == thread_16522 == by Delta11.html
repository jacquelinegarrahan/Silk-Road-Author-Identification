				Post what vitamins you take here!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking this vitamin combo for the past year and it really has changed my life for the better so I wanted to share it with all of you. Some tips that I&#039;ve learned along the way:<br />-Make sure you take all of them right after a meal to avoid some serious nausea.<br />-Make sure to take them with real fruit juice to help absorption<br />-Try to take them everyday!<br /><br />http://pastebin.com/w90WUFUq

				I take b-complex and vitamin d every morning. <br /><br />Everything else I get from my normal diet. <br /><br />Also, I will use creatine for a few months at a time when I want a little help with my lifting.

				I have a tough time swallowing some bigger pills, so I go with chewable vitamins.&nbsp; Trader Joe&#039;s has a pretty good chewable adult multi-vitamin that I take.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I take 1500MG of Calcium Citrate per day, without fail.&nbsp; I prefer the chewable wafers that TwinLab makes-- they also include Magnesium and Vitamin D3 which your body needs to absorb the calcium.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your body can&#039;t absorb much more than 500-750MG of calcium at once, so it&#039;s best to take calcium in divided doses (half in the morning, half in the afternoon/evening).&nbsp; <br /><br />(Ladies, do not slack on your calcium. Start as early in your life as you can. Seriously. Do not fuck around.&nbsp; Osteoporosis sucks HARD.)<br /><br />When taking calcium, make sure it&#039;s Calcium Citrate. Most calcium supplements are the much cheaper calcium carbonate... your body barely absorbs calcium carbonate, so you&#039;re probably taking a ton of it thinking it&#039;s doing you some good, and it&#039;s not.&nbsp; Read the label, yo.&nbsp; (Be aware: There&#039;s a brand of calcium called &quot;Citrical&quot; which people just assume is Calcium Citrate because it just kinda sounds like it. It&#039;s not. Read the label.)<br /><br />(Sorry, just got a little soapboxxy there! :)&nbsp; )

				Here&#039;s my vitamin regimen before taking MDMA:<br /><br />About 3-4 days before I&#039;m planning to roll, I&#039;ll take 100MG of 5-HTPs each day, in two divided doses. (One 50MG capsule in the morning, another in the evening; usually with food.)<br /><br />About 2 hours into the roll and again the next morning, I take 400 IU of Vitamin E, 10,000 IU of Vitamin A, and 2 grams of Vitamin C.&nbsp; (Take the Vitamin C with a little food; it can give you a little heartburn if you take it on an empty stomach.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Anti-oxidants are important during and after an MDMA session, even a light one.<br /><br />

				A multivitamin every day, and make sure I spend some time in the sun.<br /><br />Vitamin C is a big deal to me, as a cigarette smoker, I&#039;ve put a lot of bad things in my body.&nbsp; Vitamin C breaks down some of the nasty stuff in cigarettes, so I would imagine it would do the same on other things.<br />Remember that vitamin C will inhibit some protein absorption, but is more readily absorbed when combined with Iron.

				I take the following every morning when i wake up:Multi day vitamin, coq-10,ginko bilobia, milk thistle, L-tryosine, Vitamin b6, and vitamin b12. (There is vitamin b 6 and b 12 in my multi day but, i found that taking a little bit more in the morning makes me less drowsy.) I always have to take them before eating otherwise i get sick.

				Just have a good diet. You don&#039;t want to overdo these vitamins as every intake of one effects your bodies processing of another, especially calcium I would avoid that completely.

				Your body stores vitamins in your body, if it didn&#039;t, we&#039;d all pass out this instant. Use your money on vitamin D, magnesium (not the cheap oxid kind), vitamin C and take a multivit every other day. This is plenty for people who keep a healthy diet with various veggies
