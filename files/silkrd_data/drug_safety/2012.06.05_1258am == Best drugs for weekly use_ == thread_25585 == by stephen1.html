				For the past 5-6 weeks i&#039;ve been taking ecstasy every weekend, the first 5 times were all well and good, no massive tolerance increases and no comedowns. Then last week I had a pill of which I only felt the effects for about 2 hours which was disappointing, a total waste. I also did mephedrone twice during this period. My question is that i&#039;ve been feeling pretty shitty lately and drugs seem to be the only thing that provides an escape but seeing as people recommend you do ecstasy maybe once a month max, what other drugs could i use on a weekly basis without massive tolerance issues? Mephedrone maybe, or try Ketamine?

				first off, its not really just a recommendation to space out molly, it should be heavily implied rule. respect it and have it be part of a bigger picture.<br />secondly, im sorry to hear that you are trying to escape your reality more so than others i guess. I would recommend trying to just clear up your head space bro, hobby picking, working out...yeah,&nbsp; gay pep talk but it still ties in with actually enjoying drugs man. Rather then being a slave to them. I dont want to sound like a sap man but listen to yourself. Dont get me wrong, I literally just tried meth for the first time last week for the fuck of it, the sheer experience of knowing that i did it. hilariously terrible drug!&nbsp; best way to put it, dont do it. but again, im kinda not in the frame of mind you are. anyways ill stop this fucking shit talking. <br /><br />enjoy in moderation everything man. educate yourself. discipline yourself. Know how the body and specifically your body adjusts/reacts/metabolizes the drug. your looking for a drug to space out weekly? that could involve alot of drugs, but not in the molly category or really the amphetamine. avg spacing for me.... is<br />Everyday mostly likely- Jerk off (regardless of sex)<br />2-3 times a week- Weed, Alcohol <br />1-2 times a week - benzo, <br /><br />1 to 3 times a Month- Coke, <br />Once a Month- Molly, Strong Pain Killer dab<br />Once every 6 Months to Year- LSD, DMT, Mushrooms <br />Year to ??? - some random drug to just try and see how it is (like meth..which sucked....next is ketamine, which i doubt i wont like...then GHB..which i believe will move up on the ranks.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now all this shit is usually done with a friend or event, but not the drug testing..like i did with meth. (did i mention meth is a insanely crazy drug? ok. just making sure) obviously a benzo is a escape pod for other drugs/going to sleep/high anxiety situation<br /><br />but if your feeling pretty shitty, take a hard reset, even out in a sober way and get back to it. <br /><br />happy trails<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I like to break down cannabis into its various forms. Good imported foreign grown weed is usually&nbsp; daytime smoke. Hard to get pure but nice to have about.<br /><br />Some Afghan gold seal is always a great daytime smoke to have. Any good pure medium strength hash is good for work for many occupations.<br /><br />Bud, take the choice, Sativa maybe be for early evening but Indica or some strong hah late at night maybe.<br /><br />Strong hash and oil weekend only.<br /><br />Eating hash, oil weekend.<br /><br />MDMA I would that is every 6 weeks if you&#039;re really enjoying it.Even then at levels of 100mg. If you need 300mg of Ivories MDMA to roll i would stop using for a year!<br /><br />Coke, Funny one. I&#039;d say a few times a year. Special occasions. Bit good coke off here 100mg does me for a night out! At around Â£7 for a really nice coke (wash it of course) you can get by. But do not use all the time and drink some beers.<br /><br />Bezzos,lol&nbsp; some here you could chew in the car on he way to work! They best ought to be used only in conjunction with stimulants IF you are too wired and need a few hours sleep. <br /><br />Heroin, best skip that out always. <br /><br />Crack, not a good drug o get a taste for.<br /><br />Pain killers, use when in pain! Physical pain. Pure opiates are kind, Ones mixed with apap or paracetamol need to be &#039;washed;.<br /><br />Speed, once a moth, or every hour if its from some vendors here!<br /><br />Mushrooms, when in season, naturally.<br /><br />LSD once or twice a year.<br /><br />RCs, up to the individual. Some like some RCs. Some abuse drugs not yet tested on enough people to say it s safe. But many are based on a chenical stricture alightly altered. No guarentee of sfety but no guarentee the stuff do hand out is safe!<br /><br />Caffeine and nicotine daily staples of the way things are.Smoking sucks but with beer? It unifies. <br /><br />The bezos here, I ate 40 gram at 6.00am and ts not 8.00am and I guess I need a new vendor! 2mg Roche worked. Used weekly. 6 mg was too powerful. Vendor gets real prescription not the junk that can pass for&nbsp; genuine drug.<br /><br />But 40mg of &#039;blues&#039; a coffee will wipe them out.<br /><br />Oh, I like dry sieved hash to take away to place weed would small too much. I wash the ground up bud. Leave to dry bone dry. Then extract. Not odorless but does not linger like skunks. Ice water washed also. Taste i washed out. It is special hash, not 2.00pm smoke time in work.<br /><br />Codeine does hangovers.<br /><br />Tried methadone once. Never again.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So my warning list right now is extensive. But the food in the fridge comes first. Real life is paid for and I sometimes indulge. Got to be cautious but in real life I got temptation.<br /><br />But I got a women who will watch me intake. She does coke a few times. Since h found SR she and her posse of girly friends do like to dress up have some lines and stay as one. They were wasting money on the usual UK coke (10% shit that 90% cuts ruin for you) <br /><br />Coke&nbsp; is a worry. Even if I used once a week would that 100mg always be enough?<br /><br />But I can cut it out of my women and friends are not using each weekend. Hard not to say &#039;no&#039;.

				i don&#039;t mean to offend you, and i only say this because i care about other people&#039;s health, but taking mdma every weekend is very stupid, and not just &#039;not recommended&#039; (although i did the same for a while).&nbsp; there are not only tolerance issues but it&nbsp; is also highly neurotoxic, possibly cardiotoxic as well, and so is unsuitable for weekly use. ketamine also isn&#039;t good for your body if used regularly<br /><br />the only drugs that are safe for weekly use are certain psychedelics like LSD and shrooms, but it doesn&#039;t sound like you are interested in those kinds of drugs. I would recommend cannabis or a low dose of adderall.&nbsp;

				Yeah I understand obviously any drug used weekly is bad, and i&#039;m not keen on doing LSD/ Shrooms every weekend as I don&#039;t want to ruin my mind. It&#039;s just ever since I tried drugs, I haven&#039;t enjoyed alcohol, been off weed for a year as well and i&#039;m not keen on getting back into it. I&#039;m gunna space out my Rolls A LOT more, just I cannot sit at a party sober, it drives me crazy.

				stephen, re-read my initial one. It sounds like your a alot younger than everyone here who posted. <br />Noone really does lsd/mushies weekly, but if they did (and they were EMOTIONALLY &amp; INTELLECTUALLY stable) their minds wouldn&#039;t be ruined.<br /><br />on the other hand...if i expanded your frame of though..how your down..trying to escape reality...being sober at a party drives you crazy?<br /><br />i can only derive one thing....you really have no control on the wheel and you are trying to replace the driver with a drug. <br /><br /><br />I love tits

				I can&#039;t speak to LSD, but you can do DMT and shrooms WAY more than twice a year. If I wait 10 days between shroom trips I don&#039;t notice a tolerance, and you can re-dose DMT every hour.

				Getting to the higher plateaus on DXM would certainly be worthy if you haven&#039;t done it. With DXM, it&#039;s also easy to get and comes with little risk.
