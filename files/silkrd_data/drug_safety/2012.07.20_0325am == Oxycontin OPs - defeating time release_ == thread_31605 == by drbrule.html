				Okay, I know there&#039;s dozens of methods on this just about everywhere, so don&#039;t jump down my throat please&nbsp; :) I&#039;m just looking for your personal opinion and experience. I&#039;d like to hear input from the SR crowd who tends to be a bit more intelligent and sophisticated than the average person&nbsp; ;) How effective are these methods at defeating the time release? What is your preferred method? Does it feel the same as an IR dose or does it feel like some of the OC is lost?<br /><br />The most common method seems to be microwave -&gt; crush -&gt; mix in coca-cola -&gt; let it sit -&gt; down the hatch. I&#039;m only looking for oral use, so that might make it easier. I figure I might not even have to mix it in coke, just eat the powder, or even just chew up the pill if possible.&nbsp; I have a slight tolerance, my usual dose is around 50mg. Sometimes I feel like god, sometimes i feel nothing at all, like taking an aspirin. I just don&#039;t want to waste any of this precious drug, and OPs are fucking ridiculously cheaper than the increasingly rare OPs and IR Oxycodone.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I was Lucky enough to be Prescribed a 90 Count of Old School OC 80&#039;s for several years till 2010 when TRF&#039;s came along.<br />Oxycodone has a very decent absorption rate when swallowed and a higher kick when snorted of course. The new ones just gum up your nose. That being said, the best Method for the New OP&#039;s is to borrow a Dremel,<br /><br />Slice, chop and powder the Mother Fuckers to a fine ass Powder, then chug the powder down w your fav beverage.<br /><br />Tried &quot;crisping&quot; tried alcohol, you name it. Biggest bang for your buck is a Dremel. If not, a single edge Razor and a hammer taps to make a min of 12 pill pieces out of pill will work too.

				Those little fuckers are hard to break down! I didn&#039;t have a whole lot to work with, but I ended up keeping it in the baggie and smashing it with a 3 wood&nbsp; :). Not the most sophisticated method I know, but after 5 minutes and a broken overhead light I&#039;m pretty sure I crushed it enough to break the time release.

				Cool, thanks guys. It sounds like a pain in the ass but with a little bit of time and elbow grease we can accomplish anything&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I hope the pharm companies and the government realize this is ridiculous and only going to make things worse and more dangerous. People are going to get high, no matter what, they&#039;ll always find a way. I bet this has done nothing but cause people to shoot jelly like fillers and shit into their veins, or move on to heroin because they can&#039;t get satisfaction/pain relief out of these fucking things.

				i have only tried one method, but it seemed to work very well. i put 2 OP 80mg tablets in a shot glass full of everclear alcohol. (very high % of alcohol) i let it sit in the alcohol for 24 hours.&nbsp; After this i put the shot glass with the pills in it in the microwave for 45 seconds. by this time they had pretty much dissolved and it completely broke the time release. so i just drank half the shot (80mg) and got very high very quick
