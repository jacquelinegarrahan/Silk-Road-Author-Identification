				How do you consume MDMA crystals?<br /><br />Like you&#039;d do with pills?&nbsp; (candies).<br /><br />Thanks.

				I will always parachute all mine from now on, instead of taking them in caps. Caps take forever to dissolve in your stomach, so the come-up and initial peak never really get me as far as I want to go...<br /><br />Now parachuting (taking 1 play of toilet paper, wrapping around the powder, swallowing with water) always works wonders for me, hits fast and hard, just the way I like it.

				Whenever I try to explain to people what a parachute is, I tell them to imagine a gel cap, just made out of toilet paper. That&#039;s what you&#039;re going for essentially.

				If your a man, lines will get you going quick.&nbsp; 50mg a shot.&nbsp; <br /><br />MDMA is also highly water soulable so you can make a nice Edrink.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gelcaps or parachuting is probably the easiest way, gel caps being the best as you can pre-make and bring them whereever you go.&nbsp;

				What about drinking beer before or during the parachute event?<br /><br />How does alcohol interact with MDMA?&nbsp; How well do they along?&nbsp; :D<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have rolling papers on hand, so I&#039;ll just use a spoon to dump the powder in my mouth and then drink some water to wash it down.&nbsp; Tastes disgusting if it sits in the mouth too long but it&#039;s not really a huge deal.<br /><br />Alcohol seems to be generally discouraged when using MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed it can increase nausea, and of course&nbsp; dehydration.&nbsp; But I enjoy having 2-3 drinks before a roll to get warmed up.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be dancing, I would avoid mixing the two.

				I&#039;m not worried about dehydration, but rather of alcohol cancelling the effect of MDMA thus wasting it...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well in my experience it has never cancelled the effects, no matter how much I drank beforehand.&nbsp; Weed on the other hand, I find can completely dull the effects of the MDMA and create more anxiety.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really ever drink during a roll, so I don&#039;t know how that would effect it.

				Yeah not a fan of alcohol on mdma, find it makes me want to puke which is unpleasant and I cant (un?)focus on tripping balls. Lately Ive been mixing it in a non-alcoholic drink beforehand, usually a small glass of fruit juice, but my old method used to be parachuting/gelcap as seems to be popular in this thread.<br />Had a friend who swore that hooping (putting it in his ass w/ water based lube in gelcap) was the best high cause it bypassed his stomach or some theory like that.. but never tried myself that&#039;s exit only hah

				I usually crush some and do a line, and parachute the rest with 1-ply of toilet paper - like someone else said.<br /><br />I was in the UK over the summer and the people I partied with loved emptying out cold and flu pills and refilling that with MDMA. Silly.

				Just got my order!&nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow is the day!<br /><br />The crystals are inside a small and nicely sealed plastic packet.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m afraid that if I open it then humidity may spoil the crystals, just like cocaine well get moisture/sticky if you leave it open for too long.<br /><br />Do crystals have this problem?&nbsp; I want to avoid the crystals sticking to the plastic, making it hard to handle it.<br /><br />I received 1g, so I&#039;ll divide it in 5 equal parts (200mg), and parachute one part.<br /><br />Sounds like a good plan?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to hear your opinions!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Thanks!

The potency can vary in the crystals also although usually it&#039;s at least above the 70% range. Really depends on how much tolerance you got under your shoulders. For me 120-140mg will make me rolls balls :) And no, humidity really does not do that much bad for crystal MDMA what I&#039;ve heard.<br /><br />But yea 200mg sounds rather much at least from my view, thou it is a relatively safe/small dose after all. <br />Have a nice roll.

				Hey Mito!<br /><br />Nice to see youve got your MDMA ;) Parachuting gives a little stomach discomfort on the start of the roll but not as bad as nose discomfort if you snort it so parachuting seems to be the way to go :) Dont eat to much before you start your roll and dosage wise I always say to people 2mg per kilo of bodyweight, 200 should really be heavy but fun :D<br /><br />Warm greetings,<br /><br />Mitanox

				Parachuting is for sure the way to go.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t think of it a long time ago, to be honest.&nbsp; For years, I just took it orally with no covering (popped the caps open and dropped it on my tongue).&nbsp; It tastes awful, but I kinda developed a fondness for that horrible flavor... Even now, I&#039;ll do a little fingerlick with any new stuff I get just to check it out.<br /><br />Snorting... just, no.&nbsp; It hurts a lot.&nbsp; And it speeds up the timeframe of the whole experience by a LOT.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have spent all your seratonin within about an hour of coming up off the line.&nbsp; You&#039;ll roll nuts, for sure, but it always disappoints me.&nbsp; All the times I&#039;ve done it, I ended up doing way more than I should throughout the night trying to chase that feeling.&nbsp; Just parachute it and have fun, imo.<br /><br />Just got some new stuff today, actually... I really, really wish I could finalize the order. :(&nbsp; It looks amazing.
