				Alright, first thing is first... Have you ever used any psychedelics before? If not I would suggest trying mushrooms or LSD first.<br />As for DMT, there are two primary ways to take it (although there are some others, but for your first time either smoke it or make ayahuasca/pharmahuasca).<br /><br />Smoked DMT only lasts about 15-25 minutes give or take. Its like being shot out of your body at lightening speed and flying through the universe discovering infinite knowledge and cosmic awareness along the way. You may encounter entities with a breakthrough dose. Nobody can tell you what it will be like as its different for everyone, I always like to say let go of all preconceptions of what the psychedelic experience will be like and just let it take you wherever it takes you.<br /><br />You can take it orally by mixing it with an MAOI (mono amine oxidase inhibitor). This will make it last approx 4 hours + but it wont be quite as intense (dose dependent) and the effects are a little different. To take it orally you can use plants to inhibit monoamine oxidase such as cappi or syrian rue, or pure harmala alkaloids (which you can find on SR). You need to follow a diet if you are using it via this manner as certain foods or medications can react badly with MAOIs causing a hypertensive crisis.
