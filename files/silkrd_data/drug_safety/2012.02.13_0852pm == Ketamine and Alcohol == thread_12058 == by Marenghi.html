				<br />The official line is don&#039;t mix your downers and dissociatives. Doing K after drinking lots makes a lot of people vomit which is pretty dangerous if you K hole as you could choke and not realise. <br />In practice, if you have a couple of beers and some small bumps you shouldn&#039;t come to much harm. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever done K without drinking.<br />K doesn&#039;t depress the respiratory system like a lot of anaesthetics do.

				It is relatively safe, but if you are really drunk you might not remember the khole and you may experience some nausea. If you are not trying to khole then you are just wasting your k imo.

				Probably not safe practice but coke and ket is a good combo imo, especially when your on ecstasy.

				Agree with the other respondents, there is no enhancement, and a risk of (at best) sleeping through the K experience, or worse, depending on quantities consumed of each.<br /><br />Equally, you don&#039;t have to be completely alcohol-free, but you should be nowhere near drunk. Social is fine, slurring is not.<br /><br />As the others have said, because K has strong sedative effects, if you&#039;re combining it with anything, the other stuff should be stimulant in nature. Best times for me are coming down from mdma, buzzed and relaxed enough to enjoy a really rich experience, probably having had a mixer drink though when getting in after the club.<br /><br />Which is another point, if you&#039;ve not tried K before, you&#039;re best doing it behind closed doors with a small group of trusted companions. K-holing in public is not a good look...!<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Ketamine_Combinations.shtml<br /><br />
