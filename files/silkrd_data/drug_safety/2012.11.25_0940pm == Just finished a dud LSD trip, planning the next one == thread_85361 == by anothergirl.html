				TL;DR: So I took an alleged 150 micrograms of LSD and nothing happened, and here I sit disappointed and pondering how long should I wait before trying again with a double (triple?) dose.<br /><br />So long version, pot makes me anxious and uncomfortable (although I&#039;ve yet to be able to try it in the privacy of my home), and I had a dose of shrooms that made me laugh a lot and some things look kinda weird (no visuals per se) although haven&#039;t been able to get a second go at shrooms, and now I finally got my hands on some LSD (from a seller on SR whose reviews seem to say he is a trusted seller of good acid whom I won&#039;t name since I don&#039;t want to make this a review of his wares) and so I excitedly waited for the perfect day to devote to it, and unfortunately 10 hours later my trip has never made it off the tarmac, although I took notes as follows.<br /><br />0 hours: Put the tab under my tongue after waking and showering and no breakfast, let it melt for a good 5 minutes before washing it down with coffee. Paid careful attention but no taste whatsoever. Played SMB1 and SMB3 for an hour.<br /><br />1 hour: nervous and tense, probably psychosomatic.<br /><br />2 hours: Even more nervous and tense and now a little nauseous. I noticed that as the vent of the heater opened and closed it looked like the parallel filter opening was moving along with it, which seemed neat, but I later confirmed this to be just a regular optical illusion with a chronic sober friend. In addition to tense and nausea and bleh I feel somehow light and heavy at the same time, but again nothing i haven&#039;t experienced when I caught a cold virus...<br /><br />3 hours: I invited a friend over and I was able to have a normal conversation as usual.<br /><br />I seem to notice some things like how big the letters here are in notepad, and some metal sheets outside my window looked like klansmen due to the placement of bolts as their eyes but I&#039;m probably trying too hard to notice them. It was a bit funnier than it should have been I&#039;d say. I would compare it to being a little drunk while seasick. I do notice circular things tend to &quot;get bigger&quot; with some ease if stared at, but this is again similar to the kind of distortions you can see in your peripheral vision when you focus on something while sober.<br /><br />4 hours: Realized nothing was happening so went shopping for dinner. I noticed more details around me outside than I normally would, but that was probably because I was looking for something. As with any other drug, when I&#039;m not feeling anxious the one thing I can say is that music sounds really good, although this might just be not caring and turning it up louder when high.<br /><br />5 hours: Give up, blow the rest of my day doing what I normally would have such as my day job, watching the news, jogging, etc.<br /><br />9 hours: Edit and make this post.<br /><br />Any LSD-experienced types care to offer me advice on making the most of the 9 remaining hits I have without overdoing it? And is 48 hours enough of a wait before dosing again or will I have a tolerance? I had based the rest of my year around having this behind me so I don&#039;t really want to wait too long...<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot about &quot;dud hits&quot; so I&#039;m wary of doing 3 at once in case the others are stronger, but I also don&#039;t want to spend another day like this...<br /><br />If only we didn&#039;t live in a world of mindless authoritarianism forcing us to risk our freedom to obtain this stuff, I wouldn&#039;t have to spend so much time thinking about &quot;making the most of it&quot; and whatnot and could just go to a market every weekend to find what works for me, but it could well be a long time before I get my hands on any more mind-altering substances so as it is these 9 tiny pieces of paper are quite precious...<br />

				hey anothergirl,<br /><br />it is a bad sign when you feel anxious on weed. From my own experience I can tell you that it is connected to psychological trauma I suffered during my childhood. It could be possible that your mind has built very strong barriers around your own trauma. Stanislaf Grov (a Czech psychologist and inventor of holotropic breathing) reported that some people can take 1000 micrograms of LSD and still keep their mind closed to it. I would really recommend you an experienced sitter for your next try. Someone you really like and that is capable of dealing with difficult mental states eg. crying etc.

Thing is, I&#039;m pretty anxious and self-conscious even normally, so I guess weed just exacerbates it.<br /><br />As for as sitter, I don&#039;t even know anyone I&#039;d tell I HAD the LSD, much less ask them to sit with me. I live in a very conservative society where I believe even testing positive for drugs in a hospital during unrelated treatment can get you jail time, and possession of LSD would probably be serious years of prison.

				I would wait at least three days, and increase the dosage by half a blotter. This should be 225 micrograms, which is around ideal amount for a good LSD trip. But it may actually be much less than that, if the last one was a dud.<br /><br />Since you don&#039;t have a sitter, how will you ensure that you will have a good trip?

				Thanks!<br /><br />I was gonna bump it to 2.5 in 72 hours but I&#039;ll consider 2 or 1.5 tabs...

Since drugs make me anxious and want to be alone, the last thing I&#039;d do is go outside or far from home unless I was feeling fantastic about it...<br /><br />Is it naive to say I&#039;d rather have a bad trip than no trip at all--that I&#039;d rather go to Silent Hill than nowhere?

				Once took 3 tabs of acid and felt nothing after an hour and a half, was super angry so I was just gonna make myself a snack and go to bed. Turns out I hadn&#039;t eaten all day and after I ate my sandwich I started feeling the acid come on. I have no science to back it up but from this day on I always dose on a full stomach.<br />Also I&#039;m pretty sure random drugs don&#039;t just show up in blood processing. They have to be looking for said drugs in the first place. I used to have blood tests all the time when I was younger and nothing was ever brought to my attention.

				The strength of the tabs are either way less than 150ug (degraded due to poor storage or product way weaker than advertized) or there is some other factor preventing their effect such as taking anti-depressants or other drugs that counter-act LSD.<br /><br />Anything over 75 ug should be clearly noticeable - suggest you wait 5 days and take 3 tabs if you&#039;re not on meds. <br />If you&#039;re on anti-depressants the problem is different and it is entirely possible you just wont get any effects as long as you are on those.

Perhaps I&#039;ll take some of my fruit stock at the start of the trip then rather than later, and then I&#039;ll end up with the same (presumable) superstition as you :)<br /><br />As for the drug test thing, I was thinking more along the lines of if I freaked out and some idiot called the cops or the hospital it would be a disaster. <br /><br />Also in most reasonable countries I believe doctors are ethically prohibited from testing you just because they feel like it and/or sharing this with anyone.<br /><br />Anyway when I wake up it will have been 4 days and I&#039;m still hovering between 2 and 3 tabs when I do. Thanks for the replies.

				Also, I always eat fresh grapefruit before I trip. Again I have zero science to back this up, but I used to take two tabs of hunabku when going to partys/raves for years. Same acid every time spaced out the same time, I was pretty familiar with the experience. Then I heard all the rumors that grapefruit effects acid and over ripe mango effects thc but no one actually knew. So one day I said fuck it and tried each. Can&#039;t say much about the mango, but about half an hour after eating the grapefruit I took my two tabs. At 45 minutes I was having noticeably stronger visuals than normal and amazing CEVs (fractals, mind mapping, reliving memories) and I can honestly say the grapefruit increased the visuals during my entire trip two fold. So I always eat a light meal with a grapefruit before my trip&nbsp; ;D

Fwiw I had this strip delivered to me while I was overseas as it seemed a lot safer than having it delivered home (contrary to what many would say).<br /><br />Thing is, I really liked the feeling--almost to the point where I would want to spend a night like that every weekend--but it just wasn&#039;t anything like I though LSD was supposed to be. It was basically like eating a space cake but less intoxicating and more introspective and focused (not so rambling like THC) and with no sleepiness afterwards.<br /><br />I ended up going the long way to a supermarket at 3AM at the peak of my trip, and along the way I ended up staring at ducks in the middle of the freezing night (across from a police station, heh), and although I have lived here for a decade and was hardly ever even aware of the ducks, I was fascinated by them like a kid and I fed them crumbs on the way home, something else I&#039;ve never done before.<br /><br />Anyway I could write a short story about what an epic journey it was in terms of and all the things I noticed and the insights I had, but the thing is I didn&#039;t see or hear a damn thing that wasn&#039;t always there--not even the echoes or enhanced background noise or zoomed tunnel vision like with pot. It&#039;s just like, music was more meaningful, streetlights were shinier, and I was so happy just to be out looking at shit that is usually so boring I never even noticed it. Something I could get used to, but if you asked me if I know what an &quot;acid trip&quot; is, I&#039;d still have to say no. <br /><br />Oh well, I guess 4 tabs next time, and then I&#039;ll have to find a way to get more. Sometimes I think of what I&#039;d give up just to get a visa in a more laid-back country...

				Just to update, it turns out it was me apparently.<br /><br />After I tried 1 tab and then 2 tabs from the other side of the strip as stated above, I decided to dose a friend with a single tab who has never tried any drug but a few beers, and she is in a different fucking universe right now.<br /><br />First she was giggling, then I left her for a moment and she screamed bloody murder.<br /><br />When I came back she was staring at the ceiling, unresponsive.<br /><br />Once I was back she was giggling again, but she still won&#039;t respond when I ask her what she&#039;s giggling about.<br /><br />Then she started crying (streaming tears) while giggling at the same time, apparently because I told her I can&#039;t carry her downstairs to the bathroom. <br /><br />Eventually I got her to say that I was on a river talking to a fish, and that when she heard a sound &quot;every cell in my body responded&quot;, but other than that she&#039;s just sitting beside me giggling and moaning. Taking care of her is way more of a trip than the acid was.<br /><br />Anyway, apparently the shit I have is legit and I do in fact just suck at tripping (or for some reason require a triple dose or greater as I have yet to trip).

How you feel someone giving a speech to a group of fish I don&#039;t know, but I gotta say I&#039;m jealous. <br /><br />10 hours on she was really upset that it hadn&#039;t ended and she was convinced she wouldn&#039;t wake up for work the next morning (this was still 6PM mind you), but I reassured her by setting 3 alarms and promising to let her stay over and personally wake her up. Even the next day she said she was a bit scared of other people (calling the police on her), but after a full 24 hours apparently she&#039;s back to normal.<br /><br />Another 5 days have passed since my failed trip so in a couple of hours 5 of those fuckers are going under my tongue, which is basically the end of my stash :(&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My logic is that with 6 tabs remaining, I could bump it up just to 3 and hope to have a full-on trip, but if that still disappointed me I&#039;d be left with only 3, which would mean I spent 160 bucks and still never got what I wanted even once. On the other hand, if I increase it even higher I should be guaranteed something different from the 1- and 2-tab trips, and that still leaves me with a single tab which I can use later for a mild experience in a park or arcade or something, as the previous trips were still pleasurable experiences.<br /><br />Man I type too much.

It took me 4 tabs to finally trip and it was great, but I didn&#039;t want to come back and vainly bump my own topic with a bunch of tldr crap. But now that it&#039;s bumped I will :)<br /><br />I was watching Fear and Loathing while I waited, and then when the visuals (which were just &quot;pulsing textures&quot; and &quot;uncountable constantly changing and moving grains&quot; type things in the walls) kicked in I felt this release that I&#039;d finally got what I&#039;d been waiting for, and I just burst into manic laughter that wouldn&#039;t stop for 3 whole hours. I have never, ever laughed so hard or for so long alone or with anyone in my life. Pausing the movie to go urinate every 5 minutes (by far the most annoying aspect, as by the end of the day my pockets were full of candies from a dozen convenience stores because I just could not walk 50 yards without needing to use a bathroom) and seeing how the visuals had changed slightly each time, and stopping to stare at shit and talk to myself about how, maybe colors originally used to be this bright and nobody ever had to go to piss ever, but the fall of man had robbed us of it and the LSD allowed me to glimpse Eden and turned my dingy bleak winter kitchen into a bright fruity jungle of red kettles and green coffee cans and orange... oranges, and this bleary cycle of bliss just whisked that time right out from under my nose and the next thing I knew it was 3 hours later and I was thinking fuck it--I&#039;m going outside. A few times it got intense but I never approached a bad trip. In fact save for when I stared at a person&#039;s face too long and tempted their eyes to blend together and recoiled in horror when they did, it would be hard for me to even imagine what a bad trip would be like.<br /><br />I should either have a sheet any day now, or get arrested for attempting to acquire said sheet. In the former case, I will probably take 4 or 5 tabs instantly after a well-earned sigh of relief, and in the latter case, well, I&#039;ll bump this topic some 10 years from now, because well, that&#039;s the punishment my government dishes out to people who like substances other than alcohol, and they have essentially a 100% conviction rate so you&#039;re guilty whether you are or not, and I actually am :/

Now that I know I like LSD (and shrooms) I&#039;ve researched a lot of other drugs I want to try like MDMA or K or DMT, but the only way I can safely get my hands on them is getting a hotel room for long periods of time on another country where I can receive domestically and more safely, which A isn&#039;t an optimal setting including the time limit and B is an expensive-as-hell hobby to have.
