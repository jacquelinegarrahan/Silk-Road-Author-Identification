				I&#039;ve heard from a lot of people that if you hold in your meth smoke, the meth re-recrystallizes in your lungs.<br />I&#039;ve also heard from a lot of people that it&#039;s just a myth.<br /><br />What are your opinions? I haven&#039;t been able to determine whether it does or not&nbsp; :-\

				This is a false claim as crystallized methamphetamine is always in the form of a salt (usually methamphetamine hydrochloride), which is highly soluble in water, as well as hydrophilic, and is instantly absorbed into the user&#039;s blood stream via the alveoli.<br /><br />No worries.

				I also heard the same thing the whole inside of the pipe gets crystallized so why wouldn&#039;t your lungs I don&#039;t know but I smoked a lot of it and if my lungs are crystals they still wotk I&#039;ve been clean for 6 yrs

				I suppose its a myth then, though hadn&#039;t heard it before. I wonder who came up with that idea in the first place - perhaps it was coined by the anti-drug evangelists to scare people?

				I&#039;m assuming this idea was formed when people were smoking off tin foil. Sometimes they would overheat the product, causing burns to their lungs. (From hot vapor, as well as adulterants from foil.) This leading to their chest being sore and them being stimulated allowed for their minds to wonder the possibilities of what happened. Not to mention that meth tends to lower pain threshold and one doesn&#039;t realize how sore their lungs are until the comedown. <br /><br />It could also be since meth comes in shards more often than other drugs. Most people didn&#039;t have much experience with crystals. Lack of knowledge in chemistry could lead to this myth.

				The meth does crystallizes in your lungs and throat just like you pipe, but being water soluble it is absorbed directly into the blood stream. This is suggested why smoking meth last longer than it should. Vaporizing street meth will hurt your lungs due to improper cleaning and additives whether you hold it in or not.<br /><br />&nbsp;Personal experience I prefer to get a lung full, exhale 1/4 then inhale again. repeat 4 or five times keeping the smoke moving and not allowing the non water soluble parts to settle. Result is less product needed and less of the sharp pain in the lungs you can sometimes get after a big pipe.

				It does NOT recrystalize... its just an urban legend.<br /><br />Crystallization occurs during the transition from liquid to solid phase. Meth needs to be over 170°C to melt into a liquid, and you can be sure getting any kind of 170°C liquid in your lungs would cause a lot more problems (if it were survivable at all) than crystallization.<br /><br />Now think for a moment about why it is you never want to exhale though a pipe that has some resin buildup... If you&#039;re not sure why, try exhaling through a cloudy pipe and you&#039;ll be saying &quot;Dude, where&#039;s my resin?&quot; as it&#039;s dissolved by the moisture in your breath. That same moist air is always in your lungs.
