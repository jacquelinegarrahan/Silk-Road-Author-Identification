				welcome to the amphetamine world. i think just about everyone has either had marathon sex or masturbated for extreme amounts of time on amphets. to the point that their dick might hurt(me if it gets really bad)<br />you are programming yourself though. so unless you want to become a sex addict in sober life, i wouldnt recommend filling your highs with jack-off sessions.

				This is basically why I&#039;m probably not go to take amps anymore.&nbsp; It makes me way to obsessed with sex. The next day I feel really dirty. I also feel like I &quot;wasted&quot; it. Originally I took it because I wanted to be more productive and motivated on creative projects but instead it throws me into the gutter every time. Think I&#039;m going to switch to psychedelics. I already tried 2cb and like it a lot better.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t make me nearly as horny as amps despite it being originally sold as a aphrodisiac.
