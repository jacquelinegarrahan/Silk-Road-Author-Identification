				I&#039;ve received some powder methadone recently from SR. I&#039;m sure you all know whose I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />Has anyone had experience with insufflating this stuff? How can I safely take 130mg and accurately dose 20-30mg out of that (without a scale)? Should I add inert material? Is it a better idea just to do it orally?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out here. Peace.

				I wouldn&#039;t really suggest snorting it.&nbsp; I imagine it would burn quite a bit.&nbsp; And there isn&#039;t really any reason to do that.&nbsp; Depending on your tolerance, put 20-30mg in some juice and drink it all.&nbsp; It will take some time to take effect, probably a few hours, although you should feel something in the first hour.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you have to be careful with methadone.&nbsp; Some people take a dose, don&#039;t feel anything, then take some more, 3-4 hours later they are overdosing.

				Well, I just snorted a very small amount. And Yeah, it burned like fuck. <br /><br />Although I (unsafely) took a dose without exact measurement, comparing the amount I did to the amount left over (if the &#039;130mg&#039; label is to be assumed true), then what I just did can be no more than 20mg. Probably closer to 10mg<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;m mildly opiate tolerant at this point. I took a dose of sub 20 hours before the &#039;done, but that dose was only 1mg, and had only been taking sub for less than a week prior to this.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update my experience later on.
