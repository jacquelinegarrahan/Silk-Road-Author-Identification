				I&#039;ve had Kidney Problems the last two times I&#039;ve done MXE.&nbsp; Like all the signs of a Kidney stone.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been snorting for almost a year and never had any problems until the past month.&nbsp; I got stuff from a different person this time and I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s bad MXE?

				I have no idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had any kind of kidney pain or anything.&nbsp; I went to the Dr and they thought it was a kidney stone but I had snorted MXE about 2 days prior to getting the kidney pain.&nbsp; I thought it was probably a kidney stone also but no stone.&nbsp; I snorted MXE again a few weeks later (last week) and got the same kidney pain the next day.&nbsp; What sucks is I use MXE to help with my depression and don&#039;t want to go back on meds.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been doing MXE every other day for the past few months.&nbsp; &nbsp;No problem here at all.<br /><br />I do it sublingual, no snorting.<br /><br />I chug liters of water though and pee alot during the MXE sessions.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t do more than 50mg every session.

				I&#039;ve been using MXE and IM ketamine heavily for about a year and I developed a kidney stone a few months ago <br /><br />This is just anecdotal of course<br /><br />

				It&#039;s been the new stuff I got.&nbsp; The last two times so I&#039;m thinking I got some bad shit.&nbsp; Does anyone have recommendations for sellers?&nbsp; Preferably in the US.&nbsp; I know since the ban things have been weird in the MXE market.&nbsp;

				MXE is known as the &quot;bladder-friendly&quot; Ketamine to some people, but I don&#039;t know about kidneys...<br /><br />I do know I&#039;ve done a lot of MXE in every available ROA but plugging (Oral, Nasal, Sublingual, IM, IV, and even transdermally with DMSO [not that effective but a fun experiment])&nbsp; And have had no problems so far.&nbsp; Keep up with your doctor and take a break on MXE and K for a while to be on the safe side.&nbsp; <br /><br />It may not always be my motto, but a good one is &quot;Moderation and Honesty&quot; with yourself and drugs.

				Yeah.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna lay off of the MXE for a bit.&nbsp; It&#039;s been my main drug of choice since last Dec.&nbsp; Just ordered some MDMA and hoping to enjoy some nice rolls.&nbsp; But if anyone has suggestions for MXE vendors that has quality product please pass it along.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna give it another shot in a month or so.&nbsp;
