				I hate smoking so am always looking for alternative ROAs but having failed at my first pharmahuasca attempt (Syrian Rue seeds + yellow fluff DMT) I said fuck it and loaded up a bowl in my bong.<br /><br />So I lined my screen with ash from Salvia (I don&#039;t smoke pot) so on top of this I made a bed of about 50mg of DMT. I lit up without letting the flame touch the crystals and sucked in. You can sort of tease the lighter til some of the DMT melts and back off and the residual heat is enough to burn up the rest. The bowl and neck of the bong fills up with thick white smoke that smells like shit. It literally has a smell that reminds me of sewage. Anyway, I cleared all this powder and smoke in two giant lungfuls and held in each about 10 secs.<br /><br />I was pinned to the screen and the lines of text on the monitor in front of me sort of vibrated. I was definitely stoned and the whole thing lasted about 5 minutes then let up but no CEVs much less open eyed visuals. I could foreseeably double up to about 100mg but will probably end up burning my thumb with the lighter as it&#039;s really hard to coordinate when you&#039;re this smashed.<br /><br />Same thing pretty much happens with Salvia. I&#039;m the only guy I know of that can smoke heroic rips of 100x Salvia and get only mild effects other than being pinned to the chair like with DMT. Just sucks that this is my luck with DMT too!

				Never heard of that before, a buddy of mine has a hard time getting any effects from psychedelics (Needs 3 hits of good acid to feel anything). He had to take 3mg of 25i to feel anything from it, and some people have OD&#039;d on 2mg! But he still got completely fucked off DMT.<br /><br />Maybe take a break from all drugs for a few days then try 75mg+. Try to vaporize it, you could just not be doing it right. I really have no clue.<br /><br />I know there were a few times where after I did MDMA, I smoked 100mg of DMT and didn&#039;t break through. I smoked another 75mg 4 minutes later then ANOTHER 75mg another 5 minutes later. So that&#039;s a quarter gram of DMT in under 10 minutes and I didn&#039;t breakthrough at all (Ended up tripping out really fucking badly and had my one and old bad trip on DMT EVER). Pretty sure its cause my receptors were fucked up from the MDMA though, could be similar with something you are doing? I highly doubt it, but its a possibility.

				Could be that. I had earlier in the day messed with DMT orally and Syrian Rue seeds in search of a good time that never came but other than that two weeks straight with nothing so hard as coffee. But, like you said, it still could be that I was piggybacking that hit like a second fiddle that DMT should never be.<br /><br />On the other hand I do have a box vaporizer but can&#039;t really see how to burn a powder in it without making a wasteful mess.
