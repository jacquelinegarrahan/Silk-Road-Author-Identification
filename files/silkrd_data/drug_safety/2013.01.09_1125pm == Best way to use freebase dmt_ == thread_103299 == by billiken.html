				Well boys and girls, i started this new topic becausei need your help!<br /><br />3 weeks ago i ordered 500mg of freebase DMT, it arrived like a week ago to destination.<br /><br />I was happy that i was going to try it, but i encountered problems, and here its what happened:<br /><br />I bought a vaporizer, because i thought &quot;oh its cool, im going to try to get the best experience out of it&quot; So i split the 500mg into 10 doses, after seeing the erowid dosage for smoking dmt. Then i put it on the vaporizer and smoked it, but i did not get me as high as i wanted to, i only got a little buzz. At first i thought it was the quality of the dmt, but it was from a solid vendor who only sells dmt from time to time, so i thought it was my smoking method.<br />Thats when i chose my pipe, the one i usually use for smoking weed, but i realized it was kinda big for only one dose, so i added a screen to it. After that, i put the dmt on the screen and i burnt it with my lighter, i saw how fast it vanished, and i took the longest and hardest hit i ever had. That shit instantly burnt my lungs and throat , they&nbsp; both were on fire, but i instantly started tripping harder than before, but still..i did not get to the level i wanted, so i put another dose of dmt and did the same thing. But that did not change it only got me a little higher.<br />Thats when i said to my self, fuck this shit&nbsp; i want to be like the kid on Enter The Void, so i mixed 3 doses and said fuck it , so i snorted all that shit in less than 10 seconds. That was so fucking ugly, it burnt like a motherfucker, so both my lungs and nose now were burning like hell, but hey finally, right after snorting around 150mg of dmt i got into the Enter The Void level and i was tripping balls.<br /><br />I know i wasted dmt by doing all that stupid shit, so please save the insults, i know i shouldnt have done that, and it was even more retarded to snort that freebase dmt, but i was pissed at that time lol, so i just did it.<br /><br />So thats why i need your help, im about to order some more dmt and i want to know the best way to use it, so i can get to that level without wasting it and fucking up my nose and lungs in the process.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Best way to smoke it is in a glass bubbler or a glass pipe. Or in a herbal mixture. 50 - 100 mg vaporised should be ample to properl you well beyond threshold. Just smoke and when you think you have had enough smoke some more until your vision literally shatters into a million pieces and you see the veil or our reality ripped away from you and you are propelled into a parallel reality...

				I built an elf machine. Basically just like a crack pipe inserted into a second larger chamber. I made a heating element with a smaller piece of chore wrapped in a pipe screen that i insert into the pipe after the dmt (be sure to burn off any oils or residues on the chore prior to smoking by torching it while holding with pliers or you will get some nasty shit in your hit) After I melt the dmt with a low even drag with the element in place. I then take that out of the end of the pipe and then vaporize the dmt by pulling slowly and evenly being careful not to torch the chore. I have blasted way out on 25mg of rogerpetes stuff. It is very clean. Lungs had no pain at all. Worth the higher price. You may find on DMT nexus website instructions for an inspirator mk11 or something. The concept was borrowed from that but without the ceramic fiber heating element. Chore is easy to get and cheap as shit. I too spent stupid money on a vapor buddy pipe and torch lighters with mixed results and ended up riding a $10 elf machine into hyperspace with much better results. Remember pull slow and even. DMT will run from heat and you can pull it through to fast and some spice will melt and pull through before it vaporizes.

				I bought a GVG Sherlock http://www.vaporgenie.com/products/glass-vg-vapes/glass-sherlock-vg-details<br /><br />and cut a Volcano liquid pad down to size <br /><br />http://www.everyonedoesit.co.uk/online_headshop/volcano-vaporiser-liquid-pads.cfm<br /><br />I can&#039;t compare this method to any other but i&#039;ve had some crazy times doing it this way and i&#039;ve used DMT from 3 different vendors.

				Personally, Ive tried several methods and will list them all:<br /><br />Freebase, in a joint sprinkled on top of a layer of tobacco, approximately 50mg (eyeballed). To share with my significant other, has allowed for quite a relaxing effect for about 5 minutes. Some nice geometric-pattern based visuals and very mild closed eye visuals (CEVs). Bit of a waste but its nice for relieving the days tension without blasting off.<br /><br />In Changa. Using approx 200mg of freebase dissolved into 5ml of pure isopropyl alcohol, then placing your herb of choice into the liquid (in my case I used Passionflower herb which has mild MAOI effects to prolong the experience). I used about half a gram of passionflower in the alcohol-dmt solution and allowed to evaporate overnight; infusing the herb with DMT. By then smoking normally through a bong/water pipe I found breakthroughs were quite achievable with generous cone-sizes. The prolonging effect of the passionflower stretched out each cone to about 20 mins long, with the first 5 minutes being in hyperspace..<br /><br />Freebase in a glass vaporiser. Not my preferred method as the technique must be exceptionally good and is often more trouble than its worth. If youre an experienced vaporiser (ie. ice or meth or crack through a glass pipe) then its worth a shot. Risk of burning the liquid and producing an ugly tasting vapour is the trouble here. Breaking through with 1 hit is very rare unless your technique is good OR you have a chore boy (piece of wire scrubber) in there. I have a glass pipe called The Ubie and have another meth pipe (bulb type) on the way and will give that a go. I also read good things about the GVG but I cant afford to shell out for one!<br /><br />Freebase sandwiched between the herb of your choice. In my case, I have given up smoking hooch and am more interested in lengthening the DMT experience with other herbs which are more pleasant to smoke and more readily available and cheaper than hooch. There are a bunch of great herbs out there, each with their own note, flavour and some say plant-teacher within the herb.&nbsp; Personally I like using herbs which have an MAOI effect to lengthen and potentiate the trip.<br /><br />Herbs like passionflower, caapi, pau dárco, damiana, mullein etc. <br /><br />I LOVE CHANGA but I also really like the sandwich method. Itś foolproof and almost always guarantees a breakthrough hit in one lungful, so long as you BURN IT SLOWLY and allow the DMT to vapourise slowly rather than burn and taste disgusting. Ive never coughed or gagged on a bong-hit of DMT yet with this method and by fuck I have hit the edges of hyperspace.<br /><br />If you got any more questions man, feel free to PM me. I enjoy talking about this topic!<br /><br />Peace,<br />Diddle.

				Thanks for your post DiddleMT, +1. I m in research right now what to buy, a bulb pipe, a VG or a bong. People on dmt-nexus praise vapor genie but it&#039;s a bit expensive and I &#039;m not even talking about the glass. The easiest/cheapest is the bulb but a lot of people say it doesn&#039;t work very good.<br />So what do you recommend? <br />Also from your post I didn&#039;t really get it, what&#039;s your favourite method for changa? Can you smoke it efficiently with a joint?

				signing thread <br /><br />but I never tried DMT, I am scared as shit to try it. It reminds me to salvia. I bought some, some pure herb and some of the 10x salvia. The first time was ... mmmh strange .. just shifing away. Thought to my self, &quot;hhhm fuck it take a big big big head of it, and take the 10x concentrate...&quot; Damn this was not expected. I never was in such a state before. My room was different and I saw people not there and laughing at me... brrrr get a shiver just from thinking about. Salvia was the only drug I ever flushed.<br /><br />But DMT or changa.... mmmh maybe I try it but I am in no hurry here.=)<br /><br />take care<br />12345

Best way to smoke changa too as the amount you can fit into a cone is just enough of a dose to give you a great ride so theres less fiddling around, weighing up dosages or fucking around with sticky freebase! You can get a good amount of smoke in the chamber too before it hits your lungs and things start to get sideways, which is important if you wanna get a good seated position for lift-off!<br /><br />Plus, each type of herb can bring with it its own note, flavour and augment the experience in different ways. As with the sacred brew Ayahuasca, some herbs contain the Mono-Amine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) which is the part of the Aya brew which allows DMT to be taken orally; the part that lengthens and potentiates the trip. This is vital if you want to further explore the deeper realms of hyperspace and give it long enough to last and really enjoy your time in the outer dimensions.<br /><br />There are also pharmaceutical MAOIś such as Moclobemide. I just ordered some (legally) from a website goldpharma.com. Theyĺl ask you a bunch of medical history questions and write up a proper script and everything, its great! There are other websites but I chose that one based on where I live. I havent experimented with pharmahuasca yet but will be in the near future. I will likely just smoke freebase sandwiched between a nice herb like mullein (which is actually good on your lungs to smoke, used in treating TB etc!) with a bit of peppermint for flavour.<br /><br />So good luck man ;)<br /><br />@12345, Iḿ sorry to hear about your Salvia experience, it really does sound like you ODd a bit there but dont be discouraged; DMT is quite a bit different from Salvia. If you ever do pluck up the courage to get a few doses in the mail man I highly encourage you to give it a go. I think youll be pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Peace,<br />Diddle

People use ceramic screens or wire-scrubbers (the yanks call them chore boys) for the DMT to stick to but still, I think theyre fiddly, wasteful and frustrating! :P<br /><br />But worth a crack if only to learn!<br /><br />-Diddle

				<br />I&#039;ve made and used &quot;the machine&quot; and &quot;the key&quot;. Was not very good for me. Then I got a GVG and that did the trick. 30-50mg and breakthrough. I didn&#039;t know you could snort, you can IV it if its clean for guaranteed breakthrough.&nbsp; <br /><br />The protip that I have is its not the amount of hits but how long you hold in the first hit, then follow up with one more. You have to hold the first in literally forever, and take the next one within like 45 seconds. You&#039;ll be good. Do as much as you can within like 90seconds or a little more. Holding in the first for crazy long is the key. Condition your lungs a few times to stretch them out before hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get the dmt too hot and its gone.

				Best method I&#039;ve found is the wire scrubber in a bowl vaporizing. Torch the wire first to get rid of any coatings it has on it (hold it with pliers or something) then into the bowl with DMT on top.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m surprised I have never ever seen this mentioned here (prob missed it) but Illadelph makes a bowl designed for concentrates, liquids, powders etc. Essentially the holes are in the side rather than the bottom so it can hold liquid, a carefully monitored torch lighter at the right distance will vape otherwise they sell a glass rod as well for you to heat up the end then poke into it. <br />Clearnet random youtube link I found of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4QJ7LILIBE<br /><br />Honestly I found the DMT didn&#039;t vape very well with a lighter (other substances are fine) but I am keen to try putting a bit of wire scrubber in the bottom as it will conduct the heat better and hold the dmt at a high temp for a little longer. Haven&#039;t got around to testing yet, but might do in the next few days. I don&#039;t have the glass wand thing.

				My humble opinion is that glass equipment works pretty well, be it a bong or a pipe. The smoke of DMT is really harsh, so like others said, it would be nice if you could sort of &quot;sandwich&quot; it with some other blend or weed or what ever you would like. Have fun in hyperspace!&nbsp; ;)
