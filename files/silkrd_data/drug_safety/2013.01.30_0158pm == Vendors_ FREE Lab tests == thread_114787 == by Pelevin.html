				Send your product and I am gonna test it in a lab for you for free.<br /><br />Here is how:<br />Once received, the product will be tested withing a week. All results will be posted on Friday.<br />All substances, including research chemicals can be tested. (Over 150 substances). You can decide whether you want the results to be published here or forwarded privately to you.<br />The main purpose of the results is to test purity but the test will include warnings for cutting agents as well.<br />Pills will be taken pictures of and will be measured by size (all dimensions in 1/10 mm), also weight of all substances will be ranked and measured in 1/10 mg.<br />Powders will be tested for purity and cutting agents, results will be in percentage.<br /><br />NO Vendors with less than 15 transactions.<br /><br />The minimum amount requirements:<br /><br />- Pills: 1-2<br />- Powders: 100-150mg<br />- Research chemicals: 200-250mg (More than enough, but just to be sure).<br />- No liquid substances.<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to ask here on in private message.<br /><br />PS: Sorry for my bad English.

You doing this so you can do drugs you receive don&#039;t you ? And whats the point if vendor finds out he&#039;s selling shit quality and results aren&#039;t published ? delete this stupid topic and ask for vendors privately because no one cares here.
