				<br />If you inject tablets, you should be using a SYRINGE FILTER.&nbsp; Filtering thru cotton just isn&#039;t enough.<br />If you have seen that slightly cloudy stuff in your syringe before your injection, that stuff is going right into your body and it builds up in your liver and also your LUNGS.&nbsp; Some if it&#039;s talc, povidine, SILICA, etc.&nbsp; BAD STUFF.<br /><br />I would really like to find someone, or maybe a couple of people, who would go in with me on a few hundred sterile .2 micron syringe filters.&nbsp; &nbsp; I can get them for about a $1.25 each, and they are sterile, .2 micron, 13 mm diameter, and they make the solution come out CRYSTAL-CLEAR.<br />If you are interested in going in on some, send me an email and we&#039;ll talk about it.

				Good man. I don&#039;t inject anything, but I&#039;m willing to throw some money in if it means my fellow druggies will be a little safer.

				I&#039;ve never used one, but they&#039;re important if you shoot a lot of pills. I usually filter pills twice through cotton which isn&#039;t as good as a micron filter but it helps and the shots look almost clear. I&#039;m sure there are still plenty of small particles that I can&#039;t see that are slowly damaging my body.<br />Etizolam has 10 packs for sale at a reasonable price.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/15814
