You could sell it as MDMA, but if it&#039;s correct? No, not at all. Never, ever sell illicit substances as another product.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want people to die from an fatal combo because they thought 2c-b with MDMA would be okay when infact you send them 2c-t-7 instead of 2c-b. <br /><br />You never know what people are going to do, the least you can do is the supply them with a clean and pure product.

				I might be in the minority here but I feel like they are two completely different substances. Methylone has always been much more speedy for me, and it&#039;s very easy for me to tell the difference between M1 and MDMA. Granted, I have never done large doses of Methylone but at the dosages I stick to, they are very different.

				If OP didn&#039;t know the difference, I understand! And in fact you did the right thing that you asked here before you went on and sold a kilo of methylone as MDMA to a thousand people.&nbsp; <br />People buy MDMA to get the MDMA high right? They are expecting those &quot;good happy happy joy joy&quot; -vibes. Methylone is pretty much the same as MDMA, but much less effective. You will not experience the MDMA -high taking Methylone.<br /><br />Any self respecting human, won&#039;t knowingly sell methylone as MDMA.

				Exactly, to me it&#039;s missing the warm emotional blanket which turns into sloppy uncontrollable mashy bliss at its superb peak. I would never mislead anyone anyway, it&#039;s bad karma as far as I&#039;m concerned and if your product is good and pure, it usually sells itself.

				M1 (methylone) is always an easier come down for me and MDMA is much more addictive even towards the end of your trip.<br /><br />And hey! KID!!!! since youre new at this and haven&#039;t already read up... these drugs are both very bad for you if consumed in too high of a dose!!!<br />Be careful and read up on any and all drugs before you use them, smart thinkin asking here but theres a ton of info over on clearnet. <br /><br />Def DO NOT sell M1 as MDMA a simple reagant test will always help.

				You need to reagent test anything you plan on selling. If you started selling M1 as MDMA, you might not realize it&#039;s not MDMA, but your buyers sure as hell would. People on SR don&#039;t take too kindly to that. You&#039;d end up in pretty deep shit, pretty fast.

This leads to users needing more to reach the same level of fucked up so a dose of methylone releases more dopamine and less serotonin than an equivalent dose of MDMA leading to a more &quot;speedy&quot; and less &quot;loved-up&quot; feeling.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186541.msg1360364#msg1360364">Quote from: TLT13 on July 20, 2013, 12:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just saying &#039;bullshit&#039; doesn&#039;t really mean anything.

				If you want to sell methlyone as MDMA I say go right ahead just realize one or more of the things below will happen:<br /><br />One: You&#039;ll sell to someone who calls you out on your bullshit and then beats your ass. <br />Two: You&#039;ll make it all that more easier for real MDMA dealers to snag your customers as the real deal vs M1? Its like if Mike Tyson fought a 6 year old...in a wheel chair. <br />Three: You&#039;ll be responsible for a OD as someone will mix M1 in a manner it is not meant to be mixed. <br />Four: You&#039;ll turn people off from the amazing experience of a real roll, good job on damaging someone&#039;s thought train on a drug ya asshole! <br /><br />M1 sold as M1 is a good time, I know many people who like it more then MDMA as it is less intense but then again its just bad mojo to sell drug A as drug C. <br />

MDMA is like the night of your life, pure magic. Methylone isn&#039;t that at ALL (if you would take 200mg of both, to keep the doses the same). With MDMA you have this huge ball of energy and love inside of you. With methylone you feel &#039;good&#039; and you could even say euphoric, but you&#039;re not almost bursting out of your skin because you **HAVE** to make friends. The enhanced music and colors are sort of like MDMA. The physical effects are the same (tachycardia, dilation of pupils), but it&#039;s not MDMA. The peak isn&#039;t as explicit as with MDMA. MDMA = holy shit I&#039;m on top of the world and the world is love. Methylone = I feel good and happy.<br /><br />The first time I did MDMA it must&#039;ve been like 40-50mg.

If I take MDMA when just chilling out with friends, it makes me do and say dumb things and if I take methylone when dancing, it just doesn&#039;t give me enough energy and euphoria.<br />I don&#039;t consider methylone to be &quot;weak&quot; but I can see how MDMA is more &quot;magical&quot; but the next person might not find it &quot;magical&quot; at all. Both words are very elusive in this context and aren&#039;t useful when trying to describe the effects of a drug, especially of (bk-)MDMA, which can exhibit huge differences in effects in every individual.

Otherwise you&#039;d get similar &quot;magic&quot; from amphetamine and cocaine.<br />Also MDMA is anything but a weak dopamine releaser. It releases both serotonin and dopamine in large amounts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Sorry man, I think I confused the the dopamine thing with MDAI. However, ain&#039;t the amount of dopamine released by MDMA still relatively low when compared to basic amphetamine or meth?<br /><br />Now that I look at my post, I think that I shouldn&#039;t have commented on the effects in the way as if I&#039;d really know how methylone feels, as I have no experience from it. <br /><br />However, I still stand by my words on the &quot;magic&quot; -thing. MDMA&#039;s magic is caused by the blend of serotonin AND dopamine receptor activity. If you&#039;d take the dopamine factor out of MDMA, it wouldn&#039;t be the same MDMA experience and therefore one would not experience the same &quot;magic&quot;.<br /><br />MDAI is a good example of this. It is highly selective on serotonin and almost dead active on dopamine. Consuming MDAI won&#039;t give you the same magic as you get from the consumption from MDMA.<br /><br /><br />PS. good point about the subjective meaning of &quot;magic&quot;.

				well almost everything i had on my mind has been said at some point in this thread but i have a few opinions some people might find useful.<br /><br />bk-mdma can be used in a very different manner than mdma. i relate bk to cocaine more than i do to mdma. of course this is not based on the molecular structure.... its based on the effects of the drug.<br /><br />bk tends to call me back for more, much like cocaine. it also has a sort of emotional blankness to it compared to the psychedelic-ish empathy of actual mdma. its very talkative, and unless you take a high ass dose right in the very beginning, it is simply going to act like a euphoric stimulant and you will feel &quot;speedy&quot;<br /><br />like someone said earlier, mdma is an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you messy, or &quot;gonked&quot; as i like to say. <br /><br />bk seems to be much less heavy on my brain, which i appreciate. like stated before though it isnt an mdma replacement, it has its own way of getting you high.<br /><br />so for me, mdma has a more magical aspect to it... you begin to love and accept everything for what it is and it can be a life changing experience no doubt.<br /><br />bk, is an awesome booster for social interaction, and can make you feel pretty good, but the empathogenic effects are way less intense than mdmas.<br /><br /><br /><br />hopefully someone finds this useful lol&nbsp; :P<br /><br />PS: since we are here talking about empathogenic drugs, can we stop the conflicts?<br />things like mdma remind us that we are all brothers here!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />
