				It would be great if you did, cuz then I could compare your experience to mine and see if you use different methods.<br />Hopefully you&#039;ll be able to break through!<br /><br />Here is a report of my attempt...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=170169.msg1284041#msg1284041">Quote from: zipstyle on June 28, 2013, 02:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am back with my First Trial Report:<br /><br />Earlier this week, I got a 250 mg sample from JeffBobb (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b837eeb5d4) for his N,N DMT crystalline powder. The package arrived quickly, and the stealth was legit. If you are considering DMT vendors, I would highly recommend this one for the spice. I can say, after my First Trial, that this is very potent and also very close to pure (I have used DMT on several other occasions from a variety of sources).<br /><br />I decided to start with basics, since there is such little information on the internet (darknet or clearnet) about rectal administration of DMT.<br /><br />I put somewhere between 15-20 mg of DMT powder into a small bottle cap and added 1.5 ml of water.<br />DMT did not fully dissolve, but it did go into suspension so that I could draw it all up into a liquid syringe (used for infant medication admin.)<br />I put the syringe pretty far into my anus and delivered the DMT.<br />Then I laid down on my stomach for approximately 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, I felt tingling spreading from my anus out to my lower body and also up towards my torso. You know, the kind of tingling usually accompanied by goosebumps. While this was happening, I was also experiencing a growing burning feeling in my anus. Also a very strong urge to defecate, even though I&#039;d already emptied my bowels before starting the experiment. After 5 minutes, I couldn&#039;t wait anymore. The urge to poop and the burning had become basically unbearable. <br />After expelling whatever else my body was able to push out, I sighed, thinking the experiment was over and that I&#039;d need to do another trial. But suddenly, I felt that familiar feeling in my teeth that I get when I do DMT (I don&#039;t know if other people get this or not). It&#039;s the sensation that my teeth are vibrating at a specific frequency or something, and then that feeling kind of spreads to the rest of my body. Either way, I realized the experiment was not over YET. :)<br />So I wiped my ass (which was feeling considerably better after) and laid back down on my bed.<br />The DMT comeup feeling continued to grow for about 2-3 minutes. <br />With my eyes closed, I noticed that the darkness behind my eyelids was growing steadily brighter (and my room was mostly dark). I could almost feel the DMT moving through my veins and into my brain like small waves on the beach as the tide is going up. That steady, rhythmic increasing. However, this feeling faded after about 4 minutes and I was left with a peaceful mindstate.<br />End Report<br />~.~.~<br /><br />Thoughts: I think I need to increase the dose to somewhere between 30-50 mg and possibly use a different substance to dissolve the DMT in. I&#039;m guessing butter was suggested because DMT dissolves easily in butter? Will have to research that property a bit more. I can say that rectal administration is most definitely a reasonable ROA, but the technique needs to be fine-tuned. I&#039;m glad I tried this before snorting it, that&#039;s for sure. I really enjoyed the gradual comeup vs the usual shot-out-of-a-psychedelic-cannon feeling one gets from smoking the DMT. I think this will be my ROA of choice once I understand what I need in order to achieve a breakthrough dose. This ROA didn&#039;t lose any of the feelings of sanctity that smoked DMT affords. I felt like I was on my way to be in a very &quot;holy&quot; kind of state and that I would be in touch with Teachers soon. <br /><br />As a (funny) side note: I think I may have at least successfully micro-dosed DMT! :P <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyways, I think the biggest issue is getting the DMT to dissolve in the water and getting it all to stay in the ass...the burning and the feeling that you&#039;re about to shit yourself is pretty overwhelming and uncomfortable, tbh. <br /><br />Lemme know if you figure out any tricks for overcoming these obstacles. My next trial will be done with a frozen pellet of butter that has ~50 mg DMT in it. Hopefully that will help the DMT absorb better, reduce burning, and make it a better experience overall. <br /><br />Anyways, do it! For science, at least.

				I tried dissolving DMT in water and plugging the water last night.&nbsp; Only 5-10mg.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t get it to fully dissolve there were a couple of small pieces left in the water.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t get any noticeable effect.&nbsp; Maybe just an insufficient dose.&nbsp; Better safe than sorry though especially since I don&#039;t have any experience with DMT.

				DMT freebase won&#039;t dissolve in water that easy. The fumarate salt of DMT on the other hand, does dissolve very good. There are a few teks out there that describe the extraction of DMT straight to the salt. <br /><br />IIRC, in order to use other administration routes for DMT, one needs a MAOi. DMT is being metabolized very fast and slow onset doesn&#039;t work. Smoking, IV or IM are the routes without a MAOi. <br /><br />For oral, rectal and all other sorts of administration, a MAOi is required to prevent DMT being attacked by this enzyme. The MAOi will inhibit the function of the enzyme so it can&#039;t metabolize DMT.<br /><br />When taking MAOí, caution must be used. Read up on varies MAOi&#039;s and don&#039;t be stupid.<br /><br />

				rectal administration avoids first-pass metabolism through the liver so I wouldn&#039;t think it would require an MAO-I.&nbsp; In any case there is a lot of experience out there with vaping DMT and that seems to be the way to go so I&#039;ll focus on that.

You can use vinegar that transforms the DMT freebase into DMT acetate (salt) and it dissolves easily in water, for example. For plugging is fine, for injection there will be still plant materials in the possible extraction to take in consideration.<br /><br />And no, for rectal administration you don&#039;t need a MAOI.<br /><br />EDIT: Moreover for plugging you need an higher dose than with smoking, on par with a snorting dose, but the effects last (much) more than smoking. Even if you did dissolve the DMT correctly in water with only 10 mg you would have not even reached considerable threshold effects. I think the minimum you should try is about 20 mg.

I divided into two lines and ripped one into each nostril. It burned like motherfucker! And five minutes later when the pain went down to the bearable level still no CEVs. Only the feeling that I had done something really stupid and dangerous. <br /><br />Just last night I tried shooting 20mg of 2CE up my ass with a plastic syringe that has a long curved &quot;beak&quot;. It&#039;s the perfect tool for delivering up there past the asshole&#039;s nerves. Still, you really do get the urge to take an immediate crap and though I guess you can fight the urge it makes you so uncomfortable you&#039;re not going to be able to enjoy the ride anyway.

He told me that one form of dmt you can snort and the other is not bioavalible. I don&#039;t exacly know what he was talking about but mayby we had different types because I did it 3 times. Once at 75 which produced little visuals and two at about 100-120 I had cevs for about 20 mins and had complete euphoria for one hour. I only have 50 mgs ofthis dmt left and iI&#039;ve been saving it to smoke on a special occasion. My friend also had the same experiences that work.
