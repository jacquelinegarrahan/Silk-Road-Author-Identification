				So something i&#039;ve always wondered... and maybe its just me... but why do Oxy 40&#039;s suck balls ?<br />They seem to barely have anything in them... and grr so damn small. <br /><br />I like to snort them up... and it seems like having 2x 20&#039;s is way better than having 1x40... ?<br /><br />Same with the 80&#039;s.. They arent as bad as the 40&#039;s... but it just seems like having 4x20 is better than than 1x80 ?<br /><br />I usually have small lines over a few hours, but just seems like if I have small lines of 20&#039;s (but a few 20&#039;s) it has way more an effect than a few lines of 40 or 80&#039;s.... Is there some trick I am missing... I am familiar with how to snort.. so that part is correct hehe..<br /><br />anyways yeah.. always been curious about that... <br /><br />?

				Florida isn&#039;t nearly as crazy as it was a few years ago...a lot of the pill mills have dried up.&nbsp; all throughout the south, the pills have become harder to find, and it seems like the heroin has moved in with a vengeance to take their place.
