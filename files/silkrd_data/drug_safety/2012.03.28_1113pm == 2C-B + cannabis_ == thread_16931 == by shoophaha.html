				Title: <strong>2C-B + cannabis?</strong><br />

				I usually like to toke with my psychedelics (shrooms and LSD) as I find that it greatly enhances the experience. I just ordered some of foxymeow&#039;s smarties today and was hoping to do a couple of them at a party (that would be 16 mg). I&#039;d like to be lucid and comfortable in a party environment, but I fucking love visuals and I was wondering if you all would recommend some weed with my 2C-B. For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;d be using a MFLB vape instead of smoking.

				2C-B was so overwhelmingly pleasurable for me that I got stupid just from being on 2C-B when I went to a party. Smoking might make you a little too widdly.<br /><br />Try 2C-B by itself first, then try it with cannabis. :)

				Good point! I remember being underwhelmed by the acid until I smoked which is why I was wondering but since the Smarties come in packs of 10 I have multiple tries! :D

				I would smoke after you peak because if you were to smoke before your peak the cannabis would just grab the 2c-b and fly with it and a lot of people can&#039;t handle that.

				If&nbsp; I were going to a party I would drink just enough to get a little bit tipsy and then ingest around 20mg 2C-B orally.

				Personally I love smoking a joint while on 2cb. It really ramps up the visuals for me, and can affect the time dilation / unique experience of music you get with the drug.
