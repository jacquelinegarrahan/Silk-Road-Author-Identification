				Hey sorry if someone posted this before - But i seem to have an issue with sleeping lately and it bothers me like hell.<br /><br />So like recently i dosed twice a week (probably 40/50 each) and i can sleep.. but hardly! I would not consider myself to be an insomniac, as I can usually fall asleep within an hour or so but now I&#039;m just half awake laying in bed and my thoughts are completely random and this is going for about a week or so.. Any relevant information on the subject would be appreciated!

				Has there been anything stressful going on in your life around the time you dosed the DMT?&nbsp; Would you also mind describing the nature of those last two trips?

				I always fall asleep like a baby after a DMT trip.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been trying to cut back on my cannabis use and that has really fucked up my sleeping pattern.<br /><br />Have you stopped smoking weed lately?

The DMT &quot;trip&quot; is very similar to what happens in the heavier phase of REM sleep and so DMT can actually influence that phase during sleep cycles. If it depends on the pharmacology or on what happens during the experience (or a mix of the two) it is unknown to me at this moment, what I know is that it can happen, especially (as I said) during intensive use. The same thing happens, btw, when you practice meditative states and you reach certain levels.<br /><br />If you are bugged by it I suggest you to simply stop the use of DMT for some time, after about 10 days everything should return to perfectly normal. This or you hold on and it will pass by itself but it is a hard step to pass and I don&#039;t suggest it if you don&#039;t know what you are doing.
