				i&#039;m sure most will say IVing is the way to go, how does this compare to chasing the dragon (smoking) or insufflating (snorting) it.

				If you don&#039;t plan on IVing just snort it, smoking tends to waste.<br /><br />I personally never have shot up the stuff, but i&#039;d assume it would feel a hundred times better doing so.

				I&#039;m too much of a chicken to try to IV anything (yet), but my friend watered a bit of tar down and had me snort it and it was very effective. Don&#039;t smoke it, it&#039;s a waste. :(

				why does everyone reckon smoking a waste,if u new to it maybe but i dont lose any smoke ,when smoking it its not just about getting fuked its like a ritual having the foil in your hand and running lines ,it gives u something to do for&nbsp; hours rather than 2 seconds for sniff and shoot.in uk i dont no any one ever who sniffs h and nearly all shooters i know are back smoking ,its best way by far i think it tastes nice and nothing better than having a toot<br />&nbsp;and u dont have to stick pins in your neck and shit ,i hate sniffing anything but wouldnt do it aanyway ,tooting only for me waking up with beatle stuck to my head and shit feel wide awake&nbsp; and then another line and your gone again&nbsp; ahh carnt wait <br /><br />im on about no3 though never had 4 <br />iv will be stronger though but im not starting now after years ov not . i see how fuked up all my mates legs etc are and watching em shoot in there necks its fukin sick as fuck

				Iving is for sure the way to go.<br /><br />I first started by smoking it. It was Nuc&#039;s china white...stupid stupid. But I con&#039;t to smoke cause I still got fucked up and feeling amazing from smoking #4. So I got some tar from Johnnydepp2012. It was FIRE. I also had Psi&#039;s #3 and the tar imo was stronger but doesn&#039;t last as long. I also snorted Psi&#039;s stuff so It would last longer and make the &quot;rush&quot; better when smoking. It was very cool getting very relaxed and high but Nothing like what people said when IV&#039;d.<br /><br />I always had good veins to IV so I was like let&#039;s buy 100 syringes and see how it goes. Well it WENT FUCKING GREAT.<br /><br />I had 27g Easy Touches(28&#039;s though are the best, I just got them today and the needle size is perfect and way smaller than 27. But I guess I should try the 29 easy touches to see if they work well. Because SureComfort SYRINGES SUCK(IMO)!!!<br /><br />But yeah, IV will give you the best feeling you ever will have. I&#039;ve done psychedelics(and still do) and this is like the peak euphoria wise but not visual wise lol. Idk, Iving shows you everything but IV is a waste of substance. 40-60% is alot when looking at the snorting/smoking stats.<br /><br />Iving is obviously 100%. There is no pain when you stick the needle in either. If you just con&#039;t to go at that angle it will go through so easy and painless. Cause I was slightly scared in the beginning too because sometimes there is some pain but nothing compared to getting stabbed by a sharp pencil(that shit hurts, fucking gangsters)<br /><br />But after 10 times you get the hang of it and you start to love the whole ritual about it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t tell anyone to do it. It&#039;s their choice. But it&#039;s the best way and if you can moderate(or go crazy on it) your soul will thank you when you die LoL.<br /><br />Oh I hope I get Fanny hills H tomorrow. It said it left a area 5 hours away so it should be here today(sat). It&#039;s express too so it has to get here today. I want some #4 so bad! THe rush of #4 and bomb tar is so different, I love to switch off every week haha. <br /><br />Life is good :) <br /><br />But it&#039;s a bitch.&nbsp; ::)

				For a newbie smoking or snorting it is going to be the way to go. Obviously, eventually you&#039;ll probably want to graduate to spiking it, but honestly try not to get to that point if you can help it. The needle is a one way street, and once you go down it, you can never go back (at least 99% of people never do, including myself). The kind of H you get determines whether smoking or snorting is better. If you are getting tar, smoke it all the way -- not only is chasing the dragon on a piece of foil sort of an addicting little game, but tar has a strong strong taste, and dissolving it in water to shoot up your nose can be pretty gross (it&#039;ll still get you quite a nice high though). The other type&#039;s I do not have nearly as much experience with, but like ECP I have never heard of people smoking, only snorting and shooting. You gotta remember man, heroin is a needle drug. Snorting and smoking is for first timers who are scared of syringes, you can continue doing it that way if you like (and you should because IVing it will lead you down an awful, awful road) but ultimately it is a meant to be experienced shot into a vein. Just don&#039;t be surprised if you find yourself living under and overpass a year from now, not saying it to be mean but shooting H generally destroys people&#039;s lives quite quickly, it will become your master and once you get really sick you will do WHATEVER you need to in order to get well. Eh, I guess I&#039;ve said my bit -- good luck and be safe man, please!

				It really depends on your source which ROA is going to be most effective. I would probably recommend that you ask your dealer what that specific batch of H is best for. I haven&#039;t graduated to IVing yet, and I honestly don&#039;t really see myself doing that at any point, but I did test out four different batches smoked, insufflated, and orally. Two of them I preferred smoking by far, and the other two I preferred snorting by far. Not surprisingly, I didn&#039;t really enjoy oral administration that much. I really think it&#039;s gonna depend, though.
