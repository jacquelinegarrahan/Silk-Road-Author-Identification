				Hey, I&#039;ve had ketamine a few times now. The first few times we&#039;re great.. I had some pretty intense but beautiful closed eye visuals, and the experience taught me a lot about myself and my current situation. It&#039;s hard to describe, but I had so many questions that within the midst of this intense psychedelic (I&#039;m not sure if I K-holed snorting, but it was like nothing I&#039;ve experienced before) - and I found a lot of answers. Afterwards I felt so serene and the only thing I could think of was it was a beautiful / amazing experience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had approx 5 and 1/2 grams over the past month (and pretty much ever, save a gram or so many years ago), so nothing too indulgent - though in the middle I did 2 and 1/2 grams in a 24 hour period which to me felt a bit borderline abuse.<br /><br />Fast forward to the latest gram I had under a week ago. I was in the same location, listening to the same music and either I had a major sense of deja vu or the visuals were *precisely* the same for each song I listened I too..? Was a bit of a strange experience. The problem I had though was in the midst of the visuals I noticed (not sure if it happened last time) that my mouth and tongue were extremely numb. I started having looping-type thoughts an imagery of accidentally biting off my tongue and either swallowing or choking on it..? <br /><br />So I have a couple of questions again:<br /><br />1) Are feelings of deja vu common at higher doses of Ketamine? Or is it possible the combination of same location / same songs lead me to the exact same visuals as previous times?<br /><br />2) Are there any reports of people biting or choking on their tongue whilst it&#039;s numb when on Ketamine, or was my anxiety completely unfounded?<br /><br />I really want to buy and enjoy some more, but I feel a little put off from the last experience. Any information appreciated!

				Once I got a batch of &#039;ketamine&#039; that produced extremely mild psychedelic effects, and that was impossible to k hole on. The most pronounced effect was a total numbing of my tongue and throat. It was not very pleasant. I complained to the vendor, who is a friend of mine, and he said that he actually had been scammed on a kilo of ketamine and it was some other drug related to ketamine but not actually ketamine. I want to say norketamine but I cannot remember with certainty what it was called. Anyway he refunded me and eventually gave me some real ketamine. Hearing your report of throat and tongue numbing reminded me of that, but it seems that you got decent psychedelic effects still. When I got that bunk ketamine it was like 98% numbness 2% trippy.

				Good S Isomer K, can have such an array of effects as far as your experience goes. Almost no 2 trips will be exactly alike. <br /><br />Yes i notice dejavu is quite common. As for the numbing, its more than common. I have never heard of any one fucking up their tongue on it or choking on it either.

				Note that the racemic variant of K will produce more of a numbing/dis coordinated type effect, where as the S isomer is the trippy, good shit.

				I&#039;ve had numerous occasions on K where I&#039;ve wondered whether I was dead, at the moment of death, in a coma, missing limbs, et cetera. But no tongue biting. Luckily the K affords a certain amount of detachment to the point that sometimes I can be certain of my impending doom yet still have little concern for or at least acceptance of death. Definitely nothing like DMT or other psychedelics with which such an experience can be downright terrifying. That&#039;s interesting you mention the synchronous music while under the influence. That&#039;s one of the best parts! K trips play along perfectly with music. It&#039;s pretty rad doing it with someone else so you can have shared hallucinations. It can be pretty intense watching movies on K as well. Sometimes I get so immersed in the action that I feel like I&#039;m interacting with the scene/characters and totally forget that it&#039;s simply a film.<br /><br />K can be great with nitrous as well. Nitrous on it&#039;s own can be kind of meh, but a lung full of nitrous on K will totally blast you off. MDMA/molly is absolutely serene with K as well, and makes for a much more sociable, long-lasting experience. K/MDMA can make for the craziest sex ever, though you&#039;ll almost certainly need Viagra/Cialis and a partner who is equally as fucked up. It&#039;s totally and indescribably intense.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done all sorts of K over the years but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever experienced a (noteworthy) numb mouth or tongue. Certainly the drip will burn and numb whatever it touches. Generally I just end up with numb/burning nostrils and sometimes a dull aching headache or sinuses. If you do K frequently enough however, it will damage your bladder and you will have have pains in your torso.<br /><br />The mind-loop (common to other psychedelics) and numb mouth/tongue doesn&#039;t really sound like K, but everything else you&#039;ve described is very common. I&#039;ve found the S isomer to be great for introspection, but everyone has different preferences. The S isomer also tends to clear out of your system very quickly without residual effects. I won&#039;t even do racemic K anymore because of the lingering effects, hangover, lasting uncoordination, etc.

				Lots of great information I can relate to here, thanks!<br /><br />The Ketamine: I ordered from the top domestic Ketamine vendor whom I&#039;ve dealt with previously. He did however mention on his profile page he had a new batch of Ketamine so I&#039;m not sure?<br /><br />The Numbing: I don&#039;t recall the numbing on previous occasions, which might be directly related to the above new batch. <br /><br />The Experience: I can relate completely with the &#039;impending doom yet still have little concern&#039; - on previous occasions at least. I had thoughts I can only describe as &#039;panicky&#039; but I didn&#039;t feel any of the associated anxiety with the thoughts - I honestly couldn&#039;t care about it. <br /><br />The Combinations: I did Ketamine with MDMA on one occasion, it was an excellent experience. Had a pretty psychedelic experience smoking a few joints with Ketamine too. I&#039;m yet to try any other combinations but may get some S-ISOMER next time (which I&#039;ve tried before from another vendor) and see how it goes.<br /><br />The Music and TV: 95% of my Ketamine experiences have been with music. It&#039;s brilliant and the journey with certain albums (Spiritualised - Lazer Guided Melodies is my favourite for e.g.) can be quite profound. I&#039;m currently re-watching all the seasons of 24 (just to pass the time haha) and watched some on Ketamine. Faces seemed slightly distorted resembling aliens, making it feel more like a Sci-Fi Action series than the regular Action cheese it is!<br /><br />Typing and thinking about all this has really made me want some S-ISOMER, I think I&#039;ll go ahead and order some.<br /><br />Thank you for an interesting read and putting my mind at ease.

				Hey bro, the numbing is very common, with S isomer, usally. <br /><br />I find that once i did a good amount, it seems the whole top half of my head gets real numb, like from the roof of my mouth up. Some times my throat a bit. Its nothing to worry about. You wont bite your tongue, or swallow it lol.
