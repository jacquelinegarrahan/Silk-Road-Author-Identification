				I did it a while ago, I just googled it (how to cook crack) from what I remember 1 gram of coke in a large spoon with water, add about 2points of bi-carb soda heat up with a lighter, it will fizz up and remove the unwanted crap to the top of the spoon, the coke will start to form a ball at the bottom of the spoon (you only want to simmer this not boil the crap out of it) once the coke has formed a solid ball it can be removed it is now crack, but also after this if you really want to remove any small crap that might be in the crack, crush it down or use a razor blade to make it into a powder then tip the powder into a glass of water(don&#039;t worry it won&#039;t dissolve) stir it then tip the water through a paper coffee filter you then have crack powder in the coffee filter which will be a super clean smoke. This is what I remember it would be best to google it. I&#039;m surprised no-one else has responded to this. When I cooked it 1 gram of coke turned into 1/2gram crack

				Just a spoon with ammonia.<br />put your coke in the ammonia.<br />Heat the spoon and melt he coke.<br />Dip a tip of a knife (or so) in the molten coke.<br />When dip in and out again and again, slowly!, you will see the ball form on the tip of the knife because of the crystallization of the coke.<br />Ammonia is the opposite of acid.<br />So now you have the free base of coke , the crack.<br />You can chose to coock the coke again in water for it is now the free base the coke will not dissolve in the water anymore.<br />The raw coke does disappear/dissolves in water.<br />When you have a few grams, you can take a pan and a little water and dissolve the coke by heating up the water.<br />&nbsp;The coke will disappear !!!<br />Don&#039;t worry, when a lot of ammonia is added, the coke will not be able to be dissolved in the water anymore and will appear again.<br />Like a drop of oil you will see the coke come floating to the surface again.<br />The same way as i described before.<br />Dip in and out and let the crack crystallize on the tip of the knife.<br />You can also stir the coke a little bit around in the spoon itself.<br />The coke will crystallize that way too.<br />Separate the coke (the crack) from the ammonia.<br /><br />Take a mirror or a piece of glass or something, anything with a very smooth surface.<br />Squeeze the coke from the tip of the knife on the mirror and start to press it on the surface and start wiping like you are putting butter on your bread.<br />Keep wiping until it&#039;s dry.<br />The better the coke is, the sooner it will dry.<br /><br />take a razor-blade for the fine final cut,<br />now you have the free base ready to smoke.<br /><br />It&#039;s not suitable for snoring anymore.<br />It (the crack) will not melt in your lungs and nose.<br /><br />Try a little bit at first.<br />To make the first hit from your pipe, right away a so called &quot;&quot;good one&quot;&quot; is dangerous.<br />See how the quality is and wait a few minutes to be sure.<br />A overdose is often the result of misjudging the quality.<br />

				why dont you try to cook it up yourself, its really easy to do, although i would recommend you use ammonia as the taste and overall quality is far better than using baking soda, and you need to get real good quality coke, there are a few i could recommend as i cook all the coke i get and ive bought from most sellers on sr

				It seems cheaper to buy the crack already cooked as its already done and sometimes you never know how much weight you will lose if you cook it yourself. Does anyone know anything about the seller Kalonji seems to have more sales than feedback that he is showing?
