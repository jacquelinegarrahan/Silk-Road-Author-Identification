				So I am not an expert on opiates but I have heard that heroin is just morphine cut with something.&nbsp; If this is the case does that mean if I had morphine sulfate tablets they would be equivalent to 100 percent pure heroin?

				No No No. Heroin is Diacetylmorphine.<br /><br />The process to convert morphine to heroin is such<br /><br />&quot;upplies:<br />* Mineral spirits or varsol<br />* Toluene or Chloroform<br />* Concentrated Ammonia or some other base<br />* Muriatic Acid or some other acid<br />* Pyrex bowl<br />* Porcelain bowl<br />* 60 mL gardening syringe<br />* Glasses<br />* Graduated measuring cup<br />* Paper coffee filters<br />* hydrion pH papers<br />* Heat source - If you want to do it professionally, then use a labratory heating element device listed in the elemental scientific catalogue. Right next to the magnetic stirring devices, which you might want as well. both items will cost you a total of $300. Otherwise this works as well -(outside with one of those camping stoves with an electric element would be the best, But if you must do it indoors and use your oven you better turn on the over head fan and pull a stool up next to your stove and be ready with the lid to the bowl just incase it flashes.)<br /><br />All of this stuff can be bought at hardware and gardening stores but if you can&#039;t manage to find Toluene because youre from the USA buy it from [Edit: a place]. Muriatic would be the best but if you cant get it other stuff like citric or acetic will work too. The preferred base would be concentrated Ammonia but if you cant get that household ammonia will work, Caustic lime or soda or potash will also work.<br /><br />1- Remove the pill coating from your 20 pills with a piece of tissue paper dampened with acetone, if you dont have acetone laying around your crib just use water.<br /><br />2-Crush up your 20 pills with shells removed and then place the powder in the pyrex casserole bowl. Make up a 50 mL solution of distilled water that is slighly acidic around pH 5 or 6. Add the Acidic Water to the powder and let them soak with no heat.<br /><br />3-Make up a solution (150 mL) of 80% mineral spirits and 20% toluene or the substitutions of the two. Add this solution to the Acidic water and stir vigirously for a few minutes.<br />Not your usual food in this oven today!<br /><br />4-Be precise - use a themometer to moniter the inside temps. The temps stated on the dial do not heat the oven to the temperature listen on the dial. Turn the stove up to about 50 degrees celcius and leave it for ten minutes now turn it up to 80 degrees celcius and leave it for an additional 10 or fifteen minuites. During this time period stir the solution ever few minutes. Now tilt the bowl up and suck up with your syringe the entire 50 mL water solution (which is the bottom layer) and even 10 ml (in a seperate action) of the Nonpolar layer. Squirt out the Water layer into a clean pocelain bowl that can be heated on the stove, MAKE SURE you dont get any of the non polar into it.<br /><br />5-Add an additional 50 mL of acidic water to the pyrex bowl and do exactly the same thing as you did with the previous 50 mL. You&#039;re done with the non polar so you can put it away. Once you have the 100 mL of the morphine/water solution in the porcelain bowl put it on the stove and heat to 90 degrees celcius for 5 minutes. (Around halfway between low and the next notch up before medium on your stove) You should really use a labratory heating element. Now while its still piping hot pour it into a clean glass and funnel cup with cotton stuffed in the spout of the funnel. Pour in an extra 5 ml through the funnel to get an morphine thats trapped.<br /><br />6- Add Ammonia to the solution drop by drop until you hit a pH of 9.1. One you hit the 9.1 put the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes stir it up then put it in the refridgerator for another 15 minutes. now pour the stuff into a funnel with 3 coffe filters in it, make sure to wet the filters with cold water before you pour in the mix. Once its filtered you will get the morphine freebase, if you wanna inject it as it is just mix it with some vinegar or dry it out and cook it with Acetic anhydride. Edit: [This is not a good idea! Injecting an unknown quantity of acid, probably fairly concentrated, is a very bad idea! robo] So theres a walkthrough step by step, its not so bad, plus its better than wasting dope by trying to make it injectable with just water. Once you have this base cooking up heroin is even easier than this extraction. BTW this extraction on average yields about 95 percent of the total morphine from the pills.<br /><br />For the heroin conversion you have to get morphine freebase. If you have morphine in a salt form (morphine sulpahte) just simply add enough water to your Morphine salt for it all to dissolve, then add Ammonia drop by drop until you get around pH of 9. Once you hit that ph just throw the solution in the refrigerator for awhile and then filter, once filtered you can clean it of any traces of the salt by spraying it with small portions of clean water.<br /><br />Now, Converting your Morphine into street quality Heroin (diacetylmorphine)<br /><br />Procedure:<br />First, place some of your converted morphine into a metal spoon and add 2 X the weight acetic anhydride (so 1 gram of M to 2 grams of AA) and then cover with a piece of aluminum foil and bake in the oven at around 100 degrees Celsius, for at least 1 hour (preferrably 6). Then uncover and turn the oven off. Either let the AA evaporate by itself Edit [Not likely, it will pull water out of the air and make glacial acetic acid], or you can place the spoon on the heating element (burner) on your stove 2 distill off the AA, it boils at 140 degrees C, if you do that make sure you leave a little bit of AA in the spoon and let that little bit evaporate at room temp, cause you dont want to burn the heroin. Then place the remaining substance in the refrigerator. When the substance is cold, you can move it to a burner (torch lighter) and just heat till you think its at about at least 80 degree&#039;s and sniff a couple inches above it. It shouldnt sting your nose, if it does just heat it lightly some more until the smell goes away. Then scrape the hard, dry heroin off the spoon with another spoon, and place it under a one dollar bill. Then using your lighter rub back and forth over the dollar bill, and crush your brittle heroin.Voila! Now the final product is street quality heroin. Ready to either be taken or sold.<br /><br />1- Heroin baking in the oven<br />2- Heroin placed on the stovetop after baking<br />3- Heroin placed on the stove element set at (around medium low, to low)<br />4- Heroin almost done roughly two minutes left<br /><br />Hold the dollar bill to the surface with your left hand, and rub the lighter against the bill with your right hand. You need to do this in order to crush the Heroin into injectable powder.&quot;<br /><br />From bluelight...

				Heroin is diacetyl-morphine. Pure heroin only has a stronger rush because the acetyl groups make it go to the brain faster where it metabolizes into morphine. The high after the rush is exactly the same as morphine if you take pure heroin, but street heroin has other active molecules in it which makes it feel different, especially for the dirtier heroin like black tar. <br />Pure heroin is also more potent than morphine but those are the only two differences.

				^^ Black tar heroin also has 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), and 3-MAM (3-monoacetylmorphine). 6-MAM is a natural neurotransmittor found in the brain in very small amounts and acts as an endogenous mu-opioid agonist. 6-MAM is considered somewhat more potent than diacetylmorphine which is one reason why some users actually prefer black tar. While tar is usually less pure, it is sometimes more potent because of these other opiates. It is the only form of heroin I ever tried (and only once). Although all this talk of opiates is kinda making me want some, its been so long

				Well the 6-MAM and 3-MAM (inactive) isn&#039;t only what makes it different, it&#039;s more the narcotine and other opium alkaloids not present in pure heroin I&#039;d say, because black tar is basically opium + glacial acetic acid right? There isn&#039;t any real extraction unlike the Asian heroin that&#039;s pretty heavily refined. 6-MAM shouldn&#039;t feel any different than pure heroin because heroin&#039;s metabolism goes like heroin -&gt; 6-MAM -&gt; morphine. In both cases, morphine is the end product. Maybe the initial feeling is different though since 6-MAM is active in itself.

				All the sources I can find claim 6-MAM is more potent than diacetylmorphine, also it doesnt simply metabolize into morphine (at least not all of it) because they test for it specifically to see if you have used heroin in the last 24 hours. 6-MAM isnt merely a product of heroin metabolism either, its actually present in its current state in samples of black tar. There are other opiate alkaloids left over from the extraction. I don&#039;t really know much about narcotine, I&#039;m going to go look into it now.

				Yeah I know it&#039;s not just a product of metabolism in black tar, but it&#039;s because their esterification reaction isn&#039;t total, they use GAA instead of acetic anhydride so that&#039;s why. I was just saying that since diamorphine metabolizes into 6-MAM pretty quickly, 6-MAM shouldn&#039;t feel much different than diamorphine but I&#039;m really not sure.<br />Narcotine is said to be hallucinogenic at high doses. I&#039;ve had the chance to try pure narcotine pills and its effects are really different from other opiates. It was mostly antidepressant at the dose I took but I didn&#039;t have so much.. I think it&#039;s narcotine that makes BTH more dreamy than #4 heroin according to experienced users. There&#039;s also thebaine, which is what makes poppy tea stimulating, that should contribute to the differences.

Obviously the yields for such an approach are much lower, but this is how much of the worlds heroin in actually produced back in the asian jungles. <br /><br />Obviously it could be done much more efficiently using proper equipment and procedures, but i doubt that process would be economical in the western world. Pure morphine is expensive enough compared to heroin to make the whole ordeal a money-wasting process that yields you a drug that is more dangerous and less pleasant than the one you began with.

If you have pure morphine and good glassware I&#039;d go with making hydromorphone though, which is 5 times as potent as morphine and not harder to make than heroin. Reflux morphine in absolute ethanol with a palladium or platinum catalyst and that&#039;s it. That would be pretty profitable I think..

				That may actually be viable since it also caters to a more high end market that is willing to pay top dollar for quality, clean products.<br /><br />As a chemist i&#039;d say that the conversion reactions of morphine to heroin would not be difficult to perform at all. From a business standpoint it would, however, make no sense to convert clean morphine into heroin that has to compete with a street quality contaminated product. I don&#039;t want to stereotype here, but the average heroin client is someone that needs a fix and at that point cares little about purity or safety. <br /><br />You get a similar thing thing crack, where the reaction from cocaine is entirely feasible, but not economically viable since very pure cocaine is so expensive that the end product will not have a competitive market price after you&#039;re done. <br /><br />Hydromorphone from morphine could be viable process, and given its relative easy probably a profitable one for someone that is handy with glasswork and can source pure morphine. <br /><br />I suppose a more profitable synthesis is that of fentanyl, but is hardly as simple as heroin or crack.

				i was under the impression that u need acetic anhydride to convert morphine to heroin!!!<br />so far none of the chemicals listed here would do anything!&nbsp; &nbsp;being that none of them are catalysts <br /><br />they might purify morphine but that will do nothing to making into heroin??<br /><br />plz set me straight if i am wrong

				You are not wrong, to go from freebase morphine to heroin the only reaction required is that with acetatic anhydride, or acetic acid under the right conditions This step could also be carried out with other ethylating agents, perhaps even alcohol.<br /><br />Several processes exist that yield heroin as the end product. If you got pure morphine as the starting ingredient a reaction with a strong base like calcium hydroxie folllowed by ammoniumchloride treatment to obtain the free base product would best. This can then be condensated to yield heroin by reaction with glacial acetic acid.<br /><br />A nice and clean reaction like that is what you would do if someone asked you to convert a kilo of pure morphine into heroin. <br /><br />In reality, the starting product is not clean morphine though, but a mess of ground opium poppy heads with all kinds of contaminants in them, and you&#039;d be on your own trying to make somehting usable of that in a remote jungle. <br /><br /><br /><br />
