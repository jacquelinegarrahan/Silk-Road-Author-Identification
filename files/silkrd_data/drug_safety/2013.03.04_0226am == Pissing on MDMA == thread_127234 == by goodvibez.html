				So I looked this up a little bit on google which took me mainly to bluelight and a couple other forums but this is the only forum that I have an account with and I&#039;m curious as to who all has experienced this same problem, also would be sweet to hear a detailed explanation as to why this happens if anyone knows..... Heres the problem, I&#039;ve done quite a bit of X tabs and molly over the past few years, probably way more than I should lol, but I&#039;m still functioning it seems like&nbsp; :o, and once I started using the road molly and I have had quite a few dances together. I don&#039;t know if its just because the shit off the road is so pure or what, but one night throughout the night about 2 months ago I took a little over a half gram of some good molly off the road, real good molly, ended up having sex after I took the last tenth so I was pretty out of it by then, would&#039;ve had sex at the peak of the first tenth but we were with some friends for most of the night then went back home..... As soon as we got home my girl and I split the last .3 and it brought our roll back up some, before we had sex though I had to pee pretty bad, so heres where the problem starts, I go try to pee but nothing comes out, for about 10 minutes I&#039;m just standing in the bathroom trying with everything I&#039;ve got to just take a piss, I finally give up and for some reason think maybe it&#039;ll come out easier after we have sex..... So we fuck but it doesn&#039;t last too long because were both pretty out of it by then and are thinkin just laying there listening to some pink floyd until we pass out sounds pretty good, so we both get up to try and pee but after both of us are in the bathroom for about 15 minutes we both come out and realize were having the same problem :/, we decide to try again but have no scuccess. By now my bladder is bulging with my veins popping out and its kinda painful, so we both decide we&#039;ll go to bathroom and concentrate as much as we possibly can until sumthin comes out, after about a half an hour my girl finally says she was able to go and once she started it flowed like nothing.... So I&#039;m pretty excited about this news and I try to concentrate as much as I could, after 45 minutes, still, nothing. By now I am in pretty hardcore physical pain, I&#039;m freakin myself out in my head too and my mind is so worn out from rolling all night that I&#039;m in need of some good sleep, when I try to lay down though I can&#039;t even move because I&#039;m in pain, so I literally sit in the bathroom for the next 4 hours, noddin out and in some pretty excruciating pain, it almost seemed like when the roll started to wear off for the most part I was finally able to piss, I almost had my girl take to the hospital that night, it was that bad..... I&#039;ve had a couple experiences somewhat similar since then but none as bad as that, I also haven&#039;t taken as much as I did that night, the most being 3 and a hlf tenths, also haven&#039;t had sex on it since then because I felt that could&#039;ve been part of the problem, which kind of sucks because sex on x is amazing, I try not to drink as much water as I did that night because I thought maybe I drank too much, not too positive why that happens but I do know I never want to have to experience that again or have anyone else have to experience that shit..... Sorry for rambling on so much but I just wanted to explain myself so maybe someone could give some advice, thank you for any input my friends!!

				Yeah, MDMA and MA and AMP do that. Bladder necks don&#039;t like stimulants, apparently. <br />It&#039;s not that infrequent.<br />Search for MDMA and urinary retention. Tons of articles out there.<br />Several Bluelight threads too.<br /><br />Edited out abstracts; forum will be withering and I won&#039;t be able to update.<br />Check pubmed.<br />

				Sit down on the toilet<br />Try whistling, sounds stupid but it has worked for me in the past. <br /><br />And recently I read something about holding your breath for like 1minute. Because you&#039;re not exhaling CO2 it&#039;ll just stay and accumulate in your blood, apparently it relaxes you.

				I know it&#039;s stupid in most peoples minds, but when I do molly, I usually do about a gram over four doses. I have this problem every single time and what I have found is that if I drink enough water and focus hard enough I can go. Just close your eyes and only focus on your penis clear every other thought out of your brain and it will just flow.

				This is normal happens to lots of people when you have high doses and have been rolling for a while.<br /><br />What I have found that helps if you take deep breaths to calm yourself down and with your hands keep pushing lightly on you bladder until you pee.<br /><br />NpB

				Yeah it definitely happens with a lot of stims, I think it&#039;s something to do with the vasoconstriction. The worst is when you feel you need to piss but can&#039;t, then your dick will start dripping like a leaking faucet. Very uncomfortable and annoying, little wet spot on your pants lol. Eat some hot peppers, the hotter the better, I find this alleviates the problem to an extent.<br /><br />Also, I get this more with MDA and the APB&#039;s than with MDMA, but I&#039;m much less likely to redose MDMA compared with those two, and if I do it&#039;s just a little bump to bring me back up a bit.

				Hey guys, try taking green tea extract (EGCG). It is a potent diuretic that will help with the urinary retention arising from MDMA induced vasopressin release. You should find if you properly supplement prior and during the roll, you&#039;ll be able to use the restroom a lot more easily.<br /><br />Check out the following study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574714

				I Know this is going to sound silly, but here goes- I&#039;m a heavily experienced MDMA user and go back to &quot;golden days&quot; of ecstasy, and it was always a classic cure for said ailment. It doesn&#039;t take much focus, actually, do your best to relax, and while you have assumed position, start doing rudimentary math in your head...multiples, short division, times tables.

				All right - twp pages and no one else mentioned it so time for the Doctor of E to lay down his prescription:<br /><br />TAKE A PISS BEFORE YOU START ROLLING!<br /><br />If you still need to take a piss after than consider this interesting fact:<br /><br />A large amount of MDMA consumed orally will not be metabolized in the stomach and will simply be passed through the body by way of urine and so&nbsp; drinking your own piss can get you high... do you really need that temptation during a roll? No... so make sure to take a piss before that starts sounding like a good idea.
