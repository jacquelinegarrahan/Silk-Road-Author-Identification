				I get asked a lot if the NBOMe series caps I sell could be physically harmful in anyway, I always reply with nobody knows but I highly doubt in the micro gram doses I sell them at that they are, I have always refused sale of the actual powder due to the unknown toxicity of it.<br />I was wondering what substances are actually toxic at micro gram doses. I know a few bacteria are toxic all the way down to nano grams but I want to really find out how many actual chemicals are toxic in HUMANS at micro gram levels. If anybody can give me a full list I will reward them with 3 caps of 25i/c NBOMe ?but if you dont know them all please still feel free to post any known to you as I believe it cannot be many at all!<br />Ps I could be totally wrong and there could be 1000s so please correct me if this is the case!<br />TYL3R D

				The majority of substances are going to be toxic at a mg/kg dose. But there are substances and toxins that are microgram or nanogram per kg lethal, such as some of these listed:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose#Examples<br /><br />Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t worry about your product killing anyone.<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				The LD50 of polonium-210 is 89 nanograms. Acute toxicity and possibly death can be caused by as little as 10ng inhaled, 50ng ingested.<br /><br />Theoretically a gram could poison 20 million people, of which 10 million would die.

				Cyanide, arsenic, mercury , carbon monoxide and such are most certainly not deadly at microgram levels - in fact they are harmless in milligram doses in single exposures.<br /><br />As far as being toxic in very small doses the bacterial toxin botulinium would probably be at the top of the list, with about 1/3rd of a microgram being sufficient to kill an adult when inhaled or injected. The toxic cocktail produced by anthrax bacteria isn&#039;t that far behind though, and the toxin produced by tetanus bacteria is comparable in potency. <br /><br />As far as non-bacterial poisons go, nerve agents like sarin are relatively less toxic. The fatal dose is in the other of 10 micrograms if injected into an adult. <br />
