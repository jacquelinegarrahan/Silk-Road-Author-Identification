				Hi there!<br /><br />I&#039;ve just transferred 10 bitcoins, and I am about to order some 200 mgc lsd blotters...<br />I haven&#039;t ever had any sort of drugs before (nor have I smoked anything, including standard cigarettes) , so I really have no idea of where to start..<br /><br />I know that it is advised to be with other people when tripping for the first time, but I really don&#039;t have the chance to, so I am just going to be home alone .<br /><br />Can someone please tell me what I should expect or if there are any precautions I should take?<br />I really have no idea of what to do, or as a matter of fact, how to take the blotter... (should I just swallow it?)<br />Is there anything I should beware of? Can a trip potentially be dangerous ? [it&#039;s worth saying that I live in the middle of nowhere, so there is no risk of me running into a car or meeting other people while on it even with going outside. I also don&#039;t have any balconies or high windows, so if I were to believe that windows diving was cool, while tripping, I would fall for 1 meter in the worst case scenario]<br /><br />Any inputs are welcome..<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d say only take 1 blotter for your first time. Just keep it under your tongue for around 20 minutes and then swallow it if you wish. 1 blotter should not be overwhelming. Surround yourself with positive vibes and things that make you happy, you&#039;ll have a great time. Your favorite music will be wonderful while tripping.

				Be around happy things and maybe watch a movie or something when you drop it. Sometimes if you&#039;re really into something you don&#039;t even notice the change until you start doing something else. No matter what as long as you&#039;re not physically harming yourself nothing bad can happen to you on LSD. Just relax and chill :D

				First thing I&#039;d reply with, is don&#039;t get caught up/believe some of the old time cliches regarding acid.<br /><br />You can look in the mirror, if you do X, you&#039;ll have a bad trip, if you do X amount you&#039;ll be clinically insane....<br /><br />Then before hand, make sure you have enough food and drink so that you don&#039;t have to go out for anything.&nbsp; I always experienced a lack of appetite when tripping, but usually was thirsty for a cold beer.&nbsp; Have your cell phone charged in case you want to talk to someone, or have a friend pick you up to go some place.<br /><br />I would put the hit on my tongue, and typically suck on it for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Like Prawl wrote, be in a good and comfortable environment.<br /><br />I liked listening to music (Although it is a cliche, I enjoyed listening to Pink Floyd, as well as the Beatles.&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard stuff on the albums that I never heard in a sober head).<br /><br />Also like Awesome wrote, just take 1 hit to start with.&nbsp; I&#039;d estimate you&#039;ll first start feeling symptoms of tripping before you&#039;re having any visual hallucinations.<br /><br />So long story short:&nbsp; Have a good and comfortable place to relax up to 7 hours, have some good music ready, some drink chilled, comfortable clothes, and just relax and enjoy the ride.

				LSD is a fascinating drug and there is so much information out there, and subjective opinions from some well informed and some not so well informed people.<br /><br />I prefer to get my information directly from the source, so I recommend reading Albert Hoffmans&#039; LSD: My Problem Child http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child.htm <br /><br />In particular, chapter 4 - First Self-Experiment by a Psychiatrist. Think what you will about psychiatry, but the writing is absolutely phenomenal.

				LSD affects everyone differently, so I can only speak from my own experiences with LSD in a wide variety of settings.&nbsp; Make sure you are in a comfortable setting from the beginning, and try to have an optimistic view of how it&#039;s going to affect you. I prefer to take LSD while by myself in nature. When that is an impossibility, I take it in my backyard or in the comfort of my living room. If you take it in your house you should have beautiful things around you to be able to fully appreciate the experience.&nbsp; Watching TV or playing video games sounds to me like a waste of LSD. The main effect of a moderate dose of LSD for me, aside from the visual distortions, is ego reduction, an enhancement of creative thinking and an increased appreciation of beautiful things. But it also intensifies my disgust for everything that is ugly and tasteless, so I always ensure there are no unpleasant sights, objects, sounds or odours in my environment. I also make sure I&#039;m very clean and my hunger is satisfied. Also don&#039;t be around lots of people. Any slight anxiety or paranoia is intensified a thousandfold while on LSD. Don&#039;t walk around in an area with traffic because you may misjudge distances, and basic things like crossing the street can be confusing.

				Thanks to everyone for your advices, I will definitely follow them. And thank you winterjacket for the link, I&#039;ll look into it..<br /><br />LSD sounds more and more interesting as I get more informations. Anyway, given that this is going to be my first time, what dosage do you think would be best between 200 and 350mgc?<br />I think that the 350 would have much greater effects, but at the same time , I wouldn&#039;t risk a too powerful experience, since I really don&#039;t know how I am going to react.. Which one would you advise?<br /><br />And also, as I work in an executive position in a relatively large firm, I really cannot risk having my mind &quot;blown&quot; for more than one day.. So if I for example were to take it on a friday night, or maybe on a saturday morning , would my &quot;processing power&quot; be fine/working as before , by monday?<br /><br />Thanks again..

				The first time I took L, I didn&#039;t even think I was tripping.&nbsp; Everyone else was, who took the same dosage.&nbsp; Someone had to actually point out to me, &quot;See that pattern over there? See how it looks like it breathing?&quot;, and then I saw it.&nbsp; Maybe it was some weakass shit or I have a high tolerance or somthing.&nbsp; After that, I knew the effects and could see them better.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken 1500+ mics on a few occasions and while it was extremely intense, I never wanted to jump out a window...&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t believe the propaganda

Thats what it should do and will do to you. But only the few hours it lasts. No worries. <br />But I will never give a firsttimer such a high dose, esp. not if this person will do it without a sitter.<br /><br />Some stories here seems to make the impression that L can be easily handled. No it can`t! <br />Right you will not jump out of the window because you think you can fly.. (well prob. not) But I have seen full grown man going mad and want it to stop.

But dont touch the 2nd or the 3rd before 1,5 - 2 hours are over. <br /><br />If it wasn`t enough. Wait some time (days) and take more.<br /><br />200µg + trips are really not easy. <br /><br />

				1) Don&#039;t assume the potency you&#039;ve been quoted is even remotely accurate<br />2) Don&#039;t go into it expecting to &#039;meet god&#039; or see walls literally melting. Keep your expectations to a minimum and just enjoy. The first visual distortions are really fun, from there you can go lay down in the dark with some music and chill out or try exploring, depends on your mood and what you&#039;re after.<br />3) Don&#039;t buy into the &#039;bad trip&#039; hype. On the kind of doses sold on SR you&#039;ll be extremely likely to ever get so out of it that you think you&#039;re bleeding to death, want to hug trains or any of the usual shit people use to scare others away from acid.<br /><br />but all that said<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t underestimate what it can do to you. Be respectful and don&#039;t try to be a hero dropping a whole 10-strip at once. Respect her and she&#039;ll respect you.<br /><br />Have fun.

				Be around people you can trust and feel comfortable with. And not too many. And who hopefully don&#039;t act extremely bizarre when on drugs (maybe this is just a personal preference, but I don&#039;t like being really weird people when I&#039;m on lsd/shrooms). <br /><br />Oh, and in my opinion, being around a bunch of drunk people while on LSD is overwhelming and kind of annoying.

				My advice would be to at least take over 150 ug or if you&#039;re brave 300 ug+, also on the peak smoke weed. Why? Because it potentates the trip A LOT where OEV/CEV will be much more stronger. The downside is that it ll be more clouded/dulled/less clean and more of enjoyment rather insight into yourself. I didn&#039;t really find this a problem because your first trip will probably be a &quot;haze&quot; and more a &quot;fun-house&quot; experience. <br />I guess it depends if you can handle it, if you have second thoughts take 1 hit and smoke weed which will be more than satisfying. Maybe even another hit an hour or 2 later (I&#039;m not sure how quick tolerance builds but I hear about people taking x amount of hits a few hours later and intensifying their trip)<br />Also I tripped by my self, and everything went fine. This is also suggested (by me) because you can get a little crazy :P and with people around you, you might feel restricted.<br />I wish I went over 150ug~ now, so that&#039;s why I&#039;m suggesting to kick up the dosage as you&#039;re first trip will be quite memorable and intense.<br />Either way I am sure you will be pleased! <br />Have a good trip :)

				Take One and a half so you do enough to trip but not trip hard crazy balls haha. Also the mind is an amazing thing. Taking LSD is just like dreaming. The next day you feel energized,refreshed,Clear mind, and insanely happy haha ;). Psychedelics are truly the only real medicine out there. It cures seriously almost EVERYTHING! Like People don&#039;t relize how much perception can affect their whole life/world. This world is just a projection of yourself. And the only thing that is happening is what is happening RIGHT NOW and TO YOU. EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE AND NOT REAL. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS HAPPENING.

				Thanks to everyone for your comments and tips!<br /><br />The C20H25N3O has just been delivered to the drop address and I definitely can&#039;t wait to try it out.. (Incredibly ingenious packaging btw)<br /><br />Unfortunately I can&#039;t really be with anyone since all of my friends are &quot;suits&quot;/&quot;high society&quot;/&quot;elite&quot; people who use homeopathic medicines, don&#039;t do any drugs,smoke, nor drink more than a half glass of wine ,earn 150k+/yr and eat only organic/raw food and I highly doubt that anyone of them would ever do drugs,(and even if some of them did, they would definitely keep it for themselves) nor keep me company while on tripping. <br />I think that if I ever were to ask, in the best case scenario they would have me arrested and called the media and then the cops..<br /><br />Anyway, I am going to follow all of your advices and try it out as soon as I get a chance to be alone and undisturbed for 18hrs+<br />I&#039;m really looking forward to experience by myself all of the incredible effects I always heard about..<br /><br />I will keep my iPad handy and try to write a log of what I experience and then update you guys. (do you think that I will be able to write while on it?)<br /><br />As a side question, I am also short-sighted, and I don&#039;t really see very well and in detail with glasses, so do you think I should wear some extra-strong contact lines in order to see perfectly (and I guess get more out of the trip?) or is it just an unnecessary detail?

				I agree with most of the people here, you will be fine, just take 1. Sort out your music before hand and anything else you might like to play with or do. If there is one word of advice i can give you its this <br /><br />FOR FUCK SAKE DONT PANIC !!! if you do, remember its a drug and it WILL DEFFO ware off in 8 to 12 hours. <br /><br />I took a half carrier bag of liberty caps when i was 13 as my first drug. We took them in an abandoded church and my head fell apart lololol. But once i got out of there and went adventuring on my own its was awesome :D i think tripping is a wonderfull thing and LSD is probably the nicest psycodelic out there. allthough i do like a sniff of 2c-b every now and again.<br /><br />Main thing is that you enjoy your self. and if you would be so kind, write up on here your experience !<br /><br />Take care, have fun<br /><br />Skunky<br />

				First off make sure your mind is right, and by that I mean make sure you are in a good mood to begin with and no stress. This is the foundation to your trip, and if you are worried or upset before hand taking psychadelics will only bring that emotion and thoughts out more and for someone who isn&#039;t experience this can be overwhelming and difficult.<br /><br />Next make sure you are in a familiar, comfortable, and relaxing environment with little outside distractions such as people who you don&#039;t want to speak with while tripping or anything that can interrupt you that you wouldn&#039;t want to deal with while tripping. I for instance prefer my basement, and make sure I am not having any visitors expected or important things to do that day.<br /><br />Familiarity is a big key when tripping, and will keep you feeling safe and secure, because it is what you usually do and has a big comforting effect to your brain, so chill out and if you usually listen to music listen to your favorite band or one thing I like to do is watch a Disney movie from my early childhood, because it brings back good memories and reminds me of feeling safe and free.<br /><br />Once you have started tripping and feel comfortable in your trip then I would go in your yard if it is private and enjoy the nature, but only if you feel safe doing this. Being outside is very awesome and you pick up on nature a lot more and can hear everything going on like the leaves rustling isn&#039;t one thing, you can hear each individual leaf and feel each part of the air move on your body instead of air as a collective.<br /><br />If your trip for whatever reason goes south and you start getting anxious and are having a difficult time go back to things that are familiar and sing a song you really like that is happy, this will take your mind off things and make you relax and feel safer. Laying in bed is common, because generally it is a very safe place and provides comfort with blankets. I have sung my ABC&#039;s before, because that is what was easiest and came to mind first instead of having to remember a song.

				Well thanks again, I think that I am going to try it out tomorrow..<br />I am still unsure whether I should remain at home or go into the woods though.. (I am afraid that it could be kind of dangerous since I live nearby fjords and sort of high cliffs)<br /><br />Anyway, as a side question, since I am quite shortsighted, do you think that I should wear contacts (I see better with them than with normal glasses) to fully enjoy the visual effects/patterns and stuff, or is it likely to make no difference at all in the trip?

				I would stay at home then go to the woods if you feel up to it.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to be having a good trip trekking through the woods when suddenly you realize you haven&#039;t been paying attention and are completely lost, panick will set in and then you will feel even more lost, so just get a feel for home first and then maybe a trek in the woods, but close to the tree line just to look at nature.<br /><br />I would wear your contacts or have glasses handy just so that in case you do need them you don&#039;t have to worry about putting them in which I would assume would be a hard task and not very enjoyable when tripping.
