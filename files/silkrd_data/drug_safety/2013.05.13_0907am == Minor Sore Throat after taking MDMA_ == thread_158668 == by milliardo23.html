				Ok so I rolled last month and took about 5 mollies at an event. Keep in mind these are pretty clean and STRONG. 2 would usually get me rolling for almost 4-5 hours!<br /><br /><br />Anyways, started at 6pm, ended at like 2am. <br /><br />Took 5 total (which is the most I ever took, only take 2 usually)<br /><br />Had a blast, the come down wasn&#039;t that bad except that my throat was KILLING ME for 2 days. Then it became bearable and faded.<br /><br /><br />So a month later,&nbsp; I started noticing last week that when I swallow (whether food, lick pussy, drink water, and swallow my spit) it hurts a LITTLE. It&#039;s not like a sore throat, just a 1/10 pain. It&#039;s pretty hot where I am and I seem pretty healthy atm so the only thing I can think of is the MDMA use from a month ago.<br /><br />Btw I only roll maybe once every 2-5 months, so I&#039;m not an e-tard. From 2010-now, probably only did it like less than 9 times<br /><br />Has anyone ever experienced this? (sorry for my lame joke about the licking&nbsp; :P)

				Me and all my people always found it very common to wake up with nasty soar throats the next day after an E binge. Usually went away after a day or three. I dont think its anything to bug out about.

				MDMA can temporarily affect your immune system making any virus infection much worse that it usually is. The first time ever I took MDMA I ended becoming the most sick I have ever been in my life (got pneumonia). I was really scared at the time that I had taken an illegal drug and became horrifically sick. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure the sore throat will pass in a day or two. Don&#039;t do drugs if you are the least bit sick.
