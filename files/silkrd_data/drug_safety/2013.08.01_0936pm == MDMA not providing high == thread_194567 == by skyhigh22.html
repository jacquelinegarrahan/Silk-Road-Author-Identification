				I take 125mg for dancing at festivals but lately have not been getting high - still get big eyes, sweaty, jaw clenching and endurance but feel sober in my head and don&#039;t feel &#039;happy&#039;<br /><br />At present, I&#039;m having more joy with vodka (350ml per night) but it&#039;s not good for the liver.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried several SR vendors and product seems pretty much identical - the first ever batch I had was white crystal and that did put a big smile on my face but it was a while ago and I&#039;ve lost the vendors name - is there a chance it could have been cut with something, or could white be better than tan or could it just be it was my first few times?<br /><br />Thinking of trying coke but put off by snorting, short high and comedown.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				give methylone a shot in the 180-200mg range. mdma is usually too sedating for me to feel all that dancey anyways.

				that&#039;s strange, are you on any meds? SSRI&#039;s/anti depressants of any kind? Taken any other drugs recently?<br />Try changing the set and setting of when you use it. This can actually have a big impact on your roll. I find MDMA is best used with a partner/lover staying in. Or a group of close friends when you go out somewhere with your favorite music (festival and such alikes)<br />How many times have you taking MDMA in your life?<br />&nbsp;

				I wonder if some good amphetamines might boost the pleasurable effects of MDMA for you.&nbsp; A lot of street MDMA is cut with amp, and many people actually prefer the combined effect.&nbsp; I know people that mix pure molly and d-amphetamine powder everytime they do it.&nbsp; White powdered MDMA is often cut with some kind of amp.

				Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; Don&#039;t have trouble dancing, it&#039;s the lack of happiness / high that&#039;s the problem - not sure adding speed would help with that.<br /><br />I remember a UK Channel 4 show where Keith Allen was given pure MDMA and didn&#039;t get anything from it - maybe it&#039;s person specific.<br /><br />Still wonder if that first batch was slightly different though...<br /><br />I also wonder what was in the pills during the second summer of love in the late 80s - I wasn&#039;t there but it sounds like the raves were more loved up than what they are today.

				same for me. ive been rolling for ab out 8-9 years now. but the last few years it just hasnt been the same as it was in the beginning.. i dont roll as hard, im not as happy, sometimes i just feel uncomfortable. but were always out in the club when i roll now. back in the day wed just chill at home, i think that was a better environment, good to mix it up atleast. but idk if i just need to find better molly or pills or what.. ive been sort of depressed-ish the last few years tho also. one of my theories is that my brain just doesnt produce enough dopamine or serotonin to make myself roll :/&nbsp;

				Hmmm.... sounds like you&#039;re taking either too much consistently, you&#039;re on some medicine that is preventing the &#039;magic&#039;, OR you&#039;re getting shitty product. Might I suggest OldAmsterdams. His is on point!<br /><br />Ryno

				I took the last 200mg of my 1 gram of molly, didn&#039;t feel much of anything despite having a fantastic time on the rest of it.<br /><br />Perhaps it was cut unevenly, perhaps it was because I had taken Xanax earlier in the day, perhaps it was because I rolled four weeks ago and took an SSRI right after. *shrugs*

				You also might check out some methylone. Most people can&#039;t even tell the difference, but there is a slight one. You don&#039;t need all the serotonin for it either. I personally love m1 and think it&#039;s better than mdma. Doesn&#039;t make you feel so fucking cracked out and drained afterwards.<br /><br />Ryno

				+1 on the M1 suggestion! Similar to MDMA but it can be taken for longer without losing its effects. Also, when the buzz dies down, take some more and you come right back up! It has a different kind of magic to MDMA, it made me feel that like a kid all over again... just content and loved up in general. If you want to really have a good time, take Meph with it, that combo is one hell of a euphoric combo! If you do get M1, parachute it, IMO its the best way to take it.

				Happens sometimes... depends on your mood and how much you&#039;ve eaten i think... if your down it&#039;s just not going to work the same way. And if your stuffed of food it&#039;s just not going to get absorbed the same way by the body. Also taking it before alcohol may help...<br />what i usually do is take a 180mg-200mg &quot;bomb/parachute&quot; on an empty stomach, and before taking any alcohol (well perhaps a couple beers). Then an hour afterwards i bump it with either another parachute (smaller 100mg) or snort a small (crushed) line. <br />Alternatively mixing it with speed can produce a better high, just mix it in the same paper 150mg mdma + 100mg speed.
