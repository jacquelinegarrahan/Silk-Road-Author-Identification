				Hi!<br /><br />A couple of days ago two friends and I dropped roughly 100mgs of MDMA (all from the same batch). After a while, probably an hour+, we decided to re-dose another 100mgs as we didn&#039;t get the expected euphoric heaven that we expected from the first dose. Then after another 30 minutes both my friends grabbed blankets and pillows and enjoyed what seemed to be, and also as was reported by them, the best time ever. I, however, didn&#039;t feel the same level of euphoria. Actually it was really mild -- good -- not much more. So I re-dosed yet another 100mgs, waited between 30 mins and 1 hr, and snorted 3 lines totaling about 100mgs. My friends have tried MDMA before and suggested I might have a high tolerance for MDMA, but I can&#039;t see why since the only drug we all took the past month was LSD the day before.<br /><br />Short: 400mgs+ of MDMA didn&#039;t do it for me, even though it was my first time ever and I&#039;m not on any other drugs that should cause tolerance of mdma. <br /><br />Can I do anything different next time to have a great experience?<br /><br />All suggestions are welcome.

				I assume your MDMA is actually MD and not some rubbish like MDAI. What drugs are you taking at the moment? I&#039;d leave it a few weeks until your next go. Don&#039;t take multiple doses, 150mg is a hefty dose if you have good quality MDMA. Are you using scales to weigh it out?<br /><br />Setting is suprisingly important, perhaps next time try it on a night out rather than sat at home. I&#039;ve had amazing nights out on 80mg MDMA where I was with good friends, a few drinks, good music and most importantly no expectations. On the other hand I&#039;ve dropped 200mg and railed another 50 and had a disappointing night with some rushes and slight mood elevation but little else.<br />With new drugs, don&#039;t look too hard for the effects, just enjoy your night and let it happen. <br />

				hmm i would generally say doing lsd the day before would drain alot of your serotonin but if your friends did the same..<br /><br />my guess would be your on anti depressants and if you arnt then im not sure<br /><br />very very small posibility you have some kind of super rare natural immunity.. coz yeah thats weird, doses like should be borderline dangerous not mild

				Your first dose may be too small for you and depending on what&#039;s in your system can be a factor.&nbsp; If you had a big meal and took it orally, then it may not work so well.&nbsp; Anyways, it&#039;s definitely not pure MDMA as you would have been blown out of your boots at the quantitiy you dosed.&nbsp; Go for 200mg on a mostly empty stomach, then 50mg 15 minutes after.&nbsp; <br /><br />This has helped me in the past as serotonin levels can vary from day to day.&nbsp; Take 200mg of 5-HTP an hour beforehand, then another 200mg a few hours into it, it will help keep your serotonin level up as well as help keep your brain healthy, take 100mg 5-HTP before you go to sleep too, maybe another 100mg the morning after.

				Apparently opiates can also have an effect on MDMA tolerance.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to confirm this now, but Nomad Bloodbath mentioned this on another thread.&nbsp; I had some MDMA a few weeks ago and hardly felt a thing at all (started with a 120mg does, followed by 100mg then 2 other 50mg doses), but others who dosed from the same batch reported good rolls.&nbsp; Then I saw the above mentioned post and think that was maybe why.<br /><br />Anyways, just throwing that out there.&nbsp; Cheers and good luck.<br /><br /><br />J,

				I would definitely put it down to taking acid the night before....<br /><br />But I don&#039;t know about some people on the forums.. Even with quality MDMA its not unheard of to go through a gram or more on a decent night out...

				Thanks for taking the time guys, I haven&#039;t done any more MDMA since I started this thread, but if/when I do I&#039;ll be more informed :)<br /><br />Another question: I&#039;ve heard that 2C-B is similar to MDMA chemically, but how does 2C-B affect the brain with regards to tolerance/&quot;reload time&quot; and potential neurotoxicity that is claimed by some to be an effect of MDMA?<br />Will I need to wait for weeks between 2C-B trips?

So if you redose say an hour later you won&#039;t be increasing the effects only prolonging your peak. So take your initial dose at what level you want with the first dose.<br />Toxicity is unknown.<br />I tend to get wavy words on my computer screen and strong synesthesia with my dosages an 3D hallucinations in dimly lit rooms.&nbsp; Music is a plus.<br />I feel little to absolutely no mind trip I&#039;m clear headed with visual hallucinations, I keep my mind busy with DJing music and chatting online most the time, because I run this joint.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to wait weeks, 2 times a week would be ok but you don&#039;t want it to become a habit.<br /><br />My favorite is 2C-B + MDMA...hehehe, I find the combo as very mind expanding and focused at the same time, results differing from my own have been reported.<br /><br />Just 2C-B a try one day/night...start with a 15 mg capsule. Judge your experience and then decide your own dosage for the next time.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Once a friend and I both dosed with MDMA - I was sky high and she went to sleep. Said she didn&#039;t feel a damn thing. She wasn&#039;t on any anti-depressants and had had only a little bit of mushrooms earlier in the day (as did I). A few months later she tried again and had very strong effects. I&#039;m not sure why, but it seems the brain can be in different states of receptivity to MDMA in the same person from day-to-day (or month-to-month).

				I used to do MDMA once a week for a few months there.<br /><br />I&#039;d take between 2-3 tabs on Fridays. Then Saturday would be the tripping day, and we&#039;d take acid.<br /><br />My experience was that...<br /><br />1) over time, the sideeffects became more noticeable. After a few years, i started reliably puking after dosing. This had never happened the first year.<br />2) After stopping for a month then resuming, the side effects were even more intense<br />3) taking a third dose after the first two had worn off substantially made me feel like a fucking zombie. Not recommended.<br />4) I used to LOVE taking acid, and then dropping a roll about an hour and fifteen minutes into the trip. It was AMAZING. You start coming up off your trip and finally hit your peak... and then suddenly, the MDMA starts hitting you and your peak goes through the fucking roof. I saw some of the most amazing visuals doing that. Not to mention, having edreams while taking a shower that I was still at the club!<br /><br />I havent done E in about 3 years now. But the last time I did it it was fun, but not as fun as I remember. But thats probably because of the environment.<br /><br />Oh, and I never wanted to do coke, or drink alcohol while rolling. Just numbed the effects for me.<br /><br />I always predosed the week before with plenty of 5-HTP, and then did it for a week after. I never did 5HTP on the day of the roll. And was on no antidepressants either.
