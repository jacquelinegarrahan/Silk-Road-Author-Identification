				yeah man, just completely uprooting yourself from a country you&#039;ve lived all your life to move to a country where you presumably do not know anyone is certainly easier said than done<br /><br />as for tips for selling pot. I am college aged in a major US city, most of my customers are also college kids, all you have to do is make sure you sell reasonable product for the market standard price. Most average pot smokers here have a decent idea of what good weed is, but do not really care too much as long as the quality is mid range or above. Obviously, selling better weed than standard is encouraged not required. Not to say that I&#039;m satisfied if I get a bad of shwag, but many people care less than others..<br /><br />To further help you, I&#039;d probably need to know: What kind of people would be your buyers? How good of bud can you get, for the price? What are the standard selling prices for weed there?<br /><br />also this is for my own curiousity, always interested to hear about drug markets in countries you don&#039;t hear about all the time; ie not Latin and South America.<br /><br />

				Listen to Biggie&#039;s 10 crack commandments, there are some very good one&#039;s in there. The problem with the game is finding those you can trust. If you can do that you&#039;ll be fighting your biggest problem.

				Ok Ninjuh, look here, im about to lay some serious information on you about dealing pot. Infact this single bit of information will mean the difference of life and death, in your case anyway. Are you ready??<br /><br />Here it comes...<br /><br />&nbsp;SPEND 100 DOLLARS AND BUY A FOODSAVER VACUUM SEAL MACHINE! <br /><br />But seriously all sarcasm aside ( excuse that, im poking smot), Buy a food saver, It becomes a bitch and real tedious sealing anything under a pound or kilo, but do it man. Any amount of marijuana you have, be sure to have it vacuum sealed at all times, unless absolutely in a safe and secure place. It is probably the single safest precaution any dealer can take when selling transporting or hiding marijuana. <br /><br />Do this, and when your alive, kicking and have sold X amount of marijuana, you will thank me! Good luck my friend.

				I&#039;m starting small quantity, and slowly build up a loyal customer base. If business goes well, then i&#039;ll buy vacuum machine :) Thanks for the tips. But what do you reco me, in term of small quantity say an once or two. I was planning to pack em in small zip lock bag. About 1.5gram each small zip lock bag :) Its death sentence if above 20gram :)

				Respect your customers and they will respect you...<br />If you follow this rule you could be safe for many, many years my friend. <br />Sell grams, not .7<br />Keep high quality on your products. Don&#039;t just buy cheap shit because your profit would be bigger. <br />Be smart, see what people want and always carry with you only so you can get charged with possession.<br /><br />BTW personally I wouldn&#039;t do it if I was living in that shithole. No offense, where I&#039;m coming from is also a shithole but no death penalties.

				I sold a reasonable amount of weed in my youth. I don&#039;t know how much of this would apply to Malaysia, but if I were to start dealing again (and learn from my mistakes) I&#039;d say:<br /><br />1. Never lie about your weight or the quality of your weed.<br />2. Never invite buyers to your home - always meet them somewhere.<br />3. Never carry more than you need to.<br />4. Encourage your customers to text you rather than call. Get a prepaid SIM for this.<br />5. Never give people weed &#039;on credit&#039; unless you&#039;re happy with not getting paid for it.<br /><br />..If I were dealing somewhere with the death penalty, though, I&#039;d take much more precautions. For example I would have a trusted friend collect the money, and leave the drugs at a &#039;dead drop&#039; to be collected.

				The &#039;texting via prepaid SIM&#039; card idea is for a few reasons:<br /><br />1. It stops your customers knowing anything about your real identity, so they can&#039;t get you in trouble, and:<br />2. If you decide to stop selling, you won&#039;t have loads of people still calling you (which was a problem for me)<br />3. It means you don&#039;t get calls when it would be awkward to answer<br />4. You can keep a record of where you&#039;ve gotta be and when (which you don&#039;t have with calls)<br />5. It means (here in the UK at least) you can&#039;t be traced just from owning the number<br /><br />Since you have to show a Citizen&#039;s card, that rules out the benefit of 5, but you&#039;ll still get 1 - 4. I&#039;d probably get a drug-free friend to register it for me, though - as long as they&#039;re okay with lying and saying they lost the SIM if they ever get busted. And even if they tell all and lead the police to you, it would buy you some time to get rid of your stash.
