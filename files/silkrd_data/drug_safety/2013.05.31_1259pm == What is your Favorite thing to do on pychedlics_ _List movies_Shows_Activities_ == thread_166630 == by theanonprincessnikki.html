				I have only seen Enter the Void the one time, but I think it would make me feel a bit uncomfortable while tripping! Fantastic movie though, and I&#039;d choose it over Irreversible if I had to watch one of them on drugs, that&#039;s for sure!<br /><br />I recently enjoyed Waking Life, The Fountain and Up all under the influence. Adventure Time is definitely one of my favourite shows to watch, as well as Off The Air which you can find on youtube.<br /><br />If you&#039;re doing it with a few friends, and are stuck indoors... I like to make the room completely different to what everyone is used to, to turn it into another place. One way of doing this is to blow up 150-200 balloons - as many as possible really. What you do with them depends on the room. One idea is to create a sort of balloon pen by pushing sofas together. You can then wade through/lie in hundreds of balloons. Kick one balloon, watch them all shoot up in the air and float. Depending on your access to cheap and plentiful balloons, you can do this for under $10. Turn your living room into a nonsensical parade.<br /><br />Ideally though, get yourself tripping in a beautiful and isolated place. I really like tripping out on large hills that can see endlessly over the land.

				Grateful Dead concert.<br /><br />Like, literally, my entire top ten list of best trips would all be Grateful Dead concerts.&nbsp; And that&#039;s not because I never tripped anywhere else.<br /><br />Edit: Now that I think about it, there was another evening I mentioned in some other thread, involving marathon sex and a few other non-psychedelic drigs, that would have to make it onto that list somewhere.&nbsp; Not sure exactly where, but it&#039;s definitely in the top ten.&nbsp; If I think of any others that are also not Grateful Dead concerts, I will edit this post again.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				On shrooms I like waling in forests or parks during the first half of the trip and during the second half all I wanna do is go in bed and roll around under my blanket because it feels so soft and so good.<br />On ketamine I like listening to techno while lying down, but there isn&#039;t much more your can do on K anyways. A static screensaver looks intense enough on K (and really weird) so I really wouldn&#039;t want to watch a movie even on a low dose.<br />I really don&#039;t like screens on shrooms so TV is out of the question for me and music isn&#039;t really so enhanced on shrooms. Shrooms are also fun to take in groups since they make you laugh so much. <br />I don&#039;t have that much experience with psychedelics though, only shrooms and K. Deep conversations would be impossible on either of those, I would either not be able to talk or just laugh for stupid things... Waterparks or swimming could be fun but I wouldn&#039;t do it if there&#039;s too many people around because of paranoia.<br /><br />And Enter The Void would seem like a really cool movie to watch while tripping... Too bad screens hurt my eyes when tripping. Maybe on LSD it&#039;s different and watching TV, going to waterparks and all that is possible...

				I know its cliche, but... watching The Wizard of Oz with the sound off while listening to Pink Floyd&#039;s Dark Side of the Moon. Start Dark Side of the Moon after the 3rd lion road on the MGM logo thing in the beginning. And put the soundtrack on repeat. <br />

There are also trippy visuals. We like to listen to psychedelic music like psytrance or psychill while watching ehm.. milk something a visualisation program in winamp. It will blow your mind.<br /><br />I also like to make fractals or psychedelic music. But you have to need the skills.<br /><br />Damn, time for psychedelics... only have nbome 25c and i or something.<br />Oh well while on GHB and alcohol just will take all of it. What the hell.<br /><br />Might be time to get off of this forum though. Get all horny and trippy as being a vendor.. not a good idea :P<br /><br />Oh, milkdrop I think it was. Gonna download it.. hope the psychedelic rc&#039;s still work.. already too intoxicated :D
