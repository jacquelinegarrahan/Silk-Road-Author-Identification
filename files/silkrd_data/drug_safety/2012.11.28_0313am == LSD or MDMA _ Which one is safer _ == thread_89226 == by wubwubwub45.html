				I had an argue with a friend and he most likely pulled out facts that wasnt that great in my opinion about LSD was worst than MDMA but i know for&nbsp; fact that MD is kind of highly neurotoxic. What do you guys think? Its would be nice to have some facts too to support your opinion :)

				it really depends on in what way you mean. in terms of overdosing, LSD is definitely safer, requiring around 100,000uq to overdose, as opposed to mdma which has a much smaller number. however, LSD can bring out mental illness. personally, i enjoy both :)

				I don&#039;t think &quot;which is safer&quot; is the right question to ask, considering safe use of either drug depends more on the responsibility of the individual using them. Asking &quot;which generally causes more harm&quot; is a better question in my opinion. And my answer to that question would be MDMA. I love both of these substances, but I think MDMA is more addictive, has more potential for abuse, and is definitely more neurotoxic. Potential harm coming from LSD is primarily psychological, and of course, that psychological influence can lead to physical harm... but interactions with the compound itself are not physiologically damaging. MDMA, on the other hand, can directly cause physiological damage, whether by its known neurotoxic effects, or by disruption of bodily systems. Particularly&nbsp; the many bodily functions for which serotonin is required. Many people don&#039;t realize it, but MDMA-induced serotonin changes can affect various organ functions. For example, it can interfere with digestion and elimination. If you&#039;ve ever noticed having bowel difficulties (ie constipation, anal bleeding/fissures) after starting to use MDMA, the serotonin changes may be to blame, as serotonin plays a role in intestinal motility and secretions.<br /><br />Long-term changes in bodily functions can result from use of MDMA, especially when used too frequently and without proper precautions (pre/post-loading with antioxidants and recovering depleted serotonin with 5HTP). <br /><br />But of course, a fool can have too much LSD and get himself seriously injured or killed as a result of some psychotic delusions. Classic example, someone has a whole lot of LSD, climbs to the top of a building, shouts &quot;I AM THE MESSENGER!&quot; and falls to his death.<br /><br />As usual, responsibility is key!

				It all depends on the dose id say. Of course 100mg LSD is far more dangerous then 100mg MDMA but even though the weight is the same it would be 1000 LSD doses and only 1 MDMA dose. You can overdose of everything, salt for example is very deadly if you swallow 10 grams or so, but that would be 500 times as much as you would put on a boiled egg. Generally speaking you should compare by normal doses, so 120ug LSD compared with 120mg MDMA and in that case MDMA is clearly the more harmful one. When you compare a dose of 120mg MDMA to a few hours horseback riding the latter is much more dangerous though. Horseback riding is safer then crossing the Israeli/Gazastrip border (unless you do that on the back of a horse). <br /><br />tl;dr the safety of things depends on a multitude of factors

But yeah ive seen that i had problems with the bowel(really fluid and less solid) since i started using MDMA. I never abused it hardcore. I did it at least once a month max for 3 months and after i waited 2 and a half months and dropped again. I think you guys made my mind a alot more clearer than what i was thinking before. Thanks alot to everyone for the good feedback =)

				LSD much more safer. 100mg of L would be 1000 doses of 100ug each. It won&#039;t kill you physically, eating 100mg of L, but rather will get your soul born again...&nbsp; :o

Which just becomes a big opinion thread.&nbsp; So with that in mind, I&#039;ll share a little experience with LSD, and my reluctance to try anything since. <br /><br />I&#039;m an old fart, most likely to you Molly/Ravers, I&#039;m assuming that, I do realize. Please don&#039;t take offense, that generalization wasn&#039;t meant to be offensive, just an identifier to juxtapose my generation.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be 51 this month. My last LSD trip was in the early 1980&#039;s, and it involved NYC, going to the top of the WTC, (not trying to fly, just pushing the limits of our own fear of heights). Lot&#039;s of colors, by the time I tried to sleep, and turned out the light in my room, it was as if I was in the Yellow Submarine cartoon film, with all of those cool animations. - FYI - It had to be Red Windowpane or what was called &quot;Half Moon blotter&quot; - really one strong blue-green blotter, so strong, it was sold as halves-thus the name. My best friend and I used to push the limits as far as dosing, to where we alienated our friends, by taking on this &quot;tripping all month&quot; phase. It was Christmas 1981, we used to walk around our suburban neighborhood (Levittown, NY) looking at Christmas lights, and watching the trails of them as we went by, carrying a radio, and really enjoying ourselves.

Asking &quot;which generally causes more harm&quot; is a better question in my opinion. And my answer to that question would be MDMA. I love both of these substances, but I think MDMA is more addictive, has more potential for abuse, and is definitely more neurotoxic. Potential harm coming from LSD is primarily psychological, and of course, that psychological influence can lead to physical harm... but interactions with the compound itself are not physiologically damaging. MDMA, on the other hand, can directly cause physiological damage, whether by its known neurotoxic effects, or by disruption of bodily systems. Particularly&nbsp; the many bodily functions for which serotonin is required. Many people don&#039;t realize it, but MDMA-induced serotonin changes can affect various organ functions. For example, it can interfere with digestion and elimination. If you&#039;ve ever noticed having bowel difficulties (ie constipation, anal bleeding/fissures) after starting to use MDMA, the serotonin changes may be to blame, as serotonin plays a role in intestinal motility and secretions.<br /><br />Long-term changes in bodily functions can result from use of MDMA, especially when used too frequently and without proper precautions (pre/post-loading with antioxidants and recovering depleted serotonin with 5HTP). <br /><br />But of course, a fool can have too much LSD and get himself seriously injured or killed as a result of some psychotic delusions. Classic example, someone has a whole lot of LSD, climbs to the top of a building, shouts &quot;I AM THE MESSENGER!&quot; and falls to his death.<br /><br />As usual, responsibility is key!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Best response on this thread!&nbsp; &nbsp;(so far)&nbsp; &nbsp;IMHO<br />Most of this discussion became which flavor Ice Cream is truly the best. Which just becomes a big opinion thread.&nbsp; So with that in mind, I&#039;ll share a little experience with LSD, and my reluctance to try anything since. <br /><br />I&#039;m an old fart, most likely to you Molly/Ravers, I&#039;m assuming that, I do realize. Please don&#039;t take offense, that generalization wasn&#039;t meant to be offensive, just an identifier to juxtapose my generation.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be 51 this month. My last LSD trip was in the early 1980&#039;s, and it involved NYC, going to the top of the WTC, (not trying to fly, just pushing the limits of our own fear of heights). Lot&#039;s of colors, by the time I tried to sleep, and turned out the light in my room, it was as if I was in the Yellow Submarine cartoon film, with all of those cool animations. - FYI - It had to be Red Windowpane or what was called &quot;Half Moon blotter&quot; - really one strong blue-green blotter, so strong, it was sold as halves-thus the name. My best friend and I used to push the limits as far as dosing, to where we alienated our friends, by taking on this &quot;tripping all month&quot; phase. It was Christmas 1981, we used to walk around our suburban neighborhood (Levittown, NY) looking at Christmas lights, and watching the trails of them as we went by, carrying a radio, and really enjoying ourselves.

				In my opinion mdma is the safer drug because it is a stimulant.<br />I have experience with both, mdma (stimulant) and mushrooms (halocinogen) and I must say I felt safer with extasy.<br />Lsd is a halocinogen which cause huge hallucinations so you should not do lsd alone.<br />You need a person which takes care of you.<br />Sorry for my bad english :)

I just do not feel the same effect from MDMA as I did the first few times I&#039;ve tried it. And this is after take extended breaks from the stuff. This is not to say that you cannot build up a tolerance to LSD. I just feel like it takes much longer to do so. LSD always hits me the same way every time. I never have to worry about quality or purity. Just dosage (in ug). Furthermore, the comedown from LSD is almost non-existent. Whereas the comedown from MDMA is definitely there every single time in one way or another. <br /><br />All in all, I personally believe LSD is much much more safer than MDMA. People have been taking LSD for years and years. MDMA, at least in my area has only recently started to boom to a huge scale. So I would say it is relatively new...ish when compared to LSD. But not really.<br /><br />Just take a tab. You&#039;ll thank me later.

				I think that everyone before using any psychedelics should learn and read a lot about it... Knowledge it&#039;s most important imo... When we r confident about it I can&#039;t imagine bad trip... Stanislav Grof, Timothy Leary, Albert Hofmann, Sasha Shulgin it&#039;s basic... We need to be well prepared before trippin&#039;... It&#039;s not about safe drug... When our mind is prepared for psychedelics ur s safe. !&nbsp; Much love bros,<br /><br />acidsoldier

				According to Stanislav Grof symptoms of bad trip mostly will help us because it&#039;s kind of memories from our live and in conclusion we can fight, destroy and change our problems/troubles...&nbsp; For me it&#039;s best medicine...
