				Anyone know if this is safe or unsafe to do?<br /><br />Freaks me out the idea of using downers while high on coke. Is it a bad combo?

				Not necessarily bad as long as you don&#039;t over do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />You will actually feel a lot better and more relaxed.&nbsp; If you take a downer while using coke you will be speed balling and feeling great.&nbsp; The best of both worlds one could say.&nbsp; You will feel the calmness of the downer that takes away the paranoia and speediness of the upper while getting all the euphoria.&nbsp; Creates a wonderful smooth ride.&nbsp; <br /><br />Taking benzos for after a long day of using coke or any speedy drug is perfect.&nbsp; Popping 10-20mg of valium or 1-2mg of xanax or 1-2mg of klonopin is the best.&nbsp; Even better would be taking one of those and smoking some pot and going to sleep way easier.<br /><br />You need to start worrying when your mixing downers which could cause a coma or cause you to stop breathing in your sleep.&nbsp; For example benzos and heroin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy

				valium has a very long half life 20-100 hours<br />Xanax is around 12 hours.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to wake up groggy the next day something like zopiclone with a 3.5 hour half life would be much better suited.<br /><br />I would personally recommend a couple of bongs of nice weed before bed.

				Wait until your high is over before you do it.&nbsp; Benzos like Valium are overwhelmingly safe in low in enough doses if they&#039;re not combined with other depressants.&nbsp; I would suggest a shorter acting benzo than Valium though, it&#039;d be as good or better at reduced sleep but would make you feel like less of a zombie the following morning.

				I won&#039;t do coke or amphetamines without benzos. Uh.. maybe a little coke if I know it&#039;s clean. I really like etizolam, just have to make sure I take it a good 9 hours before I have to be awake though.

				reaally surprised no one said this:<br /><br />if its quality coke, you dont need anything to help you sleep. seriously. in fact the comedown can be pretty soothing.<br /><br />ok, with that aside.<br /><br />GHB is hands down best combo with cocaine.&nbsp; hands down.<br /><br />suggestion: get quality coke and buy bluegiraffes magnificent ghb.&nbsp; take about 1 to 1.5grams of ghb on a empty stomach....snort whatever coke amount gets you magical....then stars sipping an additional gram of ghb in the next 30mins to an hour<br /><br />Results? great coke high and by the time the C trip ends...the ghb come up begins and it is a perfect, complimentary combo<br /><br />mdma then 2cb&nbsp; and cocaine then ghb&nbsp; are two fucking fantastic chemical romances.<br /><br />titties

				I think it&#039;s safe to say that for some no matter how good the coke is if they have a very addictive personality they will need something to let them chill out and stop being a fiend.&nbsp; Coke back in the 80&#039;s was way more pure than the shit of today but people were still fucking doing it every second of the day.&nbsp; Most of the time.

				my usual comedown routine after a nights binge would be 10mg diazepam just before your last line or pipe of the session, and then another 10 mg about 30 minutes later. I would also have a small amount of healthy food around this point, no matter how much I didn&#039;t feel like it, and maybe a multivitim. Make sure you are hydrated too<br /><br />I might the chill on the sofa or whatever for an hour or so and then take e 10-20mg temazepam 15 minutes before hitting the sack Perhaps a pipe or two of hash in the mix if feeling so inclined.<br /><br />This combo disposes of the anxiety of the crash and actually gives you some happy relaxing times before finally knocking you out in style. Safe too

I was a fucking zombie and lived in a haze for about 3months.I Used etiz to come off of it and that worked wonders. I really like etiz, but wouldn&#039;t use it for any other reason. Back to the subject at hand, I think the Valium helps BECAUSE OF how long it stays active. If you don&#039;t overdo it, you wake up feeling nice, calm, and worry free for a good bit of the next day.

				Cheers for the replies to my question fellow roaders!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Will get myself a few xanax through here to try them out!<br /><br />I&#039;m an awful fiender when doing coke and will even get of of bed to do lines and go back to bed which I know sounds stupid as fuck but that&#039;s just the way I am with coke!<br /><br />A xanax should put a stop to me wasting a lot of coke that I shouldn&#039;t be doing&nbsp; :)

				I don&#039;t use it that much, but I find having a stash of alprazolam (Xanax or generic) is very inherently soothing.&nbsp; It is good to know that you can always get to sleep if you need to, regardless of your state or situation.&nbsp; Sometimes I even take one.&nbsp; Also good for long flights.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got good generic stuff on SR so don&#039;t be spooked by generic if the vendor looks good.<br /><br />Be very careful combining benzos with opioids.&nbsp; Be kinda careful combining benzos with alcohol.<br /><br />Related note:&nbsp; I have found that taking a benzo first and then drinking alcohol is much more intense than the reverse order.&nbsp; It is probably safer to take the benzo first to avoid potential danger combination.&nbsp; Many times I have taken 1mg alprazolam and had one beer, felt normal.&nbsp; Than half way through the second beer....total instant lights out!

				You should be quite careful either way really.<br /><br />If you want to get the best hypnotic&nbsp; effect i&#039;d agree&nbsp; that taking the benzo early generally produces the best overall result. This does by no means decrease the risk of respiratory depression though, and could be rather dangerous.

				As long as you&#039;re using the Valium to just take the edge off or fall asleep then you&#039;re fine. Just don&#039;t get fucked up on coke and benzo&#039;s at the same time that&#039;s when you&#039;ll start having an issue.
