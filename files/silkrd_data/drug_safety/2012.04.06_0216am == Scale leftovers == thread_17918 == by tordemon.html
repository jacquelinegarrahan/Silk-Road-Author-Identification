				I made a very, very critical mistake, today. Because I knew today was going to be my last dose of heroin for a while, I naturally desired to take as much as possible at once. I&#039;d only measured out heroin for quite a while on the scale, and so when it was only at 80mg, I decided I could scrape stuff off the scale where it spilled into the base pipe.<br /><br />I go sit down in bed, take out my pipe, and begin to slowly roast the powder. I suck in as soon as the gases start to form, and it tastes oddly more normal to me so I am satisfied. As I start to lay down and relax, I start noticing lights changing around the room. &quot;This is some really trippy heroin,&quot; I thought. I looked over at the wall and noticed that there were pages of text flowing over it with whatever words popped into my mind. Hands began growing out of the wall, making clapping sounds to a beat of a song noone hears.<br /><br />That&#039;s exactly when I realize what happened: I accidentally put DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in with my heroin when I scraped the leftovers! I was scared shitless for a second -- well, about as bad anybody high on heroin can be scared. Mouths started appearing out of the fabric of objects around me, and they began to spin and swirl, and every next word I thought became an additional track layer to a repetitious yet beautiful music played by the now fully emerged heads...<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;ve rather quite enjoyed the experience. It&#039;s not what I wanted, but that&#039;s my fault. I hope that perhaps my slight misfortune may serve as a warning to you as to what could be major misfortune. Throw out the stuff that misses! Doing so is a safe and easy part of harm reduction. An un-planned combination could be fatal.

				Haha, it was pretty cool for a while, and I was surprised how little I freaked out for discovering I&#039;d smoked DMT so late into the process. And I am indeed very glad I didn&#039;t IV it. I&#039;ve always been afraid of IVing things, and so I suppose that&#039;ll stay on my side.
