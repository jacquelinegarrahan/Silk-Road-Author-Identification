				Hi,<br />I keep hearing great things about opiates and have a few friends who are hooked on them.&nbsp; Now this would turn most people away but I do not have a particularly addictive personality so i figured I&#039;d give them a shot.<br /><br />First time I took 4 Vicodin (5mg/500mg acetaminophen).&nbsp; I weigh 180lbs and I figured 2000mg acetaminophen would be fine.&nbsp; I waited an hour.&nbsp; Then 2.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t notice anything really.&nbsp; The soreness in my limbs from working out went away but that was about it.&nbsp; I know this is real stuff too because my friend got it from a doctor for post-surgery pain.<br /><br />Then I got some morphine sulfate on here (substitol) and tried 40mg.&nbsp; It is extended release and comes in wax-coated pellets but I boiled them with some water and drank that, making sure to eat the rest of the wax too when it cooled.&nbsp; I felt absolutely no noticeable effects besides, once again, the painkiller effect.<br /><br />Then I decided to take 80mg of the morphine (boiled in a spoon again) and nothing really happened.&nbsp; After 3 hours or so I felt mildly happier than usual but this could have been a placebo effect too. I just noticed I was really sleepy and kept taking naps.&nbsp; I also felt a little nauseous and had to drink a little water.<br /><br />Whats the deal? Everyone keeps saying that morphine feels incredible!&nbsp; Do I need to inject it to feel the effects?&nbsp; Because I&#039;m not into needles.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can someone shed light on this?

				I&#039;ll chime in on this one...<br /><br />I personally have never gotten any good euphoria from oral morphine. IV is where it becomes euphoric, but I&#039;ve only had that in a hospital setting.<br /><br />20mg&#039;s of hydro might not be enough for you. If you took it on a completely empty stomach, absorption is different than if you took it on a full stomach.<br /><br />Some people just don&#039;t get much out of hydrocodone. I know I had a hard time &quot;recognizing&quot; the euphoria from opiates until I was somewhat experienced with them. Now hydro is fairly euphoric, but I&#039;d give it a 6/10 compared to other opi&#039;s.<br /><br />If you wanna get some surefire euphoria, go for a decent dose of Oxycodone. It&#039;s more (unmistakably) euphoric, and its oral activity is great. <br /><br />Truth be told, you probably just botched your first shot at hydrocodone. Give it another shot, maybe next time at 30mg&#039;s or so. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t feel much, try Oxycodone.

				honestly hydrocodone is weak shit... same with morphine pills....<br /><br />Oxycodone is where its at... 20mg is GOOOD starting dose.. I remember when i got perc&#039;s for my wisdom teeth extraction.. I was feeling effects from 5mg after blazing.. I remember i took 3 and I just nodded out.. but i kept thinking i was going to OD lol.. it was great...

				Alright I guess I gotta try oxycodone.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work then I&#039;ve given up on opiates.<br /><br />Shame they are so expensive...

				Personally I like hydrocodone&#039;s being that they are pretty easily available, but I will not fuck with anything less than a 10MG and preferably the yellow Norcos which are 10/325. The 5-7 MG&#039;s do nothing but give me a headache being that it takes so many of them and all the Tylenol in them is a no go. TBH I don&#039;t see why people even bother to sell the 5&#039;s or 10&#039;s on SR. 3 Norco&#039;s and a few beers and it&#039;s all good. Smoke an L and you&#039;ll be floating. <br /><br />If you do pony up the money go for the oxy 30&#039;s or 40&#039;s, you will indeed know when that shit hits you. We are about the same size from what you listed here and I usually go with 20mg&#039;s. If you don&#039;t have an opiate tolerance start slow- make sure you read everything from the threads in this here drug safety forum and if needed look at an opium comparison chart to see how they compare to other opiates you may have experience with. <br /><br />Have fun. Be safe. Get high.
