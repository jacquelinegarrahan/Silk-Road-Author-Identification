				I&#039;ve heard so many good things about this molecule and would like to hear more.&nbsp; I would like to try it soon and would just like to here some input from anyone who has had experience with it and what positive or negatives you have to say, as well as how to get the most out of it (dosage, combos, setting, etc.).<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to come across 2C-I very early on in my explorations and really enjoyed it. The euphoria was wonderful and the controllable visual distortion was not quite like any psychedelic I had tried or have tried since. Certainly mushrooms, DMT and LSD produce some incredible visuals, but with 2C-I I remember during some trips (parts of trips) where I could very loosely control how intense and in what manner the visual distortions took place, it was wild to have such control over the effects.<br /><br />Then a couple years later I tried 2C-E frequently for a short period of time. The first time I tried it felt like I had risen my head out of water. It was as though my perceptions up until that point were like what it feels like to have your head submerged in water: my interpretation of what was around me was only partly clear and while it seemed fine and normal my whole life, it was only until I lifted my head out of the water that the world suddenly became totally clear and more vibrant and stable. 2C-E made everything make sense. So much was clear. Every little moment,every song, every person, every place, every interaction was teeming with significance and meaning. Felt like a total awakening for awhile. Not wanting that feeling to end, I overdid it a bit. I indulged in the experience for a few weeks or so, wore myself out/pushed my limits a bit, recovered, and have not taken it since (almost 4 years) nor have I had any urge to. <br /><br />The only other 2C-_ I&#039;ve had much interest in is 2C-B and being that it&#039;s one of Shulgin&#039;s favorite chemicals as well as that many people have many positive things to say about it, I&#039;m eager to give it a go.<br /><br />Please, any information about your experiences/knowledge would be greatly appreciated :)

				I like 2C-B, it mixes good in with other psychedelics (according to own experience).<br /><br />I would recommend oral route of administration, if my memory is correct the burn is quite hash, you can take to around 30% take less when snorting but if also lasts shorter + its harder to chose a dosage to get you at the level you want.<br /><br />It really depends what you want(doses estimated for 70-80kg body-weight): ~10mg for feeling a bit trippy and mild euphoria, ~20mg noticeable visuals bit stronger euphoria, ~30-40mg for a full psychedelic experience, doses beyond that have a rather high probability to cause&nbsp; discomfort/anxiety and a bad trip (i never did more than 35mg, i read that from other peoples reports) <br />If you want to snort it anyhow subtract about 30% of the recommended oral dose(this is an estimate, I only snorted it once ever)<br /><br />2C-B really is a cool drug to take if you don&#039;t want to trip for hours and is also rather cheap, i really like it, but i did not do any other 2C-s to compare them to, it feels quite a bit different to other psychedelics, however i do not know how to explain differences in words. Another positive thing to mention is that the body load is almost not existent, and it&#039;s stimulating properties keep you awake quite good while on it. From the amount of visuals(I get from it) I&#039;d compare a dosage of 40mg to about a 200Âµg hit of LSD<br /><br />Hope i could help you out a bit!
