				I&#039;m looking to give this a very conservative test run to help with chronic pain in my left elbow from years of bodybuilding, I&#039;m going to have 10 4mg pills either tomorrow or wed, should i plug them to help them last longer or just break off 1/4 of a pill and IV it, I&#039;m not exited about the idea of IV drugs but would like a good buzz but nothing that will put me in a coma, I usually take 4-5 10mg vicodin a week so i have somewhat of a tolerance built up for this ( I think) I and I know due to the strength of this stuff i should be carefull, should i just try plugging 2mg&#039;s first and see where that gets me? I realize this is an extremely ignorant post but this is my first rodeo with this stuff so please be patient with me and thanks in advance for any advice offered.

				I tried dillies for first time recently. I don&#039;t IV. I&#039;m careful at first until I know the med. I cut the 4mg into quarters the first time and snorted 1mg at a time. Ended up doing all 4mg in the first hour. It hit pretty nice. Then I bought some 8mg and like those even better. They are short acting, but be careful. I did about 12 mg during the course of about 6 hours and I was pretty high. I have a tolerance but it has diminished after a couple years on suboxone and staying away from the OCs, Dillies, vicodins... Tolerance isn&#039;t something you can really compare so start slow and learn your tolerance. I found it quite effective at pain relief too
