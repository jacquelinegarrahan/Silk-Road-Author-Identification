				So, you all probably know me well enough by now to appreciate the fact that I am far too honest about life the universe and everything.<br /><br />The other day I thought it would be fun to do a little MDMA with one of my girlfriends who hadn&#039;t done it before. Since I wanted her to have a good time we decided to plug it and go to town with her on a pretty low dose and me on my normal dose. All was well for a while. She got nauseous and puked which was a little odd for me since normally people don&#039;t puke when they plug but I figured it was just a side effect of her being a little nervous about the drug. Right after she lost it though she started having a dandy time and we enjoyed a nice roll together. She felt an odd desire to clean the house but it was her roll so we just went with it.. Another bump, more fun, more talking, all in all she had a good old time.<br /><br />Now, she needed to head off to bed and I figured I would finish up the last of the MDMA, which, since we were plugging, I had crushed up into a fine powder. Dropped it in the oral syringe, plugged it on up and waited for it to kick it.<br /><br />The next morning I guess I was found under the table. She moved me over to the couch somehow. The next thing I remember is she was telling me that I had been passed out for more than 24 hours and she was pretty sure I was going to die.<br /><br />Now, for the moral of the story.<br /><br />When Doing MDMA witrh a friend and crushing up the pills for plugging, no matter now high you might be, that bag of powder you found right before bed IS NOT some free MDMA but instead about 85mg of alprazolam powder that just happened to be in the same type of bag you had your MDMA in. Taking 85mg of alprazolam powder is hardly ever a good idea to shove right up your ass a it&#039;s about 42.5 2mg bars of Xanax. Needless to say, pretty much everyone assumed I was going to die and it was, without a doubt, the single most stupid drug related thing I&#039;ve ever managed to do. <br /><br />This should in no way be considered an endorsement of plugging huge amounts alprazolam powder up your ass but the good news is it seems that doing so does not kill you, so there is a plus to it all I guess. I ended up driving home 3.5 hours about 24 hours after I took the stuff and spent the entire trip back trying to stay on the road and alternating between which eye I kept open to avoid seeing double as with both eyes open the lanes were doing this weird convergence thing that made it impossible to tell which lane I was actually in.<br /><br />I NEVER would have done this if I had thought I had just survived a huge dose of alprazolam. I was sure I was just a little hung over off the MDMA even though the symptoms didn&#039;t line up with that at all. It wasn&#039;t until I go home and saw all my baggies were empty that it all made sense and I knew I had plugged 85mg of alprazolam vs. the powdered remains of a last MDMA pill.<br /><br />So ladies and gents, label your drugs. I was a total moron which is quite obvious if you have read through this. I hesitated to even mention it because I felt like such a tool but we are all here to look out for each other and hopefully learn from one another&#039;s mistakes and well this one was a doozy!

Walking was a chore and a half and I couldn&#039;t come to terms with how I could still be fucked up off a few bumps of MDMA. It honestly took me until I got home to figure it out. I couldn&#039;t even fathom that amount to alprazolam I had taken, at .5mg - 1mg I am pretty fucked up. I guess everyone has their time to go and for whatever reason my number wasn&#039;t up yet.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be damned though if I ever get alprazolam powder again and don&#039;t put it in a red vial with a skull and cross bones on it, duct taped sealed and locked in a box only my wife has the combination to though. I thought I had pushed my luck before but that was out of this world stupid. My honest to go though was that I had crushed up an MDMA pill for plugging and just forgot to load it all into the oral syringe. Prior to passing out moments later I was all excited I was going to get another little roll out of the night...<br /><br />FREAKING RETARTED!

				I&#039;m surprised your heart didn&#039;t stop or you just stopped breathing, that is a huge fucking dose that would possibly kill a bull... Glad you made it through though, be more careful next time!

				Glad you&#039;re alive to to tell the tale.&nbsp; It&#039;s good advice to always label your shit.&nbsp; Too many people fail to label properly because in most cases these substances are illegal.&nbsp; In my view, one must balance the real or perceived legal risks with safety and I believe there is room for judgment.&nbsp; For example, not labeling cocaine or MDMA is far less risky than not labeling powdered alprazolam, which is a really really bad idea that puts oneself and others at risk.&nbsp; Anyway, glad you shared this lesson with the group.

				Wow, rough! Stories like these are the only thing keeping me from ordering from some of the alp powder vendors on here. Glad you are ok. <br /><br />On a side note, how is plugging mdma? I&#039;ve almost exclusively eaten caps (reagent tested, normal dose ~150mg), rarely snorted (found it was a waste really). I&#039;d imagine plugging kicks in much quicker.

				Yeah, when I got my powdered Alprazolam the first thing I did was take a sharpie to each side with &quot;DO NOT CONSUME&quot;.&nbsp; Since most of my baggies look similar I figured that was a great way to not accidentally perform the same maneuver you just survived.

				It was just one wild and crazy ride. I think this is where the whole being honest thing works for me. My wife knew where I was, my girlfriend had her number, they were able to talk while I flopped around and OD&#039;d for a day and we all get a chuckle out of it once it&#039;s all over. Next time I get the Xanax powder though I am going to cap that stuff and lock away the powder when I&#039;m high. Even if I am sober enough to recognize what I am taking, measuring out .5 mg of anything when you are high is just stupid and potentially mixing up one white powder for another is lame.<br /><br />The good news is the girlfriend really liked the MDMA and can&#039;t wait to come over and do it with the wife and I. She was 100% terrified of hard drugs before that night and now she&#039;s all about it even with my watch me shove a lethal dose of Xanax up my ass show. Well it wasn&#039;t actually lethal... only way I could have been really fucked up by it is if I passed out on my back and puked but fortunately the girls were smart enough to keep me on my side for the duration.<br /><br />Appreciate everyone being nice on this thread. I figured people would just call me a dumbass, which of course I was, but I figured the story was worth telling since in my day to day life I would never fuck up like that. Hopefully it keeps some poor soul out there from making the same sort of mistake.

				The opening post had me chuckle for a bit... I can imagine how something like this would happen, and luckily it turned out quite well in this case.<br /><br />You got away very well since benzo&#039;s aren&#039;t actually that dangerous in enormous amounts, apart from putting you out for quite some time. 40 mg of xanax will not kill a bull (it will sleep well, however), not will it kill a man. Combined with alcohol there is a danger of respiratory depression, but on its own it&#039;s not life threatening. <br /><br />I suppose labeling stuff is the lesson learned here. If you had mistaken another substance the results could have been far worse - you might has well have mistakenly put a gram of heroin up your bottom, and if that were the case, chances are you would not be posting about it. <br /><br />Making a mistake like you did is something that can happen to anyone - don&#039;t feel dumb for it, just make sure it will never happen again.
