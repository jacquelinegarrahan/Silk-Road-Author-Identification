				Hey all, looking to get some scales that are able to measure 0.001g (mainly for 2C-B so between 15-30mgs)<br /><br />looking to get these for around £40<br /><br />http://www.americanweigh.com/product_info.php?products_id=580<br /><br />any advice/comments on these or could you recommend a better item? Im aware good scales are above £100 but looking to keep it under 60 if possible.<br /><br />Thanks in advanced!

				I would recommend getting a pricier scale.&nbsp; I&nbsp; understand you wanna keep it under a certain amount, but it is just more ideal to get a scale that you know is trustworthy than one that could be inaccurate to the milligram.

				I have that same exact AW Gemini-20 scale and it works well for the price.<br /><br />It comes with a 10G weight which weighs 10.016 on the scale and most orders I bought off SR weighs 1-3% less than what I ordered which is close enough for me. If you don&#039;t actually need precise measurements down to the .00x then this one should be fine. If you need it to be spot-on accurate then maybe someone else can make a better recommendation.

				I had a great milligram scale for sale on SR but I just sold it. I am going to be selling American Weigh scales as soon has I can get vendor status with them so I can buy them wholesale. The scale I was selling for $80 bucks was a good scale but anything cheaper than that and it won&#039;t weigh worth a shit.<br /><br />Send me a PM if anyone is looking for a good scale.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				The Gemini-20 works great. Ive tested it against professional scales that I have access to and the variance is always less than .002g. Most of the time its .001 or nothing at all.

				thanks guys think i will go with the Gemini 20, And about buying gel caps being suspicious, they have alot of legal uses for herbs and diet supplements so in my opinion dont believe anyone would be looking at them unless you purchase some crazy amounts.

				Yeah i got gel caps and .001 scales from amazon for very very very cheap. also a surplus of little dope baggies. <br /><br />I believe these suppliers and sites are in it for the money. A ginseng/supplement dealer on amazon would not think much about sending out gel caps, as its what they are in business to do every day.&nbsp; Same with scales. Amazon is wanting to sell them, lists them, hopes you buy them and come back for more.&nbsp; Working with leo to bust the clients they have would be bad for business.

				that gemini-20 scale is gonna get you killed if you&#039;re doing anything with an ed50 below 100mg. and it doesn&#039;t even work right out of the box, you need to alter the tray for it to weigh more accurately...

				For $80 &quot;American Weigh GPR-20 Gemini-PRO Digital Milligram Scale, 20 by 0.001 G&quot; is the one I use. Best bang for the buck, and every measure has been a consistent weight (no floating values). I&#039;ve weighed their calibration 10g weights on a $1600 scale at work, and they are ~0.01g off each.&nbsp; For things like MDMA and the 2C-Xs, I&#039;d say this scale is adequate it if you can live or survive +/1 3mg rate of error.&nbsp; I would say it is borderline useable for the Xanax powder for example (2mg?).<br /><br />For the pebble heroin, really any thing where 1mg or less is near or over the LD50, I&#039;d say you better be ready to spend a lot more money.<br /><br />Edit: Always make sure you are on as flat a surface as you can be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never use the batteries, plug it into a 6v DC adapter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This version is much improved on the original Gemini 20.&nbsp; So soldering of pennies or washers needed.

				I use this one and it seems accurate enough. Obviously a thousand dollar scale will be better, but unless you need greater than .003 accuracy it will get the job done.

				i&#039;ve used the gemini 20 scale for about a month and have not had it fuck me over yet. it&#039;s only ever been off by ~5mg once and then i was able to recalibrate it back to a spot on reading. the calibration is actually super easy.

				that gemini scale ( I believe the one where they recommend that you put a dime on it) is not very good. I purchased the one above that, it retails for around 200 bucks and it used to sale on amazon for 55 bucks, now its almost a hundred. But, when your dealing with .001 resolution you get what you pay for. Also remember, to use it away from all computers, cell phones, tv&#039;s etc. and get some test weights, After calibration, i have a 10mg weight all the way up to 10grams. I&#039;ve seen it be off by only a couple milligrams at the most..<br /><br />Its worth it to pay a little extra to get a good one... But that gemini one that needs a dime to make it work should be avoided...

				Really people, can&#039;t fool around with crappy stuff. I bought this scale and it does the job well. The slightest breath I make will cause drift, and that&#039;s why it has a cover which you can close down. <br /><br />http://www.scalesgalore.com/sartorius_m_prove.cfm<br /><br />I got the AY123. Probably the most professional you&#039;ll get at the price range. AC adapter, level bubble, calibration weight, pan, wind guard, everything you need.
