				2c-b is amazing<br />My preferred dose is 30-35mg. I would try more I&#039;ve just yet to have time. I&#039;ve taken 20mg but it just didn&#039;t get me where I want to be.

				I am still pretty new to 2c-b, first time was only about 2 months ago with 1.5 of the beez envious was selling, and I have only had it 4 times since from other vendors ~30mg each time (the beez were strongest) and so far I am not sold on it as a stand alone drug. Now when I mixed it up with some 4-aco-det I had a blast, and when I added methylone to it was great also, but the other three times it was just 2c-b and it just feels like it is missing something. It is hard to describe what I want out of it, but I guess I could call it an emotional component. For me, most psychedelics are extremely emotional, but lack in the visuals. 2c-b was quite the opposite, with 95% of the effects being visual and 5% being body high with no discernible emotional response. I really do like the short duration of the trip, and that is why I will continue to use it (I am always looking for short duration psychedelics to ward off boring ass Wednesday evenings while allowing me to still get some sleep for early Thursday meetings). I will probably continue to mix it with other short acting chems until I get bored with it (could take months to bore of the visuals). Overall, I suggest adding 4-aco or shrooms or something else to the 2c-b experience to round out the trip, but that is just my opinion.

				I took 2cb for the first time and it was my first time using any psychedelic ever. I took 25mg.&nbsp; For me the expectation was I would be out of my mind for a little while and wouldn&#039;t be able to communicate with others. My worst fear was that I would do something crazy or have a panic attack. But nothing even close to that happened. I was very clear headed. I could communicate normal and could even hang around other people without them even knowing I was high. I felt very in control. It felt like I had mind powers the way I was able to concentrate in and out of the visuals.&nbsp; I liked looking at the snow in my backyard and the carpet in my living room; the way it morphed and melted and moved in waves was really fascinating. Overall it was a very fun and playful experience. Not scary at all. No sitter needed, at least as long as you don&#039;t take too much. For me 25mg was easy to handle and very fun. I look forward to trying it again.

				I tried 2C-B a while back and it was a lot of fun, just don&#039;t eyeball doses or try to insufflate it the first time. It doesn&#039;t end very well if you aren&#039;t experienced with very strong trips and a bad tasting drip. I felt an oral dose around 20-25mg was nice and colors seemed to morph a bit and it was somewhat euphoric. Insufflation was a whole &#039;nother ball game though, within 5-15 minutes you come up pretty hard and in my case walls started breathing, everything in the room started to flash in a different color spectrum. I had a pretty hard time communicating because I was too distracted by everything going on with my senses. Just be careful how much you take and how you take it!

				Forgive me if I have already gone over this in another thread. I found that 18mg of 2C-B is a comfortable amount to take - the last couple of times I have taken 28 mg and gotten a bit sick feeling for about 1,5 - 2 hrs(upset stomach). the 1st 3 times I tried it I took 18 mg, which produced the desired visuals (same intensity of visuals the 28 mg did), but without the sick stomach ache / dry heaves of the higher amounts. I still have 3 28mg capsules left, and I plan on weighing out 2/3rds of that amount &amp; trying that (which would be around 18-20 mg). Has anyone else had the sick tummy effect from the higher amounts? I really do not suffer from a weak stomach (I eat lots of Thai and Mexican food, also straight halopeno peppers with no ill effects (unless I eat a SHITLOAD of peppers). I took some Pepto Bismol for thw upset stomach (from&nbsp; 2C-B, not the peppers), but it did not help - I had to wait for 1,5 or 2 hrs, then the sickness passed. I did not use any cannabis whiletaking the higher amounts of 2CB, does anyone think that would have helped?

				I know it may sound crazy, but I&#039;ve done 2C-B everyway you can think of, and honestly the best way rectal. This method elliminates the harsh come-up of nasal, or stomache discomfort from oral. It really isn&#039;t as bad as at sounds. Go ahead I won&#039;t judge you.

				This rectal thing (it IS called plugging, right?) sounds interesting, esp with the 2C-B - if it can avoid the sick stomach thing I&#039;m willing to give it a shot. Should I use a bit of warm water with it to help it dissolve? Or perhaps KY jelly? I&#039;ve used rectal valium before (it camy from the pharmacy in that package - it was for children experiencing siezures, but works well just for a buzz once you get over the thing up the ass bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\

You can use a little lube on the syringe if you want. You only want to insert about an inch. About the length of two knuckles. <br />I have done this a bunch of times and never had any side effects. The come-up is still kinda fast like sniffing, but it feels much more gentle. I never had any stomache discomfort with this method either.
