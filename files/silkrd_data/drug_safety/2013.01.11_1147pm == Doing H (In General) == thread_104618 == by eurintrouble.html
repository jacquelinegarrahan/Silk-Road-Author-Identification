				Hi all,<br /><br />Most of the last three years has involved me taking opiate drugs. I started on Codeine, then on to Tramadol - and then once I was so hooked on Tramadol I could only feel a &#039;high&#039; from an OC Oxy 80mg. Some people say trams are weak as shit but I&#039;ve been nodding when I&#039;ve been having 1000mg+ of that stuff... I know that&#039;s not a good thing though.<br /><br />Anyway I have acquired myself with 1 gram of H. I have zilt experience with needles so I do not how to induce the drug other than smoking or snorting. I will snort it, I have decided.<br /><br />Past Experience: Lots of cocaine, and sometimes heavy prescription opiate use. <br /><br />However, I have one question on my mind. How much of a difference is there between popping oxycodone 80mg tablets than there is snorting H? Will it be that much different for me? After research, I know only to take very small bumps of H and certainly will commit to that - but will there be any differences between Oxy and Heroin? I imagine so of course, but I do wonder at what dosages become similar, since I have a gram of H and have previously been taking 80mg Oxys.<br /><br />Any knowledge from you fellow SR users would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />M

				If you have a high tolerance it can take more than one would think.&nbsp; the 2 of us can run through a gram in an evening snorting.&nbsp;
