				Hello, my best of friends :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought I&#039;d take a moment to write a little story about a rather interesting experience I went though last Saturday.&nbsp; Soooo, here goes. <br /><br />Me and the girlyfriend got a pretty decent amount of mdma this past week and right on Saturday, after 14 some odd days waiting, my little package of MIMM&#039;s 1G ketamine showed up at the house.&nbsp; Yay, time to party-we went to a decent sized rave party where I had about a quarter oz of said mdma all bagged up.&nbsp; Me and the g.f. decided to sit on the K till we got home, or the next day.&nbsp; She left before me with some friends, and while I was bagging up all this molly I couldn&#039;t help but keep staring at it.&nbsp; It was just sitting there on a plate, looking all pretty like (this was the first time I&#039;ve ever gotten K off the SR, and it was absolutely gorgeous-better than anything I&#039;ve ever seen).&nbsp; SOOOOO, instead of being patient-I snorted a tenth of the fucking shit and went back to bagging out this molly.&nbsp; FUCK, that got difficult.&nbsp; Anyways, about half a hour later I made the drive on down there and took some shots in the car when I arrived. (fuck paying $6.00 a shot!)&nbsp; I had the K on me, in a separate pocket, in two bags so I didn&#039;t get the MDMA and the K confused.<br /><br />So, here I am-sitting in this show and have all this work on me.&nbsp; See some people I know-sell a few grams and was actually pretty intoxicated within 20 minutes of arriving.&nbsp; It was at that point where I decided to do some more K, against my better judgement.&nbsp; Well, my dumbass decided to stick a bill into the whole fucking bag.&nbsp; BAD IDEA!!!!!!!&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a K-hole would be appropriate to describe what occurred-lets try K-ROCK.&nbsp; I completely blacked out, had my molly sacks all over the fucking place-and had to be taken care of by my friends and my g.f.&nbsp; Here I am, drooling all over myself-TOUCHING ON ANOTHER GIRL THINKING SHE WAS MY GIRLFRIEND-and dropping my drugs and money.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a complete shitshow, and I don&#039;t remember a fucking thing.&nbsp; I wake up to driving to a friends, with a huge headache, and missing most of my shit (R.I.P. my little laser pointer and my favorite hat).&nbsp; When I came back to, I was just sitting on the couch at a friends-driven home by another friend-and being told about what had just conspired.&nbsp; It was literally, to this point, the most embarrassing event that has ever happened in my life.&nbsp; (Even when I was on heroin back in the day and went to the ER after falling out in a public bathroom-least I didn&#039;t know anybody who found me and never went back there)<br /><br />Anyways, I learned a lot last Saturday and I thought I&#039;d share this with you in hopes that other people are very mindful about their dosages-I could have easily wound up robbed, arrested, broke bones, raped-who the fuck knows-and that&#039;s a very, very scary state of mind to be in!&nbsp; <br /><br />tl;dr-<br />1. Never underestimate the STRENGTH of your drugs, especially one&#039;s you get off SR as they tend to be more pure than most can get in their local markets<br />2. Be mindful of DOSAGES, always test out your product with a small amount before going all in.<br />3. Be aware of your ENVIRONMENT-some drugs are just not appropriate for certain places<br />4. RESPECT Your body, mind, and friends/romantic partner.&nbsp; If you fall out, they gotta take care of you and it fucks with their night and makes you look like an idiot that can&#039;t handle their shit.<br /><br /><br />I am nor an addict, an immature kid, or inexperienced with most any substance.&nbsp; However, that night I let bad judgement cloud my mind and made a really stupid decision which I regret like a motherfucker.&nbsp; And since I can&#039;t really post this on any social media or tell most of my friends about it, I thought that I&#039;d just leave this here in hopes that my story may prevent someone else from making the same mistake as me.&nbsp; I got very lucky, but if this were to happen again I bet it would turn out bad. <br />

				+1&#039;d you, Rat.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing such a personal story. <br /><br />It&#039;s a good lesson to others out there to be careful at all times, especially when you&#039;re on droogs.<br /><br />You never know what&#039;s gonna happen when you go overboard.. usually, &#039;you&#039;re gonna have a bad time&#039;

				Heh, I have been there! K has made me completely black out a few times (amusing for the people that got to observe me), especially when combined with alcohol, I am sure the shots amplified your reaction. My funniest K related story is certainly my drunk friend calling us a cab, opening the door and throwing himself face down into the back seat, legs sticking out of the cab, yelling &quot;I WANT TO GO IN THE K HOLE!&quot; I am certain that cab driver loved us. At least we tipped well.
