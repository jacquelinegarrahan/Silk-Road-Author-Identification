				I&#039;ve recently been researching a bit all over the web since this is an awesome debate to discuss while high independently of the people I&#039;m with since it generates a lot of arguments and opinions, and since i was high while researching i remembered of my favorite pot smoking community right here on the dark corner of the webz Silkroad to start this debate once again.<br /><br />IMHO the most economic and healthy method of inhaling is through a vaporizer since the vaporizer uses less weed to provide the same high as bong&#039;s or joints since it burns the weed at the right temperature and no smoke is left for the air &quot;to smoke&quot;, on the healthy side i gotta point at a study (http://www.ukcia.org/research/pipes.php) to prove my views vaporizer is still the most healthy since the cannabinoid/tar ratio is 25% higher than the unfiltered joint, with the joint having&nbsp; 1 part cannabinoids to 13 parts tar.<br /><br />On this side the vap is way better but as a bong smoker i can&#039;t leave the taste and clean toke i get from a bong behind since it&#039;s the way it gives me most pleasure but that&#039;s not what is being discussed, so in your opinion:<br /><br />What&#039;s worst for ur Health and most Economic method: Joint vs Bong vs Vaporizer?<br /><br /><br /><br />Much love <br />Anon

				I suppose a vaporizer is the most efficient method but it can be a bitch to clean. It also produces a more &#039;high&#039; effect than smoking with tobacco. But then again joints are easier on the god and somehow also more social if you ask me.<br /><br />It all depends on your goals....

				I&#039;d say if you&#039;re trying to be economical, go get yourself a one-hitter. It&#039;ll really strech your weed out and make it last. On the other hand, if you&#039;re concerned about health issues, a vaporizer is the way to go. However, I find that the high with a vaporizer just doesnt pack the same punch as burning regular weed, because you&#039;re not getting all the cannabinoids. Vaporizing concentrates is a good solution to this problem. Gets you blasted and is good for your lungs. <br /><br />Bongs are pretty healthy too, but they do tend to burn thru your weed pretty fast. But they sure do get you loaded tho! ;D And I gotta agree, joints (and blunts) are the most social. Pass it around!

				The true winner is BHO. So potent you need to inhale very little vapor, and a dab a day goes a long way.<br /><br />It&#039;s the most stealth, too, especially with those new dab pen vaporizers like the Atmos W. I&#039;ll never go back.<br /><br />With vaporized weed, however, you can use the spent fuel to bake pot brownies. Lots of posts in here about unique ways people re-use their vaporized weed, so as far as economics go, you may get more THC-per-dollar if you go this route.

				In order, from healthiest to least healthy:<br />Vaporization, water-filtered combustion (bong), and then un-filtered combustion (joint).<br /><br />Most economic is arguably vaporization, but I&#039;d like to think concentrates are the most economic depending on the price you get them.

				I&#039;d vote for joint but because its the most practical solution rather than any of the other options.<br /><br />You can easily fashion a joint out of weed, some tobacco and rolling paper, using part if the rolling paper box as a stopper. <br /><br />A bong or vaporizer may be more effective for the frequent user, but for those that smoke a bit of cannabis once in a while the joint is probably just the simplest solution to a problem ;)
