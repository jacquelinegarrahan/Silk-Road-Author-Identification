				I would have to say no, If anything, id compare a strong opiate high to that of a strong MDMA high. <br /><br />Wanting to keep the eyes closed and have pleasant dope dreams, in and out of coherence, very warm core feeling..<br /><br />Maybe as to the numbness of the mind and body, yes the two are similar in that aspect.

				LOL.. <br /><br />@Cereal, every ones different dude, to each his own, ya know.<br /><br />@Joy, Its almost like Leary said about LSD, trust your nervous system, if you can panic, than your ok. lol<br />Im not much of an Opiate expert, but im sure that on OD of H or any strong rx opiate, can lead to you not breathing, lol.. but its highly unlikely if you stay safe, read alot, dose proper, and learn the substance for your self over time.<br /><br />K on the other hand, will not, no matter how much you bang/eat/snort, and can not stop your respiratory system. That is the exact reason why it is/was used for medical reasons, surgery and what not. <br /><br />Look lets make this easier for every one here, what are you looking into trying out, that your skeptic about?

				One of the things I&#039;ve learned about dissociatives is there are no bad trips. either you love it or you hate it. i don&#039;t know if it&#039;s some sort of genetic brain chemistry thing or some weird psychological thing. but people who don&#039;t like it just categorically dont like it.

				Yes , true. I think its because those are the type of people that would rather pop an adderal, or do a line of blow, or meth. <br /><br />Or the kind of ego maniacs that would never voluntarily submit them selves to a point of total helplessness.<br /><br />Also, thing about KitKit, is that how diverse it is, from portion weight , to the amount of time in between booster doses. Ive been doing K over a decade now, and i would be lying if i said that any 2 trips where alike. <br /><br />It always has the same effect, but with literally dozens of tiers, untill you reach the final frontier, the HOLE.

				Hi guys.<br /><br />I have been using Ketamine for over 4 years now (whoops) and just wanted to point out you shouldn&#039;t be so complacent about this drug.<br /><br />I believe the potential for breathing failure is possibly quite high. I have visited A &amp; E a few times which chest pains and breathing issues. I spoke openly with the paramedics about Ketamine who advised you are playing roulette with your life when you continually take Ketamine; the potential for depression of the respiratory system can be high. They were quite keen to advise that if you continue to use, each time your respiratory takes a bashing that could eventually leave it to get so slowed down it could just stop.<br /><br />More than a bunch of times I have come out of a K hole or whilst in the K hole had to properly concentrate on remembering to breath! This could all be panic and anxiety however but I just wanted to put it out there.<br /><br />I know each time i inject this drug that i&#039;m playing with fire but I just cant get enough of that feeling. I think I might start a thread on the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of ketamine and see what people are saying.<br /><br />I have also seen and heard a lot about ketamine bladder syndrome. Fucked up bladders due to so much crystal in the body. JUST STAY SUPER HYDRATED AND EAT FRESH FRUIT AND VEG PEEPS<br /><br />&nbsp;:P

				i don&#039;t find the highs similar at all. the only similarity, really, is the analgesic effect. they both numb the body, but ketamine has much more interesting effects on the mind. it&#039;s a very unique psychedelic/dissociative anesthetic.

				Hmm, my first batch is set to arrive any day this week, never tried it<br /><br />But from what my family has told me (siblings use it frequently), there is an essence of &quot;helplessness&quot; in the dissociative state, but the key element is it fucking relaxes you and takes the anxiety completely out of the equation. You&#039;re helpless, but you don&#039;t care, because everything is amazing and tranquil.<br /><br />I personally can&#039;t fucking wait to K-Hole with some LSD. Goddamn.
