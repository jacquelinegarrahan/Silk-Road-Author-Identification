				Hey Everyone,<br />&nbsp; I thought I would post a chart for anyone curious on how to properly dose on MDMA. I did not create the chart but it is based on Shuligan Pihkal - 109. The recommendations are sound and seem to produce the best effects with the least amount of hangover. It is worth noting that two doses should be used. An initial does and a booster after 1.5 hours of taking initial dose. It is worth noting the booster is taken 1.5 hours after dose and not 1.5 hours after effects are felt. For the math guys out there dosing is 1.5mg/kg initial and .5mg/kg booster<br /><br />Dosages by weight, including booster.<br />Weight lb.&nbsp; Kg &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Initial&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booster &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Dose<br />90lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40.9Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 61mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 82mg<br />100lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45.5Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 68mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 91mg<br />110lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50.0Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 75mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100mg<br />120lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 54.5Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 82mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109mg<br />130lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59.1Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 89mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 119mg<br />140lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 63.6Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 127mg<br />150lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 68.2Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 102mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 136mg<br />160lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 72.7Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 145mg<br />170lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77.3Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 116mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 155mg<br />180lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 81.8Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 123mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 41mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 164mg<br />190lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 86.4Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 130mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 43mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 173mg<br />200lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90.9Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 136mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 181mg<br />210lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95.5Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 143mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 191mg<br />220lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100.0Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200mg<br />230lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 104.5Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 157mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 209mg<br />240lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109.1Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 164mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 219mg<br />250lb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 113.6Kg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 170mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 57mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 227mg<br /><br /><br />--EDIT--<br />Some other points worth mentioning: The table above assumes pure MDMA.&nbsp; I&nbsp; think most molly falls into the &gt;75% range here at SR, dose should be adjusted as necessary. For reference most pills contain between 100-150mg MDMA most commonly on the lower end between 100-125mg<br /><br />

				So would this apply for a first time (or first few times only)? <br /><br />Because I cannot imagine myself being able to roll with just taking 100mg (I weigh 51-53kg) at this stage.<br /><br />Surely like with everything else, there will be increasing tolerance. As the &quot;magic&quot; disappears, the only way to win some of it back is by taking more.<br /><br />Either this guide is on the low side, or else I&#039;m a pig - because I&#039;ve taken more than twice the recommended dose, and I&#039;ve known people to FAR exceed anything on that chart.

				House:<br />&nbsp; Purity and exp certainly play a roll in dosage. If one is at the point of having to take massive doses to achieve a decent roll it is probably time switch out MDMA for another favored psychedelic for some time. IIRC overdose / toxic levels for humans is close to 3 grams (citation needed) so it is possible to take a very large dose without setting a meeting with St Peter, although doses over the levels recommended above have diminishing returns and greatly exasperate side effect symptoms. <br />&nbsp; Personally I weigh 200 pds, my preferred dose 160/50, total dose 210mg, about 15% over recommended. I also allow almost 2 months between sessions. <br />&nbsp; A simple anaology. View your brain as a sponge soaked in water. A proper squeeze will wring the sponge of a majority of the absorbed water with very little effort. The Sponge will spring back and be none the worse for wear. Sure you could go ape shit on the sponge and get out every last drop, but what would that do to the sponge?<br /><br />---EDIT---<br />After reviewing my notes I had to update the chart above. Dosages listed above assume 100% MDMA. Amount of molly consumed should be adjusted for purity. For ex, 75% pure Molly should increase dose by 25%.<br />

				Do people who suffer from chronic depression have to take more? <br /><br />For my first mdma experience, I took 100 mg, waited an hour, got no buzz, took another 100 mg and still got zero buzz. The vendor seems to have reputable product according to other patrons.

				Hi Tom:<br />&nbsp; It depends on the depression and more so on any medication you may be taking to combat depression. <br /><br />First, if you are currently taking an SSRI then you will be unable to have any effect from MDMA and you also risk seratonin syndrome, which is possibly life threatening. It has been postulated that users with a lengthy past history of using an SSRI or MAOI may have their receptors&nbsp; permanently modified to the point that MDMA will no longer bind.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are currently on anti-depressants you would need to stop medicating. Prozac, by far the most commonly prescribed unfortunately has the longest half life. A min of 30 days would be needed in an otherwise healthy individual, <br /><br />If you are diagnosed as depressed and not on medication it would depend on how your brain chemistry differs from that of a non depressed individual. To borrow from my sponge analogy earlier: Your sponge may hold less water. But it still holds water so you should have some type of effect. <br /><br />My guess is either you are currently on anti-depressants, are only recently off of them or had porr quality MDMA.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yes I am on anti-depressants at the moment, I had not suspected they were the reason for lack of a buzz.<br /><br />I also tried one DEFQON ecstasy pill from schizofreen recently this past weekend and all it did was make me break a sweat so I don&#039;t think it was poor quality products from two completely different vendors.<br /><br />Thanks for your input, you were very helpful.

				Keep in mind that his dosing strategies were for therapeutic work. <br /><br />I find that recreational use demands a little bit higher dose. <br /><br />The golden standard of 120mg + 40mg booster seems to be ideal for regular-sized people.
