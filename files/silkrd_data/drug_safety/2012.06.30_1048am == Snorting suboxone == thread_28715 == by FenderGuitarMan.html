				OK I am really, really confused. All the propaganda and gov&#039;t info says you can&#039;t snort these. Yet I see messages from ppl all the time saying they do. I have scoured the web and still feel confused. I am not talking about straight Bupe like subutex, I&#039;m talking the suboxone tabs. I usually have strips which work great under the tongue. But ended up with a large number of pills due to a pharmacy screwup and interested in getting to the bottom of this. Even asked my own doc but he just spouted the manufacturer/gov&#039;t info saying you can&#039;t because of the naloxone.<br /><br />I troed a small amount, like 1mg, and it certainly didn&#039;t send me into W/D. It seems like I got a different effect than under the tongue.<br /><br />Yes, yes I know. I&#039;m using subs to get clean. Not really though. I&#039;m using them to trade the need for obtaining illegal drugs with legal drugs. I still have serious pain and I still like a little opiate buzz! I often go off the subs when I need surgery or want a little stronger meds. I have a general protocol for that: taper down to smallest dose and then wait until you feel discomfort from W/D. Wait a few more hours and go. Go small the first day to let the bupe release its grip then party away second day after stopping subs. But I digress...<br /><br />Snorting suboxone tabs Yea or Nay

				the question i guess depends on your habit ;)&nbsp; if you got no habit, then yeah snort em, youll get high as fuck.&nbsp; and&nbsp; ive found that if you just have a little habit you can snort like 1-2mg and not go into wds,&nbsp; but if you have a large habit (50-100 bucks a day worth habit ;) then you will probably send yourself into wds if you snort any subs within like 24 hrs of last getting high.&nbsp; of course everyones body chemistry is different, but from what i have seen this seems to hold true.

				Yes, as he said.<br /><br />Depends on whether you&#039;re addicted to full agonists or not.<br /><br />Snorting vs normal sublingual administration does not have any impact on whether you&#039;ll get precipitated withdrawals or not. The naloxone is not effective unless injected. And even then, buprenorphine&#039;s own affinity is so high that the naloxone just can&#039;t compete. That&#039;s why people can shoot suboxone without going into precipitated WD&#039;s<br /><br />So - if you&#039;re already on bupe, go ahead and snort away.<br /><br />(as an aside: the generic bupe pills are harder to crush than the brand name ones. Get the brand name ones if you want to snort)

				Thanks for the responses. I WAS addicted to OCs before I went on Suboxone. Now I&#039;m addicted to suboxone! So am I already taking them. Maybe I&#039;ll give it a try for kicks.

				don&#039;t do it.. this is coming from a H addict to suboxone and back to H now..<br /><br />As soon as I started snorting suboxone it just got 100x worse my tolerance went up and I started to feel more of the negative effects of suboxone..<br /><br />and yes you can shoot brand name suboxone and snort it no problems at all, the naloxone was added just to make the FDA happy

				thanks for the advice Opi. the LAST think I need is for my tolerance to increase! That&#039;s an important perspective.

				if you snort them just make sure to not snort very hard and let the drip go through. that way it will mostly just go into your stomach and not get absorbed correctly. if you snort it lightly and let it sit in your nostrils for about 15 minutes or so it will absorb the same way it absorbs sublingually.

				So for someone with no opiate tolerance snorting 1mg of Suboxone will get them wasted. I assume 1mg under the tongue will also do the same, yes?

Buprenorphine is pretty strong. Snorting it won&#039;t get you really higher according to its bioavailability but it will hit you faster and harder.

				I used to be prescribed 8 mg suboxone a day. I figured out I could snort 2-4 mg a day and feel just as good(as if i took 8mg sublingually) for the next 24 hours util my next dose. After several months I accumulated hundreds of suboxone and someone offfered me 2 dollars apiece and I&#039;m like hells yea take them theyre worthless to me!<br />the next month i discovered SR and how much theyre worth and now i feel like an idiot..

I take morph and oxy but not too regularly. <br /><br />Yes, the prices for prescription meds is ridiculously high from some vendors on SR. Like 37 cent oxies sold for $40!!! 13 cent vallies sold for $9!!!!<br /><br />I think you sold them at a fair prices if it&#039;s any consolation :)
