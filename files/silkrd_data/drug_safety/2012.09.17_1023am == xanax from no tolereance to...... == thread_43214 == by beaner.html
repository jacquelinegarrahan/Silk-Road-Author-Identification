				10mg of xanax per dose? whether it is weak grade or not you are really playing with fire... you are playing with your life. <br /><br />you are on the verge of having a very serious life threatening addiction. i would be getting professional advice on this asap. you need to cut down on the xanax but only after speaking to a medical professional - as in start making calls right now.<br /><br />if you are doing this recreationaly you should be staggering out your doses by many days, weekly might be fine.<br /><br />most likely you lost your tolerance in the first few days.<br /><br />

				10 mg is a huge ass dose. Even if thats throughout a day, that is a huge daily dose. You should do what ^he said, consult an expert cause no one should be taking that much on the regular. Thats way too much homie.

				you can definitely develop a tolerance to benzos in three weeks time<br />especially one that won&#039;t get you &#039;high&#039; off 10mg<br />DONT STOP TAKING IT ABRUPTLY! Whatever you have left, you should really tapering off or you&#039;re gonna have one super shitty time<br />See if you can get yourself some valium.. its half life is very long and it will stay in your system far longer than xanax (ie you will come down easier)<br /><br />benzo addiction is brutal<br />I was taking ativan for anxiety (not to get high) and when I came off of it... it really sucked, even with tapering

				Hope you are being serious about getting help.<br /><br />10mg+ of xanax or any benzo taken 2-5 times the recommended dose everyday or even couple times a week for even a couple months will really fuck you up.<br />It is basically living a dream to shooting back into reality and the change is such a shock that people always slip back.<br /><br />I just had a strong relapse with Bionik&#039;s onax bars with my bad benzo habits.&nbsp; I got 100 and in about&nbsp; 3-4 days(can&#039;t even remember) I had none left....yeah I&#039;m retarded.&nbsp; &nbsp; That is how I used to be almost everyday for a year...along with valiums.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first night I got Bionik&#039;s onax bars I was really excited since it was like after a 2 month benzo break.&nbsp; Popped 6-8 bars and I woke up slouching on my computer chair...I passed out for HOURS.&nbsp; When they were all gone the withdrawal symptoms were already there.&nbsp; No motivations, no appettite, constant fidgeting, restlessness, felt like shit.&nbsp; Now about 2 weeks later I am feeling a bit better.... :-[ This is 100 was supposed to last well over a month, gone in less than a fucking week.&nbsp; Benzos are no joke. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m just curious, why are people taking benzos &quot;recreationally&quot;? All they do is make you feel calm and reduce your anxiety, you can&#039;t get high off them, if you have no tolerance and you take too much, you&#039;ll either walk around bumping into things, knocking shit over, or just falling asleep, so why are people taking them without a medical reason? I just don&#039;t understand, are you guys getting some special benzos that i&#039;ve never heard of? I&#039;ve tried valium, xanax, klonopin, I can&#039;t tell the difference between them but my tolerance built up fast. I went from taking 1-2 a day, to taking 8 per day (2x 4), but after experiencing an MDMA comedown for the first time ever, I don&#039;t want to experience anything like that again, so i&#039;m going to try and taper down on them, only take when needed etc. <br />

				^I agree, any euphoria that is experienced comes with the pure relief from anxiety, people who have no anxiety whatsoever probably wouldn&#039;t be too interested in benzos recreationally.&nbsp; I only seek them out if I&#039;m hungover, took to much adderall, or am just very anxious, but if I&#039;m feeling good and am simply bored I would not look to benzos to cure boredom whatsoever.&nbsp; They are pretty fun to drink on, but thats a silly thing to do.<br /><br />I had a week long xanax withdrawal a while back and it was absolute hell. Basically the effects that benzos cure to the extreme severe anxiety 24/7, REDICULOUS insomnia, etc. Its no fun.

				The recreational value of benzo&#039;s escaped me as well - for me they are purely therapeutic medications that help dealing with anxiety or insomnia, and hard to obtain legally in most of the western world.<br /><br />The recreational value of a drug like xanax is very limited - i may give you a bit of a drunk buzz if you are not used to it, but don&#039;t expect this effect to be larger than drinking a bottle of wine.<br /><br />I suppose the main reason of things like xanax being popular is their ability to end band trips fairly quickly. This could be of great value to people experimenting with hallucinogens.<br /><br />So, some people will order these to cope with everyday anxiety issues whereas others may order them as a precaution to have available for a trip gone bad. These audiences are completely different, but tend to order the same substance either way.&nbsp;

				A few years back I bought a bottle of bars and took more than half over the next 30 days. I realized life would be hell if i just stopped (a friend had seizures and was bakeracted for a few days while stopping his xanax habit cold turkey... he thought he was in a different place, hard to explain) so i tapered off over the next 60 days. Even with that, there were a few days there I thought i&#039;d have a panic attack.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t use benzos unless i&#039;m coming off blow, or just need help sleeping real well, or sometimes&nbsp; if i&#039;m going to be in a huge social setting that might make me anxious. But for those last two things I take low doses, like .5-1mg and i&#039;m set. For coming off blow, 2mg-3mg depending how long i&#039;ve binged for, and how high/low my blow tolerance is at the time.

That is an absurdly high dose, how do you even acquire than much xanax? Thats 20 bars every single day... Are you sure you have that mg right? Cause this is serious, life threatening shit. 40 mg of Alprazolam? Every day?<br /><br />Anyway, you need to taper slowly at that kind of dose. The slower the better really, find a doctor who knows what the fuck hes doing and get on a strict taper schedule. Its gonna take a long time to do properly at such a crazy high daily dose.<br /><br />The week long hellish withdrawal that I described from xanax was about 2mg-3mg per day for me for roughly 1.5 months, thats it. A week of hell dude, from that. 40 mg???? Jesus christ.<br /><br />Withdrawal schedule info:<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=45539

				After taking 40 mg of xanax no reply is to be expected within the week. I just hope he somehow confused the dose and meant 40 mg diazepam, in which case everything will be pretty much back to normal after 2 good nights sleep - and a forgotten day in between them for most people.

				Yeah man, I would stop while you can. I just went from 8mg a day to 1mg over a 2 month period and it was hard. I reccomend Xanax XR it&#039;s not as much of a roller-coaster, but it&#039;s still more powerful then kpins.

				Hi Everyone,<br />&nbsp;I was admitted into hospital, yes i was using a very high dose of xanax and valium, I am currently writing this from hospital and they have steadiedme out with regular doses of around 30mg plus oxycontin for extremem head aches. I was hearing voices from the withdrawals and severe head throbbing headaches. All is looking better and its fucked going up and down from switching benzos.<br /><br />From now on I can&#039;t use benzos ever they dont mix with me and would like to war others of he extreme addiction potential. I have underlying anxiety issues and am now being treated for those as well, a team of counselors and specialists are helping me.<br /><br />After my father past away I went crazy and they are having a hard time trying to figure out my opoid tolerance as well.<br /><br />Thanks for everyone&#039;s help and concern things are looking better hopefully after the cat scan.<br /><br />All i can say is what a roller coaster and agony it is and has and will be.<br /><br />Thank u respect

				I guess I should of recommended to go straight to the ER at that kind of daily dose. Like I said, that is a life n death kinda game.&nbsp; They really have you on oxy for headaches? Thats questionable, but I hope it can be managed enough so that you arn&#039;t in too much agony. I would reallly think they should use valium as a taper tool at some point, in the same way Heroin addicts withdraw with the help of methadone, or suboxone for that matter. Whatever taper they do should be extremely slow and gradual.

				This thread really hits home with me. Benzos are so damn sneaky. Twice in the last year i&#039;ve gotten my hands on a fair amount, 100 mgs or so, and went on about month long usage of 2-3 mg&#039;s a day. I don&#039;t necessarily have anxiety too bad, but I do have occasional insomnia that seems to last for DAYS sometimes. If you&#039;ve ever had some serious insomnia, you know it can be pure hell. It takes on a life of its own. That&#039;s where xanax is an absolute lifesaver. <br /><br />But then you get to the end of your supply, and it&#039;s been a month or so, and the next week is total hell. The rebound insomnia is brutal, i&#039;m nervous and anxious all day long. No appetite. All hell breaks loose. I couldn&#039;t even imagine a 10 or even 40mg/day habit. Hell, If OP was doing 20 bars a day, I&#039;m willing to bet in a few weeks he won&#039;t even remember creating this thread!<br /><br />Be safe out there guys.

				does anyone else get significant memory problems after takin benzos? I bought xanax and have only used them a few times, for oral presentations and to help sleep the day of taking adderal. No more then 15-20 times every now and then and my memory is not the same it used to be which really pisses me off sometimes. Just forgetting little things I was just about to do and my general memory of remembering things. Ive always been an observant person, people are always surprised when I recall something in great detail that happened a long time ago, and now I have trouble remembering stuff every now and then. <br /><br />Just wondering, because I dont them often. Maybe its all in my head or my memory is just worse from drinking more. I do think my memory does get better if I dont take xanax, but curious if anybody knows if your memory can heal back to what it used to be

				Don&#039;t be overly concerned by that though, plenty of people require a nightcap of some alcohol with a benadryl to get a good nights sleep.<br /><br />As for the combination of benzo&#039;s with alcohol: anterograde amnesia ia -very- common. When taking a decent dose of benzo&#039;s with some drinks, expect memory to be lost from the moment you ingested that combination. Sometimes this is a desirable effect - who wants to remember sitting on an intercontinental flight for the better part of a day. In other situations you may find youself waking up somewhere with little to no idea how you got there.

				Benzos can cause short-term memory loss.&nbsp; It actually is a fairly common side effect.&nbsp; Long-term regular use or abuse can cause memory and cognitive impairment for months or even years after discontinuing the benzo.
