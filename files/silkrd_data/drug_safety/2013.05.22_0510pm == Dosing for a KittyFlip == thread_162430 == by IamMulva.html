				Hi<br />got some K and some MDMA. never done a Kitty Flip and thought I might give it a try. what kind of dosing mix should i have for the two? <br />IE<br /><br />__MDMA_mg__ and__K_mg__ together would make for a good roll.

				Sorry it is really hard to say, just take whatever does of mdma you are usually good with. And then dose small bumps of ketamine as you go.

				As far as the dosing goes.... I would recommend to simply roll as you were planning to, and dont do any kitty until the end of the roll when you are coming down 3 to 4 hours into it.<br /><br />Then I would just try a couple bumps to see how you like it.<br /><br />Then when you are ready for more of an intense experience go somewhere in the 50-100mg range for a nice first experience.<br /><br />Put on some nice relaxing music that you dig, and make a nice comfy place to lie down before doing do.&nbsp; Blow the line, lay back, and enjoy.<br /><br />K is a great complement to ecstacy - but only for the comedown in my opinion.&nbsp; Pretty much will overwhelm all of the other ecstacy effects that you normally like if you do it too early on.

I took a thumbprint (oral dose) last week on my come down and it helped stop that &quot;cracky&quot; after feeling a bit. about 40-50mg is my guess. it took about 20 mins due to the dose method but it was also real subtle and led to none of that sinking feeling ive had from snorting it.
