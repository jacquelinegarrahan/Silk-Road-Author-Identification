				Alprazolam powder dissolves easily in 190proof (95%) Alcohol/Ethanol but that stuff evaporates. I took my usual dose after having it for a week and had 2-3 martinis (normal for me) and cant remember half the night. Lucky I didnt do something dumb. be careful if using alcohol to dissolve and especially if the bottle has room in it cause every time you open, alcohol escapes, Alprazolam stays.... Stay Safe.<br /><br />Oliver(100) RULES BTW (Just a side note for a great seller)!<br /><br />-JosephSun&nbsp; &nbsp;

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In the case of alcohol and barbiturates, not only do they have an additive effect but they also increase the binding affinity of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding site, which results in a very significant potentiation of the CNS and respiratory depressant effects</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thats from wiki.<br /><br />What that means if you drink and take benzos at the the same time, you&#039;re multiplying the effects of both the alochol and benzos. You may of had 1-2mg of xanax, and 2 martinis ( the usual) but it probably feelt like 4-6 martinis by them selves. Because of the interaction with the alcohol and benzos. If you want a little story http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25011.msg346647#msg346647 <br />You can see the dangers of alochol and benzos mixed together. And people come up to me all the time and ask casually about benzos and alcohol, i have to scare the shit out of them cause they take it so lightly its not funny. Both are depressants (even though alochol dosn&#039;t seem like it) they both cause depression in your central nervous system much more so the benzos and alcohol multiplying the effects of the benzos by creating more binding affinity sites at the GABA receptors (in the spinal cord). And when those are full you go into a coma stop breathing heart stops beating etc. But since you&#039;re drunk or drinking at least you don&#039;t notice this depressive effect on your body you just think you are having a good time.<br />I wouldn&#039;t blame the evaporation of the liquid xanax. <br />Just try to be aware when you drink and take benzos that they mulitply on each other and be aware of your body and how it is reacting to both substances.

				To those worried - this doesn&#039;t actually happen.&nbsp; If you have everclear, it isn&#039;t going to evaporate at a significant enough rate to make much of a difference, even if the top is uncorked.&nbsp; At least not in the short term.&nbsp; If you cap the top when not in use, you will be completely fine and no change will occur.&nbsp; OP likely just made a mistake in combining with alcohol is misdosed himself or something.&nbsp;
