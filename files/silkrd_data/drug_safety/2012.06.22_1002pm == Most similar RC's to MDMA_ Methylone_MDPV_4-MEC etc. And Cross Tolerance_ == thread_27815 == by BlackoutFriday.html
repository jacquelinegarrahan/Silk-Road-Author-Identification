				What chemicals are most similar to MDMA? <br /><br />Do cross tolerances exist between the MDMA relatives to real MDMA?<br /><br />Can anyone help me from the below list of chemicals (or add more if possible)?<br />Methylone (bk-MDMA, M1), Butylone, Ethylone, 4-FA, 4-FMA, MDA, MDEA, 6-APB, 5-APB, 4-MEC, 4-MMC, Mephedrone<br /><br />I&#039;d like to update this topic as follows (This will be a great source for chemical information of the various types of MDMA analogs/close cousins/etc)<br /><br />Note, when describing dosing, it is designated by how much for a &quot;great&quot; start-up dose. Not a &quot;flooring&quot; dose, and not a &quot;threshold&quot; dose, but a dose that someone at a party would come back later and say &quot;That was some pretty good stuff!&quot;, hypothetically of course, if you were sharing :)<br /><br />Substance: MDMA (Methylene-Deoxy Methamphetamine)<br />Typical oral dose: 80-120 mgs<br />Oral onset: 30-90 till peak<br />Typical insufflated dose: 30-60 mgs<br />Insufflated Onset: 5-15 minutes<br />Effects/Extra Info: Produces a warm body &quot;loved up&quot; feeling. Famously referred to as &quot;the love drug&quot;. Induces great empathy. Euphoria can sometimes come in waves. Produces heightened emotions, usually of positivity. Sex is awesome (and often very emotional). Drug used to be used in marriage counseling with high success rates. Can produce an &quot;afterglow&quot; where the user feels good the next day, and possibly even the day or two afterwards. MDMA hangovers are usually not present the next day, but sometimes a few days later (hence &quot;Terrible Tuesdays&quot;). Hangovers are generally not felt with users who use moderately.<br />Oral versus Nasal administration: Oral is preferred, although onset is much longer. Oral leads to more &quot;loved up&quot; empathogenic feelings rather than a &quot;cracked out&quot; feeling that can sometimes accompany nasal administration<br /><br />(Will be updating with more later)<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot of positive reviews about 4-MEC being good with no hangover. Does anyone have experience with this?<br /><br />PLEASE only post drug information if you have experience with the ACTUAL drug. There are some people who say they take a gram of MDMA over the span of a few hours. While that&#039;s possible, with the real MDMA I&#039;ve encountered, that would certainly be very dangerous for almost any user. <br /><br />Also, please indicate how heavy your tolerance is with regards to drug dosage so as not to confuse users by thinking they need 500mgs of methylone to feel good, when really you might just be a drug abuser.

They are extremely comparable to each other, but the 4mmc tops it for me, its feels more intense and just has that bit of magic to it that 4mec dosent. <br />comparing 4MMC to mdma:<br /><br /><br />Substance: 4 - MMC (Mepehdrone)<br /><br />Typical oral dose: depending on ROA; for me, i&#039;ve only done this drug by snorting, which is usually around 100-150mg&#039;s for the first line, then 50-75mg&#039;s every half hour/1hour or so to keep it going. <br /><br />Oral onset: N/A<br /><br />Typical insufflated dose: 100-150 mgs and 50/75mg&#039;s to keep it going as described above.<br /><br />Insufflated Onset: 5-10 minutes to peak.<br /><br />Side/unwanted effects (this is what I have experience MYSELF, it may be different for YOU): very similar to MDMA for me, extremely dilated pupils, jaw clenching and grinding, short term memory loss (similar to alcohol), dry mouth/De-hydration and saying things that i have later regretted haha. High BPM/Tachycardia (this is pretty noticeable for me, my heart beats very quickly even when resting the day after a night of mephedrone use) <br />There&#039;s also the Vasoconstriction that you can experience with mephedorne, I&#039;ve never really *noticeably* had this, i think this only starts to happen after several days binging.<br /><br />Effects/Extra Info: Produces a warm body feeling, euphoria and happiness. music appreciation goes through the roof, almost uncontrollable urge to listen &amp; dance to music, slight empathy (urge to give your friends hugs &amp; talk about &#039;deep&#039; things), but just doesn&#039;t have the magic MDMA has. Slightly more stimulation that mdma IMO. Peak hits you within about 10minutes (snorted), lasts for about 20-30mins then slowly disappears back to baseline within about 60mins. To keep going i top up with a 50/75mg line every 30/60mins to keep the &#039;buzz&#039; going all night. 500mg would keep going till about 5/6 in morning easily. Can sometimes cause a an urge to redose, especially after a few lines. Tolerance or &#039;lost of magic&#039; after repeat use builds slightly, but not as bad as MDMA. Not really any come down, even after high doses. slight tiredness? But if mixed with even a small amount of alcohol, the comedown is a lot more noticeable. Very similar to hungover, even after only 1 beer.. Although a couple of beers really added to the &#039;buzz&#039; and was quite a nice mix. Another thing i notice is that when I start to come down, I can&#039;t stop pissing, i must go about 5 times within 2 hours on the comedown back to baseline. <br /><br />I&#039;ve mixed both MDMA and 4MMC together, and it was the most euphoric / loved up i&#039;ve ever felt, I started on the 4mmc as the mdma was peaking, kept me partying for 10+hours or so.. Comedown was pretty bad though. But nothing a few 5htp&#039;s didnt fix. <br /><br />I guess that if you were to take MDMA one night then 4MMC the next or vise versa, there would be a lot of noticeable cross tolerance, especially as both of them work on your serotonin receptors. I would recommend spreading the use out 3+ weeks... thats what i do anyway :)&nbsp; <br />

				Just a fair warning.&nbsp; Mephedrone smells disgusting and tastes disgusting.&nbsp; Subjectively, I would that it&#039;s less satisfying than MDMA.&nbsp; But of course, with all drugs your mileage may vary.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried any other MDMA-like substances.
