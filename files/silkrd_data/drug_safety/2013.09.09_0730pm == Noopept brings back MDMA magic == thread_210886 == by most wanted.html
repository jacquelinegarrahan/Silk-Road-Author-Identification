				While being relatively useless alone for me, it turned out that Noopept brings back the full-blown lovely &quot;magic&quot; of MDMA. It is also said to be neuroprotective.

				Well it&#039;s the same deal with pira, ani, oxi, prami and nefi. All seem to potentiate the effects of psychedelics, stimulants and empathogens in users.<br />Nefi and noopept also potentiated the effects of alcohol on me, but lessened hangover at the same time.

				I just accidentally threw away 15grams of noopept, don&#039;t remind me lol. Never tried it with MDMA though, only tried Piracetiam with MDMA and that defiantly helped for a smoother comedown.

				Nootropics as piracetam and noopept can be dangerous and neurotoxic in combination with stimulants and cause nasty unwanted side effects.<br />But I have also read it can help recovery after using stimulants or inbetween sessions.<br />most wanted: did you use noopept with mdma or on a separate occasion before the mdma?

				This is an interesting post. I had wondered about this. I will try to keep up with it and share my new experiences as well. Where can you guys find the best quality and what are your recommended dosing schedules? Also could you share a timeline of use and its noticeable effects along the way. I am extremely interested in this compound and think this thread will eventually benefit all who can make use of the info. Thanks &#039;most wanted&#039;.

				My internet study suggested that Noopept or Ноопепт will improve your memory as well as increase your cognitive perception, Now first thing I thought of is how will it effect long term marijuana users, Does the drug have to be taken on a daily bases to show any results or improvements ? <br /><br /><br />Could anyone share their experience with this please? Are they available in Russia without prescription?<br /><br />

It worked pretty well in the beginning. I experienced enhanced longterm memory, eye sight and concentration. My speech motorics also improved in a way that I could recall words in a better flow when speaking.<br />However as many people have stated on the longecity forums, noonpepts effects diminish slowly in some users (including me).<br /><br />Noopept is widely available in Europe and USA without prescription. It is also sold in Russian pharmacies along with piracetam for fatigue and alcohol withdrawal.<br />I highly suggest you red some posts on longecity.com - the community there is well known for their knowledge concerning nootropic chemicals.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210886.msg1531389#msg1531389">Quote from: fuckingACE on September 11, 2013, 10:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can someone who has tried it state its effects?

Noopept&#039;s toxicity is very minimal. Risk of OD is very low. <br />Improved vision, long term memory, concentration, speech motorics, mood uplifting, more wakeful at day time - Just to name a few. However these effects did not last for long for me. After 2 weeks of daily use I could already see the effects slowly diminish although noopept is supposed to be very subtle in the first place. I didn&#039;t take any choline supplements at the time, although some people will suggest taking some to minimize possible headache (I did not experience any).

Piracetam is much more sustainable long term. I highly recommend reading about nootropic substances more on |clearnet| longecity.com |clearnet|.&nbsp;
