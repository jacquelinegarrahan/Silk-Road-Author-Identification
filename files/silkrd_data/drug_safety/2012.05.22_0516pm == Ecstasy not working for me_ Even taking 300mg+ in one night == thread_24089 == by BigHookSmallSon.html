				Alright so I&#039;ve asked everyone else, I might as well ask the authorities on drug related matters.<br /><br />I have been buying ecstasy from SR for a while now but never taking them myself. Bought them all from SKYY and everyone who has tried them has said they are the best ever, so please don&#039;t say &quot;your pills are bunk&quot;. (Props to SKYY for quality product, all my friends love you) Eventually I had time to try some myself, which would be my first time taking ecstasy ever.<br /><br />Saturday night I was with friends and we were going to each take a pill and just relax and play some video games/listen to music. Friend takes his and he starts rolling hard in the first hour. I take mine and feel nothing and I end up taking another one about 2 and a half hours later. To end the night I still felt no effect.<br /><br />Last night I was set on getting some type of effect so I took 2 right away and a 3rd two hours later. Besides not being able to sleep after 9 hours there was no effect either.<br /><br />I am not on any medication(SSRI or what have you).<br /><br />Basically I plan on just taking 3 right away this weekend and hoping that works. Besides snorting and plugging, which I will try if taking 3 shows no effect, what should I do? Anyone have advice or anecdotes relating to this?

				Hmmmm..<br /><br />You 100% positive your not on any SSRI meds?? Any kind of meds at all???<br /><br />When i eat MDMA on a full stomach, in can take a full 2hrs for it to fully hit me. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like to redose more than an hour after eating my first dose.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not surprised you didn&#039;t roll yesterday, give yourself at least two weeks in between rolls, even if you didn&#039;t feel it the first time. <br /><br />I&#039;d say wait awhile, maybe get some crystal MDMA, weigh out 150mg, snort half eat half. <br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work, you need to find some new drugs to get into

				Try taking a break for a while... a few months at least, if you can. MDMA tolerance builds up incredibly fast and using it every weekend or even every other weekend is not a good move. <br /><br />If waiting for a couple of months doesn&#039;t work, you can always try starting a nootropic regime - the racetams in particular have been reported to &quot;bring back the magic&quot; of MDMA for those who haven&#039;t been able to achieve desired affects. Some people swear by them, and some people say they don&#039;t do much. However, for your situation, I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth a shot?<br /><br />Piracetam/Aniracetam/Pramiracetam are the ones you&#039;d want to research. I know there is a SR vendor - Tryptamine (forgive me if I misspelled his name) who is extremely knowledgeable about these nootropics and their effects. I believe he even has some stacks for sale. Look into it! Otherwise, if you can google/figure out correct dosages to work for you, you can order most of the racetams in bulk legally from amazon. <br /><br />I hope this helps!

				Yep! No medication at all, no drugs either.<br /><br />I only redosed because I wasn&#039;t feeling anything so I thought why not.<br /><br /><br />Would you say 3 days isn&#039;t enough time to feel anything? I&#039;m sure the effect wouldn&#039;t be the same with a 2 week break but it should still be there, right?<br /><br /><br />As for taking a few months break as suggested by Nocturnalbeyond718; I would if I had been taking ecstasy regularly. This was literally my second time ever and I don&#039;t think the tolerance builds up THAT fast.

I know some pretty big people and they normally eat the same amount i do with not much difference in effect, 125mg-200mg<br /><br /><br />And Big Hook, try taking at least a 2 week break. Yeah you didn&#039;t use MDMA much before, but you gotta let your brain restore some lost serotonin and shit.<br />Like Nocturnal mentioned look into supplements as well. Google preloading/postloading for MDMA and take some supplements so you know your brain is full of serotonin before you roll. <br /><br /><br />Eat 175mg of Skyy&#039;s MDMA and you should be good to go. If not I dont know what to tell ya

				Sometimes it&#039;s all about your frame of mind and your psychology at the time, some people say this is bullshit but it certainly isn&#039;t. MDMA is a drug which is extremely subjective to mood/surroundings as well as what meds you are on and body weight. I know from personal experience that there has been a few times where I have been in a shit mood or with people I didn&#039;t like and I couldn&#039;t come up. <br /><br />Just something to think over.

				I have noticed that a few people seem to be unresponsive to mdma especially the first few times they take it.<br /><br />I would say just stick to your guys and make sure not to eat for a few hours before hand. <br /><br />Start by popping one and wait about 30-45 minutes. If you still feel nothing pop a second one and wait as I wouldn&#039;t really recommend taking more than this as you can easily get sick. <br /><br />Good luck and happy rolling!

				I would be careful about taking large amounts or preloading heavily to get an effect. Just because you don&#039;t feel anything doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t having an impact on your brain, possibly a negative one.

				I guess, it&#039;s a fucking serotonine imbalance thing.<br />I don&#039;t feel anything with MDMA, E, LSD as well.<br /><br />I wait 4 weeks and do a bigger dose then. One week left.<br /><br />See this article for clarification:<br />http://guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/sep/28/depression-serotonin-neurogenesis?cat=science&amp;type=article<br /><br />That&#039;s why ADs do not work for about 50% of people doing them. There are too many serotonine receptors.<br />Fucking annoying.

				A serotonin issue would not explain insensitivity to LSD though, since its actions are mediated by a wide range of receptors, including the dopamine system.&nbsp; The serotonin pathway has a significant effect with LSD as well, but even if that were not vulnerable for some reason the effects on the other systems would certainly be noticeable at typical doses. You experience may be atypical, but not absent.

				I&#039;ve only taken MDMA 3 times. The last time I tried it, didn&#039;t feel much at all. That was 200mgs. I weigh 310lbs and I come in at 6 foot 4 inches. Then I remembered that two nights before I took a little suboxone. A tiny little pierce. Let me say that Suboxone really kills all chances of getting &quot;high&quot; at all. I did some tests. Even after 4 days of not taking Sub, a good &quot;high&quot; still couldn&#039;t be achieved. Not sure why I&#039;m saying this, but that sub is something.<br /><br />

				Do you take any supplements or vitamins?<br /><br />It&#039;s true what people say about MDMA being a finicky drug but I&#039;d expect you to get some effect if you aren&#039;t on meds and you&#039;re taking it on an empty stomach.&nbsp; You can definitely &quot;think yourself&quot; out of a roll, though.<br /><br />Just take your dose and then try to relax and forget that you took anything at all.&nbsp; Also, you might want to make sure that you&#039;re warm enough.&nbsp; Cold hands or feet can really effect your roll.&nbsp; Generally I dress warmly then when I start rolling I start shedding clothes and sweating everywhere.
