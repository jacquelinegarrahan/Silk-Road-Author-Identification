				Hello.. Is there difference tripwise between Psylocybe Cubensis and Panaeolus Cyanescens species?<br /><br />According to this: http://www.shroomery.org/6257/Magic-Mushroom-Dosage-Calculator<br /><br />those shrooms relation between psylocin and psylocibin are quite different. I hate cube trips, but was thinking - mayperhaps panaeolus trip is somehow different, and I might enjoy it?

				pan cyans are a diff species which are alot harder to grow and are 5x as potent, so if you take 5g&#039;s dry cubes then you take 1g dry cyans. Cyans also contain another chemical that cubes dont which give them a really magical quality. Keep in mind when you dry either of them alot of that goodness gets oxidized and destroyed, so if you want a real shroom experience you have to grow them yourself.

				raelag, There will be a difference but in order to say I would need to know why you hate Cubensis trips. What is it about the trip that you do not like?<br /><br />90% of any mushroom trip is going to be set and setting.

				shroom trips are easily going bad.<br /><br />Slight unsettling thought in the head, and trip is ruined.<br /><br />Syntetics like 2C-B and LSD is rather more pleasant, and I should say comfortable.. Not that I like those neither, reminds of mushrooms, but! Only somewhat.<br /><br />Shroom trips are so easily to go bad.. I guess you are right, set and setting is what I should pay attention to more carefully.

				as about growing them.. I do. I consider myself rather skilled with shroom species, took few courses in uni too (not a basis, but enchance knowledge of mushroom families)<br /><br />In my opinion - shrooms are easiest to make, even more complicated species like pans.. Whats the difference : sterile enviroment, and only what makes cubes different is that pans need horse poo :-) Well, not need, but standart PF tek gives on pans such small fruits that those are impossible to print and even harvest.. Microscopic, tiny, lilliput shrooms :-) Meanies should be.. But never tried, due to rather hatred of cubes.<br /><br />If only I would like&#039;em, I&#039;d be settled with drugs for life. But.. Cannabionoids and cathiones are my love, shrooms are more on the hate side of scale :-)<br />

I&#039;ve had a few trips where I&#039;ve had my arse kicked but they were really insightful as well and made me face things in my life that I was avoiding. Even though I was being kicked hard I was able to laugh about it, at least a little. <br />If I hated it though I just don&#039;t think that I&#039;d go back whether I could grow them or not. There are plenty of other ways to get insight. <br />Best of luck.

				Thought so.<br /><br />Thanks.. Shroom trips aren&#039;t totally useless, feel myself much wiser each time I tried them. But - rather harsh and hard experience, and seems Pans are even more so, none less.<br /><br />Well, thanks for headsup :-)

				Sterile enviroment as in uni bio lab.. Don&#039;t think they need it tho, just today was experimenting at home with pans. <br /><br />Will work - will work. Will not, well.. Will tweak process.<br /><br />Bio lab is good think for other purposes as well - they got excellent hashmaking screens :-)<br /><br />Edit: Hm, that&#039;s a good idea, btw. Thanks

I did my first agar work isolating Ps. Mexicana in the kitchen under such conditions. Hell, I set my Laminar flow hood up on the kitchen table for years.<br /><br />Never underestimate what can be accomplished in a kitchen.

				So far, so good - with right substrate pans are healthy and seem to colonize quite happily:<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=02a3eefa5931317fe7bd183e3b6246e8.jpg (img, copy/paste, tor)<br /><br />Sure, there is infection vector on birth and casing, but I do really believe, that coprophilic mushroom would like best substrate, which also makes it prone to infection.<br /><br />[advertisement break]<br /><br />Soon project &#039;Panaeolus Cambodginesis&#039; is ready, but I don&#039;t like them, so they go all on SR. Any takers :-) ?<br /><br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34189.msg389964#msg389964 (Same forum, offers section, interest test)<br /><br />And, like already stated, cubes are EASY. And I am sure I will get those, for pans there is possibility of error, never did this before.<br /><br />What I try to say, is that I probably will soon SR pans, and definitely SR cubes, just feel a bit insecure about vendor account, it is a bit pricey.<br /><br />Was thinking postage to whole EU.

Pans aren&#039;t that hard to grow. They will only grow mushrooms when in compost and/or straw. That is really the only difference between growing Cubes and Pans. I used to grow them years ago. It isn&#039;t easy to grow lots of them and they have a smaller yield than Cubes. And yes, to answer the OP&#039;s question. They are more potent and do have a slightly different feeling. I prefer them, but as someone stated above, you really have to grow them yourself to experience it. Or you can go to Jamaica. I saw a shitload of Pans in Jamaica.

				Dark art of old forumthread necromancy :-)<br /><br />Anyway, as about pans, I was able to grow some:<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=9114f0e0bc193821b6bf841ab875eb26.jpg<br /><br />However one flush provided about 3.5g of fresh mushroom bodies.<br /><br />So.. To share an experience - substrate is vital, without &quot;secret ingredient&quot; substrate colonization is very prone to infection. This is how my previous project ended.<br /><br />With &quot;secret ingredient&quot; pans grow, as it was mentioned before - somewhat cube likely.. There seems to be way for further improvement though.<br /><br />This time I was very cautious with casing, and it seems like mistake - pans mycelium colonized it whole, and then formed shiny hard shell.<br /><br />This &quot;shelling&quot; seemingly lessens flush dramatically, so here is the wisdom - casing is almost obligatory, and I&#039;d propose casing without energy in it, only just to keep water (vermiculite, sand, soil, etc)<br /><br />This is so far just theory, but anyway - I got 3.5 pans, so project is academic success. :-P to all naysayers<br /><br />PS I am fully aware that I keep &quot;secret ingredient&quot; secret. However - this should do for occasional reader. And if you are REALLY into growing pans - you should already know what I am talking about. Sure - I will help... raelag@tormail.org, pgp encrypted pls. Just for blackmarket discipline :-)<br /><br />
