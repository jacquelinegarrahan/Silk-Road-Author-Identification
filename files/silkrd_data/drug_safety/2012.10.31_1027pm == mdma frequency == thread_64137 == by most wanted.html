				We all love the magic of mdma.&nbsp; :)<br />We all would like to have the great feeling and the magic it gives us as often as possible.<br />Whats the highest frequency we can use it without loss of magic.<br />I know that there is no 100% reliable and correct answer to this question. It&#039;s probably different for everyone.<br />But I would like to hear your opinion and experiences. How often do you use it.<br />What do you think is the highest frequency the average person can take mdma without loss of magic or negative side effects.<br />Thank you.<br />

				When I first started using MDMA, I couldn&#039;t believe there was a chemical that could make me feel so good. It was very hard to explain the magic of it to all my friends who hadn&#039;t tried it.<br />I always wanted to be taking either pills or powder to feel the magic, but it wore off very soon, as taking it became so routine.<br /><br />At that point, I realised that saving MDMA for big occasions was a far better option. That was a few years ago now, and coincidentally, it was very hard to get good pills/MDMA where I come from. Then, all of a sudden, the Summer of 2010 came around with these batches of super pills that were really good quality, so I ended up taking it a lot that Summer. Generally, during Summer months, I take it a bit more than I would during the other seasons. This is because I go to a lot of festivals.<br /><br />When I am not going to festivals, I tend to maybe use it once a month or maybe every two months. Silk Road has made this a difficult commitment to&nbsp; keep however, as there is so much top quality MDMA and pills to choose from. I took some Ferrari pills over the weekend just gone and it was my third weekend in a row doing MDMA, which is a lot for me. So, for now, I am making a solid commitment to lay of it for a couple of months so I can have the magic back in time for New Years :)

				Over the years I&#039;ve had many favourite drinks, from vodka to whisky to brandy, but eventually I go overboard and puke it back up and then my enthusiasm for it wanes. This happened to my friend with eating prawns every day (I warned him), and I&#039;ve seen dogs take a dislike to sausages after puking them up a couple of times. Well that&#039;s what happened to me with MDMA, got too high too many times and now I associate the taste of it and feeling in my stomach with being sick which has ruined it forever.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also had some seriously bad paranoid breakdowns due to amphetamines and would recommend taking a break of at least a couple of weeks between doses. My honeymoon lasted about 6 years with MDMA / XTC pills taken once a month maximum, which is quite a good innings.<br /><br />I now just use it on special occasions in small doses, a couple of times a year maximum. I can&#039;t get totally wasted or I&#039;m guaranteed to vomit and I can&#039;t re-dose or I&#039;m guaranteed to go paranoid.

				My DOC is MDMA, after i first tried it i became obssesed with it and started taking it WAAAAY to much and looking back i was strait up destroying myself, major depression, losing my mind, weak, ext. Over the past 3 years i have learned so much about the drug and what it does to your brain and i have seperated the truth from the rumors such as it leaves holes in your brain if you take it to much ( RUMOR) that is actually not true at all. If you want more info on why that rumor came around and what it actually does just ask and i would be more then happy to tell you everything i know about MDMA. As for frequency my personal prefrence on how often to take it is at least give your self 1 month between rolls, 1 month is still a little bit to often for my liking. The way i look at it which helps me alot is always tell yourself the longer i wait the bettter it will be, if youve waited a month just imagine how good the roll will be if you wait 2 and then 3&nbsp; ext. :) Stay safe with your rolling guys it can really fuck your shit up if you take it wrong, also i have learned that if you wait 2 days after you roll take some 5-htp and it will speed up gaining your seritonin back. PLEASE BE SAFE IF YOU TAKE 5HTP you can really fuck yourself over i cant be more seriouse, if you take it while rolling you can get seritonin poisining and you will really regret it trust me. i like to stay safe and take it 2 days after, also dont take it for a couple days before you roll also. If anyone has anymore questions i would love to answer them :)
