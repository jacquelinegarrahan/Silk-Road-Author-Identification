				I am about to do a little experiment. I want to try as many drugs on this site as possible. I will, of course, be asking questions and researching before I do them.

If I have a bad trip what is the best way to control it/calm down? Beta blockers and benzos?<br />Is there a specific kind of acid that would be good for me or is that a silly question?

It&#039;s really helped me before, it calms me down very quickly. LSD is just LSD. More importantly, set and setting tend to be major factors in deciding whether you have a good or bad trip.

				Dude if you think you are pre disposed to a mental health issue (which i dont think you are) don&#039;t bother dropping L. If you had such a rough time with something mildly hallucinogenic then L&#039;s gunna fuck you up. Get some coke or speed or something. Or salvia and you&#039;ll realise it wasnt that.

				you probably won&#039;t get much out of psychedelics if your goal is to &quot;do as many drugs as possible.&quot; they are powerful tools that must be treated with respect. tread lightly. if you&#039;re having a bad trip, DON&#039;T TRY TO CONTROL IT! that&#039;s the biggest mistake you can make. control over a trip is the last refuge of a dying ego. to remain calm during times of negativity, don&#039;t rely on benzos to make everything better. all it takes is no resistance, and complete acceptance of how you&#039;re feeling. i highly suggest reading the psychedelic experience, it&#039;s packed with information you could benefit from. anyone interested in psychedelics should read it.

				That&#039;s a really interesting reply.<br />As you imagine, after the experience I had, I (like the other poster) thought I was a freak. I thought I had gone mad. I never got to the bottom of it. it was an intensely powerful and disturbing experience. It&#039;s not like I had taken shit loads of acid (or any drug) it was just ignited by two puffs of whatever it was I had. I read Aldus Huxley&#039;s DOP and H&amp;H soon after. It did make a lot of sense. Self imposed purgatory. But what made it happen? I will never know. This is why I often think it sparked off psychosis or schizophrenia. <br /><br />I want to try all the drugs once. I want to experience all the feelings. I didn&#039;t mean as many as possible in the other other sense.<br />I want to know why people fall in love with H. Why Jim Morrison and Syd Barrett loved LSD. And why so many people love the rest.<br />I have done MDMA and Speed many times. Loved both. Those days are over no as I&#039;ve retired from clubbing. Smoked cannabis when drunk but quit after the &#039;incident&#039;.<br /><br />If I do try the LSD I think betablockers will help. I have a fear of dying of a heart attack due to a minor condition...and it runs in the family. If my heart stays calm that is taken out of the equation. I think.<br /><br />I hope the experts don&#039;t get annoyed by my naive questions.

				Acid is acid, it varies based on dosage. Most blotters on SR will contain somewhere around 125 micrograms, that would probably be the ideal dose for a beginner. Its hard to have a really bad LSD trip on that low of a dose IMO, unless you&#039;re extremely anxious/scared and can&#039;t stop worrying about it...<br /><br />Only take LSD when the time is right and you feel confident. Never use it if you&#039;re having doubts or are trying to lift urself out of a bad mood(it will do just the opposite).

				IMO, I dont think you should take a bunch of different drugs, especially hallucinogens, at one time... Spread them out at least. Be careful with whatever you choose do to, but be responsible with it.

				It&#039;s more of a &quot;I want to do a lot of drugs&quot; than an experiment. Experiments have a control, a purpose, a goal, hypotheses, various dependent and independent variables, various testing conditions for various parts of the experiment, etc. This doesn&#039;t really meet the definition of an experiment, it&#039;s more a user just wanting to try a lot of drugs, which is why a lot of us are here anyway.
