				Yeah no need to mix these two drugs especially if you haven&#039;t done them before.<br /><br />What you described is pretty typical come up for MDMA though. Most of the time the first time people take it they can get a little anxious and almost always if they do the thought that pops in their head is &quot;Did I take too much?&quot;<br /><br />In the future you will want to do MDMA alone and measure out your dose. I personally don&#039;t recommend snorting MDMA based on years of playing with the stuff it just seems to waste more of it than all the other ROAs&#039;s. Nothing wrong with snorting, lots of people do, just personal preference.<br /><br />Most people start with an oral dose of between 100-120mg and that seems to get them where they are going. You&#039;ll still have the come up thing next time but since you know what it feels like it won&#039;t be nearly as bad. For most people, if it gets a little rough, they will puke at that point and don&#039;t get all scared if you do. About a second after puking the world turns amazing.<br /><br />Depending on how much mephedrone you did, you may or may not be able to fully enjoy all the goodness of MDMA so you might want to wait a few days and give just MDMA a go on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				Snorting is definately a waste, the bioavailability is of MDMA is much higher when eaten. Its not exactly pleasant to snort either! I agree with DiamondSky&nbsp; about the 100-120mg dose. I think the threshold dose is around that mark. I have a lot of experience with MDMA and can tell that alot of people are sick whilst coming up, even experienced users. Those first few times with the drug are an amazing experience, wish I could go back! Enjoy

				I wouldn&#039;t reccomend mixing for first timers but what&#039;s done is done haha. As others have said the anxiety can really be an issue(only during the come up I&#039;ve found) for mdma. The first time I took it I thought I was actually going to die and spent 10-15 minutes googling what is a dangerous dose(even only on 100mg) rofl.

				You should always be considerate if you suffer from anxiety and take drugs.<br /><br />Personally i have not find that mdma makes it any worse, though cannabis does when taken at the wrong time. You should be careful with taking new drugs in general though, there are many that aren&#039;t a good idea if you are suffering from panic disorder or something similar.

				This is good info, because I&#039;m thinking of trying MDMA.&nbsp; I usually just do benzos, but I want to try &quot;up&quot; instead of &quot;down&quot;.&nbsp; I wonder if taking zofran or phenergan with the MDMA would relieve the retching urge.&nbsp; What are your thoughts?

				Don&#039;t ask for advice if you don&#039;t want to hear advice. Sounds like you almost lost your limbs buddy. Some people are more sensitive to certain drugs than others. My gf&#039;s ex had a large piece of his legs removed because the muscle was dying (perhaps could have happened to you since they were turning blue) in response to some MDMA. For whatever reason, he had that reaction. I believe he had even done it before but something happened that time and he was lucky to be alive.<br /><br />Take drugs seriously even if you&#039;re getting silly. Take advice of veterans seriously.
