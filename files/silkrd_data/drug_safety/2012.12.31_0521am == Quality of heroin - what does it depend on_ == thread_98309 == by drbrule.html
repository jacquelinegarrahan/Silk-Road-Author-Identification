				So we all know there&#039;s good dope, and then there&#039;s not so good dope. But what I&#039;m wondering is, is this only dependent on the cut, or something else? Theoretically, doing .1 of something 100% pure should feel just the same as doing an entire gram of something only 10% pure, right? It&#039;s all the same chemical in the end, no? Or does it depend on other factors as well, such as the production process, yielding an initial product that&#039;s not entirely pure from the start? I have no idea how that process works, going from a poppy to the end result, so...<br /><br />This is disregarding the different types such as BTH or #4, for the sake of argument pretend we&#039;re only dealing with one type. But I only have the vaguest understanding of that as well, is there a ranking of these types from best to worst? My understanding is that most would prefer #4 over BTH, but is this only personal preference since you could potentially have some pure tar?<br /><br />I apologize if this has been asked a million times before, I wish there was a Heroin For Dummies&nbsp; :-\

				The difference between the 100% pure and 10% pure is you&#039;re sticking 90% shit in your body and that could be anything from baby powder to cement dust. It&#039;s always better to have the &#039;pure&#039; simply because it&#039;s better for you even though theoretically it would be that same as long as the other shit didn&#039;t badly react in your body. As for the whole #4/BTH thing it&#039;s all down to personal preference. Most people I know would take BTH over #4 all day long because of the stonier more narcotic effect but I personally would take #4 over all else simply for convenience.<br /><br />The numbers system is basically just steps in the manufacturing process. If I recall correctly, #1 is plain old opium, #2 is morphine base, #3 is brown heroin which needs a little acidity to be ready for injection and #4 is the hydrochloride salt which only needs water to be ready for a shot. This is all repeated knowledge apart from the fact I know for a fact #4 is the salt and #3 is the brown which needs the acid.<br /><br />Hope this helps, I&#039;ve been looking for my own heroin advice tonight but nobody took the bait : (

				Thanks man, that does indeed explain a lot, you covered just about everything!<br /><br />I&#039;d help you out but unfortunately I only have experience with tar, and smoking rather than shooting.&nbsp; :-\

				This is a question that plagued me for years, take H No.3 (most common H in UK). Now say you get a bag of really good H, lets say 80% pure. You smoke it or dig it and get gouched out to heaven. But.....lets say the purity has now been cut to 10% purity, theoretically, 8 of those bags smoked should get you to the same state, injected, they should. BUT... they never do, I have heard of it being connected to the speed of absorption- smoking 8 bags is going to take 8 times as long, therefore, you are not assimilating it as fast, but even if you inject the lot in one go, it still won&#039;t get you to the same high- thinking on my feet, I suppose after injecting 8 in one go, your liver has all that extra gunk (cut) to deal with as well as the H- maybe that&#039;s the reason, but it never seems to work that way- have we any scientists/pharmacologists on the forum who can give a definitive answer- not just heresay! I would be fascinated to know- it&#039;s the same with many other drugs too!
