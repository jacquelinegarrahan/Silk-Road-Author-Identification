				Oxycontin is stronger that codeine which is basically part of the opium poppy - a natural alkaloid. <br /><br />Oxycontin is a synthetic opioid. Having tried both, I would say the 5mg of Oxy equalled maybe 120mg of codeine. <br /><br />If you are NOT used to opiates or opioids then 5mg of Oxy would be very strong - but so would 120mg of pure codeine.<br /><br />Codiene is way cheaper than Oxy. for the price of one Oxy I think I got 28 30mg codeine tabs which beats 5mg of Oxycontin.<br /><br />The synthetic opioids are VERY expensive drugs. <br /><br />I thought the Oxycontin was mild really. I felt it but it was short lived and not as &#039;natural&#039; as codeine.<br /><br />Its easy to get used to oxy and people here who use these regular would laugh at 5mg really. But for a beginner it will work.<br /><br />As ever there are fans for both drugs.<br /><br />Codeine is WAY cheaper and less dangerous to overdose on. <br /><br />Oxycontin could see you spending BIG bucks for just 40mg. Check the prices out. I cannot see why Oxycontin is so highly priced. Heroin is cheaper I think! But fuck that for a habit. I got enough habits and that one I don&#039;t need.<br /><br />Your choice.

				I&#039;d say 5mg of oxycodone feels like ~90mg of codeine to me, but then again my tolerance is rather low (36mg tramadols give me an opiate buzz). I take 5/325 percs whenever my repetitive stress injuries and what not distract me from my work and they do the job quite well every time. <br /><br />To make sure I get the most from what I consider to be a very low dose, I follow some of &quot;NoWarning’s New &amp; Improved Opi­ate Poten­ti­a­tion Guide&quot;; found here: humanasemeritus dot com/dose-zine/issue-one/<br /><br />Here&#039;s the formula he gives:<br /><br />* T-60) 600mg Taga­met HB(Cimetidine HCl), 1000mg DLPA OR 500mg N-Acetyl-Tyrosine and a large glass of (white) Grape­fruit juice, prefer­ably from con­cen­trate. Add in an extra strength tums or 1.5tbsp. of bak­ing soda if you are going to be eat­ing your opi­ates.<br />* T-45) 30mg DXM HBr, 90mg phenyl­to­lax­am­ine cit­rate, 600mg Mag­ne­sium citrate\taurate\glycinate\chelate<br />* T-20 A bot­tle of tonic water (qui­nine), 880mg Naproxen Sodium. A cup of cof­fee, or a strong black tea. Take another tums now if you’re eat­ing your opi­ate to coun­ter­act the tonic water<br />* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opi­ate<br />* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more, you don’t want to over power it.<br /><br />^DO NOT USE THIS FORMULA IF TAKING CODEINE, EXCEPT FOR THE DXM AND PERHAPS AN ANTIHISTAMINE.<br /><br />I personally cut out the tagament, amino acids, magnesium, and the entire bottle of tonic water (ewww!). I&#039;ll drink a cup or two of white grapefruit juice from concentrate, then wait a little, take the 30mg of DXM (do not do this daily), one 25mg benadryl (in place of the phenyl-lol-axamine), wait some more, then drink a tall glass and a half of tonic water with quinine, chew up one tums, and then take maybe a naproxen or two once in a while (don&#039;t take that too often, especially if you have a bad stomach).&nbsp; For me, this makes a 5mg oxy feel relative to ~10mg as well as potentiating the effects past 8 hours sometimes, depending on what I ate and stuff. Oh, and I also smoke bud throughout the day so that last part doesn&#039;t really apply lol<br /><br />OK so I just did some searching. Oxycodone is around 6-8x more powerful than codeine, so 5mg of oxy is like 30-40mg of codeine according to early google search sources. I find that a single 5mg oxy is definitely stronger in every way than one tylenol 3 (30mg of codeine) or even two of them for that matter.

				Thanks for the information. I think I&#039;ll just stick to what I know. The codeine I&#039;m seeing is available from overseas, and I&#039;m not a very patient person when it comes to receiving stuff in the mail!!

				Some codeine here is very expensive, I got 28 pure codeine tabs (tiny) in the prescription pack for a real bargain price. A few vendors get this in from time to time.<br /><br />You can easily extract the codeine from the over the counter pills you can get in the UK and many other nations.<br /><br />We have a mix of 8mg codeine and 500mg&nbsp; apap or paracetamol. Some contain caffeine but best not use those.<br /><br />In the UK it costs about 1 BTC for 64 codeine and paracetamol tablets. This is 512 mg of codeine. A gram of codeine for about 2 BTC. <br /><br />Some really expensive brand name pills in the UK get away with 12.8mg of dyhydrocodine which is about a third stronger than codeine. <br /><br />To extract the codeine there are tens of thousands of instructions out there. The best way for most is plain old cold water and some filters. Codeine is highly soluble in cold water whilst paracetamol is not. Also if you follow the instructions 100% you will not be able to actually dissolve enough paracetamol to cause any harm. Small amounts of paracetamol will be there but if you dry out the filtered paracetamol you will know to the mg how much you really did filter. <br /><br />You could simply leave the filtered codeine in water evaporate and collect the powder.<br /><br />Actually, many people on prescription filter the paracetamol out. Very effective pain management. Also - if you take up to 4 grams of paracetamol per day (usual amount people get prescribed for max dose) then its 21 grams a week. There are changing attitudes to paracetamol and some experts say that we are prescribing too much paracetamol. People using 1092 grams of paracetamol for years and years must be making the body do a lot of work getting rid of something which can be lethal at 10 grams or even 5 grams IF there are medical risk factors. Be VERY careful if washing any tablets. You would have at least 16 grams of paracetamol which is enough to kill you! Be careful. Weigh the paracetamol after a wash and you will always be safe. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure there is a thread somewhere here on extracting codeine. No need to rewrite it. Just pick something off a reputable drug forum that is verified as being a good source of information if there is nothing here.<br /><br />Most people in the UK extract what they need,&nbsp; pack of 32 tablets will give us 256mg of codeine. Say 10% loss makes it 220mg or so. You can mix the water/codeine mix then pour as required. Four glasses would be 55mg codeine. That would really be felt by anyone who has not used but if you have never used a drug always take a small sample in case you are allergic or have a reaction.<br /><br />Codeine tastes foul. We add some cordial to taste. Even then you may need to eat something sweet or suck on a mint. But taste aside, its the cheapest drug by far when you consider purity and I guess 220mg of codeine for 0.5 BTC would see those 30mg tablets go for less than 0.1 BTC. So 10 BTC would buy you 110 tabs or over 3 grams of codeine.<br /><br />Codeine is very addictive if used for recreational purposes. for pain management you can use the max of 240mg per day UK limits. That is &#039;enough&#039; for many painful ailments and conditions. <br /><br />Most codeine addicts in the UK are ordinary people who discovered buying a brand name over the counter pain killer made them feel cheerful as well as stopping pain. A mix of ibuprofen and dihydrocodeine means many people take a LOT of these tablets. Overdose is 400mg per kilogram in children - adults its more but no definitive number. you can take a lot of ibuprofen but long term its got to be bad. People can take up 32 pills in a day, some took more than that. they lived. Others kicked the bucket or ended up needing 24 hr care.<br /><br />IF anyone here is just a regular Joe or Jill who got an addiction to codeine or dihydrocodeine, then washing tablets is the best way to wean yourself off. <br /><br />Or if people need pain management and are desperate then a codeine wash is the simplest bit of chemistry you could ever really find. <br /><br />It VERY addictive if used for recreation. Be warned. It is easy to build up a tolerance to it and you can be high as a eagle on 30mg but dosing on 300mg soon afterwards. People have taken amounts as high as 3 grams per day. So be careful.<br /><br /><br />
