				Has this been discussed here already? Since I like to indulge in both drugs from time to time I&#039;m curious as to the pharmacological differences. Do both work on the same receptors and produce similar effects, just in different intensity? Meth of course gets a much worse rap, mainly to it being associated with the trailer park, much like heroin. In WW2 ordinary soldiers took meth however, as far as I know both in the German and Japanese armies, and most of those people returned home relatively normal people, asides from the war scars. The same for all those heroin addicted Vietnam vets btw, John Rambo was the exception / isn&#039;t a real person.<br /><br />What I mainly noticed is that <br /><br />- Meth works in lower doses, like a gram of meth will last you&nbsp; for days if you don&#039;t absolutely overdo it, while a gram of amphetamine can be consumed in one evening, if you have some tolerance<br />- The effects of meth are much longer lasting, in higher doses you still feel it 24 hours later<br />- Of course meth can be vaporized and inhaled which doesn&#039;t work for amphetamine, but that&#039;s not a pharmacological difference, but has chemical reasons (like I think amphetamine in the form normally sold has a higher melting point and so will burn before it vaporizes or something like that, never was good at chemistry)<br /><br />But does meth actually work on different receptors than amphetamine, or is it just a stronger, longer acting version of amphetamine, the way Fentanyl is basically a more potent form of morphine, of which you take maybe 100 mikrograms as a normal dose, vs. 10 mg for morphine.<br /><br />I guess everybody here will agree that meth is stronger at the same dosage, but does anybody know by how much (like 10 mg of meth = 30 mg of amphetamine sulfate or does some formula of this kind exist?), the way you can compare different opioids according to potency? Like let&#039;s say Fentanyl I think is 100 times more potent than morphine, any data on meth?<br /><br />Also meth vs. ephedrine would be interesting too, clearly ephedrine is a euphoric stimulant and can be used to make meth, the effects in the same dosage are of course much weaker, but are the effects the same, apart from being weaker?
