				Hey toysoldier :)<br /><br />It will depend on what kind of heroin it is, but if its brown as I assume it is, you just take the spoon or whatever, drop like maybe half of 0.1 (since this is your first time, and injecting heroin is EXTREMELY dagnerous, had a friend who died from it yesterday and I myself have had many overdoses because of IV&#039;ing H). Ok! so you got the spoon with the heroin in it, then you take like 1/4 ascobiric acid or citric acid of how much heroin you got in the spoon, then you take like 1ml of water and throw it in the mix, now its time to cook up! carefully hold a lighter under the spoon till you se the heroin starts dissolving in the water, now you can filter it with a little ball of cotton and get it back in to the pump, now you are ready to inject - Now please remember to be careful, as i said earlier, heroin is not something you toy with!

Peoples lives start to unravel generally after using H IV with such rapid progression it is honestly stunning. Be safe please. <br /><br />- miR

				Dude soldier, don&#039;t do it. I know that shitty of me to try to tell a stranger what to do, but seriously I&#039;ve watched my brother go through and continue an H addiction for the past decade. Its been REALLY hard on him (dudes in prison now&nbsp; :(), its been hard hard on me, hard my parents, etc...His life is fucking shit now. <br />He says ALL the time he wishes he could turn back time and not shoot dope. He said he could have turned back before that, but after that, no way. idk how true that is might be crutch but you hear it a lot. I&#039;ve also watched him go through literally, unspeakable things physically and mentally...ugh....makes my stomach churn. He&#039;s stolen from me countless times, he left me his dog, (which he accused me of stealing even though his junkie ass skipped the state without saying a peep to anyone for months with his puppy at my apartment) only to buy another puppy which died when nodded out and suffocated the poor thing&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Once again solidger do as you please, but if i were you, i&#039;d oot that shit just cuz you can&#039;t very well trash it&nbsp; ;)(right you can do that? lol i dont use H obviously) then back down to oc then down suboxone o something you probably know better than I. Then you you can live the rest of your life happiness, instead of the next two years in happiness and then the rest of your life in hell...its practically suicide bro. NOT KIDDING two of my boys from HS died just this past year from shooting H...it seems all the pill heads from HS graduated to heroin and now they&#039;re dropping like flies&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Plus who wants to be dope sick for the rest of their life, anyhow&nbsp; <br /><br />sorry for preaching, but if I could seriously prevent just one person from shooting that stuff...

				I&#039;d advise you not to bang heroin the first time by yourself, maybe snort a small bit and wait 20 minutes.<br />But if you are absolutely determined to inject heroin a great opiate site on clearnet with excellent infomation on harm reduction is opilophile.com.<br /><br />What type/sizes of syringes do you have first of all?

				IV can be quite safe if you take the time to learn what you are doing, and if you don&#039;t deviate from accepted, safe practices.<br /><br />Start off small...&nbsp; You can&#039;t take it back out once you&#039;ve pushed that plunger, but you can always inject again if you need more.&nbsp; Take the amount you can snort (and still function), then cut it in half.<br /><br />Make sure you aren&#039;t alone- opiate overdoses are typically not fatal as long as someone is around to perform CPR and call for help if the user stops breathing.<br /><br />Use a fresh spike every time.&nbsp; 29 gauge, 1/2 inch needles are good to start out with.&nbsp; The really fine needles (31 gauge) require a little more finesse.<br /><br />Always inject towards your heart (the needle should be pointed toward your body)<br /><br />Use alcohol swabs, or cotton balls soaked with alcohol on the injection site.<br /><br />Make sure you are hydrated and warm.&nbsp; This is to ensure that your veins are easily visible and pronounced.<br /><br />Tie off if you need to, but release the tourniquet before pushing the plunger.<br /><br />Find a suitable vein on the back of your hand or arm.&nbsp; Hold the needle at a slight angle, and parallel to the vein, with the sharp tip against your skin (hole in tip pointing up).<br /><br />Push quickly and carefully.&nbsp; With practice, you&#039;ll be able to feel the needle penetrate the vein.&nbsp; Pull back on the plunger to register and make sure you are in the vein.&nbsp; Push the plunger slowly.&nbsp; If it burns, or you see a bubble forming at the injection site, then stop.&nbsp; The needle has come out, or pushed through to the other side.&nbsp; Pick another spot and try again.<br /><br />Veins on the backs of your hands are easier to see, but tend to &quot;roll&quot; out of the way.&nbsp; Veins in the crooks of your elbows tend to roll less, but are a little harder to see and hit (at least on my anatomy, your mileage may vary).<br /><br />Know this before you take the plunge:&nbsp; Once you become accustomed to the rush of shooting drugs intravenously, it will more than likely become your preferred route of administration.&nbsp; There was once a time when the thought of shooting up made me light headed and woozy because I hated needles so much.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even imagine doing it.&nbsp; Now, I can&#039;t imagine doing it any other way...&nbsp; Even though I no longer have a habit, IV still tops my list of pleasures of which I could never deny myself indefinitely, whether it be heroin, coke, meth, or even some pills (use of a micron filter is very important if you are banging pills).<br /><br />Just be careful and know what you are getting into before you start down this road.<br />

				Not related to you above question but may i add It is best to go into the vein, never go through an artery there&#039;s too much pressure going through them( it will bubble like a motherfucker). If you&#039;re not sure how to differentiate the two. If you feel a pulse, that&#039;s an artery &amp; a no go. A novice tip but I thought it may be of use.

				&quot;A few grains of sand&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Tony&#039;s dope sure is fire.
