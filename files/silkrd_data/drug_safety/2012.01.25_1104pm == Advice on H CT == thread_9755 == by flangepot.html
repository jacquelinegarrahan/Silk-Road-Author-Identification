				Hi All,<br /><br />Ive been dabbling in H - had about 3grams of strong gear over the last 3 months say. doing 1g in about a week, snorting or smoking. The last time i finished my gear just in the New Year, i did feel like shit (there a surprise), slept the first day, on and off, how and cold, sweating, and the day aftre just felt like shit, and when i got back to work was miserable and anxious, clucking... <br /><br />Had about 3 weeks of taking nothign, then picked up a g recently - lovely stuff, using it everyday, at worrk and home, non-stop. I reckon i will have finished off the g by Friday. Does anyone have any tips of what i can do to help make myself feeling complertely&nbsp; shit, im fully epecting an to have to suffer, no probs there - just something that i can do, take, think, that will ease that horribly shitty feeling of knowing no gear to help me out, feelimng of restulness, insomnia,&nbsp; sweating, depression etc ....<br /><br />btw taking more H is out of the question, just trying to keep it to once&nbsp; a month dabbling.<br /><br />cheesr in advance for your help !!<br /><br />SJ

				my only honest advice is to try not to do it as much. you are suffering classic withdrawal symptoms, because you are doing it everyday. H is amazing, trust me i understand, but you always have to keep things in control. Doing a g of h a week for 3 weeks isn&#039;t a good thing. I&#039;m not judging, because i dabble in everything, just make sure you don&#039;t lose yourself to that shit. it is quick and you do not see it coming.

				I know that different people handle weed in different ways, but when I used to do H, marijuana was the *last* thing I went near.&nbsp; Nothing like getting stoned and going on a reality trip about the fact that you do H.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even imagine smoking to help deal with withdrawals.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem you&#039;ve got is that once you develop any kind of habit, the amount of time it takes for it to go away (and this is if you&#039;re staying away from opiates 100%) is really really long.&nbsp; <br /><br />To deal with basically mild heroin withdrawal (not to belittle what you&#039;re feeling, it&#039;s fucking awful), I&#039;d recommend just treating the basic symptoms.&nbsp; Take a valium.&nbsp; Take some OTC painkillers if you&#039;ve got joint pain.&nbsp; I used to get relief from getting drunk, though I know some people who didn&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#039;t try to deal with it by taking another form of opiate.&nbsp; Don&#039;t start taking, like, vicodin 5/500s just to get rid of the feeling.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take suboxone, which will get you addicted to suboxone really really quickly.&nbsp; Any of that is the next step towards a worse situation, IMO

				I never found anything that actually relieves withdrawal except more of what you need to avoid.&nbsp; The best thing to do is just kick and get it over with, although benzos help if you have enough of them.&nbsp; They don&#039;t make you feel better, but if you take enough of them, the anxiety will become bearable, and you might actually be able to sleep through the worst of it...&nbsp; But if you have to go to work and function, this isn&#039;t much help at all.<br /><br />Something that works, but you have to be careful, are subs.&nbsp; Right now, you&#039;re body is used to the full agonist joy of heroin.&nbsp; You can wait until you are sick, then snort just enough Suboxone to feel better- less than 2mg should do the trick.&nbsp; The Suboxone will last a really long time- 12 - 24 hours.&nbsp; Wait until you feel sick again before re-dosing, then wait a little longer.&nbsp; Then snort even less Sub than you did the first time.&nbsp; Repeat for a few days, then quit the Subs.&nbsp; You should find that the kick is fairly benign, and nothing you can&#039;t handle.&nbsp; This is a rapid Suboxone assisted detox, and can be nearly painless if done correctly.<br /><br />Just be careful to not stay on Subs for any length of time, and don&#039;t take them before you feel sick.&nbsp; They are addictive, and can precipitate withdrawal (the worst kind, trust me).<br /><br />Good luck to you!

				That&#039;s just a normal withdrawal, not a strong one though(luckily), doing anything everyday=tolerance(addiction)=withdrawals. Happens to me a decent amount because of amazing situations which were impossible to let down. But the fun always must end and a break must be in plan. But only for a lil bit ;P<br /><br />Freedom of self should always be in play.<br /><br />CiF<br /><br />
