				i tried a little tonight, it was good but not great.<br /><br />i did something around 40mg at first over afew mins in very small lines, felt it ok but got abit of a headache and felt like my face was really flushed, like red and hot (common?) got abit introverted (wasnt expecting that haha) just kinda chilled and felt pretty alert.<br />about an hour and a half later i did around 60-70mg and defiantly felt it a lot more, it was pretty good, talkative, active and abit assertive i noticed hehe but still abit underwhelming. i think i just didnt do enough<br /><br />for reference: im a 90kg male, was smoking weed with it but not heaps and im a v regular smoker. its tetravorts stuff but might not be current batch, shipping took forever to aus.<br /><br />thinking about it i really should of made this thread beforehand but ive still got most of the gram left for another time, was keen to hear any advice that anyone who loves coke wanted to give me. ive done abit of reading but still would say i dont know much about it. <br /><br />but yeah advice/thoughts/safety stuff/any info for the coke noob plz haha<br /><br />also i already know having sex on it is the best idea ever :D

				Good coke is really rare, but can be enjoyable now and then. Most of the coke out there tends to be cut to death. The euphoria from good coke is hard to beat (high dose methylone comes really close) but bad coke is just crap. I associate coke with being dirty, greedy, euphoric, filled with false emotions and ending with a tragic crash<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2462.msg20504#msg20504">Quote from: watmm on August 27, 2011, 07:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Unless you have confidence issues, coke is pretty underwhelming for the most part imo.<br />Greed in substance form.

Sneaking key bumps, hoping nobody will see them and ask to try some. Everything is amazing, you are on top of the world until that slight feeling of doubt. Your heart feels a sudden drop and you know the crash is starting so you pour yourself a tall whiskey with a splash of coke and brace yourself. Need I say more?

				the trick is to have cola with alcohol ... your liver processes the coke and the alcohol into a new chemical - cocaethylene <br /><br />cocaethylene has a longer plasma elimination half life than straight cocaine. (Lasts 2-3 times long) <br /><br />it also increases the dopamine reuptake inhibition and reduces the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake that occurs with just coke alone. <br /><br />that&#039;s why sex on coke and alcohol is so good ... and why the euphoria is so intense. <br /><br />you have to be careful though .. cocaethylene is also much more neuro/cardio/hepaptic etc toxic than just plain coke alone ... you&#039;re 3-4 times more likely to die from a drug induced ischemic myocardial infarction (heart attack) as cocaethylene is an even more powerful vasoconstrictor than straight cocaine.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />but its better to burn out .. than to fade away :)<br /><br />grey

				The power is in the subtlety my man. The cocaine experience is just that--underwhelming. What with all the glamor and rumors going around about how great it is, people can&#039;t help but have way too high of expectations for it. For me, it&#039;s basically like operating at 110% after I just found out I aced a really hard test. You&#039;re happy, and you&#039;re on point. Doesn&#039;t seem like much, but wait until a day or two later. You will remember the experience and be like &quot;fuuuuck that was really awesome I need to get more blow.&quot; My problem is, I&#039;m totally fine without it so long as I know it&#039;s readily accessible should I feel like taking some. When it&#039;s not there... that&#039;s when you start missing it like an ex-girlfriend or your childhood pet.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s not even that great, so why can&#039;t I stop thinking about it?!&quot; -every cokehead ever
