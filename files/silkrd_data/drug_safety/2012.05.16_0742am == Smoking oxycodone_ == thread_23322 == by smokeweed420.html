				so after going to my grandmas house this weekend i found a yr old bottle of roxycodone 30mg tablets. score!!!! i tried eating a couple and got pretty high, but i met up with a friend and he suggested we smoked it. i was like wtf??? no way your stupid dude why would i smoke a pill???? anyway long story short we smoked a couple off of foil and it was amazing! super warm rushy high. i was amazed. it even tasted like it was &quot;meant to be smoked&quot; to say the least i was amazed. does anyone here have any experience with this? efficiency compared to other ROA? negative health effects? etc. i really enjoyed it so im smoking a couple right now. it reminds me a lot of smoking heroin #3 im super surprised!

				Never tried it personally, I&#039;ve always gotten more than enough results out of just eating them. <br /><br />I know that smoking them is terribly inefficient, due to Oxycodone being destroyed at a relatively low heat. Also, it&#039;s terribly bad for your lungs, because so little of those pills you&#039;re smoking is actually oxycodone. Most of it is fillers and binders to keep the pill together. Smoking this stuff is absolutely TERRIBLE for your lungs. <br /><br />I am pretty surprised it&#039;s that good, though. If you&#039;re really that interested in still smoking it, try to do an extraction. CWE would work, then throw the aquos layer in a glass pan and let that dry. Scrape up the crystals and smoke that shit. It&#039;s going to be nowhere near pure oxycodone but it&#039;ll be a hell of a lot better than smoking a pill.<br /><br />Cheers.

				Personally I would snort it instead of smoking it. Besides the fact those things are full of wax (which full fuck up your lungs proper good), you are wasting a lot of the goodies. Just make sure you powder it super fine before snorting. Just my two cents. Have fun!!

				Don&#039;t smoke them.&nbsp; It is a waste and gets you hooked way easier just like crack.&nbsp; The high lasts only 10-15 minutes depending on how much you do.&nbsp; But you can just rail it and make it last 1-2 hours or the best way just eat them since the bio-availability is high with oxycontin/oxycodone and you&#039;ll easily get 3-5 hours.&nbsp; It won&#039;t give you that strong rush like smoking it, but it is WAY more better in the long run.<br /><br />If you want to get that rush, I would rather recommend Opana aka oxymorphone(the old formula) which will fuck you up real good for hours from a tiny bit or just straight #3 dope.
