				I believe the flower pipes are for crack.<br /><br />Anyways, you want to take steel wool or a brillow pad. Flame a small piece until it no longer produces fumes. Stuff it into the end. Leave room to add dmt in front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then hold upright with dmt on top of brillow. Gently geat to melt dmt into brillow matrix. Remove heat, let dmt solidify in matrix. When ready to smoke, apply heat/flame to heat up brillow matrix. The heated matrix vaporizes the dmt. Inhale as vapor appears.<br /><br />Google &quot;dmt machine&quot; for.better instructions. The Machine uses the.same concept, only its done.using a modified single shot booze bottle instead of crack pipe. Its supposed to&nbsp; be.one of the best.ways.to smoke dmt. It takes practice but it works.

				is it the kind with a bubble and stem, or is it just a straight tube?&nbsp; the straight tubes are good for crack, but not so good for DMT.<br /><br />definitely do NOT hold your finger over the hole....just hold the flame an inch or so under the spice and roll the pipe around a little so the heat spreads out a little.&nbsp; once it starts forming a heavy vape start sucking on that pipe for as long as you can.&nbsp; if it stops vaporizing, add a little bit more heat but don&#039;t burn it.<br /><br />my first breakthroughs were from one lonnnggg giant hit off a meth pipe, but i do have a very large lung capacity.&nbsp; so its possible.<br /><br />good luck!

				I&#039;ve had excellent luck with my meth pipe. I just hold the flame an inch or so from the bulb until it starts to liquify and keep heating it only until it produces a thin vapor. I inhale through my mouth and out through my nose continuously until the open eye hallucinations become apparent. Usually the pipe takes on a different visual character. Hard to explain. Open eye DMT visuals are very unique.
