				I bought some 2C-B from Ivory on recommendations as it seems to be the best. Will be trying it later this week and will do a detailed report for here. I&#039;ve never taken it before, normally stick to MDMA and LSD myself. I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how to take it (for example can I add it to a small bit of drink and quickly down it all like I do MDMA?) or do I HAVE to put it in a capsule? Some people even suggest sniffing (insufflating) it?<br /><br />Also what dose should I take?

Can such a small dose really be that effective? Also since Ivory&#039;s seems to be very pure/strong would 23mg be too much?<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of conflicting advice online, I&#039;ve tried searching the forums here but come up dry, doesn&#039;t seem like 2C-B is a particularly search friendly term.<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :)

				Hey there, 2C-B is a great chemical! To answer your questions:<br /><br />I&#039;d take it by putting the powder into a gelcap and swallowing it on an empty stomach, or mixing it into a shot glass with distilled water in it and drinking it down. Plugging works well too (up the butt), but is not desirable by many. Plugging essentially reduces the dose by half.<br /><br />As for weighing, get yourself a nice milligram scale, and don&#039;t even attempt to eyeball a dose. This chemical has a high dose-response curve. Being just a few milligrams off can drastically change the experience.<br /><br />I&#039;d shoot for 28-30mg for a strong but great experience! Any time I take less than 25mg I&#039;m a little disappointed.

				Hello mate as said above, a Good milligram scale is a must! nothing cheap if your paying less then $100 then your asking for trouble, most people wouldnt be happy with a scale even at that price, invest now and save messing up your dose.<br /><br />All my caps are at 30mg and people either just swallow it/drink it/snort it. Personally i like to drink it mixed with some fruit juice. Snorting it in-ceases the strength also snorting a 30mg dose will give you a great night ;)<br /><br />So in short, get a good scale, if you cant afford a decent scale, you might be best suited to measuring it volumetrically. If you do plan on capping it up shoot me a PM if you need some advice.

				Thanks for all the advice guys, I probably would have taken an excessive dose without it so thank you. I&#039;ve ordered some high quality accurate to 0.001mg scales as well so good point there too. It seems like pretty good value for money, as 500mg should last me just over 16 doses.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to compile a definite guide of all drug taking related information for people who may need it for future reference, as most of what I read online about 2C-B seems to be bull.

				i recently had the contents of 2 18-20 mg capsules (mixed it in a drink) although the experience was fun: euphoria and visuals i had a nasty headache the next day which lasted for several hours. So i would definitly not dose too high.

				Good advice from the other posters. Just thought I&#039;d add a few things (and perhaps repeat what they&#039;ve said for emphasis):<br /><br />1. I&#039;ve taken 2C-B the last two weekends, and both times I&#039;ve measured my powder on a milligram scale (definitely a must), mixed it with a little orange juice, and drank it down. I rinse the container/glass with another couple of drinks of OJ just to make sure I&#039;m not missing any residue on the sides. You can put them in gel-caps, but it seems to take longer for the effects to be felt. I definitely agree about taking it on an empty stomach, but eat breakfast and give it a couple of hours to digest so you&#039;re not famished. It&#039;s a short trip, after all, so you don&#039;t need 12 solid hours for the experience. The plateau really only lasts for around 3-5 hours, at least at the levels I&#039;ve taken and with my body chemistry.<br /><br />2. As far as dose goes, people respond differently, so I&#039;d start out with a lower-dose. As the saying goes, you can always take more, but you can never take less once it&#039;s ingested. I started with 20mg, and it was a perfect introduction to a new compound. Granted, it was a light trip, but visuals were definitely there. It was like a taste of the 2C-B experience. Yesterday, I took 25mg, and it was a MUCH stronger trip. On my path, my next dose will be 25mg again so I can become more comfortable with the material before taking it to a higher level. I got mine from gammagoblin, so the doses may not be equivalent.<br /><br />Just for reference, my 20mg dose was purely recreational-feeling. There was no introspection that I could tell, just a novel visual field with patterns running on surfaces, but a mostly clear head. It was a nice, easy plus-two.<br />My 25mg dose was, like I said, much stronger. This time, everything in my visual field was warped/morphing, clouds would take on any form I projected, and the forms would rotate as fully solid three-dimensional cloud-structures. Light poles swayed as if in a breeze, birds left a colored energy trail as they flew through the sky, and I felt infused with positive energy. Music was incredibly intense, and I found that if I let it, my emotions (and the visuals) would be carried away by the music. There was definitely introspection at this level, not forced-seeming, like with LSD, but if you want to you can open yourself up to the experience and examine some pretty deep stuff. Definitely a plus-three.<br /><br />3. As far as snorting it goes, that&#039;s up to you, but this material feels so kind when taken orally that I wouldn&#039;t want to start the trip off with terrible burning in my nasal passages...<br /><br />4. I do feel mild nausea during the transition, but once I start feeling that, I know it&#039;s time to pack a bowl and go outside. :) Pot makes my stomach feel just fine, and in fact, you&#039;ll likely get hungry while you&#039;re tripping, so make sure to have some easy-to-eat but nutritious food already prepared and lots of beverages. Fresh fruit tastes GREAT with 2C-B.<br /><br />And <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since I&#039;m used to taking MDMA 23mg of anything doesn&#039;t sound like a lot to me. Can such a small dose really be that effective?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> You said you take LSD too, I doubt you&#039;d want to take 23mg of that! :P<br /><br />If anything I wrote needs clarification, don&#039;t hesitate to ask away. Either I&#039;ll respond or one of the other well-informed members will be glad to help (or correct me).&nbsp; Be careful and enjoy! :)

				Hey there. Ivory&#039;s 2cb is good stuff, I have already stocked up a second time, any day now...<br />The first time I tried it I eyeballed the dose as carefully as possible by cutting 250mgs into ten lines.&nbsp; I had a couple of friends that wanted to try it also with me, gave one roughly 16mgs, the other one roughly 25 mgs.&nbsp; I decided to dose around 35 mg.&nbsp; Bombed in rizla.&nbsp; We all had a great time, but I was a lot more taken by the drug than my friends who had lower doses.&nbsp; Everyone had fun, but I was truly blown away!&nbsp; Having only had a couple of barely threshold lsd doses before, I knew the 2cb would be great, and that&#039;s exactly how it was.&nbsp; I was getting intense trails from people moving their heads during conversation, and the trees in the yard became animated, seemed alive!&nbsp; Sparkles in the field of vision, kinda like minor static twinkling around in the air and on objects.&nbsp; Also, there&#039;s flashes of colours, like auras when you blink that continue into OEV at times.&nbsp; Good body high too, although by the end of it I feel like i&#039;m more aware of my health shortcomings (mainly cigarettes etc).&nbsp; It&#039;s like, coming down off 2cb I just get the sense that something is unhealthy physically, probably cause it is (smoking is no good, I think I DO want to quit, but I also don&#039;t)<br /><br />Music is great on 2cb too, though not as all-immersive one with the beat as MDMA, the way the music plays almost influences the visuals and mood in great and more subtle ways.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;re experienced with acid, then i&#039;d say, depending on the situation of course, dose 25mg to 30mg and kick start it with a bang!&nbsp; I did and loved it.&nbsp; Now I just need a milligram scale, cause i&#039;m definitely not willing to attempt eyeballing the 2ce I have.&nbsp; Empty stomach, rizla, good dose. 2cb was gentle.

				I agree with the 25-30mg dose as probably optimum but wouldn&#039;t be too paranoid about it.&nbsp; If you don;t have scales and have bought from Ivory, its probably a little overweight, so if you ordered say, 100mg, divide it up into 5 and try that out.<br /><br />I say don&#039;t be too paranoid because I&#039;ve had massively varying dosage sizes and once mistook my 2CB for white MDMA and took a 130mg cap.&nbsp; It was very full-on, but I didn&#039;t have any negative reactions.&nbsp; It was just a bit too overwhelming and so not as enjoyable as a good controlled dose.&nbsp; My sweetspot seems to be 30-45 mg, but other mileages vary.&nbsp; Just experiment until you hit your sweet spot.<br /><br />And enjoy.&nbsp; It&#039;s an awesome drug :)

				It most definitely is. I am the proud owner of another half gram of the stuff as of tonight!&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to hearing how the 2cb goes for you.
