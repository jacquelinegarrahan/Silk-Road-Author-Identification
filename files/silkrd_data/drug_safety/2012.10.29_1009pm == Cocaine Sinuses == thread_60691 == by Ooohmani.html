				Hey so I have gotten bad coke nose ever since I&#039;ve done coke, but in the past it was always a ton of mucus that I could have alleviated with saline drops and a neti pot. The coke nose I got from the two bags I got off SR recently was of a different sort. Like a swollen shut sinus cavity, not much mucus, just severe vasoconstriction. For days I tried different methods of nose clearing (spray, zicam swabs, claratin D) with varying effectiveness. The spray worked at first, but then it stopped working and the zicam swabs started working but they quickly lost effectiveness. Then I took Claratin D and that has worked for the most part for about a week now, but it works more like 7 hours nowadays.<br /><br />If it&#039;s any help Tambourine Man and Mercury 31 are the two people&#039;s coke I have tried from SR and they were both great. They got me super high and feeling good while they lasted.&nbsp; Funny thing is that a gram from Mercury has lasted me 22 days now and each bump ive had was glorious, but since the claratin is becoming less affective I havent been doing it. Shit, I&#039;ll probably still have these last few lines come christmas.<br /><br />So what do people think? <br />Have I just put too much shit in my nose? In all it was only about a gram of blow. The otc shit though, there was a lot of that I put in my nose.<br />

				Coke fucks up your nose.. plain and simple.&nbsp; Its a vasoconstrictor I believe, so it tightens the arteries in your nose.&nbsp; This is my assumption at least.&nbsp; I feel you, because I deal with the same issues.&nbsp; Even &quot;good coke&quot; fucks my nose up for days after use, sometimes a week to fully recover.&nbsp; Antiallergy and decongestants do help.&nbsp; I&#039;m so over it I think I&#039;m done altogether.&nbsp; Ayn way, I&#039;m sure it affects everyone differently, like some people OD more easily than others etc.<br /><br />Consider another reason to stop.. if you are so inclined.

				One more thing that does help is to try to not blow your nose so much the days after.&nbsp; I have found that helps the irritation.

				I fucked up my sinuses like it was my day job for years...<br /><br />The only way I can really breathe through my nose anymore is if I<br /><br />1.&nbsp; sleep with a humidifier<br />2. Sitting in a steam room really helps. Where I live there are fitness centers that have steam rooms with menthol aromatherapy steam that will always set me straight. <br />3. Use the tea kettle with warm salt water and drain that shit out after you&#039;re done with your marching powder.<br /><br />first time I tried coke, bartender said, &quot;hey kid, got the drips? Dip your fingers in that rum and coke, lean your head back and snort a couple drops..&quot; sure enough it washed it all down.

				I fucking hate coke nose with a passion.<br /><br />I remember, years ago, going on a massive bender of high quality gear. Great week, all around, but flushing my nose before sleep lost effectiveness after the first few days. After the bender finished, my nose was fucked for a couple weeks, and I was spending as much time as possible in steaming hot showers. I also used a steaming hot towel on my face for when I wasn&#039;t able to spend long periods of time in said showers. Both of these helped, but I didn&#039;t snort anything for a few months.<br /><br />You have my sympathies, but spare your nose for a while now. I&#039;ve heard warm water and lavender can give a decent cleanse, but I&#039;ve never had lavender on hand to test it myself.

				Yeah i&#039;ve definitely gone on a few benders, which took a few weeks to recover from. Typically not more than two to three weeks though.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just doing a few bumps a day, you can expect your nose to keep bugging you until you stop completely for a little while. Careful with the medicines, though, as they can just make your congestion worse when the meds wear off. It&#039;s cool to use them sometimes, just don&#039;t go overboard. It&#039;ll actually cause more irritation.<br /><br />Best cure is to stop doing it for a few weeks and be sure to clean your sinuses out a few times a day with steam/neti pot.

				Cocaine is a vasoconstrictor, but the type of clogging your suffering from shouldn&#039;t last (especially if a gram has lasted you 22 days!). All the cures I&#039;m going to mention are natural, I firmly believe in the natural approach, and try to avoid OTC medicines if it&#039;s possible. If the clogging has lasted long, it could indicate an infection, a type of sinusitis. You could try washing out (nasal douching) your sinuses with a very week saline solution, by dissolving a level teaspoon of table salt in a glass of warm water, then putting the solution into a dropper bottle (something like this world work well, clearwebalert http://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/S1046087888/LDPE-Spray-Dropper-Bottle.jpg), and inhale a little of the solution, not much is needed to feel the effect, the feeling is a little strange at first, but once your desensitized to it, you&#039;ll find it refreshing. Your aim is to fill your nostril slowly with your head titled backwards, you should feel a lot of relief through this. Another natural cure that might help you greatly is to purchase some Vitamin E capsules, puncture one, and gently drip the Vitamin E oil onto a cotton bud, very gently lubricate the inside of your nose with the oil, I&#039;ve always found this to be very effective, if you don&#039;t like the idea of using a cotton bud you can always use your little finger, but ensure it&#039;s very clean. Tomato juice is another beneficial natural cure, all you need to do is crush up a tomato and add just enough juice to coat the inside of your nose, tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, helping you to heal faster and breathe easier. Hope this helps you, and I wish your sinuses to feel better soon :)

				To add to ^^^, a mix of eucalyptus oil + hot water = very good way of clearing sinus&#039; .&nbsp; Just inhale the fumes.
