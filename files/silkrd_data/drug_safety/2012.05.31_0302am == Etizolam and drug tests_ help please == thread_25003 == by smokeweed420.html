				im in suboxone treatment program and recently have had an intense urge to do some benzos. so i did the sensible thing and got some etizolam thinking ha! that wont show up because its not a benzo. but i started to have doubts in my mind. so my question is: will it show up as benzos? the urine test is a top of the line 12 panel which tests for pretty much everything, and if that is failed the urine is sent to a lab for confirmation and to narrow down the chemical. will it show up as benzos on this test? any feedback is much appreciated

				Most benzondiazepines can be detected in urine samples for at least a few days after use.<br /><br />There are basic tests that just indicate benzo&#039;s, often featured in many drug panel tests commercially available.<br /><br />Some of these tests can tell the difference between generic groups of benzodiazepines as well, often intended to find if the substance is prescribed diazepam or flutinazepam slipped into a drink. <br /><br />Laboratory analysis will in most cases reveal the exact compound or its active metabolites.<br /><br />While etizolam is not a traditional benzodiazepine, it may very well trigger the initial test, and be discovered during more detailed analysis.

				Google is your friend...But to answer you question Etizolam is a thienodiazepine but will still test positive for benzo&#039;s more then likely sadly. There are several forums that have people talking about how it made them fail their drug tests suck&#039;s but it&#039;s true.

				Howdy H4101, Ben and Smokeweed420!<br /><br />Etizolam WILL show ab a benzo on a screening test, and it is readily ID&#039;s as Ezitolam on more exact tests. Acccording to Wikipoedea, it&#039;s 1/2 life is about 8 days, which in practice means you&#039;ll test + for about 2 weeks after taking some of it (I work in a hospital lab, &amp; we do drug screenings bu the 100&#039;s). It SEEMS to be like other &quot;standard&quot; Benzo&#039;s (valium, xanex, ativan, ext) as far as having a good evening, but you can till get got, if you know what I mean (I also have this unfortunate first-hand experience!;)<br /><br />Hope this info helps! - bull3gern
