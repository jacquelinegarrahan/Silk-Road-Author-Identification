				Does such a thing exist?<br /><br />I know the benefit of the syringe filter is sterility, however that is a secondary concern to particulate filtration. <br /><br />I drop my pills into boiling water, most of the little critters are on the outside and killed by the hot water.<br /><br />Anyway, I currently use cotton, or a cigarette filter, and would be very interested in small filters that are single use that can be placed in ones spoon.<br /><br />Does such a thing exist? I have not seen it on SR, and google searches are not being very fruitful.

				I know it&#039;s not what you are asking for exactly, but have you seen this thing? -&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a8d7144d57<br />So, it seems you aren&#039;t interested in wheel filters, and I can&#039;t think of any one time use filter that you would just drop into your spoon -- honestly, a slightly damp and tightly rolled bit of cotton is exactly what you need. Also, NEVER use cigarette filters, they contain very fine particles of fiber glass which can get into your shots and over the long-term this has been shown to cause endocarditis (a heart valve infection). I&#039;ve used qtip or cotton ball cotton, damp and tightly rolled like I said, for the last 7 years shooting dope. I haven&#039;t lost any veins, or gotten a single abscess. Stick with a good clean cotton, new syringe, and WASH YOUR HANDS! You said you use boiling water so you it sounds like you are killing any potential bacteria.

				I only use cigarette filters when I cant get cotton... So thats rare. But it has been done, I like to avoid it, however, if for no other reason than it is a waste of a cigarette.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />My wife works with patients at the local hospital, many of whom are there for iv drug abuse. There is a large group who are there for bacterial or fungal infections. One girl for instance had to have her heart valves replaced, and the anti-fungal medications they gave her killed her kidneys. So she is a young lady, under 30 years of age, who has to be on dialysis for the rest of her life.<br /><br />There are also folks there who have suffered strokes and stuff from particulate build up.<br /><br />I am just scared of suffering a similar fate. It does give me some piece of mind knowing that some of these people are so hard up that they use their own spit as the medium in which they dissolve their pills.<br /><br />I think I am going to modify my regiment if I cant find the proper filter. Perhaps crushing the pills, placing in some coffee filter, then adding water to the spoon and filtering with cotton. <br /><br />Anyone know of any negatives in using coffee filters in preparation of their hit? I suppose it would be best to use the brown, unbleached filters.

				Why don&#039;t you use 0.22 micron wheel filters?
