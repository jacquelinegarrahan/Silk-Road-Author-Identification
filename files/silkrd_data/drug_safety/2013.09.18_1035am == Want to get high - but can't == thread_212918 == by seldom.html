				It&#039;s been ages since i had a nice high (MDMA).<br />A round birthday is coming up and i am looking for a substance for a good, euphoric turn.<br />So far i&#039;ve tried opioids (Opium, Oxycodone) and Cocaine.<br />This stuff did not produce any euphoric moments for me.<br />I am on SSRIs (antidepressants), maybe they are interfering.<br />Weed and alcohol is working like always, but i am looking for something special.<br />So any recommendations? (no psychedelics/dissociatives please, don&#039;t want a bad trip).

				SSRIs are going to kill MDMA, LSD, Shrooms, etc. Commonly, when people want to enhance drug affects, they use MAOIs, but this can kill you on SSRIs.&nbsp; Taking a huge dose of MDMA may also cause serotonin syndrome, as it works by increasing serotonin, yet your body cannot take it in (it is being blocked by your SSRI). <br /><br />Opiates, cocaine, and marijuana will not suffer this attenuation. They will be all that will work for you while on SSRIs, so hand up the MDMA.

				MDMA seems the only thing left that qualifies. 2C-B maybe but that will not make you that euphoric, if you want to cuddle with your girlfriend at your birthday it will be nice. At least you&#039;ll have an amazing body feeling which could also push you more into a euphoric state. It is a psychedelic though. You don&#039;t want psychedelics but if it&#039;s a round birthday and you want something special as you say I would strongly recommend LSD.

				Yes indeed 2c-b is some freaky shit. Long time ago I remember taking it. No euphoria in deed. Only the shadows became freaky.

				Thanks for the replies.<br />So not much left for me to try.<br />LSD, i did it once. It was horrible.<br /><br />I am thinking:<br />- Meth: Could this even work if cocaine does not do anything for me except rising my Noradrenaline.<br />- Adderall: Can you even get high from it?

Maybe just avoid drugs until you are off SSRI&#039;s.<br />Cocaine &amp; Meth/Amphetamine shouldn&#039;t interfere with it as t hey work primarily with dopamine, not serotonin.<br />But you said cocaine did not work for you. Cocaine is something which can be subtle t he first few times you use it. You need to &quot;look&quot; for the high.<br />It doesn&#039;t smack you in the head like MDMA, etc. Or the cocaine was bad quality. Good cocaine is so good.
