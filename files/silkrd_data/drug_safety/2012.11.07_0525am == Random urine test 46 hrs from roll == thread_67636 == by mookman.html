				I took 1/4th of a riddler(?&#039;s)&nbsp; probably about 50-60 mg. I found out I have a random UA at my hospital I will have about 46 hours in after I railed (snorted) the roll. haha I will see about 10 negative feedbacks but I want to know if I will be okay. I have been drinking a shit ton my urine is clear and am going to be taking some stuff to make it yellow. I am thinking I will be fine but want some assurance, and I know silk road is the place to be with the pros that know there stuff :).&nbsp; Any advice or assurance you can truthfully give me? haha. Love SR and you guys. <br /><br />Age : 23&nbsp; &nbsp;height :5&quot;8&nbsp; weight: 160 body: average flat stomach&nbsp; &nbsp; umm I will check this later haha need some sleep got the test in 17hrs.

				Im quite sure you will pass your test! My advice is drink lots of juices and excercise just to be careful. you can never be too safe. The average is 2-5 days, but that is based off an average dose that is mostlikely higher then you ate. and that is without excercise and extreme ammounts of fluids. Best of luck, please update after your drug test!
