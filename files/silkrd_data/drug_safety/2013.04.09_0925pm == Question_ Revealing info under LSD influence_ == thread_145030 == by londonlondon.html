				hey guys,<br />im wondering, is it possible that I may reveal underlying info to someone while under the influence of LSD?<br /><br />so you can better understand were im coming from:<br />im going to be tripping with my sister who I trust in all ways, except one thing, and its telling her that I dropped out of college recently.<br />dont want it affecting her idea of college as she really looks up to me.<br />would it be possible that I reveal this as a result of &#039;ego death&#039; or what-not? or is it possible to keep that locked inside me?<br />cheers<br />

				I doubt you&#039;ll feel the impulse to tell her, that&#039;d be more of an MDMA or meth thing.<br /><br />But I do feel the guilt will lead you into a nervous, anxious bad trip.

				thanks for both your great answers<br /><br />so ego death does not give this feeling of disinhibition like the one you get from MDMA? i thought that lacking the presence of the ego i could be &#039;compelled&#039; or wouldnt care about sharing such information. i doubt ill be thinking about it before the trip, but since ive heard LSD brings out things that are in the sub-conscious...<br />so it is possible to make some rational decisions regarding something id like to share and wouldnt like to?<br /><br />@zvp1014: i had a feeling this would come up. the anxious/nervous possible &#039;bad&#039; trip answer. im sure its not something i really understand yet, since i dont know how feelings are affected during a trip, but would it be possible that it works the opposite way? the fact that im &#039;hiding&#039; this from her for her own benefit? that im doing it out of good intentions, rather than trying to conceal it for the wrong reasons. could this actually give me a good positive feeling?<br /><br />sorry if this is too many questions haha<br />cheers guys

I was recently tripping on LSD and was contacted and engaged in conversation with someone who didn&#039;t know I was tripping. Man the truth just poured out. I didn&#039;t have the heart to think things out, if I had been sober I am certain this would have gone differently. But my tripping mind just said what it thought. It went well for both parties.

				The last time I tripped on LSD I was with my bro and my trip kinda went left and before I knew it I was talking about all kinds of shit and problems that I felt like I always realized were bothering me but never really realized how much it was bothering me. It was crazy, I kept trying to stop but I just kept talking. I think depending on rather you have a good or bad trip depending on how much you take you still will probably feel obligated to talk about a lot of things. I&#039;m not a very social or energetic person I&#039;m more laid back and quiet but it really takes you there man really gets you going maybe if I were around people I didn&#039;t know I wouldn&#039;t have talked as much but since it was someone close to me it was even easier than it would normally be to talk about and mention a lot of things that I did.

				The CIA was interested for a while in counter espionage tactics using LSD including brainwashing and forced defection of Russian spies . Just look up Project MKULTRA. The US govt gets up to some truly horrific shit&nbsp; &gt;:(.

				do not worry about this, if you and your sister trip together, it will all come out and it will all be good, it will not necessarily jade her view of higher education, you love each other and the trip will most likely only make you closer, forget this talk of ego death, as one responder said that is for hi doses and other times. Enjoy the ride, your gonna think your ass off brother, it will be wonderful&nbsp; :) Love and Light

				lsd tends to only cause ego death on high doses. you will most likely not experience that unless you are extra sensitive to psychedelics.
