				Title: <strong>Morphine Sulfate ER ABG-15 Rectal Use?</strong><br />

				So I have a large quantity of Morphine Sulfate 15mg ER (dark Purple ABG-15) (Watson/Rhodes generic brand).<br /><br />http://anonym.to/?http://www.drugs.com/imprints/abg-15-15731.html<br /><br />I&#039;m in a lot of pain and I know the bio availability of morphine used rectally is 80 % compared to the bio availability of morphine taken orally is 10%, 90% of the drug is destroyed by your liver. I&#039;ve tried scratching the purple waxy/film coating off and chopping it into a fine powder and then trying to dry it out under a lamp but still when I add it to hot water in a small mL syringe it gels up, and I don&#039;t think that is defeating the time release and that the gel would be absorbed properly through this route of administration. <br /><br />Does anyone know any good ways to use these rectally? I never thought I&#039;d ask that question, but when you are in serious pain you NEED the most pain relief you can get from the meds that are available to you. Any help beating the time release on these would be much appreciated and I will not resort to using needles to IV these...I&#039;ve heard they ruin your veins and that is only going to make my problems worse.<br /><br />Thanks for any help/advice!

				well, i&#039;ve never done this, but get a little turkey baster, not that actual size, but the ones they use for science, theyre really small, prepare your drugs, suck up the drugs in said baster, and you may want to be lubed up, face down so gravity helps and get it deep in there and squeeze away, i have never done this, i just know how to ._.

				Just inject without the needle in your ass. It&#039;s the best place. Lot&#039;s of bloodveins there, to absorb the opiate.<br />Make sure the morphine is dissolved, otherwise it could block the nozzle. <br />So inject yourself in your ass without the needle.<br /><br />Most shooters have lost veins, just from being careless.<br />Injected in your ass it will enter your bloodstreaam too.<br />No loss of breathing smoke out.<br /><br />I do know that the acid in your stomach breaks one acetylgroup from the morphine, so you will not have di-acetylmorphine, just morphine.<br />What the liver does with the opiate has nothing to do with the way you took your dope.<br />Dope that have entered your blood, will pass your liver, no matter if you did smoke it or inject it intra muscular or intravenous. Save your veins and use your ass. No needle in your ass !, just the nozzle
