				I am wondering if it will be a waste to take a hit of acid now because of my tolerance.

				you should wait at least a week between trips for maximum effect. taking psychedelics more often than that is just a waste, as your tolerance won&#039;t be back to baseline that quickly--of course dmt and 5-meo-dmt are exceptions.

				You could take LSD after 48 hours and still experience effects, but you will have to take a much larger dose than you normally would (without tolerance) to achieve the same level of tripping.&nbsp; And, even if you up the dose to match your baseline experience there will still be a lack of &quot;magic&quot; as opposed to taking a comparable trip with no tolerance.<br /><br />So basically as @moonflower said, it would be a waste.<br /><br />I read a while back that LSD tolerance (no other chemicals involved) roughly follows this schedule:<br />- After 24 hours (1 day): 4x original dose is needed<br />- After 48 hours (2 days): 3x original dose is needed<br />- After 72 hours (3 days): 2x original dose is needed<br />- After 1 week (7 days):&nbsp; 1.5x original dose is needed<br />- After 2 weeks (14 days):&nbsp; 1.1x original dose is needed<br /><br />What that means is if you take, say, 100ug at T:0h, and you want to have a similarly intense experience at T:+24h, then you will need to take 400ug.&nbsp; If you, instead, take 100ug at T:0h, and you want a similarly intense trip at T:+48h, then you will need 300ug, etc.&nbsp; This only applies to LSD after taking LSD (ie. not cross tolerance with other psychedelics), and it only accounts for a single second trip, taken some amount of time after a single first trip.&nbsp; In other words, taking LSD every 24 hours for 3 days and adjusting the dosage appropriately each day will not give the same experience at day 3 as you would get if you just waited 3 days from the initial dosage.&nbsp; <br /><br />But that being said, I have found this guideline to be fairly accurate.&nbsp; I have taken trips 1-, 2-, 3-, 7- and 14-days apart over the years, and the multipliers are pretty accurate.&nbsp; But like I said, taking that much of any psychedelic does lead to a loss of magic that might never come back (the &quot;magic&quot; doesn&#039;t depend so much on dosage as it does on how you are trained to experience the trip).&nbsp; So putting aside my rather wasteful and stupid patterns of LSD use in the past, I have to recommend that you trip no more than once a month if you want to get the most out of your experiences, and keep your brain functioning normally.&nbsp; No more often than once every 2 weeks.&nbsp; Anything more often than that and you are willingly wasting molecules of LSD.

				Wazup7,<br /><br />Thanks for this table, and your own personal share. <br /><br />I wasted 2g of Golden Teacher Mushrooms last week because i had done 25i NBOMe a few days prior, the mushrooms done jack shit! I have also read about cross-tolerance of acid vs shrooms, and the other trypts vs psychs.&nbsp; They may be different trips, but all trips lead to the same part of the brain, and so I now save my chems and just assume the 2 week rule applies to all &#039;trippy&#039; substances. Plus, it makes it a little more special. i am someone who will use until it&#039;s all gone, so the natural buffer built into the brain on psychs is good for me personally.<br /><br />m.

				Many people attribute the natural tolerance for psychedelics to the reason for it&#039;s low abuse potential, as compared to other addictive drugs.&nbsp; If you wanted to trip every other day, for example, then after 2 weeks you would need to take 243 hits to feel the same as the first trip at 1 hit.&nbsp; At some point after doing that for enough time, re-dosing any amount would likely produce only a negligible effect (but you would at that point almost certainly be too tripped out and disconnected to even notice or care).<br /><br />I went through a phase years ago where I would trip every week.&nbsp; I had a large enough supply at a low enough price that the cost didn&#039;t bother me, and it showed me how strong the tolerance really is.&nbsp; Well more accurately, abstaining for years after that pattern of use, and then tripping again no more often then twice a year, made me realize how strong the tolerance is once it has developed.&nbsp; Avoiding tolerance absolutely gives me more out of my psychedelic use all around.&nbsp; Spending a greater amount of time planning your trip will yield a trip that is 10x more satisfying in the end.&nbsp; It lets you extend your stash and it saves your brain (if you believe like I do, that using brain-altering drugs less often is ultimately better for one&#039;s brain).&nbsp; But the fact that I am using less often is more than made up for by the fact that my trips are so much more gratifying.<br /><br />So with all of my past experience, if you are the type of individual that loves psychedelics, my best advice is to use them as sparingly as you can.&nbsp; That IMHO is the best way to optimize the general quality my psychedelic experiences, and that&#039;s the reason I choose to use psychedelics that way.&nbsp; And of course, YMMV--you may prefer longer periods of tripping more often, where I prefer a single intense experience surrounded by longer periods of normality.&nbsp; That is totally cool.&nbsp; I only wanted to share my thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />(Well, that, and life, which moves on.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t trip every week like I used to even if I chose to do so today.&nbsp; I envy anyone who can honestly say that they are able to trip week after week and will be able to continue forever.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t do that, but having that kind of freedom does sound extremely appealing...)

				Psilocin doesn&#039;t affect 5-HT2A tolerance that much. You can wait a week before taking LSD to be 100% sure.

				Howsabout LSD and 5-meo-mipt?&nbsp; I understand the 5meomipt being a tryptamine will have a cross tolerance with LSD, so it&#039;s be a total waste to usem in consecutive days right?<br />Also, how would 2cb be affected?<br /><br />Will probably have at least a few days, more likely a week between them.<br /><br />:)

				I believe there IS a crosstolerance between shrooms and LSD, however it&#039;s not as great as if it was a tolerance from lsd to lsd.
