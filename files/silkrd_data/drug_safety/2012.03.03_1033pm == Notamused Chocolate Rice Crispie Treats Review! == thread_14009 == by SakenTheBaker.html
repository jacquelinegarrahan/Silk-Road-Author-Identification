				Wellâ€¦..first time looking through Silk Road I thought I&#039;d go for some edibles as smoking itself doesn&#039;t really get me that high. This guy named notamused had these tasty edibles that caught not only my eye, but my tastebuds even without tasting them. 200mg of hash I assume is 2grams of hash so thats a double win win for me! Went right ahead and ordered my first batch. Process of getting it shipped only took 2 days, and took 3 days to get here. Not too bad! Packaging is pretty damn good swell, couldn&#039;t even smell it. I had to go ahead and start nomming, so I started with one before a big job. Next 25minutes later it started coming onto me hard and I didn&#039;t see it coming. Next 30 minutes later the big body high and big head high got even more intense to where I had to lay down and I had no power in me to refuse my comfy bed. I&#039;ve tried a lot of edibles from the medical shops and I can say that THESE are A++++ coming from someone who has high tolerance. I&#039;ll be returning not amused, but I AM AMUSED WITH YOUR EDIBLES!

				Well, apart from a shaky grasp of the metric system (200mg = 0.2g), not a BAD review. Just kinda unpleasant to read because of how its formatted and rambly.
