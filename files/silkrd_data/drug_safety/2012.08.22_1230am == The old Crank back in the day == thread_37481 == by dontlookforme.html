				What was that stuff we snorted back in the 80s called crank or crystal?&nbsp; Was it really meth? or was it simply amphetamine?&nbsp; What is the difference in speed paste, meth and crystal meth?

				Crank was racemic methamphetamine, meaning that it consisted of 50% l-methamphetamine and 50% d-methamphetamine, which are mirror images of eachother. It was usually synthesized from the precursor P2P.<br /><br />In contrast, the meth of the 90&#039;s onward was mostly synthesized from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA (due to wide availability of those precursors on OTC diet pills). It was composed of d-methamphetamine exclusively. It&#039;s supposed to be more euphoric and as a result has higher abuse/addiction potential. This crystalline form can be smoked (vaporized), which makes it particularly addictive because it gets delivered to the blood/brain much faster than snorting or swallowing. For whatever reason, this method caught on in the 90&#039;s. <br /><br />Crank was mostly pushed to the wayside in favor of this because it was easier to obtain precursors and it was more potent.<br /><br />The different ratios of d and l- methamphetamine produce slightly different experiences. The preference for one or the other is subjective.<br /><br />What it ratios it consists of these days seems to be variable according to subjective and anecdotal reports, at least according to the SR review forum. There&#039;s been quite a bit of discussion and speculation but members consistently report 2 distinct experiences among batches received from SR-- dubbed either &quot;speedy&quot; or &quot;elixor of sex&quot; by forum members.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most members attribute the former to higher l-meth content&nbsp; (similar to crank)&nbsp; and the latter to d-meth, though impurities, cutting agents, and individual biochemistry could also be the culprit in subjective differences. <br /><br />The relative lack of all precursors in the US and purported bulk of production by superlabs in mexico make either type a possibility. Any that is produced in the US is most likely to be d-meth because ephedrine/pseudoephedrine are still available but to a lesser degree than in the past (while P2P would be extremely difficult to procure in any quantity).

Atleast, so the story goes.

				excellent info le botbahn, thank you<br /><br />i always heard d-amph was the most desirable (euphoric, not &quot;jittery&quot;) amphetamine salt, hence the disparity in price between dexedrine and adderall

				D-meth is the one that is desired - L -meth is useless and you can buy it OC in vicks inhalers, http://scienceblogs.com/moleculeoftheday/2006/10/27/lmethamphetamine-would-you-bel/<br />Ive always considered the l meth to be counteractive to my high, we used to call the stuff &quot;Nope&quot;, because it may have looked like dope,taste, smell,like dope, but it was &quot;N&quot;ot d&quot;OPE&quot;.<br />You can see the shit when you melt n recrystalize shit in a pipe, some shards will head off left n some right,pinwheel (crap). For how pretty they make it nowadays, it isnt shit compared to the stuff we did in the 80s n early 90s and if you did that p2p shit back in the day (true Crank) you did better cut than what passes for dope today. I guarantee
