				Hi , <br /><br />Some people I know recently took one 10mg dose of 2ce each. 3/5 were sick with stomach pains. And only 2/5 only had visuals. So , I decided to do one dose and had the time of my life , with mad visuals&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So , Im just wondering if other people have experienced sickness or anything similar with 2ce as I would like to get to the bottom of why these people didn&#039;t have a good time.

				With the 2c drugs there is a lot of variation in terms of how each individual one affects different people in terms of body-load/nausea, though there are some like 2c-e where negative effects are more common.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;ve only tried 2c-e once and it made me very sick, but I know plenty of people who feel no nausea at all with it.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that you can lessen the nausea by plugging it (taking your dose rectally), but never tried it myself.

				who did you get it from?<br /><br /><br />sounds weird that many ppl got sick of such a small amount.<br /><br /><br />it still amazes me that i did 40mg my first time, didnt really feel anything for 3 hours then snorted 20mg, felt good then. then ate another 40mg a couple hours after and i barely saw anything or tripped my balls off. i know it was pure 2ce<br /><br /><br />maybe im just insane? haha 100mg is like one of the biggest doses ever, people get sick off that much. all that happened with me was i got lost inside of my mind..not that trippy really since i can do that with any other drug and meditation <br /><br /><br />i hope you figure out why your friends got sick. that really is unfortunate <br /><br />

				All Im going to say is I got them from a reliable source. <br /><br />Californeeya you must be mad&nbsp; :P I tripped hard just off 10mg (3rd time doing 2ce)<br /><br /><br />I would understand if one or two people where sick because they where under the influence of alcohol , but a few people took one cap completely sober. :/....strange<br />

				yeah man, that is what i have been told. <br /><br />i was surprised that 40mg didnt do much after 2 hours of waiting around so i snorted the 20mg, ouch, then i started tripping nicely, it was like i was looking at the entire world through someone, somthing, else&#039;s eyes. pretty damn neat! but no fantastic visuals or anything like i had expected. so naturally i took 40mg more. that got me to a weird place, i couldnt control my thoughts, like i would think about stuff and had no control over it. whatever popped into my head popped into my head. some really fucked up things started coming into my mind (gore,famine,suffering) i always end up thinking about the rest of the world when im on psychedelics, so this was natural, except i couldn&#039;t get my mind off it. really annoying. next thing i know i woke up. <br /><br /><br />i have been nervous to try it again due to my results last time. but it is definitely an interesting psychedelic<br />

				In my experience it is not uncommon to experience stomach discomfort on the come-up, but that is true for many psychedelics. Strange that they did not experience any visual effects though.<br /><br />40mg itself is a very large dose of 2C-E. 100 mg would be a transcendental out-of-this-world blackout experience. Either something was up with your scale or something was up with your substance.

				agreed, theres no way on gods green earth that if that was proper pure 2ce that you killed 100mgs in a night, youd have fried your brains, even starting out with 40mgs oral is rather mental if you ask me, especially for a first time (even the reports in pihkal top out at 25mgs) if its pure even 10-15mgs snorted should be a mighty intense experience, and from talking to nomad 5mgs chased off foil will have you tripping balls pretty damn hard too, im willing to wager you werent getting the real deal there dude. that said i noticed some massive variances in what 2cb did to people, 2 of my friends only took 18mgs and tripped really hard, while the other two had much less visually off 24mgs (i dont factor into that experiment as i snorted most of mine, much more visual that way it seems to me) so it seems natural tolerance does vary quite drastically with the 2c compounds but i dont know that itd be drastically enough for you to need 100mgs unless youre the size of andre the giant or something!

				well the 2ce was from missit. so maybe thats why?<br /><br />i thought that it might not be pure since people talk about losing connection with this earth on 40mg, but i will have to order some more and see for myself.<br /><br /><br />guess i know what im putting in my cart today :P

				I find taking ginger root before psychedelics always helps keep nausea under control.<br /><br />25mg diphenhydramine (Benadryl) also helps greatly with 2c-e bodyload.
