				The other night I received 1g of MDPV, and decided to try it out later that evening. Just to mention, I am very much still a drug noob - I have only done MDMA a few times (although in high doses), and even weed is still pretty new to me! So my following description about how the trip went might be a bit dull/uninformative at points, but hopefully it&#039;ll at least have some value. There isn&#039;t a tonne of information out there about this drug after all.<br /><br />Brief summary: 60mg insufflated - 6 hours of fun and feeling good, but followed by a relatively sudden comedown and ~20 hours of unpleasurable, strongly lingering effects (mild headaches, brain feeling totally exhausted/fried and like pure slush (comedown effects I guess, but much harsher than from my experiences with MDMA), nausea &amp; vomiting, and high heart rate / speedy, buzzing, restless body making sleep near enough impossible)<br /><br />At around 8pm, I weighed out 12mg off the stuff, split it roughly in half, and snorted it. I felt virtually nothing for a few minutes, so I had the other half. Still nothing majorly noticeable, so I had another roughly 10mg (I had accidentally dropped some on my desk, but it looked around the same amount that I&#039;d taken so far). Started to feel it a bit, and whatever I was feeling seemed perfectly nice/enjoyable... so I go ahead and snort another 20mg. Now I can feel it, and I certainly like it. My mood felt lifted and quite liked the speedy buzz it was giving me, so I have another 20mg. I very nearly had another 20mg, but decided to let what I&#039;d taken so far settle in first (and thank fuck I did).<br /><br />I was on my own, in my bedroom, on my PC, so I wasn&#039;t exactly in the most suitable of scenarios for a drug like this, but it was still fun.<br />I started writing a facebook message to my best mate, which quickly spiraled into lengthy ramblings. I was very very talkative (...in an online form) - I was typing very fast, literally every thought that went through my mind. I just enjoyed letting it all out. I felt very open, much like the way MDMA makes you feel, and the message I was sending soon went into &quot;deep&quot; personal subjects. I felt very introspective.<br /><br />I decided to transfer my message to MS Word, in case my internet fucked up and I lost everything I had typed, and just kept writing. Before I know it... I&#039;ve been typing for 6 hours. My word count was up to like, 9000. (There is another guy&#039;s trip report on this forum that he wrote while on MDPV, and he felt the same - just typing and typing - every thought that came into his head, with most of it, like mine, probably not being very coherent or structured, with no points tying together... just endless rambling).<br /><br />Up until that point, everything was good. I felt good mentally, and physically; I was surprised how similar it felt to MDMA, albeit with more speedy-ness. It was very nice. All in all, no negatives so far. Good stuff.<br /><br />But over the next two hours, I finished my message to my friend (11,460 words in the end...) - but it had started to get harder to concentrate. My brain started feeling quite frazzled, and my mood had dived a bit (partly due to a realisation I had while talking about this &quot;deep&quot; personal subject - but probably also due to the NDRI effects wearing off). Then I came on here and attempted to write a trip report, which I couldn&#039;t finish, because as I was typing it I started to feel really quite bad. I heaved once, so got up and headed for the bathroom. I heaved a few times on the way, the last one throwing up into my mouth. I managed to reach the toilet and spat it out, then stood up straight (for some stupid reason...) and then projectile vomited around, and onto, then into the toilet. Once I had finished being sick (not long), I felt a bit better, and cleaned it all up. Then I decided to just get in bed. I noticed I was a little bit dizzy too while I was down there, and that my vision seemed very skewed. Everything looked weird, at odd angles or out of proportion slightly - much like when your glasses are bent out of shape slightly by accidentally sitting on them (if you wear glasses...)<br /><br />This is where it was really unenjoyable. My head ached, mainly because my brain felt so fried it was unreal. It felt so heavy in my head, and actually felt like it was pushing down onto the bridge of my nose. I started to feel nauseous again too, and I desperately just wanted to sleep it off. But that&#039;s where the peeve was a total fucking bastard. My heart rate was still sky high, and my body was buzzing, and every time I closed my eyes, I was bombarded with some sort of CEV&#039;s of white static like you see on TV&#039;s, but morphing and moving (which didn&#039;t help with my nausea), or just general white flashing/flickering. I couldn&#039;t sleep. I couldn&#039;t get up (nausea). I couldn&#039;t do anything (brain fried, can&#039;t concentrate)... so what the fuck do I do? I just had to wait it out like a zombie, trying to calm my restless body and to soothe my aching fried brain, while battling the nausea and not being able to close my eyes.<br /><br />And it lasted forever! At least it fucking felt like it. My heart rate was still above normal 24 hours after taking the stuff. I was in bed for over 16 hours, and managed to get some really staggered, short bursts of restless, useless sleep, and still felt nauseous after all that time (but then managed to eat a slice of toast, which helped take the nausea away for a bit). I got up a couple of times during that time and checked my PC, but my vision was very blurry for the first few hours; almost double vision... and trying to focus on the tiny words on screen made me feel sick very quickly.<br /><br />And even now, after about 5 hours of sleep, nearly 36 hours after I took it, I&#039;m still feeling a tad nauseous after all this typing. I think my body is still a bit speedy too (just as I was writing that sentence I noticed I was sitting on my chair swinging my legs side to side, which I never do normally).<br /><br />So yeah, I learnt to treat this drug with more respect, especially because I now know that it&#039;s hard to know you&#039;ve taken too much, until ~8 hours later when it all goes downhill. 60mg was too high a dosage for me. The high was fun, but those lengthy drawn out, conflicting negatives were just not worth it. It wouldn&#039;t be so bad if I had nausea/headache alone, and could sleep it off... or just the speediness, and could accept I&#039;m staying awake and just do stuff until it wears off - but I had both, each negative being the other ones worst enemy.<br /><br />I&#039;m writing this one down as a bad experience. I know I didn&#039;t talk much about the positives over those first 6 hours, but the negatives that followed, mainly because I wasn&#039;t expecting them to last that long, just outweighed the positives this time around. I&#039;ve got lots left, so I&#039;ll probably try it out again in a smaller dose at some point. Hopefully it won&#039;t drag on for so long.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re trying MDPV for the first time; show it a bit more respect than I did. Just do 20mg as a maximum, and see how it goes, because if you take too much. you might not know it until hours later when it&#039;s too late to do anything about it.<br /><br />Hopefully that wasn&#039;t just garbage info. I know I&#039;m still a drug noob and that most of you will have much worse &quot;horror stories&quot; than this, but every little helps I guess.

				Even 20mg is a high fucking dose, if you&#039;re taking it intranasally.<br />Better to just stay away from this awful drug.

				Yeah, this is a ridiculously high dose. I usually only take 3-5 mg at a time nasally or sublingually. What you did, sir, was utter madness. Be careful and stay safe, OP. (Not trying to sound condescending, just shocked)&nbsp; :-[

				Did you happen to take any cold medicine or anti histamines such as benydryl? How do you know you used 60mgs? You have a scale? You don&#039;t have to lie, there have been days i have eyeballed mdpv. It will defiantly bite you if you&#039;re not careful. I do have good news though. I used mdpv for over a year and a half and i get worse palpitations from caffeine. I&#039;m not saying that mdpv is safe, but after use of mdpv daily for over a year and a half. There hasn&#039;t been any long term damage. (that has presented itself yet.) I can imagine tripping off mdpv in the higher doses is over whelming for someone that hasn&#039;t used that many drugs to begin with. Why did you choose mdpv so soon in your drug career. I had to use meth off and off for several months before i grew the balls to touch mdpv. It&#039;s one of the drugs i had more respect for before trying than any other drug. The highest dose i consumed that i can remember was 100 mgs IV. My pulse was elevated, but never reached dangerous levels. Blood pressure managed to stay stable. So from my observations mdpv is under respected because of it being an rc. We won&#039;t know what harm or damage this chemical has done for years. We are the rats indeed.

				Nope, I didn&#039;t have any cold medicine or anything like that around the time of taking it.<br /><br />Yeah I have some scales and weighed out each dose, plus a bit of accidental spillage, but only a tiny amount.<br /><br />I chose MDPV so soon mainly because I was looking for things that might make me feel good/talkative/confident etc. - and have seen a few comments online where people say they&#039;ve used it as a substitute for cocaine (which I&#039;m yet to try). But coke is too expensive for me at the moment, and MDPV is among the cheapest drugs available on SR in the UK right now.
