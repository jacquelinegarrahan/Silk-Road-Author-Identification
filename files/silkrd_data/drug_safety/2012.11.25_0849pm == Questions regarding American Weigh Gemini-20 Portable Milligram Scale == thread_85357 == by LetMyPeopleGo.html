				Hello everyone!&nbsp; I have a couple of questions regarding the scale mentioned in the thread title.<br />Since I know a lot of you here at The Silk Road actually have these (They seem to be the most popular option among RC users), I figured I&#039;d come on here and ask. <br /><br />I am planning on buying this scale due to it&#039;s extreme affordability and what seems to be seemingly accurate. <br /><br />First off, how accurate would you say it is?&nbsp; Would you be able to say it&#039;s accurate up to 5mg? Or higher?&nbsp; I&#039;m worried about this because I&#039;m going to be using it for very potent chemicals and I can&#039;t take the risk of weighing some and it being far more than I wanted.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. For those that have dealt with RC&#039;s and the like... how sticky is the plate that lays on the actual scale?&nbsp; Do you have a problem with chems sticking so much that you basically lose some on the plate?&nbsp; Obviously I don&#039;t want to lose that much chem due to sticking so I&#039;d like to know what may be a better option... say putting aluminum foil on top of the plate so that I can just lift the foil from the plate and therefor no sticking! Since foil doesn&#039;t really allow stickyness ;) <br /><br />Would appreciate a bit of feedback as I am planning on purchasing this scale soon along with the chems! <br /><br />Thanks much!

				don&#039;t use the plate that comes with the scale...it&#039;s unbalanced and makes the scale fluctuate...<br /><br />instead use a glass vial like this one http://www.specialtybottle.com/58dramclearshortieglassvialwblkcap.aspx<br />and tare its weight then scoop your RC into it...this way you get a stable reading...

				Haha, that&#039;s probably the most popular scale owned by the present-day recreational drug user, and for good reason.It&#039;s a good scale for the price, and it&#039;ll give you relatively accurate readings for anything above 10-15mg. I&#039;ve never noticed any stickiness on the plate either.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d trust it for &gt;5mg amounts. Nothing in the $20-$200 range of scales is going to give you that amount of accuracy though, so caution is advised.

Since I am doing volumetric dosing it will be a lot higher amounts (i.e. 50mg, 75,&nbsp; 100mg etc etc) I just want to make sure it is a smart move to purchase it. Glad to see the positive reviews already flowing in from the &quot;right&quot; people. ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks much for the feedback.&nbsp; I now know what I need, and @Gestaassault that specialty bottle website is awesome! It&#039;s got everything I need!

				At OP, I love this scale and I got it about 3 weeks ago. The plate that it comes with it, like everyone says, doesn&#039;t have a fit/snug position, so you can get varied weights if not using it properly. The weight varies by adding about 3 or 4 mg&#039;s to what you are weighing, if the plate is not in the proper position. If you have the scale in front of you at eye level, you can balance the tray straight for the most part, but there is no locking position that it sits in, so it is easy to bump the tray slightly, giving you a different weight. <br />I got the scale to read the 10 gram calibration weight as 10.000 grams, 5 out of&nbsp; ten times doing a weight testing. Before each time I did not change the position of the tray, which more than likely has to do with the varied weights. The other five readings were 9.999, 10.002, 10.001, 10.003, 10.001. <br /><br />I then did another separate test using the given tray,&nbsp; and weighed the 10gram calibration weight 10 separate times again. Each time, before and after each weigh, I made sure the plate was straight ( according to my eyes.) Note the differences in weight are not as much.<br />My readings were 10.000, 9.999, 9.998, 9.999,9.999,10.000, 10.000, 10.000, 9.998, 9.999 grams. I would rate it a 10 out of 10 simply for the price and ease of use. *Before ingesting anything I was sure to use the calibration weight numerous times on both trips.* <br /><br />I have used it successfully to weigh out 36 mgs of 2C-E that I ingested recently. (Weighed out 18mgs two times, so you can say the dose was between 36-42 mgs.) <br />I also used it to weigh out 26 mg of 2C-E 2 weeks prior to that trip. I now use the small glass vial method suggested above to weigh my stuff and noticed only a 1 or 2mg difference, so it does work slightly better and is more convenient than the tray. <br />The tiny glass jar I have fits perfectly where the tray is supposed to go, and empty weighed 2.849 or 2.850 grams each time I weighed it. This was done 15 times. I think this is very reliable for the money, but wouldn&#039;t buy it if the substances you need to weigh have a very steep response curve.&nbsp; <br /><br />* I am fully aware that 2C-E&#039;s response curve is considered steep.

				like everyone said, the dish is no good, but by using a dime between the plate and the dish you can make it work a lot better (trust me it makes sense when you see it).&nbsp; <br />Accuracy is about what everyone else has said.&nbsp; If I recall it&#039;s +/- 5mg<br />i have a lot of issues with substances sticking.&nbsp; If I&#039;m weighing out lots of bags, then I just let it get covered and then don&#039;t worry about it, if I&#039;m weighting doses I&#039;ll use a small square of toilet paper and then just wrap said chemical and swallow whole.
