				So I&#039;m getting dragged to a cocktail party this weekend. (bleargh). Not my thing at all, black tie, stiff upper lip and all that bollocks.&nbsp; <br /><br />SO, I plan to be discreetly off my face on MDMA to make the whole drama a bit more groovy.<br /><br />But can I drink, on MDMA?<br />I mean, I&#039;ve always *assumed* that it&#039;s not a good idea, although I have no memory as to where that notion may have come from. (´･_･`)? <br /><br />What are people&#039;s experiences with alcohol and MDMA?<br />Oh, and I&#039;m not talking just a couple of beers, I&#039;m talking about mixed spirit cocktails.<br /><br />Some candid advice would be much appreciated.

				I have almost always drank spirits while on MDMA, never really had an issue in terms of dehydration as I&#039;ve always had water to sip on also.<br /><br />Supposedly not supposed to have more than a few? (everyones &quot;few&quot; is a different amount)<br /><br />I seem to roll harder if I drink. It helps when I come down after 12 hours of rolling.<br /><br />Water is key!

				If you start drinking first, the MDMA roll will be less intense and taper off quicker. <br /><br />If you take the MDMA first you will roll harder and the alcohol will seem to be ineffective, and you can accidentally drink more than you should. Either way, drinking alcohol with MDMA is wasteful and pointless. <br /><br />Drink water regularly, and don&#039;t overheat. Get some air and also remember not to confess your soul to some stranger just because you&#039;ve got MDMA trust and confidence booster :) <br /><br />Stay safe, <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.

				DrugBuddy covered the most important part of this, you can definitely drink more than you should ever be able to so be very careful if you choose to consume alcohol during your roll. You may become dehydrated a lot faster, forget what is going on at times, and wake up the next morning with some memory loss.

				why ruin a good roll with alcohol? also, if you want effects similar to mdma + alcohol, why not just take ghb instead? just my opinion... but i don&#039;t particularly care for alcohol. it&#039;s safe as long as you don&#039;t overdo it.

				Well, I am not a huge drinker myself. I always figured that booze would just cloud my roll (granted mdma is my DOC).. I have however had many friends and customers complain about how mixing the two destroyed the point of both, leaving one with a somewhat delerious muddy experience overall.. on the other hand I&#039;ve noticed that people who don&#039;t process alcohol well (i.e Native Americans, Asians) tend to swear by the mix. I myself attribute this to their love of alcohol more then the merit of the combination.<br />I would just roll and drink lots of virgin drinks to keep up appearance&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ve never rolled while not drinking tbh, but I always feel drinking can kick it back in if the mdma&#039;s tapering off..<br /><br />Sounds like a hilarious idea though.&nbsp; They&#039;ll know you&#039;re on something btw!

				One time I rolled, I met a friend who gave me a juice glass full of tequila. I started drinking uncontrollably because it tasted like water to me because of MDMA (normally I never drink tequila, because I can&#039;t stand the taste). Then someone bought me some Jäger, whiskey cola ect. I blacked out. I mean I didn&#039;t pass out, but I can&#039;t remember most of the night, just moments here and then. I don&#039;t recommend heavy drinking but one beer or two couldn&#039;t do harm. :)

				Well I went. Was off my face on mdma. (I can hide it well), I had two cocktails between about 5pm and 8pm.<br />Didn&#039;t make a toss of a difference. To the mdma roll I mean.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t really like alcohol very much. But I certainly didn&#039;t notice much of an interaction, if any. <br /><br />In short, I didn&#039;t get rat-arsed, I stayed high.&nbsp; Dunno what I was worried about tbh.&nbsp; lol

				There is no specific bad interaction but their negative side effects add up. Dehydration, increased cardiovascular load, emotional lability etc.
