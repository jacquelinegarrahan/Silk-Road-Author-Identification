				Has anyone had much experience with mixing cocaine and MDMA together.<br /><br />Ive got a few mates who say its the best thing, but others who say that coke is too powerful and it wipes off the ping from the mdma, and you dont feel the mdma.<br /><br />I used to coke for pre drinks, then mdma when im out or at a festival. But lately ive found that whenever i have coke for pres, the mdma/pills have no effect on me for majority of the day.<br /><br />Also tend to find coke makes me quite anxious and paranoid after it wears off? (Could this be just bad quality coke cut with bad things?)

				Coke just cuts off the MDMA. Anxiety and jitters are usually down to cutting agents however if you do enough coke you will start to get shaky.

				When i was like 17 me an some friends went to a festival, we got some fucking amazing MDMA crystals off our friends that we met down there, then found a couple grams of (shitty) coke off some random dudes. <br /><br />One of the nights we were doing coke n molly all night, it was hella fun, but we wouldve been better off not buying the coke. It was cool cus we were all speedy and running around meeting people, but there was only a real faintness of empathy and the &#039;magic&#039; from MDMA. <br /><br />

				This is not a combo you should be doing, here why....<br /><br />When you do MDMA, it makes your brain release lots of Serotonin (5-HT), which is what makes the magic of MDMA.&nbsp; MDMA also releases Dopamine.&nbsp; After rolling for 5+ hours your brains runs out of 5-HT, which is why taking more MDMA at that point gives you more of a speedy effect and less empathy and euphoria&nbsp; (the MDMA is cauing your brain to release mostly dopamine at that point, your out of 5-HT).&nbsp; <br /><br />Problem is, brain damage occurs when Dopamine is taken into 5-HT (serotonin) reuptake transporter.&nbsp; This makes h2o2 (or peroxide) in your brain. Needless to say not a good thing, as this instantly kills brain cells.&nbsp; Now, you may be wondering, what does this have to do with coke?&nbsp; Well, coke releases mad amounts of dopamine, which is going to expodentially increase the odds that dopamine is going to get taken into a 5-HT reuptake transporter and make peroxide, causing brain damage.<br /><br />Moral of the story, if you MUST do coke with MDMA, do your coke in the first few hours, and then DON&#039;T TOUCH IT.&nbsp; Way Easier said then done, and I wouldn&#039;t put myself in that situation, because I can turn into a feind when coming off MDMA.&nbsp;

				Cocaine is also a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. If you use it before MDMA, the serotonin release properties of MDMA will be blocked.

				Agreed, Be Careful! Serotonin Syndrome and other risks. If you do, have a friend nearby to at least confess your sins and thoughts, that&#039;s what happened to me when I did DXM and MDMA at the same time, I was so convinced it&#039;d be my last night on earth because I read about Serotonin Syndrome and spent the whole night being a buzz kill talking about personal feelings until I woke up the next morning feeling like a loser although the potential psuedo near death experience I was making up in my head convinced me my friendship strengthened. In the end though, you&#039;re free to make your own choices and you&#039;ll have hell of a story to tell but those will come naturally with life especially in our outfit, so don&#039;t do it for the cred your ego&#039;s making in the head! Lol.
