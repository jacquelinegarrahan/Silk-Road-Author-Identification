				I&#039;m looking for a liver-safe steroid alternative. I don&#039;t want to look like hulk hogan, I just need a little extra testosterone/ workout boost. I&#039;ve started using creatine and whey and these things have helped slightly. Any advice?

				The right way to take anabolics is to inject them. Orals don&#039;t do much on their own. You shouldn&#039;t waste your first cycle on them anyway. Something tells me the last thing you need is steroids though.

				Just do deca.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t boost testosterone though.&nbsp; Nor does it give you a workout boost.&nbsp; But it helps you put on muscle faster.<br /><br />If you want a workout boost, try caffeine + aspirin.&nbsp; Or NO-Xplode or SuperPump250.

				Diet and exercise.&nbsp; <br />Really that&#039;s what it comes down to, if you want the results steroids bring, you have to use steroids.&nbsp; You can do a lot by keeping your diet and exercise regimen in check, it just takes time to see results.&nbsp; <br />

				Better.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got all the good candy.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But in all seriousness, protein and creatine should do you fine.&nbsp; Bongobingo mentioned caffeine and aspirin, which could be beneficial as well.&nbsp; If you&#039;re determined to get more supplements try looking at bodybuilding.com.&nbsp; Lots of good info and they have reviews on the products they offer.

				You got your answer already. You need to inject steroids to keep your liver safe. They will still fuck your natural hormone production up but who needs the ability to get an erection.<br /><br />Perhaps you could go with a lighter steroid such as Oxandrolone.

				You could look for a supplement company &quot;Primordial performance&quot;, their pro hormone series looks promising when health factor is taken in to account.<br /><br />Never tried their pro hormone range, but heard positive reviews and it&#039;s also a pretty quality oriented company judging from some of their products I&#039;ve taken.<br />Like steroids PCT and research needs to planned.<br /><br />And no you can&#039;t look like Hulk Hogan by accident!

Steroids are not used as a shortcut.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve seriously trained, and I mean properly trained, for something like 6, 8, or even 10 years, only then should you consider steroids so that you can exceed your genetic potential.<br /><br />Right now, as someone new to training, there is absolutely no need to use steroids.<br /><br />If you train properly as a beginner, you can experience amazing results in your first year of training.<br /><br />Most of the strength gains you will ever have in your life are experienced in your first year of proper training. There is no need to use steroids at this stage. It&#039;s beyond foolish.<br /><br />What is proper training? If you&#039;re not squatting and deadlifting, you&#039;re not training properly.<br /><br />If you&#039;re serious about making a change in your life, about gaining serious strength, there is only one book you need:<br /><br />&#039;Starting Strength&#039; by Mark Rippetoe. <br /><br />Read that and take it like your bible. You will dramatically change your life.
