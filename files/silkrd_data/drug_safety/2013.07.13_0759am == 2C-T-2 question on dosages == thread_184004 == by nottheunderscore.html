				So, I&#039;m just curious if anyone out there has tried Morpheu5&#039;s 2ct2 and if so what dosage do they recommend.&nbsp; <br /><br />Me and my girl are gonna take tomorrow and i&#039;m curious on dosages.&nbsp; Erowid dosages have always been a little misleading for me, especially with the 2c family.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is Morpheu5&#039;s stuff so pure that the erowid dosages are actually relevant?&nbsp; <br />

				A couple years back I happened upon 2c-t-2 and remember it being quite amazing and quite special.&nbsp; Somehow more special than 2ci, 2ce, 2cb, and 2ct7.&nbsp; I recently ordered from Morpheu5 and had quite the pleasure of receiving and trying his product.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I dosed my friends and myself based off the dosages I had of 2ct2 a couple years ago, and wow this stuff was way stronger.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our dosages were as follows:&nbsp; *Names have been changed<br /><br />40mg - Myself aka Mitch (Male 180lbs) <br /><br />24mg - Chassidy&nbsp; &nbsp;120 lbs<br /><br />26mg - Christina - 135 lbs <br /><br />35mg - Frank - 170 lbs <br /><br /><br />We took this stuff at a club…with the knowledge that if it were to be too intense we could always just cab-home.&nbsp; Wow…it was way intense.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 2ct2 really kicked back in our roll…we had all taken some Molly about 2.5 hours before and the 2c-t-2 made it feel like it was back full force.&nbsp; About a hour after we all took the 2ct2 we realized we needed to go home.&nbsp; <br /><br />The trip was super intense for me as I had taken 40mg, and it was definitely a little uncomfortable at the beginning.&nbsp; No one ever experienced any intense nasea or body-load but Cassidy threw-up once bc she was extremely new into the tripping scene.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.5 hours after we had dropped it, everyone was having a good time, but for most of our crew…the first little bit was a really wild ride.&nbsp; Being in a club was not a good idea.<br /><br />Our bodis all felt amazing and we all definitely took advantage of the heightened sexual energy we all had.&nbsp; As for the visuals…It seemed like someone was holding sparklers in our eyes.&nbsp; Everything we looked at kind of was just exploding with little sparks and of course the colors were very pronounced.&nbsp; After the first 2 hours, the sparkling wore off, and the traditional &quot;breathing&quot; rooms and swirling tiles of the 2c Family visuals were happening.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember looking through my drawer of clothes thinking &quot;Who&#039;s Clothes are these?&quot;&nbsp; The all looked so foreign to me and the colors of all my clothes had completely changed.&nbsp; I kept thinking &quot;wow, this is so much more intense than last time.&quot;&nbsp; (Last time I dosed 2ct2 years ago it was around 32-35mg)&nbsp; <br /><br />We took at 1am and by 7am we were all still feeling pretty good.&nbsp; 3 of us all opted to take a little more around sunrise and we all took 6, 12, and 13mg boosters.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really feel too much more by taking the 13mg booster but i&#039;m sure it prolonged the trip for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Summary:&nbsp; I would likely take the 40mg again, but I wouldn&#039;t go any higher than that.&nbsp; My vision was seriously altered at this level and it stayed very altered for at least a couple hours.&nbsp; Once the trip settled in everyone was having a lot of fun and dancing and joking and laughing…it was a very amazing experience and hopefully someone can now base their dosage and their experience based off the notes I have given.&nbsp; <br /><br />My personal recommendation:&nbsp; Watch the sunrise, Paint, Swim, play winamp&#039;s Milkdrop visualizer and shower in absolute darkness, ABSOLUTE DARKNESS (No door-cracks with light coming in or else you&#039;ll rob yourself of the experience of completely losing &quot;where&quot; you are.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />For a more in depth list of things to do..check out this List of things to do while Tripping thread here:&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=80623.msg958583#msg958583
