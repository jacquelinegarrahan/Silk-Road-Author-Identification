				Hey people! i need some help regarding first use in DMT and i will be happy if you share anything from your knowledge and experience on this subject :)! <br />So first i heard the best way to smoke DMT is through something called &#039; The machine &#039; but unfortunately the only thing i have here is a bong. <br />i heard the chemical it self is very sensitive to fire and people even use special tobacco/datura but i only have normal ciggies with me<br />i rad on some threads that its most advised to take 0.05 a hit but than again i don&#039;t even have the right scale right know. just the knowledge of the amount i have in total (0.2 yellow/white) is their any trick in the book to split the amount without any scales &quot;? <br /><br />I also heard a lot about &#039;setting the mood&#039; before you take the hit and do a little bit Feng shui , meditation , music and so on.. <br /><br /><br />please share your wisdom&nbsp; :D

				Put some EDIT: ash - NOT hash, LOL (a thick layer) below and above the DMT, as a sandwich (it is called the sandwich method in fact ;) ). Just don&#039;t put the flame too much in contact with the top layer of ash and you will be fine.<br /><br />As for making up doses, you have 0.2g right? Then you need only to divide it in 4 parts and everyone of them will be 0.05g. However I will start with dividing one of those in half and trying that to be sure you don&#039;t waste a full 0.05 in case you burn the DMT; if all goes well you don&#039;t need to go full breakthrough on the first try (btw it&#039;s difficult with a bong but if you are lucky and you vaporize the DMT correctly 25mg are more than enough to have a breakthrough).

				Hey thanks for replying !<br /><br />i divided like you said and i think i got something between 20-30 for sure. i didn&#039;t have any hash so i just compressed tobacco real good on the bottom of the bowel added the dmt and tobacco on top of it, everything is ready !!! wish me luck&nbsp; 8) :D :) ;)

				Good luck!<br /><br />Herbs (as tobacco) works fine but ash (not hash! damn, I wrote it badly) is better, because it shields heat better and because it doesn&#039;t interfere with the effect of DMT (but some prefer to use herbs because it changes the taste, but if you have a bong you should be fine) in any way. Just have some cigarettes to burn alone and recover the ash in the ashtray and you are good to go. But you can also use tobacco (or other neutral herbs as oregano, mint, mullein etc. etc.)<br /><br />LOL, didn&#039;t notice I wrote &quot;hash&quot; instead of &quot;ash&quot;, and I even re-read the post; I guess it&#039;s a freudian lapsus that tells me I want some hash ;)<br /><br />Sorry for the mistake.

				Also, try to light it from as far away from possible and suck very gently at the beginning to get it lit, once it is take the flame away, you might need to take a few hits because it can be quiet harsh. Try inhale for 10 seconds or so. You might want to find something less harsh then tobacco to use as that can make it a bit harder to pull.<br /><br />Good luck, buddy.

				Smoking DMT is a skill.<br /><br />You&#039;ve basically two options.<br /><br />Ease yourself in - work up to your doseage<br /><br />Go balls out - drop enough for&nbsp; breakthrough the first time you try it.<br /><br />Easing in<br /><br />If you want to ease in. Start with small doses, 10 mg say. A small bong is ideal, lay dried herbs such as mint or mullein ,or ever weed ash. Place the measured DMT on top. Stay with the flame well away from the bowl. And then bring in closer as you draw in breath. You should aim to be reaching 2/3 maximum draw just as the DMT starts to melt. The white vapor appears, and at this point don&#039;t take the flame closer.<br /><br />Just vary the power of your breath to take the flame into the bowl. If you want to melt more draw harder, less melt, let off a little.<br /><br />Once you have filled your lungs stop and hold your breath. Most people make the mistake of holding their breath right from the start. This is a mistake. your lungs are not yet full. You have just reached then of your diaphragm contraction.&nbsp; Relax your diaphragm, and then take another breath. You can do this without letting much air out of your lungs.<br /><br />This allows you to take in more oxygenated air, and hold your breath for longer.<br /><br />Hold for a good 15 secs release slowly and take another hit, using the same technique.<br /><br />Half way through the second git, the world will get fucked up. Finish the second hit, go for the third,but close your eyes. Make sure you have planned somewhere safe to drop your bong/smoking device. Doing this way and working on your smoking technique. Means you fine the exact dose you breakthrough at with good smoking technique. Probably around the 30 mg mark with a good set up.<br /><br />Going balls out<br /><br />You will need to go a few mg over a breakthrough dose, say 50mg. This is because your smoking technique will be rubbish. No matter how good you&#039;ll think you will be. You&#039;ll most likely burn the DMT first time around. Then it will taste like shit. And you&#039;ll need to get and keep a good lung full to ensure breakthrough. Try to use the above technique, but getting a breakthrough first time around is more about shoving 50 mg into a bowl and drawing as much in one go and holding it for as longer as you can.<br /><br />What ever way you do breakthrough. The next trip after that, man that&#039;s the fucking scary one, because you know what the shit can do.<br /><br />

The same thing holds true for a milligram scale. They&#039;re cheap as fuck on Amazon and eBay (~$20 for the cheapest ones) and are totally worth the investment.<br />If you don&#039;t have a scale available and you&#039;re 100% sure you&#039;ve got exactly .2 grams, you can just eyeball it into four equal parts and they&#039;ll be ~50mg each.<br />Meditation is always a good idea, even when not taking drugs :)

				I tried the machine to no avail (first time using it), but it was just so much more convenient for a regular bong rip. <br /><br />This is very similar to the above mentioned methods.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how I did it with a standard bong rip (NEVER TOUCH THE FLAME TO THE WEED):<br /><br />1. Take bowl, put a pinch of weed on bottom. This is just so the DMT doesn&#039;t completely get sucked into the water<br /><br />2. Put DMT on top<br /><br />3. Put another layer of weed on top. This is the protective layer<br /><br />4. When hitting, you want the EDGE of the flame to just FLOAT over the top layer, trust me, even if you don&#039;t see the weed cherry, it&#039;s vaporizing the DMT. <br /><br />Chances are though, you&#039;ll be like me and some of the flame with ignite the weed on top, but that&#039;s ok, it&#039;s there to protect the DMT for as long as possible. Immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY, put the edge of the flame over the weed again if you accidentally cherry the top layer. Just make sure YOU NEVER LET THE FLAME GO THROUGH, and KEEP IT FLOATING for as long as you can. The DMT is very sensitive and will vaporize easily with just heat floating over it<br /><br />You&#039;ll notice a very plastic-like taste coming up. Do this for 5 seconds, and if you really want to be ballsy for your first trip, hit the weed completely. <br /><br />I had a friend help me light mine the first time, cause when you blast off, YOU BLAST THE FUCK OFF LOL

				Hey guys thanks everyone for replying!&nbsp; this information have turned out to be very useful for me!<br />My first toke on DMT was absolutely superb, It took me one single rip to draw all the smoke and i didn&#039;t felt the taste at all (maybe cause i used ice in my bong) i held it as long as i could in my longs and when i released i instantly saw the effects,&nbsp; i saw this huge wave of green color like ive never seen something so green in my entire life! when i closed my eyes i saw many patterns and spinning orbs and i felt like this fun tingling feeling all over my body after i opened my eyes again it was like really intense LSD trip i could definitely see sound coming out of my speakers and everything was just shaping around :) it lasted about 7/8 minutes in total , I&#039;m pretty sure i didn&#039;t breakthrough or anything but it was my first time so i guess it&#039;s perfectly fine , Quite positive experience i must say.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D
