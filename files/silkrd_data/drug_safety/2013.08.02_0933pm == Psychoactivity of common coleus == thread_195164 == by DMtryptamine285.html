				Coleus Blumei and Coleus Pumilus are two gorgeous, intense-colored kinds of Coleus that can be commonly found in gardens and in nurseries around the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Mazatecs use this plant and Salvia Divinorum in a similar way and believe that they belong to the same plant family: Salvia is the female, the Coleus pumilus is the male and the Coleus Blumei is &quot;el nene&quot; or &quot;el ahijado&quot; (the godson).<br /><br /><br /><br />Although no psychoactive substance has been found in the Coleus plant, many people report feeling a glowy, dreamy, bright effect when ingesting a high amount of Coleus leaves.<br /><br />It takes about fifty to severnty large, colorful leaves of the coleus<br /><br />plant to get someone going. They can be chewed thoroughly and swallowed.<br /><br />If one prefers, the leaves can also be smoked and steeped in lukewarm water for<br /><br />for about an hour, after which the liquid is strained and drunk.<br /><br /><br /><br />No one is exactly sure what gives coleus its psychoactive kick, but we do<br /><br />know that only fresh leaves will work. Dried leaves have virtually no<br /><br />effect.<br /><br /><br /><br />For centuries, the Mazatec Indians of southwestern Mexico have known and used El Ahijado in their religious healing ceremonies. In traditional Mazatec communities, Coleus Blumei is considered ‘the male’ (El Ahijado) and Salvia Divinorum is considered ‘the female’ (La Hembra). However, the shamen and healers tend to use Coleus Blumei only when they are unable to procure Salvia Divinorum.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Mazatec natives tend to consume El Ahijado in two way, either as a fresh lea chewable quid or as a dried leaf smokable herb. Traditionally, eight to twelve small leaves are freshly picked from the plant, rolled into a quid and chewed, the juices are swallowed and after 15 – 20 minutes the used quid is discarded and exchanged for fresh leaves. In other Mazatec communities the leaves and flowers are gathers and dried, the resulting dried herbs are crushed and mixed with tobacco or Tagetes lucida (Mexican Tarragon) to be smoked.<br /><br />Many people report that small doses of El Ahijado are very similar to small doses of Salvia Divinorum, this is certainly a powerful Shamanic traveling plant and needs to be studied more carefully. Similar to many other plants like Salvia Divinorum and Cannabis Sativa, the effects of Coleus Blumei are not usually felt after the first trial, rather it take several attempts and knowledge of the plant to fully feel its inebriating effects. However, there is still much debate as to the efficacy and potentiality of Coleus Blumei, there are many reports from reputable ethnobotanists and ethnopharmacologists suggesting that they have experienced little to no effects with this plant… as is often the case, the journey is always viewed through the eye of previous experience.
