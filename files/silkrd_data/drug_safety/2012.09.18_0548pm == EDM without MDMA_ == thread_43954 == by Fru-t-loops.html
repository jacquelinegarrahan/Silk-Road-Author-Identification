				I&#039;ve been taking a lot of MDMA and want to build up a tolerance again.

				25g is a great psychedelic for enjoying music and being around people. It&#039;s physically stimulating, enhances sound, gives you a nice mood lift, some body euphoria, butdoesn&#039;t mess with your head --doesn&#039;t even come with any visuals. <br /><br />If you want visuals, you can go for 25c ... it&#039;s most in tune with music which actually affects the visuals which I find a lot of fun. And it comes with an energy, not exactly stimulating like caffeine ... more like taking a protein shake or creatine. Stick with a moderate dose though, else you&#039;ll get a punch-drunk kind of high which I don&#039;t find a lot of fun.

				25g is the most clearheaded followed by 25i. You&#039;ll have a good time on both, just don&#039;t overdo the 25i. 800ug is plenty, especially if you plan to smoke weed.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really sure you can overdo 25g, that one is really friendly.

				Cocaine or ketamine+MDMA. Don&#039;t do cocaine and MDMA though. Or swallow about 1 part crystal meth and 4 parts MDMA and you will go nuts!! I don&#039;t ever do meth unless its a tiny bit with MDMA. It really increases the stimmy parts but doesnt leave you too cracked out afterwards and you can sleep and eat later on<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				25i-nbome is actually really fun if you keep the dose low 500-800mics, it is pretty subtle and from my experience you can&#039;t have a bad trip on it. Things aren&#039;t as awesome, lovey, or at their best like when you are on MDMA but it keeps you up, going, and having fun. Sometimes festivals and concerts are fun without drugs but this is the road so I doubt that will ever happen for most of us. Just bring a little melatonin or bud if you are having trouble sleeping afterwards.

				2c-b, 6-apb, perhaps acid, i find its a little less flooring and more acrive than shrooms<br /><br />cocaine, ampetamines, and even crystal meth are also pretty fun, you might get a little technical in your enjoyment though

				^6-apb is cross-tolerant with MDMA, so no.<br /><br />I would go for 2c-b. It should be quite gentle as far as headspace goes but you&#039;ll still get nice euphoria and visuals.<br /><br />Lower doses of 25b, 25c, and 25i would be interesting as well if you&#039;re not used to tripping.

				I would say it&#039;s common but it definitely doesn&#039;t happen to everyone. Sometimes I just dry heave for a little bit and spit something small out. For some reason that little something was the killer, and I feel fine afterwards. I don&#039;t puke or feel nauseous with methylone. Make sure your stomach isn&#039;t full and I have better success when I have a vegan/vegetarian diet the day that I roll.

				MDMA is very acidic and people often roll on an empty stomach. To help prevent nausea/vomiting, have some tums about 30-60 minutes before rolling.

Chucking up straightens you out but I&#039;m not sure why this actually is, maybe it&#039;s the shock from the physical action of it. Who knows.

				Thanks for the advice guys. I wanted to try the 25g-nbome but the seller has left my order processing for 5 days. <br /><br />To me, EDM =/= Rave since a rave refers to the scene/experience where EDM refers to the music. Not all EDM festivals are a rave like dayglow or maybe Ultra. As someone pointed out, some have camping options, or other activities on the side, etc. <br /><br />As far as nausea, I&#039;ve only had this once, which was when I snorted 140mg at a loud event. Aside from that I&#039;ve rolled 10 or so times without nausea. Just don&#039;t do all .120+ at once. I&#039;ve seen people snort 75, wait 20, then 75mg more, or swallow half and snort the rest, etc. On .1 total I never had any nausea but I wasn&#039;t quite drowning in serotonin as if I took a defqon. Just don&#039;t get it all at once and you should be better off.
