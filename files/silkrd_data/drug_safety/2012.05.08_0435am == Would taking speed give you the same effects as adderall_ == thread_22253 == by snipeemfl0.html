				Because adderall in pill form is so damn expensive now, I was wondering if there is any difference between adderall and speed? I read adderall is time release, so I guess a lower dose of speed would give you a same peak energy as adderall?<br /><br />Would the speed be good for studying/working?<br /><br />What would a good dosage be?<br /><br />And lastly, are you able to control yourself 100%? Would I be able to go into public or talk to friends without being impaired. Obliviously I would feel energetic and &quot;speedy&quot;, but would I still be able to think 100%?

				Adderall is an amphetamine derivative very similar but not identical to pure amphetamine. Now I&#039;ve never done amphetamine but I would imagine the effects are extremely similar with adderall only being slightly more mild. If you are planning on taking amphetamine for doing work just watch your dose and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be able to control yourself completely.<br /><br />Also i&#039;m pretty sure Adderall is only time release on certain pills such as XR. Normal Adderall effects are felt quickly.

				I grew up on dextroamphetamine prescriptions , and have done lots of ritalin and adderall as well. <br /><br />Base Amphetamine or cut speed is very similar indeed. I sped my way through university degrees, much like students do with dex/meth blends. <br /><br />If I had the choice of quality base amphetamine powder/paste I would take it any day over adderall. Sure, pharmaceuticals are higher quality, but if the price is high...<br /><br />I also laughed when I looked at the price of ADHD medications on SR. Surely artificially inflated by people recognizing the drug brand names and not knowing suitable alternatives. Either that or lesser penalties for trafficking or possession?<br /><br />

				I&nbsp; bought some poor quality speed deliberately (cut with caffeine). It has very good effects on work productivity and it&#039;s dirt cheap. I reckon that cut stuff (with either caffeine or modafinil) would probably be better than pure speed in productivity. Try taking it orally I think (i always dissolved in coffee) as this will make the metabolism slower than snorting (better for working as less hyperactive). The key thing to remember though is that amphetamine makes you good at doing one thing at once due to increasing blood flow to the part of the brain you are using at the cost of other areas (caffeine actually increases it to all regions - not entirely sure what the combination does scientifically but can tell you it&#039;s workable). Make sure you cut off distractions as a result of this - perhaps even as much as not having music on (i found this helped on speed). I used this for a string of university essay submissions to very good effect academically and in the amount of time i had to spend.<br /><br />Warning though: It&#039;s fucking horrible if you use it a lot and start getting withdrawal.

The prices for ADD med&#039;s is fucking ridiculous but at least you know what you are getting via pill identification. Adderall def will help with focus/studies but start small...like 10 mg. and go from there. If you find it helps (and you have medical coverage) I encourage you to seek out a psychiatrist to get treatment for your ADD (wink wink).<br /><br />I would strongly discourage you from buying any of the so-called &#039;Speed&#039; available here: most samples which have been analyzed indicate cuts of up to 90% caffeine. As long as ppl keep buying the shit which passes for &#039;amphetamine sulphate&#039; the vendors will gladly continue to sell that shit. Might as well stick with coffee.<br /><br />&quot;Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin Franklin
