				I don&#039;t recommend snorting any of the RCs, I snorted 2C-B last week and it hurt soooo bad, I suggest the rectal method but be careful you don&#039;t OD, try half a dose until you are used to the effect.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				I have had some of DRamsterdam&#039;s 2C-B last weekend and am surprised how bad I seem to react on oral administration.<br /><br />Measured some 25mg, put it in a gelcap, and swallowed it on a nearly empty stomach. Two hours later I was like on MDMA, in a very good mood, but not more, especially no visuals at all. Then I decided to insufflate another 10mg, and shit was cash. 30 seconds after the snort I was in another dimension, and it lasted at least 3.5 hours.

				2c-b is a killer to snort. But now when I take 2c-b it&#039;s always when I&#039;m rolling on MDMA, I find the pain to be far less intense. I&#039;ve never taken it orally, I like the faster onset and the more intense trip... But that&#039;s just me. I never really measure my doses for 2c-b, just a little bump does me fine. I&#039;d say its no more than 15-20mg. Remember, you can always take more... but you can&#039;t take back what you&#039;ve already taken... start of slow.

				Why do people consider 2C-B as a research chemical? It&#039;s been in human consumption as long as MDMA and it&#039;s been available as a pharmaceutical product and a smart shop pill thingy. What exactly is the definition of a RC?

				Not exactly sure, happy for anyone to correct me, but I think it gets down to the fact that there are heaps of 2C-?s and each can be tweaked to make it slightly different... Although I don&#039;t think2C-B has been around for quite as long as MDMA, again not sure, but I think MDMA was invented in the early 19&#039;s and didn&#039;t get researched much til Shulgin got hold of the patent, then after playing with it for a while he develloped synthetic analogues of it, like 2C-B.<br /><br />Can someone validate me please?
