				I&#039;ve had a dexedrine script for a year or so now and take 20-30mg a day during the week. I take it because it makes the work I do that much more awesome.<br /><br />For the last couple months I&#039;ve been tripping on one of the weekend days about every week. 2C-B, 2C-I, MDMA, M1, and various tryptamines. I try to give myself at least 2 weeks between the use MDMA/M1-like materials. I almost always have great experiences.<br /><br />I take plenty of daily supplements: tyrosine, 5-htp, chleated Mg, fish oil etc<br />I don&#039;t drink alcohol much at all and smoke like 1/2g of weed a week.<br />I&#039;m in pretty good physical and mental condition.<br /><br />My question is:<br />What effect can one expect my daily amphetamine use to have on my psychedelic experiences?<br /><br />Does daily Dex use caise the body to become more efficient in phenethylamine metabolisis, requiring larger doses of psychedelic phenethylamines? Would switching to methylphenidate help anything?<br /><br />Will the physical/psychological tolerance I may have developed to Dexedrine affect the intensity of psychedelic experiences.<br /><br />Is this habit particularly bad for me?<br /><br />Id love to hear any general advice and from anyone who has/had a similar regimen.<br /><br />I&#039;ve considered experimenting w/ 5mg&nbsp; Dex doses to my pychedelic experiences to maybe offset the tolerance I would have but I don&#039;t want to go down a shitty path and I also am not that convinced my experiences are really less intense than those of others at the same dose.<br /><br />If there were any good info saying this is harmful to me I would seriously curb my Dex use. This isn&#039;t really something they do research studies on :)<br /><br />Thanks and happy travels,<br /><br />whirlwind<br />

				classical psychedelic experiences are mainly dependent upon 5-HT2a agonism, sometimes 2c but any dex tolerance shouldnt really have an effect. the dopaminergic component may be slightly attenuated, specifically the speediness associated feelings. if you are tripping every week that is going to build up your tolerance eventually more so than the dex. i dont really see the point of taking speed in addition to a psychedelic unless you just like to tweak and hallucinate, if anything your dex tolerance would make tripping more enjoyable to me, but i dont really like being all on edge and would like to relax more while using lsd and mescaline<br /><br />not sure if you would be metabolizing phenethylamines faster, are the drugs not lasting the normal expected duration or are you having to use unusually high doses or something? not necessarily seeing your concern for the dex diminishing your trip or why you would think that in the first place i guess.<br /><br />now if you take ritalin or coke and dont get the full expected experience i would probably say that is due to your dopaminergic changes from dex use

				I prefer a week or two of amphetamine abstinence before using psychedelics or mdxx, in order to give my body time to recover. The reason is that in the days after amphetamine I feel like &quot;psychedelically exhausted&quot;, and I need some time to regain that very deep access to myself that psychedelics address to. There is to say that I use amphetamine for fun, and not medically. So I cant really say if it&#039;s the same as if you take it daily as a medicine.<br /><br />A few thoughts on serotonin, which plays the essential role in the mechanism of psychedelics:<br />Although amphetamine does not significantly release serotonin, it induces stress by its effects on the autonomic nervous system, and it&#039;s proven that stress decreases the serotonin production. Again, I can&#039;t say for sure if this applies to a medical use of amphetamine.<br /><br />I had two important experiences with amphetamine and psychedelics:<br /><br />1. mixed acid and amphetamine. very nice trip, but after the come-down, this typical harmony with myself and the world (that I usually got after LSD) was missing. This showed me that amphetamine somehow blocks the access to a deeper area in the mind.<br /><br />2. took acid the day after a three day amphetamine binge. worst experience ever (but also due to some other reasons...)!!!<br /><br />Just keep in mind that these are my opinions/experiences, and it may be different for you. I don&#039;t want to scare you off... =)

				Excellent responses, thanks guys.<br />Going a day without dex actually feels good to me provided i dont have anything to do but lay around. None of that mental exhaustion I would get in my high school days after popping a friends 30XR.<br />I was also thinking that dopamine receptor downregulation (if any) *could* provide for a more peaceful trip (less stress). I really don&#039;t know the role it plays. I bet dopamine is a more important part of a @C experience than a tryptamine experience. Could we agree that a dopamine rush plays an important part in the &#039;rolling balls&#039; feeling one gets with MDMA? I havent taken over 150mg for years, but also have not been rolling balls either. im not a huge dude by any means.<br /><br /><br />Like I said, I love my 5-HTP and i do notice if i stop taking it for a few days. Hopefully my serotonin production is where it should be.<br />I believe that tryptamines mimic serotonin, so a deficit wouldnt affect much there. I am pretty sure phens release serotonin (deficit would have an effect here) but am not sure if they also mimic it. something special has to tickle that 5HT2A receptor to give us those crazy visuals and thoughts right?<br /><br />Maybe MDMA only releases neurotransmitters and has no direct action on receptor sites which is why normal thought patterns exist and only mild visuals can be seen.<br /><br />I really cant say with any certainty that I require more chemicals than my friends to get the same effects. <br /><br />Anyone used 4-AcO-DMT &#039;Psilacetin&#039;? I tried it last weekend exceeding Erowids &#039;strong&#039; dose and taking 22mg. Id say this felt like only 2-2.5g dried cubes. <br />I did write a trip report about that night where things progressed Psilacetin to MDMA to 2C-B. I was hoping to start all of that off with a much stronger tryptamine high but hey it was still awesome.<br />anyway i digress because i doubt that has anything to do with dexedrine.<br /><br />whirl
