				I&#039;m an experienced opiate user and if I do too much in a short period of time, or if I take them too late in the day and don&#039;t get a decent night&#039;s sleep, in the morning my face will be red along with my eyes. I&#039;ve tried taking all kinds of anti-histamines to no avail.<br /><br />It got so bad a few days ago that people thought I had an eye infection, and it&#039;s only in one eye for some reason. I had taken a dose Monday around noon, another dose Tuesday around noon, another dose Wednesday morning around 9am, then another dose Wednesday night around 8:30pm (just before this dose, my face was starting to get red, eyes were fine though), then Thursday morning my face was beat red, dried out where the redness was, and my left eye was really bloodshot, the right eye was slightly red, but not as bad as the left.<br /><br />It got a little better Friday, then better again this morning. I went to the doctor a few hours ago and he claimed there was an infection, but do infections get better on their own? Also, it must not have been a contagious infection because I&#039;m sure it would have passed from my left eye to my right, but it hasn&#039;t.<br /><br />Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know how to prevent it from happening (short of stop taking my DOC, which is hydrocodone and oxycodone btw)? I don&#039;t know if it matters, but I have to avoid codeine, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and heroin of course as they all cause respiratory depression at recreational doses. Also, they don&#039;t give me euphoria at ALL!<br /><br />I&#039;m just trying to figure out why I have an allergic/histamine reaction to HC and OC under certain circumstances. There&#039;s got to be something I can do to stop that from happening in the future.<br /><br />If anyone can provide any advice or tips to help me out here, I&#039;d certainly appreciate it, thanks!

				If one anti-histamine doesnt help, take another. If that doesnt help it is extremely unlikely you are suffering from a histamine reaction... Plus it sounds like an infection in the first place. Histamine would have been released extremely quickly, not the next day. Your body has an immune system, it can normally clear most infections by itself, if it didnt we would die of colds. <br /><br /><br />You said you avoid all the others because of respiratory depression, while oxy and hydro are also opioids and activate the mu receptor, just like all the others. Are you suggesting oxycodone and hydrocodone dont cause respiratory depression, because that is incorrect.
