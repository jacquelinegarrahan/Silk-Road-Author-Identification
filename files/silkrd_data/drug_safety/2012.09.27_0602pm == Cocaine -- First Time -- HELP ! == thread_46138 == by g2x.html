Do a small line, just a bump if its really quality, and then if you feel like you want more, delay gratification for at least an hour preferably two or more. In the meantime sip on a drink or two. You will want more, and you will do more, in a single night or sesssion if you have the supply, just really be sure to pace yourself coke is a powerful drug especially when its not 70% baby powder, so pace yourself.

				Ah the best feeling in the world is when I get great coke after a while of not having any....<br /><br />Cut up some chop stick sized lines after work and BAM.....brace for heart attack....(20 minutes later) whew I&#039;m going to live today...lolol just kidding(kinda)<br /><br /><br />Like others said if you have an addictive personality no matter how good the coke is, you will kill it in hours if you don&#039;t learn how to control it from the beginning.&nbsp; This might help, because for me it is very true.&nbsp; Lets say you did two small or 1 medium sized line, then you do it 10 minutes later, and another 10 minutes later again.&nbsp; You will just be wasting coke because you should still be peaking by then and the extra coke isn&#039;t really going to add anything other then added side effects ie, sweating, possibly shaking, uneasiness/anxiousness, and rapid heart heart rate which in result will kill your euphoria altogether.&nbsp; Now if the coke is good quality and not cut with other stimulants, it won&#039;t be that bad unless you do big lines however my first two points still stand true.&nbsp; Just like weed once you reach that high after smoking a lot you can&#039;t get higher by doing more.&nbsp; Just wait till the effects are almost all gone(you should feel VERY calm and almost sleepy/tired if it is quality coke) so you can rail a line and get that satisfying rush of euphoria again.&nbsp; <br />

				mate, lims right - firstly rub a tiny bit on your gums to make sure you dont have a bad reaction to it, then after about 20 minutes (that will be long enough to tell if you&#039;re gonna have a reaction to it) rack up a fucking HOOFA - your first line of coke is the best mate, hoofa of a line and you and your mates will chatting absolute codshit for at least a coupla hours, and you will feel like the MAN.<br /><br />if its quality coke you won&#039;t get a racing heart, you won&#039;t feel like its gonna jump out of your chest, you&#039;ll just feel like clark kents alter ego<br /><br />from personal experience i&#039;d say go with dutchaanbod - he has some quality gear. apparently c63amg&#039;s is good, and from what i&#039;ve read you can&#039;t go wrong with italiano

				try to understand this drug better..simply put its the devil and only purpose is to make the ppl hustln it rich lol thats my opnion any way . there will always be ppl that beg to differ buti sold the shit for years and it brought nothing but troubles.&nbsp; but you are going to try it anyway im sure so i think you should go balls to the wall, ive done over 20grams in one night and i was fine. miserable, but alive and kicking. then again i have lots of will power and dont take a liking to uppers of any kind. you will be fine as long as you do no more than a ball (3.5g) in no less than an hour or two. again you can get just as high of hhalf that amount in double that time, pending on lots of variables. you will be able to feel it out. its just a matter of the next day or next weekend when you itching for another 8ball lol. on the other hand the first two or three times i did the shit way back when i didnt feel a thing aside from irritablity, paranoia( mainly cause cops in nyc are cunts and a dealer can never rest) and a terrible taste and drip running down my throat. now id have to say the biggest variable in doing blow is the shit itself , has to be as RAW as possible for your side effects to be minimal and not absolutly miserable and gross. RAW RAW RAW. only i cant describe how to haveyou tell good shit from garbage over the internet and im not going to go into cooking. but a few good quick ways to determine rough potency is&nbsp; A. smell you want it to bight your nose kind of, almost like viniger does, only a little different. B. you can drop a small amount in some water and the shit that falls off immediatly and drops to the bottom is the cut, the coke will not break down and stay seperate. any smell of acetone or anything that strong is a no go( kerosine smell almost /gasoline like smell). too oily=no good but too dry and powdery is not good either, also rocks dont mean shit, some of the rawest soft ive ever had was powdered. everything you get will be stepd on/cut or any one fo rthat matter . bricks right out of mexico are stepd already lol. hope some of what i had to say will help you . good luck stay safe!&nbsp; ps dont mix any benxos or downers of any kind not even alchahol for this will keep you not too high and never to drunk only leading you down a nasty road .

				Just realized OP has a double of this thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46135.0 (September 27, 2012, 05:46 PM)<br />Perhaps delete the above link, there&#039;s no point of having two threads exactly the same. I have deleted my comment there, and added it below.<br /><br />Hope this helps you, I&#039;m an experienced cocaine user, who has purchased from a lot of the vendors.<br /><br />1. Buy the best you can afford (italiano, c63mg, dutchaanbod, and LloydsBrothers) are all good bets, italiano&#039;s is supposed to be THE BEST (I haven&#039;t tried, but I have some en-route), but I believe at this moment in time, he&#039;s down to .1 (100mg) samples, so get in quick if you want to try it. Trying definitive coke for the first time is the best way to go about it, as you&#039;ll know what high purity blow is all about, and will give you a litmus test to compare with any other cokes you try in the future.<br />2. Good quality coke might be a little damp, don&#039;t worry about this leave it to dry under a hot lamp, or hot plate (not too hot though, I leave mine for a min in the microwave, no more), personally I prefer the hot lamp, or leave the coke with rice for a day or so, it&#039;ll soak up all the moisture. Why do this? It&#039;ll last you longer, less waste, will be much easier to chop, will be better to sniff and easier on the nose.<br />3. Make sure you have a sitter with you, first time your administrating any new drug, always have a sitter with you, it&#039;s called being sensible.<br />4. Rub some on your gums, wait 20 minutes to ensure you have no reaction to it.<br />5. Ensure you have a hard surface, I like a small mirror so you can see everything, razor blade (it&#039;s much better at chopping then a card), and a straw, straws are much cleaner than notes, notes can carry a lot of bacteria, and do you really want to stiff through something that&#039;s been through numerous hands. Think about it. Always use a straw :)<br />6. First time line, there&#039;s two ways of going about this, 500mg, it&#039;ll blow your head off and you&#039;ll never forget the experience, or 100mg and work it up, it&#039;s to do with how brave your feeling, and if you want your head blown off or wish to go gradually. Wait for 10-15 minutes for the onset of euphoria to incur, and chattiness, you won&#039;t want to stop talking, you should feel on top of the world, break for as long as you need to, then repeat as necessary. Remember if you do 500mg in a line, you won&#039;t need to to this the second time, stick to 100mg, if it&#039;s quality, you don&#039;t need to do big lines, it&#039;s a waste, the only exception to this, of course, is your first ever line and if your feeling brave!<br />7. Enjoy the ride, and remember the experience forever :)<br /><br />If you have any further queries please don&#039;t hesitate to ask, I&#039;ll be more than happy to help you :)
