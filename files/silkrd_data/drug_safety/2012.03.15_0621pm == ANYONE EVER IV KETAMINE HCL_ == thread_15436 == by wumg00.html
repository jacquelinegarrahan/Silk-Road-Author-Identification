				whats up wumg, I have been thinking about ordering a little bit of that new batch of H to try it out, sounds delicious. your earlier stuff was great so really interested if the current stuff is even better. <br /><br />as for the IV ketamine I have never tried it but have read a number of reports and the general consensus by most is that they find it wayyy too intense and overwhelming. i think generally sticking to IM or SC is recommended for K<br /><br />if you do decide to try the IV, I would have someone else do the injection considering you will be in no state of mind to remove the needle safely! i think the recommended starting dose would be maybe around 20 mg unless you have a decent tolerance. <br /><br />you could check out bluelight: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/415224-Ketamine-IV-First-Time-Beyone-lego-land-insanity<br /><br />Be safe bro, have fun! <br />- miR

				I have never spiked Ket but have heard IM injection is much better than IV for the shit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if you have ever sniffed it but if you know your standard dose nasally I would quarter that and IM.&nbsp; Although giving dosing information is very bad IMO, I think your best bet would be to search erowid.com or as microRNA suggested blulight.&nbsp; Hope it helps bro!<br /><br />peace<br />Bupebuddy

				I&#039;ve done IM ketamine a few times. It&#039;s a much cleaner high than snorting, and the fact that you need only about 20% of the dose isn&#039;t bad either. <br /><br />But you do NOT want to IV it. That&#039;s way too fucking dangerous. The required dose will be even smaller than via the IM route, which means you&#039;re much more likely to overdose due to a small measuring error. And even if you don&#039;t the difference between a sub-k-hole dose and an anesthesia dose will be so small that you&#039;ll probably have the hardest fucking time getting the right amount of the drug into your body. You&#039;ll either not trip hard enough or just black out for ninety minutes.

I def think that if I do decide to spike it, I will stick to IM as I recall IVing pcp when I was young (and stupid lol) and, man, was that ever FAR TOO INTENSE for me and since K is pretty much in the same category as pcp IMO I dont think I want to relive that adventure haha!<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t IV K... it&#039;s not very much fun... it comes on REALLY quickly (within 10 - 45 seconds) and it&#039;s gone really quickly (within a few minutes).<br /><br />You just feel dizzy and sick, possibly losing consciousness for a brief period of time (60 secs to 120 secs) and just sort of come to with the syringe with blood dripping from it.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not pleasant and it&#039;s kind of retarded unless you are having surgery done.<br /><br />Now IM&#039;ing K.... that, my friend, is the only way to fly.&nbsp; You can do just fine with 1/2&quot; or 5/8&quot; insulin syringes into your deltoid muscle.&nbsp; Start with 20mg to 30mg.... 50mg t o75mg is my usual strong dose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, so yeah, just go directly into your deltoid, press as deep as you can so the needle gets past the layer of fat in your arm (so you hit the muscle), then slowly press 0.5mL to 1mL of solution into the muscle over a period of 30 secs to 60 secs.<br /><br />After you do this, the warm glow of proper trippy K will hit you within about 3 mins and last about 45 mins , and you&#039;ll be completely back to normal within 60 mins.&nbsp; &nbsp; Careful&nbsp; mixing this with opiates though cause that can cause nausea.&nbsp; In summary, IV K sucks, and IM K is great.<br /><br />

				Hi Wumg,&nbsp; i use to iv k when i was yunger and stupid too, i remember i kinda like it at the time, the upcoming was a rosewater taste in the throath (the k i use to do was from india and they use to put a little of rose water in it to mask the product at customs, busted way...long time ago...) followed by a gradual disassembly of your body and almost everytime an out of body experiece...of course no more body=out of body!! I tell you the truth, if i think about it now it make me almost sick though...way too strong and too hardcore!!<br />IM is the perfect fly, as somebody said before!Way less direct but really effective,whitouth destroying your nose and &quot;evenly distributed&quot; in all you body! man how many trips like that!! <br />And i dont know how it is for you but (i was,i am and i will always be a total oppiophil,loyal to the Poppy!) i&nbsp; noticed that in my body opiods and K DONT GO ALONG!!! If there is an opiate (and since 15 years theres always been in a form or another...) in me and i take K i dont feel well, the trip is different, &quot;dark&quot; i would describe it... just Not good at all, even dangerous i think...(the only exeption was when i was on subbies, or on VERY LOW level of methadon (5-15mg)...then&nbsp; i could use k as normal as far as i remember, cause we are talking of 10 years ago more or less...).<br />But at the same time i remember friends that where iv H and then im K like is was water w/o any bad side effects...<br />i use to like K a lot,i think is a really complex and powerful drugs, whith a lot of different effects, but i think i used her so much that she doesnt have nothing to tell me anymore...if you understand what i mean...<br />I forgot to mention that other substances i think are pretty dangerous with K are benzos ...but i think you already know this things..<br /><br />Any way if you want to experiment with iv k, yes it&#039;s doable, just use of course all the precautions, be ready to lose conciosness, better if you try im first so you gradually get to the idea of what to expect (also doing so you can manage the dosage...), but be prepared to disappear for a while , youll come back though!! I think at the end of the day K is a pretty safe substance, as far as i know i never heard of anyone OD on it, at least not directly, if you are careful with the enviroment your are in, even better if there is somebody whatching over you!! You can go in K hole , but if youre are in a safe place you just &quot;sleep&quot; (yeah rigth that&#039;s what it looks like from the outside, but youre are tripping your ass off!!!) for a while and then come back home clean and safe... but please be careful whit opies+K!<br />Thats my two cents wumg, and of course cant wait to try your H, i just ordered by Noriega as my first order since i&#039;m in europe, but i will contact you in the future for sure!!! <br /><br />Poppyfield<br />Always Loyal to the POppy!

				PS!!!: Quote --I think at the end of the day K is a pretty safe substance, as far as i know i never heard of anyone OD on it, at least not directly,--<br />of course when i say so it doesnt mean you can inject it like water!!!! always be careful with the doses, but i think you know those things better than me! just use the same precaution you would use with H or C...<br />&nbsp;What i mean is that if you already injected H or expecially Coke you should have no problem tryng K...i think Coke is way more dangerous to play with...if you get what i mean!!<br />play safe<br />PPFielD<br />Trust in Poppy

				hi wumg, <br />&quot; I was just wondering what being in europe had to do with ordering from Noriega?&quot;<br />just the impatience to have the product as soon as possible, i guess...I have past experience of mail from Holland and in a cople of working days were here...but i told ya , as soon as i have some btcs&nbsp; youre on top of my list eheh..!<br /><br />update:&nbsp; fuxxx Hell you cant believe what happened today: i was answering ya this morning and i just bend over a little bit on the laptop...i start screaming for the pain and went on the floor unable to move..i have a very bad back with 5 erniated disks from few years but i was feeling pretty good, i mean i was working last night...fuxxx i had to call the ambulance, the only good thing was when i heard&quot; i think we have to give you some morphine...&quot; i said well if you really have to ...!!! so at the beginning they couldnt find a good vein, and she said &quot;i&#039;m sorry pal but if we dont find a good spot you have to stick to gas and air (wich is not bad, when my wife was in&nbsp; in labour i had a lot of fun with it eheheh!!)&quot; so i had to unmask myself and give them a hint, too bad she was injecting so slowly, i dint ask her how many mg she gave me but i didnt feel it too much, 60mg of methadon a day and your opiods receptors are almost full i guess...well i&#039;m home now but with a back pain that is killing me and they didnt give me nothing more than diclofenac at the emergency...tomarrow will go to my gp an will see, also tomarrow could be good news in the mail, i really hope so!!!! <br /><br />See you guys...<br />Poppy forever!<br /><br />

Nothin beats mephedrone, ketamine, and hydromorphone in the same shot.<br /><br />IV K is not as &quot;trippy&quot;, causes amnesia during the peak, and wears off way too quick to be a good route of administration most of the time. It&#039;s a fun rush/novelty.<br /><br />Make sure to filter your K through a micron wheel filter before IVing it.
