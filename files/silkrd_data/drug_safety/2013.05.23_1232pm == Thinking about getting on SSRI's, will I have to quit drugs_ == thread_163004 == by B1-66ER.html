				SSRI - Suicide - Shootings<br /><br />FDA hearing: Board members aware of the possible connection between increased suicide and the administration of SSRI to patients. Continue to produce and distribute the medication regardless of a seemingly obvious, and fatal, defects. <br /><br />#1 Prescribing entity of SSRI is the US Military. Rates of suicide among combat veterans have sky rocketed. There have been more deaths associated with soldiers committing suicide than recorded from combat casualties in Afghanistan War. Uncle Sam does not have to pay for VA benefits when a Veteran offs himself... Penny saved is a penny earned.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you think something is &quot;wrong&quot; with you I would suggest you do the following:<br /><br />1. Throw away your TV - Capitalism and commercialism is based on making you feel less than perfect. We&#039;re constantly being convinced that what we have isn&#039;t good enough and that in order to feel complete or good, we need to purchase unnecessary products to sedate those feelings.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Be very concerned about your diet of what is going into your body. Sugars and processed foods specifically. You are what you eat and a diet of vegetables, fruits, lean meats, fish, nuts and berries will dramatically improve your health, drop unnecessary weight and clear the addiction fog to glucose/gluten and sugars. <br /><br />3. Exercise - Do some push ups right now. Don&#039;t think about it. <br /><br />Rinse repeat. <br /><br />Do not give those fucks any of your money.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Although the above post is full of advice, I&#039;d say that some TV now and again is hardly going to turn you into a mind comtrolled slave.<br /><br />I like sports.<br /><br />Now as for SSRI&#039;s, I know a few people who have been on these. If your feeling depressed then your main enemy in a lack of motivation. I actually trained to be a social worker and did study depression a lot and have practical experience through family members who needed care when depressed.<br /><br />I&#039;m also married so have a great in-depth actual experience of depression! (joke)<br /><br />Lifestyle can be changed of course, exercise is a MUST for anyone really especially if your feeling low, but as to whether you can take any recreational illegal type drugs whilst on SSRI&#039;s, I think its agreed that stimulant drugs are not really benefical not least due to many people going through depression due to dependence on stimulants. <br /><br />Ecstasy might help IF you can have someone to take care of you when your using it. Using E when on SSRI&#039;s is a no no. We are seeing some results now of actual legal use of MDMA with respects to conselling. Having used MDMA, I think its fantastic for opening people up - alowing them to really talk about things. It saves months of actual counselling - and even then some people especially men, will not open up!<br /><br />Wuh cocaine, I could cite examples in which the combination of SSRIs and coke might be&nbsp; dangerous. Common sense says that anyone depressed ought to avoid &#039;quick fixes&#039; apart from sex in a relationship or whatever consesual things make you happy. Cocaine is for when all is well in life - a little celebration. That way its used a few times a year. For people with depression, cocaine is not a good thing to be using.<br /><br />Nor is speed! That is a quick fix and good quality speed will make anyone more motivated. However, the side effects outweigh the benefits. <br /><br />The downside of SSRIs is that they can effect your sexual mechanics. I was once told by a GP that SSRIs were more likely to make men depressed when they find they cannot fire off a salute to the maiden in question. But depression or anxiety generally makes people less in the mood for love. As does working in a wet windy field with some &#039;waterproof&#039; equipment that seems to have fused out with water. <br /><br />So I&#039;m depressed also. Cannot even build a joint. Be pointless taking E, and not even a cokehead would want line in this attrocious weather. Snow is predicted also. I&#039;m sick of the fucking UK and wish I was sitting on some beach, a nice fruity alcohol laden drink, a joint of hash and a topless beach. I study art. A regular art lover. To me its just art&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />So - back to the SSRI - yes, you should avoid drugs and collect your thoughts and try not to be so down on yourself as I&#039;m sure you have talents and skills which can divert you until such a time as your ready to party. <br /><br />Don&#039;t isolate yourself from family and friends. And NEVER keep things to yourself. Talk your problems over. Having them spin around in your own head will do nothing but make your more worried. You&#039;ll magnify your problems, stack them up and not see them as a series of things you need to do and that I&#039;m sure you can do.<br /><br />So, leave out the drugs for now. Try therapy with any use of SSRIs as this is proven to help more. If you got people close to you who you can talk to - do that.<br /><br />Avoid stimulants right now as your vulnerable to addiction. Any drug that just make you &#039;happy&#039;, would be too much of a temptation. Many people fall into addiction when they are at their lowest. My advice is to use drugs as a special treat - especially stimulants. I only use those things when I feel good and am careful to not fall into any habit apart from bud and hash which is like a cup of tea to the average English male.<br /><br />Good luck by the way. At least you&#039;ve manned up and admitted to yourself that not all is well. About in 4/5 people will be affected by some mental health issue in their lives but the ones who do best are the ones who realise that feeling unhappy all the time for no reason is not that great. And like it or not, meds do help some people.<br /><br />Thanks for being brave enough to broach this topic, and I think that people who use drugs ought to be responsible and bear in mind that some overuse might be a sign of depression. <br /><br />Hope things go well.<br /><br />Now, back into the windy field we go!<br /><br />Wish it was shroom season as were walking around a field all day.

				Stop listening to the NWO/Illuminati/other batshit insane conspiracy theorists to start.<br /><br />SSRIs work for some, not all. They didn&#039;t work for my depression (and I tried MANY) but that doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t work for yours.<br /><br />Anyways, most serotonin acting drugs should be avoided.<br />MDMA/Ecstasy won&#039;t work.<br />LSD will likely be inhibited.<br />Cocaine is a TRI (triple-reuptake inhibitor) so some effects may be enhanced or diminished.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to take an illicit substance, simply search around for Substance X + SSRI; and use your brain to sort through what is druggie bullshit and what is found by legitimate user experience. Look at the drug&#039;s means of action; if it relates to serotonin, taking it could be meaningless or dangerous. If your antidepressant trials extend to an SNRI, you&#039;ll also need to view norepinephrine means of action as a concern. When placed on tricyclics, numerous different problems can arise; and if you&#039;re finally at the bottom-of-the-barrel taking MAOIs, you&#039;ll have to watch everything you intake- not just drugs, but food itself.

				First and foremost, decide if you really want to take SSRI&#039;s in the first place. They are effective in moderate and severe depression, bu appplication for other problems like anxiety is disputable at best.<br /><br />If you do decide to take ssri&#039;s, there are certain drugs that will change in effect. Substances like mdma and lsd will probably be ineffective at normal dosages. Things like alcohol and benzo&#039;s will still work when on ssri&#039;s, though your experiences may be different from what you were used to. <br /><br />Also, srri&#039;s are a 24/7 commitment, not drugs you can only take when you need them to perform a certain function or seek any effect in particular. The efficacy of ssri&#039;s seems to very wildly between individuals. but they are not substances to be taken lightly. There can be true benefit for some, but they seem to be prescribed &#039;off label&#039; for all kinds of conditions nowadays, and you really should investigate if they are a solution for whatever issue you are taking them for.<br /><br />One thing they often cause is apathy though, so after starting treatment you may no longer care that much about the (side) effects, which is why i&#039;d suggest you read up on them thoroughly before taking any.

				I always say keep ssris and snri&#039;s as a last resort, they will permanently alter your brain chemistry which can be detrimental to your physical and mental health especially if taken long term. Try isolating what in your life is making you depressed and fix it. I know that sounds like hokum but its usually one or two things that are the root of the problem. Keep some fast acting benzos and ketamine around for the times when its really bad but stay off pharmaceutical anti depressants as long as you can.

				What would be the point keeping SSRI&#039;s at hand? Their mechanism of action is so slow they will not do anything useful for you within the first week or so. <br /><br />Keeping some benzo&#039;s at hand makes perfect sense if you are experimenting with things like hallucinogens, but srri&#039;s will not do anything useful for you on the short term. <br /><br />It&#039;s not like you could just pop a prozac and feel better in hours. In most cases you will feel far worse for the first week or so, after which you can find some benefit in the treatment if you suffer from a condition suitable for ssri medication. <br /><br />As for permanently altering brain chemistry: there is little evidence to support its really permanent, but the effects certainly are long term and can affect you weeks or even months after you stop taking them. Unfortunately this is often taken very lightly by physicians that seem eager to prescribe them off label for all kinds of mental issues. This is quite a big problem in general medicine, as ssri&#039;s have only be proven effective for moderate depression and any other use should be considered experimental.

Mentally the main effect simply is that the mdma will not, or hardly, have an effect. Unfortunately serotonin is a neurotransmitter not exclusive to the brain, and the ssri&#039;s will affect its reabsorption in the body as well. In extreme situations this can lead to a dangerous condition mostly known as serotonin syndrome. While not common at &#039;normal&#039; dosages, this condition can be fatal in some cases.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SSRI&#039;s have one of the worst physical addictions which always changes brain chemistry, it might not be permanent but you arent yourself for months even years after stopping them.

The indication was anxiety, not depression. The first week i felt a bit ill, and a bit like i was speedballing (sort of sensation that you would get from doing ephedrine and valium at the same time, not the total heroin-cocaine fuckup). <br /><br />It never helped to cure the problem though, but i had little difficulty quitting them either. Went down from 40 mg/day to 30, 20, 10, and after a month or so never took one again, and never felt the urge to either. Oddly it is policy in holland to try ssri&#039;s as a first line of medication and only prescribe benzo&#039;s if 2 different srri&#039;s have not resolved the problem. Obviously i did not go for any attempt at another ssri since their mechanism of action is virtually identical. <br /><br />As a biochemist i expected the effect of feeling unwell for a bit initially and some apathy once stabilized. These happened as expected, but the bad part of it all was that they did not affect the problem it began with at all. I&#039;m still curious why in it policy to prescribe ssri&#039;s for isolated anxiety problems in the netherlands though, since a simple script for &#039;up to 2 mg aplrazolam a day, if needed&#039; would have been an excellent and very cheap solution. It is what i would have concluded myself based on research data - leaving me with the idea it can be better to consult pubmed instead of a general physician...&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I used to take SSRI&#039;s before I began experimenting with &quot;other means&quot; (can&#039;t vouch for them yet, I&#039;m still my own guinea pig and won&#039;t vouch for anyone unorthodox methods until I can say with 100% certainty i&#039;m cured of depression/anxiety). But I do know this, SSRI&#039;s block all the fun effects of drugs with the exception of opiates and benzos (in my experience) and make me more prone to violence. When I say more prone to violence, I mean plotting violence against others while maintaining a facade of normalcy, as in procuring weapons/ammo in the most creative/cunning ways imaginable and having stashes in 4 different cities praying for one motherfucker to make me snap, all while hiding this from my psychiatrist, family, friends, and my job. Im not gonna jump on a soapbox and call all psych meds evil, hell I take Seroquel to sleep and it helps me tons, but SSRI&#039;s are the gay. That&#039;s all I gotta say.

They drown out your personality and general creativity. I guess that works for your average American sheep but this is SR. Ketamine is shown to be one of the most effective anti depressants, you dont take it everyday, it works in minutes and most importantly you dont become dependent on it. Have you ever been on SSRI&#039;s for more than a week or two? You cant miss a dose or you start getting brain zaps that will make a normal person suicidal.

				SSRIs don&#039;t work for everyone. Even if it did work, it usually requires trial and error of a few different brands. Finding a good doctor or psychiatrist is difficult. Then having them correctly diagnose what type of depression you have in addition to the drugs that work is another hurdle. I would recommend you seek (speech based) therapy first, and keep SSRIs as a second line. They tend to work better on the severely depressed, but it might motivate you just enough to kill yourself before you it brings you up to almost normal levels. <br /><br />To answer your question, you can still use drugs. Just make sure they don&#039;t have overlapping pathways like MAOI with Meth for example.

People that share their personal experience with a substance in order to inform others?<br /><br />One major problem with SSRI&#039;s is that they are often prescribed for ailments other than depression. For that indication they have been proven effective in several cases, and there would not be much of an argument against at least trying them as an option. <br /><br />The issue is that they a prescribed off-label for all kinds of mental problems, from generalized anxiety to ocd, and they are not approved for that use by the fda or similar agencies in europe. I am by no means on a crusade against SSRI&#039;s here, but i would like to see a situation in which they are prescribed only for conditions they have been demonstrated effective to treat. In all other cases it should be made very clear to the patient that the treatment is experimental, will have unpleasant side effects, and could worsen symptoms in some cases... not in a leaflet, but told by the prescribing physician face to face.

				Thinking back, i don&#039;t really know any either. <br /><br />Then again, most people would keep such a thing to themselves, so its perfectly feasible i have worked with people on ssri&#039;s quite often. You cannot really see if someone is suffering from moderate depression at first glance, and it could very well be that a fair number of them overcame this problem by using ssri&#039;s at some point in life.<br /><br />From the people that do tell i get the sense that the majority feel that ssri&#039;s &quot;fucked them up&quot; or at least had mostly negative effects.

				Oh my; let&#039;s get things straight here:<br /><br />1) SSRIs and other pharms can indeed be harmful, but some of you guys are using heavy drugs which have a high profile for damage at an even moderate level of usage--much less habituated.<br /><br />Honestly, these drugs can indeed help; I for one, in a bout of serious depression, do not think as clearly without a low dose of SSRIs.&nbsp; It is completely possible that a person need only to motivate themselves in order&nbsp; retract the effects; however, in true clinical depression, one cannot just &quot;jump out of it&quot;.&nbsp; That said, exercise and diet do play a significant role. <br /><br />2) On SSRIs, any drugs that affect serotonin receptors will be largely inhitibited by very virtue of what an SSRI is (Serotonin Inhibitor).&nbsp; So, if you did do seroternergic drugs, you&#039;d need large quantities of them as the SSRI is effectively blocking the absorption of the molecule (look up competitive inhibition). <br /><br />--Psychedelics will require a LARGE dose in order to get you to the same point because they work on similar receptors. <br />--MDMA is dangerous IMO because it&#039;s a serotonergic drug.&nbsp; It would seem that serotonin syndrome is likely because you&#039;ll have an explosion of serotonin that can&#039;t be reuptaked. <br /><br />Other drugs should be fine. I&#039;ve used Opiates/Weed/Coke(not to safe either), and I was largely fine.<br /><br />Research and see what receptors these drugs affect. If it says 5HT, then it&#039;s largely iffy with SSRIs and it.

SJW does not have the side effects of the SSRIs, they are very mild and you can keep your sexiness!!<br /><br />SJW is a MAOI and should not be combined with other similar drugs, this is very important. Combining with ecstacy like drugs seems ok though, but do your own research!<br /><br />With lower side effects and fewer drugs made unsafe in combination, it is a good thing to suggest this as a first step in antidepressants.

				I don&#039;t judge using cures from nature if you can, but synthetics are often more effective and/or have fewer side effects.<br /><br />Perhaps the classic example for this is willow bark. That does contain sialyc acid which is somewhat efffective as a nsaid. If you synthesize aspirin from that, you end up with something that is more potent and has fewer side effects.<br /><br />Whilst not 1:1 comparable, st johns wort could be seen as the natural source of ssri&#039;s. The synthetic analogues perform far better though, and would be preferable to the plant if available.

				Ofcourse there are many drugs that do not depend on the serotonin system and still have effect when on ssri&#039;s. This ranges from alcohol and tobacco to heroin. <br /><br />In your case i&#039;d be more worried to be on a drug that causes suicide attempts when you stop using it. <br /><br />Suddenly stopping certain drugs can be deadly, but usually that is not self inflicted. For the record i should, however, say that attempting suicide is NOT a common side effect of SSRI cessation in general, certainly not when you taper off as recommended.

On them you experience emotions more superficially, which is the desired effect where negative ones are concerned, but it also applies to the positive ones. A consequence could be that you land on a sofa, and will be comfortable remaining there. It probably will not feel bad, but not good either - you just have little reason to get off that sofa unless you need to use the bathroom.
