				So me and a mate plan on smoking hash for the first time tonight as a pose to bud,<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a bong or pipe where I am and I was wondering if the following would work with a bit of afghan gold seal:<br /><br />1. Put hash on tinfoil<br />2. Light under the tin foil to warm it up<br />3. crumble it in to tobacco<br />4. roll that shit up and smoke it.<br /><br />Will this work? The tinfoil thing is just sort of a guess of a way to heat it up and crumble it?<br />cheers<br />J

				Why use tin foil? I think you will lose quality. Just crumle it as it is and put it into a joint and smoke it.<br />

				Either roll it into very, very thin little worms and roll with tobacco or make your self a bong out of a plastic bottle, or a pipe out of a coke can or an apple or something! Enjoy.

				If it requires burning, you can just put one side very close to a lighter to heat it and then try to disperse the heat with your fingers to make it soft. The aluminum foil will work too though and you won&#039;t need to hold the hash while heating but some with probably just stick to the foil.. Then again, you could just use the foil to smoke your hash, like chasing the dragon, without using any tobacco.

				You can just use a lighter and burn it a little to make is a bit softer. Otherwise use a grinder.<br />You can make it crumble in your hands. Just need to have nails and use pressure.<br /><br />Tin foil seems like a bad idea. The foil can contaminate the hash.<br /><br /><br />

				I say skip the tin foil. just roll it up with your tobacco or joint. If your hash is too hard to manipulate with your hands, just pass a lighter flame on it a few times to heat it up.

				Also, you can just get a safety pin or some sort of metal poker, and stick a piece on the end, light that fucker till its on fire, then blow it out, and have a straw in your lips. Sort of like chasing the dragon, only with hash 8)<br /><br />This tek is good for smoking with a friend, as it will always be burning, if your going to do this alone, i suggest only putting what you can inhale in one monster toke.

				thanks for all the advice, will skip the tin foil.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been told that putting hash in a grinder is a big no no?

				/\ yisz, refrain from doing that.. it will only get all mushed into your grinder.<br /><br />If its too hard to crumble, just toast it for a second or two with the lighter, it will get very soft and easy to crumble.

				True that. Use a lighter till it burns then quickly blow it out. Using a grinder is a big no no if the has is expensive for you. Here it&#039;s ok. Just use the grinder for the hash. Although it depends on what grinder. Weed grinders are destroyed when using hard hash.<br /><br />Don&#039;t expect a high when using tobacco. It will get you stoned, not high. to get high you need no tobacco in your system.<br />You can also make delicious tea out of it. But then you still need to grind it a bit....<br /><br />Good luck and enjoy :)

				How to prepare hash very much depends on consistency of the Hash....however the main thing that you would do to every hash is heat it before rolling it in to joint as it will release locked OIls. If you use vaporizer it will have to be heated naturally :)<br /><br />With SuperBall as an example once heated on a needle it beautifully melts and can easily be rubbed in to tobacco. Never touch the flame to good hash...just enough to soften and warm the oils, if you don&#039;t want to de-nature your THC :P<br /><br />I think when you think of smoking Hash, the most important things are heat, ratio&#039;s and even distribution, so you can enjoy your joint to the maximum :)<br /><br />

				Most people I know roll Squidgy Black into spliff-long snakes and just smoke it with tobacco. IMO cannabis and tobacco synergize well.<br />I do find a lot of top quality hash hard to prepare, it usually depends specifically on the type in question. Never knew you shouldn&#039;t burn it with a flame though. I must have ruined a fair bit of top-notch stuff doing this!&nbsp; ::)
