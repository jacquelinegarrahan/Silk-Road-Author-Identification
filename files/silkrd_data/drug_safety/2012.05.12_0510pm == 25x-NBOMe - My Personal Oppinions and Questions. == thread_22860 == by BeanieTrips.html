				Hello all. I&#039;d like to introduce myself to the community first of all.<br /><br />I go by the name of BeanieTrips on this wonderful bastion of hope in such a dark world. Over the course of my psychedelic career I have taken Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms over a dozen times, ranging from a half eighth, up to a full quarter, always lab grown. I&#039;ve taken an eighth of Psilocybe Azurescens once. I&#039;ve recently taken LSD once after many times buying it locally, only to be sold a research chemical, or complete garbage (no substance what-so-ever...the worst kind of rip-off). I did some form of freebase DMT once (it had a strong yellow color to it, so I suspect it was 5-MeO-DMT) while on a benzodiazepine, which I don&#039;t recommend to anyone, due to my horrible experience. I look forward to trying N,N-DMT soon, on a clear mind, and in a more stable environment. I&#039;ve taken 2C-I once, which was an unknown dose, and after the experience, I suspect the dose was miniscule. I tried 2C-E once, at 15mg. I really didn&#039;t enjoy that experience either. Far too much body load for my liking.<br /><br />Now to get to the point of this topic. 25I-NBOMe. I&#039;ve done quite a bit of &quot;research&quot; into this research chemical. My first time with it, I played it safe and dosed one hit of DudeRugs&#039;s 1000ug(1mg) HPBCD complexed 25I-NBOMe on blotter paper. The trip was very smooth and gentle for me. Keep in mind I researched this after experimenting with almost all of the above mentioned substances. I ask everyone to keep that in mind throughout this rather lengthy post. That night I was very happy. I experienced little to no body load, and had mediocre visuals, but very introspective. The next day I &quot;did it big&quot;. I woke up, and dosed three hits (3mg) of the same batch. Had a very introspective, and slightly more visual experience. With the increased dose though, I found a very uncomfortable body load. Muscle hypertension is a big negative, in my opinion, to this chemical. Once I hit baseline again, I re-dosed with two hits (2mg), followed by an estimated gram, to gram and a half of psilocybe cubensis, followed by another re-dose of two hits (2mg) about four hours later, followed by a final re-dose of 2 hits (2mg) four hours after that. About an hour after the last re-dose, I closed my very tired eyes, and went to sleep. I&#039;m sure not many people are capable of sleeping on psychedelics, but I am. I&#039;m attributing this to my experience, and the tolerance I had built up over the course of those two days. The experience of the night of the psilocybe cubensis, plus three re-doses of 25I-NBOMe was very interesting to me. At first it was very introspective and educating. After the second re-dose I spent a good bit of time staring into the stars. Very quickly I began mapping the stars in my mind. After a short time certain stars became brighter, and I watched as these bright stars slowly moved into alignment, giving me the overwhelming feeling that I was watching planets align. Once I had my fill of space mapping, I wandered into a small patch of woods, where I connected on a low level with nature. I felt a sense of peace and oneness while in nature. I felt the Earth&#039;s energy surging through me in a very peaceful way.<br /><br />My next experience with 25I-NBOMe was approximately a week afterward. I dose seven hits (7mg) on a night that I shouldn&#039;t have. I was extremely tired and didn&#039;t really think about what kind of decision I was making. This probably leads you to think I had a horrible experience, which in my eyes I did. I fell asleep about an hour after dosing, and slept like a rock until morning came. I don&#039;t have any recollection of dreams or anything other than a very bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />The following experience with 25I-NBOMe was much different. This time I decided to take a ride with friends to visit friends in other area. Before we left I dosed four hits (4mg). About an hour into it I started to notice a definite &quot;brain-fuck&quot; , as I like to call it, where not much makes complete sense to me. After about two hours after dosing, visuals hit me hard. I used a public bathroom in a gas station, which had tile floor. The tile had a very unique pattern to it, which in my eyes was not moving, but almost flowing under my feet. Motor control had greatly diminished, and social anxiety was definitely present. After about three hours I was incapable of speaking to people without sounding obviously under the influence of a substance. I found it near impossible to convey my thoughts to anyone clearly. While at one persons residence, I became fixated on a piece of metal-art that looked like flowers. This artwork bloomed continuously, and vigorously for the next thirty minutes to an hour. After the plateau passed and I began towards baseline, I had a profound introspect into my life, and the people I surround myself with. I aided the journey back to baseline with some good ol&#039; marijuana, which helped me calm myself, slow my mind down (which felt like it was going about 20x faster than normal), and begin speaking and conversing with others around me. This entire experience also gave me a sense of knowing others feelings, or empathy. This happens to me quite often though.<br /><br />Those are my experiences with 25I-NBOMe. Now, on to my questions. What have your experiences been? There&#039;s not a whole lot of solid research or studies done on this chemical, or it&#039;s family of chemicals, so I&#039;d like very much to compile as much information as possible, from people who are experienced psychonauts, as well as newcomers to the world of psychedelics.<br /><br />Also, I want to hear what everyone&#039;s experiences have been like with the other members of the 25x-NBOMe family. Specifically 25C-NBOMe. This is a chemical that has peaked my interest, especially after the very educating experiences 25I-NBOMe gave me.<br /><br />As a side note, I felt that I should also list some experiences shared by those close to me who decided to try 25I-NBOMe.<br /><br />Case 1 - Person had little experience with psychedelics. A few mushroom experiences, one or two 2C-x experiences. He dosed three hits (3mg) and had one of the worst experiences of his life. He was harassed by, let&#039;s say, negative forces. He experienced, possibly for the first time (adding to the bad experience), what I call time-warping. Almost every five to ten minutes his mind would hit a, sort-of, reset button. He would ask what time it was, what he just took, where he was, how he got there, and when will it be over. He experienced very very heavy visuals from his account, as well as the before mentioned body load. It took him a few weeks to get back to his normal state of being, which is average in my opinion when you finally have your first (and most likely last) mind shattering, box breaking psychedelic experience. I had this experience when I took a quarter of psilocybe cubensis. It is not fun, but it is very much something to be learned from.<br /><br />Case 2 - Person had even less experience with psychedelics. I believe he had taken mushrooms once or twice before. He decided to dose two hits (2mg). According to him, the first half of his experience was amazing and wonderful. He was filled with happiness and joy. As the experience lingered on, he became uncomfortable. He started to lose his ability to understand what exactly was happening, or what anyone was saying to him. He was unable to convey thoughts longer than three or five word sentences. Overall, he was displeased with the experience.<br /><br />Case 3 - Person had a fair amount of experience with psychedelics, including LSD and mushrooms. He also was a &quot;substance veteran&quot; in my view. He decided to dose two hits (2mg). His account to me, was that it wasn&#039;t a bad experience, very introspective. He stated that he was very easily distracted by little, say, distortions, around him. Overall he deemed it not enjoyable due to the body load, and said he wouldn&#039;t try it again.<br /><br />I&#039;m making this topic to promote safety and factual references for people to use with their own decisions.

				Hey man, +1 for compiling all the information you could.&nbsp; So far with my 25i experiences I have had AMAZING times.&nbsp; When taking it alone I have gained a TON of understanding about the world around me and when with a friend we have experienced all kinds of conscious telepathy etc...<br /><br />I will probably make a 25i Master thread soon since it seems to be the most interesting RC chemical at the moment and possibly could become the new LSD of our generation.<br /><br />Click on my name and run through some of my forum posts, I have a long 25i trip report and a lot of comments in other 25i threads....<br /><br />

				This was a really nice read. When I was researching this stuff, good information was scarce, and some sources were in contradiction about doses and effects. I suppose it still is, but at least reports like these are adding to the library on this substance. I&#039;ll chip in.<br /><br />Myself I&#039;ve tried 4 doses of duderugs complexed 25i-NBOMe, 250mcg, 500mcg, 1mg, 2mg (in that order) in the course of a month. In retrospect I should have spaced the experiments further out as tolerance probably played a role in my subsequent experiences (and/or a steeper dosage increase). Right now it&#039;s been about 3 weeks since I last used it and I plan on taking it again in a couple of weeks (with a different sheet). My previous psychedelic experiences are mushrooms (picked by myself, tried doses of 5, 15, 25, 35 local liberty caps, and much later and inbetween the 25i experiments, 2 grams administered by tea) and LSD, at 100mcg tops. Kind of chickened out on doing a larger LSD dose with the few tabs I had. Also been an evening toker for the past 2 years. If you&#039;re thinking &quot;lightweight&quot; you&#039;re correct, especially in this crowd&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />From my research I was expecting mushroom-like patterns but more vivid (someone wrote that their visuals looked three dimensional) MDMA-like euphoria and LSD-like headspace lasting 6-8 hours. I had also read that it was vasoconstricting which is a big reason for why I decided to dose on the cautious side. All experiments were done at home on a weekend with nothing particular scheduled.<br /><br />The 250mcg were taken just to see if I had any adverse reactions to this chemical. None were noted, the rest of the day I did feel a little bit calmer though and my mind was in a good (sober!) place. At the time I thought I may have been experiencing a threshold effect, but it was probably a placebo from thinking a lot about psychedelics that day. That mindset was not re-experienced in the following two experiments. I don&#039;t really remember much about the 500mcg experiment, I wrote down &quot;nothing happened&quot; in the journal and went about my day. <br /><br />For the 1mg dose (at 4am) I was anticipating something akin to what I&#039;ve come to know as &quot;a trip&quot;. In my mushroom tests I would spend some time looking around me, gauging my thoughts for any signs of non-sobriety, until I took a dose big enough to &quot;get it&quot;. Only then I would realize my previous threshold experiences for what they were. During this 25i experience I never felt I had entered a trip, although colors did seem more vivid and I certainly felt elevated. You know that part of the psychedelic experience is referred to as mind-expanding? That just wasn&#039;t there. My thoughts were sober, and I was a bit underwhelmed. Disappointed even. When the evening came I went for a walk and felt as though my hearing was sharper and that the sky was beautiful as always. Songs would be playing in my head, vividly, but this is something I can do well without drugs. A little bud in the night time was nice, but didn&#039;t have the sleepy effect I intended. Didn&#039;t fall asleep until about 3 am, rather late for me.<br /><br />A week later I placed 1 tab between gum and lip and one under the tounge, a total of 2mg before my morning shower. With doubts as to whether I had received HPBCD complexed blotter and without much anticipation I experienced what could only be a come-up, and it alone was probably more than all previous experiments. I spent the next 1-2 hours in my room, either interacting with the computer or laying in my bed, quite weirded out by what was happening. There was some bodily discomfort but nothing like nausea. It was at that time I decided that it was probably a bad idea having just ordered a larger sheet of this stuff. I decided to make the best of it and attempt to talk to my flatmate and his girlfriend which proved to be much pleasurable than anticipated. We had some light conversation and I felt quite sociable, but a little worried that I wasn&#039;t coherent in my dialog. They later said I was very understandable and still had my wits. By this time I was feeling what others had described as LSD headspace. The contents of the room outside of my periphery vision was anyones guess, although there was no joyful surprise awaiting when I did turn around to check it out, as I&#039;ve experienced on mushrooms. And certainly no fractal patterns. As before colors seemed brighter, the overcast daylight felt cold and prompted my to put on a wool sweater that I don&#039;t use much because it&#039;s very warm. That sweater stayed on for the rest of the day. At this point the I was getting quite comfortable with the trip and decided to play the guitar. Similarly to pot, music becomes a bit &quot;more&quot; on this substance, had a blast playing a mix of works that i had practiced and improvisation has never been more fun. During the playing one of the strings broke but it turned out that I was fully capable of installing new strings. For a while I just couldn&#039;t visualize how to tie a nylon-string knot and some time was spent looking for a book I have that describes the knot, even though I&#039;ve done it plenty of times before. The book was never found and yet somehow the knots were made perfectly. <br />Even though I wouldn&#039;t describe this substance as mind-expanding, it does allow you to dive deeper in to art. Six hours in to the experience my flatmate put on &quot;Freaks and geeks&quot; pilot in the living room after cooking something delicious and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been so /in/ to whatever I&#039;m watching. It may be correct that the trip is pretty much over at the 8 hour mark, but there are lingering effects, in particular I find it hard to catch sleep well beyond that, so duration-wise I&#039;d put it in the same category as LSD. <br /><br />I&#039;m a little puzzled by all these descriptions of the introspective properties, that hasn&#039;t been my experience. In fact for me it wasn&#039;t enjoyable until I interacted with other people or found something creative to do. I should also mention that I&#039;ve been noticing HPPD symptoms after these experiments. It started with catching floaters in the eye more often and as I researched HPPD more I&#039;ve also noticed &quot;visual snow&quot; on dark surfaces. This is not something I&#039;m very concerned about, and I generally notice it more when I work out, something that I started to do regularly during that month. As with floaters there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;re just noticing something that has always been there. Just thought I&#039;d mention it.<br /><br />Somehow I doubt this will become the LSD of our generation, but I&#039;m no good at population predictions.

				Hmm, maybe has something to do with the specific tabs you have because during all my 25i experiences I have REALLY been tripping, tons of visuals etc...

				I recently had a wild trip on 1 tab of 25C-NBOMe, in combination with being silly high on some mids. To be concise, I had my ass handed to me. I never get the insane visuals that I read about in other people&#039;s trip reports; everything is always just amplified, and I do notice some patterns/distortions when I focus/concentrate. But, boy, did I get a mental ass-kicking of a lifetime from this trip -- must have been the combination, because I would have never gotten to this level with just 1 tab. I was having auditory hallucinations, irrational thought patterns, frequent bouts of pessimism and confusion, lucid dreams, and what appeared to be abductions (alien?) of some sort. In the end, I prevailed, but I definitely received an important message, I believe, and that was to not treat these substances as recreational drugs, which I figured was my hidden intention prior to the trip.<br /><br />You know, I sometimes wonder whether there truly is any substantial difference between the 25x-NBOMe experience and the LSD experience. Both are agonists for the 5HT2A receptor, which leads me to believe they&#039;re not that different pharmacodynamically. Now, obviously they&#039;re not of the same composition, and there are subtle differences in terms of effects, particularly the physical effects of 25x-NBOMe. However, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any justification for the belief/claim that LSD provides a more natural/spiritual experience. This could be another topic in itself.

				I&#039;ve only tried 25D properly with MDMA...<br />1st time - Dropped one tab at my mates house, taste isn&#039;t that bad at all. I remember feeling pleasant and getting slight visuals, was not noticeably intoxicated, could function normally.<br />2nd time - Two other mates and I double dropped an hour after doing two 100mg MDMA pills. About 30/45 minutes later, effects were miniscule but our stomachs felt awful and soon after I was spewing my dinner all over the garden. I felt fine after this, not sure if I put the tabs back in my mouth though! The visuals increased greatly over the next 2 hours and the bodyload was perfect. I would attribute this to the pills however!<br /><br />Sorry for the poor review, it was some time ago but I reckon it should be tried, the more the merrier!

				Here&#039;s another case.<br /><br />This person normally doses around ten hits (10mg). While I can&#039;t begin to explain the many different stories he&#039;s told me, I will say that he is an extremely experienced experimenter. I just wanted to add this to inform people that this high of dosage has been taken, and survived, without trauma. Again, this person is EXTREMELY experienced. I would not recommend anyone take this dose, especially someone not fully aware of how the mind and body work.<br /><br />On a side note, how do I have +1/-1 karma after only one post? Who would give me negative karma for that?
