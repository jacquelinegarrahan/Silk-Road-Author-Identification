				I&#039;m new to the forums. Long time reader, first time poster.<br />I recently got 2 grams of &quot;shrooms&quot; from a friend for a birthday present. The exact strain is Psilocybe Cyanenscens, which I&#039;ve researched, and been told is one of the more potent strains. I have smoked cannabis and a a form of spice that has given me a really intense body high, and an amphetamine like feeling. I&#039;ve also experimented with pills from friends, mostly pain killers. I won&#039;t go into that, but I am around 5&#039;6. I weigh about 140 lbs, and have zero experience with psychedelics. <br /><br />Take note that I only listed the spice, to let you know I have had intense body highs before, although I did not enjoy it at all. I do not drink caffeine. At all, for the sheer fact I don&#039;t touch any stimulants.<br /><br />Based on all the information above, what would you suggest I do before hand to feel more safe and better for the trip? Should I eat before hand, what to have on hand, people or nobody, etc. Any input is appreciated.

				One word - benzodiazepines.<br /><br />Can take the edge of a scary trip and make you feel much better if things go a bit *too* strange. <br /><br />Just trip with people you know and like - have a look at Leary&#039;s &#039;set &amp; setting&#039; - google it. About being in the right mindframe etc.<br /><br />Have fun! You will feel newborn the morning after. An incredible experience. Don&#039;t stress too much ;)

				Many thanks! My friend told me to remember to use benzos as well, which would really help me calm down from a bad time. I&#039;ll look into them, but I have no real experience with them at all.<br /><br />Anybody have any ideas on dosage? Just to be safe, starting dosages for first timers? I&#039;d easily go to erowid and read reports, but I feel like I can talk to people in a more &quot;face to face&quot; type deal on this, so it would be better to get some more input on that!

				Never heard of that strain and possibly have no idea what I&#039;m talking about, but I would eat the 2 grams all at once if I were you.

				Sure, having benzos on hand could be helpful, but don&#039;t worry and fret about the possibility of a bad trip.&nbsp; They say &quot;you are what you eat,&quot; I say, &quot;You are what you think.&quot;&nbsp; If you have a negative outlook on it, it can create a bad trip.&nbsp; Nothing in a psychedelic trip comes out of the blue, it&#039;s all in your mind or the way you are interpreting things in realtime.&nbsp; Convince yourself it will be awesome, and it will be.<br />Trust me... it WILL BE a blast.<br /><br />I too would eat all 2g of the shrooms... but then again, personally, I&#039;d eat the 2g and then say, &quot;Anyone got another 3gs I can down?&quot;

				Mushrooms are very safe physiologically so there&#039;s no real &#039;safe dose&#039;, 2g of cyans is a good dose for a beginner though. I&#039;d advise against benzos for trip abortion, they don&#039;t tone down the weirdness but they do dull your mind so you end up feeling all confused and unable to work through any difficult parts of the trip.<br />

				fast the day of, smoke weed if you feel nervous. remember: set and setting are the most important things. there are no &quot;bad trips.&quot; that is just an attempt to paint the psychedelic experience black and white; it is beyond shades, beyond color. read this to better understand the psychedelic state: http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/psychedelic_experience/psychedelic_experience.shtml<br /><br />welcome to reality, brother.

				Hey Cuddles<br /><br />Well I used to do tons of shrooms back in the day, nowadays its a once in a while thing, I would suggest being outdoors in a nice nature setting if at all possible, be with good friend(s), and for me a little herb always helped with the come down, and extends the trip a bit.. my first time was unexpected so I had little time to start wondering or second guessing so-to speak.. just take the trip as it comes ;)..<br /><br />Cheers<br />

				Have warm milk handy (settles the stomach). A comfy throw blanket is useful. Have a stretching routine. Go through it 3-4 times sober before you dose (assuming it is not your regular thing). Establish a breathing pattern... count 1-2-3 on your inhale.. hold for 1-2-, exhale for 1-2-3-4-5. This helps relax you physiologically and sinks your qi. If you have experience with yoga or qigong keep your tongue up as much as you can.<br /><br />&nbsp;Focus on your hands and feet. There is a place in them where the heat is. Find it and breathe through it. It will beat with good music if you let it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Your yinting/6th chakra/third eye is a place that is highly active on psychedelics. Don&#039;t worry if you have alot of activity there.. it&#039;s perfectly natural and will fade as you come down.<br /><br />Remember your breathing pattern and definitely follow the earlier poster&#039;s advice about fasting the day prior. Fasting plus some milk to settle the stomach just after eating the mushies is a good protocall.<br /><br />&nbsp;Be well and may you be jubilant and humbled in the light of the Mushroom Goddess!
