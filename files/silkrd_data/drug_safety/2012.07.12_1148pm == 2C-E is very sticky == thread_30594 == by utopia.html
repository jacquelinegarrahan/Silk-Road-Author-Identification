				After obtaining some 2C-E I have realised that it is a very hard substance to get dosage right. I have a mg scale that seems to be pretty accurate - this is not so much the problem. The problem is that 2C-E is very sticky and the baggies i have it in are fucking massive (A5/250mg whoever thought that was a good idea is a moron) - this makes it very hard to get onto the scale and obtain a healthy dosage. I&#039;ve tried eyeballing snorted dosages a couple of times and underestimated the required amount (fortunately i guess...). So anybody got any good ideas about how to get it into the scales without it sticking to my hands, my credit card etc. and then to get it out again so that i have an accurateish dose? Keen to try a proper yet safe 2c-e dose caus its supposed to be pretty cool. Have a feeling this sticky/clumpy aspect is similar to most 2c-* so any advice?

				I&#039;ve never had any sticky 2c-x compounds... <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding you? Sometimes when I&#039;m measuring stuff out, the 2c-x&#039;s in particular will leave a little residue on the weighing pan. But I wouldn&#039;t call it sticky - that seems to imply wet or oily?

				I use the small pocket knife on my baby Leatherman Multi-Tool, but I know what you mean. 2C-E is super fluffy, almost wet-like. Somewhat of a difficult substance to work with but it&#039;s worth it when you get it right. ^-^

				Dissolve the 2c-e and then measure out doses volumetrically? One risk is how to determine the concentration of this liquid when you can&#039;t be absolutely sure that there is 250mg of 2c-e in there and not over/underweight. Ask the vendor what their empty bag of that size weighs?<br /><br />Weigh bag. Write down this weight.<br />Dissolve 2c-e in a known weight of a somewhat volatile solvent that you can use to volumetrically dose with.<br />Try to get out as much solvent as you can from the bag.<br />Does the dried empty bag weigh 250mg or so less than when you started? If so, great.<br />As a double check, is your weight of solvent &lt;=250mg more than when you started? If it weighs &gt;250mg more, you&#039;ve got a problem.<br /><br />You could evaporate the solvent out, but then you&#039;re going to end up having to scrape the 2c-e off your watch glass or whatever you choose, and when you&#039;re dealing with 250mg, you&#039;re going to lose a good chunk of your stuff.<br /><br />Carefully choose a solvent that doesn&#039;t dissolve your baggie of course.<br />Make sure solvent is consumption-grade if you&#039;re going to consume it directly instead of evaporate it away.<br />Proper labeling and child-proofing of your active 2c-e liquid is crucial. Consider a locked box for this kind of thing.<br />Make sure solvent is reasonably pure and doesn&#039;t contain crap that doesn&#039;t evaporate (put a drop on a horizontal mirror, come back in a while, is it completely gone, or did it leave a residue?)

				I always use a drinking straw from a fast food joint. I cut the end into an angle of about 45 degrees. Then you can just use that as a scoop and scrape off the compounds into capsules.<br /><br />And yeah, I know what you mean about 2C-E being a little sticky.

				yeh those drinking straw/knife ideas seem to be good way to go thanks :) <br /><br />Interested in the solvent idea too. In theory could I dissolve in a known quality of water then just drink some of that water? My only problem with this is I&#039;m not sure how much of a grasp on basic chemistry I hold. If I dissolved 500mg of a substance in, say, 2 litres of water (a bottle) would there be a constant amount of substance per every x ml (assuming the substance is completely dissolved)? I know that that&#039;s a lot of solvent for the tiny amount of substance but it would make it easier to measure and easier to take.

				If you buy a set of weighing spoons, the smallest one can often fit inside a 0-sized capsule. Thats what I use and it&#039;s the bee&#039;s knees!

Use everclear if you can instead of water, it dissolves things better and has less water and less risk of inadvertent mass consumption)<br />3) How safe/toxic is the solvent? For some applications, you might use acetone as your solvent, but you&#039;d want to evaporate it away before drinking it of course.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30594.msg343053#msg343053">Quote from: utopia on July 13, 2012, 03:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My only problem with this is I&#039;m not sure how much of a grasp on basic chemistry I hold.

For most substances, you should be able to find a reference somewhere on the internet that states its solubility. If you can&#039;t, well, you can do a test yourself by seeing when the crystals disappear (and then adding more solvent to be safe), but who knows how stable it will be. Most psychoactive drugs will be at least somewhat soluble in distilled water, and by extension, alcohols. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30594.msg343053#msg343053">Quote from: utopia on July 13, 2012, 03:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know that that&#039;s a lot of solvent for the tiny amount of substance but it would make it easier to measure and easier to take.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s fine, just be sure to properly label and safely store your compound out of reach of those who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. Consider adding some food coloring drops to help ensure that people don&#039;t think it&#039;s water if they still manage to somehow come across it.

				Lab spatula sounds like your soloution.<br /><br />I found it pretty easy to gently tap the bag/vial(which I use for ALL substances) and dump it out mg by mg. Just takes patience. When I was a kiddie, I did 100 10mg 2c-e pills by hand using this method. Just scraped it off the measuring dish with a gel cap to make sure I got everything.

Going to do some calculations and see if i can get one dose to be a shot glass - doing colourful shots of psychedelic water sounds like a nice way to do things ;) thanks for ya help
