				Hey people&#039;s :) <br />it&#039;s SpeedCrunch with yet another trip report. This time with 280-300ug of ConciseSupply&#039;s LSD rated @ 70-90ug per tab (Took 4x tabs) with the goal of trying to understand God and myself.<br /><br />Needless to say I did not discover the secrets of the universe but I did end up at one point getting crushed by the Sydney Opera House and having a conversation with my alter ego......So yeah it was at the very least an interesting experience.<br /><br />But with all that said am still trying to find that deep mystical and spiritual experience that I just cant seem to find. (Any advice on finding this would be greatly appreciated)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Personal notes:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">--------------------------------------<br />Personal notes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />--------------------------------------<br />Pre-notes 23/6/2012 -- Private notes<br /><br />At some point today I intend to ingest by my calculations 4x 70µg (purple lotus flower blotter) of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) = 280µg<br /><br />I&#039;ve been asking myself lately why...What has driven me to experiment on myself with psychedelic drugs.<br /><br />In the beginning of my journey I just wanted to see cool looking visuals and trip and escape reality.....aka party like a stupid dumb ass....but along the way in the middle of all the LSD and 2C-B experiments I have found something more.......something that transcends definition....challenges the very thought of what we think of as a reality. (mystical experience?)<br /><br />But yet I don&#039;t truly understand what it is.....Are psychedelics a gateway to staring at the face of God and understanding the creation of man and understanding oneself. Can you break down the gates of heaven? I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />LSD for me has personality challenged the very concept of a reality and even the existence of a God. (I just want to add a personal note that I consider myself religious I believe that there is something out there that in essence could be considered a God but yet I don&#039;t go shouting the lord&#039;s word in the middle of town like a fanatic) But since using LSD I no longer have faith/believe in organized religion it&#039;s just a lie I see it as people who pose as priests and saints with the only goal of money and power over people.<br /><br />Sorry I keep rambling on about my personal beliefs/opinions...To be honest I don&#039;t even know if am going to post this on the SilkRoad forums as this is all very personal to me. but I need to type out my feelings I need to know where am going and how/what psychedelic can show me.<br /><br />I want to understand myself and God if there is such a thing....There is something out there but weather or not it could be considered a God is debatable....<br /><br />As you may have noticed am I&#039;m experiencing a bit of a loss/crisis in terms of my spirituality. (Sometimes I envy atheists) But yet I cant understand how someone can&#039;t believe in a God.<br /><br />But anyway it&#039;s my hope that psychedelics may provide an answer to what am seeking. I have tried LSD and 2C-B and out of the 2 compounds I have tried I have only found LSD to be useful in terms of mystical experience and mind expansion. While with 2C-B I have found is more of a party drug with very little spiritual depth.(Might be good for sex though)<br /><br />As well as using LSD I intend to use at some point Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) But I have yet to find anyone who sells them in the UK and there is no way in hell I&#039;m going to order mushrooms international.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know but I will say that this will be my last trip for a while at least 2 months. I been using LSD a lot lately and at times I fell like am becoming a schizophrenic madman.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t know I guess I will see what happens after my trip. But with that said if I do go super crazy I got diazepam and Xanax about 130+ pills on hand in total lmao.........But no worries I wont OD I have to much to live for and I love life even if am an LSD induced schizophrenic madman trying to understand the face of God and the creation of mankind<br /><br /><br /><br />Depending on the outcome of my trip I may or may not post this log on the forums:<br /><br />But if I do I would like to here your opinions on life and the nature of humanity and the possibility of a God. It might make for a good discussion. Also I would like to know how psychedelics have helped other people and how it has changed you for better or worse.<br /><br />But anyway I&#039;m going to listen to some music lift my mood watch some Futurama and then take some LSD and venture into the unknown recesses of my mind like a true Psychonaut.<br /><br />Psychonautics what a truly fascinating word this will be LSD trip #11 + about 8 or so 2C-B trips but yet I fell as though I have barely scratched the surface of my mind.....life what an interesting cycle life/death/rebirth</code><br />Trip preparation:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Trip LOG 23/6/2012 23:30 - Date will be 24/6/2012 when I start my trip.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />23:34 I need to plan some shit out. Get extra glasses of water in my room get food get things ready so I don&#039;t have to do anything complicated latter on. There is nothing worse then 3-4 hours in your trip then your hungry and have to cook something.....I should note that I&#039;m tripping alone a friend would be nice but I do enjoy analyzing myself alone.<br /><br />23:55 in the middle of watching the documentary Ecstasy Bandits and I must say Alexander Shulgin is just amazing he makes me wish I had become a scientist rather than the computer expert/technician that I am.<br /><br />00:36 I just realized after watching Ecstasy Bandits that no amount of psychedelics will ever give me an absolute answer to the meaning of life and existence....But it may allow me to explore parts of my existence/Consciousness that I never knew existed.</code><br />TRIP LOG:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Now the Trip Starts------Sorry for the delay----I know some people don&#039;t like reading -<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />02:00 Took 4x 70µg (purple lotus flower blotter) = 280µg<br /><br />02:03 Now the question is what will I find (There&#039;s a lot rattling around up there in my mind....You know....flying penguins and all)<br /><br />02:11 I just want to add as with any LSD trip anything can happen. If my trip gets rough or if it gets to hard to focus I may stop logging for the duration of the trip. I like to make my logs in real time as I experience things so it&#039;s fresh in my mind but if it becomes impossible I will write the rest of the log from memory after my trip.<br /><br />02:15 listening to The Beatles&nbsp; Stereo Box Set (16 CD) (The Beatles just give me a great sense of relaxation and peace) + I just put on some cool socks....When on LSD rubbing your feet on the floor with socks on is just an amazing experience. The feel of your feet on the floor is awesome!<br /><br />02:25 shit that was quick I can fell the onset. erowid does list Onset 20 - 60 mins-- But Whoa fast onset is it /set/setting? half empty stomach? The world will never know lmao<br />[NOTE] http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_effects.shtml&nbsp; &nbsp;[Good source of information] [Always research your shit always.....or you will pay]<br /><br />2:42 Additional note very fast come-up Update! put simply music is the divination of the gods! the beatles. Are just Gods of a golden age......at one with the world<br /><br />2:43 P.S I like to sit back listen to music for about 2 hours to gauge all the effects then start some serious exploration when I hit my peak...If that makes any sense...<br /><br />2:50 Just to update very deep relaxation.....Like sedation like I&#039;m going to drift into never-land filled with extra pixie dust<br /><br />2:51 slight light visuals 51 minutes in lol.....I have never had a trip come on so fast..But I have never swallowed 4 tabs before lmao<br /><br />2:54 Looks like CuisineSupply is getting another +1 from me on the forums <br />55 minutes in with 11+ hours to go LSD that true mellow yellow (It can send you to Heaven or hell Or if you push the panic button it will send you to A&amp;E<br /><br />2:59 RULE#1 NEVER EVER PUSH THE PANIC BUTTON....aka don&#039;t freak out like a noob&nbsp; &nbsp;(If you don&#039;t get the panic button joke/reference then watch yellow submarine.......just not on lsd....)<br /><br />03:06 Whoa a lot of random thoughts from CEV&#039;s of bender from futurama and former vice president al gore wearing a cape and flying around......and now it&#039;s all blank-- not fucking joking. Just closed eye visuals.<br /><br />3:09 I should just shut the fuck up and listen to the beatles and less logging.....except I like logging but at the same time it interferes with the trip..But I like to keep my logs fresh in memory.<br /><br />3:09 I don&#039;t know if I do my logs for myself just as some retarded reference to keep me sane.......Or it could be possible that I log to help other users. Yeah<br /><br />3:17 I want people to understand lsd and at the same time I want to learn more about lsd and life.....<br />So if anything at all can be gained from my logs then the slight inconvenience of typing while under the influence lsd..no matter how much my log may piss me off............it&#039;s all worth it in the end...........<br />I hope some young and old people learn from my logs.......also I want to add am 28+ of age so not a stupid young kid just some guy trying to understand life and humanity via psychedelics......What a life goal ha<br /><br />3:23 The text in my log is waving only 80 min in I have visuals fast thought patterns but a surprisingly clear head-space....No headfuck.....<br />But to be honest I only experience headfuck when dealing with difficult metal issues...Or watch a fucked up movie like the beatles yellow submarine movie..Don&#039;t watch yellow submarine on lsd unless you have balls of golden steal.....that&#039;s all I will say on yellow submarine lol.<br /><br />03:24 The beatles music on LSD is fucking awesome......But there movies can make you push the panic button lol<br /><br />3:25 right I have no idea what the fuck am on about or how I can even type so am going to try to shut the fuck up and listen the The Beatles&nbsp; Stereo Box Set (16 CD)&nbsp; P.S love all you guys @ SilkRoad<br /><br />3:30 I just want to add trip toys are your best friends!!! I got some trippy peace beads!! oh YES! so much color.peace love joy no war....no whiskey drinking generals giving orders<br /><br />3:40 right now for some real reporting smooth visuals...evaluated visuals more smooth with very little tracers....Will update in 20 minhmmm make that 40 min.<br /><br />3:58 Just finished watching the after movie for Defqon.1 Festival Australia 2011 - Official Movie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7r8OiDrew<br /><br />I have a complete feeling of ecstasy!!!!!!! everything is 100% except I cant find that...............spiritual stuff.......Hmmm should I try magic mushrooms?<br /><br />4:01 fuck it at any rate am having a blast lets just hope it gets more insightful.<br /><br />4:04 Why do we have to kill each other? Why cant we all live in peace? Is the world not large enough? What&#039;s the point of War? people die that&#039;s serious shit.(I just want to add am Pro war when sober but with lsd I see it differently)<br /><br />04:08 You know the solution to world peace is lsd If every world leader where forced to take a 300µg lsd dose with beatles music per election term.<br /><br />4:11 I wonder if governments fear lsd because it shows you the true face of humanity. It&#039;s all love peace calm no need for fear or panic.<br /><br />4:14 We shouldn&#039;t fear people because there different. We should should learn from them and in exchange they learn from us and the world gets better.<br /><br />4:16 Is it just crazy nonsense...Or is it possible.........Will humanity be united or will they destroy one another filled with hate and agendas.........sigh I hope I don&#039;t live to see that day.<br /><br />4:20 But whatever. Time to move on to other thoughts.<br /><br />4:26 I just want to add it&#039;s odd I wanted this trip to be a deep spiritual trip to find myself but yet I find myself in color and ecstasy! Don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s nice and all but I would like a spiritual experience....hmmm going to try magic mushrooms or DMT. But at any-rate am going to enjoy my trip and have a blast lol....<br /><br />4:29 It&#039;s so fucking odd you never know where lsd will take you........Heaven.....Hell............A&amp;E?.....But lucky for me it&#039;s heavenly bliss.<br /><br />4:37 I think I have found the right dosage about 280-300µg provides desired effects + I believe that this is strongly dependent on set/setting. I bet I could do this dose 100 times and have 100+ different experiences each time.<br /><br />4:41 From my calculations if there correct bear in mind I&#039;m on LSD I should have about 8-9 hours left on my trip with that said am going to log off this log for a bit and search for that spiritual experience that I been looking for...wish me luck<br /><br />4:46 light that beautiful light of morning! I love that look in the sky,,,,going to end log for now<br /><br />5:10 something new and I have never experienced on lsd. I just had a serious conversation with my Alter ego(in my head) like another me but different........How strange...lol?<br /><br />5:10 If I didn&#039;t know any better I would say I might be crazy......lol.........I just don&#039;t know........Yeah going to listen to more beatles<br /><br />5:18 was staring out the window then I started getting a sense of fear and panic.....But I got up and picked up my peace beads and now am as calm as can be lmao...Strange what a little toy can do......but they are cool peace beads..P.S logging pisses me off<br /><br />5:22 Simple UPDATE! A reese&#039;s peanut butter cup tastes sooo good on lsd at 5 in the morning..........nothing like it.<br /><br />5:41 I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed to log this. I I really really didn&#039;t........But I thought about my log and anyone who may read it someday...so yeah worth reporting I just experienced simultaneous emotions <br />Joy,Love,Hate,greed,Hope,desire and a shit load of other stuff in one emotion at the same time.<br /><br />5:45 I just realized I might be high......I should give this some more thought.or not...<br /><br />5:47 Should I even log this shit anymore? does anyone care...........I don&#039;t know fuck it...Going to stop this log take a piss and look out on my back garden the sun has come up and it&#039;s beautiful<br /><br />5:53 I saw something so beautiful it made my cry. http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=Hzgzim5m7oU&amp;vq=medium<br /><br />5:54 I thank God for being alive I love the cycle of life........even if I still don&#039;t understand what God is.......and yet I fell like am at square one where I started.....hmmmm well only 4 hours in lol who knows what will happen.<br /><br />5:56 the one thing I love about LSD is time is almost forever I love the snail&#039;s pace of time....So slow so much to experience if only it could slow down even more<br /><br />6:13 Still high with visuals But I strangely feel in control with no headfuck like i can go wherever I want to go. At times I forget am having a trip. It&#039;s like I can direct where my trip is going like herding sheep. This is cool!<br /><br />6:21 it&#039;s funny I feel calm and at complete peace with myself....Hmmm to top off this moment of cressy happiness..........I think a will watch a Disney/pixar film...Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure1080p..<br /><br />6:40 right as with most things lsd I got bored and found myself staring at random desktop HD wallpapers and listening to the beatles again....I swear LSD turns you into a child...I feel like a new born baby.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />6:46 My last log for the day. :Closing comments 280-300µg is the range that am aiming for (more testing required) I would like to go 350µg hmm only time and a lot of trial and error will tell.<br /><br />The only issue is finding accurately dosed blotter although CuisineSupply tabs seem to be accurately dosed.hmmmm More trial and error P.S still seeing visuals and pupils are the size of flying saucers. But am tired of logging Good Bye<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />14:00 I woke up at about 12:30 I must of slept for a good 4 hours had very vivid dreams that felt very real to my body....In one vision I saw the Sydney opera house and it feel on top of me I swear i could feel the pain of being crushed and then my dream shifted to various other places and colors. The dreaming was all very turbulent like rough seas but it was all very calming except for almost getting crushed by the Sydney opera house I have no idea what the fuck that was all about.....I think it was The Sydney opera house...I think I should just leave this entry as that........I don&#039;t know what else to add..<br /><br />14:06 also wanted to add that at about 12:30 I still had very slight visuals and minor pupil dilation.<br /><br />14:07 As of 14:07 visual effects are gone but the mild residual mind altering effects are still there. e.g I feel at peace with myself and others and I can see the flow of life.<br /><br />14:10 I originally set out to find a spiritual experience on this trip.....But as with anything lsd I just don&#039;t know a trip is a different experience every time. This trip is not what I expected but it wasn&#039;t disappointing either.....I can&#039;t seem to direct trips they just take me places.<br /><br />14:14 It&#039;s strange I don&#039;t know if I learned anything from this trip it was fun but I just don&#039;t know. I think I need time to process it all.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />END OF LOG: 24/6/2012&nbsp; &nbsp;14:17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</code>

That&#039;s pretty awesome !

I&#039;m in Canada and they are not many local sellers for the psychedelics i love (LSD, 25I) Anarcho47 is a good Canadian LSD seller but he doesn&#039;t sent domestically for security reasons, he is a seller here for one year you can try his stuff too&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yeah I might order international again but when things go wrong and a package goes missing the stress is just to much always wondering if the police are going to knock down your door. (It&#039;s enough to drive you mad)<br /><br />I feel much more safer buying domestic. ConciseSupply sells some good LSD for the UK market but I do agree I could be stronger. As juergen&#039;s LSD has always landed me on my ass with just one tab but in a good way :)<br /><br />With that said though I have nothing against&nbsp; ConciseSupply&#039;s lsd it&#039;s all been a nice ride. I got 3 tabs left I just hope he gets some stronger tabs in the future.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will getting stronger tabs soon, within 2 weeks, and weed at under 90$ a quarter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That sound&#039;s excellent do you have any idea of the strength of the tabs you will be getting? Would be nice to have accurately dosed 150ug and 250ug tabs.
