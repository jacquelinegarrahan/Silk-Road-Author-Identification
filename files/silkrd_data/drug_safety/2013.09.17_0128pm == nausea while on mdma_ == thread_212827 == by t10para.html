				OK, So firstly i am fairly new to taking MDMA (done it about 3 or 4 times).<br />every time i have taken it, it has been in capsules (100mg each) and every time i take it i feel like yacking and im only just able to keep it down.<br />the other night i over packed the caps a little (~120mg) and ended up yacking in a nightclub after my first one.<br /><br />so i was wondering if there was something that i could take to prevent me from nausea while bombing MDMA? or will even snorting it prevent me from yacking?<br /><br />Ive read somewhere that ginger is quite good for it but wasn&#039;t sure if someone was just trolling :/<br /><br />thanks if anyone can give me any tips or home remedies that can help me keep my stomach under control. :)

				The heaving feeling your getting is indicative of your bodies ceiling for mdma. Its what happens when you blow up. Try lightening the dose a bit, or just go with it. The heaves means youve done enough.

				This is fairly common and from experience I believe snorting makes it worse, drinking alcohol as well.

				i got told that 1.7mg of mdma per kg of body weight is what you can handle. im ~90kg and almost yacking at 100mg.<br /><br />but can anyone confirm that ginger works to calm the stomach?

				I doubt it, maybe a bit but MDMA would probably over power ginger, I might be wrong now. Maybe try dosing a little bit at a time, 25 mg every 15 minutes for an hour so it will be more of a smooth and gradual come up.

				Remember, serotonin is largely used to regulate the &#039;nausea&#039; feeling. It may be very well that this is a sign of a slight overdose in terms of your body chemistry. You may try weed or some type of anti-mimetic (e.g. motion sickness drugs) in conjunction to mitigate such symptoms. However, if you notice a wide range of other symptoms related to serotonin syndrome, please stop.

				My ex-gf and I popped 2 high-dose mdma pills each about 3 or 4 years back. She puked her guts out and I was extremely hot/cold and sweating my balls off, on the verge of puking. It generally means you overdid it. It should reside after a half hour to an hour though, then your back feeling fantastic.
