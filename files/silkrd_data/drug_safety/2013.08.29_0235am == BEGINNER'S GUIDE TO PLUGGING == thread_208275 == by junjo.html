				Hello all, just thought I&#039;d share this since a lot of people on here seem quite interested in the idea of plugging, but are afraid to try it/have no idea where to start.<br />I originally typed this guide for plugging heroin (probably the most practical application of plugging, since most other drugs have decent ROAs elsewhere), but you can swap heroin for pretty much any other water soluble drug in existence.<br />I was quite appalled by the idea of shoving a tube into my ass at first, but it&#039;s actually very easy and so much nicer than snorting. Can&#039;t speak for IVing since I&#039;m terrified of needles though.<br /><br />Basically, I use a 5 mL plastic medicine dropper (kinda looks like a miniature turkey baster) that i bought from walgreens for a whopping 3 bucks<br />(link to said dropper: http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-medicine-dropper-and-spoon/ID=prod6001630-product)<br /><br />I take my H (this works with tar or #4) and swish it back and forth in 5 mLs of warm water in the dropper until it is completely dissolved<br /><br />Next (the most important part), cover the syringe in lotion or lube, whatever you&#039;ve got lyring around, as it makes the next step WAY easier<br /><br />Now, insert the dropper full of your Heroin/Water solution slowly into you-know-where, wiggling it back and forth, until you&#039;re sure it&#039;s about 4-5 inches deep.<br />(Trust me, the 4-5 inches sounds bad, but with enough lube, it just slides right in. I have never experienced ANY pain whatsoever during the plugging process)<br /><br />Lay down on your stomach so the bulb is upright, and squeeze all the contents out, holding the bulb down so you don&#039;t accidentally suck the liquid back in<br />Hold this in place for about 30 seconds, then slowly maneuver the dropper out and put it on a paper towel to your side<br />Continue to lay down for 10-20 minutes to let the H completely absorb, and feel the wonderful rush of it without ever having to touch a needle.<br />Once you&#039;re feeling it, feel free to get up, as it&#039;s not going to come spilling out your ass.<br /><br />And there ya go, that&#039;s how to plug heroin.<br /><br />Make sure to sanitize the syringe with rubbing alcohol and soapy water after each use (even though it&#039;s really not too concerning, considering it&#039;s your own bacteria you&#039;re dealing with).<br />And that&#039;s pretty much all there i too it.<br />If you do it right (LUBE, LUBE, LUBE!), it&#039;s completely painless, miles safer than shooting up, and gives you a slow, but pronounced rush that&#039;s far better than snorting.<br /><br />Feel free to drop me a question if you&#039;d like to know more.<br />Happy nodding/tripping/rolling/whatever else you want to use this for!<br /><br />PS: Keep in mind that your plugging dose may be significantly lower than your normal dose since rectal ROA is generally quite high. Always start off small and work your way up!

				Interesting read. Do you think its more of a mental thing sticking something up your butt? It seems like a good RoA, but I really don&#039;t like the idea of stuff going up my butt.

				Hi junjo, nice info. I&#039;ve found that the best/most comfortable positions for plugging are laying on your side with one leg extended (the closest to the floor) and the other leg bent, or get on all fours and slowly lower your shoulders so they touch the floor and your ass stays up in the air.

The more you relax beforehand, the better it works. As I said before, I&#039;ve never had any pain associated with this ROA. Sounds a hell lot better than stuffing a needle into yourself anywhere

I always do the insertion step standing up, as it seems to go in a lot easier that way. Once it&#039;s all the way in and not going anywhere, I lay down on my stomach and squeeze everything in. That step is purely a matter of personal preference though, as long as you don&#039;t do something stupid enough to tear a hole in your rectum&nbsp; :-\

				Gotcha. The only thing about the positions I mentioned is that they naturally allow your body to relax so you can let the drugs kick in. I actually learned them from someone more experienced in plugging. Try them out, you&#039;ll thank me later.

				Mental hurdles to injecting and snorting and not having much experience with smoking have prevented me from trying a few substances on my list. I should look up whether K or DMT can be plugged and maybe give this some thought.

				Yes... they can be. K is fairly easy to do. Just got to have somebody there for bigger doses. you dont want to slip away with a needle in your vene. <br /><br />DMT is working too. but i am not sure how to do it. Eg. how to solve the power in alc or whatever.<br /><br />if you find something on that, please post it here.

Or use very little alcohol/dilute it with additional water if the substance has to be in alcohol.<br />And start off with a small dose because it will kick in way more heavy promise me. <br />Also you will get MAJOR drunk when you insert to much alcohol. ;-)<br />

				Let me go ahead and say that I&#039;ve ALWAYS had a stigma about plugging.<br />Then again I&#039;ve always hated needles.<br />After trying this method last night, I really don&#039;t see any reason to main line anything.<br />Absolutely no discomfort, onset was exactly as described.<br />8-15mg of powder was MORE than enough, and it knocked me out for 12 hours and I finally got some sleep.<br />Thank god, and I&#039;d do this in the future with anything else that has shitty oral or nasal bio-availability.<br />Snorting is more expensive, and really the only advantage I see is convenience or when you&#039;re on the go.<br />If you are at home, this is the method you absolutely want to use.<br /><br />Thank you Junjo!

Water soluble DMT.<br /><br />*Any acetone you have bought will contain some traces of water, even those you get from fine chemical suppliers.&nbsp; To get rid of the water, heat some magnesium sulfate(epsom salts) in the oven at 200-250*C for about 3-4 hours, then pound the shit out of it with heavy implement of your choice until its nice and powdery.&nbsp; Add a substantial amount to the container of acetone, cap it, and shake it for 5 minutes every hour or so for 3-4 hours.&nbsp; Pour off the acetone into a separate container.&nbsp; Do not leave the magnesium sulfate in with the acetone.
