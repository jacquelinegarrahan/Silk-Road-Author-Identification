				What dosages are recommended for trying 4-FA?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know, I&#039;m fucking sick of MDPV that shit is crazy.<br /><br />Is it a good sex drug? I love sex drugs.

				Honestly, I use it but not recreationally so this might not be a lot of help to you.&nbsp; <br /><br />The average recreational dosage is about 150mg from what I understand.&nbsp; Look it up on Erowid.<br /><br />I use it at ~10-20mg.&nbsp; I just get a little more energy for the day and more motivation.&nbsp; It works WELL. :)

				Sounds good, I was going to use it dump my thoughts into my journal. I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t think of Erowid, I&#039;ll go have a look there.

				I took .25 and it was crazy, the empatogen effect gone and it was only energy and energy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend to take this much, my dick was dead and my brain could not stop thinking. Maybe .15 it&#039;s good, the rc seemed good, but I don&#039;t think that it is a good sex drug.<br />I am sure you can have good sex with it, but it would be like on amphetamine sulfate, maybe a little better.

				Also take into account your weight, if under 100kg<br /><br />try perhaps 0.1..<br /><br />Above mentioned 0.15 isnt bad idea neither.

				Sorry, realized we can talk about different ROA.<br /><br />I always IV if possible.. if not, you should be pretty safe with 0.15<br /><br />Update: 4-FA is very IVable, much like amphetamine

				I have NO experience with IV, I don&#039;t ever plan to, but thanks for the info.&nbsp; Always looking to expand my knowledge. :)&nbsp; <br /><br />For the record, I was referring to oral dosage.&nbsp; Everything I&#039;ve read says don&#039;t insufflated it.&nbsp; Decreased effects(due to a lower bio availability) and A LOT of pain.

				I had a really good time with about 170mg, not to bad when I used all 250mg. The entactogenic effects are really weird. I was surprisingly slow in thought. Porn was awesome.
