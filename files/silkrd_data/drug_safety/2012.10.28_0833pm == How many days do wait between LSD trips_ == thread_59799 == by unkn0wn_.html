				My LSD order of 20 tabs is coming soon, I&#039;ve yet to try it and I&#039;m curious how frequently people dose on acid?<br /><br />I bought an entheogenic book about LSD trips and it recommended to space them out by a month. But this was advice for non-recreational use.<br /><br />Any advice?

				Sorta depends on the dosage. If you&#039;re really tripping hard each time then I&#039;d wait at least a month in between trips.

				I think its a minimum of 5 days, 7 being better. Honestly, that chemical is special. Don&#039;t waste it, spread it out and reflect on the entire trip. Integrate what you learned into your life. Cherish this heavenly substance :) Respect the drug, if you take it just for kicks frequently, the drug will lose its magic. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s honestly not the kind of drug that you even think about doing every week. The insights you get from being in that mindset last a long time, and doing it too frequently can often cheapen the experience. <br /><br />Not quite like MDMA where the actual effects are weaker, but more of a psychological thing. This is all based off anecdotal evidence of course so take it with a grain of salt.

				I like to keep my trips few and far between. Maybe every couple of months is my norm. That way, I appreciate them more when they do happen :)<br /><br />I tend to trip more often during the Summer though, with music festivals being on.

By day 5 you&#039;ll feel an effect, but i&#039;ve found slightly diminished. Usually within 7-8 days I feel the tolerance is usually gone. This is all probably pretty subjective user to user.<br />

				IMO: wait at least 2-3 days. And you will need to take a bit more.<br />There are people taking it everyday. Crazy amounts though.<br />Strong trips are better for sometimes a year. Small/medium for combo;s.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a wonderful thread over on Bluelight that gives the subjective tolerances of various users and graphs it. You might want to skim through the thread, but overall it&#039;s very accurate in my experience. Typically after one week you are ~120% close to baseline, meaning you need a 120% LSD dose to achieve optimal effects. Following two weeks, you&#039;re tolerance should have reset. Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING:<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread

				Depends on how much you&#039;re taking per trip. A larger dose will keep you tolerant for longer. If you trip on 10-50 Âµg at a time, you could fit three trips in a week. (Yes! The drug is still effective at those low levels.)

				For an average trip?&nbsp; 4-5 days and you&#039;ll be at no significant tolerance to trip again (at least to trip as hard as the last time)<br /><br />I try not to trip on acid more than once a month at a minimum, shit&#039;s heavy on the soul, but well worth it.&nbsp;

				Like someone said before, if you do it more frequently it loses it&#039;s magic &amp; uniqueness and becomes &quot;just another drug...&quot;.<br />In my opinion - Once a month or two is the best.<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace

				The only way your going get that &#039;magical&#039;, seeing the world for the first time feeling is if you totaly cleans your system. at least four weeks of NO phycadelics . but you can also get good trips when dosing once every 10-15 days.. only it wont be one or two hits and your content, more like 5 or 6 lol

				I am a veteran of 200-plus Grateful Dead concerts. I once took acid, a lot of acid, good acid, 6 nights in a row. I don&#039;t remember building up a tolerance, but then again, it&#039;s sometimes difficult to tell how hard you are tripping at a Dead show because everything is so trippy to begin with. I will say that the more consecutive nights you trip, the more difficult it becomes to perform simple tasks, like distinguishing between the red &amp; green lights in a traffic signal, when you lay off the acid.&nbsp; <br />My advice would be to use it only for special occasions, outdoors, in natural settings of great scenic beauty and with only your most trusted friends.&nbsp; But then again, my ancient, drug-addled brain is&nbsp; having trouble remembering what was your original question - so maybe I&#039;m not the right person to be giving anybody advice on anything. <br /><br />Good luck. Have fun. Be safe. <br />&nbsp;

The thread began as asking how long between LSD trips, and just as i said..it shall be.lol RCs on the other hand are greatly un known . Ive done a hand full of tabs of both 25c/i, and while both where great, C more so than I imho, they where by no means anything like legit clean LSD, which as all that I, or anyone should fuck with when it comes to L. <br />&nbsp; Again im not knockn you in anyway, Just your experience and thoughts here are irrelevant to the matter at hand lol, so its not so much of an either or. Its if you want to trip balls on LSD, you do legit LSD..if your looking to get face and or head fuck tripping on some really cool shit that will most def be fun, then drop RCs.. Though in saying all that, its my opinion( as far as RCs are concerned)..because ive heard dozens of reports of people not handling the RCs well at all and totally buggin the fuck out, not to mention the 5+ deaths from 25i due to stupidity and accidental over dose. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -DB
