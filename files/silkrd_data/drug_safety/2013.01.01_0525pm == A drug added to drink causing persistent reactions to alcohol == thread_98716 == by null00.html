				My friend has a weird reaction to alcohol. After drinking a bigger amount of alcohol, after a few hours, she suffers from seizures of the following symptoms: partial loss of orientation, breathing problems (unnatural breathing in - long, rapid), weird behavior.<br />These symptoms last for more than 3 hours.<br /><br />She said that some time ago, someone added something to her drink and then the problems have started.<br /><br /><br />Does anyone know what causes this reactions? What can help her?<br /><br /><br /><br />(If it&#039;s not the right place to ask this question, please tell me where can I ask.)<br />

				I doubt that it&#039;s so simple.&nbsp; She told us that it was not the first time when she had those symptoms. She was talking with us in normal way.<br /><br />

				Yeah man listen to the advice about seeing a doctor.<br /><br />If asked for a reason when making the appointment just say:&nbsp; &quot;I can&#039;t seem to hold my drink as well as I used to. I am afraid that I may be turning into a lightweight and could affect my rock&#039;n&#039;roll image &amp; lifestyle. I hope that my liver is still functioning properly.&quot;<br /><br />The doctor will probably give you some kind of blood test and then when the results come in can advise you of any necessary precautions or changes you need to make.<br /><br />All the best and I hope it is not too serious.

				Some substances may change the metabolism of alcohol. Actually this is one of the ways to treat alcoholism. She should visit toxicologist. The substance will leave the system by itself, but it may take up to 3 years.
