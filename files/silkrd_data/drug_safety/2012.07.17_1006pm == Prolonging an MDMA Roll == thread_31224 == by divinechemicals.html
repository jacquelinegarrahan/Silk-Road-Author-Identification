				So I&#039;ve been taking Ivory&#039;s MDMA, and as anyone who has taken it will tell you, it&#039;s the best. Anyways, I usually take .25, wait about 40 minutes, and it kicks in. And then like 2 hours later it&#039;s completely done, probably because I&#039;ve done it too much... So does anyone know a good way to keep it going? Should I redose or is that a bad idea? Thanks for any help!

				How often do you roll? you should space it out at least 4 weeks to ensure your brain gets, somewhat recovered. During this time you should eat healthy, get lots of sunlight, intake a high amount of protein and take as many vitamins as possible.<br />Also 0.25 is a very high dose, especially for Ivorys mdma, seeing as 0.125mg has me rollin ballz. try taking less. It might just been overwhelming you so it kills the roll.

				Yeah, if you&#039;re taking that much to &#039;roll&#039; then I would try and let your brain/body heal.<br />As far as I&#039;ve read in the reviews Ivory has some good &#039;ish.<br /><br />There have been a few other threads on here about MDMA safety I think.&nbsp; ???<br />Maybe invest in some vitamins/supplements like 5htp to help recover/rebuild seratonin.<br />There is even a guy on here selling the supplements/brain food on SR. (check the ingredients, good stuff)<br /><br />Redosing: I believe that erowid noted that taking an initial dose of ~125mg then a booster of ~50mg an hour later. Is the ideal dosing.<br />Bodyweight/tolerance/frequency also affect those numbers<br /><br />&nbsp;I would think it should last longer than 2hrs as well&nbsp; &nbsp;??? ???<br />

				My ThinkDeep capsules have been reported to potentiate the effects of many psychedelic substances, including MDMA, while reducing or eliminating the aftereffects. Take one an hour or two beforehand.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/44558c6f44

				Hi Tryptamine, <br /><br />Your pills fascinate me.. and thanks for the help on the other thread, I&#039;ve stocked up on a lot of those vitamins. <br /><br />Quick q.. I notice they have both Piracetam and Aniracetam .. they do very similar things though don&#039;t they? I can&#039;t get Piracetam in my country but Aniracetam is legal. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t realize they&#039;d prolong a roll either.. that&#039;s a neat trick. <br />

				Alpha Brain&nbsp; supplements are awesome<br /><br />serious high quality nootropics, dude was interviewed on the joe rogan experience&nbsp; a solid 2+ hr interview on dmt and drugs and how he perfected this supplement and 2 others:<br /><br />Roll ON<br />&amp;<br />Roll OFF<br /><br />precursors for your roll and damage control for after<br /><br /><br />all three of these are wonderful.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, eating like 4-5 squares of 80%+ dark chocolate for a solid 4-5 days before your roll has gotten rediiiculous feedback

Do you mean taking adderall before during or at the tail end? I&#039;ve heard dropping some 2c-b towards the latter half of a roll but not quite at the end will prolong the night very well. never done it myself though.

				I will agree with 2c-b. Last time I rolled I took 20 mg&#039;s of 2c-b about 3 hours in. No visuals, but it does prolong the roll, and I also felt much better the next day.

				To the OP:&nbsp; Two things: 1) give yourself some time off, at least 4-6 weeks.&nbsp; 2) Always re-dose MDMA.&nbsp; Take your normal dose, and then take half of that dose at the 1 to 1.5 hour point, no later.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard for some people to drop more when they are just coming up or peaking on the first dose, but that&#039;s the best timing.&nbsp; It just works.&nbsp; It will extend your roll smoothly with no up and down.&nbsp; Give it a try.&nbsp; So for you it would be 250 mg and then 125 mg at 1 hour.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming your a big person of have high tolerance or both, because 250 is a hefty dose.&nbsp; But if that&#039;s your dose, then go with it.

				You&#039;ll have to do more research on this, but amphetamine-type drugs, which MDMA is, get eliminated from the body more slowly when you alkalinize your urine. ie: drink/eat baking soda, but you gotta be careful, you don&#039;t want to over do it.

				For the love of all that is good, don&#039;t do adderall (or cocaine) and molly. Any nuerotoxicity from rolling is the result of dopamine getting broken down inside cells that aren&#039;t made to handle dopamine. Adderall and coke both increase dopaminergic activity. It is seriously not worth it.
