				Started around 17h yesterday with dropping 170mg mdma and at 20h30 dropped another 130mg, not so potent mdma I have to say, seller was 0800DocMorris which no longer seems to be a seller.<br />I got to sleep easily and for 9hours what kind of surprised me.<br />Not really toasted today, just a bit tired and tingling legs.<br /><br />I have two coke left-overs that are 200mg and 300mg that I would like to take this evening.<br /><br />Will this do more harm than usual (when taken weeks apart) since I&#039;ve done MDMA yesterday?<br /><br />PS Last time I did mdma was from januari, not done coke since october last year but I have done mephedrone a couple times this year, last time was 2nd may.

				You&#039;re good to go.<br /><br />I&#039;ve blown piles of coke while ON fire MDMA (they actually nullify each others effects to a slight extent, as to my understanding they occupy the same receptors in your brain) and been more than fine.<br /><br />Party on, Wayne!

				It was shite coke, I was feeling little to none high and the only effect was that it kept me awake.<br />Had to wait a while for my heartbeat to drop to take a zolpidem safely or sleep would have been non excisting.<br /><br />I actually felt a bit depressive the moment after snorting.<br /><br />But coke was never my favorite drug.<br /><br />Thanks anyway

				MDMA is a serotonin releaser.<br />Cocaine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.<br />Sure MDMA has light effects on the dopamine system, but with the dosages you provided, there should be little to no interaction between the two drugs.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend it though, as your already low on serotonin, why fuck with your dopamine system? You&#039;re just going to feel much worse than if you did either one.
