				So I buy Hatters vials of black tar heroin cold shoot often. Today, I received mine in the mail. When I IV&#039;d my normal dose, there was absolutely no rush. I figured maybe I missed even though it didn&#039;t feel like I did (my skin will get all red or bumpy or very itchy if I miss) so I did another shot. I still didn&#039;t feel anything. What was odd was that the effects if the dope started setting in much later (like an hour after I did the shots) and I felt high then. It was like when you miss a shot and don&#039;t feel high at first, but start feeling high slowly later. The problem is that I know for a fact I&#039;m not missing my shots.<br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve tried shooting it again a few times, rotating the veins in the crook of my arm. I have not gotten a rush yet. Its very frustrating, and I cant figure out what is stopping me from getting a rush. I have no other opiates right now so I don&#039;t have anything to compare it to. Could it be a problem with my veins? I want to try different veins, but I&#039;ve only ever IV&#039;d in my inner arms, so I don&#039;t know where else to try. Which are the safest veins to shoot in besides the ones in your arms? And does anyone know why this could be happening? Has this ever happened to anyone else before? The last time I tried to IV was about 45 minutes ago. I had no rush and still don&#039;t feel anything at all.

				Maybe give it a rest for a few weeks to lower your tolerance?

				Its not because of my tolerance because it still didn&#039;t work when I increased the amount I was IVing. I just cant feel anything at all.

				wait till you&#039;re completely sober and try to IV again.n If nothing happens you probably have problems with veins or you&#039;re injecting into artery but you would feel hand itching if that was the case. black tar is very bad for veins if you didn&#039;t know. I know that if you inject under skin effect starts after 10 minutes same should be with IM injection so this does not make sense. Maybe pick a syringe with a detachable needle and try droping liquid into your nose ? you should get high in 5-10mins and it&#039;s very fun too and if it works like i said you have vein problems. By the way buying liquid heroin is not smart because it degrades into morphine and loses potency since diamorphine is 2.5x~ more potent than morphine.
