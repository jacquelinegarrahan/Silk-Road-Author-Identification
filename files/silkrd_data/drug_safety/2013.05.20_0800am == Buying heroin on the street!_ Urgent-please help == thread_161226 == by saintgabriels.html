				Hey guys, I need all of your expert help and advice!!<br />I don&#039;t find drugs on the street. I have a guy I know and met through a friend that I get lortabs/vicodin sometimes from when I run out and haven&#039;t gotten an order from sr yet. So I need your help guys! <br /><br />I was getting gas tonight (in the ghetto, mind you) and a guy approached me and said he&#039;s got some dope. Now, since I&#039;m out of any kind of opiate and will be hitting wd&#039;s soon, I&#039;m pretty damn tempted. Damn cop had to pull up right behind me, so obviously I said no and kept driving.<br /><br />I assume by dope, the man meant heroin. (Not to be erm...stereotypical...but the guy looked like a frequent opiate user) Do you just outright ask what he&#039;s got? Would he even know the difference if I asked him if it was #3 or #4 or should I ask is it for shooting or snorting-would he even know? Also...what are typical street prices for say a stamp in an area where cocaine is usually $60 for a half gram, $300 for an 8ball and hydrocodone goes for about $6-10 each for 10mg?<br /><br />Any other comments/suggestions/questions that I need to know if I end up being crazy enough to go back and see if I can score?<br />I realize this is probably dumb, but I&#039;m sure some of you can sympathize.<br />Thanks!!<br /><br />P.S. +1 for everyone that isn&#039;t a complete ass commenting on this, cause I do need advice asap!!

				Well first off, when you approach this person just say something subtle like, &quot;you got that?&quot; or &quot;what are you working with?&quot; or &quot;you got that beige/tan?&quot;<br /><br />If hes selling heroin, any of those will work. Secondly, you need to be aggressive to a degree.. as in dont let him tell you what he has, you tell him what you need. like &quot; i dont bang/snort/smoke, what kind of shit is this?&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;With the prices youve mentioned for other shit, i could only imagine that for your $10 bucks (if he has ten bags) you will not get 100mg, prob more like 30-60mg per. <br /><br />Also do not go with any more cash on you than you plan to spend, keep in in for front pants pocket, dont ware any jewelery, and be stern. People like that feed on weakness. <br /><br />Good luck, let me know how it goes.

				No offense but if you look like a middle class white guy (you might not just guessing) in a ghetto and get approached by a random guy who you don&#039;t know offering to sell you H he&#039;s likely either going to rob you or just sell you some inert brown powder.<br /><br />Generally if a dealer isn&#039;t being recommended to you it&#039;s a bad idea, if only because a dealer who approaches random people is likely to get caught.

Here.. but if your kicking, and are desperate, you will prob go out on a limb and try to score.. <br /><br />Like I said though, be firm with him, make sure he knows your not fucking around, and that you arent a mark/vic/punk. Tell him that if he tries to sell you garbage youll be back to find him and you will TAKE your money back, even if its only $10. <br /><br />&nbsp;Dress down when you go to the hood, the worst clothes you own. The shittier the better. If your driving to the area, park some where if possible and walk to the meet. I dont know where you live, but im from a not so nice area in ny and with the proper attitude and demeanor, where ever there is drugs, you can land some. The idea is to seem like a desperate junky that will stop at nothing to get his fix, by any means necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;Dealers dont treat custys or potential custys badly , because they want to ensure that w.e money you come across goes to them. Shit, you may even get a 2 for 1 deal, lol.

				Look at NYC stamps, for the price of small amounts.<br /><br />Do you just outright ask what he&#039;s got? Would he even know the difference if I asked him if it was #3 or #4 or should I ask is it for shooting or snorting-would he even know? Also...what are typical street prices for say a stamp in an area where cocaine is usually $60 for a half gram, <br /><br />Sure he has to know.<br /><br />The butcher should give you meat instead of bread.<br />And you don&#039;t get gasoline if you want to buy vegetables<br /><br />A dope-dealers sells dope.<br />If he sells meat he is a butcher and when he sells wood, probably a carpenter.

				If you get approached on the street then you probably look like a mark.&nbsp; I would find someone that looks sick and offer to buy a bag for him if he helps you score.&nbsp; Not money, but a bag.&nbsp; That way you will get what he uses for yourself.&nbsp; Make it clear that you hold the money, and dont let him out of your sight.<br /><br />If you dont know how to cop on the streets then you will probably get burned a couple times.&nbsp; Be ready for it, and just move on.&nbsp; You have to gauge quick if this is someone you want to trust.&nbsp; Small talk can work.&nbsp; Or ask to buy a rig off someone.&nbsp; Hit up a needle exchange.&nbsp; It will be h4.&nbsp; Dont ask because he probably wont know the difference.<br /><br />Dont flash money around or you go from the guy that gets him well to the guy that made his night.
