				Just a heads up for anyone wanting to know, <br />the 2ml shot came on maybe a bit slower than a dropper or two in the mouth.<br />Did put me to sleep tough.

				Uh, looks like you decided not to wait and figure out what it was? That&#039;s very risky of you, and others should take note: absolutely do not IV anything if you don&#039;t know what&#039;s in it. I wouldn&#039;t IV that stuff just because of the blue color alone. IVing food coloring/dye can&#039;t be good for you...

				Upon doing some research, I&#039;ve found that alprazolam should only be administered orally. There aren&#039;t even any pharmaceutical IV preparations as far as I can tell. It may work rectally (I&#039;m a big fan of that ROA), but it likely wouldn&#039;t provide any noticeable benefit over oral, and in all likelihood could waste a lot of the drug. Benzodiazepines are not drugs that really provide you much of a rush in the traditional sense of the word, so taking them by any ROA besides oral is fairly pointless. IV diazepam is very pleasant, but hard to administer because it needs to be injected slowly. You pretty much have to insert a cannula to really do it well.<br /><br />I did try snorting some lorazepam once, and didn&#039;t notice any difference than oral.

				I too have snorted benzo but found the effects to be more placebo than anything and IV diazepam is a liquid preparation designed especially for that ROA, no?

Diazepam is not soluble it water, so it has to be dissolved in a combination of alcohol, propylene glycol, and sodium benzoate. This will burn your veins if you inject it too quickly (this is personal experience here. I ignored the &quot;slow IV&quot; warning on the ampoules I used to get). Aside from that, I&#039;ve only seen the pharmaceutical ampoules on SR once, and I think they&#039;re pretty much non-existant outside of a hospital/clinical setting. But if you do get your hands on some, they&#039;re quite nice.&nbsp;

You&#039;re very intensely and quickly sedated, if that makes any sense...
