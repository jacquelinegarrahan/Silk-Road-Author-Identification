				Well first of all, LSD is Acid, correct? Me and 3 friends just tripped for the first time on mushrooms yesterday. Now my one friend wants to try Acid and I told him I&#039;ll get some for him. I&#039;m debating on trying it with him but honestly don&#039;t know anything about Acid. So I have a few questions...<br /><br />1. Is some acid mixed with other things? For instance do some people sell &quot;purer&quot; acid?<br /><br />2. How much acid should we take for the first time? I took 2.5 grams of mushrooms and hit me pretty good, it hit me first out of my 3 friends. So I&#039;m thinking I have a low tolerance to psychedelics. My friend on the other hand had 3.5 grams, ate another 1.5 about 2 hours after and he said he only tripped a little bit so he has a higher tolerance.<br /><br />3. Is there different kinds of LSD?<br /><br />4. Which vendor do you recommend buying from? And what kind &quot;if&quot; there are different kinds?<br /><br />5. I hear some people say LSD is one of the most safest drugs to use. Is this true? Any negative effect? Is it as safe and mushrooms?

				1. Is some acid mixed with other things? For instance do some people sell &quot;purer&quot; acid?<br /><br />LSD is pure. You really can&#039;t cut something that small.<br /><br /><br />2. How much acid should we take for the first time? I took 2.5 grams of mushrooms and hit me pretty good, it hit me first out of my 3 friends. So I&#039;m thinking I have a low tolerance to psychedelics. My friend on the other hand had 3.5 grams, ate another 1.5 about 2 hours after and he said he only tripped a little bit so he has a higher tolerance.<br /><br />100-150ug is the common dose that gets everybody tripping. also be aware, LSD can degrade when shipped to you. If you order 150ug, it could lose potency.<br /><br /><br />3. Is there different kinds of LSD?<br /><br />Theres different &#039;brands&#039;, like ecstacy, but the only difference between them is the dosage.<br /><br /><br />4. Which vendor do you recommend buying from? And what kind &quot;if&quot; there are different kinds?<br /><br />Any vendor would do fine. Check feedback, transactions, and approval rate though, and I personally avoid new vendors.<br /><br /><br />5. I hear some people say LSD is one of the most safest drugs to use. Is this true? Any negative effect? Is it as safe and mushrooms?<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say there&#039;s any real danger. Just try to avoid bad trips by keeping a good happy mindset, I avoid this by reassuring myself constantly that I am safe, and that it&#039;s going to end soon. Lastly, you can&#039;t overdose, but I&#039;ve seen friends of mine take 600-800ug at a time and they usually can&#039;t do anything but stare at the floor.

				1. Is some acid mixed with other things? For instance do some people sell &quot;purer&quot; acid?<br /><br />LSD is never &quot;cut&quot; persay but LSD is the one of the most common scammed drug out there. A lot of LSD is other research chemicals on blotter so yes some people do get &quot;purer&quot; acid. Also crystal quality is another thing that differs in lsd. Overall you will generally feel the same effects but the crystal quality DEFINITELY makes a difference in how pure you&#039;re product feels, and to me nothing beats clean xtal quality LSD. IF BLOTTER EVER NUMBS YOUR TONGUE ITS NOT ACID. Acid should be tasteless, and not numbing, while sometimes the blotter art does taste it usually does not and tongue numbing is never a good sign. While the RCs are not nearly as great as LSD, you are still going to trip so embrace and enjoy it still. But you need to get legit LSD.<br /><br />2. How much acid should we take for the first time? I took 2.5 grams of mushrooms and hit me pretty good, it hit me first out of my 3 friends. So I&#039;m thinking I have a low tolerance to psychedelics. My friend on the other hand had 3.5 grams, ate another 1.5 about 2 hours after and he said he only tripped a little bit so he has a higher tolerance.<br /><br />I would honestly recommend 300 micrograms for a great starting trip that actually gives you an LSD experience. Smaller doses are nice still and I quite enjoy them but to actually experience LSD 300 ug at least. Thing is though A LOT of vendors lie about the potency of their LSD. A LOT.<br /><br />3. Is there different kinds of LSD?<br /><br />Yes different xtal quaity and different commercial tabs.<br /><br />4. Which vendor do you recommend buying from? And what kind &quot;if&quot; there are different kinds?<br /><br />3Jane, albionessentialols, or JesusofRave (no particular order) Those are the only people I will get my LSD from. 3jane has an ok supply that pops up every now and then. Albion hasn&#039;t had acid in forever. and JoR is fantastic and has acid really frequently. So in the end I&#039;d recommend paying attention to all 3 but JoR will definitely be your best bet at this point due to supply issues on the other 2.<br /><br />5. I hear some people say LSD is one of the most safest drugs to use. Is this true? Any negative effect? Is it as safe and mushrooms?<br /><br />go to Erowid.org and research<br /><br /><br />If you have any other questions let me know :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

Various ergot alkaloids and cycloalkamides of lysergic acid can contaminate the final product. In addition to manufactured impurities, impurities can also arise from decomposition of LSD. <br /><br />None of the commercially sold drug-testing kits is capable of determining purity.<br /><br />Impure LSD is physically harmless, but it gives you more of a body high, as opposed to the pure mind-expansion of pharmaceutical LSD.&nbsp; You&#039;re less likely to have a spiritual experience with impure LSD. Most people these days have only taken impure or weak LSD.<br /><br />There is also the possibility that it may not be real LSD, but some analogue or research chemical.&nbsp; For this reason, I would suggest ordering from one of the &#039;star&#039; vendors in the Avenders LSD thread, which can be viewed here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. How much acid should we take for the first time?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you are by yourself, I&#039;d take only 50ug (half a tab) for a first trip. <br />If you have a sitter, 100ug.<br />Eventually though you would want to take about 250ug - 400ug. This is the ideal dosage for a spiritual experience. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

As with mushrooms, the danger is psychological and spiritual, not physiological. This danger can be minimised by set, setting, and dosage.

				Thanks for all the info guys, it helps a lot! Definitely encouraged me to want to try LSD now since I know a little more. I plan on getting some in a few weeks maybe, I&#039;ll leave a trip report like I did with my shroom report.

Do you guys think there is a certain amount of times to use LSD and/or Shrooms a month/year? To stay on the safe side and whatnot...

				what Stormtrooper420 and psychedelia said is very true and accurate, but i would like to add jerseycow as another great lsd vendor. if you want to find any other vendors, check out the avengers thread ( located here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0 ) which contains a constantly updated list of vendors selling LSD. this list is determined by lab tested dosage, trip reports, reviews, as well as how the vendor is with communications and a few other factors. if you have any questions about any LSD vendor, this would be the thread to check out. now, if you have any questions having to do with LSD, no matter how crazy it might seem, you can visit this thread without the fear of people flamming you : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84848.0 . i wish you luck on your journeys and hope you have fun :)
