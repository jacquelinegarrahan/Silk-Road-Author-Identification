You don&#039;t want to be injecting almost boiling hot water, bad!<br /><br />When dishing advice like this out guys, its important to remember the gear you usually get and are used to isn&#039;t probably the same as what the OP has in front of them.<br /><br />Trying to not use any heat when its needed is a good recipe for an abcess.

				Running a needle under cold water could expose it to bacteria.&nbsp; You want to keep a sterile chain as much as possible with this type of thing.&nbsp; Best practice would probably be to just wait for it to cool down a bit.&nbsp; The best would be to let it cool before filtering.&nbsp; Sometimes things will precipitate, or solidify when the solution cools.&nbsp; It&#039;s better that it solidifies before cooling rather then after.<br /><br />I would also not suggest taking the plunger out if you are really concerned with bacteria.&nbsp; If it is an individually sealed needle you could use the orange tip, or the back of the plunger if it is a BD with a cap over the back.<br /><br />A little heat is good.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you will be just fine.

I have once or twice used water not boiling hot but a little too warm still, and the rash and pain makes it so you never make that mistake again.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine doing it with seriously HOT liquid. Ouch.

				I agree with you completely.<br /><br />When I talk harm reduction I like to use best case examples.&nbsp; We all know what we do in a hurry.&nbsp; <br />If our usual method is poorly prepared, then our rush jobs are downright dangerous.&nbsp; It is easier to learn good habits so when you break them you will be in less danger.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect anyone to never cool it off by running the syringe under water, but knowing that it could cause bacteria to accumulate on the needle is good knowledge to have.<br /><br />Knowledge is power, and in this case it is your own protection.<br /><br />Take cooking coke cut with baking soda as a bad example.&nbsp; When you heat it with a bit of water, the cocaine is an oil.&nbsp; It will go fine through your filter with 0 problems (hypothetically).&nbsp; When it cools it turns into crack.&nbsp; Either in your arm, or in your needle.&nbsp; Neither is good.&nbsp; Some places do cut coke with soda since the charge for crack is disproportionate to the charge for cocaine.<br /><br />The ideal would be to let it cool in the spoon, and then you can filter out the bad stuff.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t expect to have that happen, but it would be better to not take the chance if we are talking harm reduction.<br /><br />I can say in all honesty that I wouldn&#039;t drink some of the stuff I&#039;ve used to cook shots.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean I would tell someone else it was a good idea.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to argue, just show my perspective on it.
