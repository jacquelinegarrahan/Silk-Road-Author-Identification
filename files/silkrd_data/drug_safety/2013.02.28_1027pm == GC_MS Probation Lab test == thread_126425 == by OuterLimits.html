				My probation uses GC/MS every test....do you think I could still use any RC&#039;s like methoxetamine (mxe) or any synthetic cannabinoids such as am-2201 or ur-144? With GC/MS are they looking for EVERYTHING ir just the main drugs?<br /><br />Basically, I&#039;m wondering... do they look for the top 50 mainstream drug and rc metabolites or does it print out a 50 page report of EVERY metabolite?

				PHEW...GC/MS?! That sounds quite invasive. Are they testing your urine, or something else like your hair? I assume GC/MassSpec means they&#039;ll be able to see EVERYTHING, including usually undetected phenethylamine psychedelics and RC&#039;s. I hope someone else has a better, more definitive answer, but to me, it sounds like you&#039;ll be stuck with taking legit LSD (metabolizes quick, only detectable for a VERY short window - basically, while you&#039;re tripping and not long afterwards) and drinking.<br /><br />If you know the exact day of testing, you can prob get away with taking a xanax here and there or a line of meth or coke or bump of H (basically all these things are gone from your urine in a week or two) and be fine - if it&#039;s your urine they&#039;re testing.<br /><br />If it&#039;s hair, I wouldn&#039;t touch anything. idk much about drug testing of hair, but they can take it from anywhere on your body, so shaving your head is a non-issue - they&#039;ll go ahead and take your pubes or pit hair or leg hair or whatever. Hair is very revealing and goes back as far as your hair is long. Your blood nourishes your hair and everything you put into that bloodstream is probably going to get stuck in your hair.<br /><br />Anyone else with&nbsp; better answers???

				Let me give you a better idea....<br /><br /><br />I pee in a cup that has one of those thermometer stickers on it (in front of someone). Once the temp is verified, I placed a special seal over the lid and cup to prevent tampering, further i then seal it in a special bag and put another tamper proof label over the bags seal before placing it in a refrigerator with about 20-50 other urine cups.

				Well, if it&#039;s just urine - refer to the above advice. I&#039;ve had friends who were on probation before who partied with me using hard drugs (no weed). They had pre-set dates every month for meeting with their PO, so they knew by when they had to be clear of substances in their urine. They were able to partake immediately after meeting with their PO and up to maybe 2 weeks before going back in for another test.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny...the hard drugs are easier to conceal use when they schedule your UA&#039;s than is a little bit of THC.

				Yescbut mine arent pre set dates....I get a random phone call and have 48 hrs to report....I highly doubt they&#039;ll look for MXE on gc/ms but want to know for sure....

				It&#039;s a lot easier to get by on paper when you&#039;re clean, even when you know the drugs you&#039;re doing won&#039;t show on the test. Not worth doing time over i can assure you.

				If ya gotta ask, I&#039;d stay away. 48 hours isn&#039;t much time to get clean or attempt to get clean with &quot;detox&quot; juice preparations. I don&#039;t think they have to &quot;look&quot; for anything when it&#039;s GC/MS...whatever is in the sample is going to bring up a result, and if there&#039;s a suspicious looking section, you can bet a lab willing to do GC/MS in the first place is going to do its job correctly and attempt to find out what that &quot;something&quot; is.

				Quick answer, no it wont be detected. The tests are very specific and it is weeks of effort to detect things not on their predetermined list.
