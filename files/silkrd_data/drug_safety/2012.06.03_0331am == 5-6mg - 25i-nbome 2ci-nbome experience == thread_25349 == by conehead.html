				So last night I got drunk. I had some friends over and I drank about 2 bottles of wine before eating, then took some 2ci-nbome. I started with 1 hit, then another about 30 minutes later. I find this helps the come up to be more smooth.<br /><br />I was still drinking while the tabs were in the mouth. I&#039;m unsure exactly how much was wasted. I ended up eating 5-6MG of the chemical total in a 3-4 hour period. With the last tab still in my gum we went to the movies to see the dictator.<br /><br />One side effect I have been noticing is the strange body clamminess and sweating. During the movie I peaked and had to take off my glasses because the sweating was fogging them up so bad I couldn&#039;t see well. I sweat particularly hard on my forehead and around my eye sockets. Usually a bath solves this. I don&#039;t know why. I am very passive when tripping so things like that do not bug me.<br /><br />The way home was intense. Leaving the theater and walking the hallway that was alive with plasiticity and color, and then seeing the movie posters that seemed to smile at me. Not the people in the posters, but the posters themselves seemed happy. I touched Will Smith&#039;s face and said, &quot;I have a black friend.&quot;<br /><br />After some terrible confusion as to what vehicle was ours, we went home and I fell into the swimming pool, rounding out an extremely good evening with friends. Good wine goes very well with this drug, but I recommend keeping a closer account of how much you take.<br /><br />I do not recommend high doses of this drug because of the vascular side effects. I&#039;m almost scared to check my blood pressure today because I usually have lingering high blood pressure for days from this substance. I have gone as high as 185/120 during the come up on this before. I find sex reduces the blood pressure effect greatly. I have no idea why.<br /><br />I find the body effects of the drug unsettling. I would much rather do LSD, if not for that, then for the euphoria that you do not get on this drug. This drug for me is like the visual aspects of LSD, with some body load, and no head trip. It&#039;s purely visual. It&#039;s very psychedelic. Closed eye visuals were insane last night. I could close my eyes and still see everything that was there with my eyes open, and things would continue to happen. People would move, walk around, twist and turn into weird patterns and colors. It was very intense. In terms of &quot;realness&quot; or &quot;vividness&quot; of the hallucinations I would say it is around 4/10 closed eye. They are very much present, but in terms of looking as real as with my eyes open, it is only about half way there. It is fun to get lost in there watching everything happen, but I find that I do this drug around people and they want me to stay present. HAHA :)<br /><br />Today I had 2 hours of sleep and had some things to do. I had lingering effects such as breathing walls/floors, etc. I had closed eye visuals, although very weak, as late as 30 hours after the dosing. I also feel very spent, which is certainly mostly the alcohol&#039;s fault. I have 4 hits left here and I believe I&#039;m going to wait for a day off and dose 2 each with a friend. This will be my last 2ci-nbome experience. I quite enjoyed it and would caution others from doing it. I think it is a good idea to use chemicals that are known to be more safe, such as LSD, mushrooms, etc. I do not like the idea of making myself a test subject. I also do not recommend anyone with high blood pressure takes this substance. My blood pressure is controlled via lisinopril ~40mg. It skyrockets on this substance. Last night I did not record it because I knew it was sky high and didn&#039;t want to worry. It was not as if I was going to go to the hospital without having a stroke first anyway, so why bother myself.<br /><br />Thanks, and good journeys! A big thanks to duderugs for making this possible for me!

				Not even 6mg of 25i could make the dictator as good as his older movies.

				The movie was fun. It was so fast moving that I had trouble following it. I was just sort of staring at the screen and watching everything go nuts. In the bright scenes the cloth hanging on the walls was much more interesting than the movie. It glowed bright red and sort of dripped down from the ceiling. Neeto. I do remember laughing and quite enjoying it even though I didn&#039;t know exactly what was happening most of the time. It seemed there were multiple story lines or something. I will need to watch it sober to know for sure. I could have just been drunk and on drugs. :)<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I wasn&#039;t on so much chemical. Maybe 1-2mg. I find at 1mg, my thought processes aren&#039;t fucked with too much. At 5-6mg, it was hard to interface with the counter person selling the tickets. I do remember they played the song from &quot;grizzly bear&quot; that has the 4 guys with big eyes who&#039;s heads turn into a sparkler. I was happy it was in the movie, if only for a second.<br /><br />I did not like Bruno as much as Borat. I reserve final judgement on this latest one, but it was more of a drama than the other two. There was a romantic plot involved too which I am no fan of.

				I enjoyed reading your experience and advice. When I first time tried a 1 mg 25i-NBOMe (n bom) blotter - after waiting 40 min - didn&#039;t notice any effect. Then., bcoz i&#039;d given my other blot to a friend, i dropped 150mg crystal e and fuck, in minutes my clothes were soaked in sweat was helped to a cold shower (in winter), bcoz i kept passing out and being revived my my mate ... partly (or wholey) my fault .... forgot to drink/electrolytes/juice .. after rehydrating i came around and felt like a kid again - everything looked sumptuous and i was full of empathy. Closed eyes visuals, felt loving, empathic .... But in retrospect, I prefer clean LSD or mushies - much less (if any?) body/physiological unpleasantness rather than potentially life-harming, dangerous reactions - but to be fair - in my case it was probably mostly the e or a combination of both.

You really need to be in an absolutely perfect mindset when you take LSD and even a shred of worry or doubt will fuck your trick up. 25i-NBOme is similar to mushrooms in the sense that (not saying the actual effects are the same) you can party and while you won&#039;t have the incredibly deep introspectiveness of LSD&nbsp; you have great time and you will have some fun visuals. Also I think for both of them the biggest problem is tolerance, they both have pretty stellar amounts of tolerance so you need to space out your doses. But you can take 25i-NBOme once a month and you will probably never have a bad trip unless your just in a bad mood to begin with.<br /><br />It really is like a cross between MDA and LSD as there is fun visuals, a bit of introspection, and mild mood elevation but it doesn&#039;t make you just flooded with serotonin like MDA/MDMA. <br /><br />I&#039;m getting this stellar newer NBOme called 25D. I hear it is pretty amazing and it is crazy rare. I had to wait 2 months for my supplier to make a custom synthesis. You seem like a cool guy, would you like a free sample of it?

				I like nbome quite a bit, but shit you would have to pay me to take 2mg let alone 6mg and leave to go anywhere public, and then pay me double to go see that stupid movie. Swimming pool sounds nice though, I have never tripped and gone swimming.

Just take etilozam. It does wonders for comedowns off psychedelics. Non-benzo sedatives don&#039;t do shit for psychedelic comedowns. I haven&#039;t taken a benzo to get high in a long time (over a year) just because I want to make sure my tolerance is low for when I need it for psychedelics<br />

				Thanks for the input guys.<br /><br />I feel I have a strong mind vs nbome. It&#039;s purely visual for me. Very little thought process disruption. At 2mg, it is a very strong experience indeed. I&#039;ve seen some slightly disturbing visuals watching movies on 2mg.<br /><br />6mg and I can&#039;t even tell you the fucking plot to that dictator movie beyond what I know from the trailer. I know I was bored because there was a romance situation. That&#039;s about it. That said, I was able to buy my tickets and get into the theater without getting thrown the fuck out, and that was all I was looking for. Leaving was incredible. So very candy-land.<br /><br />I&#039;m done with 2ci-nbome. It&#039;s a neet drug, but I fear the cardio effects, and I don&#039;t get hard visual effects on 1mg unless I take a smoke a ton of hash with it. I discovered DMT and that&#039;s really the only thing I&#039;m interested in right now (maybe some shrooms later this summer.)
