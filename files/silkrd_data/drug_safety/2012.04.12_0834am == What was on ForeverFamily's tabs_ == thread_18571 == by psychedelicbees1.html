				So I ordered from this vendor/scammer before he got shut down.&nbsp; however I got two different orders from him, one of print and one of the second round of WoW.&nbsp; Now the print are very suttle and don&#039;t seem to be acid, and show random strength throughout, some are good some are junk.&nbsp; the Wow has a very bitter tongue numbing sensation and doesn&#039;t kick in for about 2 hours, but it very visually intense and beautiful.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have the same engrossment into every little thing as I normally do with acid.&nbsp; Also a friend took one and felt like his skin was burning the whole time except when he took a cold shower.&nbsp; So can anyone give me a hint as to what they suspect these might be?&nbsp; I&#039;m more interested in what&#039;s on the second one (WoW) because I want more, but won&#039;t order form him again for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated and I can offer ~$2 worth of BTC, not much but all I can do at the moment.<br /><br />Cheers

				I don&#039;t think anyone will tell you for sure. Judging from described effects DOx can be ruled out, so that leaves 25C-NBOME / 25I-NBOME. Try getting a sample of these and see which one feels like FF stuff.

				There are many different new research chemicals out there that are being sold as acid. I dont know FF but what I do know is that with all these new RCs the only way to buy acid is to use a long time trusted vendor. I suggest using Mitanox. If he is out wait until he gets more. Mitanox has grade A stuff and he takes care of his customers.

				It was different than NBOMEs in that I had energy which I don&#039;t normally get from from them so I thought maybe a DOx since I can&#039;t compare it, but if that doesn&#039;t sound right than who knows.&nbsp; Thanks for the help Bob!

				Numbing, 2 hours comeup and intense visuals sound like 25I-NBOMe to me. It actually gives me energy (probably due to vasoconstriction?). It may have been 5-MeO-AMT (haven&#039;t tried it yet but I have read some reports) but you didn&#039;t puke.
