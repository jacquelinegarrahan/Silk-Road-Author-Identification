				Hey peeps!<br /><br />I fucking love 2C-B, the only downside for me is the bloody tolerance, but that is the positive since I have to wait in-between doses.<br /><br />sigh...<br /><br />

				I find it a nice alternative between MDMA rolls at low doses. You need so little (10mg) to come up I think it&#039;s very cheap. Higher doses get pretty weird and wonderful too. I&#039;m impressed. Little headachy though on the come downs.&nbsp;

				Yeh 2C-B is awesome. it&#039;s only a short term tolerance of 24-48h i believe in which time taking again will do pretty much nothing. I love using it when building up my mdma tolerance

				I tried Nawlin&#039;s 25mg 2cb a couple days ago and really didn&#039;t know what to expect. I had a total mind fuck! I&#039;m a very experienced MDMA(over 10 years) user and have not got into psychedelics. This combination that people were descrbing it as(mix of molly and shrooms) intrigued me and i had extra coins, so i thought I&#039;d give it a try. Here&#039;s my trip:<br /><br />Just gotten off work at 1130pm and it was my last day of work. Girlfriend made me dinner and then i ate a good amount. Now I had the 2cb sitting there for quite some time, so i decided i&#039;d pop it tonight.&nbsp; My girlfriend didn&#039;t want to, as she had work the next day. Was a little concerned the food would cause me not to feel anything or delay it like with e, but oh well. Well i popped the pill and just freshening up for bed. I started to feel a tinge at 1145ish and i knew I was coming up. Body started to get heavy. I laid down and starting watching the show Jericho. It&#039;s about 12am, my vision was getting intense and vivid. Body high felt and holy fuck, the show just got all intense. Everything was 3-D and i felt as if I was a part of the show. Then everything look like a comic book. There was a part where one of the character dies and man i could feel everyone&#039;s emotion. It got way too real for me so i told my gf to shut it off.<br /><br />At this point i started seeing swirlys everywhere and vibrant colors. I started to feel enclosed like all i could see is one inch in front of me. My mind was fucked. I couldn&#039;t think for the life of me. I could not even talk. I tried going to the bathroom and holy fuck. Everything looked like geometric like and then when i looked in the mirror, i looked like a damn gnome. I went back to bed and everthing then felt like it was closing in on me and I got anxious. This is when i didnt know where I was anymore or if this was my reality. I thought all the visuals were real life and was questioning if i was real at all. Wonder if this will last forever. It was a mindfuck for me. That&#039;s all I could say. I wanted it to be over. <br /><br />I catch myself and remember this is just a trip and to relax. I looked at my gf and could see inside her skin. Looked at my hands and same thing. Felt like it was aging. I felt the peak starting to wear off and then that&#039;s when i felt like it was more like E. We had sex for the next hour and it was fucken intense metally for me, but i couldnt cum. I got so much vivid pictures in my head of her body...like i could see her inside from feeling it. It fucked up my senses and mix it around. This part i really enjoyed. Well after that she went to sleep and i felt things coming down. Still saw objects with swirlys and i felt my body moving and hands doing intricate hand dancing techniques i never knew i could do. When it wore off, i was tired and felt normal. No come down. <br /><br />It was a mindfuck for sure for me. Not sure if i ever wanna try it again because that part where i was questioning my existence really freaked me out.

				Wow - that sounds like quite an experience!<br /><br />It sounds like your experience was at the more intense end of the spectrum that 2c-b can supply for the given dose.&nbsp; I was like that as well the first few times I tried it, then I fell more in line with what is the average experience.<br /><br />If you feel like you do want to try again, the next time you order, drop me a note (via SR) and remind me of this report.&nbsp; We can try to figure out a more appropriate dose and I&#039;ll make up some custom caps for you.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious as to the duration of the experience.&nbsp; At what time do you think you were completely free and clear?<br /><br />Thanks for posting this.<br /><br />nawlins<br />

I just think i never really experienced psychedelics and that threw me off. I&#039;m more of a coke, weed, and MDMA kinda guy. Tried Salvia once, it was not as intense as this.&nbsp; But damn mind was blown. HAHAHA. That&#039;s all i can describe it as. Duration id say finally faded off around 6 or 7am.&nbsp; So 6 to 7 hours. Towards the end of the trip from id say 4am to 7amish i was just really mellow, but still saw some visuals of swirlys. That&#039;s all i can describe it as. Swirlys objects everywhere. Let me try the other tabs and see how it goes. It gets more mellow with tolerance right? Thanks

				Holy Shit! 2c-b is my favorite drug ever, I got half a gram from googleyes and it is so pure. the first time I took it was 20mg and I was tripping the hardest i ever have. I had the craziest headspace, and time was soooo slow. Visuals everywhere, and the body high feels like a cool relaxing river through your body. I haven&#039;t noticed any tolerance either! I took it everyday this week and tripped off of as little as 5 mg, 12 mg had me tripping so nicely last night. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects yet...

				I really enjoy 2c-b. It&#039;s a bit of a tricky drug in the sense it can varie dramatically in effects even with same dosage. I understand that tolerance plays a rule, but i mean more of the headspace. Sometimes it&#039;s the most uplifting high. Almost on par with mdma. (Not in the sense of fuzzy goodness, but more of shifting your perspective towards the optimistic side of the scale.) Other times, it&#039;s not that it goes dark. It&#039;s hard to explain. It&#039;s more of it allows you to see things more realistic, which sometimes depending on the subject can be pestimistic. Most people report that 2c-b is extremely visual. I agree with this, but it&#039;s not visual in the way i expected. I expected more morphing, breathing, and growing. It seems that it brightens colors, with the ocasional tracers. It seems the visuals are more closed eye vs open eve. The part that i&#039;m really impressed about is the clear minded headspace. You can be getting some really intense visuals, and you feel close to sober. (Feels as if you were simply stoned. But, more clear headed than that even.) 2c-i beats 2c-b when it comes to auditory. Music sounds like liquid on 2c-i. 2c-e beats 2c-b when it comes to mental enlightement. I feel that 2c-b is a great starting place. <br /><br />So i would say 2c-b is a very good substance. It has good visuals, nice headspace, some euphoria, and a really clean mindspace. I would immagine it mixing lovely with MDMA for the party, club scene and mixing with MDA for more of a stay at home thing. Anyone got input on mixing with MDMA and MDA?<br /><br />Also, i get horriable headaches on the comedown, some muscle aches, and extreme sleepiness. But, i would rather take that over extreme sweating and jaw clenching and gurning. Snorting hurts like hell by the way.

				People who have seen my post know that I have experimented with a few psychedelics from the road. I&#039;d love to add 2-cb to that resume. I have been reading a lot about it which led me to this thread. I also read up on it at erowid. <br /><br />After reading a few reviews and experiences about it I am excited as ever to give it a try. I really enjoy the LSD and the nbomes from the road that I have done. I&#039;ve done lots of 25i and 25c but only done 25b once and it was great. 2 nights ago I tripped off 2 lotus tabs from JesusofRave and it was great. I should be receiving some 2-cb in a week or 2 and I&#039;ll come back and let you all know about my experience. <br /><br />Wandering how much powder to do since it&#039;ll be my first time and thinking I should just swallow it instead of snorting. From all that I have read it looks like 20 mg would be a good first time amount for me being at my weight and all but a lot of times I have needed more than what I see other people doing to reach my goal so I may do 30 mg right off the bat. It&#039;s a sample pack from a new vendor which I am thinking will include 50 mg of powder and 1 18 mg pill among other things. Any opinions?

				Plugging will reduce the nausea (it does for me) but it is more intense. Use half of an oral dose the first time you plug. I find it combos very well with tryptamines as well, FWIW. <br /><br />As for the clubbing thing, I have to keep the dose very low (5-15mg) if I&#039;m going to be in public. It&#039;s just a nice mild turn-on for me at those levels. Like any psychedelic, it&#039;s always a gamble taking it in public, even though this one is friendlier than most.

				Awesome! I will try plugging it once I&#039;ve found my dose through oral administration. This is supposedly 98-99%&gt;pure 2c-b with some small crystals. I will report on my experiences on oral vs. plugging. <br /><br />I bought 2c-b from Euro PEA. He had me finalize early because of a rather large order and me being a first time customer with him. Because of that he made it a bit over weight. I don&#039;t know how much over weight yet, since I got the package to a safe house in another town. Once I get a hold of the 2c-b I will report back on the weight and the quality. So far I can only say that the service from Euro PEA has been amazing. He is friendly, responsive in messages, even told me to be cautious with the dose since it&#039;s ultra purity _after_ I made the purchase and recommended plugging to reduce body load. The order arrived quickly, only 3 days within EU.<br /><br />Will be back with a report in December. Have other trips scheduled in November :)

				2C-B was great at the start, but having to force myself to sample every batch it got boring after half a year and a shitload of trips ahead.<br />Surely it is a nice psychedelic to start with as a beginning psychonaut.<br />For the more advanced people 2C-T7 and DMT are great, spice brings you into different realms where no 2C-X can bring you.

				2C-B is indeed an awesome chemical, I remember the first time I tried it several years ago when I was 18.

				Just literally tried 2C-B for the first time with my friend.. it&#039;s probably just become one of my favorite chemicals. I&#039;ve had the giggles for 5 hours straight with nice purple and green visuals.. was just staring at the ceiling laughing at shapes that were forming right in front of me and the longer I stared the more interesting they&#039;d become. :) I had some 3D bears forming which was awesome.<br />&nbsp;<br />2C-B is definitely a cheerful from my experience!
