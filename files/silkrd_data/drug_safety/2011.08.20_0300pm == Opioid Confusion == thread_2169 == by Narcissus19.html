				Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to find myself some painkillers that can give me that euphoric feeling - in the past I used to use Vicodin. Now I&#039;d just go ahead and continue with that, but I&#039;m in the UK and can only find other types of opioids for sale.<br /><br />Can anyone point me to a good summary about how &quot;vicodin&quot; is different than &quot;hydrocodone&quot; is different from oxycontin and all the others available for worldwide shipping? Sorry to be such a nuisance, thanks so much y&#039;all!

				Hi,<br /><br />Vicodin and Percocet (hydrocodone / oxycodone) are really just above codeine on the scale of opiates.&nbsp; The most common Vicodin I have seen is 7.5mg and Percocets are usually 5 or 10mg. <br /><br />Everything depends on your tolerance.&nbsp; A person just starting, or one starting after years of not doing anything, will probably get quite the buzz from just 1-3 of either type.&nbsp; You have to watch out for the APAP in these things, taking too many can be bad for your internals (liver/kidneys).<br /><br />Usually the next step up is the IR (Instant Release) type of oxycodone pills like OXY IR 10/20/30 (under many different brand names). <br /><br />Do a simple google search on &#039;hydrocodone vs oxycodone&#039; to start.&nbsp; If you are just starting I would stick to the lower end, keep your tolerance down.&nbsp; It is amazing how quickly it can grow and the next thing you know you are chewing OXY 80&#039;s and barely getting a buzz.<br /><br />Also, do a search on &#039;oxycodone morphine comparison&#039; and you should easily find a table showing the different strength levels of all the different types.<br /><br />

				Vicodin is a brand name. The active ingredients in Vicodin are hydrocodone (which is the narcotic) and acetaminophen (OTC painkiller/anti-inflammatory).<br /><br />Oxycodone is a different opiate which is stronger than hydrocodone. It&#039;s often sold under the brand name Percocet, and what you mentioned, OxyCotin. The brand OxyCotin is OXYcodone CONTINous-release formula.<br /><br />Anyone feel free to expand/correct.

				My bad.&nbsp; I should remember that not everyone is familiar with brand names and what they are actually made of.<br /><br />Nomad is correct.&nbsp; Ask another question if it isn&#039;t clear.&nbsp; Ask as many times as it takes until you are clear.&nbsp; Too easy to make a mistake and hurt yourself with this stuff.

				If you are in the UK then you should have dihydrocodeine. It&#039;s above codeine and below hydrocodone. I&#039;ve heard that its about 2x the strength of codeine. I have heard its very comparable to hydrocodone (vicodin) In some countries its OTC. <br /><br />
