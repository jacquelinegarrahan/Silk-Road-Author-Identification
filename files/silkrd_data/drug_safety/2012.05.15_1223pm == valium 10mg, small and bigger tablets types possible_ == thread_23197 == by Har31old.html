				If they&#039;re both rated as 10mg and from a commercial supplier, both are fine. Some companies use a lot of filler to allow generic vacuum pressing of their pill packs (rather than making several sizes of pills) If you bought them &#039;loose&#039; and they&#039;re chalky, with an uneven colour. Don&#039;t expect them to be accurately dosed. Take half pills at a time to ensure you don&#039;t take a higher dose than you want to. (learnt that the hard way, drug induced sleep for 28 hours.

				Look up the markings.&nbsp; All manufactured diazepam that I know of has markings.&nbsp; If they are unmarked I wouldn&#039;t eat em.

				The pill imprints &quot;dan 5620 (blue)&quot; and &quot;mylan 477 (green)&quot; are the only ones I mess with.&nbsp; There are plenty of fake &quot;roche&quot; brands out there.&nbsp; If the tablet doesn&#039;t have an imprint and you are unsure about what it contains, send a couple off to a lab to get analyzed.

				Tablet size doesn&#039;t mean anything really on 10 mg active substance. Regardless of what make you get, most of the tablet will be filler. <br /><br />The typical form factor for 10 mg diazepam would be the light blue non-US-Roche tablet, but there sure are legit generics on the market that are completely legit. These include tablets made in india, which are generally white but similar in size to the Roche original. <br /><br />Smaller tablets are also on the market though - for example generics produced by sandoz and actavis. Those are perfectly legit, but the only sure way of telling is chemical analysis. There is absolutely no way you can determine if a diazepam tablet is geniune just by looking at it, and imprints are faked easily too.
