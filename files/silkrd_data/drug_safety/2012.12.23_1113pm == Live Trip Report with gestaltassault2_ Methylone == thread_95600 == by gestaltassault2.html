				T+ 0:00<br /><br />Welcome to another episode of Live Trip Report with gestaltassault2. Today we will be exploring the effects of 182mg of what i suspect to be methylone. I obtained these capsules that were sold as molly before I found out about SR. However, unlike the majority of drug users, I always reagent test before I take. Marquis reagent result for these capsules was bright yellow, so this is either methylone or MDPV. However, I did try roughly 80mg of the powder of one of the capsules and I didn&#039;t feel all sped up like I&#039;d expect MDPV to make me feel so by process of elimination I&#039;m assuming this is methylone.<br /><br />Anyways...182mg (full capsule weighed on a scale minus the weight of an empty capsule) down the hatch washed down with with some raspberry melon Gatorade. I ate some sushi about an hour ago.<br /><br />I did 100mg of 4-MEC about 3 nights ago...hopefully there won&#039;t be any cross tolerance...<br /><br />As far as other substances I have experience with: marijuana, MDMA, MDA, LSD, shrooms, meth, Adderall, Ritalin, cocaine, 4-FA, 4-MEC, MPA, nitrous oxide, isobutyl nitrate, Salvia divinorum, ketamine, Vicodin, Tramadol, Xanax, Ativan, ephedrine, caffeine...<br /><br />I am going to watch some episodes of National Geographic&#039;s Drug Inc. now while I wait for it to kick in...

				T+ 0:30<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling a bit anxious but relaxed. There is a tightness in my chest. My heart rate is elevated. My throat is getting a little dry. I feel a bit of muscle tension in my shoulders. I don&#039;t know if I can call this euphoria. It kinda feels like the endorphin high you get after a good workout.<br /><br />It is safe to say that I am off baseline right now. Currently about a + on the Shuglin scale.

				T+ 0:45<br /><br />I feel a knot in my solar plexus. I seem to be burping a bit. I feel lighter. Feels like the body high you get from smoking a good indica but I still feel clearheaded yet not quite as articulate as I felt on 4-FA. My eyes still aren&#039;t dilated.

				T+ 1:00<br /><br />It feels good to stretch. My heart rate has gone up a bit more. My palms are sweaty. I can feel my feet getting sweaty too. No nausea but the burping continues. No jaw tension yet. This feels a little like 4-FA without the jaw tension or articulate stream of consciousness. I still don&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve broken through the Shuglin +. Eyes still aren&#039;t dilated. Despite feeling off baseline, I&#039;m actually feeling quite bored right now. I&#039;m gonna go smoke a cigarette.

				T+ 1:18<br /><br />Well that cigarette seemed to kick things off. I&#039;m noticing a slight delay in my reflexes. I feel mild waves of euphoria comparable to about 50mg of cocaine minus the energy. Makes me feel like mmmmmmmmmmmmm oh yeah. 100mg of 4-MEC had a more intense rush of euphoria than this. While smoking a cigarette I was watching trees blowing gently in the wind. It was pleasant. I felt like I was living in a painting. My throat feels a bit drier now. Raspberry melon Gatorade tastes great. Starting to feel jaw tension now. Time for some gum. Watching the episode of Drug Inc. about Ketamine. There was a scene of a rave, made me wish I was there.<br /><br />I read a trip report on erowid about methylone. one of the terms they used to describe it was &quot;relaxed euphoria&quot;. good description. I see what he was talking about. Also the description of it being like MDMA without the magic or the empathic push.&nbsp; I feel like I could connect with people right now if I chose to.<br /><br />My pupils are slightly dilated.

				T+ 3:18<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;m returning to baseline now. <br /><br />Since my last report, I watched a bit of TV. Since when did Nickelodeon become so violent? I was watching a show called Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh. I caught it right around a part where either Rick Ross or Kimbo Slice wearing an orange prison suit (they look the same to me and I couldn&#039;t really tell who it was) was smashing some white kid&#039;s head thru the concrete wall of a prison cell so they could break out...Then all of them were confronted by a team of prison guards with their guns fully drawn...firearms pointed at fellow human beings on a kid&#039;s show...my how Nickelodeon has changed since I was a kid...<br /><br />The empathy of this substance is apparent...I overheard one of my flatmates who&#039;s going through a divorce talking to her ex-husband and her son telling how much her and her ex-husband love their son but the relationship just won&#039;t work...i felt the words to be very genuine and from the heart...<br /><br />This left somewhat of a bittersweet in the air....which inspired me to do something nice for everyone...I cleaned the mountain of dishes that was piled in the sink...and for me this is not normal as I am rarely home and I&#039;m pretty much a lazy bastard...however I found this chore somewhat fun to do on methylone...it was like a video game...i started with the small stuff like spoons, knives, and forks...moved my way up to washing glasses which felt somewhat erotic because the soap made my fingers the glass slippery and i was basically fisting the cup to wash it...hahaha...then i conquered the bowls which were like boobies to me...and then the plates which were like giant nipples to me...which earned me enough experience points to fight the main boss....a huge frying pan that was caked with grease....<br /><br />It just felt good to do something productive and right now i feel like i&#039;m on a roll (pun intended) so i might just continue tidying up around the flat....i thought the whole neat freak cleaning house thing only applied to tweakers and meth heads....is meth a metabolite of methylone? lol<br /><br />CHEERS!!

				T+ 4:18<br /><br />Bonus level!! I found more dishes on the coffee table!! Take that you filthy dishes!! The mood lift of methylone is great...I&#039;m over the peak but still I feel really positive about whatever it is I&#039;m doing at the moment....it really is making doing the most boring, mundane tasks which normally, I&#039;d be reluctant and opposed to doing, actually fun to do!!<br /><br />By the end of tonight this place is gonna be so neat and presentable that maybe just maybe...girls will actually stay when I bring them over....

				Yes, as Aurelius says, it is very possible to fall into a cycle of abuse with M1 - I never got to his level myself but I can remember points at which I was handling 40 - 50 gs of it at a time ( doesn&#039;t sound like much, but for me that was an insane amount of drugs, more than I ever thought I would have ) and doing around a gram a day I would say. My ROA was to dissolve it in water and rectally administer it, which isn&#039;t entirely necessary but it is AMAZING that way. The comedown is way worse though, you get extremely high ( for M1 ) and then within an hour or so want some more. This ROA had be administering probably 5 times a night once an hour at doses starting at 100 - 150 mgs and ending at 200 - 250 before I just decided to put it down.<br /><br />That being said, I never really felt the heart trouble that he had at those doses, except for one time early in my drug career where I had two capsules filled with 300 mgs or so of it and I rectally administered one and then another at t+30 minutes without realizing that the cap from the first one hadn&#039;t dissolved yet, and got uncomfortable. Extreme tachycardia, and some delusions as to whether or not I was still alive... however, one thing I have to say is that the CEVs were INTENSE, the closest thing to astral-projection I have ever experienced. I had become a disembodied soul floating around this ethereal version of places I had visited in the past, except the world had been filled with giant flying worms made of blades that flew in and out of my body. However, I get CEVs from just about anything... I suppose I have a very vivid imagination :P <br /><br />But it was probably, in hindsight, the best M1 experience I have ever had as it taught me to treat the drug with respect. After that, I still went on binges, but never &#039;overdid&#039; it as far as a single dose went. <br /><br />If you abuse it over a week or so, an interesting effect can be observed where the serotonergic qualities of empathy and euphoria and mood lift become replaced with the CNS and PNS stimulation from the high dopaminergic activity of the drug. After four or five days, using every day from the moment I woke up to the moment I decided to stop using, M1 became little more than like an adderall equivalent to me, as I felt little to no euphoria. If I had chased the high at that point I probably would have got the problems Aurelius stated, but I didn&#039;t do so. <br /><br />Really, if it weren&#039;t for that quality, I would say it&#039;s more abusable than Mephedrone... although the wonderful qualities of the drug are pretty much lost after the first few binges. Enjoy the rushing while you have it, because the more you do the more the magic is lost. Mephedrone seems... longer lasting, as far as a quality high goes, I think. I still enjoy M1 more, though. <br /><br />My advice for your next trial would be to pre-load a few days beforehand with some 5-HTP, and take a higher dose ( maybe 200 mgs for a starter and then a 250 or 300 mg booster on the comedown ) as well as experiment with ROA. Snorting is shit, in my opinion - it makes the entire thing last a lot shorter and the drip is god-awful, but oral dosage can be good if you measure out a dose and then dissolve it in water or juice before you take it. I can&#039;t stress enough how much faster the come up is when you dissolve it in a small amount of water and take it like a shot of liquor. It&#039;s quite good. My favorite ROA would still be rectal, but I realize that not everyone&#039;s &#039;down&#039; with that sorta stuff. Haha.<br /><br />
