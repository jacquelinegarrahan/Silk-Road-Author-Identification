				I&#039;m early in my psychonaut career, and I recently had an extremely disturbing experience after smoking a joint while I was tripping on mescaline. It escalated into a full on panic attack where I was certain I was going to die. Does anyone have any methods to salvage a trip when it&#039;s spiraling out of control, and are there any common triggers of a bad trip to avoid?<br /><br />Any advice from expert trippers would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I think that with hallucinogens you have to just take each experience as it comes and learn from it. Every time you have a &#039;bad&#039; trip, try to take something away from it, think about what you experienced and why. Reintegrate your experience with your everyday reality, perceptions, personality and relationships. Take at least a week out between trips to think.<br />In every subsequent trip you&#039;ll learn to recognise familiar places, thought processes and events which can take you to good or bad places. Once you&#039;ve learnt which doors take you to bad places, you can avoid them or open them and tackle what&#039;s behind. I think what scares lots of people is the realisation of how deep your mind can go and what a thin veil our perception of reality is.<br /><br />It&#039;s a crap metaphor but for me a trip is like being made to navigate a huge, complex space in complete darkness but is randomly and briefly illuminated. <br /><br />You learn your way around your own brain.&nbsp; :D

				I have been a daily pot smoker (vape now - much better) for almost 20 years.&nbsp; I have never enjoyed smoking pot during psychedelic trips at least until the very end of the session...<br /><br />Cannabis can make anyone paranoid at any time. Some people are more sensitive than others. When you are new to psychedelics it is best to avoid pot IMO.<br />

				Zyprexa always seems to help us when we are having a bad LSD trip and it also helps with the paranoia/anxiety attacks from smoking weed. You only need to take a small dose of 5mg or half of a 10mg tablet.<br /><br />We stock this medication for International Delivery: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/13229<br /><br />Please do your research also!<br /><br />EnterTheMatrix

				Yeah, I am curious as to what things (if anything) can actually stop a bad trip while you&#039;re having it? When I took MDA last week or whenever that was, I had fun for a while, but eventually I just wanted so badly for it to end. It was a different experience, I wouldn&#039;t really say it was bad, but I had texted my friend and he told me something like &quot;grape juice stops LSD trips&quot; or something like that, I don&#039;t remember lol.. But does anyone know anything about that? Is there a list somewhere of remedies like that and what drugs they interact with?

				I am for riding trips out even when they seem overwhelming, which can best be done by trying to keep a calm mindset and focusing on your breathing and relaxing all your muscles (if you meditate it would be the perfect time). Get up and walk around or just change your setting like the music or lighting. Best thing to do can be to go outside and walk around in nature if possible to do safely. IMO only use psychedelics at first with long histories of safe use, such as mescaline, lsd, and psilocin so you can re-assure yourself of the safety of the chemical. Weed certainly has always pushed trips into another direction and can take the experience up a notch sometimes, but also can sometimes be prone to cause a sense of ominousness characterized by anxiety, although I still always smoke. This past time a few weeks ago it really catalyzed my moderate cactus extraction experience from a ++ straight to a ++++ while riding out a situation I would have previously tried to escape from in the past, but I am grateful I embraced it and rode it out.<br /><br />Benzos will greatly reduce the anxiety and component of tension associated with bad trips. I feel it also basically ends the trip but others claim they can still trip after a low dose. A sublingual clonazepam or diazepam would be helpful most likely. The combo is wonderful on the comedown from acid and lets me sleep easily after a reasonable time.

				Well even before you dose I&#039;d recommend getting in a good mindset, listen to happy music, meditate or do some yoga if you&#039;re into it, talk to a trusted friend and let them know what you&#039;re going to do so there&#039;s the reassurance in the back of your mind that someone is looking out for you. If you&#039;re into the spiritual thing come up with a ritual to ask your focus of choice to teach you and guide you through the experience.<br /><br />In the throes of a bad trip, I find Pranayama techniques (Yoga breathing, google it if interested) the best method to regain any control over panicking, largely because it helps you focus your thoughts on a single activity which can be enough to put the badness out of your mind. Beyond that, read a few pages of a favorite book or poem, put on a movie with a positive message, or call that friend (provided it won&#039;t make them angry at 4 am hah) At some point you may come to realize that it is part of the psychedelic experience and isn&#039;t strictly a &#039;bad&#039; thing in the first place, just something testing your limits and teaching you about your fears so you may work on them, however it took me several uncomfortable experiences to come to that conclusion on an organic non-forced level.

				I&#039;d agree that riding the trip out is&nbsp; a good thing because its forcing you to confront whatever it is that caused the panic attack in the first place. However if the environment and setting are not good or you have plans the next day you need to been together for - then go the anti-anxiety medication options.<br /><br />Another thing to be aware of is that if its a bad enough panic attack you cannot simply chill out relax, and bust out some yoga moves. This only works for people who have experience in controlling their physiology. There is a point where the body releases adrenaline because it thinks its in danger, that can increase heart rate and blood pressure and last hours depending on the person. So you find yourself in fetal position (which is bad always stretch out or go into a meditative pose) thinking why can&#039;t I think my way of it - its because you body is on autopilot reacting to the panic and stress and flooding your system with adrenaline...and your mind doesn&#039;t have control.<br /><br />So really the focus should be on making sure you don&#039;t end up in that state in the first place. So mood and setting - so start in a safe comfortable place and be in a positive happy mood.

				i&#039;ve found that one of the best things you can do when you&#039;re having a bad trip is to sing.<br /><br />taking a shower can also help sometimes.&nbsp; singing in the shower is perfect ;P<br /><br />I know it sounds weird, and is not always possible depending on your set and setting, but if you are in a position to sing, you should.

				oh, and I almost forgot my other thing!<br /><br />when you&#039;re having bad/negative thoughts: try to form all those thoughts into the scariest creepiest tibetan demon face you can imagine, and then make your own face back at it.&nbsp; make the meanest warrior face you can, stick your tongue out, make some grunting sounds, stomp your feet, and bang on your chest.&nbsp; Tell the gods of whatever drug you&#039;re on that you are a great warrior and cannot be intimidated by anyone or anything.&nbsp; if you need to repeat the cycle, go for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;ll either psyche yourself up into thinking you really are a mythical warrior, or you&#039;ll die from laughing about the ridiculousness of what you&#039;ve been doing for the last 15 minutes and why you&#039;ve been doing it.

				When I know I&#039;m going on a psychedelic journey, I make sure my mind is void of negativity. Just is case of the unexpected bad trip, I carry a few xanax with me.<br /><br />If it&#039;s LSD, anti-depressants &quot;short circuit&quot; the trip.<br /><br />However nothing compares to being with your best most trusted companions, in a comfortable setting with a mind at ease.

				I&#039;m a beginner with psychedelics.&nbsp; When I have a bad trip, I try to remind myself that this condition is temporary and things will go back to normal in time.&nbsp; Also smoking weed has helped with bad acid trips, but perhaps it&#039;s not always a good idea because of your case.

				Much good advice above. Any depressants will relax you like benzos, barbiturates, or even alcohol if that&#039;s all you can get. I can drink like a monster on LSD but it ruins the trip. Definitely being in a place you are comfortable and with people you trust will greatly reduce the chance of a bad trip. I like being out in the woods. I remember walking around the forest by myself at night in the rain on mushrooms and feeling like one with nature and the plants and animals.<br /><br />I had some crazy ideas to see how far I could push myself before I cracked. Try going to the dentist for a root canal on acid. That takes some willpower. I dropped a couple hits when my dad was trying to detox from alcohol and didn&#039;t have a negative experience. In fact I felt more empathetic. It&#039;s all in your head. There is no good or bad unless you think it is.<br /><br />Another time I had a seizure from LSD while playing a video game. No doubt they contributed, but I also took a Prozac the day before for no apparent reason. Judging from my symptoms I think I had mild serotonin syndrome. The other people there were freaked out for sure. When I came to, I was covered in sweat and felt like I had run several miles. Interestingly, my trip was almost totally stopped.<br /><br />Another bad trip was on mushrooms that I was growing. I thought I was dying and called 911. Then I came to my senses and called back to say I was fine! They weren&#039;t appreciative of my shenanigans and still sent the police out to see what was up. Somehow my dad covered for me so I didn&#039;t have to talk to them while still tripping hard.

				My first bad trip wasn&#039;t panic attacks or something like that, it was just demonic visions. I was fully responsible for those seeings because I felt urge for somekind of a bad trip deep inside me before. Just for learning purposes. <br />So I knew what to expect somehow but still didn&#039;t expect nothing because the best way for the psychedelics seems to be going with the flow and not thinking in words. <br />Anyway, I sat on my room, lights turned off, some music similar to Gregorian Chants played on vinyl. All the energy you could see, you could feel while tripping on LSD was rushing in my head like screamings of painfully killed people, people who died in the feeling of loneliness. Because I myself was tuned in, it was the moment to be in, here &amp; now like they say. But it was still hard to stand those screamings, it just didn&#039;t seem to be the place where people really ought to be stuck in. Actually I didn&#039;t hear any of those screamings but it was the great conversance of the universe, I really felt that all the energy in this moment can be translated into those screamings like I described. <br />Of course it wasn&#039;t all the trip. Outside it seemed like all the world is empty, I broke some ice on the puddles and the echoes filled all the space. But as you know, on LSD you can see the world as it speaks to you and all my signs while this trip was stuck in one place, where I felt those screamings. <br /><br />Anyhow, next day was like coming back from the war, I myself felt exhausted but the world was in peace for me. And basically all I wanna say is, if you are really into spiritual tripping and great knowledge, don&#039;t see the good or bad sides, just be and you&#039;ll learn. Only thing is to find a place where you can avoid contact of other people, if it seems a bit of overhelming experience to you. (If you can&#039;t find that place, then kids and animals are great companions too, they really are in the way like they feel and it&#039;s almost impossible to not feel good for them while high). But in time, you&#039;ll see that&#039;s all in your head and nothing can harm you. <br /><br />Also, good thing to do is meditate every day. As it&#039;s brings you to the peaceful side of life it really helps to be in peace with yourself while tripping too. If you find that stillness inside you, you really can face all the demons without being scared.<br /><br />

				Like many others have said here, riding out bad trips (assuming it&#039;s a bearable one) is actually a good thing. It&#039;s worth the learning experience. If I find myself drifting to a place that&#039;s mentally uncomfortable for me, I turn on some music or a movie and lie down. I&#039;ve found that the key is to keep your mind occupied. Sometimes I&#039;ll let the bad thoughts just &quot;bounce&quot; off of my mind so to speak by thinking them and then afterwords immediately saying to myself, &quot;But that&#039;s just a thought.&quot; If things get bad enough then pop a benzo or whatever anti-anxiety happens to be laying around. Smoking weed works for some, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it if weed makes you paranoid on its own.<br /><br />In the hundreds of trips I&#039;ve experienced, I&#039;ve only had one really bad trip where I needed to take an anti-anxiety. I was experiencing temporary amnesia (still don&#039;t remember anything about the trip to this day) and my friend had to force me to take a Seroquel. This was largely my fault though because I wasn&#039;t in a very good mindset before tripping. Always make sure that you feel really positive before tripping, as a lot of bad trips can be attributed to a bad mindset.

				Probably you can also avoid bad trip, when you prepare yourself for the trip. In my past time i did a lot of party-using psychedelics (and even do it nowadays) but the best trips i had are those i prepared myself to. I do a lot of mediation and yoga the week for the trip and get myself a target what i want to explore.&nbsp; I also do a lot of reading while i prepare.<br /><br />When a party trip is going mad, i like to push myself &quot;in love&quot; with mdma/xtc. Also zyprexa did well for me.<br /><br />To change the setting or the set is also everytime a good choose to lead the trip in a good way. If you can&#039;t really move irl than you should create yourself a safe place &quot;in your mind&quot; where you can go any time you want.

I find meditating very helpful if you can center yourself, but sometimes the CEVs get to be too much. Sometimes you just need to take a benzo and sleep it off. I had a horrible trip on DOC once, there&#039;s no way anything could have calmed me down during it.

				I think a really good way to deal with a bad trip is to take some valium and go under the care of someone who isnt tripping that can reassure you. Also try to take control in your own mind. If I go into a bad trip, or start to, I tell myself something like &quot;you just did acid everything is going to be fine in a few hours it will wear off, in the mean time you paid for this feeling so just feel good. No bad feelings. I am blocking out the bad feelings and focusing on the good.&quot;<br /><br />I can usually talk myself out of a bad trip. But if I cant I take valium and then reach out to someone who isnt tripping for comfort.

				The first time I did shrooms I almost killed myself. It was like I was stuck in a nightmare that I couldn&#039;t escape.<br /><br />This was when the only things I had previously done were smoke pot and drink, so I wasn&#039;t prepared for a reality shift from tripping. I think I took roughly four grams...<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t freak out whenever I try something new. If it sucks, I just remind myself it won&#039;t be there tomorrow, and I have +1 drug experiences under my belt.

				Meh, I&#039;d rather wake up an old thread than making a new one :P<br /><br />I wanted to share a bad trip of mine which occurred a few days ago.<br />So there I was, sitting on my friend&#039;s porch, in pretty much darkness, filling up my gravity bong with the green herb. Couldn&#039;t really see much so I just put there &quot;by hand&quot;. Started burning and the burning process took longer than usual, was a bit startled, but I was like:&quot;Meh, I&#039;ll handle it!&quot;. When I started to smoke it, I could feel how there was so much more smoke than usual. When I finally finished, I went inside and sat in a comfortable chair. My friend set up the film&amp;everything, we were watching Space Jam. It didn&#039;t take long before... I started feeling that I&#039;m sinking into the chair, sinking feeling that would never end, when I moved myself the world around me was too unreal to describe. I felt the visuals of a mild shroom trip. I stood up, took my glass and muttered something to my friend(I can&#039;t even remember myself what I said and my friend later said he didn&#039;t understand me one bit). I walked to the bathroom to get some water and so I did, but before going back to the room where we were watching the movie I sat down on the floor and just sat there, which felt for... hours.. When I came back the movie hadn&#039;t even gone past first 5 minutes. So I knew that everything wasn&#039;t &quot;alright&quot; with me. I&#039;m a pretty experienced user so I though I could just get over it and enjoy myself, but as soon as I sat on that damned chair and I started to feel sinking again I just couldn&#039;t bare it and went out on the porch. The porch was cold and the night&#039;s air wasn&#039;t warm either. I sat there, tried to close my eyes(ROLLER COASTER!), but somehow I closed my eyes and I held them shut. I started to feel the sinking again, but this time it wasn&#039;t only downwards, it was upwards, sidewards, every possible &quot;wards&quot; one can think of. I was there, eyes closed feeling like the world was trying to tear me to pieces. I sat there until my fingers&amp;toes were numb. I went back inside and started to watch the movie. Which was horrible, if I do say so myself... It was SO unreal and after everything I commented:&quot;That can&#039;t happen!&quot;, or: &quot;That&#039;s SO unreal!&quot; or: &quot;HAHAHAHAHAHHAHBWAHAHAHHAHA!&quot; I felt that after coming back inside, after being seated outside in the cold, I felt refreshed and enlightened in some mysterious way and I felt like I saw everything from a different perspective, but that was an illusion... When the film ended, my trip was still going on and going on strong, but fun. I made it home safely afterwards and went to bed immediately. <br /><br />Lately I feel that I enjoy thinking back to these trips more than the &quot;only fun&quot; trips :P<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what that trip taught me or what I gained, but I still do feel the &quot;freshness&quot; that I gained from coming from outside.<br /><br />~~sitamaja
