				Howdy all --<br /><br />I&#039;m a huge percocet fan.&nbsp; Favorite drug by far and I&#039;ve tried a good bit of everything.&nbsp; I like vicodin but it feels like I have to take 1.5X-2X the amount (/wt) as percs to get me in as good of a feeling.&nbsp; I am happier while on a perc high, nicer to other people, more generous, a &quot;better&quot; person, make offers to do nice things for other people (which I of course regret the moment I run out of supply) and do on the whole a lot of things that are above and beyond my natural tendencies or character.<br /><br />Percs make me feel relaxed.&nbsp; There is a bit of tension with them that I like, but it&#039;s more excitement than anxiety, which is good because I&#039;m always fucking anxious and hate exacerbating it.&nbsp; And they really just make me social and actually enjoy being around other people.<br /><br />Lastly, I do get the common effects with both percs and vics - itchy as a motherfucker, very slightly shaky for 24 hours or so if I come off a week long or more bender, and of course, it is very effective with respect to pain, if I have any.&nbsp; I take ibuprofen pretty regularly (most days of the week) so I don&#039;t really have any use for that, but the couple times I&#039;ve had throat infections from smoking and NOT had any opiates were MISERABLE nights trying to sleep in so much pain.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried morphine once.&nbsp; I had a 30mg pill maybe after I was nearly blacked out from drinking and don&#039;t remember any of it.&nbsp; From what I heard I got really vulgar and hit on anything that moved and had a vagina, really inappropriately.&nbsp; But that might have just been because I was in the peak of my drinking days (haven&#039;t had a drop in nearly 6 months). <br /><br />And lastly, I&#039;ve tried oxy a dozen or so times but it&#039;s been a few years since I snorted it and I&#039;ve never tried Roxy.&nbsp; And the times I did oxy I was very likely also stoned so I can&#039;t really remember the exact differences.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious how they (and morphine pills for that matter) compare in affect as well as your preferences for how to best enjoy them recreationally (while being social, being with a girl, watching a movie alone, day vs night, etc).&nbsp; I&#039;m aware they are quite pricey but I&#039;m willing to splurge to get 100 10/325 percs every few months just for a fun couple weeks and figured I might as well try the others.<br /><br />I also am pretty unlearned in the XR vs IR aspects of all three -- I know I&#039;ve snorted oxy in the past but I also thought the &quot;contin&quot; part of the title was for continuous so maybe we were being inefficient?&nbsp; And brief research suggests Roxy is just the brand name (ie like kleenex for tissues) of oxy and they aren&#039;t different.&nbsp; Anyone with patience for my lack of knowledge/patience to search through threads to find someone I believe actually is worth his weight, I would love to know the difference.<br /><br />tl;dr<br />Mostly curious about/for any and all opinions on roxys, oxys, and morphine, the best way and setting in which to take them (I&#039;m a little too pussy to IV and am not desperate enough to plug), as well as which you prefer overall.<br /><br />Love you all.&nbsp; :)<br />T017

				Just snort a stamp bag of h. Ull never mess with pain pills again they are pointless and do nothing for me. I don&#039;t even do downers but 1 every other month or so.

				Yes i do consider it a downer I was just saying I&#039;m not really into them very much I may do a little every other month or so. But with the pill downers I just sleep no euphoria. I do however like hydros and a weed edible combinatin=crazy spins but I haven&#039;t done a pill in probly 5 months and haven&#039;t done h but 2 times. I just think once I did h I wouldn&#039;t waste my money on a roxy.

				i started out doing oxycontin. its all kinda a blurr, i wish i knew how long it took to get to the point where i was doing 200-300mg a day. after that i switched to powder heroin cause it was stronger and ridiculously cheaper. then i quit everything for a year only to start the circle over again, this time discovering bth. heroin is much much better then pills in every way possible. if youre gonna be a drug user u might as well go all out.<br /><br />if pills are your things though i wouldnt suggest percs or hydrocodones or anything with acetaminophen that stuff sucks. oxys are good, dilaudids are bomb if you shoot em but idk about snorting em (i hear its not as effective, but then again what is in comparison), i got my hands on some fentanyl patches once, if i didnt have a habbit already i think i woulda died, i had to keep taking it off, i wanna say they were 100mg but honestly i forget. morphine pills are good but not my first or second choice.<br /><br />i used to get the high youre describing best with oxys. but i feel like the withdrawal was worse than heroin sometimes. if you get itchy take a benadryl or 3.

				How to remove the Tylenol from Percocet..... Enjoy.<br /><br />Quick sloppy method.<br />Dissolve 10 per quart in warm water that is PH balanced at 7.3+<br />Chill for 4 hours until cold<br />Strain out of 2 coffee filters- it should take&nbsp; a long time (6-12 hrs) to strain and water should be crystal clear.<br /><br />Here is my Pro-CWE instructions.<br /><br />PureO Tonic.<br />This is a Cold water extraction recipe that will allow you to remove nearly all the acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol, or APAP)from Percocet.<br /><br />There are many CWE (cold water extraction) recipes out there but we’ve been given the best by our customers and successfully tested it out to find which was best. Some recipes on the internet claim they can remove 95-99% of Tylenol and leave nearly pure Oxycodone within a 2-4 hour timeframe. It cannot be done in less than 3-4 days!<br /><br />What you are going to need to start:<br />1)&nbsp; &nbsp;20 Percocet, Codeine, or Vicodin&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2)&nbsp; &nbsp;Coffee filters and someone to hold them in place<br />3)&nbsp; &nbsp;About 2- 2 liter bottles of water<br />4)&nbsp; &nbsp;2 containers to hold the fluid like an water/ice tea pitcher.<br />5)&nbsp; &nbsp;Alpine Apple Cider Mix in those envelopes or Crystal Light Lemonade<br />6)&nbsp; &nbsp;A refrigerator, the mixture needs to sit in the fridge during the 72-96 hour process.<br />7)&nbsp; &nbsp;Patience approx. 3-4 days worth<br /><br /><br />Step 1: Crush, smash, or place 20-25 Percocet in blender for 2 seconds.&nbsp; DO NOT blend then to fine powered<br /><br />Step 2: Mix that with 1.5-2 liters of warm water (NOT BOILING WATER*).<br />&nbsp;*If you put boiling water in the mixture it worthless. Toss it, heat is does bad things to Oxycodone.<br />Make sure the water is the temperature of the hot water in about warm as water from your faucet, not hot enough to scold you.<br />Step 3: Chill that mixture in the fridge for at least 24-30 hours. Do not shake that mix, let the white stuff fall to the bottom and separate during this period.<br />**Notice the crap on the bottom of the pitcher<br />Step 4: Pour that mixture into a water pitcher, making sure you aren’t pouring the whitish substance on the bottom. You will see some chalky white stuff on the bottom of the container. Some people offering 4 hour recipes believe this is the acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol, or APAP)- it isn’t! That is corn starch used to bind tablets.&nbsp; The cloudy stuff on top of that chalky stuff is the Tylenol and you need to make sure you don’t transfer that into the next pitcher when you are pouring it into another container- toss it.<br />Step 5: After you poured the clearer stuff on the top into a new water pitcher stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons of Alpine Cider Mix or 1 Teaspoon of Lemon Crystal Light.&nbsp; Those two acidic drinks have large amount of Soda Ash and Lime to clarify their drink mixes.&nbsp; It will cause the remaining acetaminophen to bind up and fall down to the bottom of the pitcher.<br />Step 6: Put it back in the fridge and wait 24-36 hours again for the substance to self filter.<br />Step 7:&nbsp; Move the mixture to a new picture.&nbsp; It should be clear enough to see through, and be slightly tinted. Again toss the cloudy stuff on the bottom out.<br />Step 8: If you made sure to follow the first 7 steps carefully, you won’t need to filter anything because it should be clear and filtered itself during the unbinding process. Just to be safe, run that mix through a coffee filter. <br /><br /><br />After trying this a few times move on to your Cold Water Extraction Ph.D.- which is slightly heating that mixture for 12-24 hours until you’ve condense most of the water out.<br /><br />This step should not be handled by novices as you are gambling with a lot time and finished product.<br /><br />Step 8 (the Ph.D.) if you feel that you are indeed mastered this, then and only then try your hand at extracting water from the mixture and making a powerful tonic that fits nicely into a flask or shotglass.&nbsp; What is very important to remember here is heat does bad things to oxycodone and can make the mixture less potent or brownish if done incorrectly.<br /><br />Carefully place the finished batch into a pot (like a spaghetti pot) and genteelly heat.&nbsp; NEVER BRING TO A BOIL OR SIMMER. Gas stoves are notoriously bad from this, a crock pot or rice cooker with a “keep warm” option is idea.&nbsp; Electric stoves work also well too, but make sure that the fluid always remains warm or hot to the touch but no heat bubbles form in the pan.&nbsp; Over the next 12-24 hour period you should be able to reduce the amount of water by ½ to ¼, or even 1/8 of the original batch. This is some potent stuff so be very careful about chugging or gulping the entire mixture as each time you swallow can be equivalent to taking a 20 or 40 mg oxycodone tablet (depending how many Percocet you started the process with.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to cut the recipe in half if you want to experiment with 10 tablets and 1 liter of water.<br /><br />Have fun.

Not when there are so many other opiate/opioid options. Have never done any of the pills mentioned yet, so can&#039;t really comment. The price of Oxy on SR is staggering though, £10 + for 15mg. Not the most affordable option. <br />BTW, can you get hydrocodone/vicodin in pure form, without additives? Only ones i&#039;ve seen on SR had other substances in them. Is the brand Vicodin in pure form?

Again toss the cloudy stuff on the bottom out.<br />Step 8: If you made sure to follow the first 7 steps carefully, you won’t need to filter anything because it should be clear and filtered itself during the unbinding process. Just to be safe, run that mix through a coffee filter. <br /><br /><br />After trying this a few times move on to your Cold Water Extraction Ph.D.- which is slightly heating that mixture for 12-24 hours until you’ve condense most of the water out.<br /><br />This step should not be handled by novices as you are gambling with a lot time and finished product.<br /><br />Step 8 (the Ph.D.) if you feel that you are indeed mastered this, then and only then try your hand at extracting water from the mixture and making a powerful tonic that fits nicely into a flask or shotglass.&nbsp; What is very important to remember here is heat does bad things to oxycodone and can make the mixture less potent or brownish if done incorrectly.<br /><br />Carefully place the finished batch into a pot (like a spaghetti pot) and genteelly heat.&nbsp; NEVER BRING TO A BOIL OR SIMMER. Gas stoves are notoriously bad from this, a crock pot or rice cooker with a “keep warm” option is idea.&nbsp; Electric stoves work also well too, but make sure that the fluid always remains warm or hot to the touch but no heat bubbles form in the pan.&nbsp; Over the next 12-24 hour period you should be able to reduce the amount of water by ½ to ¼, or even 1/8 of the original batch. This is some potent stuff so be very careful about chugging or gulping the entire mixture as each time you swallow can be equivalent to taking a 20 or 40 mg oxycodone tablet (depending how many Percocet you started the process with.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to cut the recipe in half if you want to experiment with 10 tablets and 1 liter of water.<br /><br />Have fun. Be Safe.<br /><br />PureO<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great info PureOBrad!&nbsp; 8) I really don&#039;t know if i&#039;ve got the patience though! Not when there are so many other opiate/opioid options. Have never done any of the pills mentioned yet, so can&#039;t really comment. The price of Oxy on SR is staggering though, £10 + for 15mg. Not the most affordable option. <br />BTW, can you get hydrocodone/vicodin in pure form, without additives? Only ones i&#039;ve seen on SR had other substances in them. Is the brand Vicodin in pure form?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As for the CWE, all I can tell you is it works.&nbsp; Even the worse CWE should remove 90% of the acetaminophen from narcotic meds, while the best will remove nearly all of it.&nbsp; It can take a few minutes when you get the hang of it. <br /><br />I should preface things by saying we don&#039;t take new customers and ( nor have we for 9 months) but do have associate vendors who charge the same rate as we do. That said we&#039;ve been selling 5mg Percocet price averaging $3 +SR fees when purchasing bulk and go up the fewer ordered.<br /><br />When customers buy small amounts for most vendors the packing, tracking, shipping and overall time spent is the same whether it is 50 or 500. With every 10 orders coming in another employee is needed to help co-ordinate the shipping and logistics- mind you these are employees for life!! No one is going to fire them so that becomes a big commitment. <br /><br />If you want better rates on SR just be prepared to buy bulk and order once every 6 months rather than place weekly or monthly orders.&nbsp; I am sure you&#039;ll be able to buy those meds at a fraction of what you are paying for them now.
