				I have been considering purchasing a gram of coke from Silk Road for quite some time now. I have only done coke a few times in my life, and I was not impressed with the results either time. Just made me feel like hyper and jittery. I&#039;m assuming this is because I got less than stellar product. From what I hear, the cocaine on SR is as pure as it can be, and isn&#039;t cut with other things like most street coke is. I was considering buying from lloydsbrothers who seems to be one of the top coke vendors. However, 180 dollars is a lot of money for a gram. One of my friends can get some for 50 a gram in the city, which is apparantly a really good price. So, is the &quot;high quality cocaine&quot; that vendors are selling really that much better than the street stuff? Is it worth the steep price? let me know

				From what I gather, the purity here is usually pretty decent (although some vendors carry significantly worse product), judging by the purity test thread.&nbsp; You should look into that.&nbsp; Prices here are generally much worse than the street, enough so that most people who like coke don&#039;t find it worthwhile buying on the road.

				I&#039;ve bought cocaine from 3 vendors on SR.&nbsp; I was disappointed in all three.&nbsp; Of course I am comparing with cocaine from the 70&#039;s, which was amazing.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t done coke in about 30 years, until I discovered SR and found anything I wanted was available.&nbsp; So, what passes for cocaine these days isn&#039;t really worth it to me.&nbsp; However, if you are willing to purchase from overseas (I wasn&#039;t), I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with lloydsbrothers or Bungie.&nbsp; Their reviews are so outstanding that if their coke is not great, then nothing available is.&nbsp; I agree that prices are ridiculous, but if you have the money good coke is great.&nbsp; I recommend having some heroin on hand also.&nbsp; It is the perfect antidote for the comedown from coke.&nbsp;

				As a very occasional user, the short answer is: Yes. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done cocaine only a handful of times, and I felt just like you; it was less than stellar. Sometimes you&#039;d have to snort like 5-10 lines to get a really good &quot;feeling&quot;, but it&#039;d hurt to snort, and would be accompanied by a slew of other hyped up feelings that are nonexistent in pure cocaine. Then afterwards you&#039;d feel like shit and wonder why you even paid to feel that way. <br /><br />I saw the prices on SR and laughed. They were/are ridiculous in comparison to the stuff I could find on the streets. A few months went by, and I continued to read experiences from the cocaine thread. Vendors had gotten European lab testing done on their cocaine, and this gave you the power to know exactly what is in your cocaine. Vendors now have cocaine that is 100% pure, and others that are in the high 90%&#039;s. I recently went with Bungee54 who has 98.7% pure cocaine w/ no cuts and it really is completely different than street coke. <br /><br />A gram on the street will last a night if you&#039;re lucky, but I can stretch grams from SR for 2-3 weeks. The potency of pure cocaine lets a gram go a long way, and you don&#039;t have to snort as much for the effect. The come down is mild and just brings you back to baseline. The high peaks for about 45 minutes and lasts for like an hour and a half or longer. <br /><br />So yes, if you&#039;re curious and don&#039;t mind paying to know what&#039;s in your coke, then it&#039;s completely worth it.

				If you really want to see if its worth it, buy that $50 gram from your friend and buy a gram from SR. Do an acetone wash on both and see how much cocaine each one yields. It&#039;s likely the SR gram will have more, but the point is to see the quality to price ratio. So if the SR gram cost you $100 and yielded over twice the amount of washed coke than your local coke, it&#039;s worth it. Of course, this also depends on if you want that coke tonight or you can wait a few days.

				I am new in here and have ordered coke, not tried bungees yet (need more transactions ;)) but the product I got from FrankMatthews was definitely worth it. A lot better than the chopped up shit I can buy locally and at decent prices to. I have even compared the products, texture, smell, color, taste and of course the effects ;) all better.<br />I definitely recommend u try it from SR. I know I wasn&#039;t disappointed.

				For a once in a while user, fuck yes. <br /><br />I bought from BTP whatever his name is on the road. like $10 per point and god damn it was probably the most pure cocaine I&#039;ve ever done. No real comedown, amazing to IV....I started with snorting some tiny lines and it was the best euphoric rush I&#039;ve ever gotten from coke.<br /><br />If you&#039;re gonna buy drugs, be a fuckin&#039; baller and buy some expensive and great cocaine lol
