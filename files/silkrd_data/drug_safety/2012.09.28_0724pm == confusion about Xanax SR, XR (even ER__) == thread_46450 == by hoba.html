				I&#039;ve heard many contradicting opinions about how to defeat the time release mechanism of these pills.<br />I can only speak for myself, crushing and parachuting them works for me fine.<br />Since Pfizer doesn&#039;t make 2mg instants, ( the&nbsp; bigger , the better ) and I don&#039;t trust aftermarket stuff, that&#039;s how I do it.<br />There is also a more radical way: dissolve the crushed pill in&nbsp; a small amount of alcohol (preferably vodka for it&#039;s purity, about half a shot) stir it until completely dissolved, then add a little fruit juice and off you go! Go easy on the vodka though, because it will really knock you off your ass!<br />

				the best way to defeat any oral time release formulation is not alcohol, but if you think about it with common sense about how the pills are supposed to work.<br /><br />your stomach is acidic, so that is what causes the formulation to release the drug... therefore if you soak the pill in an acidic solution it will leech the drug into the solution - thereby allowing you to absorb it more quickly instead of slowly as its released from the formulation <br /><br />to maximize efficacy one should increase the surface area exposed to the acid, by crushing/cutting/grinding the pill as much as possible first. then add to an acidic drink, such as soda and citrus juices like lemonade or orange juice. allow to sit for at least a couple hours (for oxy OPs at least), stirring occasionally, to allow for the breakdown and release into solution. then drink and enjoy your now IR drug.<br /><br />this is important because the high has alot to do with how quickly the drug enters your bloodstream - increasing the peak plasma concentrations forces more across the blood brain barrier due to concentration gradients and equilibrium effects, which means more potent effects.&nbsp; i am just assuming this will work with xanax, i have never heard of extended release formulations of benzos, this method was originally intended to bypass the new oxycodone OP pills which dont release the entire dose if taken normally and take so long to break down you begin to metabolize and decrease plasma concentrations before you even absorb enough to really achieve the desired effects<br />

				Well, I usually crush and parachute them&nbsp; , but thank you for the info, I&#039;ll definitely give it a try.

				Why would you want to those slow release tablets in a market where normal, &#039;instant&#039; delivery tablets are so commonly available?<br /><br />If you had to turn a slow release tablet into fast release, i&#039;d probably grind it down in a pestle and mortar, dissolve the remaining power in a shot of vodka (alcohol is a decent solvent for most benzo&#039;s) and then drink the result as a shot. In case of xanax the result will be rather bitter in taste though, so it might be wise to have something sweet like chocolate cookies at hand to get rid of the taste (it sort of clings to the inside of your mouth, a glass of water doesnt help too much).

				A half shot of vodka works best for me as a solvent.It&nbsp; improves the effects.

				The alcohol is certainly synergistic when it comes to sedative effects. <br /><br />Simply crushing the tablets alone isn&#039;t usually all that effective: the time release mechanism works by incorporating the medication in very small pieces encased in layers of fatty acids and such. Crushing the tablet will not have that much effect on that despite popular believe. Dissolving the tablets, however, will completely remove this release mechanism. <br /><br />As benzo&#039;s are generally poorly soluble in water, ethanol is a preferred solvent since it its widely available and not that dangerous in small amounts. <br /><br />Extraction using other solvents will also be effective, but you would need to get rid of those solvents before ingesting the drug - you don&#039;t want to be ingesting something like acetone or thf, despite them being good solvents.
