				I&#039;m very experienced with both LSD and mushrooms but have never had the opportunity to try mescaline.&nbsp; It&#039;s at the top of my wish list but it&#039;s just not available.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering trying some of GammaGoblin&#039;s synthetic mescaline hcl.&nbsp; I&#039;m around 6ft tall and 260lbs.&nbsp; Do you think 500mgs is a good dose for an experienced tripper of this size?&nbsp; Would it be mild or mind blowing?

				I&#039;m not sure how body size effects mescaline dosage, so I&#039;d look into that a little more.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had the chance to do mescaline, always wanted to though. My plan, should I ever get ahold of a gram is to eat 500mg of it. I&#039;ve heard that should be pretty mindblowing. I know Shulgin&#039;s first experience was with 400mg, and it was pretty awesome. You should look up his experience report!

				I&#039;ve had a 12&quot; San Pedro and I can say eating that disgusting thing was not worth it. Anyone should try the very easy mescaline extraction if you can find the cactus locally. (Very common ornamental cactus.)

				Yep, gardening and landscaping store has a 4&#039; san pedro for $100. With its 4 arms&nbsp; that&#039;s 16 ft and should come out to about ~32 doses if all is well. Both San Pedro and Peruvian Torch are legal cacti with acceptable levels of mescaline. San Pedro is much more common in nurseries though.

				*Starts driving to a nursery* <br /><br />Do you have any recommended method of extraction? I&#039;ve looked into it a little before, and acid/base seems to be the best way. Is there a particular guide you would follow?<br /><br />Thanks for all the help! My consciousness thanks you :P

				Careful when asking the nurseries about San Pedro. My local nursery was well aware of their psychoactive properties LOL. Learn for yourself how to differentiate the cacti. <br /><br />Here is a good cactus ID guide: https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=6935<br /><br />Good luck and happy tripping,<br /><br />weedsaves<br />

				How much San Pedro did you consume? Crap is so disgusting the hardest part was eating enough. That is why extraction is the only real way. I PM&#039;d stolea2269 an extraction, have fun.
