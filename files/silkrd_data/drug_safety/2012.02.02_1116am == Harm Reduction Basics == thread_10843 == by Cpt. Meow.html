				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Start with such a low amount of substance that you shouldn&#039;t even be able to feel it. Perhaps the threshold dose, or even a little less. If you still feel it, you are either sensitive or possibly allergic and you know to be careful with it. Some people have acute allergic reactions to drugs the first time they use them, this leads to a small amount of deaths when people who are allergic start with a standard dose. If you are allergic and take a very small dose, you will likely be able to feel it still in addition to reducing your chance of death substantially.<br /><br />2. Always test drugs with reagents. This can not confirm what a drug is, but it can confirm what a drug is not. Reagent testing drugs saves lives. Even legitimate vendors have sent out bunk batches because they didn&#039;t test them. There have been several cases where people using reagents to test their drugs positively saved their lives, and there have been even more cases where people would not have died had they used reagents to test their drugs.<br /><br />3. Always weigh out your doses, eyeballing is not an accurate form of measurement. Some drugs this is an absolute requirement for, others it is just a good idea.<br /><br />4. It is a good idea to not use a lot of a research chemical. The long term effects are not known, and in many cases the more you use of a drug the higher the chances of being effected by negative effects.<br /><br />5. If you use addictive drugs, it is a good idea to make a decision to use a maximum amount in a given time frame while you are still sober, and perhaps even to have a non-using friend hold your stash and not let you have more than you set for yourself in a given time frame. Some drugs are pretty damn addictive and result in a strong desire to use more immediately after the high wears off. If you binge on drugs, the chances of negative effects grow exponentially. Most recreational drugs are pretty safe, even addictive ones, but what is not nearly as safe is binging on drugs.<br /><br />6. Even if you know you are not allergic to a given substance, and are more or less sure that it is what you think it is, it is a good idea to start with a low dose and work your way up. This is particularly true of street drugs where the purity difference between two batches can vary tremendously. Almost all overdose deaths are the result of the variance in purity of drugs.<br /><br />7. If you are using a new drug for the first time or a larger amount than you are used to, it is a&nbsp; good idea to have a sober trip sitter present.<br /><br />8. If you are using psychedelics, it is a very good idea to keep a few tabs of your favorite benzo (valium, xanax, etc) on hand, if you start to have a bad trip taking a benzo has a high chance of ending it. Merely knowing that you have access to drugs that can end your bad trip will make it less likely for you to have a bad trip in the first place. Anti psychotics do an even better job of ending bad trips, but I am not exactly sure how safe it is to use them to abort trips, and in the majority of cases a benzo is enough (a benzo will greatly reduce the mental aspects of the trip and calm you down but wont have much effect on the visuals, an anti psychotic will entirely abort the trip).<br /><br />9. Don&#039;t mix downers. I know of several people who died simply by snorting ketamine and having a few beers. I know of people who died just by mixing benzos with a few alcoholic drinks. Mixing downers can fucking kill you.<br /><br />10. Don&#039;t mix drugs unless you know it is a safe combination. It is generally a bad idea to mix research chemicals. It is always a bad idea to mix alcohol with anything that isn&#039;t a soft drug. Some mixes are okay though, for example LSD and MDMA. Mixing soft drugs that are not downers or experimental is usually fine.<br /><br />11. Remember set and setting if you use psychedelics. If you are in a bad mindset, taking psychedelics will likely make it worse. If you are in a bad setting, taking psychedelics will have an increased risk of causing you to have a bad trip. It is generally best to use psychedelics in a familiar setting, with a few close friends. Music also has a substantial effect on the high of psychedelics.<br /><br />12. Don&#039;t mix MDMA with other stimulants, this can greatly increase neurotoxicity.<br /><br />13. Don&#039;t binge on MDMA and try not to use it multiple days in a row. It is best if you allow at least three weeks to pass between MDMA sessions. Using 5-HTP after MDMA is thought to help stabilize serotonin levels. The more you use MDMA the less effects you will get from it, try to get the most out of it the first few times you use it.<br /><br />14. If you use MDMA, stay hydrated and cool. If you dance at least take some time to rest every now and then and make sure to drink enough water but not too much either.<br /><br />15. Vaporizers and water pipes can greatly reduce the amount of tar that will enter your lungs from smoking weed, and using them is the suggested method of smoking. Another even better option is to make food and eat it, but most people like to smoke.<br /><br />16. If you have a family history of mental illness, schizophrenia in particular, you should probably avoid using psychedelics including marijuana. There is substantial evidence that using psychedelics including marijuana can cause early onset mental illness in those who are predisposed. This isn&#039;t to say that psychedelics will cause you to have schizophrenia, but they may cause you to have schizophrenia at a younger age than you otherwise would.<br /><br />17. Don&#039;t share needles, and if you absolutely have to (which you shouldn&#039;t anyway) try to sanitize them. There are various guides on the internet regarding how to attempt to sanitize a dirty needle. Notice the emphasis on attempt. Also don&#039;t share spoons, and if you must make sure to sanitize them also. Don&#039;t share any other injection equipment no matter what.<br /><br />18. If you sniff drugs, make sure to crush them into as fine of a powder as possible. Also, periodically spraying saline solution into your nose during sniffing sessions can reduce damage to your mucous membranes.<br /><br />19. Don&#039;t drive high. Various drugs affect driving skills to various degrees, but it is better to simply not drive high at all.<br /><br />20. Don&#039;t do anything while tripping that could result in death if you make a mistake or have distorted perceptions. Even crossing the street while you are peaking on a strong dose of a psychedelic or dissociative can be dangerous.<br /><br />21. Research if any prescription drugs you are on interact poorly with what you want to use. Mixing MAOI&#039;s with almost anything can kill you or cause severe problems. Mixing many anti-depressants with pretty much any recreational drug can cause risk of severe reactions. Mixing most anti-depressants with psychedelics tends to cause diminished effects, mixing with drugs like MDMA can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome significantly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Honestly they were all mentally unstable to begin with, so my advice is make sure you are in your right frame of mind, and have no history of mental illness before you embark on psychedelics.
