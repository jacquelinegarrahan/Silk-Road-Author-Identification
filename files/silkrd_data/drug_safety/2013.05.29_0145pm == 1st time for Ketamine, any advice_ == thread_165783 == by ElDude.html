				I&#039;ve decided I want to give ketamine a shot, so I&#039;ve recently purchased a gram from Symbiosis, advertised as S+ shards. I&#039;m going to be doing small amounts (bumps) the first time to avoid k holing, as I&#039;ve heard it can be a pretty overwhelming experience, and though I think of myself as a person who can handle drugs quite well, I don&#039;t really want to overdo it. <br />Since it&#039;ll be my first time I&#039;ll probably be staying home as well, with someone sober to help me out if needed.<br />Is there any more advice anyone could offer as far as doing ket goes? What kinds of things do other people enjoy doing while on it? How long to wait between doses?

				You have pretty much got it covered.<br />First time can be a little overwhelming if you haven&#039;t got someone about to reassure...<br />Just don&#039;t drink alcohol with it, and take it slowly, bump at a time... don&#039;t swallow the back drip - this is what fucks up the organs and bladder more. I followed that advice and it&#039;s proved to be good advice.<br /><br />Your right about not wanting to K hole too quickly as it can scare people off, and can put peeps off.<br />It also seems to change depending on what emotional state you are in. The more positive the better.<br /><br />I&#039;d also advise on cooking up the shards into powder if you can as it absorbs better into the nostril and doesnt screw up the nasal passage as much, or if your feeling gutsy, IM it....... amazing experience if your safe and clean. 1ml insulin needle, alcohol wipe and a filter and boooom. But best get used to K first.<br /><br />Plenty of info on cooking up K. Put it in a pan, with a little water, if its 1 gram of K then a couple of T spoons. Low to medium heat. slower cooking the better, it will start to bubble up and slowly turn to powder, as soon as it turns to white powder, take it off the heat and check its not damp, if it is, just hover it over the heat for a bit and then scrape it out with a card when the pan has cooled.<br /><br />Hope this has helped. Any other qu&#039;s feel free to ask, have done K&nbsp; for 4 yrs now<br /><br />

				Tolerance to ketamine seems to build up immediately after your first time and in my experience never goes back to baseline.<br /><br />I only used 40mg my first time and it was probably my best k trip.

How long to wait between doses? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If it&#039;s a good dose, then lying in your bed listening to electronic music/techno is what you&#039;re gonna want to be doing :) Even for doses that don&#039;t get you to the K-hole it&#039;s better to lie down.<br />If it&#039;s a small dose, you can use it to party, it makes you want to dance, a little like a low dose of DXM (but way better). It&#039;s a nice alternative to alcohol at this range, but with a nice mood lift and less side-effects.<br /><br />It&#039;s better to cook it, but if you can&#039;t you definitely have to thoroughly crush it, it hurts really bad if you don&#039;t and it doesn&#039;t get absorbed well, but cooking it is still better. IM or subcutaneous are the way to go though, you have no nasty drip which can be a distraction.<br /><br />For dosing, it&#039;s advisable to do one small bump in each nostril every 5 to 10 minutes until you feel you&#039;ve reached a comfortable level. When you know your dose you can take higher doses at once.

However remember that if you will not experience after a while a K-hole you will definitely not know what K is really about. It would be like using DMT without ever having a breakthrough. <br /><br />I know there are a lot of people that use K and never experienced a K-hole nor want to, but I really cannot understand what&#039;s the point. I would never have used K if not for that and personally when I used K it was always to experience that state. But maybe it is just that I&#039;m much more interested in exploring my consciousness than having &quot;a good time&quot;, for others it can be different; still I think they are missing out on a very important aspect of the drug by using it only as a party tool and nothing more (and in that case it becomes also a dangerous very addicting drug).

				Think it&#039;s already been said. But mixing alcohol and ketamine is asking for trouble if it is your first time.<br />Also be very careful mixing it with other depressants like benzos, you don&#039;t want to fuck your breathing.
