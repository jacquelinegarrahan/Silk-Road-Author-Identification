				Okay so I should have asked this before I did it, but since MDMA is soluble in solution and certain drinks have coloring in them I jumped ahead and just decided to do this.<br />Putting liquid food coloring in MDMA. <br />I have about 2gs of red, 2g of green, and 2g of blue mdma. I am wondering, though, if this can result in a degradation of the mdma?

				...If you dry it off afterwards, and it&#039;s just food coloring...probably not.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible, but I don&#039;t see it being at all likely.

				I&#039;m a little confused. You colored the MDMA with food coloring, right? Did you just put the crystals in a baggie with some food coloring and swirl it around? Did the crystals break down much?
