				Well not sure how epic it is considered here as there are some hard heads who might see this as a walk in the park.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have experience with LSD, Mushrooms, 2c-b &amp; i &amp; c, Ket, codiene, mephedrone, MXE&nbsp; etc&nbsp; I&#039;ve candy flipped before and used 2c-b &amp; mdma together<br /><br />So i am to a rad psy festival held out in the bush soon and am as excited about the DJ&#039;s and ocourse the wicked drugs supplied from this wonderful place.&nbsp; So i don&#039;t want to be a guy who od&#039;s or freaksout and gives drugs a bad rep but i want to enjoy myself as i have just finished a grueling year.<br /><br />There will be two main days of music and then a day of recovery afterwords... so two nights in total + recovery day.&nbsp; I am not going there exclusively to do drugs but i do have a bit of an epic plan and would appreciate some input.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I have:&nbsp; LSD, MDMA, 2c-b, MXE, etizolam and&nbsp; oxycontin, serquol (slow release).&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; I am not intent on usinf all of these but want the best combo for a great time.&nbsp; I will be staggering all of these and going for low doses of each as i know there is synergy between psychs and mdma.&nbsp; Also, i want to be able to socialise and help other het into the party vibe too!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br /><br />So,&nbsp; heres the plan:&nbsp; <br /><br />1pm:&nbsp; &nbsp;Oxy&nbsp; 10mg - Chewed<br /><br />5pm&nbsp; redoes Oxy&nbsp; 10mg<br /><br />8pm&nbsp; &nbsp;Lsd (about 130ug)<br /><br />11pm&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdma&nbsp; (&nbsp; 100mg)<br /><br />12.30am&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdma&nbsp; (100mg)<br /><br />3,00am&nbsp; &nbsp; 2c-b&nbsp; (10mg)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />7 or 8&nbsp; am&nbsp; &nbsp; Etizolam&nbsp; (depending on vibe and people with)&nbsp; If knackerd then take a serequol and sleep till 1pm or there about.<br /><br />1.30pm&nbsp; Breakfast<br /><br />2.00&nbsp; Wake up... See what i am in the mood for.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking MXE would be perfect.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would also have more LSD, 2c-b and oxy but thinking it may be a waste due to tolerance.<br /><br />What do you guys think?&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />&nbsp;Notice i halved most of the doses.&nbsp; Plus i am pretty experienced with getting into some pretty weird states of mind + i will have the Etizolam on hand if i start feeling its too much.<br /><br />

				That looks like you got 1 day planned out, And from the looks of things you&#039;ve got one epic candyflip planned with 2c-b to chase the MDMA...that sounds like a pretty damned good night to me on it&#039;s own, i&#039;m not sure how the 2c-b will do after dropping acid earlier in the night, I think it might just be wasted.&nbsp; I did 30mg 2c-b 3 days after a 3 tab acid trip (~200mic roughly) and got barely any effects, so you can give it a try but I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll get the desired results.<br /><br />If it were up to me (not a big opiate guy, so i&#039;d pass on those anyway), I&#039;d candyflip that night, probably do the MXE the day after or smoke weed during the day, then MDMA again at night.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a 4/7 night MDMA at a big week-long festival and every night was pretty fucking epic in my memory.&nbsp; Only 150mg +50mg booster per night, but you can definitely roll 2 nights in a row and have a good time, just make sure you have a nice long break after a binge like that.&nbsp; I also candyflipped one of those 4 nights and did acid another time during the day there.<br /><br />You should be fine overall, MDMA+LSD takes a lot to have a bad time because of that forced happiness from the M, and well...I can&#039;t say acid has ever given me a bad time in my life.&nbsp; Other than possibly wasting that 2c-b I&#039;d say you&#039;re good to go man.

				An experienced festival goer would recommend you save your acid till the last day&nbsp; ;) usually I&#039;m present for 3-5 day festivals but in two days I would go with:<br />Day 1: Start with Ket and as the sun goes down take mdma, in about 2 hours redose and keep going with little bumps of K, near the end of the night I generally have a wicked tolerance for the ket so I just bang it back with my camp mates and crash hard till day two.<br />Day 2: Start with a moderate dose of acid (100-150mg) and allow yourself to come up, about half way through the trip I double dose (when the night falls it&#039;s nice to pump up the visuals i.e lights, lazers, bass) I personally am not too fond of opiates+dancing. mostly just makes me want to sit around and thumbs up people walking by lol. But I would take them near the end of the night your final night to ease you into that much needed sleep&nbsp; :D
