				Hello, <br /><br />I want to order various LSD blotters for my own use, I have some doubts regarding the storage and transportation. For how long could I store it? Should it have some special conditions other than the common sense ones, like normal temperature and not letting the sun hit them. Does it has some sort of expiration date? Is it ok to carry a blotter in my wallet without any protection? <br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance

				Blotter will go through x-ray machines without a noticeable drop in potency, for longer than a day in the sun - I would suggest - doing a google.com search for your question because thousands of people just like you ask the same question every month.

				I&#039;ve stored LSD in a wallet unknowingly for about a month/ month, and a half, and it lost very little if any at all potency. <br /><br />The best way to store your blotters would be in a Dark Glass Amber Vial. If this is done you can keep it at room temp, in the light, Etc. <br />It will stay just fine as Dark Amber Jars are good for storing LSD (or) any chemical for years free of Oxygen, Heat, Light, H20. Etc.<br /><br />Also there are a number of thread started on this topic already, and well written storage procedures to follow exactly like this one. <br />Anyway end of my rambling, and I hope all goes well with your plans for storing your LSD blotter. Always a good idea to store some tabs away. : )<br /><br />

				It sure is. Thanks for the answers, I&#039;m looking more into it right now, finally I got the time. Only SR though, I have very little trust for most open internet answers.

				LSD is surprisingly very durable.&nbsp; You&#039;ll want it in a cool space with no light exposure if you&#039;re REALLY worried about it.&nbsp; I normally keep mine in a special pouch that doesn&#039;t get much special treatment.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had paper get wet before and be just as effective, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend putting it at risk on that (I was camping lol)
