That&#039;s my dream job!<br /><br />While I don&#039;t smoke synthetics, my cousin who is on probation and is tested frequently has been trying several kinds of the the past year and a half. He has me try them but I haven&#039;t cared for them, and the ones I&#039;ve tried (K2, Blue Label, Serenity Now [cool name for Seinfeld fans], and High Fly) were nothing like a weed high. Most seem more of an energy type feeling, which I guess some people get from weed but I don&#039;t, even from pure Sativas. <br /><br />They make me light headed but it&#039;s hard to tell if it&#039;s the spice or because I cough up a long every time I take a hit. Remember when you were a kid and you chain smoked a few cigs or inhaled on a cigar and got that light headed feeling but your stomach hurt and it tastes like shit? That&#039;s about the extent of it.<br /><br />My cousin smokes it for the same sort of reason people trying to quit smoking cigs feel consuming bags of lollipops help them quit. The &#039;high&#039;, if you want to use that word, only lasts like 10 minutes. Plus the shit is way more expensive than weed.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone for any reason.

				I passed my tests with Jdubs (JWH-xxx) And I loved them. Made my own blend and mixed it like I wanted it to kick in. <br />Just google in the clearnet there are tons of reports and howtos.<br /><br />But beware of them being chems. And there is something like &quot;too much&quot;, unlike the nature thing.

				My buddy just lost his job for smoking weed, so he switched to this fake stuff called &quot;kush&quot; lol go figure. I smoked a blunt of that shit to the dome and I was fucked up beyond belief. I just wanted it to end. lol but if you smoke half a blunt of it its not that bad. I don&#039;t know about the synthetic shit on here though, never tried it.

				When K2 first came out, it had a descent weed-like &quot;high&quot; - &quot;high&quot; used loosely (it sure wasn&#039;t Amsterdam weed, but what is?). I&#039;ve had a bad reaction a couple of times (B in the 130/155, HR &gt;140). In a war this is norm, but sitting at home in a rocking chair ain&#039;t. Stick to the natural stuff.
