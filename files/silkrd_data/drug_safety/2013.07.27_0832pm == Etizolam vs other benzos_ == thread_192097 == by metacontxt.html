				I don&#039;t mind the occasional benzo, either to put me to sleep in a higher dose or to chill out a bit at a lower dose. However, I have to say that I&#039;ve noticed in myself even irregular alprazolam (Xanax) use causes cognitive issues - a temporary, slight but noticeable impairment of short term memory, mainly. I don&#039;t like that. At all.<br /><br />So I heard about this benzo analog Etizolam, which (according to its wiki site) does not have the cognitive impairment side effects of conventional benzos. Its half life is about the same as alprazolam and is of similar potency. Sounds like a good substitute. Who&#039;s tried Etizolam, and if so do you agree?<br /><br />Before anyone starts schooling me :) I&#039;m well aware of the dangers of benzo addiction and the often horrendous withdrawal process, so when I say occasional, I mean occasional. Max twice a week, usually less.<br /><br />Thankyee kindly for any assistance and expertise you can provide, good denizens of SR!

				Etizolam at high enough doses will cause some confusion, forgetfullness etc... especially to a low tolerance individual. I did find that Etizolam appears to be less physically addicting then many other benzos. However, I have also heard of individuals taking insane amounts.<br /><br />Is it a suitable substitute for Xanax? That is a tough one to answer. First, everyone reacts to medication differently so really it cannot be answered. Would I say it replaces xanax&#039;s efficiency for breakthrough or sudden panic attacks? No. Is it a suitable substance for sleep, comedowns or to lower anxiety... maybe. It is a pretty short acting benzo, the majority of the &quot;effects&quot; appear to be over in about 3ish hours, yet it stays in your system for a bit longer. This has caused some individuals to repeat dose which leads to blackout. <br /><br />And it is good you are aware about benzo dependency. Very possibly the worst substance to cold turkey from, especially when it comes to danger profile.

				Actually, I haven&#039;t been using Xanax all that long. I personally don&#039;t see what all the fuss is about. It knocks you out, sure. Even in small doses (half a mg) it makes me a bit fatigued and yawny. Not much fun if not combined with anything else. <br /><br />Prob my favourite benzo is bromazepam. It&#039;s got a silky French subtley other benzos lack...but I started liking it a bit too much at the start of the year and, realising an early stage of dependence, I tapered off sharply and easily (I guess I was lucky), never to return to that saucy French lady and with a renewed respect for the addictive power of benzos. <br /><br />:)

				Yes I found Bromazepam an under-rated benzo. Was doing loads of different benzos then though, plus on methadone, so memories of the different qualities is hazy. Clonazepam was my favorite.&nbsp; ;)<br />Etizaolam sounds worth a pop though. Wondered when they&#039;d start coming up with non-stimulant/non-psychedelic RC&#039;s.&nbsp; 8)

				Yeah, you don&#039;t notice bromazepam&#039;s pleasures at first. They&#039;re subtle. After a couple of times using it, you start to notice ... not exactly sure how to describe this ... a certain slight silkiness in your joints? Some kind of warmth? When I took it to sleep, I would take say 18mg which would be enough to knock me out good when I was ready to go, but I used to deliberately stay conscious for 15 or 20 mins before allowing myself to drift off to enjoy the floaty ride. Bromazepam lets you do that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have anxiety problems, but a small dose of Bromazepam was also great social lubricant, I found. Much more so than Xanax, which as I mentioned above just makes me yawn even in very small doses.

Xanax was mainly developed as a drug to alleviate anxiety without putting the user to sleep in the process, and that is pretty much what it does at normal doses.<br /><br />Bromazepam has a stronger sedative side at higher doses, making it more suitable as a sleep aid or come down drug compared to alprazolam at equally effective doses. You should be careful with it when combining it with alcohol, as bromazepam poses are larger risk of respiratory depression when compared to most benzo&#039;s. <br /><br />In a way it is the opposite end of the spectrum compared to etizolam which has very little chance of&nbsp; ending&nbsp; badly even when combined with a moderate amount of alcohol.

				Hey Ben<br /><br />Funny because that&#039;s the opposite reaction I get to Xanax. Even small doses can make me nod off. 2mg easily knocks me out. Whereas I could take up to 36mg of bromazepam and still remain awake if that&#039;s what I wanted. The thing I don&#039;t get is why so many people love Xanax as a recreational drug. I don&#039;t find it pleasurable in the slightest, as opposed to the classical benzos. It works great as a sleep aid, I don&#039;t use it for fun. So I am happy to give etizolam a go, not especially interested in its recreational properties.

				That&#039;s the other thing about Xanax I keep hearing from everyone - its super fast onset. However I haven&#039;t noticed that it starts getting to work on my CNS significantly faster than any other benzo that I&#039;ve tried. <br /><br />Zip - give the bro a go if you can :) I found that I didn&#039;t notice its pleasantness until after a couple of times using it; it&#039;s subtle. Of course your mileage may vary. Benzos are complex beasts indeed.<br /><br />PS. Holy shit Bruce, that&#039;s a long list!

				I could never see why Xanax was so popular when I tried it, but was on methadone ATT, so maybe I was missing the sedative qualities. I prefer lorazepam as a short-acting benzo. Midazolam is quite interesting. Ultra short-acting, used as a surgical drug apparently, but not a drug to be taken lightly.<br />

On an empty stomach the onset time of xanax is not much better compared to valium, but for both it is rapid. If you have some fats in your stomach, valium may absorb more slowly because it will dissolve in the fat rather than be taken through the intestinal wall right away, giving xanax a bit of a speed advantage.<br /><br />The slowest substances are those that require a conversion step in the liver. This also plays a role with valium: It is active itself, but its metabolites also are. This could make the onset of action a bit more gradual, but as it halflife is very long, taking one tablet a day will actually build up activity over a&nbsp; period of a week or so. <br /><br /><br />As for etizolam detecting positive on benzodiazepine tests: If it did, this would be a false-positive result as it is not chemically a benzodiazepine. Its effects may be similar, its molecular structure is too, but strictly i cannot be classified as a benzodiazepine. Obviously etizolam can be detected in blood and urine, but that test would have to be specific to etizolam, and as such not sensitive to true benzodiazepine class molecules.

				I finally gave etizolam a go a for the first time a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love the stuff. I had the same issues with alprazolam, which I have no desire for to ever use again daily. Clonazepam I like but still have minor cognitive issues (tolerable) but it&#039;s become a bit costly on here, even from abroad vendors. So I tried etizolam and I like it as much as clonazepam recreationally? maybe more (hard to decide just yet). But in terms of anxiolytic effects and aiding in sleep it&#039;s been wonderful. I&#039;ve lost interest in trying to find reasonably priced clonazepam and can&#039;t see myself changing preferance any time soon. Cognitive effects have been minimal so far and I find I&#039;m far less prone to benzo logic even at higher doses.

				Etizolam is not a bad substance by any standard if compared to benzodiazepines. Personally i&#039;ve found that it works reasonably well for anxiety, though it doesn&#039;t do much as a sleep aid for me at all. <br /><br />It is a bit difficult to explain the difference to anyone that does not suffer from anxiety. I think the chief difference between alprazolam and etiozam in anxiety is that alprazolam prevents the whole sensation of anxiety, while etizolam seems to limit the physiological response while the emotion is still there.<br /><br />Which effect is preferable is a personal choice. Alprazolam may, for example, greatly reduce the number of&nbsp; &#039;panic moments&#039; you experience, while etizolam will allow you to experience the emotional sensation of panic, but inhibit the bodies response to it. <br /><br />This is based solely on personal experience though, if you want the reality behind all of this, please read up on proper peer reviewed literature!
