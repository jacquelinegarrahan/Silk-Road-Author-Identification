				i&#039;ve been doing about 1g of k once a month for a year. I never leave the day feeling a hangover and feel that it is the same as a night drinking. You recover and carry on. However, the last time i did it i didn&#039;t break up my crystals. i feel like this was a bad thing and lead to a different experience. i wasn&#039;t sure if you should and it was the first time i got it like that. Should you be crushing it? Also, with a decently mild use of it does anyone know of any problems I should watch out for?

				I don&#039;t know about crushing the crystals or not will make a difference, I haven&#039;t used K yet. In my research online, lots of regular users get bladder pain or urinary problems.<br />Please do your own research about what you put in your body. Be safe! Lots of good info on (clearnet): http://www.erowid.org/

				snorting fat shards would hurt plus take forever to dissolve in your nasal cavity...<br /><br />with frequent use of any dissociative you should watch out for Olney&#039;s Lesions...

				Ketamine was the first drug that I sniffed in large amounts. At first I was kind of stupid and didn&#039;t realize that you need to crush things up. It royally fucked up my nose, talking blood faucet style. Crushing ketamine is a Good Thing. Using one gram a month is not going to have any significant negative effect on you IMO. I have used 1 gram an hour and am still alive and kicking ;).

				However I have gotten severe K pains to the point I felt as if I had been shot in the stomach, puked all over myself from the pain, destroyed my nose, and became temporarily similar to a schizophrenic hearing voices and having delusions. That is from heavy ketamine abuse though. Things don&#039;t start to go downhill until around gram five in a binge, so if you are at one gram a month I think you will be fine. Be grateful that you don&#039;t feel a compulsion to use what you have until it is gone, I wish I could keep twenty grams of k and use it over a year or two but unfortunately every time I try that I end up using it until it is gone. However, after some weeks all the damage heals up and I am back to normal, at least it seems that way to me :P.

				thanks for the feedback all. the reason i asked was because one bag i got was large crystals. i wasn&#039;t sure what to do with it so i sniffed as is. the experience was different. i also felt like the larger crystals were dissolving in my lungs long after the trip. this kind of freaked me out because i was having mild effects the next day. I guessed that it was a build up of larger crystals dissolving into my blood stream. Anywho, I crushed a couple doses a week later and that really released the anisthetic. It was a regular experience so I determined that you should crush to release the dose and not have a build up of crystals. That was just my experience though.

				This was something I found a little unsettling;<br /><br />http://www.haveigotaproblem.com/download/143/Ketamine-Bladder-Syndrome<br /><br />I knew about it but they always put in every gruesome detail for these kinds of things. The writing style is very choppy but we all have sleepless weekends, have fun exploring :)

				Crush that shit up dude! the idea of sniffing crystals seems crazy to me&nbsp; :o done it once with that proper sugar crystal-like k because i was in a forest and had no means of crushing it. always crush it man, ketamine is hard enough to break down in your stomach, it crystallizes heavily in your stomach normally, gotta be worse uncrushed.<br /><br />Or even better, cook it :) if you dont mind putting in the work, means waiting about 20 minutes longer but if ur interested just look up cooking ketamine. i personally love cooked k, some dont, it just turns the crystal into a very very fine powder, perfect for sniffing&nbsp; ;D
