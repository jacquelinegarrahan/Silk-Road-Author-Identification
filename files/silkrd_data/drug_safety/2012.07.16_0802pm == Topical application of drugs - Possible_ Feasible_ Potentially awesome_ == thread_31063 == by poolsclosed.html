				Hey forums, I&#039;ve got a pharmacological question for those who might know: I&#039;m looking to make topical gels/creams of different drugs, particularly MXE HCl but perhaps others. I have a lot of motivations for this, primarily for topical pain relief but also for potential interesting effects, especially when applied to certain parts of the body. An oral gel would also be interesting.<br /><br />There are a three main obstacles to the realization of this idea, primarily:<br />- How to create a gel or cream that is safe to use and cost effective<br />- How to add substances to the gel or cream, or in other words, how to ensure solubility<br />- How to make sure the substances can be absorbed through the skin (and identifying whether or not the ROA would be wasteful or not)<br /><br />There&#039;s also the question of whether topical application is even necessary at all. I have friends who suffer from aches and pains and I think such a product would be useful for them. I&#039;ve found MXE to be a great pain reliever and its anesthetic effects last for quite a while, so I think it might be beneficial. Might there be other substances which would be effective in this form as well?<br /><br />I found a neutral, non-active topical solution online at www.primordialperformance.com but I&#039;m not sure if it will allow MXE HCl to dissolve. My knowledge of chemistry is pretty basic. I do know that dissolving MXE in distilled water is pretty easy if the water is heated slightly (lukewarm at least).<br /><br />If the idea is no good, that&#039;s fine. I&#039;m just performing a bit of a thought experiment right now :)<br /><br />Of course, thank you in advance for your input.

				Very interesting idea. LSD is the only drug i can think of the works for sure. i would think that some type of chemical would be necessary to help absorption into the skin. let us know how the results turn out! I tried some MXE from TheEmporium from the UK and it was completely awesome. i had so much fun! but recently i tried some from a US vendor called Awakened and it made me feel horrible. Paranoia, no Euphoria. i have no idea whats up with it. im still trying to figure it out.

However, I like Awakened&#039;s MXE. To each his own :) thanks for the well-wishing.

				DMSO- but do it under sterile conditions and you had better trust the purity of what you&#039;re using, because it&#039;ll all absorb along with it. Also some materials may not be soluble in DMSO.

				I think topical MXE would be incredible! There would be so many possibilities opened up if this were to happen! :D It could help so many people, but I have no clue regarding the feasibility of it.

I searched &quot;cocaine dmso&quot; and didn&#039;t find anything but that would be an example of something that hypothetically could go wrong... well I&#039;ll have to tread carefully and see if I can develop a product that works. If it does, I&#039;ll be sure to share the recipe. In the meantime more advice is definitely welcome.

				I have read that DMSO, when used for transdermal drug administration, imparts a not-so-pleasant garlicky taste/smell in the mouth.&nbsp; So it&#039;s a real vibe killer when you break out the DMSO at parties.
