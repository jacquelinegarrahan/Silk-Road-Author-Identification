				I&#039;ve been taking Ritalin and a few other ADHD meds for a while now (usually 20mg/day of ritalin) to help me study. I&#039;ve basically self-diagnosed with ADHD, which I know is stupid, but the meds have genuinely helped.<br /><br />The problem is, if I&#039;m buying 28*20mgs per month, I can spend between 115 and 180 GBP per month, depending on who is selling it. That&#039;s a hell of alot of money,, especially for a student, and I won&#039;t be able to keep it up for much longer. I could get the meds cheaper through the British National Health Service (NHS), but unfortunately getting treatment for adult ADHD on the NHS is extremely difficult if the patient was not diagnosed in childhood (and that&#039;s not even mentioning the month- and even year-long waiting lists!).<br /><br />So, I&#039;m considering to switching to Ethylphenidate, seeing as it&#039;s cheap as chips and has similar effects. Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Safety? Health concerns? Will it be as effective as Ritalin?<br /><br />Also, I was thinking the best way to measure out a dosage (I don&#039;t have an accurate enough scale, and to get a trustworthy one you need to take out a loan) would be to dissolve a known quantity (ie. direct from the seller) into some sort of liquid and then use a measuring cup for doses? Eg. 1g dissolved in 1l of water and use a measuring cup to measure out a 20ml dose. Would this be the best way to go about it? Would ethylphenidate degrade faster when dissolved? Are there any other methodsof measuring out such a small dosage without extremely expensive scales?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />indignado

				Most people find that EPH is a terrible study aid and it actually hindered their concentration ability. It is a stimulant just not the right kind to help you study. Get some Modafinil or amphetamines.

Also, there&#039;s&nbsp; the price which is prohibitive, and also, I don&#039;t actually concentrate any better on Modafinil, I can just go longer without sleep without walking around like a zombie.

I&#039;d assumed that becuase it was chemically similar to Ritalin (methylphenidate), that it might be useful in the same way. But, I&#039;m currently waiting on some amphetamine as well as EPH, I guess I&#039;ll try them both out and see which is best, maybe even try a combo (can anyone think of any serious health problems with that?)

				EPH is very very vasoconstrictive, you will get limb pain etc.. I would not want to risk mixing it with anything in case it severely fucked me over.

				Based on some friends with ADHD, a lot of them that have tried crystal meth had great reactions. ADD people seem to love meth, cuz it makes them super focused, while having fun too(?)&nbsp; Plus, it&#039;s pretty affordable these days, with all the fire sales goin on in the SR meth section and all hah.<br /><br />Makes sense in a way, Adderall is amphetamine salts, pretty high up on the stimulant hierarchy. Above that you get dexedrine (i think), Vyvanse, Methamphetamine, then the newcomers known as bath salts. MDPV, Mephedrone, 4-MFA -- these are all bath salts, very potent, but definitely with its fans, whom describe it as Coke and Meth combined. Seven to 10 milligrams is all you need. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have ADD btw, so just relaying what I&#039;ve felt from the zeitgeist. :)

				try dextroamphetamine(adderal), or below threshold doses orally of methamphetamine, if used for actual adhd and not recreation.
