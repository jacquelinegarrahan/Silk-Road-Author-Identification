				Title: <strong>Gunpowder heroin?</strong><br />

				Greetings fellow humans!<br /><br />I&#039;ve had this little bag of heroin for a few weeks now and I&#039;m not sure how I should go about using it. The person I got it from called it &quot;gunpowder heroin&quot; and told me it&#039;s a different kind of heroin that&#039;s supposed to be much stronger than most heroin you would normally buy. I am not an avid enjoyer of heroin myself, the last time I used heroin was more than 1 year ago, so my tolerance is likely very low. <br /><br />My questions are:<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way to get the most out of what I have? (NOTE: I do NOT intend to IV it, I KNOW that&#039;s the best way to do it but I&#039;m not interested, I can&#039;t use a needle on myself unfortunately and I have no one else who can help me out.)<br /><br />&amp;<br /><br />How much of it is suitable for 1 dose? I am an adult human female, I weigh 112lbs., and as I said I have a very low opiate tolerance.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a picture of what I have, maybe someone can confirm or deny the claim that it&#039;s &quot;gunpowder heroin&quot;. It reeks of vinegar (which I know is a good thing) and is soft, almost like partially . I touched it with my fingers when I took the photo and it didn&#039;t stick to my fingers but it sticks to itself.<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/thfjp4qw9/full/<br /><br />Any advice is appreciated!<br /><br />XOXO<br />PM90

				&quot;Gunpowder heroin&quot; IS black tar heroin, in every single way except it&#039;s final appearance, which still isn&#039;t very different.<br />Basically, black tar from the Mexican cartels is mashed up into chunks and sold as &quot;gunpowder&quot;, in an attempt to make it seem like a different product than BTH.<br />In reality, they are the exact same thing.<br />As with BTH, quality varies dramatically, anywhere from 90%+ active alkaloids to completely bunk.<br /><br />So now addressing your questions directly:<br /><br />1)&quot;What&#039;s the best way to get the most out of what I have? &quot;<br /><br />I would highly suggest plugging. If you&#039;re not aware of this method, read my tutorial in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207873.15<br />No other method other than IV has a BA that comes even close<br /><br />2)&quot;How much of it is suitable for 1 dose? I am an adult human female, I weigh 112lbs., and as I said I have a very low opiate tolerance.&quot;<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, purity is EXTREMELY variable. Sometimes, BTH can be laced with fentanyl as well; an obscenely strong synthetic opioid that can make you OD quite easily.<br />Your best bet is to start off very small, with a dose &lt;5mg. If you feel absolutely nothing, try between 5-10 mg. If nothing again, push it up another 5mg and so on until you&#039;&#039;re finally satisfied with the effects you are getting.<br /><br />Make sure to space these doses 3 days apart at least if you want to avoid tolerance and addiction.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me any more questions if you&#039;d like, have fun and stay safe!
