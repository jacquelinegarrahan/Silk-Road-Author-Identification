				Hey,<br /><br />just had my first K experience yesterday, maybe you saw the... creative post about it ;)<br />I am a bit worried now because for the first time a substance from SR made me crave for it. It is like a siren&#039;s voice in my head: Snort me, snort me, I will be good to you.<br />What bothers me is: How much K is too much K? What is the minimum timespan between trips to NOT get addicted? I read some really horrible things about K withdrawal and I really don&#039;t want to play this game. At the moment I have a g at home, that looks like a lot of fun to me, and as long I don&#039;t start ordering ounces of it I should be good. Anyway, your opinions and experiences on this are really much appreciated.<br /><br />*update*<br /><br />Roughly four months passed now, I still have 1/2g left and kept book about my use. I always snort it.<br /><br />Some statistics:<br /><br />total amount of times used: 12<br />total amount of material used: 580mg<br /><br />average time-span between uses: 9 days<br />average amount of material used: 50mg<br />&nbsp;<br />numbers in parenthesis show the next value, if you remove longest and shortest time span, highest and lowest amount of material<br />shortest time span between uses: 3 days (7)<br />longest time span between uses: 16 (15)<br /><br />highest amount used 90mg (80)<br />lowest amount used 10mg (10)<br /><br />I read about the mind-blowing effect of ketamine on depression. My impression is, that I use K subconsciously to treat my depression. The cravings have gone so far, I stopped thinking about K. But from time to time I get the very obvious feeling I want to use K now. The last two or three experiences I was really tired when I used K and fell asleep about 30 minutes into the trip. My overall life-satisfaction has increased drastically. I lost a lot, if not all, social anxiety, I got a job in April with a really good perspective and I grew up a lot. I want a relationship now instead of just fucking around... All in all, I have a life now! I found new interests, started to work on long-term goals, job-wise as leisure-time wise. And I fulfill them. I learned to control my affection and I can delay things like playing computer games if I have more important things to do. To be honest, this text just developed because I was too bored playing my MMORPG ;)<br /><br />I play with the idea of ordering another g just to have some material at hand to treat any surprise-symptoms. I think I have no problem with K, but will monitor my usage closely.&nbsp; <br /><br />K might sound like a wonder drug now, but I changed a lot of my habits, worked hard on myself and had a tough time. You can follow my development in my other posts, about a year ago I was just a shadow of myself today. Allthouhg, used wisely, I think K can help you a lot to get back on track. It can wreck you though, without question, too.<br />&nbsp;

				I ordered a quarter of ketamine back in September from Silk. It was my first time encountering K. I didn&#039;t instantly fall in love with it, but once I decided to order some bulk to resell.... That&#039;s when I started developing a bit of a problem. I&#039;ve been off it for the last 2.5 weeks, but before that I was using K throughout the day. All through late November and early December, I was using quite a bit of ketamine. I ended up buying some vials from India and blowing through those. Then Marcel&#039;s S-iso I ordered 100gs and fucking ran through that selling and snorting. I sold all but a quarter of that 100gs. A week later, I was buying back grams from people I sold half ounces and ounces too. I just love the way I feel on K, whether it&#039;s a large dose or just bumps. I feel so inspired, creative, and personable.... And the K holes are just fucking magical. I got to the point where I blew a .3 line of racemic and barely felt shit. That&#039;s where I said, &quot;OK, breaktime!&quot;<br /><br />Some people get reaaaaally hooked on K. I&#039;m one of them. It&#039;s been hard not to because of money to be made and my hungry nose, but I&#039;ve been fighting the urge to make another order... I don&#039;t want to be one of those long term K users. Not a whole lot of research out there on longterm K effects, but there&#039;s definitely links to urinary and renal problems. <br /><br />It&#039;s definitely playing with fire man. You know yourself. Sounds like you know you should tread carefully here.

				I never understood how one can get addicted ti K ,<br />I think that you need to be the kind of person who can get addicted to alcohol to be in risk of developing a K addiction&nbsp; - or just be in general a person who gets easily addicted...<br /><br />* Just my personal View - don&#039;t take it a the absolute truth for everyone obviously, i realize different people react in a different way, just never got it why it got a name of such an addicting thing...&nbsp; :)

				Drinking more water seems like a good idea if you&#039;re going to play around a bit more. But be careful, it&#039;s not that healthy! I have only k-holed, so I have not much experience of small doses. I&#039;m a bit interested in more answers though. I wouldn&#039;t mind adding this to my semi regular stash.<br /><br />How often can you take ket and still don&#039;t risk any health?

				I think if you believe you might have a problem after 1 use you should proceed with EXTREME caution if at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />It causes serious physical harm when used regularly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been pretty careful with it.&nbsp; I really do enjoy it but I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; see myself using it regularly.

				Save your ketamine for what it&#039;s good for, major pain relief.<br /><br />K can be fun mixed with other drugs very rarely, like once or twice a year at most.<br />Ketamine has fucked up alot of people, <br />the NMDA receptors are a funny one as theyre involved in the whole Addiction/Reward system. (they are more or less the root)<br />Ketamine, whilst being a crap non-euphoric drug in itself, gradually tricks your brain into doing more and more and more. (Its cumulatively addictive. google &quot;ketamine addiction NMDA&quot;)<br />as tolerance builds, the higher dosages cause even more damage to your brain that eventually causes extreme de-realisation and depersonalisation.<br />people who over-use K don&#039;t really feel human anymore.<br />-this damage is called Olney&#039;s lesions. Basically lesions (like, HOLES) in an area of your brain. read on and check out the link.<br /><br />Heres a quote from <br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney%27s_lesions<br />&quot;The evidence is that ketamine and many other NMDA-receptor antagonists that have been tested in humans, cause an acute disturbance in neural circuitry that leads to psychotic manifestations. These same drugs cause the same disturbance in neural circuitry in rats and when we look at their brains we see evidence for physical neuronal injury. Since no one has looked at the brains of humans immediately after administering these drugs, we do not know whether the physical neuronal injury occurs.&quot;<br />—John Olney<br /><br />You&#039;re welcome to give me bad karma, but i&#039;ve seen K destroy too many great personalities

				K is one of these drugs that for some reason slips under the radar when people think of it as &#039;addictive&#039;, i have had a lot of experience with it and i have also had a lot of experience with friends who have become and are still very very addicted to it, mentally and now physically.<br />The problem with K is that it puts you in a completely different world, a world that you can still comfortably live in and also function from day to day, i still have a few friends who cannot go with sniffing at least 3-4 grams of the shit a day, they are mad paranoid messes and even think some of their best friends are undercover police at times.<br />Even i got addicted to it and i like to think that i am quite sensible when it comes to taking a suitable and controlled amount of narcotics, and as others have said it started off when i bulk bought a load to sell, instead of selling it all i ended up doing a bit here and a bit there and we all know what happens next.<br /><br />In conclusion i always warn people about the mental addictiveness of K because it can just take control of your mind so easily and make you believe you need more of it to go back into that safe world where nothing matters and all bad feelings are abolished. Personally i think if you are going to continue using it you limit yourself to just 1 gram every two weeks or so, its really not a drug you want to become dependent on and again it depends how much will power you have with yourself as well.<br /><br />Just be wary of it and like all other drugs treat it with a mass of respect, because if you let it, it will fuck you over.

				I had a very strange dream yesterday, in the afternoon: I basically dreamed about being intoxicated with K. I had the vertigo, the body buzz, everything. After waking up I felt a bit of relieve from my cravings, which I still have daily - after one use!<br /><br />I will keep the rest of the g I ordered from MarcelKetman, but I will treat it with utter respect. And I will not order that stuff on the road again, nor will I buy more from other sources or accept invitations from other people. Full stop.<br /><br />I primarily bought it to see if it had any valuable effects on my mood - yes it had. Long story short: After coming down I went out, gamed a girl and we fucked our brains out - no social anxiety, nothing. K helped a bit, as my long-term interest in the pick-up-arts did 10%K 90%PUA ;)<br /><br />While doing research on the road I found this:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa_L5BZzPDE<br /><br />A documentary about K, a bit yellow-pressy but very interesting and horrifying. Usually I am not easily black-mailed mentally but I had to stop watching during the part of the 2nd guy. He really fucked it up! I never want to be even close to where that guy got.<br /><br />When asking my question I was prepared for a lot of: &quot;If you feel like this now, just stop&quot;-answers. Thank you Kesser and PizzaBrain for sharing your experiences, you really added some good reason here.

				10%K 90%PUA<br /><br />what I actually did was pushing the limits on kino (non-sexual-touching to build trust and make kissing easier) and sexual innuendo, doing something illegal like K just made me feel like a badass - crossing the street with red traffic-lights on can do the same ;)<br /><br />I snorted maybe 5-10 mg bumps totaling at 70-80 mg. Take it easy at your first time, what I filtered from first time users was that K-holing on your first experience is usually a bad thing , not enjoyable because of the type of experience.

				Thanks Dopamin.<br /><br />Have you been doing &#039;game&#039; for a while now? Are you an approach machine?<br />I found the more I knew about that kind of stuff the less enthusiasm I had for going out and applying it. It&#039;s the old &#039;I wasn&#039;t sexist until I understood women&#039; thing.<br /><br />And thanks for the info. I&#039;m usually drawn to the more extreme end of these experiences, K-holes, LSD ego death, DMT break throughs. Maybe the reason is that my own life isn&#039;t exciting enough but it&#039;s these things that pique my interest. Whether I can handle them of course is an entirely different matter.

It was like being in a 56k modem.<br />This is the only type of music(electronic, no vocals) you could listen to on K I suppose, but I&#039;ve not tried others.<br /><br />I suppose its due to the fact that when we&#039;re dying and our external senses shut off, the last one to go is our hearing.<br />our eyes either close or shut off quickly, feelings over the body are numbed, but sound is hardwired into the brain, it&#039;s not like you can close your ears.<br />so with all your other senses nullified, the last remaining one becomes magnified as your only portal back into the real world..<br /><br />I decided to buco a gram of my own cause I don&#039;t like poncing drugs from others. esp if I have money. It was 25 a gram but I was so fucked up, I managed to knowingly count around 37.50 and then say to the dealer/runner &quot;I&#039;ve only got 37.xx, is that ok?&quot; and they said &quot;Yeah, that&#039;ll do. no problem&quot;&nbsp; - slimey cunt, eh?<br /><br />Another time I finished the rest of the bag in my bedroom and smoked some Northern lights bud on it. It became really psychedelic and colourful, like an 80s cartoon. I saw a goblin sitting beside my monitor for a second or two and when I looked at my hands I looked like a skeleton. Trying to enhance it a bit by doing more bumps didn&#039;t work because tolerance builds rapidly.<br /><br />My last time doing this was with a mate, After leaving him a line in a pub toilet he came out and I said &quot;whatever you do, don&#039;t swallow the drip&quot; and he said &quot;i already did..&quot;<br />&nbsp;-If you do this, it converts to Norketamine and is more potent but has extreme nauseating dizzying effects and the room spins for what seems like hours. (in reality its more like 50 mins)<br /><br />Anyhow, we got thrown out the pub and I had to walk the streets babysitting him for what seemed to me like 2 weeks. (about half hour) till we got to the bus station.<br />He thought he was stuck like it forever, lol.<br /><br />Never again unless its to have a K hole.<br /><br />Has anyone here tried DXM? It&#039;s something I&#039;ve always wanted to experiment with after having the Flu and taking a load of NightNurse capsules that gave me movie-like CEVs that were like vivid music videos.

				*Have you been doing &#039;game&#039; for a while now? Are you an approach machine?*<br /><br />It still depends on where I am and how the vibe is. I am not thus far into the game that I can reframe a whole social situation. Approaching people that are laughing and having fun is a whole different thing than day-gaming. I built some rep in my local bar, most of the barkeeps are my friends and I have access to the private areas there. That helps a lot ;) My day game is far from good :P<br /><br />LSD, MDMA and facing the troubles in my childhood made me a different man. If you love yourself and meet a lot of people it is impossible to not meet girls and get laid. If you know a bit of game that helps a lot but don&#039;t get lost in the details. <br />The most important things in the first five minutes are: act like you just have a quick question. show disinterest with body language, touch as soon as possible (shoulder, arm) and see how she reacts, if they pull away it was too much. Build trust and try again later. Never be sorry :)<br /><br />&nbsp;Check the girl out and decide if you like her or not. If yes, find a cause to move her away from her group (it is enough when you sit 5m from the group, but just the 2 of you) and then you can try to kiss her. Read something about last minute resistance, that will help her a lot later if you have sex.<br /><br />*And thanks for the info. I&#039;m usually drawn to the more extreme end of these experiences, K-holes, LSD ego death, DMT break throughs. Maybe the reason is that my own life isn&#039;t exciting enough but it&#039;s these things that pique my interest. Whether I can handle them of course is an entirely different matter.*<br /><br />Sounds to me like you are searching for your true self. I wish you all the best with that adventure :) Letting go and accepting things how they are, surrendering to your own weaknesses and inabilities will make life a lot more enjoyable for you.

				Ketamine is not addictive the same way as benzo&#039;s, alcohol, opiates, cocaine or anything like that that would be considered &quot;addictive&quot;. All those things eventually act as a social lubricant to help you &quot;fit in&quot; and &quot;feel normal&quot;<br /><br />What&#039;s addictive about ketamine is that it seduces you with it&#039;s illusion to bring you knowledge and spirituality. At least for me, I was never comfortable being around people on a lot of K, I found it to be almost the opposite of a social lubricant. Its like you get home and you go in your room and it doesn&#039;t last more than an hour so you&#039;re just like, damn ill try to get to a k hole real quick.<br /><br />So yeah, it will fuck you but from a different angle.

Its like you get home and you go in your room and it doesn&#039;t last more than an hour so you&#039;re just like, damn ill try to get to a k hole real quick.<br /><br />So yeah, it will fuck you but from a different angle. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Haha, nicely said. +1 :D

				how do you NOT swallow the drip? just try to let it build up in the back of your nose? spit it out? i&#039;ve never heard of this....<br /><br />that said, i only do bumps at a time and have never holed, so maybe i just haven&#039;t done enough to notice/be affected by a big drip.

				To be completely safe, I&#039;d say 2-3 weeks, although I know people that snort it every weekend and suffer no withdrawal from stopping cold turkey. I also recommend not taking extreme doses, as people get addicted to many illicit substances because of frequent use and high doses.

				I tried MXE around a year ago. While it was fun to lie down and listen to music, recalling memories as vivid as real life, I can&#039;t say it was a substance I could ever see become habit-forming. For those who have tried both, how does Ketamine differ from MXE, in terms of addiction?

				I&#039;ve heard MXE shouldn&#039;t be snorted but rather swallowed..?<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert(having never used it), MXE that is; but I&#039;ve swallowed the k drip without issue.

				Roughly four months passed now, I still have 1/2g left and kept book about my use. I always snort it.<br /><br />Some statistics:<br /><br />total amount of times used: 12<br />total amount of material used: 580mg<br /><br />average time-span between uses: 9 days<br />average amount of material used: 50mg<br />&nbsp;<br />numbers in parenthesis show the next value, if you remove longest and shortest time span, highest and lowest amount of material<br />shortest time span between uses: 3 days (7)<br />longest time span between uses: 16 (15)<br /><br />highest amount used 90mg (80)<br />lowest amount used 10mg (10)<br /><br />I read about the mind-blowing effect of ketamine on depression. My impression is, that I use K subconsciously to treat my depression. The cravings have gone so far, I stopped thinking about K. But from time to time I get the very obvious feeling I want to use K now. The last two or three experiences I was really tired when I used K and fell asleep about 30 minutes into the trip. My overall life-satisfaction has increased drastically. I lost a lot, if not all, social anxiety, I got a job in April with a really good perspective and I grew up a lot. I want a relationship now instead of just fucking around... All in all, I have a life now! I found new interests, started to work on long-term goals, job-wise as leisure-time wise. And I fulfill them. I learned to control my affection and I can delay things like playing computer games if I have more important things to do. To be honest, this text just developed because I was too bored playing my MMORPG ;)<br /><br />I play with the idea of ordering another g just to have some material at hand to treat any surprise-symptoms. I think I have no problem with K, but will monitor my usage closely.&nbsp; <br /><br />K might sound like a wonder drug now, but I changed a lot of my habits, worked hard on myself and had a tough time. You can follow my development in my other posts, about a year ago I was just a shadow of myself today. Allthouhg, used wisely, I think K can help you a lot to get back on track. It can wreck you though, without question, too.

				I know one of my favourite vendors stopped selling K because of this (which says something about the vendor, and the product), but &quot;siren song&quot; from your first hit?! It&#039;s long been the one substance I&#039;ve wanted to try but resisted. Gonna keep on resisting, for now.

Coming out of the 90s rave scene in the northeast K was everywhere and super cheap, i remember selling it for $25 a bottle and being amazed people would buy it at that price. It was always around and was so so cheap. so when i binged on it I binged. Days in the hole. When it started to get scarce and expensive i gave it up but saw alot of people who couldnt. i had a friend die from muscle popping K and driving into an overpass on the freeway. As I entered my 30s i heard the siren calling and decided to get a pack on the road. now as previously noted coke is my DOC so of course i snorted it, about 70-80mg. I found it to be a much more illuminating experience than when i was young. nice body buzz, music enjoyment amplified (Mainly Trap and D&amp;B), overall pleasant experience. Im even thinking of introducing my mate to it. I cant imagine anyone calling it addictive. its an easy on/off for me. Thats just me though. I dont know that one need resist, if you have a general sense of self control it should be easy on/ easy off for you too oldToby.
