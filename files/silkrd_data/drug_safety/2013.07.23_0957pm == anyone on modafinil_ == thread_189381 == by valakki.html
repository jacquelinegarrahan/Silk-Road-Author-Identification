				Hi<br />I need a good stim i can take regularly. <br />can i use modafinil for physical work? and also for playing instruments and socialization? I need physical and mental stimulation!<br />at the moment i use mdma.. my favorite stim. but serotonin depletion is a bitch. <br />also straight amps give me bloodpressure problems. so those are out of the question too.<br />no meth. maybe later...<br /><br />I really wanna try this one.<br />give me your experiences, ideas etc..<br />thanks!!Â°!!!<br /><br />

				Hey there! Yes! Modafinil! It is ITTTT!<br /><br />A couple months ago I first learned about this drug, and ordered it from a few different vendors on here. I&#039;ve to say, it was not what I expected. Blister caps, generic provigil modalert, are NOTT, I REPEAT, NOTT THE SAME AS MODAFINIL (generic for Provigil)<br /><br />What I got from the vendors seemed to be inactive. The first pill, I felt something, maybe because I wanted to, but the second and third, were not the same.<br /><br />I went to my doctor and after a battle she put me on MODAFINIL, (Provigil)<br /><br />I take it every day, sometimes twice daily. When I would be tired from working 12 hours, I now cannot sleep for another 6 and end up going to work on 3-4 hours of sleep the next day.<br /><br />All I can say is it is alertness in a pill.<br /><br />Yes, you can do physical activity, no problem. Simply knowing you are able to gives you the strength, and on modafinil, I can do anything.<br /><br />People call it the &quot;Limitless Movie Pill&quot; and though it is not exactly that, it is not far from it.<br /><br />My life has changed since taking REAL Provigil/Modafinil, and I encourage you to try it.

				I dunno.&nbsp; I got some Modafinil tabs to try, and they&#039;re a bit weird.&nbsp; I would go so far as to say they&#039;re not really a stimulant, they&#039;re an &#039;awakeness enhancer&#039;.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know there was a difference, but there absolutely is.&nbsp; Sometimes I get little pushes or &#039;feel good&#039; sensations if I take a whole tablet, but generally there&#039;s no energy or even real alertness in the drug - for me at least it just seems to stimulate the part of your brain that keeps you awake.&nbsp; In fact, I can actually feel the part of the brain its effecting, because that&#039;s the site where for example if I go to bed and it&#039;s not shutting down, I just lie there and can&#039;t get to sleep.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for something to vibe you up, give you energy, and enhance the colour of your day, I think Modafinil might be a little disappointing.&nbsp; However, I do realise that apparently there is quite a lot of difference between brands so it might be worth trying a few or doing some research if you absolutely must have Modafinil.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in something along the lines of what you&#039;re after though, and I think Adderall might be something to try next (if it wasn&#039;t so damn expensive).

I don&#039;t use it often. Only really when I have a lot of stuff that needs to get done. Very beneficial. <br />I don&#039;t know how it would work for physical work since it&#039;s more for mental clarification but that&#039;s all I really use it for anyway. I find it works well with other Nootropics like Noopept.

				I took modafinil for awhile, it is pretty good for clear alertness. However, taking the same dosage definitely had less and less effect even though I was an infrequent user, i.e. once every couple weeks.<br /><br />I stopped taking it because it gave me a really annoying itchiness in random spots on my body for a day or two afterwards. It makes your body release histamines, and I think the mechanism of action is histamine release to the hypothalamus or something, but histamine release elsewhere in your body causes it to itch. Has anyone else experienced this?

				I&#039;m interested to try it, times ago I saw a tv show where a guy take modafinil and nearly never sleep for days with no problems at all.<br />But with my actual information, I don&#039;t think is safe and I will not go for this king of use.

				I&#039;m quite interested in trying Modafinil, as I hear it wont come up on drug tests either, and wont make false positives either... (When using tests looking for illegal drugs). If I were to buy 10 pills, can 1 pill be used at each time or will I have to increase the dosage the more frequent I use it?? (Not taking it everyday but once every 2 days or so), does tolerance build up fast?<br /><br />I really want to try it but I&#039;m out of btc and have ordered a week ago, Do you feel confident on it? does it help in social situations as well?

				I&#039;ve been interested in this one for a while now. I would like an alternative to amphetamines and I&#039;ve heard really good things about Modafinil. However, I&#039;ve also heard negative/bunk reports from a lot of the stuff on SR so I&#039;ll wait until I have a reliable, U.S. domestic vendor before I try it. Any recommendations?
