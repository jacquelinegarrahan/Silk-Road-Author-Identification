				I tried 2C-B for the first time last week and found it very gentle, it was like medium MDMA with some pretty visuals. I was still in control and felt very relaxed with few body effects at all.

				Have never tried any of the 2C-alkyls (e.g. 2C-E, 2C-P), so can&#039;t comment.&nbsp; My impression is they may not be as easy going as the halos, but not sure about that.

				I posted a thread asking pretty much the same question about a month ago, here was a very helpful response.<br /><br />When people talk about the 2C family, they are referring to a class of psychedelics generally called &quot;substituted phenethylamines&quot;. The &quot;2C&quot; comes from the fact that there are &quot;2 carbons&quot; in the &quot;backbone&quot; of the phenethylamine molecule. If you go to Google and look up an image for phenethylamine, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m referring to.<br /><br />Since they all have this similar nomenclature (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-C, etc) it&#039;s a pretty fair assumption most beginners make to assume that they are all very &quot;similar&quot; to one another. In actuality, they can be dramatically different in both effects and potency.<br /><br />As a class of compounds, they can have some negative side effects you may not like - nausea, cramping, headaches, variable duration of come-up, etc. The dosage required for effects is also variable from person to person. Even though you sound like you have a strong opiod tolerance, I wouldn&#039;t expect that to carry over to these compounds. As for the M1 (methylone), that compound has a very different pharmacological mechanism and I wouldn&#039;t expect tolerance to it to carry over either.<br /><br />The 2C family can be pretty seriously psychedelic and if you are just looking for a good time or a fun buzz, it might not be the best choice, but there are certainly a few that may be worth your time. I will give you my recommendations when I get to the descriptions of each in a moment.<br /><br />There are three types of 2C you will find around here and I will break them down according to *my own personal experiences* with them. Your mind may vary and I would advise reading on Erowid &amp; Bluelight extensively before investing in them. I would also recommend that you absolutely do not bother with any of the 2C drugs unless you have a nice milligram scale. Some people manage to get away with eyeballing, but I would never advise it. Even a 5mg difference can totally change the effects.<br /><br />When I discuss these chems, I&#039;m going based on my experiences at &quot;average&quot; doses per Erowid, etc. If you take a very high dose of *any* of them including 2C-C (despite what many will say), you can wind up in a full-blown, reality-destroying, rolling in your own vomit type of mindfuck. At the same time, taking a barely threshold dose can result in nice anti-depressant stimulation, or just a stomach-ache. You&#039;ll have to figure out your own personal dose-response curve on your own, but always start low!<br /><br />One last precaution - I really recommend having a benzodiazepine (Etizolam, Xanax, Valium) and an anti-psychotic (Haldol, Risperidone) around when you try these. I have saved my ass many a time with the anti-psychotics and sometimes you will come down from the trip but be entirely unable to sleep without the benzodiazepine. The benzos are also helpful when someone is having a &quot;rough&quot; trip. Save the antipsychotics for when you are in serious trouble.<br /><br />ALL DOSES GIVEN ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES. DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY AND ALSO QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT, IT MAY VARY. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO START LOW. START LOW. START LOW. INCREASE SLOWLY! IF NOTHING ELSE, REMEMBER THAT PLEASE!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Halogenated 2C-x<br />In my experience, these are generally gentler and more &quot;fun&quot; than the alkylated or thiolated 2Cs we will discuss next. These are the closest to psychedelic candy that you will find in this family. The &quot;halogen&quot; refers to the bromine, chlorine, or iodine atom that is placed on the phenethylamine ring.<br /><br />2C-C - least potent by dose, mellow, minimal mind-fuck, &quot;sparkly&quot; visuals.&nbsp; (Dose: ~30-45mg)<br />2C-B - best body high for me, interesting mind-space, can be very euphoric and recreational at 15-20mg, a true-blue psych at higher doses. (Dose: ~15-30mg)<br />2C-I - longest duration of halogens, crazy &quot;beams&quot; of light I do not get on any other 2C, very stimulating, headspace clear until higher doses. (Dose: ~7-20mg)<br /><br />All three of these combine well with many other drugs. I have found 2C-C and 2C-B to go very well with mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, LSD, MDMA, and weed. 2C-I is very popular but I suspect that has more to do with availability than anything else. I prefer 2C-B over 2C-I because the duration is shorter, the body-high is better (for me), and the headspace is more &quot;fun&quot;. Also, as the man who invented 2C-B said: &quot;Wherever you are with 2C-B, just hold on tight, in another hour you will be back to somewhere recognizable&quot; (paraphrased). 2C-C is a great compound - it has a fantastic headspace and very interesting visuals, but I feel somewhat mellow / relaxed and also do not get the interesting tactile sensations on it that I do from 2C-B.<br /><br />My recommendation for halogenated 2C-x: 2C-B. Whether it is the HCl or HBr salt, it is a great product. Look for anyone trusted on SR selling it and make sure it is whitish - you don&#039;t want anything brown or yellow - that means it wasn&#039;t washed very well.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Alkylated 2C-x<br /><br />These are 2C-x chemicals where instead of a halogen (bromine, chlorine, iodine) you have a carbon or carbon chain attached to the phenethylamine ring. With the exception of 2C-D, I find these to be much more &quot;serious&quot; than the halogenated phenethylamines. There are really only three that you are going to see around here.<br /><br />2C-D: Least potent, most forgiving, made me feel somewhat drunk or stoned, visuals were nothing unique until higher doses. (Dose: 35-75mg)<br />2C-E: Most popular, can be rough on body, serious visuals. Can be wildly euphoric and manic or very dark. A true psychedelic in every way. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br />2C-P: Absolutely brutal for me. Jittery and hard on my body, mind absolutely destroyed, duration &quot;infinite&quot;. (Dose: 3-12mg)<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend 2C-P to anyone. True psychonauts will seek it out on their own, but it&#039;s not my thing and I think it is too long and too rough for most people. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it unless you build your way up to it with other psychs first. 2C-D is very rare and some people really love it. I was not too impressed by it but it was forgiving and pleasant enough that I will definitely continue to return to it. 2C-E is bar none the &quot;winner&quot; when it comes to these three but I can only recommend it with the caveat that you absolutely start low with the dose.<br /><br />My recommendation for alkylated 2C-x: 2C-E. For some people, this is very recreational. All I will say is that in my experience, it has not been. I also feel no desire to go back to it, but I&#039;m glad I have tried it. I would recommend that you try it at home first and see how you react. It can be very beautiful visually but the body load was too much for me. You will be hard pressed to find a 2C-x that is more legendary or popular though.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thiolated 2C-x<br /><br />These all have a sulfur atom attached to the phenethylamine ring. There are lots of reports out there that indicate wildly varying dose-response curves and durations amongst individuals and I have found this to be very true in my own experience. The same dose of 2C-T-2 that barely affected me put my old girlfriend into outerspace for 8 hours. The duration tends to be longer and the mental effects more serious than the halogenated 2C compounds, but the visuals are wild for me. Again, you&#039;ll probably only see three of these.<br /><br />2C-T-2: My personal favorite but only due to circumstances that occurred while using it. Some GI distress but wild beams of light and fractal patterning, &quot;neutral&quot; and analytical headspace, somewhat dissociating for me. (Dose: 7-25mg)<br />2C-T-4: Only one I have not tried. Read some trip reports - duration is very long. Rare, does not seem to have enjoyable effects profile for most.<br />2C-T-7: Legendary, feels to me like a longer lasting, more visual, more euphoric 2C-T-2. I was far less lucid or coherent but had a much more enjoyable body buzz. Some trembling, tension, and cramping. Lasted much longer than DOC for me. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br /><br />If you find yourself enjoying 2C-E, these will probably be right up your alley. My experiences with T-2 and T-7 are similar to mine with 2C-E in that I&#039;m glad I had them, I can see the appeal and I enjoyed the ride, but I don&#039;t feel particularly compelled to return to them.<br /><br />My recommendation for thiolated 2C-x: 2C-T-2. The thiolated 2C-x compounds are a bit notorious due to the deaths from T-7 and T-21. This is generally regarded to be due to MAO-I (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) activity, so they shouldn&#039;t be combined with medication or other drugs although some still do so.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now, this is a totally shitty guide I have written for you here. Many will have DRAMATICALLY different opinions of these chems and doses. I hope that this at least gives you a ballpark idea of where to start. I personally recommend that you begin with 2C-B. Get a small amount, try a 15mg dose. See where it takes you. Wait a week and try a 20mg dose. Titrate up in a similar manner until you find what you&#039;re looking for. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, by all means explore the rest of the family, but just keep in mind the experience is different every time, every chem.<br /><br />I would recommend personally that you find a good LSD vendor (read reviews and make sure they aren&#039;t selling 25I-NBOMe or DOx on blotter) or a good source for 4-AcO-DMT / mushrooms and try those as well.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t look to anything I&#039;ve said as being textbook or authoritative - read up at Bluelight and Erowid.<br /><br />In any case, I hope you find what you are looking for.

				While I LOVE 25c, I think&nbsp; you&#039;ll have more fun with 25i at a festival ... it gives you more energy, lasts longer, and the mood lift is pretty awesome. <br /><br />By the way, I always use tabs. Nasal sprays are supposed to be a lot more potent which makes it easier to OD ... this isn&#039;t so much a concern with 25i but you&#039;ll get a serious body load if you OD on 25c. <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to try 25d ... just a few more days!<br /><br />

				I agree with Lilly... the nasal spray requires a certain amount of care and responsibility.&nbsp; So in that sense, maybe it&#039;s not a good thing to have around if you&#039;re going to be too fucked up.&nbsp; Honestly, any of these compounds could really fuck you up if you&#039;re not careful.&nbsp; They are not to be used willy nilly.

				25i is lovely noms.<br /><br />My first dose was .5mg tab sucked on for an houre + another .5 tab sucked on for 20 minutes until the first hit me, then I spit the second out. super clean come up, peak, and come down.<br /><br />One word of advice is that you might want to b someplace safe when it hits you. One friend said it hit really hard and freaked him out for twenty minutes, but then again, time stopped, so it could have been two minutes.<br /><br />Another guy banged some mda before taking it (I had no idea) and were tripping on mxe, he had a very bad experience.<br /><br />The first guy had a great time, the second, I had no idea he was not a psychonaut. ( i researched the fuck out of the drugs, not the people I tripped with, oops)<br /><br />Walking around on a busy street&nbsp; at night was lovely.&nbsp; Purely content. The air was wonderful, the lights were pretty, everything was perfect. <br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with &quot;bumping&quot; with extra tabs? Specifically with 25c? Any idea on max dosage?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I do know one thing about the max dosage, none will take more than one of my tabs... unless they are really cute and give bambi eyes...&nbsp; I&#039;m a sucker for bambi eyes.<br /><br />Love and respect your noms,<br />T.S.

				2c-i is my personal favorite, it&#039;s so easy to control that you make your own trip possible.<br />2c-b is my second favorite because it has more OEV than 2c-i and is more close to LSD (in terms of visuals).<br />2c-e is a blend (in my opinion) of 2c-i and 2c-b so you gotta love that, I rarely do it now but it&#039;s part of my top three. <br /><br />I just ordered some 2c-d because of its &quot;smart&quot; properties so we&#039;ll see how it goes&nbsp; ;)

				don&#039;t snort 20mg of 2c-e unless you are in a safe place. LOL.<br /><br />It&#039;s hella fun at that dose, but not fun in a sketchy environment, like for instance in a van with blacked out windows with cops knocking to ask why you are parked illegally at a park at night. o flashlight, no cell phone to call for a rescue, no music, no light, just somebody to cuddle with, but not have sex with.<br /><br />Do not do that.&nbsp; Ever, unless you are into that sort of shit, then more power to you. :)<br /><br />

				Snorting the 2C&#039;s are not the best ROA in my opinion.<br /><br />I always intake 2C by mouth and swallow chute but i was with someone that snort 2c-E he was completly insane! For 48h, he can&#039;t see anything, big blackout sometimes, feeling great then bad then great then bad each minutes for 48h! That was a nightmare to watch, almost call the medical safety.<br /><br />2C-E particularly can be very strong if you go for more than 20mg, and it increase very very fast i mean double this dose and you will feel completly sick!!<br />i&#039;m ok with 2C-I way more controllable and easy.<br /><br />But my prefered is 2c-B, very amazing this one, it changes all your senses on a funny/interesting side with very low overwhelming.<br />Touch is amazing, you are one with what you are in contact with.<br />Smell and taste is just incredible, you feel the taste very profound.<br />Visuals are fun, like mescaline, red/green afterglow and lsd-like with some colors visuals<br />And listen to the music, you feel each sound of the music having different place into the space of the room. Just great as hell !<br />2C-B gives a good amount of energy too, like lsd.<br /><br />But be very careful with dosage on 2C it can go to pure fun with the good dosage to very bad moments if you take too much.

				So I just read through this thread and didn&#039;t see a whole lot about 2C-C? Is that midler than 2C-B?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for one that will be somewhat mild and not very long lasting. I read that 2c-c was mild but I didn&#039;t hear much personal experience with it.

				2c-c is the most mild trip you can achieve among the 2c&#039;s, very little to no body load. It&#039;s also the least potent so don&#039;t dose below 20mg. It&#039;s a calm and mellow kind of trip, music is really nice on it, visuals are apparent around the 30-50mg range. It&#039;s a wading pool for beginners. <br /><br />If you&#039;re into mxe at all, drink about 20-30mg of each for a magical time.&nbsp; :)

				Cool sounds good. I&#039;ve done shrooms and LSD which I got from SR. Lol I took a tab at night and listened to music all night but didnt get ANY sleep. The next day at work I was still tripping hard (but I was able to keep my shit together) but it was the longest freaking day of my life. Yeah I know I really did it the wrong way but I didn&#039;t have a &quot;bad&quot; trip just an exhausting one.<br /><br />So that is why I was looking at 2c-c as a nice way to get back into psychedelics without being too crazy
