				Hi guys!<br />I did MDMA, LSD, and some RCs in the past.<br />Most of the experiences were fun, but thing is: the day after i took these drugs (specially mdma) i feel drained and super-tired, and also a bit depressed (exclusively with MDMA and only when i dont take vit c before and after).<br /><br />So well, basically my question is: is there any drug that is fun to take and doesnt leave you fucked up the other day?<br /><br />Thanks.

				personally, i never feel bad the day after a trip or a roll... if you feel depressed after mdma use, chances are you&#039;re either doing it too often or you have a serotonin deficiency. supplementing with 5-htp should help if it&#039;s the latter. as far as your question goes, i&#039;d recommend ketamine for that. just be careful and use it in moderation because it can be psychologically addictive.

The reason you feel drained the following day is probably because you don&#039;t eat enough when tripping (LSD changes your appetite, plus eating can upset the stomach), you aren&#039;t staying properly hydrated, you are staying up to late, and/or you expend more energy when tripping than you normally do. LSD is not harmful to the brain.<br /><br />My suggestion is to get in shape so that LSD doesn&#039;t make you feel drained. When I was out of shape, LSD made me feel drained too....<br /><br />As for other drugs....&nbsp; cannabis and mushrooms.

				I&#039;&#039;m a fairly big guy, but 100mg of mdma is enough for me, some tabs have 220mg, I use only crystal and its on SR that I found the real thing! Crystal atright from the lab, no cuts!<br /><br />To prepare for MDMA take some planning. Location is important, the local pub is no good as your eyes have SRUDS written allover them. MDMA is not a drug you can hide socially.<br /><br />I eat well before any night out - every drug takes something out of you, for me MDMA kinda gets the come down 24 hr later. Next day I feel fine - always sleep well and need not help also. no sleepimg aids.Taking vits and so is not a good substatute for good food and good sleep.<br /><br />I find pure MDMA is kinder than alcohol for example.<br /><br />I often go out with a 59mg tops, top up! Never had ti take a I was already high as a kite.<br /><br />Also, eating a sandwich qhwn you get it in is a good idea.<br /><br />I do use vit C as its easily depleted.<br /><br />Using E with alcohol lessons the effects as your us ing a stimulant and depresent.<br /><br />Red<br /><br />ps I use E maybe 4 times a year, I think that 3 months later your tolerance is not an issue<br /><br />Use every weekend and yyou WILL end up depressed and worn out. Use Friday and Saturday and expect to feel bad. MDMA is not a drug to be used like hash. More like LSD, a few times a year.<br /><br />E is a VERY powerful drug, not as forgiving as alcohol and no way as forgiving as good bud or hash.<br /><br />Also NEVER buy E off a stranger in a pub/club. I NEVER use tabs as few dealers can quote me the total mdma content, I think 220 mg is too strong a dose and you would feel buenrt out. 7 hours dancing does that normally.<br /><br />Good luck and read up on drugs before.<br /><br />Red.<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, sometimes I feel horrible the day after I take LSD.<br /><br />Like my head will just be pounding horribly, and I&#039;ll feel like I have the flu(even though I don&#039;t).<br /><br />Well actually that only happened on one occasion. But I&#039;d take it a million times again because of the fun nature of the trip.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want after effects, don&#039;t take the drug.

				You&#039;re going to be hard pressed to find a drug that makes you feel good without having a comedown of some sort (just kind of the name of the game when rebalancing whatever part of your body/brain you fucked with). That said, proper supplementing and nutrition intake, both before, during, and after can greatly reduce, and sometimes eliminate, detrimental effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />Others have mentioned 5-HTP for MDMA but for pretty much any stimulant I have a regimen of supplements I take beforehand--Vitamin C, generic multivitamin, chelated magnesium, sometimes another antioxidant supplement and sometimes racetam(s) [although I&#039;m not sure what protective qualities they have, if any, or if they&#039;re commonly accepted for this purpose yet].<br /><br />&nbsp;I also drink a lot of juices rich in nutrients throughout since I know I will only be able to force sparce amounts of food into me. Also, try eating fruit if you have an opportunity during your use. I find fruits to be fairly easy to eat and provide additional hydration and nutrients and will help settle your stomach if it&#039;s been empty for a long time. <br /><br />Hope some of this helps. <br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				So as far as MDMA goes I feel MUCH better the next day if I end the trip with a little 2CB. It seems completely counter intuitive that a mild hallucinogen would make things better the next day but there it is. 10-15mg near the end of a roll and it keeps me going a little longer before trailing off to sleep.

				Multiple usage of MDMA can cause damage to the dopamine reuptake centers.&nbsp; Your brain floods with serotonin, so much so, that the serotonin finds its way into the dopamine reuptake centers and when it goes through, the chemical breakdown is similar to bleach in your brain - fries it out.&nbsp; Best thing to do (most doctors agree that permanent / long-term damage can be nullified) if you take some sort of anti-depressant 6-8 hours after your last dosage of MDMA.&nbsp; It may not help for the post-roll physical feelings, but it will definitely help your roll in the future sessions and reduce the chances of permanent brain damage.

Someone gives a few rats some Prozac after an MDMA session, notices some altered brain chemistry, and then it becomes gospel&nbsp; that SSRI cures MDMA related neuro-toxicity.<br /><br />Honestly, after years of human study on my own brain I find the best cure for doing a bunch of MDMA is to just spend the next day in bed mostly sleeping. As long as I don&#039;t have big plans for the next day the extra sleep normally leaves me feeling dandy Oddly enough, if I take a small dose of 2CB at the end of a roll I end up feeling pretty dandy the next day too.<br /><br />SSRI&#039;s I&#039;ve tried because I too was stupid and young once and they never really did much for me. I think my hangovers from E have a lot more to do with staying up all night than with any real brain damage, but that could just me.

You can&#039;t say what &#039;works&#039; based on how it makes you feel.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Totally agree. But feeling better is normally my goal, I totally accept the fact that every drug I take, caffeine, nicotine , alcohol, sugar, processed foods, anti-biotics, exercise, and the like all have long term lasting health effects on my body and my mind. I can&#039;t see the changes they make but I can feel them and my point is that after a good nights sleeps on MDMA I feel the damage less than if I get three hours of sleep and then try to run out and have a normal day. In my mind, as a person who thinks the goal of most drug related science is to demonize all drugs that aren&#039;t patented, this whole notion of MDMA being bad for you at effective doses is just criminal since these same scientists are helping drug companies patent new SSRI&#039;s that help people going on killing rampages in movie theaters while MDMA at it&#039;s worst makes me give back rubs to strangers. <br /><br />So yes, MDMA is neurotoxic, my brain is damaged as a result of the drugs I take. My brain is also damaged by the 1/4 with cheese I ate this afternoon as well as by the exhaust of that truck that just drove by my open window. No one studies how damaging those things are to my brain because they are all legal and people make money shoving those poisons into my head while large corporations are mostly left out of the profit of recreational drug use.<br /><br />For me, I feel worse if I take too much MDMA too often and so I take smaller doses and spread them out. I go on my feelings because the science is so far beyond flawed that I would rather trust what I know and feel than what someone who is being paid to lie to me tells me he thinks is happening.

Someone gives a few rats some Prozac after an MDMA session, notices some altered brain chemistry, and then it becomes gospel&nbsp; that SSRI cures MDMA related neuro-toxicity.<br /><br />Honestly, after years of human study on my own brain I find the best cure for doing a bunch of MDMA is to just spend the next day in bed mostly sleeping. As long as I don&#039;t have big plans for the next day the extra sleep normally leaves me feeling dandy Oddly enough, if I take a small dose of 2CB at the end of a roll I end up feeling pretty dandy the next day too.<br /><br />SSRI&#039;s I&#039;ve tried because I too was stupid and young once and they never really did much for me. I think my hangovers from E have a lot more to do with staying up all night than with any real brain damage, but that could just me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My personal theory about the SSRI issue is that the rats were massively dosed with MDMA (as they usually are in studies), having no serotonin left to cause serotonin syndrome with. The SSRIs would then protect the vacant serotonin system from dopamine which can be converted into hydrogen peroxide.<br />I once tried SSRIs after MDMA and the result was kind of unpleasant.<br /><br />In response to the original question, mushrooms/4-Aco-DMT tend to leave me with an amazing afterglow. A one-time use of benzos can be enjoyable and doesnt usually produce a hangover but they can be ruthlessly habit forming. Also while not extremely recreational, tramadol doesnt seem to give me a hangover.<br />If MDMA doesnt work out for you maybe give Methylone a shot as well.<br /><br />
