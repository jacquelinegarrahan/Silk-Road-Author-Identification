				So I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this with 2cb or if it was just a coincidence.<br /><br />I just got another batch from a seller the other day. I did have slight headache during the day so I am thinking its most likely that these symptoms may have been building up. So I ended up taking a 25mg dose in a capsule.<br /><br />Well about 2-3 hours in I started experiencing massive headaches, mucus buildup, coughing and very scratchy throat feeling, where even drinking still hurt my throat. At that I just started drinking as much water as I could and had soup. So I didn&#039;t really experience anything at all on the 2cb besides not being able to go to sleep and some small CEV&#039;s. <br /><br />Just wondering if this is common for 2cb or maybe if I already had this building up from earlier in the day. I&#039;ll try that batch again in 2 weeks I guess and see how it goes.

				That is definitely not common and I would lean towards you coming down with something AND a weak batch. It seems like there was someone on here complaining that a vendors recent batch of 2cb was very weak.

				Hmm I wonder if it&#039;s the same vendor...would you be able to PM me the vendors name or the post link? At 25mg I usually have insane visuals, this one was barely any visuals or sound enlightment..

				You have a headache and you take 2C-B? That is REALLY stupid sorry.<br />It&#039;s like putting on a jacket in the sauna just to make it worse. 2C-B will amplify the symptoms of the headache massively as it will do with any other body discomfort/pain.<br /><br />Now what I can report is skin irritations just like when you shave very sensitive parts to harshly. I had these the day after, it looked a little bit like an allergic reaction but with the crazy amounts of 2C-B I consumed the night before I don&#039;t think it was one as it would be much more distinct.

				Yeah I know it was incredibly stupid...sometimes boredom get&#039;s people to do dumb things. <br />I know now to never do it again when I am feeling sick and now I can let other&#039;s know the same.<br /><br />Well I have been running into my friends that got sick as well, and all the allergies kicking up so I&#039;m hoping it was all that...I&#039;ll be trying again tommorow now that I am better and hopefully it will all work out fine.

				Hi,<br />It seems that some people are experiencing cough with 2c-b, there is a short story about this on Erowid :https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_info1.shtml. So this may be a kind of allergic reaction to the product.<br /><br />WL
