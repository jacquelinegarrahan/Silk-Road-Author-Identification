				I am wanting to try using mdma for therapy for my wife and myself. There are a couple of things that I am concerned about. One is I have heard that you start telling everything kind of like a truth serum. We have been married 34 yrs and there are things that dont need to be brought up I plan on keeping it that way. I am a firm believer in what you or her dont know doesnt hurt you. This is one reason I am hesitate about trying mdma. But my wife needs to be freed from her past and also sexually she cant seem to ( let go ) If we do this how much should we take? I watched a documentary and they said the therapist used 50 mgs with a lot of success. <br />I am 54 she is 50 <br />Thanks for any advice

It&#039;s not a &quot;truth serum&quot; per-se, but it does lower you inhibitions and by releasing the neurotransmitter serotonin in your brain, and you get a really warm/fuzzy and highly empathetic feeling. A feeling of peace with the world. I&#039;ve never in my life heard of somebody disliking the drug, unless they overdid it. 50mg is quite a small dose, but then again I am 20 years old and I take ~200-300mg most times when I take the drug and have been using it off and on for a few years. It can bring you and your loved one closer together though a meaningful experience and by making it easier to talk about things and easier to relate to what you are hearing. I would say 50-80mg would be a good dose, and I am 100% convinced that MDMA and other drugs such as LSD have much therapeutic potential.

				I would advise doing it at home. Keep some music you both enjoy close by. And some soft blankets. It really heightens your sense of touch. If not at home maybe a warm beach at night, assuming you live in a tropical place or the southern hemisphere haha. Just some place comfy.

				I think those above covered most of what I would have said--it sounds like you are going to dose low which is a solid move. And doing it, especially for therapeutic purposes and opening sensitive dialogue a private, relaxing, and safe setting would likely be best. The only thing I think I&#039;d add to the above advice is that you mentioned your concern about &quot;truth-serum&quot; qualities. I believe that most drugs will bend to the will of the user--to some extent. MDMA won&#039;t make you do anything unless it&#039;s something you want to do: then MDMA may help give you that push to go for it. <br /><br />I know some secrets are best left buried and it sounds like your reason to not bring these up are not for deception purposes but because you care about her. MDMA will only make you more convinced that you are making the right choice--you may feel as if you love her more than ever: so much it could damn near bring you to tears. It might actually hurt because you become so aware of your feelings and hers and how much you care and how important she is to you. It&#039;s a beautiful level of connection to achieve and that&#039;s a big appeal for MDMA, recreationally and therapeutically. <br /><br />I wish you both luck and would like to hear how things work out. Just don&#039;t expect a magic cure-all in one session, especially at a low dose as that--although one session will likely have some significant effects and may facilitate enough of a catharsis that it really is, in some sense, a cure-all. <br /><br />Be safe, relax, and let things flow naturally. Also, I&#039;d encourage having some vitamins beforehand and a pitcher of water nearby to keep yourselves hydrated. <br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Snoopish (+1) was earlier in the advice I would have posted.<br />I may add that music is very important. Turn it up &gt; feel stronger, turn it down &gt; end any stressful moments.<br />The first few times I vomited but it felt like a pleasant release that set me up for 6-8 hrs of warm empathy. <br />Dosewise I&#039;d recommend 1.5mg/kg for a euphoric time. Keep it moderate on yr 1st time to have an even better 2nd in the future. <br />To many people the comeup is felt better when dancing as it (there&#039;s a reason for allnight raving.) <br />Keep some fruits ready for the comedown. And yes, keep us informed. :D

				Thanks I will let yall know how it turns out ( but it will be a few weeks because of work)<br />Know whats funny in 1983 or 84&nbsp; I worked for a man named Mark Creech He was a swimming pool builder,dhe came to me telling me about this new drug that was awesome and was legal because the cops didnt know about it. Asked me if I wanted to help him sell it, I turned him&nbsp; down because I had a 5 yr old kid. He said he was going to make make a $1,000,000&nbsp; then quit. Last I heard in 1985 he was the first one busted for mdma in the us he had made 2,000,000 divorced his wife and was partying in a hotel in Dallas with a couple Playboy bunnies when they got him . He had been selling to the Feds for 3 or 4 months.<br />Small world HUH
