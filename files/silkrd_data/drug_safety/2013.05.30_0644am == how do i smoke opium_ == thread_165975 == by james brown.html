				whats the best practice? I tried hot spotting it but didn&#039;t get much smoke at all and the O just turned all stringy. tried it in a crack pipe and it sort of worked.... I read somewhere online that a lightbulb vape can work well, is this true? how hot etc do i need to get it? Don&#039;t say get an opium pipe because from what i gather u need a large amount to get those things working right. I only have a gram to test out. cheers in advance :)

				Grab a steel butter knife, place a small bit on the end. <br /><br />Turn on the stove, grab another steel butter knife and place it over the fire.&nbsp; <br /><br />Leave it there till the end gets very hot.<br /><br />Once ready get ready to inhale and place the very hot end gently on the opium on the other knife and inhale the smoke.<br /><br />Repeat.

This is my hitherto preferred method. If you master it, there is minimal waste and its a good way to accomadate multiple smokers, as you merely need more knives. However, I recommend you dedicate a pair of knives to this if you plan on more than trying it once, as the knife can become blackened by repeat use. Make sure you start inhaling before you touch it with the hot knife and to touch it as lightly as possible.

				As an adds-on to the previous:<br /><br />To inhale use a cone (made of paper, for example) with the smaller end in your mouth and the larger to get the smoke in. It works better than a cylindrical funnel for opium.

				A metal tube fitted with a mouth piece is also effective, in that you can place the tube almost on the opium and capture all the smoke with the suction you create.<br /><br />So many options!

				Something like a crack pipe is actually the original implement to smoke opium - it has been for centuries. In opium dens around the world a pipe is used that is heated over, traditionally, an oil lamp. This pipe holds the opium and has a small hole in it on the &#039;hot&#039; side so you can breathe in air and vapours through it, just like a modern meth pipe typically used with a lighter as the heat source. <br /><br />This is not the only way though, i&#039;ve seen people roll in opium wiht tobacco into &#039;joints&#039; and use it that way, but that seems to be something popular in the far east where raw opium is abundant and cheap.

				Best way is to vape it. Using a hot knife might burn off some of the active chemicals.<br /><br />A glass pipe which could be gemtly heated would be another option.<br /><br />I&#039;d hate to go in a head shop and get a crack pipe, but yes, that would work fine really.<br /><br />Had a no show on some opium so can only wonder what its like.<br /><br />

				As i live in the netherlands owning drug paraphernalia like crack pipes is not a problem at all, i would recommend using one to smoke opium.I know people make all kinds of tinfoil contraptions in other countries, or resort to using heated pieces of metal to vaporize the drug. <br /><br />I suppose it can be required to do so in some countries, but that doesn&#039;t mean the solution at hand is superior to a glass pipe with a hole in it ;)
