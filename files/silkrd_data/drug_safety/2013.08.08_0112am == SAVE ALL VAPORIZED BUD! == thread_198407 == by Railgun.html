				I see a lot of people disregard their vaped bud because it&#039;s no longer seen as viable.&nbsp; It is viable.<br /><br />Unless you are vaporizing at near combustion temperatures (421 F or so), only over 60% of the THC and other goodies are being vaped.:<br /><br />*Clearnet <br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporizer_%28cannabis%29<br />*Clearnet <br /><br />This makes sense too. When you smoke a bowl, you pretty much scorch it until it&#039;s ashed or kicked-so it&#039;s only logical that there&#039;s a lot more left when the bud hasn&#039;t burned.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read and experienced, I&#039;d say vaped bud is about 30% of the original potency, largely because the THC (which vapes at ~340F) is the first to vape off.&nbsp; It results in a pretty indica/hash-like buzz, irrespective of the original strain because the CBD is in higher proportions. <br /><br /><br />A good method is to just take a bunch of vaped:<br />-Use 99% isopropyl alcohol and douse it just enough to get it wet.<br />-Squeeze the droplets from this bud/alcohol mixture onto some fresh pot. <br />-Let the fresh pot dry.<br />-Vape the fresh pot.<br /><br />Thus, you have made your new bud about 30% more potent. The bowls last longer each time. The more vaped bud you use, the more it&#039;s going to result in couchlock.&nbsp; Strangely, when I add it to Sativas, it gets more trippy but in a calm way.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy you fucking potheads.

				Vaped bud is still strong enough to use for cooking. It makes nice MJ butter and MJ tea, though obviously not a strong as using fresh herb.

It can be used for edibles as well as the alcohol will boil off quickly, especially 99%.<br /><br />Also, the resin that&#039;s stuck to vaporizer parts is even more potent, so a good alcohol wash--which is already needed to keep a vape clean--can always result in more meds.

				I&#039;ve got a little jar going.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing how good it still smells as opposed to the charred remains of smoking.&nbsp; Usually start out vaping then end up taking a few bubbler hits to make sleepytime come<br />Anyone else have a launch box?&nbsp; I love that simple little wooden thing.&nbsp; Art, science, vaping device.
