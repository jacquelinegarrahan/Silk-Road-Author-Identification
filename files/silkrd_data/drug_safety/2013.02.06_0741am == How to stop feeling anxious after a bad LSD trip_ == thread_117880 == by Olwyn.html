				Previous to these two trips, I had tried LSD twice, both with weak doses around 75ug. I didn&#039;t experience much of anything, just happy and a little energetic with objects slightly breathing. For my first real LSD trip, I planned on taking 200ug and watching a bunch of movies/listening to music all night. I put the blotter in my mouth, and took a long hot shower while waiting for the come up. Once it hit, I felt giddy and energetic, and my vision seemed sharper - I went to my room, and popped in the first movie I had planned for my trip, a movie about a dog called Big Red. The experience was very enjoyable - the colors were amazing, I was laughing, having a good time, etc.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, I decided I was having such a good time that I wanted to experience more, so I took a second tab for a total of 400ug and started a second movie. The experience was awesome - at first, I didn&#039;t notice how hard I was tripping, but soon I started noticing the room was seeming to be much larger than it actually was, etc. Very strange feelings. <br /><br />At one point, the movie I was watching started to get a little dark/scary - At first, I didn&#039;t realize that this was effecting me. I started associating the antagonist of the film with Satan, and I vaguely remember having an inner dialogue with him. At this point, I heard my roomie get up to use the restroom, and this broke me out of my inner dialogue, and I realized I felt very panicked and claustrophobic. I immediately turned off the movie, realizing that it&#039;s dark tones had effected my mood, and instead put on My Little Pony xD At first, it was difficult to find an episode that I felt comfortable watching, because even small things would upset me, for instance a bird constantly getting sick and losing it&#039;s feathers or turning into a skeleton. After some tense moments, I found an episode that seemed to be completely light hearted that I could focus on. I went downstairs, brought my dog up with me, and sat in bed for the rest of the night watching My Little Pony while holding my dog. For the most part, I was able to calm down, although I can remember feeling anxious/nervous in waves. It would come and go. The next day I felt drained and slightly shakey, but otherwise fine.<br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve realized how important it is to have only positive things around you during a trip. Even while tripping, I wasn&#039;t afraid of the movie itself - it simply took my mind to a darker place and caused me to feel paranoid and scared. Throughout the entire experience, even though I was scared, I knew I was fine, and knew as long as I surrounded myself with positive things like my dog and simple cartoons, I would calm down. It was strange, because even at the time I understood I had nothing to be afraid of, and it felt surreal to know I had nothing to fear yet was still fearful.<br /><br />Two weeks later, for my second trip, I made 100% sure that everything I had planned was positive - I picked out very energetic/happy music and movies with simple stories that I knew I would be able to follow and enjoy. I also made sure that I would only take 200ug this time. I sat at my computer listening to positive music while waiting for the come up. Before any visuals or anything had even started, I was suddenly hit with a wave of anxiety, which I didn&#039;t experience the first time. I had a very strong urge to not be alone, so I woke up my sleeping roomie and explained to him that I needed someone to watch TV with. At first, even being with someone else didn&#039;t calm me, and I remember feeling very confused about why I was anxious - I had no visuals, saw nothing scary, and had no discernable reason to feel the way I did. I just felt anxious. After about 10-15 minutes, I started to calm, and after about an hour I felt completely euphoric and comfortable to be on my own. For the rest of the night, I laid in my bed alone listening to music and had a blast - It sounded amazing, and I could close my eyes and it felt as if my body didn&#039;t exist anymore, and it was as if I were floating through the music. The next day, it felt the complete opposite of the first trip - I wasn&#039;t shaky, and instead of feeling drained, everything was bright and vivid, and I had a blast going around the city doing things.<br /><br /><br />TL;DR - I had a semi-bad trip the first time around, and I think it&#039;s causing me to be anxious/panicky during the come up on my other trips. Despite this feeling, I love tripping once I&#039;ve reached the peak, and I want to find a way to get more comfortable with getting there. I&#039;d love to hear what others with similar experiences have to say.

				It is just a negative feedback loop you are getting into and the way to break it for me if it starts to happen is simply to do something positive or creative. Sitting watching tv is anyway IMO a very sub-optimum way to spend your tripping time.<br /><br />Somebody here compiled a list of things one can do while tripping with all kind of cool and fun ideas - try going through the list and find something you think could be interesting. As a back-up plan at least ensure you have some uplifting movies or music ready so you are not just left with whatever the tv decides to show.

				In the past when I was introduced to Lucy I was told &quot;You have to die once before you really know and respect Lucy!&quot;<br /><br />The comeup can be a bit rough sometimes but once you got through this door it should be fine. As a tip dont smoke sativa weed with a low tolerance during the comeup. <br />

				Just embracing the positive is missing out about 50 percent of the range of feelings you can experience. It is okay to be afraid, to hate and to wrath. The moment you can accept that you are capable of feeling those too you will grow as a human being. Probably more than by just feeling &quot;positive&quot; all the time. If you meet the devil the next time, try to talk to him and accept what he tells you, he will lose his power :). As far as my experience go, you meet your Shadow in these types of experiences. &quot;The Shadow&quot; basically is a subconscious swamp of all habits and feelings society frowns upon. Therefore, to be accepted by others, we suppress them and are afraid of them. Facing those can teach you one of the most valuable lessons acid has to teach.<br /><br />If you like the type of music try tool&#039;s forty six and 2, very fitting lyrics there. The song is just plainly awesome anyway ;)<br /><br />I choose to live and to<br />Grow, take and give and to<br />Move, learn and love and to<br />Cry, kill and die and to<br />Be paranoid and to<br />Lie, hate and fear and to<br />Do what it takes to move through.<br /><br /><br />For a lesson on &quot;letting go&quot; and accepting bad things in your life, and maybe yourself search for &quot;Eckhart Tolle&quot; on YouTube.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Without Black there would be no White -- Resistance causes anxiety which makes a trip worse. Dip your foot into that dark pool and allow it to take you - just sit with full awareness of your body and observe. <br /><br />A meditation technique is to imagine internal mental chatter as a figurative &quot;Bubble&quot; - Each thought you have is its own Bubble that contains a small world of cities, roads, nature and experiences. As you sit and meditate, many Bubble thoughts will spiral around until one is in-front of your face (conscious). The technique is to acknowledge the Bubble&#039;s existence and then allow it to move along and be replaced by one which you&#039;d rather dive into. The act of even questioning a Bubble existing IS engaging into its World, so don&#039;t get tricked and have a good time&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Sensory perception is a great way to control a wondering mind. Focus on how your skin feels, feel the energy being sent from your brain that controls your lungs, stomach, eyelids, heart, feel your muscle fibers lengthen and tighten as you move different parts. Become deeply fascinated with small intricacies of this sack of meat that you call a body. Then allow your brain to explode in frustration as you come to conclusions that you&#039;ll never, no matter how desperate you attempt, be able to explain with language and clear thoughts. <br /><br />Then jack off to rape scenes and really feel like a piece of shit 8)

				Olwyn,<br /><br />I used to get trips just like yours, so I can relate. I stopped having bad trips once I changed my DAILY set and setting, not just the set and setting on the day of tripping. <br /><br />Some of these suggestions may not be applicable to you, but they worked for me:<br /><br />- Anxiety causes you to lock down and clench, holding tension in the body. Working in reverse, if you can take away the physical response that anxiety provokes, you can also relieve the anxiety itself. I have prevented several bad trips simply by stretching. In fact, I started stretching spontaneously during a particularly bad trip, without knowing that it would relieve my anxiety. My anxiety quickly dissipated.<br /><br />- As already mentioned, learn to meditate. If you can&#039;t commit yourself to meditating daily, which I have found to be a very beneficial practice as a user of psychedelics, try at least meditating prior to the trip and during the trip.<br /><br />- Eat healthy, exercise daily, get lots of sunlight, etc.<br /><br />- After a series of bad trips, one pattern I noticed was that the cup of coffee I tended to drink mid-trip was increasing my anxiety levels. I wouldn&#039;t have noticed this connection without the heightened awareness of LSD. Since eliminating caffeine from my daily diet, I noticed a huge reduction in my level of anxiety during my trips (and in my life in general)<br /><br />- Do you smoke marijuana? Marijuana seems to increase my paranoia. I usually save it for the come-down if i take any at all<br /><br />- Try taking a break from LSD for a while if you haven&#039;t done so already. the memory of your first trip is probably causing your bad trips<br /><br />- Trip on days that you are already feeling great.<br /><br />- Have sex<br /><br />- Continue doing the things you mentioned. Positive music, keep good things on TV, etc.<br /><br />Good luck.
