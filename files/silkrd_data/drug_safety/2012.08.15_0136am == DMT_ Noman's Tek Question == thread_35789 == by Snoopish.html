				So I&#039;m trying to cook up some DMT and feel I&#039;ve made some progress in my technique. I&#039;ve had some issues but am learning really quick. <br />My big thing is in regards to the post freezing process. I think this is the only part I&#039;m not doing especially well in. Noman talks of washing the DMT after filtering the Naphtha&nbsp; but changes from ammonia to recommending Vovin&#039;s tech of washing the naphtha with water and a base. <br /><br />My question is how to do this? Do they mean get new naphtha, wash it with water and base, then pour the naphtha over the dmt crystals? Or do they mean run the water/sodium carbonate solution in the naphtha with the DMT (that is just coming out of the freezer), filter out the water, then filter out the Naphtha for DMT?<br /><br />Anybody who can gimme some advice on how to make this work would be great!

				The first question I would ask is why do I need to wash in the first place?<br /><br />Unless you have introduced lots of contamination from pulling the DMT from your base you are good to go. Washing will only reduce yield, so unless you have a thing about some really nice pure crystals. Which I get by the way, because it is nice to try and make a clean pure final product, or contamination there is no need to wash.<br /><br />You can remove base contamination by;<br /><br />Dissolving your DMT into the minimum amount of hot naphtha, using a safe method to heat the naphtha up. Try to use a small glass bowl for this so you can see the liquid.&nbsp; Let the solvent cool a little and then you will see any base contamination fall to the bottom of the bowl. Either pour out naphtha into another bowl leaving the residual behind. Or use a syringe with cotton wool in to draw the naphtha out.<br /><br />Leave this to evaporate over a day.<br /><br />Nice large clean crystals will form.<br /><br />The less solvent you use the better, remember that it is the volume and temperature of the solvent that dictates how much DMT you can dissolve in it. But be safe when you heat naphtha up. No open flames please! look at how to melt chocolate in water for ideas.<br /><br />FH

				Thanks for the info. I ended up smoking what I produced to some effect so I may not wash it after all (so as to not really risk fucking it up mostly). I got a little more of my test product to go and I think I&#039;ve got the method down.<br /><br />Cheers<br />
