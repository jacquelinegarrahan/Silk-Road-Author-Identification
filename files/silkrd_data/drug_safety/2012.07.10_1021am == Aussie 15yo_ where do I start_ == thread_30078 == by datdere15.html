				Look guys, he&#039;s not gonna listen to a word we say. He&#039;s already made the choice<br /><br />Therefore I&#039;d say stick to booze and weed. I wouldn&#039;t start on anything harder til you&#039;re 17-18. But if you&#039;re not gonna listen to that, do something like 2c-b or 25i-nbome, that&#039;s relatively benign. Just stay off the coke/MDMA til you&#039;re a bit older, it can fuck up your development

				Start by getting off the site man, your too young to be on here... Although if you already made it this far you&#039;re obviously not going to back down are you.. <br /><br />One main thing though, DON&#039;T ship anything to your house (assuming that you live with your parents), as your parents will be the ones who will get the blame if anything happens seeing as you&#039;re still a kid. Get it shipped to a mates house or something if you must still order anything

				Thanks for the feedback.<br />The media&#039;s portrayal of drugs is somewhat untrue, and I thought it would be best to ask actual drug users (you guys) what they thought about it.<br />So thanks, and I guess that I will lay off anything for a while.

But they lie dormant, always there to pounce when you&#039;re at your weakest.<br />There are many ups and downs while growing up. Some of those downs, you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;ll ever recover from. These are the weak moments.<br />Not that there won&#039;t be weak moments when you&#039;re older. But hopefully by then, reason will prevail over impulse.<br /><br />Stay safe mate.<br />

Consider the optics of the situation -- the only reasons I can think of are a cop, a journalist or some anti-drug crusading type, trying to get ammunition to use against the site and/or its operators. You can see the screaming headlines now: &quot;15 year olds corrupted by online drug pushing site&quot; or something to that effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even if the kid were the genuine article (and he may well be) you can bet that any responses other than telling him to wait until he&#039;s older would be used like a club to beat us over the head with. <br /><br />There is enough bull already in Australia as it is, with Senator Conroy wanting to filter the Internet there, so it&#039;s a safe place for children, and followers of Bronze Age religions like himself. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah true-say actually Guru. If I was 15 again (all those years ago lol) there is no way I would disclose my age on a site like this because I&#039;d be worried about a bunch of wankshafts talking down to me (not calling anyone a wankshaft here, just saying it how a 15 year old would see it, chill out, it&#039;s all good). Anyway yeah, no way I would do it and I can&#039;t imagine any other 15 year old doing it either. They may AT A PUSH say they are under 18 but not outright say &quot;Oh yeah I&#039;m 15&quot;. <br /><br />

				Where do you start?<br /><br />1. By not revealing your age first thing (this compromises your security)<br />2. Search for specific threads under the different sub forums to get a feel for different aspects of this place.<br />3. Make sure you read up on drug safety and make sure you don&#039;t get into anything too addictive<br />4. You admitted your age, and had to ask the question, which might be indication you&#039;re not ready to take the precautions/risks associated with trading on SR.<br />5. If you&#039;re a reporter etc, EFF OFF YO!

Now coke time, don&#039;t wait for the H to kick in smash back to line .1g in each nostril. Now sure this will put you in a very messed state of euphoric vomiting spasms, but why stop? You only get one first time. Google Hotrails now you will need some meth but 1g should do. <br />Don&#039;t try and do the whole gram in one go, split in into two equal potions and again each nostril for best result.<br /><br />Give it about half hour when you are really experiencing that &quot;comotozed feeling&quot; DON&#039;T WORRY this is part of the journey. <br /><br />Now this is important when you feel like you are losing it grab two NOT one acid hits. Slip them under your tongue and let it work its magic. You will start a journey which you will quite possibly enjoy.<br />So there you go my friend enjoy but remember the 3 s - Snort, Swallow, Squirt responsibly!<br /><br />Have a great time and come back and tell uncle Hoffa how it went. <br /><br />Take care....

				I think thats really bad advice : / Sure there are kids who are mature for their age, but most of the time it does matter somewhat. You`re more likely to get sucked into just about anything at your age. Believing you can overcome self-indulgence and temptation so easily is a big mistake... Furthermore MDMA, MDA, Ketamine/MXE all are NOT deemed safe. Sure you can roll every now and then, but children see the affects much slower. By the time you`re an adult it will come all crashing down on you. Most of what you listed are hard drugs and can be easy to overdose for a teenager who`s new to it all.

				No matter how old you are, and you&#039;re thinking about getting into recreational drugs, here&#039;s my advice:<br /><br />Get your life sorted out first. Get comfortable, secure, safe. THEN if you&#039;ve found that life is easy start taking drugs. Unless you&#039;re from a well off family this probably won&#039;t happen until you&#039;re in your 20s, which is also good because that age is also about the time that your brain has done most of the growing that it&#039;s going to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that drugs will fuck up your life, rather that the chances of them fucking up your life are greatly increased if you&#039;re not established - ie already living comfortably and have a family/social network if you find you&#039;re not able to control yourself, or get into some other type of trouble.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve already proved yourself as a person to non-drug users, they will be much more likely to see you as a good person who just made some poor decisions, rather than a total write-off making fucked up decisions from the start.<br /><br />I&#039;m a drug user who started fairly late, and I think that&#039;s why I still get to enjoy drugs. I know people who just wanted to rebel when they were young, get fucked up... and now they can&#039;t control themselves, so they don&#039;t get to enjoy using drugs like I do.<br /><br />Recreational drugs are the dessert of life... and there&#039;s a reason why we eat dessert after the main meal.

Its just not enough. I think you missed the part where he mentioned MDMA/Ketamine/MDE/XE as soft drugs. Regardless of your age/job/financial status its just not right to assume &#039;we all know the rules&#039;, because its quite clear that some don`t even know where to start/stop to begin with. There are many overdoses/poisonings/accidents/crimes (like murder) involving this. Its just not something lax to advice anyone about.. No one here is fulfilling the age discrimination so to speak, everyone is being kind to turn away/give any advice that might be harmful. Having a 2-year degree in doing drugs is no excuse. All kids reading this should go to Erowid and do proper research before going on. It`s also good to ask specific advise on the forums, while you may not get a straight answer, you`ll get enough to make a proper judgement.

I think the sticky thread is a great idea, maybe not studies; but rules/guidelines to taking different drugs/dosage and so on. Though Erowid covers plenty, it would be great to have a dedicated FAQ section for these, or threads for kids with questions regarding a situation/matter. I am willing myself to write/take part in this project.

Mushrooms and acid. Had a lot of interesting experiences with it but it turned me into an introvert. <br /><br />Within a few years I got into ecstasy and coke and drinking and was always out at parties. Grades slipped, but I always had a job and supported my habits myself. The coke got the better of me for a few years and I started pawning some property.<br /><br />I then got into Benzos later in college, but had a seizure (was really taking high amounts of this stuff) and then swore it off. Also was ordering nitrous off the internet and doing whip-its - these are really fun but be careful with em. This might have also had some influence on the seizure so I swore that off too.<br /><br />Stopped drugs entirely once I entered the &quot;real&quot; workforce around 22 mostly because I was now with a different circle of people surrounding me. <br /><br />Since I found SR I&#039;m back into Ecstasy and Coke. I can afford it nowadays so it&#039;s a non issue. <br /><br />I&#039;d say if you&#039;re going to experiment just make sure whatever it is is clean and pure. Hard to do on the street, but easy here on SR. <br /><br />Stay away from heroin like it&#039;s the plague.

				The general reaction of the SR crowd to this curious teenager is another reason why this site is so much better than buying drugs on the street corner.&nbsp; On the corner there is no discussion, no risk/reward analysis, no encouraging this guy to wait until a time of his life when he can use a more inspired decision-making process.&nbsp; The dealer just takes his money and gives him the product.&nbsp; +1

				Thats a bit harsh lol<br /><br />Find out what you want to do yourself. Don&#039;t be a lazy ass cunt. Your age doesn&#039;t matter here, unless you make it the subject of the discussion like you did lol.<br /><br />It&#039;s your body, your family, your life... you decide what risks you take. Do some research on Erowid, look at what&#039;s popular on SR, look at Erowid some more, smoke some weed, look at Erowid some more, burn out from shitty aussie street weed, wake up, get on Erowid.<br /><br />Also... Don&#039;t take unnecessary risks. Don&#039;t be doing physically addictive substances too often, make sure you&#039;re not forming psychological addiction (unless you just don&#039;t give a fuck... that&#039;s kinda my situation with cannabis lol its cigarettes or cannabis). Australia likes to suck balls alot, so you can use adjusted names. (eg. You are Thomas Jack, call yourself James Jack idgaf. They have no way to verify if James Jack is real or not and deliver the package on time.)<br /><br />Other things to watch out for:<br />1) Starting dosage (keep this at a minimum, especially at your age, experience with drugs, etc.)<br />2) Frequency (if you&#039;re taking tussin weekly, and it is something that will just never change, regardless of the situation... take two my friend, you&#039;ve just formed a habit!)<br />3) Using drugs as a gateway (what I mean by this is to escape your problems. I know pretty much no one considers Nicotine a drug, but do you know how I got hooked? Because I needed something to help me get over my ex lol.)<br />4) Giant personality changes (This can sometimes be due to an epiphany... I&#039;ve had a couple... I&#039;m not as social as I used to be, and I dropped out of uni a few weeks ago. If you&#039;re making huge personality changes just because you want to... well I&#039;m not quite sure how to end this, but please go see a doctor)<br />5) Drugs you are on (I&#039;m not kidding when I say this.. but if you blindly mix drug A and drug B, you really do deserve to just die - the rest of your life won&#039;t be so hard anymore. You need to know how they work or if they&#039;re safe to mix, if they are dangerous - what can be done to minimize it etc. Also, don&#039;t forget that if you have any after-effects-- whatever you took is still affecting you)<br />6) Effect on you specifically<br />---------------------------------- I&#039;m going to use a personal example for this... When i started out smoking weed, my tolerance was so fucking weak that two hits of weed, one hit of Marb Reds, and I couldn&#039;t be more fucked in Guantanamo Bay lol. I had the most intense visuals that were reminiscent of Psychedelics such as shrooms. Time distortion, very very intense closed eye hallucinations - repetitive in nature, nauseating, I don&#039;t know if I had auditory hallucinations because I was tripping balls and just trying to sleep. No open eyed hallucinations, I just couldn&#039;t sit or stand with proper posture lol. For the next 5-10 sessions or so, I would puke shit out of my mouth with even a small whiff of Marijuana or Tobacco.&nbsp; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; After doing some research, I found out that NAUSEA occurs only in very few people. I don&#039;t know anyone who has had a similar experience to me on Cannabis... but you get the point. As long as you are careful about (1), this shouldn&#039;t be a major problem.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to recommend any drugs, but dude If you knew all that... idk why the fuck you made this thread. This is your thread: Title = Newfag here, gotta wait a year to fuck, might as well do drugs. Content = get high off your mums breastmilk newfag!!!!!111111111111

I listen to experimental metal primarily. Of course I listen to other artists, like the Hendrix, Kinks, Cream, Yes, Vanilla Smudge, the Prodigy, Chemical brothers, Allan Holdsworth among many others. Can`t really comment on Minutes to midnight, I had stopped listening to them before it came out.
