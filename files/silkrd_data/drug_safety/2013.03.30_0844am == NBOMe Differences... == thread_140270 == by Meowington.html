				Well, so far I have only tried 25i and 25c... and to me, they act somewhat similar in a way, but also very different. I have recently ordered some 25b to try out as well. I was just hoping to get others&#039; opinions on the differences of these three substances. :) Maybe some trip reports to go along as well. (mainly looking for 25b information.. not a lot out there on Erowid and what not) Thanks. :3 Hope to hear from you all soon.

				I recently just got to try 25b.<br /><br />The trip itself was very clear headed, and easy on my body. I felt sober, but the visuals were easily the most intense out of any other 25(x) I&#039;ve tried.<br /><br />I took 2mg, the trip was about 8 hours, and the come down was very easy.

				25b is one of my favorites. I agree about the clear headspace. I also find that it heightens my emotions and senses, not to mention euphoric in a 2c-b kind of way. <br /><br />The first time I did it I watched Secret World of Arrietty and wow, that movie came to life. Sounds felt like they were coming from all around me. Colors swirled throughout each scene and burst out of the screen at certain parts. Lots of adrenaline started pumping during various action sequences also, so much fun! Candy was also interesting, tastes would stretch forever ... for instance, I&#039;d pop a skittle and let it dissolve but instead of biting it after a time because the taste faded and I needed a burst, I could let it dissolve completely (though I didn&#039;t have much of an appetite for food in general). Another time I saw a comedy and I laughed myself to tears. Sex can be very tantric as well ... the euphoria combined with the heightened sense of touch ... it&#039;s very niiiiice. <br /><br />So yeah, it&#039;s one of my favorites. 1mg is my usual dose and lasts a good 6 hours.

How would you compare 25b to 2c-b? I have not tried either one yet but am planning on getting some for an upcoming festival. Which one is closer to a candyflip type experience?

				I haven&#039;t had AMT but 2c-b is more euphoric (than 25b); it also gives nice tracers that I imagine would be ideal for a festival experience (never been to a festival which is why I say imagine).
