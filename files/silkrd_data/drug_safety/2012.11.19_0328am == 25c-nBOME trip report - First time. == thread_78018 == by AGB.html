				I&#039;ve never done psychedelics before. This is my first report. I don&#039;t know who the intended audience is. I&#039;m usually petty terse. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to 26i and and 25b when my tolerance dies down. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Trip report. <br /><br />It&#039;s 1:07.<br /><br /><br />I put the tab under my upper gum at 12:00 or so and held it there for like fourty minutes. So, I guess that means that i&#039;m mid trip right now. <br /><br />Going into the trip I was a bit agitated and tired. I had spent most of the day driving and sitting in traffic jams. The man i had met for dinner was late. not a huge deal, but it did worry me and I have a tendency to let my anexieties get the better of me. I&#039;m working on it. thankfully it didnt turn into an all out panic attack. Kinda wish I still had my ativan for that... anyways. <br /><br />I&#039;m in a good mood now. I&#039;m clearly in the middle of the trip. the 25c actually cheered me up. It&#039;s interesting beacuse the 25c seems to do funny things to your senses and emotions, but not the cognatitive process. I think I could do some math equations right now... i probably would still score worse then if had not been in the middle of a trip, but still well enough to assure me that my mind is working properly. <br /><br />It&#039;s 1:20. The text above took me about 14 minutes to write. <br /><br />Yep, my brain is still working. <br /><br />I see lots of colours. it&#039;s hard to explain, but when you open microsoft word and you just look at the blank page... you know that page is white.&nbsp; right now when I look at an empty page i see swirls of colour. it&#039;s an intensly more vivid version of like when you close your eyes and press against them to see the fireworks. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think i&#039;m describing this properly. You might just have to see it for yourself. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 1:37.<br /><br />I&#039;m chatting with people on facebook a bit too openly. I feel like I have known and liked these people that I&#039;m chatting to for far longer then I actually have. Theres some conflicting thoughts going on here. I&#039;ll have to keep an eye on that. I shouldnt be looking into it so much. I should just enjoy the experence. <br /><br />Dammit, I wish someone was tripping with me. That would of been cool. <br /><br />I need to get a guy that likes doing this stuff too. <br /><br />I wonder what sex is like on this. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 1:44.<br /><br />I&#039;m shivering even though i&#039;m not cold. Wait. Am I cold?<br /><br />No, I&#039;m not cold. I&#039;m putting a coat on anyways. Why risk it...<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 1:55.<br /><br />I&#039;m conflicted right now. I was pretty tired even before i put the 25c in my mouth. <br /><br />Now i&#039;m relaxed as hell, I feel good - But I don&#039;t think that I could sleep. <br /><br />Really glad it&#039;s a fri...Er... Saterday now I suppose. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 2:01<br /><br />Time to jack off. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 2:09<br /><br />That was on... the kinkier side of normal. but still pretty enjoyable. wait, did it only take me 8 mins to jack off? <br /><br />i&#039;m trying to figure out if that&#039;s longer or shorter then normal. I have no fucking clue. <br /><br /><br />it&#039;s 2:11<br /><br />There is this video of human vocal cords in action on reddit. Thats gross and facinatating all at the same time. I should probably try to sleep. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 2:23 <br /><br />I keep on procrastinating with the sleep thing. Still looking at reddit. Oh god this is turning into basicallyeveryothernight.. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 2:54<br /><br />Sleep isn&#039;t coming. I&#039;m actually still really relaxed and calm. I like that aspect of the nbome. what I don&#039;t like is that even though the sheets are super warm and I have a kitty thats purring me to sleep IT STILL WON&#039;T COME. <br /><br />that being said, even though i&#039;m up much later then I usually am, I still feel like i&#039;m having a good time. It might be wiser to do this when its not late and I&#039;m not tired. Next time. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to have a beer and watch some breaking bad. Is watching a show about drugs when your on drugs approperiate? meeehhh....<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 3:07<br /><br />that beer has been sitting on my desk and I havent taken a sip of it. OK. Thats better. I like the cold feeling. neat. <br /><br />my back feels tight. Is that the nbome?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to watch some legend of korra instead... There is something about animation that appeals to me right now. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 3:55<br /><br />i&#039;m coming down. The window was open just a slight bit making my heater go on then off then on then off again. No wonder i was confused earlier. Still not sleepy. Still really calm and happy. no more visuals or.. at least they are demished. the beer was a good idea. Going to smoke some pot too.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 5:03<br /><br />I think it&#039;s basically over. I switched back to breaking bad. Skyler has huge boobs. They don&#039;t interest me at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s 6:46<br /><br />i&#039;m sober. Fuck skyler is hot when she keeps her goddamn mouth shut. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I just ordered a sheet of 25i from ENBOOM, I&#039;ll let you know how that transaction goes.<br /><br />Two was definitely intense for me, but it wasn&#039;t like I was losing control... it just felt very, very crazy. So maybe losing control, but I wouldn&#039;t call it a bad trip. The comedown has always been amazing to me, especially at night. I used to light up a cigarette at about 2 or 3am at night, just walk around my neighborhood, and feel at peace. That was in the summer, now it&#039;s way too fucking cold for that... :P<br /><br />+1 for the trip report
