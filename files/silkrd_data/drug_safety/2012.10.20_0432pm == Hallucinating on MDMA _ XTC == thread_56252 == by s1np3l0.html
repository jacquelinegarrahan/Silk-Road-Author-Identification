				Hey, <br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering if anyone knows why it&#039;s so common to see people with glasses on (although they don&#039;t have glasses on) while hallucinating on molly. I&#039;ve talked to several friends and every time someone starts seeing weird stuff, glasses randomly appear on peoples&#039; faces. Did you guys experience this too? I&#039;ve also seen other crazy stuff like people aging and looking like grandpas / grandmas. What&#039;s your experiences with hallucinating on MDMA? All the times I hallucinated I was fully aware that I was seeing things and most things disappeared when I focused on the object I was looking at - so it was funny and not unpleasant at all.<br />I&#039;d like to know what other people see - especially if anyone else is also seeing random glasses on random faces all the time :D&nbsp; <br />

				If you&#039;re seeing things that aren&#039;t really there then you probably took MDA not MDMA<br /><br />did your roll feel like it lasted a few hours longer than it usually does?

Many friends have experienced same things after taking either red or blue defqons. Didn&#039;t have these experiences with pure MDMA or other pills. According to pillreports the only active substance is MDMA though as far as I remember.<br />Anyways, thanks for your reply!

				Hello&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I was about to write a topic like this :) <br /><br />Last sunday night, I tried MDMA for the first time. I bought 2 blue defqons on SR. <br /><br />I wanted to try this alone the first time, I didn&#039;t want to make any trouble on the street, that&#039;s why I have chosen a safe area. <br /><br />I took the full pill at 7:30pm. It hit my brain at 8. That was an intense feeling, all the things around me looked different. I tried to do some stuffs, like writing, reading and watching tv. It was the time of news on tv and I watched it. That was crazy. It was not the &quot;real&quot; news. It was all the news I remembered during the week and I was able to choose the ones I wanted to watch. Sometimes, all the news were mixed and the women on tv started saying stuffs with no sense. I was able to change the images too. But if I concentrated myself too much, I felt something uncomfortable. <br /><br />After that, I wanted to check my phone... Well, it was not my phone. My phone has a damaged screen and the one I saw looked perfect, different... Then I wanted to listen to some music with my ipod (a blue one). It was a grey one. <br /><br />I was able to mix music in my head. For example, I was listening to some dubstep and I put some rap lyrics on it, it was so great. <br /><br />When the trip went down, I decided to take another pill (I know that&#039;s too much). But the fact is that it wasn&#039;t like the first pill. I didn&#039;t feel the hit. But I saw one guy walking on my apartment, my lights moving and the sticks on my windows moving up and down each time I was looking at them. <br /><br />This week, every night, I had weird dreams. In most of them, I dreamt that I was on MDMA. They were more intense, more realistic. <br /><br />That was an amazing experience, and I will do it again :) I loved to way how MDMA can reach our unconscious mind :D

But as you said, you probably took too much unless you weigh 300 pounds :D With pills that state they have +200mg (although the defqons probably are around 170-180mg) you should probably have started with a half. Don&#039;t let that become a habit with taking 2 full defqons and wait enough time for your body and brain to recover until you roll the next time. I&#039;m not a pro but that&#039;s all I can say about MDMA - don&#039;t take it too often, if you do, it will lose its magic eventually. Seen that happen to a lot of people. <br />Next time try to get some pure molly, the come up is way more comfortable - at least for me it is.<br />Anyways, those defqons sure shift your vision and are one of my favorite beans out there :D

				The ones I had were more than 200 and yeah it was a mistake to take them both ;). But defqons are hard to break into 2 parts ! How do you break it ? The ones I had were not hardly pressed.

Just read on pillreports [CLEARNET: pillreports.com] and you&#039;ll understand. There&#039;s different batches and there&#039;s always a variation in how much is in one. Could be 170, could be 210. I&#039;m going with my vendors statement of ~170-180mg - sounds realistic for later batches. <br />To break them you could use a pill cutter, a good knife or your teeth :D Honestly last time I just bit half off and kept the rest for redosing. Tastes disgusting but works. You can crush the pills but you&#039;ll always have the risk of losing some powder getting stuck to wherever you put it. I&#039;ve even seen people snort crushed pills but .. yeah.. that&#039;s a waste even with 84% pure MDMA in my opinion. The defqons are not a hard press but they can be split if you do it carefully. If you really want to dose better, you should either buy pills with less mg (like those hearts at around 120-130mg which is a perfect amount for me) so you can swallow the complete one or you buy a scale and some pure MDMA and weigh how much you need. Anyways, the only way to change the effects is if you dont use it orally (swallowing the pill) and decide to snort the powder. The effect will kick instantly but as said before, I don&#039;t recommend it.<br /><br />The press merely changes the times it takes until it kicks in, I guess a harder press will take longer to dissolve in your stomach so be extra careful with those redbulls and DON&#039;T underestimate them - they are very hard pressed and sure will take a while until they kick in! If you don&#039;t feel anything even if you popped the pill an hour ago, WAIT until you redose. It will kick in eventually.<br />I&#039;ve ordered those redbulls too, they should get here next week :D

				I have been taking MDMA for nearly 20 years and have never heard of anyone experiencing the kind of visual hallucinations described in some of these posts. MDA can cause some visuals, but only closed-eye type in my experience. The sort of visual disturbances described here sound more like delirium. I don&#039;t know what was in the pills you guys took, but you shouldn&#039;t see things like glasses appear on someone&#039;s face when there were none before from only MDMA.

I felt fine after the roll. Although I&#039;ve also had some really nice pills too - honestly the defqon (my last roll) was fine besides the really rough anxiety like come up and nausea. I didn&#039;t find the hallucinations disturbing or bothering.

All pressed Ecstasy pills will contain something else in addition to MDMA. It&#039;s usually just caffiene or other stimulant. Sometimes Ketemine. In the worst cases it will be PMA or something similar (these are very bad). I&#039;m not sure what could cause such vivid hallucinations in an Ecstasy pill though. 2C-E?<br />MDA will give you some visuals for sure, but only behind your closed eyes. For me the MDA visuals are vivid realistic objects like faces and things, but morphing and changing into oher things so fast it&#039;s almost impossible to tell what anything is. Sometimes it will slow down enough for me to interpret what I&#039;m seeing. I once saw (with my eyes closed of course) about 20 cartoon ghosts standing in two concentric circles. They all were waving their arms in the air and spinning. One other time I saw a giant purple vagina with tentacles. It was using the tentacles like octopus arms to feed itself naked human bodies.

It&#039;s weird though, I wish I could say I made this all up and am the only case but I personally know of 4 other people (same pills) that made similar experiences and apparently dialektik had this too. At least we know which pill caused this, I still wonder why it wouldn&#039;t be reported as an adulterated pill on pillreports - it&#039;s kinda hard to believe all those defqons floating around are all fakes - even tried different vendors! I&#039;ll report back when I&#039;ve tested those blue decibels and orange redbulls!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sure they&#039;re not &quot;fake&quot;. All pressed Ecstasy pills will contain something else in addition to MDMA. It&#039;s usually just caffiene or other stimulant. Sometimes Ketemine. In the worst cases it will be PMA or something similar (these are very bad). I&#039;m not sure what could cause such vivid hallucinations in an Ecstasy pill though. 2C-E?<br />MDA will give you some visuals for sure, but only behind your closed eyes. For me the MDA visuals are vivid realistic objects like faces and things, but morphing and changing into oher things so fast it&#039;s almost impossible to tell what anything is. Sometimes it will slow down enough for me to interpret what I&#039;m seeing. I once saw (with my eyes closed of course) about 20 cartoon ghosts standing in two concentric circles. They all were waving their arms in the air and spinning. One other time I saw a giant purple vagina with tentacles. It was using the tentacles like octopus arms to feed itself naked human bodies.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I just read a lot about 2C-E and 2C family. That&#039;s strange. Some effects are common like taste of food, closed eyes visions, introspective vision which depend on your mood and settings... It gives me the willing to try 2C-E :D

				That is so WEIRD, man! I just took 250+ MG of UndergroundSyndicate&#039;s (try to say his highly reputable MDMA is MDA lol) over the weekend and saw glasses on people&#039;s faces too! I&#039;d look up, a pair of glasses would be sitting perfectly on their face, then they&#039;d vanish. I also saw a decent amount of trailing lights behind moving objects, and a slightly different texture to everything. This was the first time I&#039;d ever taken more than 180 MG of MDMA, I guess it has hallucinogenic properties in higher doses. Also, stop claiming people took shit other than what they say they took because YOU didn&#039;t experience the same effects as him/her. I test all my drugs and I&#039;m sure the OP&#039;s MDMA was tested too.
