				Good Evening road,<br /><br />I first want to say that my life has been changed for the better by discovering this site. I&#039;ve done MDMA about 5 times (spaced out at least 1 month a apart) and I feel like it has brought insight into my life for the better. The only other drugs I have done are MJ, alcohol, and Ritalin (prescribed)<br /><br />Anyway, I have a bunch of EDM shows/ raves coming up and I really want to be fucked up for them. The thing is I feel like I am already doing MDMA too much and was wondering if you guys or girls could recommend an alternative to MDMA so that I don&#039;t over do it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard some talk of doing LSD at raves but I have never tried LSD before and heard its not a good idea for your first time to be in a club.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you :)

				The other drug that was big in the raves that I&#039;ve been too was ketamine - but I never tried it so I don&#039;t know much about its effects.

				I don&#039;t rate K for raves, you look like a knob and you&#039;d get just as much out of it at home - actually more as you can comfortably K-Hole.<br /><br />Stick with the MDMA, but add a little 2CB after you peak. LSD can be great but if you&#039;ve not tried it before it&#039;s better to have a good trip in a more relaxed environment as a first time, taking a little to party won&#039;t be as good.

				Would NOT recommend taking LSD for the first time at a rave. I would do it at least 2-3 times at home before ever going public with it, you want to know how to handle yourself and what kind of experiences to expect in a stimulus free environment. Once you add insanely loud music and flashing lights your could be in for something you&#039;re not really comfortable with, also faces can look really strange and discomforting on L.<br /><br />Also fuck doing k at raves, if I do take it I kitty flip and even then it just takes away from the M. I honestly really like coke just because it supplements with alcohol really well and I find the high to be really controllable in groups of people. Just buy a little metal snuffer and bring it with you.

				The potent K from SR can definitely have a fine line between the right amount and too much. I too have seen a few people get carried out because of too much K, but usually this is due to not knowing your dose/potency. Once you can nail that down, you&#039;re good to go.

				Things which are like MDMA but aren&#039;t: Methylone, Mephedrone, 4-FA, 4-MEC<br />Things which are like MDMA but also trippy: MDA, 6-APB, 2C-B, 2C-D (so I hear), 2C-G-NBOMe (so I hear), and 2C-I-NBOMe and 4-AcO-DMT to some extents.<br />Things which are also fun at raves: Shrooms, LSD, Ketamine, MXE, Amphetamine, Ethylphenidate, GHB. And meth and coke I guess, but I don&#039;t really advocate their use.<br /><br />But really you&#039;re fine taking MDMA once a month. Hell, the once a month thing is really overstated. If you are taking reasonable doses and waiting 2 weeks between uses you&#039;re not looking at serotonin depletion snowballing or anything. Hell, the neurotoxicity concerns are mostly unfounded (and are based on MDA&#039;s neurotoxicity).<br /><br />If you really fear neurotoxicity, try 4-FA - it&#039;s been proven to be non-neurotoxic, and it drains much less serotonin so it can be taken more regularly. It&#039;s speedier compared to MDMA.

				2C-B, 5-MeO-MIPT, Mescaline (San Pedro / Peruvian Torch cactus)<br /><br />Please do Ketamine at home, properly, lying down, IM 100mg - 200mg. Taking it at a party is just stupid IMHO and is a waste of a profound substance. And if you do more than you can handle while functioning you&#039;re going to look like a dick and potentially hurt yourself....

				I wouldnt do psychedelics at a rave personally, i prefer something sociable and euphoric. But thats just me. I&#039;m in a similar situation I need to back off the mdma for a while, I&#039;m not sure about methlyone? I hear it works on serotonin too so would not help out someone trying to mix up from MDMA for a while? Personally I think I&#039;m gonna go down the coke + alcohol route for a month before getting back on the MDMA, as I like to keep sociable at raves, I dont really wanna just trip out its about meeting and chatting to people for me too. But each to their own.<br /><br />Although I hear K can be good in low doses at raves, I&#039;ve tried it but not at a rave. Its kind of a drug with 2 sides, you can use it as a party drug taking 50mg every 30 mins or so and be fucked up but functioning or you can do 200mg and end up in a K-hole, 2 very different drug experiences in one substance really...

				MDMA on a weekly basis will take a toll slowly, not dramatically but you should take breaks if you&#039;ve been rolling a lot.<br /><br />I personally like 2C-I, ~16mg range its only mildly psychedelic at that range, and it&#039;s very stimulating for a good 4-5 hrs.&nbsp; I get varied euphoria on it.<br /><br />2C-B works for a lot of people too, I don&#039;t get anything from it, if anything it makes me very introverted.<br /><br />K would work if you keep it to small bumps and space it out through the night so you&#039;re not too fucked up.<br /><br />LSD if you are good about handling your shit on it.&nbsp; I find it very euphoric and mildly stimulating but I can&#039;t hold a conversation on it without looking/sounding very obviously fucked up.&nbsp; Some people can though.<br /><br />Coke/Meth -- I&#039;d personally go with meth, one line before the party is enough to carry you all night and keep you euphoric and upbeat.&nbsp; Coke is the same but you need to keep redosing it to stay in a mood.&nbsp; Riskier since you have to keep it on you at the event and redose throughout the night.&nbsp; Depending on the venue/security this can be more risky than it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; In that sense, meth is tons better if you don&#039;t mind the fact you&#039;ll be up somewhat late.

But thats just me. I&#039;m in a similar situation I need to back off the mdma for a while, I&#039;m not sure about methlyone? I hear it works on serotonin too so would not help out someone trying to mix up from MDMA for a while? Personally I think I&#039;m gonna go down the coke + alcohol route for a month before getting back on the MDMA, as I like to keep sociable at raves, I dont really wanna just trip out its about meeting and chatting to people for me too. But each to their own.<br /><br />Although I hear K can be good in low doses at raves, I&#039;ve tried it but not at a rave. Its kind of a drug with 2 sides, you can use it as a party drug taking 50mg every 30 mins or so and be fucked up but functioning or you can do 200mg and end up in a K-hole, 2 very different drug experiences in one substance really...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting... I find LSD euphoric most trips, especially in the right environment... like a rave/club.<br /><br />LSD is what you make it... I find I am very sociable on it when I want to be... I only struggle to form sentences when on higher doses or when trying to communicate a specific idea that has been generated from the trip... normal conversation flows better than normal for me, generally.<br /><br />Of course if you go on an introspective trip, then communication isn&#039;t the best.<br /><br />The way LSD enhances the music, giving you some awesome visuals... combining with some of the other drugs mentioned just makes it an awesome time.

Some of the etards pre post load better than the ones that show no signs.<br /><br />The proper advice is to be cautious and use the drug SPARINGLY for SPECIAL experiences to be safe. Sure you could prob use it once a week or every other week if you do it right but why risk it? Its your life.<br /><br />Anyways M1 is a good option if your tolerance is lower, very similar to mdma and less neurotoxic. Its more like Coke sorta. Generally, analogs tend to be safer because of lower potency and shorter durations. I dont say this for all, I say this from my limited experience with MDA and MDMA analogs.<br /><br />2cb mdma mda m1 ghb are good for clubs. Ket too. I have never done Ket though but have heard about it from friends.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Recommending an RC (namely, methylone) as a safe(r) alternative to MDMA is absolutely absurd. The idea that cathinones are safer is mostly conjecture, as is the idea that lower serotonin action and more dopamine action is safer. (Overactive dopamine receptors are the cause of psychosis, in fact.) Plus, if you listened to me, I said reasonable doses every 2 weeks... perhaps I should have been more specific? A reasonable dose is under 300mg. (And at higher doses, a little more waiting might help.)<br /><br />Lower potency and shorter duration have nothing to do with neurotoxicity. Coke lasts an hour tops, and it is quite neurotoxic when binged upon. And while methamphetamine is less potent than amphetamine (by mass, anyway), it&#039;s much more neurotoxic. Neurotoxicity comes from a lot of factors, not all of which are understood - but rest assured, it has much to do with the actual structure of the molecule. MDMA is simply not neurotoxic at normal recreational doses (though MDA is). It is in binging that people hurt themselves.<br /><br />You have good intentions but to call what I said bullshit is really unnecessary.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93028.msg669761#msg669761">Quote from: Hulk101 on December 19, 2012, 10:33 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Stay with MDMA!
