				Hi Fellow Silk Roaders,<br /><br />I have managed to acquire some DMT and also a vaporizer known as &#039;the Machine&#039; (basically a small Hennessy bottle with mesh in the neck and a drilled hole at the bottom).<br /><br />I have never used DMT or the machine before - and wondered if someone would be kind enough that has experience to share with me the best way to use the machine without burning the DMT, as I know burning it is a complete waste as it needs to be Vaporized.<br /><br />So if any one could give me either a step by step guide on how to do this or any tips, I would be extremely grateful.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />J&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The good of &quot;the machine&quot; is that it is difficult to burn the DMT for how it is done: when you melt the DMT the powder &quot;disappear&quot;, but because of the heat transfer properties of the metal, the DMT evenly condenses on the cold, coiled metal. Then, after the DMT is evenly distributed, the same conductive properties ensure it vaporizes at near the same time, allowing the full dose to be ingested at once, in a single lungful, rather than being subject to the conductive and heat transfer properties of the glass, or much thicker metal.<br /><br />To charge DMT just simply apply the spice (start low to try) on the neck (above the brillo) and then gently heat it until it melts inside (don&#039;t touch the DMT with a flame, stay above); usually just one single &quot;flash&quot; of the lighter is enough since DMT melts very easily (at 60-80 C). <br /><br />To smoke simply reverse the bottle and heat the brillo while you take a full toke (suck as you light the DMT in the brillo, this is the point those accustomed with a crack pipe usually go wrong because they are accustomed to wait; with &quot;the machine&quot; the vaporization is immediate, so begin toking immediately) then hold the breath for at last 10 seconds. Done.<br /><br />Very straightforward. Practice makes perfect but with &quot;the machine&quot;, as I said, it is very difficult to waste the DMT because it is more difficult you burn it (the only way to burn it is at beginning when you try to melt it inside). Also if you cannot take a full toke at beginning (for inexperience) just take another, nothing is wasted.<br /><br />You can also google around, there are many articles on the clearnet about &quot;the machine&quot; and how to use it. This is the original one where &quot;the machine&quot; first appeared:<br />http://mycotopia.net/forums/attachments/botanicals-cactus-misc-entheogens-psychedelics/180638d1280195772-freebase-pipe-options-spice-131385d1245222385-how-do-you-breaking-through-124761d1240376674-where-buy-dmt-oil-burner-pipe-ma.jpg<br /><br />

				So BlackIris - once the DMT has melted onto the brillo without the flame directly touching the DMT, you can hold the machine sucking through the bottom hole with the flame directly hitting the brillo that has the DMT melted on, and simply inhale the vapour? <br /><br />Or is it better to heat the glass around the top of the neck in order to heat the brillo withouth the flame directly touching the brillo.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only bit I&#039;m slightly confused about.....if that makes sense!! <br /><br />Regards,<br />J

				I made a &quot;machine&quot; with a small glass bottle time ago, I managed to vaporize the dmt but when I tried inaling the white smoke it&nbsp; burned my troath,it was too harsh and hot,much more worse than cigars... <br />so I went only in the stadium 0 of experience: increasead color saturation, head heaviness and similar<br />I wasted the most of dmt I made<br /><br />The E-cigarette method should be more gentle,look on dmtnexus

This burns the throat (and in some cases can also make you puke). The toke should be gentle and long, not &quot;all at once&quot;, in this way the smoke is much less harsh (actually after a bit of experience it becomes good to smoke).<br /><br />If however you are still concerned about the harshness of the smoke use mint before toking DMT.

				Thanks for your advice BlackIris - due to your advice I have just had the most incredible experience I&#039;ve ever had with regards to hallucinogenics.<br /><br /><br />So hard to put it into words, as I have no idea what the fuck happened - except it was truly exceptional. <br /><br />Fuck I now LOVE DMT&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />and the machine worked a fucking treat&nbsp; :o

				Glad I could be of help.<br /><br />And yes, DMT is one of the best hallucinogenic also for me; you can do with it whatever you want for what it concerns OBEs and things linked.<br /><br />See you in hyperspace&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />EDIT: Remember to change the brillo after about 30 uses because after a bit a resin stuck inside that turns the quality of the trip in a different direction and also obstacle the correct heat transfer. Simply use a piece of brillo (even if you take too much you can cut it later) remembering to ignite it directly with a flame to remove the fabric impurities, then shape it accordingly to the neck of the bottle. Very easy. But for now you have much to go on till this is a concern.

				So I want to make a machine, but I don&#039;t have a drill. Does anyone think I could punch a hole in the bottom with a phillips head screwdriver, or should I just wait until I&#039;ve got a drill? If I should just wait for a drill, I&#039;ll probably end up doing the foil method (foil over the bottom of a 2 liter).

				I think most glass bottles will have something different about the middle of the bottom that may make it easier to shatter a hole.&nbsp; Technically you could shatter then entire end and patch it up with electrical or duck tape I suppose but that obviously isn&#039;t ideal.<br /><br />Be careful not to buy a hard-plastic glass-like bottle as is common.&nbsp; Most of the small bottles in my house are plastic but I&#039;ve found a few that I think are suitable for the machine.&nbsp; I may build one tomorrow.&nbsp; DMT should be on its way soon but maybe I can use it to practice with 2c-b...not sure if that&#039;ll work or not.
