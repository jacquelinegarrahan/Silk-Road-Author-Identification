				I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research on these herb and oil vaporizers lately and have been looking for one that would be best suited to put my crystals in and heat up but not burn it up or get all screwed up.&nbsp; I have one specifically in mind due to the fact that it&#039;s temperature is completely adjustable between 100 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp; The DaVinci.&nbsp; If&nbsp; I&#039;m not mistaken meth starts to vaporize around 175-180? Has anyone successfully used one of these for crystal meth?&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate all feedback. <br /><br />Thanks

				Oh I&#039;m an expert at that and was wanting something that didn&#039;t require a lighter maybe i could smoke in the bathroom of the plane! haha No i&#039;m kidding but really it&#039;d be cool to just Click and BAM not have to worry about wind blowing out my dam bic or accidentally leaving soot on the bottom of my dick and having to wipe it down! You know the drill.&nbsp; Btw I think my kid days are over already 21 was over a decade ago!

				Friend of mine uses one for oil and it is amazing, super discrete. Minus the smell it is completely stealth. Obviously we use it for thc products but the same logic would apply crystal I imagine. Can&#039;t see why it would heat any differently than a glass dick. But in a pinch go buy a &quot;windproof&quot; torch lighter for like a dollar at a dollar store. No soot, my boyfriend does roofing and still smokes on windy days :)
