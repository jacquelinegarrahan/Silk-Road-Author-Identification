				and if you use many different kinds, may i ask this question: why? <br /><br />Why not stick to just one drug?<br /><br />Why use many different kinds of drugs all the time?<br /><br />Can there be any rational reason to do this to your body-system?

				Lots of drugs!<br /><br />So many different psychedelics and disassociatives and other tools that can be used to explore consciousness, if that&#039;s your type of thing.

				I mainly use psychedelics and MDMA, but wouldn&#039;t say no to the odd line of coke and K. I use them because I enjoy the effects of each one, especially psychedelics :)<br /><br />Each to their own I guess :)

				i smoke cannabis off and on for 10 years now. that would be my one regular drug<br /><br />i really love to try new stuff and combinations! especially in the festival seasons.<br /><br />last year the ozora festival was my longest so far - 8 days - i thought it would be pretty challenging..<br />but it was actually very pleasant. mixed speed, ketamine, lsd, opium, mdma, DoI, meskaline, weed and cocaine over those 8 days. i have to say this festival is like a wonderland, you get every drug but whats interesting i&#039;ve seen no one overdoing it! very good energies there<br /><br />cheers

				Sorry for triple post but have to explain:<br /><br />heroin (street) - heroin i consider unknown opiate most likely diamorphine with alot of different cuts - I never tried diamorphine ( real heroin) - I will consider that I tried diamorphine when I get my hands on pharmacutical diamorphine without any cuts.<br /><br />meth-amphetamine (street) - i don&#039;t know what I&#039;m getting what kind of meth&nbsp; ( powdered shit).<br /><br />benzodiazepines and z drugs - minus means I can get them from a doctor but haven&#039;t tried yet.<br /><br />Well thanks for listening and sorry for triple post . :)<br /><br />P.S. i write ROA I tried these drugs -&nbsp; benzodiazepine pills obviosly orally, never injected only ampoules.

				Lots of good answers allready... <br />so now I have the &quot;luxury&quot; to comment on them depending on my personal opinion... <br /><br />I totally agree with CiscoYankerStuck: there are many ways to discover how your brain/personality works. Drugs is one of these ways and each molecule can teach you something different. Some molecules can, if combined in the right way, offer you even further insight/different perspectives. <br />When you choose to take products for that reason you do become a psychonaut and exploring the &quot;inner space&quot; becomes a life-lasting undertakement... BUT: many people on this forum tend to believe that taking drugs is the only way to explore those thoughts/emotions/instincts/... and I do not agree with them about that; many ways can be walked at the same time and I think only relying on drugs is a pitty. <br /><br />I can say almost the same as zebra420kitty: every possible/imaginalbe molecule has gone through my body - well, not all of them, but most of the non-prescribable molecules. I&#039;m not so experienced nor interested in most of the legal products (such as some of the list of grdr) and pure heroin has never been in my body (not that I wasn&#039;t tempted to do such...but &quot;know yourself&quot;), but I probably have ingested it sometimes in the past when they used to put some in pills... <br /><br />Crack is indead just cocaine that has been cleaned and is smoked. I did that a lot when I was young - but thankfully I was able to turn my back to it. Since then I never did it again and just smelling it already makes my stomach turn. Crack is said to be more addictive than H and if you want to stop using it there is no legal alternative such as methadone. Cold Turkey is the only way to go...and it&#039;s not fun at all... <br /><br />Nowadays I almost have a similar situation to MaidMandy, except I do use quite some different psychedelics such as LSD, shrooms, DMT, changa, mescaline, MDMA, Keta, 2C-B ... but not (often) together&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I think it&#039;s all about sailing on the sea of your inner spaces... there are many boats on that sea and the luxury is that we can choose what type of boat we want to sail on. And if you want something else than sailing, you can use a submarine, or go swimming, or go surfing, or go diving, or go fishing, or go... the more often you&#039;re in touch with that sea and the more diverse your experiences are, the more you&#039;re able to understand the sea - this is: if you take enough time in between your experiences to think about them/digest them/place them/learn from them... <br /><br />PS: what Minchia says seems to be totally right: Ozora is a damn good place to be!!!&nbsp; :P

				I used to smoke weed daily (and tobacco) but have quit both for 3 years now :) . I drink alcohol very rarely<br /><br />nowadays I only use cocaine/mephdrone and valium. But im talking small doses, maybe a gram of mephedrone a week if that and cocaine rarely.<br /><br />However for some reason I feel more like a &#039;druggie&#039; then when I was doing more substances :/
