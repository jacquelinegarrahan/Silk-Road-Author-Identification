				i just bought an 8 ball of the best blow i had seen in the town i just moved to and decided to go ham and share with friends. Everyone agrees this cocaine has much more euphoria as opposed to the rush of the usual blow. It got us all pretty stupid high but the freezing numbness of fishscale just wasnt there. Upon taking a medium sized numby my mouth was completely frozen even my teeth. The physical discription of the blow is off-white&nbsp; powder/rocks and on the rocks i can see a few of what appears to be fishscale. The coke smells just like cocaine but oddly enough was even stronger of a smell than i had smelled on much better cocaine. The high was a little weird from normal coke high is what a couple in the group said. come down wasnt too bad but we have had racing hearts trying to pass out for class. <br /><br />My guess is this is medium quality blow but possible cut with another drug. i am really just interested in educating myself more about cocaine and cutters and all that jazz<br /><br />Help me out spread the knowlege this forum is an amazing place where we could really make shit happen, haha too bad humanity would never give it the chance

Since almost nothing else is this soluble any cut will cause the water level to rise noticeably. Try looking at the water level of the water in the syringe vs the water + coke in the syringe, you will see the coke<br /><br />b) I sent it as a single rock on purpose. Dust the rock off with a turkey baster or paint brush and you will see it has a dull glossy sheen which is proof that it is genuine. You must dust it off to see this because the powder hide it. Represses do not have this sheen.<br /><br />c) if you hold it in bright light you will see sparkles. Cocaine is referred to as &quot;white and clear&quot; in color, the clear is these sparkles.<br /><br />

				I used to be a coke dealer and I would add the fishscale effect to my blow to get you more fucked up.<br /><br />I would actually dry out real fish, then rub the scales off with a knife.<br />Gently grind the fishscales but not too fine.<br />Mix with your coke and hey presto.<br /><br />Some people I know used a proper descaler tool while the fish is still wet but I find that a bit rank.

				It&#039;s still pretty. :)<br /><br />But Limetless is right. I&#039;ve done a lot of coke, and it doesn&#039;t so much matter whether it&#039;s rock or powder, sparkly and crackly (under a card), or straight white and mushy. The only real test is to put it up your nose. However, the sparkly and crackly stuff tends to be better.

				I wonder if coke is ever cut with stuff to keep you awake.<br /><br />Some of the&nbsp; lines people do around here are fucking massive.<br />If it was coke then surely they would OD.

Yes, while it&#039;s true that blow is slightly crystalline it shouldn&#039;t have a sheen on it like it&#039;s just been sent to get waxed. <br /><br />Speaking as someone who&#039;s done the extraction Coke does NOT come out looking MOP, that shit happens right at the factory and the shit&#039;s already been stepped on so even the distributors don&#039;t know the difference or if they do they don&#039;t care because it means it takes their price down per kilo. <br /><br />So yeah, sorry to vendors on here that advertise theirs as MOP because the response should be &quot;Why are you talking about something that molluscs produce when I want high quality disco-shit&quot;. If they look at you gone out, you know they aren&#039;t aware of the MOP myth themselves and if they look at you sideways you know for a fact they already knew. <br /><br />Simples.<br /><br />

Cocaine has a short half life (90 minutes) relative to most stimulants, so no matter how good it is, you should be coming down in 45-60 minutes. On the cleanest, strongest coke I&#039;ve done, I was able to sleep 2 hours later. So if the shit gives you a rush, and you&#039;re ganking for more an hour later, it&#039;s pretty clean. If your heart is racing and you feel that artery by your temple beating when you put your head on your pillow 3, 4, 5 hours later, it&#039;s cut with cheap stimulants.
