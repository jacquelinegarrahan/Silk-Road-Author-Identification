				Hi to the best forum in the known universe. *waves<br /><br />OK, my all time favorite drug of choice is MDMA, but I&#039;m currently stuck on a course of SSRI&#039;s so that particular avenue of pleasure is cut off for now. I also like stims in general, but I&#039;m too old for a 24/48 hour session these days. What else may be out there that sits ok with SSRI&#039;s, yet gives a similar social friendly buzz that MDMA does? I do enjoy a line or two of coke, but I also like the more cerebral high that for me, is what&#039;s so unique about wonderful MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking possibly one of the 2C family. I&#039;ve tried 2CB, but only in conjunction with MDMA, and that was lovely. I just don&#039;t know how it will stack up as a complete replacement. <br /><br />So something that gives a bit of a stim kick, and yet also offers the warm altered states that MD does. <br /><br />I&#039;m counting the days till I can come off the SSRI&#039;s! I certainly have the incentive :)<br /><br />Thoughts most welcome.

				Not sure if you like to &quot;trip&quot; but 2c-B alone is really nice it doesn&#039;t really have that &quot;mind fuck&quot; effect but it feels really good like MDMA. Its also great with sex as well. <br /><br />I really enjoy the body high I get from shrooms as well, personally ill eat about 2 grams and feel great, and 4-5 grams if I want to &quot;trip&quot;

				Thanks ilovedrugs. And sorry for not thanking you for your reply sooner. Real life kicked in and this is the first time I&#039;ve logged back in.<br /><br />I guess 2cb is top of the list, simply because I do have some left. I like trips sure, but not too often. Mostly I like the stimulated trippiness that is the wonderful MDMA.<br /><br />Any other thoughts folks? So many drugs out there, there must be some nice ones I haven&#039;t tried that sit well with SSRi&#039;s?

				Yeah 2C-B is quite nice. I would highly recommend anyone to try it at least once in their life. 2C-B is the beez neez. I would recommend 2C-I if you want a more stimulated buzz. I&#039;m assuming MDA is out of the question. How about 6-apb?

				I&#039;ve heard that foxy-methoxy (aka 5-MeO-MiPT ) is &quot;the tryptamines answer to MDMA&quot; so to speak. But the body load is supposed to be a bugger if you use it at too high of a dose.<br /><br />That&#039;s just what I&#039;ve found from Erowid, that is. <br /><br />I hear that some of the shroom analogs like 4-HO-MET or 4-HO-MiPT or 4-AcO-DMT tend to have a MDMA-esque bodyload, too. Of course the experience is more wholly psychedelic, but they have the same sort of &#039;feel&#039; to them. They also don&#039;t last that long, say, 4 - 8 hours depending on body chemistry, so you wont have to devote an entire day to it.

				Nothing is going to match the experience of MDMA of course.&nbsp; But if you like MDMA and like stims in general, then the mephedrone from limitless might be a good option.&nbsp; Mephedrone does both serotonin (MDMA) and dopamine (cocaine).&nbsp; Most of the meph out there isn&#039;t very good apparently but the stuff from limetless is top notch.&nbsp; There are three other vendors reselling his stuff as well.<br /><br />Since you&#039;re taking an SSRI I assume it helps you and that you are prioritizing your overall mental/emotional being over getting high occasionally.&nbsp; That&#039;s good.&nbsp; But remember that rec drugs &quot;in general&quot; are more likely to make things worse.<br /><br />I&#039;m also curious to try 2c-b.

Meph primarily is a dopaminergic compound. Going off my limited knowledge it&#039;s more comparable to bk-MDMA ( methylone ) than legitimate MDMA. <br /><br />If I remember correctly, it&#039;s more dopaminergic than Methylone, with less serotonergic activity... that would explain the fact that you can binge way harder on Meph and not lose the quality of high ( as much ) like what happens when you binge on Methylone. <br /><br />And OP, if you&#039;re looking for other good stims that have a sorta rushing euphoric effect you could try some of the fluoramphetamines. The ones with 2 at the start are more dopaminergic, and the ones starting with 4 are more serotonergic. 2-FA would be good, or 4-FA. 4-FMA is supposed to be nice, but that would be more akin to MDMA and I don&#039;t exactly know how it would affect you while you&#039;re on SSRI&#039;s.

				Also, if you want to get off SSRI&#039;s, I would recommend going to your doctor and complaining about &#039;sexual side-effects&#039; as a lot of people experience such problems ( lack of horniness if you&#039;re a girl, inability to achieve erection or ejaculation if you&#039;re a man ). From my experience, there is little they can do as far as prescribing better SSRI&#039;s. I&#039;m pretty sure at that point they would wean you off of them and put you on some sort of benzodiazepine such as klonopin or Xanax, which shouldn&#039;t interfere with MDMA AFAIK. Also I would say that the side-effect profile is a lot better with BZD&#039;s than with SSRI&#039;s, and they don&#039;t take forever and a day to build up in your system. The only thing bad about them is they have some of the worst withdrawals, possibly even worse than an SSRI cold-turkey withdrawal, so if you ever want to go off mood-stabilizers completely it could pose a problem.<br /><br />I would def choose benzos over SSRI&#039;s any day of the week, though. I guess I don&#039;t see the point in using chemicals that don&#039;t get you high at all and more often than not cause parodoxical reactions that can result in suicidal ideation and other such maladies. And I hate benzos.

I&#039;ve had a few people in my life commit suicide or have to have me talk them out of suicide because of long-term dependence on SSRI&#039;s, so I just have an aversion to them. I&#039;m not doubting that benzos have some of the worst withdrawals out of all drugs, and that&#039;s horrible, but at least if you miss a dose of your xanax you wont fly off the rocker and try and kill yourself ( usually ) as WELL as get terribly ill. Most people in my family are on SSRI&#039;s and if they miss their dose for a day they turn into bawling messes and don&#039;t know what to do with themselves. It&#039;s sad.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m not prescribed to either benzos or SSRI&#039;s, since I tend to avoid both of those categories - the benzos &#039;cause they make me nauseous and the SSRI&#039;s because of the aforementioned reasons. <br /><br />Obviously my advice is not to be taken without seeing a doctor first, but if you notice shitty effects from SSRI&#039;s there&#039;s no reason for you not to try and get something else. There&#039;s other ways of treating most psychiatric disorders and in the field the two most important things about alleviating the symptoms of such disorders are : finding the most effective medicine with the lowest side effect profile for your individual body, which is harder than it sounds because everyone&#039;s body reacts differently to most medications for psychiatric disorders. Then there&#039;s titrating the dose of your medicine, which is arguably just as important.<br /><br />I&#039;m not in the psychiatric field, mind you, but clinical psychology classes were pretty much all I was doing last semester so the information is fresh in my head. I know that makes me about as qualified to diagnose or suggest medication as a homeless person, but I know a little bit about the field, and especially about drug pharmacology (mainly based around bipolar meds and pretty much all recreational drugs, obviously )&nbsp; since that&#039;s what I want to go into on a professional level after I finish all my schooling.<br /><br />You do make a good point though. Benzos are something you gotta commit to, just like SSRI&#039;s, for the most part. But that&#039;s usually the nature of the beast when it comes to either a anxiety disorder or depressive disorder. You&#039;re gonna have to stick with something, usually.
