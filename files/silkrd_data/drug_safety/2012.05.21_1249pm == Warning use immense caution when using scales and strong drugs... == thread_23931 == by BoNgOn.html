				I can confirm 40mg of 2c-p up the nose doesn&#039;t result in death, at least with me. Even though I relived my entire life and death itself lol....<br />Goddamn I never learnt my lesson after doing 6mg of 25i up the nose.<br /><br />I&#039;m always used to doing larger doses like K so it completely slipped my mind but I hope I learn my leson before I kill myself lol&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br />So I just wanted people to know so you might think twice and save yourself from a possible overdose, Always think carefully about chemicals that require minute doses. I have little experience with powders and hopefully now will treat them with the respect they deserve.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand I started tripping in 5-10mins puked for about 10, came up fucking hard for 2 hours, peaked for 7 hours and slowly came down over the next 28 hours finally sleeping 20 hours later after a party.&nbsp; 8)

				Good warning. In the old days it was all grams, half grams and so on on. Now we have some drugs highly potent at 1mg. I&#039;ve read reports on DOC and is that 1mg or 2mg? I would not even trust the cheap import scales on such a measurement unless they were calibrated and you happen to have 1mg weights.<br /><br />Thankfully I mainly do hash and weed. And occasionally some coke and mdma. I&#039;d say my scales have a 10mg - 20mg accuracy which is not good enough for some drugs.<br /><br />Most cheap scales will still have calibration.<br /><br />The old trusted costly jewelers scales everyone could only measure by 100mg increments. The old scales cost over £100 now you can get scales for £15 that measure with 1mg accuracy but would you trust a Chinese made pair of scales that cost a dollar to make with your life?<br /><br />Good post.<br /><br />Good reminder.<br /><br />PS with scales so cheap it means most dealers have to actually offer good weight as everyone now has scales! ;D

				Yeah I&#039;m a fucking tosser, thought I was weighing up 4mg not 40mg. I was going for a really small dose to figure it out so I can dose others properly at the party later. I only snorted it so that it wouldn&#039;t last long, but I don&#039;t recommend snorting this substance it hurts like nothing else maybe a smaller dose would be fine though. <br /><br />And yeah I bought the scales after I had accidentally done 6mg of 25i, Didn&#039;t think I could be that stupid again lol.... ::)

				The issue of scale acuracy always scares me to death.<br />For the moment, that&#039;s OK, cause I just use a mg scale for molly only, so in fact I don&#039;t take any risk at all, molly&#039;s marge of errors being quite large.<br />But in the following months, I would like to try 2C-B, and it really makes me insecure to completely let the scale handle the whole safety issue (weighing) for me.<br /><br />Of course, I also bought weights to calibrate it, and I have mg weights (down to 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10 mg, and even 1 mg, but I&#039;m not sure I can be confident for that last one, cause it seems tore, anyway my scale doesn&#039;t detect it).<br /><br />But accuracy of the scale is definitely a huge safety issue.<br />That could definitely be the kind of issue that I&#039;m afraid could induce a beginning of bad trip if the trip is going in the bad direction, with lots of questions coming to the mind: &quot;was the weighing acurate? Shit, I forgot to calibrate the scale...&quot;

				I sold a few scales on here when I first started vending but I stopped selling them because they are all crap, any scale under $100 is a big stinking pile of poo.<br /><br />

				You can buy bulk (like 100) cheap Chinese made scales for less than a fiver each!<br /><br />I was told this by a retailer.<br /><br />These scales are fine for MDMA which has a relatively big margin of error. 10mg more or less will not matter. They are fine for coke, speed, hash and bud. <br /><br />People buy RCs from China and sell them online on the clear net and in real life in head shops.<br /><br />Some of these RCs are active at 1mg or less! <br /><br />I can see a few deaths caused by these RCs mainly because you can buy a gram of stuff that, if someone snorted a line of 50mg, they would likely be sectioned after the&nbsp; hospital stay. That&#039;s if they lived!<br /><br />Also, blotters used to be mainly LSD. These days anyone can buy seriously powerful hallucinogenics and create blotters. This method might be better than scales but all it needs is for some oversight and you could have some serious difference between blotters. These days, 1mg extra might well mean &#039;serious difference&#039;. <br /><br />With hash, the &#039;overdose&#039; just means crawling to bed - I think eating 5 grams or more of good quality hash beats all this messing 1 mg amounts of substances that may be the next Thalidomide. <br /><br />I used LSD which is measured in thousandths of a gram - 1 gram of pure LSD = 1000 MCG, usually 100 MCG would be the limit so I am told. You would give that to someone who had not used. Imagine trying to weight out 1000th of a gram?<br /><br />Someone must have found a vial of pure LSD in a white crystal powder. A line of that at 50 mg and you just took 50000 MCG.- enough for a few hundred people!<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />If you survived that trip you would have an interesting story. Or a nightmare actually.

				Here is a guide to weighing small amounts properly - <br /><br />Get scales out, set them up, plug them in blah blah. <br /><br />Take the pan off<br /><br />Turn scales on<br /><br />Return pan to scale and make note of the weight of the scale<br /><br />DO NOT TARE WEIGHT OF SCALE<br /><br />Weigh drug on top off the weight of the scale working out the numbers with a pen and paper. <br /><br />That&#039;s the safest way to do it.
