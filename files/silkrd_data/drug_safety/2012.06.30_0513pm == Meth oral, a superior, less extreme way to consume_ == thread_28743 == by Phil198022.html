				Received some meth in the mail. I have infrequently consumed meth since around 2008 with some longer breaks in between. My opinion is this is a very powerful drug which one has to approach with a considerable amount of respect, it&#039;s very easy to overdose and prolongued uninterrupted usage will probably result at least in temporary serious psychological issues, like paranoia, personality changes etc., on the other hand one can have amazing experiences with the drug, a feeling of speed, confidence, being there, excitement etc., it&#039;s a thin rope. Still, not everybody who takes the drug lives in a trailer park, I have held a steady job for years now, you just have to very carefully separate drugs from work.<br /><br />But to get to my question: In the past I mostly consumed the stuff vaporized, either on foil or in a glass pipe, which worked, but was a long and weary process, sitting with your pipe or foil, basically for hours on end, and you have to have a more or less windless room to yourself, without the chance of being disturbed. If somebody sees you with an ice pipe it looks very bad, might ruin your career if you have a job etc. Then there&#039;s the rather unappetizing business of smoking half-burned residue from dirty pipes, which has a pretty awful flavour and appears highly toxic. I have also tried insufflation after grinding it very fine, which does work, just not very well and it hurts in the nose and generally seems to be a big waste of the drug, with a lot of it stuck in snot in the nose for days afterwards, yuck.<br /><br />Today I tried taking it orally like pills for the first time and I must say that by now I am absolutely positively surprised. You get a relatively mellow, steady, long-time hi, without the extreme upper feeling (sometimes accompanied by panic attacks if you accidentally overdose) you get from inhaling. I have been taking the stuff for approximately 8 hours now, maybe every half hour just a crystal the size of a sand corn, and I feel talkative, stimulated, slightly euphoric, listening to music is nice, chatting is nice, really pleasant, it feels like it&#039;s a much less extreme experience than you can get from vaporizing it, which with a rather extreme drug like this is actually a very pleasant change.<br /><br />Some other advantages I can think of:<br /><br />- No need for drug paraphernilia, like a pipe<br />- No need to be alone, like you could be at a friends house who has nothing to do with drugs, or at a party, go to the bathroom, pop a small crystal a bit like one might pop an ecstacy pill, with comparatively minimal danger of anybody noticing what you&#039;re doing, even if somebody enters the room you&#039;re just in. Try that with a pipe<br />- no running nose, which is unpleasant and a give-away like with insufflation. Being discovered in the act insufflating anything is immediately associated with illegal drugs, swallowing something isn&#039;t to the same degree<br />- No lung damage through the toxins, don&#039;t know about damage of the gastrointestinal tract though<br /><br />All in all, it appears like a superior method to take the drug, the only disadvantage I see is that you may need more of it for the same effect, similar to opiates, don&#039;t know the facts on that. Like I have already consumed roughly 200 mg in these 8 hours and I&#039;m nicely hi, chatty as one can read, but not about to kick in a wall or anything, and these 200 mg appear like a large amount to me, since I don&#039;t have a strong tolerance for the drug (I take it maybe once or twice a month).<br /><br />Any opinions / experiences?<br /><br />On a side note: I read meth was widely distributed to German troops in WW2 exactly as pills (Pervitin) and it seemed to work well as a stimulant with that route of consumption, so this is not really some novel or unusual way of consuming the drug, at least historically.

				I remember a History Channel special regarding Hitler&#039;s meth habit. Apparently, Hitler&#039;s doctor would give him daily oral meth pills as &quot;vitamins&quot; daily. Pretty soon he had tolerance via the oral ROA and the doctor had to resort to IV meth for the same effect.<br /><br />Be safe,<br /><br />weedsaves

I actually tried swallowing that already and would not recommend it, stomach cramps for 1-2 weeks, don&#039;t know what toxic adulterants were added. Anyway, now 2 days on I must say taking the meth orally has produced no negative side effects, no stomach cramps, no nausea or whatever and the effect is quite similar to smoking vaporized meth, just without the initial rush, which I never enjoyed particularly anyway, you know when you basically can&#039;t sit still and want to destroy something, or feel nervous, suffer from panic in case of an overdose etc.<br /><br />Instead you have a kind of increased self confidence that comes on slowly, talking flash and well-being for hours on end. I think I won&#039;t try other methods of consumption anymore in the future. And you don&#039;t have all the hassle with the foil/pipes that are probably toxic, take a lot of time and are legal evidence.<br /><br />Maybe if regular 100% medical grade amphetamine is available on SR again I&#039;ll try to get a comparison, but I assume meth is stronger and lasts longer. And really high grade regular Amphetamine isn&#039;t cheap either, it was on offer here for over 20 btc a gram, hardly cheaper than meth, probably from some pharmaceutical companies in russia or china i guess.

				This is intriguing. I have some product on the way, and I&#039;m looking to be as aware of the dangers of this particular beast as possible, and to stay vigilant in my resect.<br /><br />I&#039;m of the opinion smoking is indeed more habit forming. I&#039;m not so fond of how you have to take extra precautions with your mouth, and of the explicity of paraphernalia. I AM however concerned that some people reported having stomach troubles with this ROA. Unfortunately, I suffer from IBS and an ulcer. I try my best not to rock the boat too badily, so I&#039;m glad to see you had not problem with this. Perhaps some more research is necessary into this possible new ROA for meth.&nbsp;

				Well meth definitely will kick your IBS up a notch.<br />Stress on your system depends how hard you hit it though.<br />If you can do 75mgs and put it down for the night and sleep at leastb 5 hours your will lessen stress and improve the rebuilding of spent dopamine.<br />:)<br />nomad

				Oh, for sure. I&#039;m that rare one with some sense. Sometimes.<br /><br />I totally expect an irritated stomach, happens all the time with MDMA/Ecstasy. More often thn not, 20 minutes in I&#039;m either doing #2 or puking. I am seriously considering plugging as I&#039;ve heard alot of good things on this ROA with this drug. And I&#039;ve been around a bit. I&#039;ve got a dozen years of mostly responsible ecstasy (+) use. <br /><br />Now meth, I did maybe 3 times 10 years ago. Now, I&#039;m just splitting a half between a friend in a few weeks.&nbsp; We won&#039;t necessarily do the whole half. I&#039;m just wondering if it would be more rough on my guts than an oral dose of mdma/ecstasy, but then again, the amount of pills I&#039;ve put away over the last 12 years, I&#039;ve already orally ingested a lot of methamphetamine. So maybe I&#039;m over-thinking this. I think I just like the idea of smoking, has some weird appeal to me even with its cons.

				I&#039;ve never smoked or shot Meth, though I plan to in the next coupla months. I found eating it produced similar effects to adderall, albeit stronger (obviously). Running at 100%, a bit talkative, a bit more eccentric than usual, and that&#039;s about it. Sniffing it produced the same effects, though quicker. I&#039;ve read shooting and smoking it produce more of a high/feeling of invincibility, so I&#039;m curious to see the differences.

				For those who have taken meth orally, do you put it in a capsule or not? Also, what is the starter dosage? Are you measuring it with a milligram scale or just eyeing it? I like speed for selected projects but don&#039;t like to smoke it and am not interested in IV. the pharm stimulant prices on here are so crazy it looks like some good pure meth would be cheaper than adderall.

				oral is a much preferred method. the comedown is almost pleasant. <br /><br />and addiction can be almost eliminated provided your personality is not too much a ocd person.<br /><br />70-90mg is a good dose.<br /><br />i have high tolerance to stimulants...i was able to have that and enjoy it without it being too overwhelming, however my heart was ripping over 100bpm well over 11hours. so take it EARLY in the day if you want to get sleep. otherwise do it whenever if your planning on doing an all nighter or something.<br /><br />sniffing alot and smoking alot really goes hard on your mind, with come downs that are harsh and regretful. oral meth is seriously a very advantageous method in that respect alone. but then again, if you can administer it any ways with out &#039;red lining&#039; your mind and body too much i guess its ok..but again, oral is a great cushion all around.

				ive done both...and just taken a shard and dropped it in water (looks cool as you see it slowly ooze into a clear oily substance into the water)<br /><br />all of which had little to no difference in come up/peak/come down<br /><br />if anything drinking it in water has a light bitter taste, putting the shard directly on your tounge even more so...id say it honestly doesnt matter

				I&#039;ve never tried the oral way before just smoked or snorted it, but what i learned the hard way and what i would recommend to everyone who &quot;buy&#039;s the ticket and takes the ride&quot; - Hunter S. Thompson is to have at least 2-3mg of xanax on them and maybe a pill or two of vicodine, when you start coming down and get all those stupid cant get out of your head meth thoughts this method just chills you out and makes the ride alot smoother in my humble opinion. I guess i should be careful recommending mixing drugs through but if your pretty conservative with the xanax and vics i think you&#039;ll find it will help your comedown be much less a pain in the ass.

				When i take oral doses of meth I crush up 25mg and put it in an empty vitamin c capsule. If you aren&#039;t a regular user this will be more than enough to start with and will keep you feeling good for 10-12 hours. If for some reason you don&#039;t feel it after 1 hour you can always take a bit more. I was surprised at how well ingesting meth works since I snort most of the time... now i do a combo of both.<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t preach enough about having Xanax and Vicodin on hand if our fooling around with meth or coke, I&#039;m no doctor and i&#039;m sure someone with a lot more knowledge and evidence on this subject is free to rebuke everything i&#039;ve suggested but I when i came of coke, no matter if its pure or cut, i get so depressed it seriously painful and before i would just make sure i had enough alcohol around to drink myself into a coma, met the problem wasn&#039;t so much the depression as much as never being able to go to sleep and having the schizo meth thoughts that your can&#039;t get out of your head. When i stumbled on the Xanax hydrocodone method it made it so much better, i&#039;m not saying your going t wanna runa a triathlaon when your done but it will help your comedown exponentially.

People who take xanax to calm themselves down while on a coke binge are riding the fine line and if you don&#039;t know what the hell you&#039;re doing you will have a seizure ... and the worst part is you won&#039;t see it coming because of how downers/uppers .. speedballs work. Some people will be so calm after taking a xanax while high that they will continue binging ... if you don&#039;t understand why this is bad then don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />As for taking them while&nbsp; coming down.. FUCK YEAH. Lifesavers. If you drink a lot though don&#039;t take xanax and pain pills because you won&#039;t wake up. Don&#039;t believe me ? Look around at some suicide boards... Most promote the use of xanax and a bottle of alcohol for suicide.<br /><br />Be careful. xanax should be treated like any other serious controlled substance. Ask anyone who has ever od&#039;d on meth - doctor will check to see if you&#039;re not too wired or strung out to determine whether or not your heart can handle the upper/downer combo and if so will give you a benzo of some sort.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				yes there is a medication in the USA called Desoxyn, which is the name brand for methamphetamine aka Crystal meth.<br />its sold here on the road, i believe it usually comes in 5 mg tablets.<br />From what I&#039;ve heard desoxyn is smoother and has less side effects than adderall

				Doesn&#039;t taste anywhere near as bad Piracetam but then again the quantity is significantly less. If you plan to use it semi-regularly to not develop too much tolerance yet harness it&#039;s potential then oral is probably better since chronic snorting (of anything, including cocaine) will damage your nasal septum. Heard smoking it is more addictive but cannot confirm since I never tried it.<br />If you do apply it via nasal insufflation, washing it with acetone first will make it burn less. Upside, like injecting or smoking, is that a lower dosage is needed. To me the downside outweighs it and I&#039;d rather do it sublingual or oral and sacrifice some to first pass effect. Also I prefer the more gentle rise and fall than sudden jump. Slightly faster than oral would also be an enema although I see no reason for it. You still suffer first pass and have to lube up a syringe. From what I gather there are a loyal crowd for that method on ecstasy and cocaine mix.

I like speed for selected projects but don&#039;t like to smoke it and am not interested in IV. the pharm stimulant prices on here are so crazy it looks like some good pure meth would be cheaper than adderall.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just dissolve it in warm water with sugar and lemon juice, tastes good and absorbs quickly. You can use a capsule if you want.&nbsp; I use it rarely, so my dose is usually 30-40 mg, when I tried it for the first time I took about 30 mg. I use very simple 0.01 g scales.

				I do this all the time. Usually with a primer bump first, for a quick kick in the ass, maybe 5mg max. Then ill wrap a shard, usually like any where from 10mg-50mg depending on what i need it for, in a joint paper or toilet tissue.. parachute that bitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;Im not a regular user, but always keep some around, as i very rarely use it for recreation. For the most part, when i need it for all its amazing beneficial properties. <br /><br />&nbsp;Occasionally ill use a gel cap if i dont need it to do its thing asap. Also usually make custom mdma rolls for a few friends, in these ill never put more than 10-12mg, unless some one specifically asks me to make it speedy. Ive seen a 130lb person pretty much chilling and loving it, off of 15mg..and a 220lb person practically tweak the fuck out for 10+ hours off of 6mg. So for the sake of harm reduction i keep the doses light. Every one who takes them falls in love, half of the people having been the first ones to start talking shit when the word &#039;meth&#039; was mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;I agree that this is the superior ROA, for the light meth user. The users that can bang or vape hundreds of mg at a time more likely than not would not agree with this.&nbsp;

I weigh around 75kg/165lbs, is this a sensible dosage?<br />What effects does it add to the standard MDMA roll? does it get rid of the smacked out feeling sometimes associated with higher doses of MDMA? <br />Thanks

				Man youll love it!<br /><br />Add another 10mg mdma to that cap, and you got the perfect dose for your weight. <br /><br />It makes the down swings when &#039;rolling&#039; in and out of that warm mdma eye fluttering, teeth chattering feeling, so much more pleasant. When the mdma isnt peaking, the meth has you in the BEST mind state!<br /><br />Along with there being basically NO crash, just a worn out &quot;i had an amazing night, time for bed&quot; feel, it also keeps you in a social positive mood. No urge to curl up alone and mush. The meth compliments the mdma amazingly. Shoot me a pm and let me know how it goes.
