				Hey all!<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve tried Ketamine, I&#039;m considering &#039;graduating&#039; on to shrooms or cacti (I&#039;m honestly uncertain as to whether or not k was supposed to come before or after them). I&#039;m curious if you&#039;ll think I&#039;m ready for either.<br /><br />MDMA/X Pills, I&#039;ve had many- and OFC I&#039;ve had an amazing time every time. I can handle the hangover, and even did so back when I was suicidally depressed (the hangover from MDMA is more of a heartwarming emptiness than a depression IMO).<br /><br />Marijuana, regardless of overarching strain family, gives me a massive headache. If it&#039;s a Sativa, I&#039;ll think the cops are after me or I&#039;ll fear that I&#039;ll forget what time is and therefore by not keeping track of it I&#039;ll accidentally end the universe which&#039;d make everyone pissed at me. With Indica&#039;s, I just feel like something&#039;s wrong/off and eat too much.<br /><br />LSD- I love, love, LOVE it! Best substance that I&#039;ve tried, best substance that exists. I&#039;ve tripped many times and never had a bad trip. The first time I tripped was after years of suicidal depression, though on the day of my first trip I forced myself to feel happy while sober to ensure I&#039;d have a good trip when I took the acid, and I did! I&#039;ve also candyflipped, though it was a bit too intense for me and the MDMA hangover combined with the acid was the closest to a bad trip I&#039;ve ever had.<br /><br />DMT is scary. Everytime I&#039;ve attempted to smoke it has hurt like hell, and I feel like I&#039;m being warned by some alien being that I&#039;m about to dabble into secrets I&#039;m not allowed to dabble into. I&#039;ve sandwiched it, made a lab tube vape... it always hurts and always scares the shit out of me. I&#039;ve never been able to properly blast off, probably because I&#039;m too scared to properly smoke and hold it.<br /><br />Ketamine is bizarre and I&#039;m currently coming off it and about to do another line- maybe the 10th, 20th of the day, I have no fucking clue, but for some reason I can&#039;t stop. I want to use this gram up asap and move onto something else for the time being. Last night I took 75 mg oral, didn&#039;t really feel much so I snorted 50 mg, waited 5 minutes and snorted 50 more mg- almost instantly I completely forgot what reality was and was amazed that I had hands that I could control. I also learned how to dance to dubstep as it gave me the wobblies. I soon realized that I was a spaceship, but quickly discovered I was actually the earth but really a singularity with the entire universe. I had no hallucinations, I just felt like I was in a completely different domain from my surroundings and didn&#039;t pay attention to them. All the feelings of k feel incredibly sterile and somewhat malevolent; it feels like if somebody came up to me with a knife and asked to stab me I&#039;d tell them to go ahead and have fun. I have zero clue as to whether or not I like this or not.<br /><br />¬_¬ <br /><br />Anywhoo, do you think I could handle Shrooms or Mescaline? What&#039;s the difference between the two trips, and how do they differ from acid? My main concern is how much I&#039;ve disliked my DMT attempts- I&#039;ve heard that DMT is more like shrooms than acid. Additionally, given my past full of mental health issues, I&#039;m concerned at how LSD is considered the psychedelic where you can choose whereas shrooms are the psychedelic that chooses for you. Thanks for your advice!<br />

				I find shrooms to be an easier trip than LSD. I always find LSD to be somewhat implacable and unforgiving, deeply intellectual and never ending (I don&#039;t think an LSD trip really ends, just keeps dissolving little by little into your everyday consciousness until it&#039;s finally gone). I think shrooms are more fun, without being less profound, and the trip is much shorter and actually ENDS. I love both LSD and shrooms, but I use the first one to have life-changing experiences and I always get out of the trip with a few tips I can actually apply to my life to make it better; and I use shrooms more for pure fun and beauty, drifting and experiencing life in a pretty pure way. I haven&#039;t breakthrough yet on DMT (I plan to do it this afternoon) but for now I don&#039;t find it comparable to shrooms (maybe the visuals, but not the overall feeling).<br /><br />I think you&#039;re more than ready, you just have to take them with all the respect they deserve and let go. I deeply love them, if I had to name one maybe shrooms would be my drug of choice. About mescaline, I&#039;ll try it later this month so I can&#039;t say anything yet.

				Shrooms easier? Wow, haven&#039;t heard that o_0<br /><br />As for trips ending, I know what you mean. Only once have I stayed up long enough to feel like the acid has faded off, and even then I had to nap before I felt like a functional human being. That being said, LSD is still my favorite drug.

				low dose of mushrooms sounds like what you need, visit my vendor page if interested.<br /><br />Also 2 or 300mgs of mescaline could be something you&#039;d enjoy and sounds like would go well for you, but do you&#039;re research and find a reliable source for pure mescaline.<br /><br />With love<br />Psych

For me mushrooms are: self-loathing, over analyzing every shitty thing I&#039;ve ever done, antisocial and confusing. Just concentrated dysphoria every goddamn time. 4-aco-dmt was no different. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I DONE TO MYSELF&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s good mushrooms don&#039;t effect everyone else that way, because I know many drug people, particularly those who never went to college or festivals where every soft drug is readily available, who it&#039;s the only psychedelic they have tried. That could really turn some people off to the idea of tripping, like a guy from kenya trying dominos and deciding he doesn&#039;t like pizza.
