				Hey y&#039;all,<br /><br />So I have about $100 worth of bitcoins left over and have an option of either cashing them back into dollars, or trying a new drug. Could you suggest me one?<br /><br />Here are the things I have tried already: weed, JWH-122, MDMA, 2CI, 2CB, 25I-NBOME, LSD, shrooms, DMT, changa. As you can see, I haven&#039;t tried any addictive &quot;can potentially ruin your life&quot; kind of drugs... I&#039;m pretty scared of turning into habitual meth/heroin user (I don&#039;t have a strong will to stop), so I&#039;ll probably stay away from these types.<br /><br />The kind of drug I&#039;m looking for can serve a purpose of casual / fun / party use, or something more serious for self-reflection and self-discovery. Ideally it can be smoked or ingested.. no IV or snorting :)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				You should try MDA and some of the other 2C&#039;s like 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P<br /><br />Also add some tryptamines to your list, try some AMT, 4-AcO-DMT, and 5-MeO-DiPT

I think the active ingredient in them was 4-AcO-DMT, but I ended up throwing the pills away because after just a month (in original packaging) they showed green-ish stains on them. I guess the vendor doesn&#039;t quite have his pill pressing figured out just yet.

				i second both the mda AND the 4-aco-dmt. both substances that have that magic =) there are some tryptamines that are fun and less spiritual, but i find them sort of pointless. like i could be taking an nbome if i just wanted to trip without investing my mind into a philosophical adventure. mda is tons better than mdma in my opinion. mda is psychedelic, more for the amazing sensations and feeling the love of the universe, than the sensations of mdma that tend to be a bit more speedy and a bit more unnatural.. mda is very stoning as well. reinforces the desire to sit and enjoy the amazing feelings. other than those two, i would say try some amt =D its been labeled as the rolls royce of psychedelics by ken kesey, and leary also advocated the use of it. i havent tried it yet but i know its at the top of my list for SURE. let us know what you try and how it goes, im interested&nbsp; :)

				I just want to mention that raw 4-aco-dmt powder is really difficult to work with.<br /><br />If I were Op I would try to find some exotic benzos like flunitrazepam, or triazolam.<br /><br />But &quot;New Drug&quot;, I think that a Jeffrey might qualify. Assemble a Jeffrey.

				Thanks to everyone for your feedback.<br /><br />So far I have the following list. I&#039;m going to study each drug and see which one has the most potential for me.<br /><br />* 2C-C (2C-C is a psychedelic phenethylamine, with dosage and effects similar, but not identical, to those of 2C-B. Some users report similarities with other psychedelics such as LSD.)<br /><br />* 2C-D (The effects of 2C-D are usually compared to 2C-B or other psychedelic stimulants and sometimes to MDMA (ecstasy). Its effects are generally considered milder than 2C-B, LSD, or MDMA. 2C-D is not known for strong visuals nor is it generally considered as empathic or euphoric as MDMA (ecstasy)).<br /><br />* 2C-E (2C-E is a psychedelic phenethylamine, with dosage and effects similar, but not identical, to those of 2C-B. Some users report similarities with other psychedelics such as LSD.)<br /><br />* 2C-P (Although it shares some qualities with 2C-E and other related phenethylamines, 2C-P appears to have unique and divergent characteristics that some people have found to be intense or challenging, particularly when taken in high doses. Reported effects include out-of-body experiences; confusing, dream-like realities and strong auditory and visual hallucinations.)<br /><br />* 4-AcO-DMT (The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT are usually compared those of psilocybin/psilocin, although it is sometimes described as &quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;more euphoric&quot; than psilocybin-containing mushrooms.)<br /><br />* 5-MeO-DiPT (5-MeO-DiPT is a pschoactive tryptamine... often known by its recently coined name &quot;foxy&quot;.Reactions to 5-MeO-DIPT vary dramatically from those who find it compelling, sexy, exhilerating, interesting, &amp; joyful to those who find it nauseating, irritating, diarrhea-inducing, and generally un-fun.)<br /><br />* AMT (AMT is a psychedelic amphetamine-tryptamine.. Its effects usually last 8-14 hours when swallowed and 3-6 hours when insufflated. Its effects are often characterized as a cross between a psychedelic and an MDMA, with empathogenesis and strong physical stimulation common.)<br /><br />* Ketamine (The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine are generally reported to be pleasant, though if they are unexpectedly intense, they can be distressing. A well-known effect of ketamine at higher-range doses is the &quot;K-hole&quot;, where the user is removed from reality and set adrift in an introspective dream-like world, often involving complete dissociation, immersive visuals and out-of-body experiences)<br /><br />* Exotic benzos like flunitrazepam, or triazolam (Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine used as a sleep medication favored for its rapid onset and long duration. Triazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine used in the treatment of insomnia and anxiety disorders.)<br /><br />* MDA (MDA is a synthetic empathogen sometimes found in ecstasy tablets. It is closely related to MDMA though its effects are said to be slightly more psychedelic.)<br /><br />* MXE (Methoxetamine is a near chemical analog of ketamine and PCP. Its use was first publicly reported in 2010. Methoxetamine&#039;s effects are described by some as similar to ketamine or high-dose DXM, while others report not finding it similar to those substances.)<br /><br />* Opium (Opium is a naturally occurring analgesic harvested as a latex from ripe Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) pods. It has a long history of use by humans as an oral and smoked psychoactive.)<br /><br />*Jeffrey (any combination of the above)

				What sucks is that I have to FE for CharasBros. The guy is shipping all the fuck from India, 3+ weeks estimated delivery, and doesn&#039;t refund or reship. His rating is 94 and reviews are mostly &quot;FE&quot; with a few &quot;awesome vendor&quot;. Member for 9 months with 300+ transactions.<br /><br />Looking at forums, there&#039;s a couple of buyers calling him a rip-off (obviously FE&#039;d and didn&#039;t receive shit) and a couple of guys complaining of how shitty his product is, but not much else.<br /><br />He does have the cheapest opium, and there&#039;s only a couple other vendors selling opium.<br /><br />What do y&#039;all say, should I risk FE or back out?

				lol since my experience with f16 (mdma seller that was said to have been selective scamming) from netherlands, ive been making a conscious effort to order from my own country for sure. nothing wrong with paying a little extra to guarantee you get what you paid for.<br />although i just recently set a rule on my self to only order from out of my country if the seller has a 100 rating. <br /><br />be safe :)
