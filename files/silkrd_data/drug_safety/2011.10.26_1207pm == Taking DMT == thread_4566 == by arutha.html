				I can&#039;t seem to find my last DMT thread... Might have been lost in all the stuff that happened here in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Anyway, I have found a much more efficient way to smoke it using my glass vaporizer. Rather than trying to vaporize it through the glass as I do with weed, I place it on the mesh screen above the bowl, light above it, and suck. The heat (not flame) flows directly over it and it smokes up very quickly and easily. I am still struggling to get a 50mg dose in at once though since the smoke is so harsh..<br /><br />I probably got about 30-35mg the other night judging on how much was left after, everything around me started &#039;swimming&#039; which was pretty cool and colours went all funky. I did see blurry images when I closed my eyes, was a bit scary actually. But I felt very strongly like I was going to faint, which is what stopped me trying to finish the rest. I went into a sweat and felt dizzy, and overall a bit sick. Is this normal before falling into the sleep if the dose is high enough? Or should it be a more relaxed going to sleep? I&#039;m assuming that feeling lasted and I didn&#039;t actually sleep mostly because I couldn&#039;t get the full dose down.

				i ordered an ubie from their official site and haven&#039;t received shit - placed the order over a week ago. kinda bummed because i doubt i&#039;ll be able to have an opportunity to smoke dmt again for months.<br /><br />i had a fun trip with the deemsters last night though. ingested about 1.4g of ghb, parachuted 100mg of dopeboys 50/50 mdma/dea mixture, and then about an hour and half into the experience (starting to come off the peak) i decided to mix about 40mg of elvis&#039;s dmt with a bowl of cannabis.<br /><br />i&#039;d read on the interwebs that some kids were snorting n,n-dmt. Probably one of the stupidest things you could do outside of dropping gbl in your eye (i&#039;ve done it, and it wasn&#039;t on purpose either - that shit sucked). I mean, if you&#039;re into putting something almost as caustic as lye up your snout, be my guest. However, I found a post where some guy had bumped maybe 5mg of material right before he smoked a normal dose and it prolonged his trip into the 20-30 minute range. I decided while not the brightest idea I&#039;m also aware that 5mg of material isn&#039;t enough to do any serious damage.<br /><br />Well FUCKING BLAST OFF because I was quickly propelled into 20 minutes or so of dmt hyperspace - serious closed/open eye visuals, the world became my cartoon and I was awash with some of the most beautiful and cosmic patterns I&#039;ve ever seen. When the world started coming back to me I could feel a sting in the back of my face - I grabbed some warm water and washed it out, seemed to help. The stinging sensation remained there until I went to sleep a few hours later. It&#039;s been about 16 hours since I did this and there is no residual pain whatsoever.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it was the myriad of psychoactive chemicals I decided to imbibe or that little bump - but something happened outside of the normal 5-10minute dmt experience. Seriously though, don&#039;t line up a 50mg line of nn-dmt to send through your nasal cavity, I can only imagine how bad that&#039;d hurt. Having caustic burn lesions in your sinus cavity can&#039;t be fun - at all.

				I did a small bump (re: 5mg) before smoking 40mg and it seemed to extend the trip significantly. However, I was on other substances at the time (most notably, mdma/mdea) so I&#039;m not sure if that had any bearing.<br /><br />5mg hurt, not before or during the trip, but afterwards I could feel sharp stinging in my nasal passage. I can&#039;t imagine what snorting 10x the amount would feel like, and I&#039;ll never know - because I hear it fucking sucks - bad.

				Cool so I made up a &#039;DMT machine&#039; using a wine bottle and some steel wool. I&#039;m a bit suspicious of the steel wool; if a lighter is applied directly to it then it melts. I might need to try to find some thicker stuff, or copper if I can. But it seemed to work in a small trial run, it took a long time heating before I felt like I got anything out of it. I was also a little worried of DMT dripping out through the steel wool and onto my hand. Still could not get enough in one hit to send me to hyperspace though. Damn.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just ordered a glass bong with glass bowl, I will use it primarily for DMT when it comes. I&#039;m thinking pack some mesh or steel wool into it, put the stuff on, draw heat from a lighter through by sucking without the flames touching it. I should be able to cool it with water and hopefully fill the bong to get a big hit at once. Tonight I will put the loaded steel wool I have into my vape and see if I can get a big hit from that.<br /><br />To be honest, my lungs have been a bit fucked for a while with pneumonia and such so I should also maybe try to strengthen them before trying to hold a big hit of DMT again. I&#039;m not really keen on the idea of snorting it.

If you tilt the bottle upwards slightly you won&#039;t have to worry about your hand.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had pretty good success with putting it on top of a mostly cashed bowl and being careful with the flame. I&#039;m used to not torching my weed anyways so that&#039;s pretty easy. The ubie works great when I have to worry about odor - it&#039;s difficult to smoke with at first though.

				I&#039;ve heard from a lot of places you can sprinkle it over some weed and hold the flame a few inches away and melt it over the bowl. Just not sure if you&#039;re inhaling vapors when you melt it or if you just smoke the bowl after you melt your crystals.

Assuming you keep the flame off of it and it just vaporizes instead of turning to smoke, would that make it invisible? Thus I should be drawing after a minute or so regardless of whether I see anything in it or not?<br /><br />@jackstraw, the main different types of DMT (there is also DXT and a couple of different but similar products) are freebase and fumarate. The fumarate is I believe in a salt form and cannot be smoked, this is the one you eat. To get it to work, you need an MAOI as well or your stomach enzymes stop it, like that the effects last a lot longer, the dose is higher, and I believe its not quite as intense. The freebase is the one to smoke or vape.<br />I used the seller elvis successfully, but everyone seems to say walter is the best.

				Im not exactly sure, but the reason people will salt their DMT(or turn it into fumarate) is because you can store it for extended periods of time(yes I read that somewhere :P)<br />Ive had DMT that was sitting around for about 2 mounths and went to smoke, nothing happened, I thought at the time that I had burned out all my brains DMT receptors but figured it out later why it wasnt working<br /><br />funny funny<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4566.msg40161#msg40161">Quote from: Aliahad on October 30, 2011, 05:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4566.msg40114#msg40114">Quote from: biscuit on October 30, 2011, 12:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">elvis, here .

				Ordered multiple times from Elvis with great results. He ships quick and the product is great.<br /><br />My favorite way to partake is also The Ubie. Load up ~100mg and have a great time. Once I forget how to smoke and can barely recognize what the ubie is, I lay back and let it take over. 50-70mg gives me the rollercoaster of colors, patterns, symbols, and a glimpse of what&#039;s beyond. 75-100mg seems to be my sweet spot for a true breakthrough.<br /><br />Comparing Elvis&#039; latest batch, extra white and sugary, to what walter has I would have to say that they are very similar as far as purity/potency goes. Although it&#039;s quite subjective. Anyways, I&#039;ll be sticking with Elvis since he is domestic and the product won&#039;t be sitting in the mail system for ~2 weeks.

				Biscuit and Aliahad, one of the major reasons that DMT loses its magic and potency is due to an oxidation reaction of the nitrogen with oxygen to form DMT-n-oxide. This can be minimized by storage in an airtight container (preferably vacuum sealed), and also in a dry, dark and cold place. <br /><br />If you are chem savvy, the DMT-n-oxide can be reduced back to DMT in a quick and easy procedure using excess elemental zinc dust in a solution of HCl. Then you basify and re-extract in the non-polar solvent. The method can be found at dmt-nexus. This is also recommended as an initial step with the acidification during an extraction to increase yields, especially if using leaf product or material that has been sitting around for a while.
