				I know there are many posts but i wanted a genuine topic that has views from both sides.<br /><br />For starters i bought 100x2mg Rivotril (clonazepam) from StevePharma.<br /><br />I have popped 5 pills equivalent to 10mg of clonazepam.&nbsp; Now i do feel loopy and chill but nothing like i would if i ate<br /><br />5x2mg Xanax Bars.&nbsp; I mean that should would know me the fuck out.<br /><br />2 questions, first does the Roche company follow a high standard like USA companies do when creating componds.&nbsp; And if so, is this just the feeling imma get for the next 10-18 hours from k pins?<br /><br />Cuz quite frankly, xanax is WAY better.

				I&#039;m not trying to do any vendor bashing but what country did the clonazepam come from? because Roche clonazepam is heavily counterfeited. 10 mg of legit clonazepam would cause me to black out for about two days. <br /><br />(cough India/Pakistan)

				You can send them off for analysis to dancesafe.org for about $40 in the US. I stopped stocking Indian and Paki meds for a reason. There&#039;s just too many bunk pills out there. <br /><br />I&#039;m afraid from what you described your pills are very likely bunk and possibly made of talcum powder and orphan tears. I recommend sending one off for analysis and confronting the vendor if you have the money. 10 mg of clonazepam is equivalent to 10 mg of alprazolam, so you should have gotten rather folded off 5 pills.

				I&#039;d agree on that. Unless you have extreme tolerance to benzo&#039;s, a dose of 10 mg of either alprazolam or clonazepam should severely affect you, probably to the point of passing out. <br /><br />Clonazepam is generally as potent as alprazolam, but the effects last quite a bit longer. If you are knocked out until morning from 10 mg of xanax, you should probably expect to be knocked out until afternoon taking the same amount of clonazepam. Not that i&#039;d recommend doing either :D<br />

				just going off the assumption we are talking about two legit pills of each respective substance in equivalent doses, I would prefer alpraz. Kpins are more of a downer type of high, where as xans seems somewhat energetic for me personally at least if taken in moderate doses.

				Yeah K-Pins should have lit your ass up, to do a little test, maybe take a drink/shot of alochol and they should affect you multiplied by a few X..or smoke a bowl. I remember taking a couple 2mg kpins and the chick I had over said I was sleeping with my eyes open...only time thats ever happend. Then of course I woke up and had sex with her in front of her friend. Cuz I was high and relaxed as a MF!! :)<br /><br />Yeah Kpins knock you out, but if done moderately its relieves me of all anxiety from whatever may cause it. I can think clearly, Xannax on the other hand, 1mg fucks me up nicely but as you said Tony, I am more up.

				Yeah so no bs, i took 2-3 2mg clonazepams.&nbsp; They where mare in Pakistan ad are still in the blister packs.&nbsp; I did feel loopy but no where close to Xanax.<br /><br />My xanax use consists of dosing 2-3 2mg bars at once.... as i like to feeeeeeeel it... lol do i just gave a high tolerance, or did i get bunkafied.

				They are different substances ofcourse. <br /><br />Personally i find that the onset of xanax is more sudden: take one and about half an hour later suddenly notice the effects, even on things like muscle tension in your legs. For me the onset of clonazepam seems slower, even when using the flavored kind that &#039;melts in your mouth&#039;.<br /><br />This does not mean that clonazepam is less potent though, if you wait to see the effect after 2 hours or so clonazepam is somewhat stronger per mg as an hypnotic. As an anxiolytic i&#039;d say it doest matter all that much, although clonazepam has a tendency to stop you from doing what you needed an anxiolytic for in the first place ;)

				Yeah, klonopin is not a very fun drug IMO. Xanax can be very enjoyable for me at smaller dosages. Clonazepam makes me feel silly and drunk. Go GABA agonism!

				Some people say that Xanax has anti-depressant qualities, for a benzo. I probably find lorazepam more effective in this regard though. <br />I&#039;d say that clonazepam beats valium, in terms of long acting benzos. More euphoric, less depressing. Comparing it to Xanax is hard though because they&#039;re different types of benzo.
