				Hi all<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever smoked Heroin off of foil, inhaling through a some rolled up paper - it goes alright...<br /><br />Is there any reason you couldn&#039;t smoke heroin through a glass crack pipe? <br /><br />I would think the glass pipe method would decrease wastage...<br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with smoking smack through a glass pipe?<br /><br />Or can anyone point out reasons why this method would / would NOT be viable<br /><br />cheers,<br />$26

				Never done it or seen it done, but i cant see any reason why not,<br />I take it, but if was going to have to smoke it I&#039;d prefer to look for apipe, <br />than fuk around with chasing the melting blob down the foil, trying not to miss any smoke.<br />but I&#039;ve seen veteran smokers use foil and make it look easier than pulling a bong mate.<br />

				cheers mate, yeah i go ok smoking off of foil on my own, not too much wastage, but certainly not a professional.<br /><br />i guess i&#039;m also worried about oxidising that aluminium foil and inhaling the results.<br /><br />but also worried that maybe the gear will just ignite once the heat builds inside the pipe - that it may not act the way ice does in a pipe.<br /><br />maybe i&#039;ll grab a pipe in the week and run a few tests<br /><br />ta

This forum can always use more edification on drug techniques. I haven&#039;t tried the foil method as of yet but I believe some people preheat the foil to avoid the oxidation you are worried about. <br /><br />One of my buddies smokes BTH out of a regular glass pipe. He puts it on a bottom screen and puts like two or three screens on top of it. I tried it once but I don&#039;t have enough experience to say if it was effective (never looked inside his set up, didn&#039;t see how much was in there before/after anybody hit). <br /><br />Cheers!

				Maybe #3 base. Tar, no freaking way, would just ooze through the brillo and you will destroy alkaloids with direct flame.<br /><br />Pretty much only do it if you want to waste LOTS of your heroin, as it has a low melting point and direct flame will just toast it hard core.<br /><br />I smoke BTH daily, so trust me when I say foil is your best bet.

				yeah there&#039;s really only a few drugs you actually want to put a direct flame to, and even then most of the time&nbsp; vaporization is still a more effecient route to do it. though i&#039;ve never heard of anyone vaping crack&nbsp; :o<br /><br />at any rate, i&#039;m sure putting it in a stem might have some sort of effect, but as others have said it is a rather wasteful way to consume it. it makes some people squeamish but rectal isn&#039;t a bad RoA for opiods... if you&#039;re into that
