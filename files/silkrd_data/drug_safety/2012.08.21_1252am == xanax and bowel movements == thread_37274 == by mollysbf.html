			<dd class="postbody">
				was wondering if anyone else has this reaction to xanax (alprozolam) powder. I bought some from one of the two vendors here on SR, the smaller one. I diluted it and heated it properly for 1mg per 1ml dosage orally via measured dropper. It seems like 5-20 minutes right after I take any kind of amount (1mg-5mg) I end up in the bathroom, sorry if TMI, having small loose stools/shits. I often have this reaction to cocaine but I always though it was the cut that made me shit. Was wondering if anyone has had that reaction to either xanax or the powder form or shitty midwest coke. Am I just different or is this xanax powder cut with something?

				the laxative that is often used to cut drugs, mannitol, is effective as an oral laxative in doses of about 25 grams (1 oz). So it&#039;s not that.

				I have heard baby lactose is used to cut coke and idk what the effective dosage of that is but I feel like it could be in this. should I pursue the vendor and ask for partial refund? He claims he knows the guy and had it tested and it&#039;s 99%. I don&#039;t mind this side affect that much but I feel like this powder is also losing potency, or at least the solution is and idk if that&#039;s because of the cut in it or my fault. I have a certain disorder that gives me weird reactions to some things but I don&#039;t think this is one of them

				fiber powder? that does not help with anxiety lol. I don&#039;t always have diarrhea lol. just wondering if people can give me their advice on how I can deal with this vendor or SR. I have taken xanax pills with prescription for years but just moved and my new psych won&#039;t give benzos so I bought this. the pills have never once given me this affect.

I can take 1mg then 20 minutes later in the bathroom. while not eating in between take a mg 6 hours later and still be in the bathroom again. I know I have met plenty of people that have to take tiny shits right after doing the shitty coke where I used to live in the midwest.

				I was pretty bad off on benzos (takeing 8mg a day script + w/e else I could get) and I can say that out of all the problems benzo abused caused me, problems with bowl moments were not on the list. now if you&#039;re stacking them with opiates, that&#039;s a different story.

Stimulants stimulate the bowel movement. Very common amoung stimulants. Even coffee gives you the shits.

				I&#039;ve never had bowel problems with any benzos luckily.&nbsp; I have the &#039;smaller&#039; powdered alprazolam vendor&#039;s product and it&#039;s never given me any troubles of any kind luckily.<br /><br />Now opiates on the other hand, must have lactulose on hand !
