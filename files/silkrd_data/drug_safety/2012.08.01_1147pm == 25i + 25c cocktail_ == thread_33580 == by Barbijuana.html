				I&#039;ve had experience with I and B together, not intranasally, and it was a very nice experience. I would suggest taking half of what you would normally do with one of them with each of them.<br />One up each nose!<br /><br />The I should bring out some beautiful visuals, and the C will of course enhance this and bring it&#039;s own beauty and intrigue to the trip. Just be careful.<br /><br />PS - IMO these substances are very forgiving if used safely. I&#039;ve IV&#039;d 25(either C or I) back in my more reckless days, and it was one of the most beautiful, yet intense experiences of my life.<br /><br />So TLDR I think the experience will be beautiful and epic, and I would give it a shot at a 1:1 ratio

				I&#039;m gonna try this tomorrow. I&#039;m thinking 600ug of 25c-NBOMe and 550ug of 25i-NBOMe. Maybe I should lower the 25c a little bit but I&#039;m not sure... what do you guys think?

				Good luck! Report back =D<br /><br />I don&#039;t wanna throw this thread off topic, but are the nobmes when on tabs generally tasteless for you guys? Except from the little bit of numbing. Because the ones I&#039;ve had have been pretty tasteless. Thanks!

				I was taking 2mg of HardHustles 25i on blotters and was definitely getting a numbing/metallic taste and feeling in my mouth. The onset was slightly nauseous but after that initial hump it rocked my socks off.

				it&#039;s definitely one of my favorite experiences when taking one then the other an hour later or snorting some powder after having a couple of blotters in for an hour or 2. Yea I always taste the blotters but don&#039;t know how to describe the taste. It&#039;s not really metallic to me. It&#039;s more like a bittery medicinal flavor with very little numbing. Yea the one compliments the other very nice regardless of which one you do first

				I just took ~400ug of 25i and ~300ug of 25c complexed. It shouldn&#039;t be too intense, but I kept it low in case there&#039;s synergy. I&#039;ll be smoking weed throughout.

				Do a trip report for us afterward! It&#039;s always great to have some kind of record of the effects when not much is known about the drugs, especially in combination. It could really be beneficial to others.

				It was extremely underwhelming, but please note I probably had tolerance. I did lay down and listen to Dark Side of the Moon and had some basic revelations about my life, which is the only reason I wanted to trip. But I didn&#039;t go very deep whatsoever and I could BARELY and I mean BARELY see any visuals. This dosage was just too low. It did feel different though, but it&#039;s very hard to explain with low doses.<br /><br />So all in all, it was a bit introspective and empathic but I could have easily had a conversation with someone with my parents or something. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I will repeat this experiment. I&#039;m not comfortable mixing high doses of these two substances. Each one is a pretty huge mindfuck by itself, and combined I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be too confused to function properly and then send me into a panic attack.
