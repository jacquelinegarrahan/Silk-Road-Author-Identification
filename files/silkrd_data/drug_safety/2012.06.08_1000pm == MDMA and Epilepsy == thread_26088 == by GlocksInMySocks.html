				A buddy of mine has Epilepsy he&#039;s parties pretty hard. Lately has been hitting me up for some Beans. I&#039;m very reluctant to give him any because I know how serious of a disorder Epilepsy I&#039;m weary he will take a bean and have a Seizure. IF anyone can shed some light on this I would appreciate it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks

				I see your concern, and epilepsy is a serious illness, however when someone has an epileptic fit it isn&#039;t usually serious and they can get up and be fine afterwards, not even realizing it&#039;s happened. How bad is his epilepsy?<br /><br />From a medical perspective MDMA could bring on a fit, it does cause swelling of the brain...

				Seizures don&#039;t scare me, I have had them and been around people when they are having them.&nbsp; But for people who have never seen someone have a seizure it can scare the shit out of them. His Epilepsy I guess is moderate I know he can&#039;t have a drivers license.

				Everyone has a &quot;seizure threshold&quot;. A person with epilepsy has a seizure threshold that is lower than that of a normal person&#039;s. Drugs like MDMA lower this threshold even more and can greatly increase the risk of seizure. I would not want to be the one to supply your friend with MDMA simply due to the risk of physical injury from having a seizure.<br /><br />If you decide to supply him I would only give him a half dose but I still think it is a bad idea.
