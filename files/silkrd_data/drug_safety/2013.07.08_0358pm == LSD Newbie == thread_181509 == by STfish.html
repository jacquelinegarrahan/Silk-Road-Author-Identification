				Ok, so I&#039;m not interested in taking the LSD myself, I&#039;d rather sell it to peers, I can&#039;t take LSD due to my line of work, I have to be conscious of my surroundings at all times.<br /><br />So my first question arises with blotter paper, if I were to buy it, how long would the paper stay fresh, meaning does the LSD evaporate out of the paper? I want to sell it at raves so I would have to wait until the date of the event to sell it.<br /><br />Second, what is the standard LSD price on the streets? I&#039;ve heard 10 dollars for a hit but i&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />Third, why don&#039;t more vendors sell in vials or liquid form?

Store it in a cool dry place wrapped in tinfoil and be as gentle as you can with it!<br /><br />Where I come from the street price is 10 euro a hit.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure why vendor don&#039;t stock as much liquid LSD.<br />I say it&#039;s because people would trust blotters more, there also easier to resell and liquid is harder to accurately gauge dosage but thats just off the top of my head.
