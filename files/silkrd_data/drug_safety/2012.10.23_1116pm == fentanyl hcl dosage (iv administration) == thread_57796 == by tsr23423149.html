				I am trying to understand a discrepancy in the information disseminated by various internet sources. I am aware that the sources include forum postings and Wikipedia, and that these sources are not definitive sources of information. However, I am still confused.<br /><br />Wikipedia as well as several forum posts here suggest that 100 micrograms (mcg) of fentanyl is a high dosage for opiate naive people. Furthermore, one of the items on SR is a listing for 100 milligrams (mg) for BTC 50, or approximately USD 600. This comes to USD 0.6 per &quot;high&quot; dose. Now, several sources of information, Wikipedia included, list the potency of fentanyl as 100 times that of heroin. I take this to mean that you can use 1/100th of the weight of heroin for similar effects from fentanyl. <br /><br />I have used heroin many times, and I believe stamp bags are supposed to be 100mg. I have received bags which vary wildly in weight even in the same batch. Even empty bags sometimes. So let&#039;s say that these bags are 50mg each. I assume that each of these would be equivalent to 500mcg of fentanyl. This makes no sense as that should be an enormous dosage of fentanyl by other reports. Assuming this was true, then a 500mcg dose of fentanyl would be worth USD 3 per dose. But this would be a small dose. At my peak opiate tolerance I injected 20 bags of heroin in one 0.9 mL shot. This would be the equivalent of 10mg of fentanyl if the 500mcg dose is correct as a one bag dose. It would be 2mg if the 100mcg dose was to be believed. However, if the 100mcg dose is correct then the pricing seems to be exceptionally attractive. <br /><br />What am I missing here? How do I dose correctly? I am wondering if the 100x potency figure is correct, if the price is exceptionally attractive, and/or if the correct one bag equivalent dose is 100mcg. Any mistakes could be fatal, so I hope that whoever answers this question has intimate experience with the chemical in question. A certain other fentanyl listing mentioned 100mcg to 1000mcg (1mg) diluted in 1mL for IV administration. This seems to indicate 100mcg is like one bag, 1000mcg is like 10 bags, and you can choose to inject anywhere in-between. This is again indicative of 1000x potency. I also saw numerous references to carfentanil being listed as both 100x potency compared to fentanyl and 10000x compared to heroin. This seems to back up the 100x figure. Can anyone shed some light on this subject, please?

				Even given the fact that fentanyl is extremely potent I have oubts 100x times more potent heroin.<br /><br />100X times more potent than street heroin of good quality this I think can be correct. Probably that is the cas because 100% heroin is impossible to find.<br />I have a listing myself for 2.5 ml 2.5mg. That is equivalent to 0.25 g of high grade heroin if you are correct.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am actually quite disappointed with the lack of replies here. In any case, here&#039;s what I&#039;d have to say to you, Procain: if you use 2.5 mg (2500 mcg) and consider that to be 250mg (100x potency) of street heroin or pure heroin, then that&#039;s 2.5 x 100mg heroin bags. That is, we equate 2500mcg of fentanyl to 2.5 bags of pure heroin. Let&#039;s say that&#039;s 5 bags of street heroin. And since bags are sometimes half full, that&#039;s 10 bags. A 10 bag shot is not an overdose to most heavy addicts. However, most fentanyl literature and patch listings and whatever will tell you that a 100mcg patch is for serious, heavy users only. Let&#039;s say, then that a 25mcg patch is for decent tolerance. That means that with 2.5mg (2500 mcg) you are basically taking 100x the dosage a patch gives. Patches give off their dose in hourly increments, so a 72 hour 25mcg patch has 3/4 of the 2.5mg (2500mcg) you are listing. All of this doesn&#039;t really add up because that means that the hourly 25mcg patch delivers 1/100 of 10 bags of heroin, or a tenth of a bag of heroin. I have a feeling that a pain patient with pain serious enough to take fentanyl will not be using a tenth of a bag of heroin an hour to manage pain. To the serious user, a bag of heroin per hour is not the same. This is all really confusing. What&#039;s confusing me even more is that your listing is in 2.5mL of solvent. With the standard 1mL syringe, I assume you expect an average shot to be about 0.5mL, or 0.5mg, or 500mcg of fentanyl. You also expect no one to use more than 1mg or 1000mcg. If a heavy user was using your listing, that means that they would get at most a 2.5 street bag shot out of a full syringe. It&#039;s all further confused by the price as I pointed out above. I would recommend that anyone reconsider experimenting with fentanyl outside a medically prescribed situation or without previous experience. This drug has a lot of confusing statistics surrounding it, and not a lot of personal experiences listing correct dosages. Maybe someone can come by and clarify things further. Otherwise, I would watch out for the 100x vs 1000x potency. Generally, I would stay away from the stuff unless you have access to a lab or a reliable source of information.

				I&#039;ve been looking into this myself, and yeah, it&#039;s true. It&#039;s like LSD in the sence it&#039;s measured in micrograms. you can even buy it on blotters. So I&#039;m buying some dammit.<br />I would sure like some insight on the proper proceedure to cut it though… HELLLLOOOO OUT THERE…..

				Thanks, Tellmetree.<br />I&#039;ve been trying very hard to figure the best way to do this, perhaps you could hook me up with some of your insight.&nbsp; The common concesus seems to be 100mg fent HCL = 10mg of H. BUT the fentanly citrate is said to is slightly less potent, 1mg of hcl = to 1.59 of the citrate, so I&#039;d reckon&nbsp; 100 mgs would be about 7gm worth (not exact but to the best of my memory). Sound right?<br />Also when mixing it w/the lactose, do I liquify the lactose first? Or keep it dry?<br />Any good advice on how to rock the stuff up would be helpfull as well….

				a stamp bag is about 25 mg of pure diamorphine its not pure and usually far less than 100mg and stamps are always cut to shit. keys are pure (80-90%) grams are slightly less then grams go to stamps and are stepped on again. if the gram was not already stepped on 2 or 3 times. now fent is pure. so 300mcg of fent is close to a bundle of east coast street garbage (my old daily shot) and im very tollerant and the dope was shit. this compared to top of the line sr dope is 75 mg of pure heroin is about 300mcg of fent. this is off experience not science.

				It would be easier to convert from Morphine which is the gold standard for Opiates, it equaling 1. So Pure Heroin is supposed to be about 3 times the potency of Morphine. But the issue would be figuring out the potency of the street dope, and good luck...<br /><br />But I can point you to a ClearNet Site used by Doctors etc. for converting between different Opiates:<br /><br />Note: ClearNet Site do not open under TOR.<br /><br />http://www.globalrph.com/opioidconverter2.htm<br /><br />mushmold

				I got 100mg of fentanyl, i just used a pin to dose and it was fine, the vendor i got it from says that 200ug of fent is equal to like 10mg morphine or something.<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/56f48488fe he says Fentanyl/Lactose mix has been set at 15.7mg Fentanyl Citrate to 984.3mg of lactose.<br />

				Well I reckon there will be a bit of experimentation, luckily I have a concrete tolerance, when it come to opiates.

				It does sound hard to believe, but it&#039;s true, so don&#039;t go doing a whammy of a shot of the stuff… Actually don&#039;y do more than a grain of salt worth, or it&#039;s blue lips and a parametic with your wallet…If your lucky!

				50mcg of IV fent in an ambulance after a very serious injury was the highest i have ever been on opiates, i did not have any real tolerance at that time but since than i have become dependent and used high does of all kinds of opiates...... Nothing has come close to that one shot of fent, this is very potent stuff i dont think anyone should IV it outside of the hospital.
