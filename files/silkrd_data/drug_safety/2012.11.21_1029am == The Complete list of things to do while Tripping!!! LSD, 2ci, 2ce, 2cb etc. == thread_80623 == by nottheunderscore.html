				Please feel free to add to this list.&nbsp; I am thinking of tripping very soon and would like some new ideas of things to do.&nbsp; I want some creative ones...here is my list of things I&#039;ve done that were amazing on some sort of psychedelic.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Walking, being outside in nature<br />2. swimming in a pool<br />3. showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like an isolation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; <br />4. Concert<br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is insane!<br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke bubbles and regular bubbles<br />7.&nbsp; Massages - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic<br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.<br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors watching them dilate is nuts<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones like beats by dre or something similar<br />13.&nbsp; Sex (Using a vibrator with your partner)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach, being near the ocean<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells<br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously<br />20. Nitrous Oxide makes a trippy trip more trippy for a little while<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks <br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone<br />23.&nbsp; <br />24. <br />25.<br />26.&nbsp; Keep it going guys...did I leave anything out?&nbsp;

				Very nice list - actually several very good ideas there.<br /><br />I like going to a church or cementary - the vibes in such places really get me tripping and usually people won&#039;t disturb you if you are being distant and deep in thoughts in such a place.<br />Also going bicycling somewhere where there is not too many people.

				I haven&#039;t done LSD yet, but I really enjoyed sniffing some poppers when I was tripping on magic truffles. The colours intensified and it felt really good.

				1. Done it, recommended.<br />2. Done it, fucking awesome!<br />3. Deffo gonna try that before I die :D<br />6. Good idea, gonna try that.<br />8. Ermahgerd, that&#039;s by far my favorite thing to do on MXE :D<br />9. I know exactly what you&#039;re talking about! Eating can be fucking intense while tripping :D<br />10. Haven&#039;t tried acid but I&#039;ve participated in an airsoft battle on 25i. Crazy shit!<br />12. Beats by Dr. Dre suck donkey dicks (for their price at least). I recommend Shure, Sennheiser or Koss headphones ;)<br />17. I thought I was the only one using that app while tripping :D<br />20. 2C-P + nitrous = WIN ;D<br /><br />My addition:<br />23. Fuckin&#039; Lasers! I have a 200mW red, a 100mW blue and a 50mW green laser and they make for insane light shows especially when you direct them towards low hanging clouds at night and wiggle them around. You&#039;ll see tracers hundreds of meters long!<br /><br /><br />All in all I admire your &quot;tripping style&quot;, not least because it&#039;s quite similar to mine ;D<br /><br />Edit: +1&#039;d ya ;)

				*** :) ;) ;D&nbsp; I am also adding a few more that I have heard from others this week;<br /><br />1. Walking, being outside in nature...go for a hike or go camping<br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave<br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.<br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones like beats by dre or something similar<br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other.<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach, being near the ocean<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; <br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone...feels quite good.&nbsp; <br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)&nbsp; <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms as they will be set off.&nbsp; <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstacy...not too sure about other psychelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so bad.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazzing light shows.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show.&nbsp; <br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with lazer pointers if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)&nbsp; <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;8) LETS GET THIS UP to 50!&nbsp; Surely I have left something out...I&#039;m tripping tomorrow and would love some new ideas on things that will blow my mind<br /><br />

				35. Fluorescein! It&#039;s a mineral pigment that&#039;s actually red but it fluoresces in the most trippy shade of green ever! And it&#039;s dirt cheap. Combine that with a UV light and you&#039;ve got yourself pure epic win:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_51CKm5Vg-8

				lol this reminds me of bill hicks joke. &quot;awwee dude your trippin?!? you should play miniature golf!&quot;<br />i think any form of art is awesome while faced. whether it be listening to music/dancing, drawing, writing in a notebook, etc. i definitely enjoy just sitting in the dark doing nothing to reach into deep aspects of myself i couldnt grasp otherwise..<br />but with the substances you listed, social interaction is obviously great. also, skill toys. like poi, staff, led gloves, (too many to list but most people know of those three)

The ocean is incredible to swim in, thinking about how you&#039;re basically in a pool that covers the entire Earth. Then you get out and build a sand castle. <br /><br />It&#039;s the shit.

				Thanks op, now I def need a new buddy to try #3 with&nbsp; ::) I&#039;m thinking sex in general would be amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to second music (I&#039;m strumming my acoustic right now) and stargazing. That shit trips me out when I&#039;m sober. <br /><br />Also, just lay back and do some simple... thinking. I like to hop online and look at sciency stuff. Ancient history and astronomy are favorites.<br /><br />Video games if you&#039;re into those. I had some potent bud with a friend a couple months ago and we played Halo 3. I was so sucked into the game I felt like I WAS a space marine. Same with Skyrim. I was in the middle of slaughtering troops at a fort and all the sudden I had this sudden wave of empathy for the dudes... They might be Imperial scum but they had families back home, man.<br /><br />Shit gets immersive.

				GAMBLING :<br /><br />&quot;Amusingly—and sometimes amazingly—LSD-induced thought transference seems to have made its way into the gambling world, too, both amateur and professional branches, and reportedly a great deal of money has been won via the psychedelics. Halfway through one amateur gambler&#039;s session, for example, he felt a strong urge to play blackjack, and several friends accommodated him. Much to his surprise, he became aware of &quot;all kinds of subliminal signals&quot; he was unconsciously giving to others and realized that the other players, too, were telegraphing their cards. Upon correcting his own defect, he found it extraordinarily easy to win.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/staf6.htm<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try this!

				For LSD:<br />Just being outside in general is key for me, unless I&#039;m in my apartment smoking hash...but personally on acid I hate being confined in public places, I guess I&#039;m just the type more prone to get anxious. If you&#039;re in a major city and it&#039;s a nice day, going out for a walk in a busy part of the city provide for some pretty entertaining people watching. Especially when tripping and you try to gain insight into the more interesting strangers you pass just for a few seconds, catching a fleeting glimpse of them and then they&#039;re gone forever.<br /><br />Sex on acid is king for me, I recommend it highly to anyone and especially with someone you have a solid emotional connection to. If you ever have the luxury, and are a male, make sure to have your balls played with during sex - the thousands of insane vibrations and sensations produced from this on acid are fucking mindblowing, can barely be lying down without writhing uncontrollably.

				Ha. I can&#039;t believe Milkdrop got referenced on SR. Love it. Laptop to LCD tv with Milkdrop on is the background to *every* trip I take at home. Not necessarily the prime object of interest, but I&#039;ll wander past then get glued to the thing... There&#039;s a particular mandala pattern (Geiss + Flexi - confetti something) that I can get lost in for some time.<br /><br />Psyches are a major empathy multiplier for me, to the point where I have trouble eating meat, so hunting is out! lol. But I love spending time with animals while tripping, though.<br /><br />If you&#039;re somewhere where it snows, being out and about in moonlight is pretty excellent, because you can wander without light of any kind and see just fine. Then lie flat on your back and feel the earth beneath you, think about how &quot;up&quot; just goes and goes without end...<br /><br />If you&#039;ve figured out how to completely suspend disbelief, watch a wild movie, the more fantastic the better, as if the thing were a documentary.<br /><br />Love the video game mention, Skyrim in particular. Two recent experiences:<br />i) I&#039;m on this aqueduct (?!) by some Forsworn camp. It&#039;s night and the whole scene is moonlit. I blast some archer at the end of the aqueduct with a fireball and then start running against the current along the aqueduct. Well, the moonlight on the water as I ran against the current... it was fucking amazing. Meanwhile arrows are zinging past my ear from the ground but I barely notice, turn around, run back with the current to the start so I can do it all over again<br />ii) I wander into this Imperial camp at night. There&#039;s a guy sharpening his weapon on a grindstone, a conversation in low tones a little ways away, a guy sitting drinking from a tankard, and the campfire. It was just so *cosy* that I immediately settled by the fire and just kinda... stayed there. For a long, long while. (I didn&#039;t get camping much this summer IRL and this just somehow hit the vibe)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=80623.msg635300#msg635300">Quote from: psychedelia on November 30, 2012, 01:11 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Much to his surprise, he became aware of &quot;all kinds of subliminal signals&quot; he was unconsciously giving to others and realized that the other players, too, were telegraphing their cards.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This seems entirely believable to me.

				I&#039;ve never enjoyed looking at a computer screen when I&#039;m tripping; something about electronics bothers me.&nbsp; I always prefer organic textures, wood grain, clouds, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised nobody has said the rain!&nbsp; I spent ~5 hours sitting in my car with the engine off watching raindrops hit my windshield.&nbsp; And if it&#039;s a light rain, being outside in it is really empowering.

				I don&#039;t suggest tripping at night. In a home. I dropped two tabs on some sweet tarts that my buddy gave me the other night. Pretty fucking strong. Best acid trip I&#039;ve ever had for sure. But my back was fucking killing me. anyone know why? But I will say that I took some shrooms once and went swimming. Jesus. That was awesome. Just letting your body float in the water and gazing at the sky. truly breathtaking.

				HERE IS THE COMPLETE UPDATED LIST.&nbsp; ;D ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at everyones suggestions and here is the full list of amaaaaaazing things to do while tripping.&nbsp; If you did even 1/4 of the things on here, you&#039;d have the best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Walking, being outside in nature...go for a hike or go camping.&nbsp; Stare at the Moon.<br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave <br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.&nbsp; <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other.<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.&nbsp; <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.

				HERE IS THE COMPLETE UPDATED LIST.&nbsp; ;D ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at everyones suggestions and here is the full list of amaaaaaazing things to do while tripping.&nbsp; If you did even 1/4 of the things on here, you&#039;d have the best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Walking, being outside in nature...go for a hike or go camping.&nbsp; Stare at the Moon.<br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though. <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave<br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it. <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!! <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good. <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to. <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other.<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt. <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.) <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off. <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself) <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museaum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining. <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer?&nbsp; I’m told this is cool on Acid but I have yet to try it, lots of people recommend it. <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid. <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />45.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day, <br /><br />Any other suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />

You, sir, know your headphones ;-) I DJ and ever since my first pair of Koss&#039;s, I haven&#039;t ever gone back to anything else. Sennheiser would be my #2. I wouldn&#039;t buy a microphone that didn&#039;t say Shure on it. The sound and bass is sooo rich with the set I have on my head right now. Bose isn&#039;t bad, but it&#039;s kinda like Lay&#039;s Potato Chips. They&#039;re good as hell but ehhh. I use the QZ900&#039;s for sitting at the house, and I JUST bought the striva pro&#039;s for my sets. I didn&#039;t think they&#039;d ever be able to do it wirelessly, but like they say there, hearing is believing lol.

I would research it a little more in depth, as I&#039;m not positive I am explaining it very well.. haha.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, when I first saw the goggles, I thought that they could possibly be used in conjunction with these methods in a chemically enhanced environment to great effect. :D

				I can believe you&#039;ve never drank beer on lsd. I thought everyone drank it&#039;s like a rite of passage. my buddies and i usually get 3 30packs of beer and a whifle ball set. whifle ball is amazing while tripping.

I am assuming you have a ton of experience with psychedelics so you are probably able to control yourself more than the average psychonaut, but I cannot imagine being that intoxicated and being able to function on a normal level.. I suppose it is a goal toward which one works, to be able to recognize one&#039;s altered state and control one&#039;s perception and response to it.<br /><br />Regarding your thoughts and experiences, while I am admittedly not even close to an expert on the subject, what you described meshes with what I understand of quantum theory and quantum mechanics. <br /><br />On a slightly related, but fictional, note: your report reminds me very much of the omnipresent visions of time and space that Paul Muad Dib experiences in the book Dune while on the drug melange.&nbsp; It makes one wonder if Frank Herbert drew from any experience with psychedelics.&nbsp; I know that he researched Buddhism and Taoism, as well as epic hero lore extensively, but I don&#039;t know whether he was into psychedelics at all.&nbsp; It would be interesting to find out.

				Watch this video while tripping !<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQq_XmhBTgg<br /><br />&quot;How to Operate Your Brain&quot; by Timothy Leary<br /><br />This video produces some very intense experiences when watched in a dark room.<br /><br />similar to the effects of a strobe light during a psychedelic experience, except with leary providing a form of guidance for the experience at the same time

				Aromasticks burning is just great on LSD. Find the ones that smells &#039;cold&#039; or &#039;minty&#039;. They are awesome.<br /><br />Few days ago I had a WONDERFUL trip. Few hours of ecstasy (better than on MDMA) and out-of-body experience, having strange feeling of multiplying inner &#039;me&#039;. I did few things from that list, so thank you guys, it was terrific.<br /><br />- strawberries were awesome<br />- smelling perfume was giving me high<br />- loud music by RUSH and AC/DC was driving me wild. Jesus Christ Superstar was so vivid, that I felt myself within the characters.<br /><br />Thank you for advices, let&#039;s keep discovering!<br /><br />By the way this time I had a lot of ginger-lemon tea, and the trip was the best I ever had and the best I could ever wish and imagine. I think that was also because ginger always giving me great mood and body high. Try it too!

				Also i&#039;ve been playing virtual MOOG synthesizer. It is an app called &quot;AmiMOOG&quot; for iPad. Some sounds were very hypnotic. I had a great time playing with it. I am not musician, but I do love making weird sounds with my guitar or some computer software.<br />And on acid it is getting even more awesome.

				I went to a reflexologist while tripping on acid.&nbsp; Oh man, oh man oh man, greatest massage ever!!!&nbsp; Reflexology, as you know, is all about the nerve ending in the feet connecting to the rest of your body.&nbsp; It was quite an experience, I really had to fight laughing at points, but overall it felt amazing.&nbsp; They also do practically a full body massage.

				You&#039;ve left out one of my favourites: tagging.&nbsp; Depending on where you are, this can be quite dangerous (in terms of getting caught), but if you choose the right setting, it&#039;s incredible.&nbsp; I did this a few times at a place in the Nevadan desert called the American Flats.&nbsp; Look it up ... this is an astoundingly cool trip environment.<br /><br />Also: playing music.&nbsp; Someone mentioned it earlier ... but seriously, how can THAT not be on the list?&nbsp; The best is when you&#039;ve got 4 or 5 of you who are all tripping jamming together.

				??.&nbsp; Take a slightly higher dose than you are comfortable with and lay in your bed with all electronics off (no lights, no music, no phone, no computer).. McKenna style.<br /><br />It&#039;s quite rewarding and is my favourite way to trip these days.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit difficult and uncomfortable, but well worth it.

				my last three trips i have ended up listening to satanic panic in the attic by of montreal. it is perfect for tripping, the vocal harmonies are incredibly lush, the basslines are orgasmic (i play bass myself and i honestly feel they are near perfect, in the perfect place at the perfect time), and the melodies are both light &amp; poppy while also incredibly intricate, interesting and unexpected (the chord progression in Eros&#039; Entropic Tundra comes to mind). overall it gives off a great vibe on LSD, 2C-B, and P. Cubensis and seems to keep the setting positive and conducive to visuals. If nothing else i urge you to listen to the tracks Lysergic Bliss, Eros&#039; Entropic Tundra, and Spike The Senses.<br /><br />other than that:<br />i love the outdoors and running feels great, almost weightless.<br />being around my girlfriend, another close friend, and/or pets<br />and on my last shroom trip i ended up doing some form of yoga/tai chi that i did not know i was capable of and look forward to trying this on LSD<br /><br />good trips to all :)

				Not sure if this one has been mentioned yet but...<br /><br />Blacklight painting with my girlfriend is always a great time. she gets naked and I paint her like an Aztec warrior. when she&#039;s covered in paint she&#039;s glowing so bright. There is something extremely sexy about it. I&#039;ve done this on 2c-e a bunch, and on LSD once. The 2c-e seemed to be more fun with blacklight painting. However they&#039;re both amazingly awesome.

				Went camping with someone and had about 7g of Psilocybe cubensis. The tent had a small window which seemed to be a window to the whole world. The really trippy part was the rain, thunder, and lightening that followed. Good times with mother nature. :)

				I plan on buying some Gallium soon. It is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping. <br /><br />Listen to Terence McKenna!!! He was a brilliant man. You will learn a hell of a lot from Terence McKenna. Trust me.<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxfn5PFWYTk<br /><br /><br />Singing is amazing when you&#039;re tripping. Just do it. you&#039;ll see.

				Updated Again!! ;)&nbsp; ;D ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at everyone&#039;s suggestions and here is the full list of amaaaaaazing things to do while tripping.&nbsp; If you did even 1/4 of the things on here, you&#039;d have the best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Walking, being outside in nature, even when its raining.&nbsp; Go for a hike, explore or go camping.&nbsp; Staring at the moon can be an experience in itself.&nbsp; <br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave <br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, foot massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; Download the presets by googling: bltc winamp&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.&nbsp; <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other (black-light paint perhaps)<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.&nbsp; <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)&nbsp; <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.&nbsp; <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers, legos or clay if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)&nbsp; <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining.&nbsp; <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid.&nbsp; <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petting a cat or a furry animal. <br />45.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />46.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />47. stream of consciousness writing<br />48.&nbsp; Buy some Gallium online.&nbsp; Gallium is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping.<br />49.&nbsp; Go to a reflexologist or have a masseuse (if you can handle interacting with people while tripping that is)&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know what reflexology is, google it and go do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s mind-blowing. <br />Any other suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />

Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blueberries, Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good. <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paint-balling on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to. <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other (black-light paint perhaps)<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt. <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.) <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off. <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers, legos or clay if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself) <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining. <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer<br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid. <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself, or Snap a picture here and there.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petting a cat or a furry animal.<br />45.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />46.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />47. stream of consciousness writing<br />48.&nbsp; Buy some Gallium online.&nbsp; Gallium is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping.<br />49.&nbsp; Go to a reflexologist or have a masseuse (if you can handle interacting with people while tripping that is)&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know what reflexology is, google it and go do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s mind-blowing.<br />50. Go to a Zoo.<br />51. Sit in a dark room...no light at all (With friends or without) Music on or Music off...Stay in there for at least 5 minutes, and watch the circus.&nbsp; In the absences of visual stimulation your mind will start to create it&#039;s own show.&nbsp; Quite an experience!<br />52. Sit in a dark room and have just one strobe-light going off at a medium pace.&nbsp; You can actually tailor the strobe light to go off with the same frequency of your brain-waves somehow...(That&#039;s coming from an LSD documentary, a doctor recommended it)&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to try it myself.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />53. Go to a Diner at the end of the Experience and recharge your brain.&nbsp; Reminisce with your tripping partners on your experience (Go Through any pictures you may&#039;ve taken)<br />Any other suggestions?
