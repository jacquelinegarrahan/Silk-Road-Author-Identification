				@ OP, you should train Mice to carry the shit on their back and deliver on whistle command and have a train a Gorilla in the use of a machete to ensure you get the payments. You should train the Gorilla (who you should name Dennis) to attack at the sound of a joke car horn &quot;BAAAAHMMMM&quot;. You should also also dress the Gorilla in a red silk dressing gown and get a tshirt for yourself that says &quot;Cock-Smoker&quot; Cock is a code word for crack you see and smoker....well yeah so it makes you easily identifiable as the man without a plan.

				Make sure your car has hydraulics, or at least drive an Escalade. This way, your buyers will know you&#039;re legit and the police won&#039;t suspect a thing.

				Far as I know, you can always buy a prepaid phone without ID. Never been carded once, and I&#039;ve bought dozens at many different places. Anyway, here is my tip, go down to the local police station and tell them you will be dealing drugs so whoever you need to payoff should contact you. Leave a business card and make sure your job title says &quot;Drug Dealer.&quot; A direct approach is always best.

				I sell weed, and I don&#039;t smoke it. In fact, I&#039;ve outright refused to smoke it when customers who were unknown to me have requested it. I can&#039;t stand the buzz, smell, taste, etc. In my opinion, however, if you sell a particular drug, you *shouldn&#039;t* be actively consuming it if you want to make any money.<br /><br />If you&#039;re like me though, you can just show skeptics the track mark scars all over your body to prove that you&#039;re not LE. This technique can apply to users of *any* drug. For example:<br /><br />Crack: burnt lips<br />Meth: missing teeth/facial scars from digging<br />Ecstasy: your prescription of anti-depressants<br />Marijuana: your high school report card<br />LSD: the chain that you use to tie yourself to trees to prevent forestation<br />Mushrooms: your overall demeanor at any given time<br />Salvia: the broken furniture all over your house<br />Heroin: the lack of furniture all over your house<br />Cocaine: your jar of rolled-up $1 bills that cashiers refuse to accept due to the boogers covering the ends of each one<br /><br />The list goes on and on. If you do any type of drug on the regular, you possess *something* that you can display as proof if the need ever arises.
