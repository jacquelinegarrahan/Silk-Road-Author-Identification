				I want to say also that it happens and its best to simply give you the best advice I can rather than say dont cut it.<br />Theres pros and cons to certain cuts.<br />Vyvanse/adderal/speed are ussually cheaper and typically white so they blend well, but the issue is anyone with a brain will notice that it lasts much longer than coke should and that is a downside. Caffeine will do the same, but will allow the user to sleep 2+ hours after ingestion which is a major plus.<br /><br />I think I would reccomend cooking crack rocks as the baking soda adds weight (not 100% sure, never done it but I would have to assume it works like that).<br />It basically works by cooking cocaine water and baking soda in a pan

				Sorry but heres some tuff love too: <br />Dealing coke is a business of ruining lives. If you are doing coke, you are ruining your own. Your confidence will be higher while high, but when you run out you will be angry and unpleasant. Your confidence will fade, and you will be less confident than before using. You will find yourself irritable and unnapealing. You will make 1 or 2 very pretty lady friends who will stab you in the back after your out of coke.

				I&#039;ve always thought creatine monohydrate would make a good cut. I&#039;ve no idea what it feels like to snort, but it has no real taste or smell and just appears as a white slightly crystalline powder. You can get it from anywhere that sells sports nutrition products or protein shakes.

I do quite a bit of coke as it&#039;s my favourite drug and really, so long as you keep it under lock, it&#039;s fine. You are talking about addicts rather than recreational users. If you are one of those people who got hooked then shit one for you I guess but not all users are like that. I am certainly not, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t be able to function here. <br /><br />Sorry to sound harsh but it really gets on my wick when people tar people that use Coke with the same brush when any drug used irresponsibly will end in tears.

				You are certainly correct. I was addicted to the idea of coke before I tried it, so it became a problem for me very quickly.<br />Also I was predisposed to the addiction without knowing it, because I had realized much later that I had smoked coke laced weed 3 times and did coke I was told was molly before trying it intentionally. <br />I feel as though coke makes me a worse person, personally. I will not speak for others, though.

				The most popular dealer in my area is well known and popular because he sells smaller amounts of pure product. People rave about how little you need to get high, how clean it feels, and how good the product is. Recently he started cutting it, and his popularity has declined. Just something to consider.

				i never got too deep into the coke scene, but i thought it was well understood that the coke gets cut by every dealer who gets his hand on it (excluding the importer).&nbsp; i had a coke dealing friend who used to cut his shit with powdered coffee creamer...i even remember one time when a customer of his said &quot;hey you gotta put more cut in that stuff, its too strong.&quot;&nbsp; can you imagine being that much of an idiot?&nbsp; I should mention that this story did indeed take place in an american ghetto where people are fucking retarded.

				I&#039;m not a coke dealer, but I like my coke as much as the next person.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see why you feel the need to cut your coke even more than iit is. Sure, you get more coke for yourself or else more moneyy.<br />Don&#039;t cut it, and you will have satisfied customers that will return, which will generate mor elong term business and money!<br />Just my 2 cents anyway1

Shit the stuff from here that I buy for myself would sell for £120 a gram in the U.K<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Which vendor are you getting this from bro? <br /><br />Thanks :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I buy from either Dutchaanbod or Pfand and I am half way though a buy with SuperTrips now. Pfand I am not sure is still in the race but I fully recommend Dutchaan who is on holiday at the moment. SuperTrips this is my first time round with but I have all faith in him. Dutchaan&#039;s product comes out at 80% and so does or did Pfands because Dutchaan supplied him. SuperTrips is saying his is 85-89% pure. So yeah, you can see why it&#039;s be worth £100-£120 here.

				Understand your position Sara but I&#039;m just basing what I say purely on personal experience. I remember when all that happened seeing your posts about it and the posts by everyone else so I have no doubt your telling the truth mate, there was a huge divide between those who got the brown crap and the white tacky stuff. If I&#039;d have got the brown I&#039;d have gone crazy-goose too. It&#039;s all a moot point now thought because Pfand&#039;s retired by the looks of things so I guess we can only speculate on what happened there. I switched to try SuperTrips now so looking forward to seeing how that turns out, so far he&#039;s been great to deal with. :)<br /><br />Back-tracking from this tangent though. DON&#039;T CUT!

				i&#039;ve seen everything used from calcium powder to meth (!)... caffeine and initosol are alright, but generally coke will never be so strong compared to local quality that it NEEDS to be cut- some things in some places (like heroin) you might want to cut for safety reasons
