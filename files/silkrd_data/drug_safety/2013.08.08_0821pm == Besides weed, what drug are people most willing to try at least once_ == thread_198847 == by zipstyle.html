				Good question.<br /><br />Over the years I&#039;ve mixed ina&nbsp; few circles, from poor to pretty rich. The drug I find is pretty acceptable to most people aside from weed or hash is actually cocaine. That is seen as a &#039;normal&#039; drug and one that does not give the user any real risk of losing the plot, tripping or hallucinating.<br /><br />People who don&#039;t do drugs, usually means they drink. I&#039;ve seen many people at parties get drunk then get curious about other drugs. I usually advise anyone drunk to avoid coke, (mixing the two is not wise) but weed is cool, its good for annoying drunks as it soon gets them green in the face, dizzy and dazed. <br /><br />At one time coke was a &#039;serious&#039; drug. but these days I&#039;d say that its a drug many will just have a go of for a bit of change.<br /><br />MDMA is too overbearing for most normal folk who don&#039;t get high.<br /><br />Heroin is a no go. Most people into it regret using for that first time. I&#039;d always advise anyone to strike that off the list of drugs to try because its the one drug you can try once and end up wanting it everyday, morning, noon and night. Coke can be addictive, but most people do it as a special treat, never in work, hopefully once a week tops because that way you keep a good tolerance for the stuff. <br /><br />RCs, younger people might be reckless enough to try any but anyone over the age of 30 is likely to be wary of new untested and unproven drugs that might leave you ok whilst turning any kids you have into vegatables. <br /><br />After cannabis and hash I think coke is the second most common drug of choice and therefore likely to be something many would try out, if it was on the table!<br /><br />Mushrooms, its not common for people to jump in at the deep end. I love them but its not an indoors drug for me. Need to be in the great outdoors, wrapped in a blanket, with a stick, with a flourescent armband or waistcoat.

The flourescent shit makes us feel safe, seeing the glow of fellow trippers, its reassuring when your seeing trees grow arms and the sky looking like it always does when your tripping. Bloody wierd! Amazing! Sometimes scary! <br /><br />So shrroms are out. You don&#039;t pop that in your non drug using buddies cup.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />LSD for the no drug user type is like giving a bottle of whiskey to a teetotaller.<br /><br />Benzos are not really drugs people take for the experience. Its more just a safety net for stimulant sleeplessness. Ease any come downs. Not a drug I&#039;d take just to get high on as it puts me to sleep.<br /><br />I guess amphetamine is in there also. A drug that presents no danger of losing a sense of being! Makes your aunties clean the ornaments. Sadly, itys a drug that I find to have too many downsides to justify using it. 12 hours of fun followed by a week of feeling like shit. Still, its a drug a lot wil try the once. Its not too bad if your young and healthy. <br /><br />The older you get the more you tend to dislike speed and in my circles most have given that up and would use coke instead because its pretty easy to wake up on Monday at 7.00am and go to work anjd sometimes actually do some work.

				I tend to agree with the above - cocaine is something that is used fairly commonly and does not have the &#039;junky&#039; stigma to it that substances like heroin or meth do. In may even be considered fashionable by some. <br /><br />As for benzo&#039;s: may people are willing to try them as sleep aids, even in serious dosages, but i&#039;ve rarely encountered anyone inexperienced with them that would consider them of any recreational value. <br />

It sucks that my two least favorite drugs are weed and coke.

				Good question, probably because the answer I think is complex.<br /><br />It all depends on the current social norms. In the 60-70s most people would have tried LSD, but not now. People generally follow their peer group. The UK government keeps saying drug use is decreasing, and it is, but only in the drugs that have been around for years. All the new stuff is being ignored.<br /><br />Unfortunately people equate legal with OK to take. Legal high use has shot up;<br /><br />Nitrous Oxide was used by 350,000 people last year in the UK<br /><br />Cocaine is the most popular drug after weed. Thus is makes sense that people will take that because others have taken it in their peer group.<br /><br />Type of drug use also depends on other factors such as income, environment and even education. For example. Those earning less than 10,000 GBP a year take the most Amphetamines. While those earning 40-50K are more likely to take MDMA. <br /><br />Thus if you have little experience with drugs, you will follow your peer group and social norms around you. which makes the answer complex.<br /><br />But generally across all demographics, coke is the most popular, tus the drug that people are lkely to come into contact with after Alcohol.<br /><br />Check out http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/25/britons-illegal-drugs-who-they [clearnet]<br /><br />That gives you some idea of the trends and what is being used.<br /><br />FH<br /><br />

				Legal: Alcohol, caffeine, tobacco/nicotine <br /><br />illegal: Cocaine, mushrooms, certain prescription pills.<br /><br />It is difficult to give an answer(s) that generalizes the group of people who do not use drugs recreationally. These people don&#039;t do drugs, so some may be willing to try harder stuff once or twice.

				Most people are willing to try weed because the side effect and toxicity profile is virtually nil. <br /><br />In that vein, the best is probably psychedelics. I&#039;d start with the smoother ones like LSD first.&nbsp; Shrooms can be a little to mind-fucked to really do much, and may give the perception that drugs are &#039;too much&#039;. <br /><br /><br /><br />The hardest to get people to try are the ones with huge toxicity profiles and stigma.&nbsp; Not many people will be up to trying IV heroin, but offer a beginner&#039;s dose percoset, and suddenly the drug changes completely to them ::)

				I suppose that many people would be affraid to try hallucinogens like lsd or mushrooms - not because they are very dangerous to physical health, but because their effects coud basically be anything negative or positive. <br /><br />Something like cocaine basically equates to snorting the equivalent to a litre of coffee for most people, something they will be quite comfortable with. <br /><br />Cannabis is not something i&#039;d include in this list since most people will experience it somewhere in their teenage years, and it is not really a border to cross. It is not hard to obtain, it&#039;s effects usually are minor compared to alcohol, and it&#039;s dangers are virtually zero.

				on the harm list of drugs mdma comes below anything else that might be mentioned think it was somewhere between poppers (amyl nitrate) and lsd (at no.18 in a scientific study) and fell way below alcohol tobaco and even weed, the only trouble with it is the propaganda that surrounds it, but the fact that were all on first name terms with its victims speaks volumes, the fact that their deaths were INDIRECTLY linked to mdma speaks even more ie drinking too much water mixing other substances........everyone should try sum magic ;-)

				For me, the first thing I went to was shrooms, as I thought &quot;as long as its natural its okay&quot;.&nbsp; Some people don&#039;t like the thought of hallucinating, so psychedelics are a no go many times.&nbsp; So I&#039;d have to agree with redalloverthelandguyhere on this one - a common 2nd drug is coke.&nbsp; Though many will try MDMA first, as it many times does not have quite the same stigma as coke.&nbsp; I have cousins who never touched a drug in their life aside from maybe smoking a little weed once or twice, and they still did MDMA while out at a club drinking (and one lost their shit).&nbsp; So really, I think it varies for people and it likely depends on the crowds you run with, and where you live.&nbsp; <br /><br />For me, I went booze, weed, shrooms, Rx opioids/opiates, acid, MDMA, Cocaine, Ketamine, Meth, heroin, crack.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t real big on the meth or crack, and got fully burned out on coke, so I will no longer touch the shit.&nbsp; Still smoke a little weed and do the occasional opiates though (heroin mostly).&nbsp; <br /><br />But to answer simply, I would say the next most common drugs after weed are defo MDMA and coke. IMHO anyhow.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

I kid you not! They must have been on a training exercise. They didn&#039;t see us, thank fuck, but we soon got out of there, double quick time! Never again lol. Still tripped out in the countryside (my favourite tripping scenario), but just not at night anymore!<br />Sorry to interrupt the thread but it just struck a chord.

In the 90s taking xtc was very popular at raves (then called house parties, but you get the idea). Many people in europe have experience with xtc themselves, or at least have friends that used to take the drug at some point in the past - usually with little negative effect at all. <br /><br />Due to these experiences europeans generally do not consider xtc a particularly dangerous drug, with stories of fatality only detailing things like dancing so long dehydration sets in and causes people to collapse and in a few cases die. I suppse the idea is that you will be okay taking xtc als long as you keep properly hydrated and/or refrain from jumping around like an idiot for hours at a time :D<br />
