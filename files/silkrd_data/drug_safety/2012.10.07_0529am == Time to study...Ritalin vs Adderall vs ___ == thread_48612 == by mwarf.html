				Title sums up my situation. Looking for &quot;study aids&quot; to get through a class that is utterly kicking my ass. Heard some people use Ritalin, heard some use Adderall and maybe Im missing a few. Anyone have some experience with this situation that can offer some advice?

				give dexedrine a quick google search. Just off the top of my head, there&#039;s also concerta, vyvanse, and focalin. I&#039;ve only had adderal, ritalin and vyvanse, but I had the most success (study wise) with vyvanse; supposedly, it is also less habit forming. Oddly, some have also reported success with small doses of MDPV<br />Personally, I&#039;m going to give amphetamine sulfate a shot. Even if I don&#039;t get anything done, it&#039;ll still be fun as hell ;D<br />Happy studies<br /><br />-schmuck

				from personal experience, Adderall seems to last longer than Ritalin...<br />also, i don&#039;t know how else to explain it but Adderall feels &quot;cleaner&quot; than Ritalin....<br />Ritalin feels kind of like an adrenaline rush because of its SNRI effect...<br />Ritalin did help me focus...but not as solidly as Adderall...Ritalin gave me more of a feeling of urgency to get things done...<br />Adderall just makes everything so clear...I&#039;m able to look at a problem and the steps to solve it just fall into place like bam bam bam...<br />the dopaminergic effects of Adderall make it feel more rewarding than Ritalin as you complete your tasks...<br />Adderall also seems to come up and come down more smoothly than Ritalin...<br />Ritalin just kinda hits you and then drops off and goes away after a couple hours<br />i&#039;m able to pull all nighters off just 10mg of Adderall...

				dextro amphetamine is the way to go, adderall is just d-amp with some l-amp which is less clean, heady and euphoric, plus half is combined with a sugar molecule to slow distribution<br /><br />dexedrine is pure d-amp but is much more rare and so likely expensive, its instant release though so better if you snort or short of course.&nbsp; but vyvanse is a more common drug these days which i am pretty sure is a prodrug for d-amp, meaning in your body it is converted and then you get the clean d-amp high but the release is slower which reduces the abuse potential and makes the duration longer

				I&#039;d also like to add that after taking Ritalin for a while, I started feeling like a robot...it was a little depressing and I didn&#039;t like the person I was turning into...<br />Adderall seems to just flip the switch that allows me to get work done for the duration of its effects and when it wears off I return to being my normal self...

				OK I have to say this. There is a misconception that Dexedrine is the best. First of all Adderall is composed of 4 different amphetamine salts, 1 of them being dextroamphetamine. One adderall pill has roughly 75% dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and the the remaining 25% is roughly equally split between the other three amphetamine isomers. I have taken adderall, dexedrine, vyvanse, and methylphenidate. I have all 4 of these and I take the adderall over the others. Ill sometimes add a dex into the mix but generally I save them for misinformed people who pay ridiculously high prices for them. IMHO 20mg of adderall is equal to 40mg of Dex. and even then it really is hard to acurately compare the 2. Adderall is much more... noticeable. You REALLY feel it. Dont get suckered into paying out the ass for this stuff either. SR prices on amphetamines are, how do you say... NUTS. (1) 20mg addy should cost you $5. If your in school ask around and you will surely find someone with a script. Lastly read up at erowid.org.
