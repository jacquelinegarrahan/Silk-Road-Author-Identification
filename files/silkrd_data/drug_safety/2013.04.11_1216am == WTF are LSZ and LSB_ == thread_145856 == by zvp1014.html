				I&#039;m finding absolutely no info online. Seeing as how I don&#039;t want to ingest a substance that I have absolutely no idea what it does, I&#039;d like some clarification.<br /><br />I&#039;d purchased from a seller 5 120 µg LSB blotters- Yes, LSB, which was an accident in and of itself as I wasn&#039;t paying attention. I wanted LSD, was browsing in the LSD section, so my mind didn&#039;t realize it said &#039;LSB&#039; instead of &#039;LSD.&#039;<br /><br />But then I get the following message-<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Hello friend .<br />I receive data from my product. My supplier make a mistake and this products its not LSB but LSZ -&gt; there you have analysis http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ufzsqb&amp;s=6 but dosage is for LSZ ( 50 ug - 300 ug) , its very rare lizergamide . I hope that you are not angry ;-) Its still good product<br />Cheers&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wtf is LSB, and more importantly, wtf is LSZ?

				Sounds like the vendor is a) non-english speaking, perhaps he misspelled something..., b) doesn&#039;t know wtf he&#039;s dealing.<br />I&#039;d be a little concerned and perhaps ponder a partial refund. Yes, you ordered it, yes you received it, however, he didn&#039;t actually send what he advertised.<br />As to your question about wtf these substances are, perhaps they are cousins of some sort of lsd? Couldn&#039;t find a whole lot of info (and quite frankly am not reading through 8 million pages atm, sorry)<br />Good luck man! Definitely don&#039;t ingest it.

Or is it simply a grey area due to them not being studied as much?<br /><br />I&#039;m not too happy on the thought of taking a drug that has little safety profile in the medical field, never mind any trip reports.<br /><br />If I do decide to ingest it and enjoy it, I&#039;ll probably just finalize. Otherwise I really do feel I should be refunded somewhat as I didn&#039;t order LSZ and the seller admitted their fault which would create a case in my favor. I just dislike how it affects my buyer ratings; I&#039;ve had two failed MDMA orders I was refunded from and one failed LSD order. I don&#039;t want to dip into the range where sellers require me to finalize early, as I was scammed by Lucydrop that way.

				Against my better judgement I just ingested a tab. We&#039;ll see how it goes. It tasted incredibly bitter, definitely not LSD.<br /><br />Also, received this message:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello. I am in the same position as you about the LSZ. I also ordered tabs from what I suppose is the same vendor, thinking it said &quot;LSD&quot;, instead it said LSB, don&#039;t know how I didn&#039;t catch it. I got the same message today from the vendor saying it was actually LSZ along with a mass spec graph. Now, LSZ was developed as a rigid analogue to LSD, and should have the same effects, if not slightly more potent. However, there is no good reason why anyone would make LSZ.<br /><br />a. Just as hard to make as LSD<br />b. Requires the same illegal, incredibly expensive and impossible to acquire precursors.<br />c. Has a quarter the yield of LSD<br /><br />LSB is another LSD analogue, and I don&#039;t think it really is out in the wild either, which makes this somewhat plausible I guess.<br /><br />I&#039;m having a friend look at the mass spec to see if it&#039;s actually LSZ. Once tabs come I hope to find a way to test it myself in case the spectrometer results were tampered with.<br /><br />I hope the tabs aren&#039;t really DOx or 25-x. Be careful with the tabs until we find out what they are, just in case they might be one of those two.<br /><br />I can&#039;t reply to your topic because I don&#039;t have 50 posts, but feel free to copy paste this into the topic. I want to know what&#039;s going on as well.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />BlackAres</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Having some visual fun. Text is bulging in and out and doing flips and such. When I move my hands, there are ghost images of where it previously was that follow it until I set my hand still. But there&#039;s not much else. I haven&#039;t been on a psychedelic in a while so it isn&#039;t a tolerance issue.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t what I paid for. No closed eye visuals, nothing. I did redose with two more tabs but that was almost immediately after I took the first one, 3-4 minutes later.<br /><br />This is weaksauce... I just hope I get my money back.

				The LSM tabs were also incredibly bitter (one person even gagged and puked up a bit just trying to swallow one, they tasted like total shit). Effect wise they felt a bit more speedy than LSD, lacking in the deeper psychedelic effects to some extent, but with a much more club drug, rushy, euphoric feeling to them. It felt like a close cousin of LSD, notably different but obviously related. My favorite part about it was that I could take it multiple days in a row and still get good effects, something that is next to impossible with LSD.

				3 tabs (120µg) + 2 tabs redose once the effects were diminishing lasted roughly 3 hours, was very boring and tasted horrid.

That sounds exactly like one of the nbomes. They are visually similar to LSD while being less introspective and speedier. They are also very, very bitter and just taste downright awful.

				Then again after reading the effects on nbomes , it does sound quite similar. I also see dystonia listed, and this was a reported effect from those blotters. Maybe the smart European acid groups were using nbomes before they were in mainstream public awareness, I know they were using jwh-018 as spice long before the general public knew what jwh-018 was, but I had known about that over a year before Spice was mainstream.
