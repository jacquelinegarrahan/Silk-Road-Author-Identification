				Hi guys<br /><br />I have ordered 5g of MDMA from NL through SR. Unfortunately when we&#039;ve been testing this MDMA, we didn&#039;t feel something like euphoria and we felt a lot of empathy instead. In addition, each of us felt the desire to want to sleep. Is it normall on pure MDMA? I think it&#039;s something wrong with it...<br /><br />Thanks Buy

				What were your dosage in mgs and are you on any kinda anti depressants?<br />MDMA does cause some you rest and rise with a nice overall feeling of well being&nbsp; but shouldn&#039;t be putting you to sleep directly. <br />How long did you &quot;sleep&quot;?<br />:D<br /><br />nomad bloodbath

				empathy is very common on real mdma, its one of the things i look for to judge a pill if i dont have a test kit available. my advice is to test it if your unsure, depends where you live but test kits are pretty easy/cheap/legal to obtain, alot of the time &#039;head shops&#039; or bong shops will sell them or you can get them online easy aswell. they are simple as anything to use too.

				I agree that the empathy part makes sense, but I&#039;ve always felt a need to get up and move around.&nbsp; Even thinking of sleep is near impossible for me while rolling.

				actually, this is pretty common. During the comeup I always yawn a few times and want to stretch out, sometimes it even feels like falling asleep but even if you try, you are not going to sleep.<br />I believe it has something to do with serotonin, but I had to read it up to be absolutely sure.<br />Anyway, the effects you describe are nothing out of the ordinary ;)

				A few years ago I used to be able to fall asleep right after rolling on a good pill, now its hard even 4-5 hours after one good cap or pill. And I know the purity is better than those times a few years ago.

				Perhaps you&#039;re deficient in neurotransmitter precursors, or maybe pyridoxal?

				On a light dose like 60 - 75 mg I will often lay in bed and listen to music in kinda half sleepy half euphoric state, especially if Im already tired. On higher doses i get too much energy and desire to interact with others to think about sleep. Of course the only way to really tell if its good is reagent testing, but what you descibe sounds fairly normal.
