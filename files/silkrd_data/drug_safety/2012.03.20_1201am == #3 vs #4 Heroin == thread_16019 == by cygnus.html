				What is the difference between #3 and #4? I know that some forms don&#039;t just break down in water, you need citric acid or something like that, so I was wondering which one is which? I&#039;m used to ok black tar from the street, i don&#039;t know that much about good powder, thanks for the help<br /><br />cygnus

				#3 needs citric acid to dissolve for IV, but it a lot more readily smoke-able than #4<br />#4 dissolves in water, but is generally not used for smoking.

				thanks man, thats the answer i was looking for. #4 it is :P i&#039;ve never really enjoyed smoking h, i shot more often with the tar i got because it saved what i could afford for longer. i find it easier to just work with something that will dissolve in water for iv purposes.<br /><br />Another question, for the tar i had i would need to cook out the shit cut that was there, but how much cooking is needed for #4?

				Honestly? I haven&#039;t shot a whole lot of either.&nbsp; It should dissolve in cold water, but I&#039;ve heard conflicting stories on whether or not to cook it.&nbsp; Sorry&nbsp; ???

				thanks man. i&#039;ll proabably sterilize water, or get bacteriostatic solution to mix it with, then let it cool to see how well it will dissolve before i shoot. my tolerance is gone though, so i&#039;m going to have to take it pretty slow starting off. i had a high natural tolerance with tar, but i&#039;m pretty sure this is on a whole other level.<br /><br />compared to the shit i used to shoot, i&#039;m shouldn&#039;t be that worried about cooking as long as i&#039;m dissolving into a sterile substance. i just got curious haha

				When you Iv #4 all you need is a little heat until the powder dissolves. Like 3-5sec max under the spoon.<br /><br />Totally different than tar since you need to cook the shit out of it like you said.<br /><br />Do you IV tar more than powder? Cause Tar imo has a stronger nod and has just as long legs as bomb powder<br /><br />Also all you need is distilled water.

				my experience with iv is all tar, i wanted to try some higher quality h from SR as the tar was usually cut to shit with god knows what. I loved the nod from tar just for sitting in an apartment all day, i really just want the bliss from it again, i miss my body feeling so relaxed, warm and itchy :P. <br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely use some distilled water, i used to just use tap water that i boiled which i know is not the best idea. <br /><br />what would somebody recommend filter-wise? i used to just tear the tip off of a q-tip and ball it up, suck the mix through that, but i know some people aren&#039;t fans of using cotton <br /><br />thanks for the tip on the cooking, that sounds like a good plan

				I do the same for the cotton&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Cotton is fine when IVing powder. Especially High Quality Powder haha. You should order tony&#039;s pebbles or his regular H. Or wumg&#039;s H. Both are AMAZING. I tired tony&#039;s pebbles and that shit is #1 haha. I&#039;m getting a sample of wumg&#039;s very very soon since it&#039;s going to be 7 business days tomorrow and he&#039;s only from canada.<br /><br />

				hell yeah, i&#039;m glad you use cotton too, i just heard some people saying shit about cotton fever. but i&#039;m pretty sure they just use way too much cotton, you really only need enough to surround the needle with. <br /><br />you got any xperience with noriega? his prices are ridiculously low, i want to make sure its good shit, even though i&#039;ve seen rave reviews on it.<br /><br /><br />on another tangent, i just did some blow from tony76, after the only shit i ever did was cut to hell, we suspected a meth cut for a while, it was from sketch gangsters in my region. but this high quality stuff is like a whole other ball game, i&#039;m in the middle of the biggest coke rush of my life, my hands are tingling alottttttt, my legs are jttery, but my heart isn&#039;t going as fast as it has on add.adhd meds, i fucked myself up on those once, had a resting HR of 120-130 for 48 hours, had chest pains for 2 months, might have been a minor amphetamine OD. <br /><br />but anyway, i&#039;m feeling like i&#039;m fighting through a coke dose, i did .13, way too much of good shit when i&#039;ve never known what good shit is, thanks for listening you guys, i needed to vent

				Since NOr is in the netherlands, I don&#039;t order since I&#039;m in the USA. I would really need alot of spare money to try him out haha.<br /><br />But Tony&#039;s coke is bomb fosho. I was in the same position as you a couple years ago. Gangers cutting coke with ice and advil.<br /><br />Anything from tony is bomb, which is why i say order H from him. If you have the spare money you should try his pebbles. SUPER FIRE.<br /><br />

				are the pebbles the #4?<br /><br />i&#039;ve got a shipment coming from SKYY of 2gs mdma from the NL so i&#039;m gonna see how that one goes before i order again from there. i&#039;ve had success from germany with juergen, his lsd is the shit.<br /><br />i&#039;m just trying to work my way to 10 transactions so i don&#039;t have to finalize early as much :P<br /><br />luckily i came down from that coke for the most part. sucks i can&#039;t smoke cigs in my current environment, i used to devour cigs while coked out, but my all time favorite cigs was that one when you&#039;re just b4 nodding on h.<br /><br />tony is one of my new favs though.

				Haha, Yeah that cig is pretty damn amazing. Especially after shooting up :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke cig&#039;s really anymore but I feel like a pack wouldn&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />But tony is awesome. He&#039;s my #1 vendor I go to. If he had 3 gram deals though for his H, I would buy even more hhah.<br /><br />ALl powder pretty much is #4 is the US. In the EU and UK it&#039;s #3. <br /><br />

				Hey There,<br />For the easiest and BEST (in my honest opinion) heroin which is meant primarily for snorting and IVing, go with #4.<br />This is the stuff you find on the East Coast of the USA, comes from Columbia, rather than the middle east.<br />You always just cold water shoot, NO NEED FOR HEAT what so ever. That is for the other types of heroin. Trust me, I have been doing #4 for many many years, as it is all thats avaialable where I&#039;m from. Also, according to DEA statistics and other reports you can find by googling, #4 has the highest purity compared to the other numbers. I personally don&#039;t feel safe melting down any tar and putting it in my veins...I also don&#039;t feel comfotable adding any further chemicals myself over an open flame and THEN injecting it...I&#039;d rather go with a pure form of heroin that is meant to be injected by simply adding water (warm, cold, doesn&#039;t matter).<br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents and all based on my experience and thing&#039;s I&#039;ve read :)<br />I haven&#039;t checked yet, but my personal favorite is the brown/tan #4 heroin you can find in NYC. IT comes in little wax paper bags folded up, and sometimes has a plastic seal around it (known as &quot;double sealed&quot;), which the dealer puts on his bags to avoid anyone pinching, cutting, or messing with his product after it leaves his hands. Remember, these bags are stamped with a name brand or logo, this helps create a reputation for the dealer.<br /><br />So there you have it, East Coast USA (preferably New York City) no. 4 heroin....easiest and best to work with :P
