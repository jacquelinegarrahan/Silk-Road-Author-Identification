				Hello all-<br /><br />I recently acquired half a gram of meth to help as a dietary aid. I haven&#039;t been using it to get high, but rather have been taking 10mg orally in the morning around nine to help stay my appetite. It&#039;s working, as I now have to force myself to eat a little bit due to the meth completely killing my appetite.<br /><br />However, despite using only small doses, I still start getting some negative feelings about 2-3 hours in. It&#039;ll usually waver back and forth; if I relax a little, I&#039;ll feel fairly calm, but if I start moving around or doing something new the bad vibes return. It&#039;s not strong to the point that I can&#039;t cope with it (not as bad as when I was snorting amphetamine), but it&#039;s still not too pleasant.<br /><br />I do have Xanax in case I really need it but I&#039;m trying to avoid taking it as much as possible as I don&#039;t want to experience both meth and xanax withdrawal at the same time when I quit. If my meth hangover is really bad I&#039;ll start with a .5mg, if that&#039;s not enough I&#039;ll take another. Preferably, however, I would take no Xanax.<br /><br />So, I was wondering- can Modafinil (or in my case Adrafinil) help ease the hangover? Could I take some Adrafinil when I begin to feel the meth wearing off, would it help?<br /><br />Is it likely that this combination is dangerous based on their means of action, or has not enough research been done into Modafinil&#039;s pharmacology to make a conclusive statement?<br /><br />On a side note, would caffeine ease, or worsen, the meth comeoff?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />***<br />P.S, I am willingly to be a guinea pig for this, but obviously I&#039;ll only be able to report on how the Adrafinil feels after meth, as I have no means of measuring if I&#039;m damaging my brain or not. I&#039;ll only do it for a short period of time until I see more conclusive reports on the pharmacology of Modafinil.<br />***

				Here&#039;s my report, I&#039;ll edit it as time progresses. Remember, this is entirely subjective psychological feelings- it is not scientific and does not have any say in whether or not this product is safe.<br /><br />0 hours- Ingested 15mg of ChiTownMafia&#039;s Meth, started feeling pretty great, productive, and not hungry. Ingested two hours after eating a light breakfast (large coffee and a bagel) as well as a 16oz Monster Energy Drink.<br /><br />3 hours- beginning to feel the meth wear off, not feeling too well. Ingested 300mg of Adrafinil.<br /><br />4 hours- starting to feel a lot more stable; generally the meth/amphetamine come off for me is feeling a lot of warbling between feeling alright and feeling awful. With the Adrafinil, it feels a bit more stable; a more linear low-mood that all too awful.

				Interesting report.&nbsp; I have been doing the same as you w/ meth (sometimes 30mg though) and I can&#039;t quite keep myself from redosing in the evening which leads to staying up till dawn...<br />Am thinking of trying some armodafinil instead to see if its more sustainable.<br />Plus the days with no meth are becoming few and far between.&nbsp; And its typically a day of depression, lethargy, and constant hunger.&nbsp; You have to pay the piper sometime I guess.
