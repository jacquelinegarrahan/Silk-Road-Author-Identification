				Hello all,<br /><br />I am seeking some information on 2-CB. I&#039;ve heard great things about it, and am thinking about ordering from nawlins.<br /><br />The things I&#039;ve heard (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong):<br /><br />-Doesn&#039;t work like MDMA/involve serotonin receptors (can use more often than MDMA or as an alternative?)<br />-It is a combination of euphoria, moderate psychedelic, and mild stimulant<br />-Makes for a good social/party drug<br />-Comes up as amphetamine on a drug test<br /><br />Things I&#039;d like to know:<br />-Is it good for parties, possibly an alternative to alcohol or rolling?<br /><br />-How intense can the psychedelic aspect be?<br /><br />-What would a good dose for a first-time user be? (I have experience with MDMA, Acid, Cocaine, Weed, and many more)<br />I don&#039;t want to be completely out of my mind, but I would like there to be noticeable effects. Possibly want to try a light dose for the first time, then maybe a heavy one after that, if I like it.<br /><br />-Is it anything like 2-CE? ( I&#039;ve taken 2-CE before, at least that&#039;s what it was sold as, and didn&#039;t particularly care for it)<br /><br />-Is it worth trying or should I just stick to the traditional psychedelics/MDMA?<br /><br />Also, please share any experiences you have had, or might know of, regarding 2-CB, preferably obtained from the Silk Road. <br /><br />Thanks!

				You should try 2C-B. It&#039;s a great party drug and won&#039;t get you out of your mind. It&#039;s really nothing like 2C-E, so no worries there. I think 20-25 MGs would be good for a starter dose. <br />Check out Erowid.com and especially Dr. Shulgins comments on 2C-B in his book PIHKAL.

				I&#039;ll just add that I&#039;m pretty sure 2C-B (like most psyches) DOES interact with serotonin receptors. The difference is it interacts directly instead of stimulating the release of serotonin (as in it reacts with the receptors in place of serotonin.) This means you should be able to safely use more often from a physical perspective. Even though it&#039;s considered milder than Lucy or shrooms it is still a psychedelic, so you don&#039;t really want to abuse it and risk your mental health. I&#039;d limit it to once every two weeks at most, which helps avoid a build up of tolerance as well.
