				Ok, I&#039;m wondering a couple of things and I REALLY need someone who knows what they are talking about to help me out. Im considering disolving around 3g&#039;s of 2C-E into water and then splitting it into viles.<br /><br />a) What sort of water (ml) ratio to 2C (mg) ratio should i be sticking to for 12mg viles?<br /><br />b) Do i need to warm the water or add anything to help break it down? assuming it&#039;s already purified (boiled)<br /><br />and can you please add any other info you might think is neccessary. <br /><br />Cheers. Oh and just so i dont get pm&#039;s or piss any vendors off on here these viles will NOT be for SR just my mates :)<br /><br />

				Would definitely recommend a small amount of Everclear instead of water. If you use water, use distilled.<br /><br />2c-e is highly soluble in any case. If you just want to make 1-hit vials, just go for 1ml/4mg or so... That would give you a 800mL of solution from 3 grams though. It&#039;s a good balance between dosing accuracy (+/- 4mg with a mL syringe), and keeping the amount of solvent to a minimum. <br /><br />If you want more exact doses, you can go for 1ml/mg but that would be a hell of a lot of solution; if you want smaller vials, you can go to 1ml/10mg or more... Just personal preference depending on how concentrated and how closely you want to be able to measure the doses; just make sure you remember exactly which ratio you used! Write it down if necessary! <br /><br />I used to mix large batches like this, that way fairly exact doses could be measured out with a mL syringe... Then into some OJ for breakfast.<br /><br />P.S. 12mg vials seems a bit low to me.- my sweet spot was between 15-20mg, but sometimes I liked up to 25-30mg... Just something to consider when you decide how saturated to mix your solution... In general, go for the most saturated solution you can ACCURATELY measure. ;)

				ok cheers for the info, i sort of worked it out in my head myself whilst trying to sleep last night. <br /><br />Also what is everclear? <br /><br />After some investigation i&#039;m thinking 15mg doses, i originally was going 12mg so it was easier to double dose if needed be. <br /><br />What did you mix it in? I was thinking of measure the water with a syringe and mixing in a glass or round glass bowl with smooth edges so minimal 2c gets stuck to the sides. <br /><br />cheers 4 the info... :)
