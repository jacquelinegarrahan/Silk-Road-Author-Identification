				I am very experienced with high doses of lucy and recently got into molly. Love molly and the energy and love so much and also have decent visuals at high doses 300mg or so. I have read extensively and find I dont really roll off 200mg like my friends do. But anyways im going to a awsome show soon and want to know what everyones thoughts on which would be beter to dance wild out go crazy have a blast with friends. Also how do I use my reagent tests to make sure this blotter is legitimate?&nbsp; Supposedly its tasteless small Wow. Do I drop regent directly on paper? Or do I have to do an extraction and if so how? Thx for the help :)<br /><br />Happy trails and be safe everone ;)

				Def think u will be flipping. Anyone know about regent testing blotter. I have elhrich mecke and marquise can I apply regent directly to paper? Rc sketch me out and even more if flipping. Ive dodes 10 strips in the past but for recreation I usually take 2 -3 tabs. Molly 300 mg with 100mg boster at plus 1 to 2 hr. Dosing advice also plan on taking tabs then molly about 2 hrs in

				As far as testing the blotter is concerned it&#039;s a little tricky. Assuming you are using a liquid color test kit it is the liquid, not the drug that should be changing color. The issue with the blotter is that it is not necessarily consistently covered with the drug. Most people will dose the middle and the liquid will spread out towards the sides but not equally. If I was going to test paper... sadly... I would likely just drop a whole tab in there. I guess if you really wanted to try and save most of it you could fold the blotter to a triangle with the center at the top and a tiny part of the top off to drop that in and test. If it reacts you are set and if not probably drop the rest of the tab in.<br /><br />Also, if you are going for visuals and you haven&#039;t tried it before you might want to hook upo with some MDA. Much more visual than MDMA and still a similar body high. I find chasing visuals on MDMA is expensive and hard to do but on MDA I can take a more reasonable dose and still get some trippy visuals. <br /><br />If you want to try something a little different, 2CB seems to pretty cool tool. Nice body high / euphoria, little clearer head space than MDMA / MDA, and much more visual than MDMA - at 20 - 25 mg for me it&#039;s about as visual as a LARGE dose of MDA. Totally different trip than acid. LSD is often philosophical while 2CB satirical.<br />

				well the reason I ask is because last time I tripped the body load was very heavy my whole body felt like jello.and I had a hard time moving around. So the thing is I don&#039;t want to go to the show and not be able to move around because I have a heavy body load. Thank you for all the great responses. 2 CB maybe on my list of things to try but I&#039;m still a little unsure of all the 2c drugs. Mda also holds interest for me but I heard it was way more narrow toxic sometimes MDMA leaves me feeling like crap just on its own. Thanks guys ;))))

Normally when I take those I get to a really good high and then subject myself to as much brain damage as I can to hold onto it. With 2CB you can start with a nice low dose, like 5-10 mg and get a nice body high off it or go a little bigger 15-25mg and get body high and some visuals. I&#039;ve heard some crazy stuff about the 2C&#039;s before so I feel you on caution but this one is pretty nice because you can feel it out at low doses and still enjoy it.<br /><br />As far as MDA being more toxic I would say that&#039;s a little subjective, if you are cramming 300mg of MDMA to get what 150mg of MDA would get you I would argue that the MDA might actually be a little safer. I suspect you&#039;re sort of like me in that when you do it you like to be off your base quite a bit more than most and MDA gets me to the twilight zone much quicker than MDMA.<br /><br />Anyway, best of luck!

				Thx dimond. I think you might be right and mda is just what I need. I def like to be way off baseline! And I always hear good things do you like just mda or mdma mda combo? Also is mda a crystal as well? I dont see many domestic vendors stocking it but I rhink that might be on my wish list. You think 150 would get me to where 300 mdma.is? Thx for all the advice how do I give you karma ;))))

				Lots of people love the MDMA / MDA combo. Normally they dose 75% MDMA to 25% MDA - So 100mg MDMA and 50mg MDA. I&#039;ll be honest though, I chase the visuals and that just doesn&#039;t get me to where I want to be. If anything I would probably reverse that formula or just take the MDA alone. <br /><br />MDA is a little different than MDMA though in that it really holds the high quite a bit longer the more you dose. With MDMA if I take too much I get too high but return to baseline on a pretty consistent schedule. With MDA the more I take the higher I get AND the longer it keeps going. <br /><br />I&#039;d say if you are pretty comfortable with bigger doses of MDMA and the visuals / come up aren&#039;t going to put you in a bad mental place (hard on either of those drugs really). I&#039;d start with 150mg and bump from there an hour or two in. In my experience, I think thanks to the fact that it just lasts longer than MDMA, it&#039;s much easier to stay high on MDA at a pretty constant level with well timed bumps than it is with MDMA where I go up and down more between the bumps. I normally plug stuff instead of taking it orally just because it takes a little less and the bio-availability is more consistent (i.e. I don&#039;t have to worry about the burger I ate a few hours ago getting between me and my roll). As a big guy, I was well off base at 120mg plugged. <br /><br />At higher doses, I do find I get pretty shaky / sweaty and the visuals definitely get more intense. It goes from bold colors - fuzzy shapes - locked moments in time - fractal insanity as you get more and more in you.<br /><br />I normally order my MDA from ILF (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5be5f2e73a). Gets here nice and quick in the US, doesn&#039;t cost too much, and... well, he&#039;s the only one selling it. It&#039; looks like a nice light brown very fine sugar powder. Taken orally me and my GF just drop it in some water, swirl it around and slam it with a nice fruit flavored chaser of some kind.<br /><br />Hope that helps, always fun to play with new drugs and I think MDA is probably closer to the high you are looking for off X so make sure to let us know how it goes if you try it.<br /><br />Take care!<br /><br />
