				So tonight I&#039;m going to a show, planned on rolling (have a number of quality Dutch tested beans on hand, all ~200 mg). I will likely just take one, halves of a bean about 30 mins apart.<br /><br />Problem is, it&#039;s 4am now, a thunderstorm has me wide awake. I have to work (hard manual labor) from 7a-6p. It&#039;s going to be exhausting, but I&#039;ve been looking forward to this show forever!<br /><br />My question is..I&#039;ve got some top quality glass on hand, should I toot a couple of lines at lunch around noon? I plan on dropping MDMA around 10pm. Will the crystal affect my roll? I also have landing gear at my disposal, a handful of Xanax and ambien. <br /><br />Thanks for your input!

				well i have dead that when rolling that when the seratonin has run out that dopamine is excreted instead as a sort of brain backup which quickly oxidises and causes neurodamage.<br /><br />not sure how well i relayed what ive read on vrious sites.. but having loads of doamine in your brain being unable to be reupsorbed because the exit isw switched off that you could possibly have larger amounts of neurotoxic damage?<br /><br />anybody else with more knowledge may want to chime in. i think a similar thing happens when you use cocaine before a roll.. it delays the roll/kills it or some shit.

				^ yeah I figured the dopamine/seratonin receptors may be blocked by the meth in my system, rendering the MDMA less potent in terms of euphoria kick. I would really just need the crystal mid-day in a small amount and only for a little energy boost, not trying to get high

				I&#039;ve smoked meth minutes before dropping and I&#039;d say it intensified my roll...the comedown was a bit rough though but i survived...the roll was great but i was so cracked out the next day...<br /><br />you should be fine...

				ok, i managed to get off work early, didn&#039;t use any crystal, and got through the workday fine. Felt surprisingly ok!<br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve also got some amphetamine sulfate at my disposal along with the meth. The pills I&#039;ve got are fairly heavy on MDMA, and the last time I took one it was an intense roll but the cuddle puddle variety. I just wanted to lie down and feel the euphoria. Tonight I wanna be dancin more, so which of the two, meth or amph, should i do a couple lines of before I drop? I want the extra energy but don&#039;t want either to interfere with the euphoria from the MDMA. <br /><br />

By a looonnnnggggg shot. Unless you stumble upon some adderall or desoxyn, I think you have a clear winner here.

				THE VERDICT IS IN!<br /><br />I went with probably railing .2 of crystal 3 hours before i dropped. Euphoria lasted about an hour and a&nbsp; half from that, but felt pretty energetic. Then I dropped a quality dutch bean from on SR at about 11p. Took till about 12 to kick in, but i felt it. I wasn&#039;t as shaky or uneasy on the comeup. the euphoria was diminished to some point, but still plenty enjoyable. The roll duration was about cut in half. But as soon as the roll ended, the headliner was just about halfway through the set, and instead of the normal crash, it seemed like the crystal picked me right back up and i was going HARDER for the 2nd half of the set as i was the first half! It was unbelievable! I was able to power through the show as people who had dropped around the same time i did dropped like dead flies......<br /><br />flawless victory.<br />
