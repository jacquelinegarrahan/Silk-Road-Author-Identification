				Lets say you&#039;re partaking in a substance with a low active dose, and you&#039;re consuming it through insufflation. For example, china white on a low tolerance.<br /><br />You are experienced with its effects and its dosage, but without a milligram scale it&#039;s very hard to accurately measure out insufflated doses. However, that&#039;s not stopping you. You line up what looks like a decent dose. Perhaps a tad large, but it doesn&#039;t seem dangerous.<br /><br />You rail it, and start to feel its effects very quickly. After 3 minutes, you&#039;re already right where you want to be. Except for one thing: it takes 15-20 minutes to kick in. Uh oh, if this is how you feel now, how are you going to feel when it&#039;s fully kicked in? Not good, that&#039;s for sure. The little pile must have been more than it looked like. <br /><br />In this situation, does anyone know enough about the mucus membrane and nasal absorption to know whether immediately flushing out your nasal cavity with water could flush out the unwanted drug before it&#039;s absorbed into the bloodstream? It would make sense to me, but I have a poor understanding of biology. Has anyone here overdosed intranasally before? If so, did you feel it coming up too quickly, and did you know you were in for something unpleasant? Did you take any measures like this to stop the overdose?

				I&#039;d think it would be marginally effective, you would probably wash some of the drug into the stomach and if I&#039;m correct heroin has a very low oral bioavailability.&nbsp; In the scenario you outline I think the drug trapped in the mucous that has yet to act might be enough to fuck you plus the swallowed irrigation saline/water would be a time bomb with a slower onset than intranasal.&nbsp; I&#039;m not shooting the idea down, any action is better than no action, maybe irrigation with nose blowing first and during would be slightly better.&nbsp; Just thoughts not a scientific reply or educated thesis.
