				im not talking about the comedown or feeling shitty during your trip.<br /><br />after a weekend of fun, do you ever find yourself saying &quot;well.. maybe i shouldnt have done that..&quot;<br /><br />im asking because i take drugs usually every weekend, in very small amounts usually, line of coke, some methylone, MDMA every couple months, trip with 2cb or smoke some DMT, some ketamine now and then..<br /><br />im very non addictive and could go without taking anything whenever i wanted, but i usually take something on fri, sometimes saturday night.<br /><br />i dont know if its the general stigma of drug use or what.. but its kinda not as fun as it used to be.. i dont like looking back on the weekend with any bad thoughts.. maybe im growing up... <br /><br />does anyone else think this way??

				Yea, dude, that&#039;s how drugs work. You get high, you come down, and then your brain chemistry takes a while after that to get back to normal.<br /><br />I get the feeling that the more often you take drugs, the more likely you are to think that perhaps you&#039;re taking them too often. I personally always found my favorite part of drug experiences to be the novelty. If you think that&#039;s what it was for you, you can keep exploring drugs as experiences, or you can broaden your horizons and explore other experiences.<br /><br />I personally would suggest the second one. I kinda cycle in and out of doing drugs regularly, to try to keep the novelty there. For a while I try Ketamine, Heroin, Methamphetamine, 2C-G-5, Butylone, and Mescaline (among others), and then I take a while without them to try and find new ways to experience.<br /><br />I&#039;d say you should avoid the assumption that the weekend means drug use. The weekend is certainly an opportunity to take drugs, but there are so many other things you could do with your weekend as well. Think of it as an exploration; I think you&#039;ll enjoy it.

				I have been in the midst of making a long move and change of lifestyle very soon.&nbsp; And sometimes I catch myself thinking &#039;damn when i make this move am I going to have to stop all this to restart life&quot; and then i get down on it a little.&nbsp; I think its honestly just this scared stigma society has that everyone who does drugs is this crazy monster and can&#039;t participate in society properly.&nbsp; While some people are like that, Ive found most are not, but still we are brought up with these notions and its hard to break them.&nbsp; Although I think you need to keep some of the old feelings cause its a dangerous game we play.&nbsp; Things can quickly get out of hand and life can sneak up on you, but i think the sadness/down feeling is just guilt learned through our lives&nbsp;

				I usually feel like shit after some drugs. Though there&#039;s drugs which don&#039;t give me a comedown either.<br />Like weed.

				The only time I regret it is when I have to do things the next day and find my ability is reduced from the night before. That is the real sign that its a problem, and always a quick wake up to back off in general and be more patient with when I can have experiences.<br /><br />Though once after a dose of LSD around 400ug, I was feeling very weird all day the next day and started to wonder if I would ever feel normal again, then I regretted taking the high dose. But 2 days after when I looked back on it feeling fine, I didn&#039;t regret it anymore.

				by the way - even though i only did Mandy once every 6 months or so i still got BAD suicidal depression with it, last time i got like that i actually told myself - NO MORE, the downside far outweighs the upside so i&#039;m not doing it any more - it&#039;s just not worth it.<br /><br />still fine with E&#039;s though. weird eh?

				thanks for replies guys, its always good relate to some others on an issue<br /><br />just to be clear: im NOT talking about the comedown symptoms after taking a drug, im talking more about the AFTER comedown phase, just reflecting on your actions<br /><br />i got seriously close to major LE trouble with molly last year and after that my perspective is different i think, its not quite as fun any more, i find myself being very critical on my actions, and its made it hard to have a good LSD trip, its dark quick and i cant just &quot;let go&quot;... <br /><br />i didnt get in trouble tho and im non addictive to a point where i have no doubt i will ever get in over my head..<br /><br />so i wish i could just kick the negative thoughts. after all i was saved by MDMA, it litterally turned my life around and made me happy, and LSD has given me a truly religious experience that il never forget...

Society wants drug users to feel bad about their drug use and to feel guilty and as a result they work hard so drug users will feel bad. With that being said the drugs themselves can contribute to feeling bad once you are out or while you are sober.

				Have you ever attempted living straight edge for a while? Literally, just don&#039;t take any drug for a month and see what comes of it. The first few days or even weeks can be...well difficult, not necessarily hard to do but not altogether pleasant either. Challenge yourself &#039;One more day&#039; and it becomes remarkably easier. Taking a few clean breaks like this a year has done amazing things to my mood and overall my life. Besides, drugs will always be there when you return from sobriety, so what do you have to lose other than a weekend of fun? :)

The overblown and disproportionate stigma that modern society places on drug use is hard to shake, even if you&#039;re a responsible user who practices harm reduction. There have been many times where immediately after the comedown from a high I beat myself up for doing something that is so widely regarded as being &quot;wrong.&quot; I say to myself, &quot;what would your mom/dad/sister say if they knew what you did last night?&quot; But reflecting upon it later on, I really have no regrets when it comes to my drug use. I haven&#039;t hurt myself or anyone else, and we only get one life - using drugs enhances my experiences and makes life more interesting and enjoyable. What&#039;s wrong with that? Don&#039;t be so tough on yourself. Dedicate yourself to using responsibly and savor your drug experiences :)

				I&#039;ve never gotten depressed after drug use. But then again when it comes to drugs everybody is different. I normally get the &#039;afterglow&#039; from MDMA. 2c-b seemed to have gave me an afterglow as well. I understand what people mean about the guilty feeling though. I use to get that just from smoking a little bit of weed in my parents house when I was younger. <br /><br />I live on my own, and a lot of my friends indulge in a lot of the things I do. Damn, only the other week I introduced one of my friends to MDMA, he loved it! For days he was going on about it, sometimes I felt high even listening to him! The feeling of giving someone else that kind of experience is honestly amazing! Honestly, try and avoid doing drugs in the presence of someone who is unaware. The guilt creeps up, and sometimes you can feel depressed from the overwhelming guilt... and the feeling you&#039;re nothing but &#039;scum&#039; and a liar etc... Also remember a lot of these things will be more tolerated in the future, if not then our governments are more ignorant than I thought!<br /><br />My advice for someone who gets depressed after drug use is to keep in contact with the people who did it with you... Even if you&#039;re someone who inevitably gets depressed after the experience. Keeping yourself busy and talking to others in the same situation will help.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sollemnis
