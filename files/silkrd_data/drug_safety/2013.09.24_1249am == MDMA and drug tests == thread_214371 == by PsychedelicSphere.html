				Hi guys, I have a few questions. I am new to MDMA, never tried it, but I would really like to.<br /><br />I know that MDMA isn&#039;t going to show up on any basic Urine Analysis or Hair test that I will take for work. I&#039;ve heard my friends tell me stories about getting shit cut with meth and all this stuff... Would I be safe, drug test wise, taking MDMA bought from the road? My drug screens on test for thc, cocaine, and methamphetamine&#039;s. <br /><br />Another question I have.... <br /><br />Any reason why I shouldn&#039;t take MDMA the next day after an acid trip? I understand my serotonin levels will be fucked up. This will just be a one time thing for a music fest.... Errr, I think hahah. Will I have to take more than an average dose of MDMA? If I take the MDMA the day before the LSD I shouldn&#039;t have to up the dose should I? Should I take some serotonin pills to help keep my levels somewhat normal, or just say fuck it since it&#039;s only for a weekend. <br /><br />Thanks for the help<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				I&#039;ve heard an argument for taking MDMA before LSD, but can&#039;t remember the neuroscience behind it. Look forward to a reply to this q<br /><br />I would take seratonin and vit C

				Well I was doing some research and I found some unsettling news.<br /><br />Per Erowid<br /><br />&quot;MDMA is detectable with hair tests and there are at least two drug testing companies (Psychemedics and Quest Diagnostics) which include it in their standard hair test.&quot;<br /><br />Psychemedics and Quest happen to be two lab partners of DISA Global Solutions. The company I work for uses DISA so it looks like MDMA is a no go for me :(<br /><br />My buddy at work says they usually do the annual hair test around December - January and the music fest I am going to is November 1st - 3rd. I don&#039;t think I should risk it. I&#039;ll just have to wait until I quit this job and go back to school until I can try it. Well this blows. <br /><br />Looks like I will just be dropping acid two days in a row hahah. <br /><br />~Psychedelic
