				I recommend you go for LSD (first choice) or Shrooms (second choice). Just start with a low dose and it shouldn&#039;t be too intense.

				LSD or Shrooms is 100% the way to go. I wouldn&#039;t put to much trust in resaerech chemicals they are under researched and can potentially produce unwanted effects. If you really want to trip and see what a real psychedelic is like take 2 tabs of LSD. Shrooms are also amazing and create a alot of introspection. I recommend with your 50 dollars you buy both if the LSD venders ever fix their horrible prices.

				I have removed LSD from my list, as it&#039;s no longer an option sadly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there are any established domestic acid vendors within my price range.&nbsp; Oh, I&#039;ll definitely stay away from DOx chemicals, and the really intense 2Cs.&nbsp; <br /><br />After just reading a lot more on 2C-I, some say it&#039;s a waste of time and not all that great.&nbsp; Anyone have any personal experience with 2C-I?&nbsp; If I&#039;m after good visuals, sensory enhancement, and introspection/awakening, would 2C-E be a better choice?&nbsp; If I start small, is 2C-E too intense for a first-time tripper?

				Shrooms or DMT. All psychedelics have a Spiritual essence one simply&nbsp; has to know how to unravel, but DMT isn&#039;t called the Spirit Molecule for kicks. The OEVs and CEVs are pretty much unmatched, and the rest of the hyperspace experience is not describable since language is a barrier for such a thing. Even if it is a little expensive, the DMT experience can easily be one of the most profound realizations, if you can call it that, one has in his own life.<br /><br />Shrooms are great for a first timer. My first time was with a half 8th of shrooms, and I got blasted off on that little amount. No CEVs, but tons and tons of OEVs. Fractals and patterns rotating on the carpet, kids who look like their wearing fluorescent rainbow jumpsuits, contrasts flip to opposites, and a very Spiritual and Enlightening feeling if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for. Just make yourself a lemon shot if you don&#039;t want to wait for the come-up.<br /><br />So far in my experience, I haven&#039;t gotten a particularly mind blowing batch of LSD, but you said it&#039;s out of your price range, so I can&#039;t really comment on it.

				I did 2.5 gs of his shrooms on friday. Really fun time but if you want a more powerful trip your gonna want about 7-8 pills. But since you said this is your first 5 pills will be very enjoyable and last you around 4 hours with about 1.5 hours of nice visuals (not extremely powerful but nice).

				I haven&#039;t experimented with RC&#039;s, but I&#039;d recommend LSD, mushrooms, or starting with a low dose of DMT.<br /><br />Mushrooms are great, but I find LSD better for a &quot;fun&quot; time. Mushrooms can be pretty raw and get very introspective at effective doses. 2.5g of mushrooms alone will be a decent trip I&#039;m sure (you&#039;re eating mushrooms after all) but the real magic for me comes at 3g+ so I usually just eat a full 8th. Do not eat more than 4g until you are experienced however.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend LSD (if you can find one in your price range) if you want to be more active and functional during the trip. If you are a little weary I&#039;d say drop 2 tabs (200ug+) and you won&#039;t be overwhelmed at all. A single tab, much like &lt;3g mushrooms, won&#039;t provide me much for visuals other than some slight weirdness to everything. Mental effects are there, though a bit weak as well on one tab.<br /><br />And my personal favorite... DMT. Since you mentioned you don&#039;t want to be overwhelmed I&#039;d recommend some of DiMiTriSpice&#039;s Changa. It is a mix of DMT with an MAOI containing plant. This basically allows for the DMT trip to come on slower and last longer, making it much easier to manage in the low-dose setting. Pack 50-100mg in a bowl, light it up, hold it in, and you&#039;ll essentially be on a 20-30 minute low-dose mushroom or LSD trip. When coming down from the short trip you can simply re-dose to extend the trip. If you want to trip a little harder just smoke a little more before coming down. If you decide tripping is fantastic and want a breakthrough you will not be disappointed. Take a good rip 3-4 times, hold in each one fully for 15-20 seconds and enter the world of love and spirits.<br /><br />If you prefer to take it slow you can always work your way up the ladder with any of these substances. Low doses are nice for putting your mind at ease with a substance. Once you know in your mind that you will be OK and whatever is happening is all in your head and just a part of the trip then higher doses will only amplify the amount of fun and enlightenment.<br /><br />Best of luck and happy tripping friend.

				Check out my thread &quot;first timer mushroom trip&quot;. I had an amazing life changing deep spiritual trip and then the next day I took too many and had the craziest night of my life. From my two experiences I recommend a comfortable safe setting and taking a dose that isn&#039;t too crazy.

				Have fun man. I started a few years ago with a shroom dose after being basically a straight edge kid for 20 years. Definitely changed my life for the better and helped me see things for other peoples&#039; perspectives. From there on out it&#039;s been a journey into my mind and whatever else is out there. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

				OMG.&nbsp; I took 5 caps of Galindoi&#039;s product Thursday night.&nbsp; The come up took about 45 minutes to an hour.&nbsp; I started peaking within an hour and a half.&nbsp; I was with friends and we were watching this movie called Spork.&nbsp; It was perfect with the shrooms.&nbsp; So over the top.&nbsp; So cartoony and vivid.&nbsp; And I went into bouts of uncontrollable laughter.&nbsp; And I felt like I was IN the movie at certain parts.&nbsp; The body high from these shrooms was amazing.&nbsp; For awhile I kept thinking I had come in my pants; it was like my whole body was tingling, even my cock, and it was just these waves of orgasmic pleasure.&nbsp; Once I stood up, I realized I was really tripping.&nbsp; I think I only got to a Level 2 trip.<br /><br />Everything looked so panoramic, and I kept staring at chairs and paintings.&nbsp; Music was great, and I danced quite a bit.&nbsp; It reminded me of MDMA, because I had a lot of energy and was just so happy.&nbsp; It was trippier, though, and not as euphoric, obviously.&nbsp; I had so much fun just looking in the mirror.&nbsp; My pupils were fucking huge, and I looked like a ridiculous, maniacal cartoon character.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have any CEVs or OEVs, but everything was enhanced in a way I had never experienced before.&nbsp; I felt like I could really notice that everything in life is 3D.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t explain it to friends at all, but I remember I just kept saying, &quot;everything has so much extra volume.&quot;&nbsp; I had tracers and when I looked at pictures, I swore they were morphing slightly, and I was convinced they were moving.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 2.5 grams only lasted 2.5-3.5 hours, and this is counting the come up and peak.&nbsp; After effects lasted about an hour or so. Not sure if that&#039;s normal or not.&nbsp; I swallowed the 5 caps at 9, and I could tell there was steep decline at around 11:45.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am still very satisfied with this experience.&nbsp; Galindoi is an AMAZING vendor.&nbsp; He treats you like a good friend.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m gonna order 50 caps soon.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; His packaging blew me away.&nbsp; My only concern was the envelope had been torn for inspection, but his packaging is so flawless, it showed up anyway.&nbsp; Is it safe to order again, though, if they&#039;ve inspected it before?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had 4 other packages and none of them were ever ripped open, but maybe that&#039;s because they were in plain letters.<br /><br />How long should one wait between trips?&nbsp; I REALLY want to take the other 7 caps (3.5 grams) and FULLY trip tonight.&nbsp; It&#039;s St. Patrick&#039;s Day and I don&#039;t feel up to imbibing.&nbsp; But it&#039;s only been two days since I took them the first time.&nbsp; Thoughts?<br /><br />NOTE: I took a key bump and a small line of MXE that day, so maybe this is to blame for shorter duration and possibly diminished effects?<br /><br />

				You should wait at least a week between your mushroom trips because your tolerance builds up very quickly.<br />I&#039;d give it 10 days for better effects.<br /><br />Try tripping outdoors in nature.<br />And prepare some psychedelic tracklists to listen to while peaking.<br /><br />Some recommendations:<br />- Shpongle, start with &quot;Are you shpongled?&quot;<br />- 1200 micrograms<br />- Entheogenic<br />- Hallucinogen: Twisted and The Lone Deranger <br />- Pink floyd <br />- The doors<br /><br />Have fun

				hey happyroller listen to atlas and wait it out. It&#039;ll be worth the wait...your tolerance for shrooms doubles within a few hours of ingesting them but will go back down after about a week.&nbsp; As for music...try some phish, dead, or jerry garcia band...soooo good...I believe im the one who introduced you to shpongle i think something like shpongle or Ott is more appropriate for some deemsters but just opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me know how the trip goes with the higher dosage...sounds like some bomb booms tho from what you described.
