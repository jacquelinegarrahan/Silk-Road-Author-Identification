				My friends have done it before but they don&#039;t know about SR so I&#039;m thinking I might just buy a gram and put their shit street MDMA to shame. How do I take it, I heard you just swallow it in a rizla? Is there a specific way to do it, and how much should I take to start. Please bare in mind I&#039;m a regular bud smoker but never done anything else.

				1. Be aware of any medical conditions and medication your friends might be taking. MAOIs should never be mixed with any mono amine-drugs. Tramadol is a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; drug and taking MDMA while on it can lead into severe medical problems and even death. SSRI medication + MDMA is something that could be debated on more. Some say it&#039;s safe, some say it&#039;s not. Again, probably depends on what SSRI you are specifically taking.<br />This really should not be a problem though, since you said that your friends are experienced with MDMA already.<br /><br />2. Weigh out the desired amount of material<br /><br />3. Make a rizla bomb or what ever floats your boat (buy gelatin capsules?) and drink down with a glass of water<br /><br />4. Have fun<br /><br />5. If in a hot environment, drink 0.5 liters of liquids per hour if sweating - DO NOT OVERDRINK! People actually often times drink too much and end up in a serious condition as MDMA is antidiuretic and will cause a piss-lock-up. This can really strain your kidneys.<br /><br />6. If unsure of anything, consult bluelight.ru. You can find everything there.<br /><br /><br /><br />Some urban legends which might have some sort of factual background to them, but I can&#039;t say for sure. <br />1. MDMA should not be consumed with a highly acidic drink such as a juice from a citrus genus plant ie. orange juice, lemon juice. Same goes for soft drinks. - I have never experienced lowered effects from swallowing MDMA down with a glass of coca cola though.<br /><br />2. MDMA is an amphetamine and amphetamines absorb better in alkaline environments in the gastric system (this is TRUE). Alkalizing your urine before hand may therefore produce greater effects. (There were/are some talks about this in bluelight and some people said it actually works) - Urine can be alkalized by taking a glass of water and simply putting a small spoonful of baking soda into it and drinking it. Won&#039;t kill you, but keep in mind that taking too much can really fuck up your blood&#039;s plasma levels. <br /><br />MDMA can be taken in almost any given way. Orally, intranasally, shooting up your vein (shit that sounds so nasty hhhrrrr) and even plugging it up your bum hole. <br /><br />I have only once in my life snorted a small line of MDMA, which I really thought was a stupid waste afterwards. I highly recommend to take MDMA orally. The bum hole administration method is nice also I&#039;ve from what I&#039;ve heard (really not that messy either).

				If you&#039;re on an SSRI just skip the dose on the day you&#039;re going to take the MDMA. If you&#039;re taking molly/powder MDMA, Try putting 125mg in a capsule. If you don&#039;t have a capsule. crush up the powder (It doesn&#039;t have to be finely crushed, just crush it if you got the big rocks), lick your finger and stick it in the bag, then put the finger in your mouth and swallow that. I&#039;ve seen this girl do that on a documentary from Amsterdam and it seemed to have worked and be the right dose. Not too little or not too much. But if you can weight it, for first time, around 125mg seems to be a right dose. If body weight is on the plus side, Maybe add 10 or 15mg.

				125mg orally I just parachute it put it in tissue paper and swallow it. Then when u stsrt to feel ur hands sweat and eyes dialate drop another 50-75. It&#039;ll give u two peaks and really prolong it. <br /><br />I personnlly have a connection to snorting molly. I wouldn&#039;t recomend it. But it turns into a whole nother drug. Idk I enjoy the familiar feeling and burn. The drip bothered me at first like I was going to puke but now I kinda like the taste because I know in 5 mins I&#039;m going to have a complete bodyy orgasm. <br /><br />I&#039;d actually recommend getting rolls/ molly pills. They seem to be a easy way to dose and thier are a lot of good ones out there. Do ur research and stay safe. Try not to do it to often or too much or ull lose the magic.don&#039;t ever exeed 200mgs it just increases side effects. Not a good feeling. I ended up snorting 350mgs one night then a week later ate 150 and snorted 300 mgs. Nedless to say by the last couple of lines it wasn&#039;t doing anything else. I&#039;m probly going to wait6months before I do mdma again. But I do have some methylone I may try next month still debating tho. <br /><br />Have fun!!!

Some gelatine caps can take very long to break down so I wouldn&#039;t recommend that.<br /><br />About your urban legends, an acidic urine makes amphetamine leave your body faster and decreases its bioavailability and an alkaline one potentiates it like you said. I don&#039;t know if it works exactly the same way with MDMA or to the same extent but I think it shouldn&#039;t be consumed with acidic drinks because it may make it weaker. It definitely works with amphetamine though, I often take a couple aspirins and lemon juice to come down when on speed.

				Take orally 2mg/kg (rizla or gel capsule)<br />Wait 30 minutes<br />Have Lot of Fun! :D / play with water and ice, hug someone, listen to music, lot more just search<br />If you want take a redose 1/3 of the first dose after 1 hour, don&#039;t wait more or the redose effect will be too mild<br />Drink enough, especially if you are in hot place and sweat a lot.<br />Have Lot of Fun! :D already said?
