				As you said, it enhances the experience for some people and ruins it for others. There is no way of predicting how it will affect you.

				I find that doing coke after mdma kills my roll, but not before. I like to do some lines with a few drinks early in the evening, and about an hour after my last line (which is usually when I&#039;m wanting more coke!) I will take the mdma. It takes a little longer to come up than normal, but when it hits, it&#039;s still great as ever.

				cocaine inhibits the reuptake of dopamine...cocaine also has a half life of about 1 hour...<br /><br />if you do coke at least 2 hours before your roll it shouldn&#039;t affect it much...<br /><br />if you do coke while rolling the DRI effect will have an impact on the euphoria of of your roll...

				I did coke one time towards the end of my roll, I was still rolling strong and as soon as I did the coke the roll was over ;( also didnt feel the effects of the coke as I normally would almost just felt sober. Also went on a oxy binge for a week before rolling and I took my normal dose with tried and true gear and barely rolled at all, I only roll every few months so from now on I dont do anything other than smoke bud for a week before the roll out of fear it will kill my roll, thats just me though, be safe and have fun!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />ps I also read mixing the 2 is realy bad for your body heart so I would just stick to one or the other

The cocaethylene also starts using up your serotonin. <br /><br />Think of serotonin as the fuel for your MDMA. Without it, the MDMA has no euphoria. So doing this before your roll isn&#039;t ideal. In fact, drinking alcohol before your roll is even worse. If you really want to have a good roll, take MDMA will you are completely straight and well rested. <br /><br />Then later in the night, switch to cocaine (and alcohol if you want) which you can continue to re-dose and get excessively more wasted.. but yeh you can kiss your roll goodbye.&nbsp;

				Have a little line or two an hour or two or three before you drop the xtc.<br /><br />Then come up and enjoy the roll. Then take another xtc hit and roll some more.<br /><br />Then when the xtc buzz starts to fade you will be very pleased that you kept your coke.<br /><br />So now just sniff coke and drink beer and smoke lots of weed and do lots of ketamine and you will be a happy larry.<br /><br />Then it will be morning and you will have had an e&#039;d up, coked&#039;d up, damn good time!

				Coke will kill your roll.&nbsp; Coke and GHB is alot of fun.&nbsp; Either do the coke before....or save the coke for when you are done rolling.
