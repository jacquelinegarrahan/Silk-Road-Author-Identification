				Apparently some bad ecstasy going around some parts of Canada but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what killed this kid.&nbsp; &nbsp;5 people dead since August.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was from the vancouver sun today.<br />Never heard of PMMA but I&#039;m not a big roller.&nbsp; Be safe my e friends.<br /><br />******************************************************<br />The B.C. Coroners Service has confirmed that a 16-year-old Langley boy who died last month had ecstasy, as well as an over-the-counter antihistamine, in his system.<br /><br />There was no trace of paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), the adulterant added to ecstasy believed to have killed at least 13 people in B.C. and Alberta recently.<br /><br />The teen, along with several friends, took the ecstasy on the night of Jan. 14, according to the coroner. Early the next day, the others heard him collapse and called 911.<br /><br />Paramedics transported the teen to Langley Memorial Hospital; however, he could not be revived.<br /><br />The pharmaceutical found in his system, diphenhydramine, is commonly marketed under the name Benadryl.<br /><br />Barbara McLintock, a spokeswoman for the coroners service, said the agency is still quantifying the amount of each drug in the teen’s system.<br /><br />Until those results are available, “how related [the death] was to the ecstasy, we don’t quite know yet,” she said.<br /><br />Five British Columbians, ranging in age from 14 to 37, have died from PMMA-tainted ecstasy since August, according to chief coroner Lisa Lapointe.<br /><br />Eight people in Alberta have also died with the drug in their system since late last year.<br /><br />PMMA is about five times more toxic than MDMA, or pure ecstasy Because of its slower onset, many users take more pills — and end up with much more significant overdoses, said Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.’s provincial health officer.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.vancouversun.com/Langley+teen+combined+ecstasy+antihistamine+before+died/6081374/story.html#ixzz1l6DDCdyC<br /><br />

				This is really why I love SR so much, you can be relatively confident that what you are ordering is what the vendor says it is due to the feedback system.

Maybe one day. :( The annoying thing is that most people who&#039;re uneducated in the drug field will look at reports like this and assume that it is another reason why MDMA shouldn&#039;t be legalized when in fact legalizing MDMA would lead to a happier, better world with so much less drug crime.<br /><br />Silk Road is just a glimpse into the possibilities and reality of ending prohibition.

To me it feels like a proving ground of full legalization. With lots of great, somewhat safe and non addictive drugs, why would I want to bother with heroin or crystal meth? Having a fully available product range means users can make safer choices, if they so desire. I&#039;m sure there are people who don&#039;t mind being addicted to H, as long as they can keep getting it.
