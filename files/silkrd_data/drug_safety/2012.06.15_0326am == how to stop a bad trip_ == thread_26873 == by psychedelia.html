				I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, but the most helpful thing is to remind yourself that you&#039;re only tripping and it will all end eventually (the trip, that is..).<br /><br />You may want to try changing your setting once in a while. Try sitting outside one evening, or tripping with a friend. <br /><br />sdesu

Preparing myself beforehand that there&#039;s a very real possibility things could turn sour at any moment but knowing without a doubt in my mind that I&#039;ll be fine in the end is how I work myself through them. My point of view about bad trips is that they build character, so even the worst is never that bad in the grand scheme of things.

				I like taking .5mg of xanax right before I start tripping, it just takes the edge off but doesn&#039;t kill my trip at all. You could also take MDMA (100mg) and it will take the &quot;what the fuck&quot; aspect out of the psychedelic which really helps me out personally when I do shrooms.

				Milk, suprisingly, helps alot.<br /><br />I have only had one &quot;bad&quot; trip. I can&#039;t really call it bad though, because I have a funny ass story from it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to go into it all, but I was all alone, and totally forgot I was tripping. I didn&#039;t know WTF, hell I didn&#039;t know anything. It was like I had just been born for awhile.<br /><br />There was one point where I was out in the woods all alone at 3am doing jumping jacks as hard as I could. My heart was racing, I could hear it. I decided that I needed to exercise, so my body would keep up with my heart rate. lol. I thought I would die if I didn&#039;t. I was even calling out &quot;one, two, three, four&quot; as I did jumping jacks.<br /><br />I would have driven myself to the hospital, but (thank god) I decided I&#039;d die before I got there.<br />

				I had a bad shroom trip one night. I didnt even want to trip but gave in to some peer pressure (what a bitch i know). Anyway the trip came on heavy and i felt out of place. Started going down the bad trip road, so I grabbed the six pack i had brought with me to my buddys house and started chugging. I put down six beers in less than 6 minutes. It totally stopped the bad trip, only now i was drunk AND tripping balls. My buddy saw i was fucked up and sent me on a mission to rack up a game a pool. It took me almost a half hour to locate all the pool balls (they were in their respectful pockets) and rack up the game. I had an awesome night btw. The booze and the fact that I had a purpose (setting up the pool table) took my mind off the bad trip and completely turned it around. <br />

				I&#039;ve been an avid psychonaut and from my experience, some of the best trips I&#039;ve ever had started off horribly wrong. <br />Just chillax and ride the wave. Mixing other Rx certainly takes the edge of and tunes out the demons. Distract your senses with something you enjoy... like music or TV. Psilocybin is harmless. Just remind yourself that when you get lost.

				Sugar helps. So drink or eat something with lots of sugar in it. This will not take the trip away, but it will make the trip a bit less intense.

				The BEST help is someone to comfort that person having a bad trip.<br /><br />Easier for women as they can connect emotionally - whilst guys and especially younger guys might struggle if a mate hugged you for example.<br /><br />I have babysat several people on bad trips. One was a women I had just met - so i had to gain trust without coming across like some guy hitting on her. Being narried that is not going to happen or Mrs Red would chop my you know what off. So she says. Think she means it!<br /><br />So contact with some - a friend, can stop some real bad shit happening.<br /><br />We always have someone sober when using hallucinogenics. <br /><br />A few Valium would not do any damage. 10mg perhaps 20mg. Less if they have never had a benzo. <br /><br />But the benzo takes time to kick in and they need some loving care. Don&#039;t be afraid to show love to friends. I mean platonic - caring love - not that &#039;get your dick out&#039; shit. <br /><br />Actually - if you have a close relationship with someone sex might do the trick. Take your mind off whatever. But never take advantage - most women on a bad trip want a few hugs is all. <br /><br />Good luck people and stay safe.

I used acid, zoomers, and pot all through middle and high school, and quit all of them a few years after graduation. I was in business for for all of it, so when I say used, It was literally constant. That was years ago, and I still cannot use that family of drugs. The paranoia and anxiety is overwhelming. <br /><br />That being said, I still love my cocaine, MDMA, benzos, and occasionally H&nbsp; ;D.

				Benzos are pretty standard, although I believe if you decide to trip you should decide to accept the whole experience. Still though, for those freakin out, nothing wrong with 1mg of xanax. I&#039;ve found that a big LSD trip cant really be stopped, just re-guided. For shrooms and smaller LSD trips, nothing better than booze. Seriously, I find this is so under appreciated by people. Just grab a six pack or a bottle and all your fear will be gone.

				At some of our local festivals the SafeStock tent is usually equipped with soft beds, quiet ambient music and lighting. Usually there is a girl or two who take shifts going bed to bed taking care of people and reading short stories and supplying milk regiments (Not from their bewbs) most of the people usually calm down there and get re centered.<br /><br />There have been a few cases of people extremely disassociated from reality although (acid+shroom+mescaline trifecta)&nbsp; and for the safety of the volunteers and the rest of the people in there they can&#039;t be administered into the tent. Sadly, those people are on their own or in the care of good friends, hopefully. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had two bad trips which, to this day, still have resounding effects on my apprehension of taking psychedelics. It is very hard to take the dive knowing the possibility is easily real.

				I&#039;ve had some very bad trips lately...<br /><br />Not yet found anything that will completely solve it. I do find eating/drinking sweet things helps as its sometimes due to low blood sugar, also drink plenty of water. Watching simple fun tv shows also helps. I like American Dad, Family Guy, Two and a Half Men (old stuff not the new crap!) among others, but whatever you usually like watching. Also change your lighting. Smoke a little weed, not a lot though, and breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.<br />Having someone close to you to talk to will help too.

				I read what you said.<br /><br />Oranges contain Vitamin C, so I never would have thought to use them to stop a trip. If oranges help bring down a trip because of other naturally occurring compounds or some other shit thats cool and good to know, but prior to reading your post ive only heard of vitamin c boosting a trip. Will have to give it a try if i ever go down that road again.

				Nice tip about fresh orange, makes you crash back to earth in a few secs?&nbsp; Sounds great but let ya know some trippers plan to get a BREAKTHROUGH from their trips and pulling a calm down would be a waste for them. However it will be great if one wish to discontinue the bad trip.<br /><br />You should know experienced shroomers wants to feel some nausea (apparently same as some H chippers). The more nausea they feel the more insightful and stronger the trip will be and their stomachs are &#039;cleansed&#039;.

				I believe it is the opposite.<br /><br />The acidity of vitamin C in oranges would react with Psilocin (an alkaloid) which would form a salt, enabling quicker absorption into the bloodstream. <br /><br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				Fresh fruit is always included in my arsenal when tripping, oranges and grapefruit especially. I have never had a fresh orange diminish my trip whatsoever. Maybe I need to juice it first?&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I have heard that one of the reasons that Vit C is good is because it helps resupply your adrenal glands. Maybe fresh OJ helped your bad trip because your adrenals were exhausted?<br /><br />I am sticking to my guns, the best thing to help a bad trip, aside from changing set and setting, is benzodiazepines.

				You guys scare me and I&#039;m not even in medical field. Someone&#039;s badly tripping (probably taken too much of drug X), so you&#039;re suggesting to take drug Y? Hello, interactions (potentially deadly)? May taking drug Y make the situation even worse? For example, drug X causes high blood pressure and drug Y does too, then what?<br /><br />OP, and anyone who&#039;s reading - changing setting, reassuring yourself, or having someone reassure you - helps ease bad trips. Knowing how drug works and knowing potential bad symptoms ahead of time helps too. In other words, be prepared, and don&#039;t bombard your brain with even more drugs when it&#039;s already in distress.

This reference doesn&#039;t even mention that benzos lower body temperature, which could be dangerously high in the case of too much MDMA or other stimulants.<br /><br />I do see your point though. Someone having a bad trip who is also on a high dose of alcohol, opiates or other strong sedative should NOT take benzos and should probably send for a bushel of fresh oranges and juicer ;D<br /><br />Otherwise, benzos seem to be pretty safe with psychedelics.
