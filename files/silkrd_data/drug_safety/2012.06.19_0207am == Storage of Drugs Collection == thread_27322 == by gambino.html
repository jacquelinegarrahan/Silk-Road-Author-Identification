				Mostly psychedelics, some stims, white powders and crystals and such.&nbsp; <br /><br />Would you keep them in a safe, a lock box, top drawer, or something else?&nbsp; I want to keep curious people out, something that&#039;s convenient to access and relatively inconspicuous.&nbsp; Currently there are just vacuum sealed and tossed in a backpack.&nbsp; So I&#039;m looking for something a little better.&nbsp; Was hoping to hear ideas about what others do.&nbsp; This is my personal stash, not talking commercial here.

				mason jars and a safe thats either immovable or secured to something immovable. keys or combinations that are more than 3 #s. Get a safe with hinges on the inside and a bike lock can be used to secure the safe to something like a post. easy to access, explainable enough, and hard to break into, take or smell

				I know it is a bit cliché, but I am currently in the market for a lockable briefcase, Fear and Loathing style. Easily portable, plenty of space inside, and if it is locked, I believe LE needs a specific warrant to get inside it.<br /><br />And Dondada, how I wish I could see your acid museum! How does the Sandoz compare to today&#039;s stuff?<br /><br />

Or just vacuum seal your items and place them in mason jars. (I think they now make mason jars that come with a lid that can be vacuum sealed.) I&#039;m sure it&#039;s mainly for food, but I think it would be kind of cool for cannabis or mushroom storage.<br /><br />sdesu
