				i&#039;ve used it infrequently (1-5 times per year) for the last 8 years or so, but now that i&#039;ve got access to SR things are changing.&nbsp; the last time I did MDMA was 3 days ago, next one going back was 11 days prior to that, then the next one was 3 months prior.<br /><br />So i&#039;m feeling the urge to take some tonight, but I think its probably a bad idea considering that it was only 3 days ago.&nbsp; i&#039;m gonna try to refrain, but i&#039;m not sure I will.&nbsp; <br /><br />wish i had some xanax or something to chill myself out so I could forget about the love powder sitting in my closet

				To me, I feel the limit is 2 days in a row; anything beyond that is just plain unhealthy for you, both physically and mentally. If you do do it the 2nd day in a row, I think the typical &quot;doubling&quot; rule works well.<br /><br />Honestly though, while I enjoy MDMA, I still recognize that it&#039;s just a chemical and isn&#039;t the real source of my happiness. MDMA does allow someone to open the doors to happiness though if they are in need of soul searching/cleansing.<br /><br />Try not to do it more than once a week, I&#039;d say at least 2 weeks myself. You&#039;re brain is just too important to be killing it with petty human urges.

				I had an urge to roll a 2nd night in a row and I did not resist this urge. The effects lasted maybe two hours. I redosed and got maybe an hour and I was fucking bored for the entire night.<br />The next day I had horrible mini-seizure brain-zaps like with SSRI-withdrawals and they lasted for three days and I couldn&#039;t sleep for two nights. Now the idea of doing MDMA seems very uninteresting to me.

				replace mdma with something else, like 2c-b or foxy or maybe shrooms and keep all the drugs in rotation, at least that&#039;s how I do it. fun weekends and no feeling like shit the rest of teh week. oh and also I take 5-htp and piracetam during the working days.
