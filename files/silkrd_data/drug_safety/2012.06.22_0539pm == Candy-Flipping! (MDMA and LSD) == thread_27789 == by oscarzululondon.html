				I&#039;ve been a long time user of MDMA, but recently I&#039;ve been candy flipping (taking MDMA &amp; LSD at the same time) and some really strange things have started to happen, but not what I would have expected. <br /><br />Before taking LSD but even with MDMA I used to have what would be considered very Right Wing (Conservative) political values, such as self sufficiency and running your own business, not using any kind of state benefits including healthcare, education etc, however after my first LSD session, and note this happened a few days after, not whilst I was in it, I started to have more what I would consider Socialist or left wing thoughts, just in every day, from walking past hobo&#039;s on the street and having a chat with them and giving them money even though I know they won&#039;t do good things with it to feeling sorry for people when their businesses go bust and having a desire to help for nothing in return. These are things I would never ever ever have done before.<br /><br />After my third or so LSD trip other weird things started happening, like now I&#039;m convinced God exists in some form and that everything is somehow connected, although I can&#039;t explain how. I understand how, but I don&#039;t know how to explain it to someone else. This is weird because I was the most atheist person I know and always used to defend atheism when having family debates etc and constantly criticized religion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed a few other weird things, like I was having an evening forest barbecue &amp; bonfire party with my girlfriend and several friends last weekend, and everyone at the party was taking stuff, but only a few of us were taking LSD. However the people who took LSD, including me and my girlfriend could talk to each other without talking. It wasn&#039;t immediate, or even quantifiable, I think it happened after about 4 hours and lasted for about 2 hours, but I could know what they were thinking. Me and my friend even had a whole conversation in our heads from opposite sides of the fire (a good 20 meters), other people at the party confirm we never ever went near each other that night or talked together, but a few days later me and him had a chat and the fire conversation had actually happened. I knew things about him that he had never told me. How can this be? Am I just going crazy?<br /><br />Other than that things are better than ever, my business is doing really well and physically I feel better than I have in years or decades even, I even look better, I have a glow I haven&#039;t had since childhood. I&#039;ve been trying to research this stuff online but there&#039;s a severe lack of proper empirical scientific studies....

				I really like this post Oscar. I have noticed many of these same changes in myself after I first took LSD. There is really something magical about it that I have yet to find in other drugs. This post reinforces my desire to help everyone experience this magic. Thank you for sharing.

				I&#039;m critical regarding a telepathic conversation resulting in gaining childhood knowledge as anyone should be.<br /><br />When I was a heavy roller I was known as the &quot;mind reader&quot;. I have always attributed it to the chemical I was on opened my perception to the point where I could very accurately read body language, extrapolate their thoughts/response from what I knew and the present information we were both privy to, and in turn have that &quot;psychic&quot; link where we were on the same wavelength.<br /><br />I do not disregard what people believe but I will not accept information without scientific backing. No this does not leave me closed minded it leaves me critical of all information serving me very well in my life. I find beauty in other belief systems as long as they do not oppress other beings.<br /><br />My reason for posting here is keep on thinking beautiful thoughts my friends, people like me need people like you and vice versa. We keep each other in balance so that we may grow as one in every direction imaginable. We have much more potential that we&#039;ve been able to perceive, lets keep bringing it to new levels.

				HAHAHAHA!!!!<br /><br />that post was amazing, dude, really made me smile.<br /><br />yes, candyflipping is awesome, and no, what you have been experiencing is not unusual to this drug combo.&nbsp; all of these experiences you mention, socialist thought patterns, feeling the presence of god, telepathy...they are all symptoms of a greater realization which you are moving towards:&nbsp; WE ARE ONE<br /><br />you, me, your friends, that homeless guy, barack obama, hosni mubarak, jesus christ, the dalai lama, the kid who beat you up in kindergarten....we are all one thing.&nbsp; and you may call that thing &quot;god&quot; if you wish, but I go by many names...<br /><br />keep candyflippin, but go easy on the MDMA while going heavy on the LSD and you will see what what you are reading right now is true.<br /><br />good shit man, you&#039;re on the right path&nbsp; 8)

				Something like this happened to me and two of my friends. We did self cultured mushrooms for the first time (3g dried per capita). On the maximum of the effect, we just stand near each other, looked around and everyone knew what the others were thinking. Everything made perfectly sense for that few hours.<br /><br />I never did LSD (but the effects are comparable, I guess).<br /><br />Just thinking about doing a candyflip makes me nervous, I think. Drugs, especially psychadelics, have a strong effect in your brain and I think mixing it with other drugs (MDMA) can cause some brainchemical problems that I just don&#039;t want to face or imagine.

				Haha,&nbsp; Yeah it may be a spoiler if you&#039;re satisfied/fulfilled with reading the words &quot;We are one&quot;... but the fact that keeps me exploring further is that we are one, but we are separate perspectives, experiencing now from our bodies.&nbsp; We are one, but there are still so many in this world who are misdirected and hurting themselves/others unknowing of the possibilities of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;I wanted to ask oscarzululondon, what were the arguments you used to have for atheism that you no longer subscribe to? and..&nbsp; Did those opinions change over night (after a revelation candyflippin&#039;)?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I had been a Christian and still believe that Christ was a man sent to fulfill a prophecy/show us that we are free of the burden of sin if we choose to be, but after taking entheogens like shrooms, salvia, LSD, and morning glory, I have such a changed perspective and view the (not exclusively) christian church as misguided/closed minded (not that I can blame them). I use these substances with the belief that it&#039;s God&#039;s will that I do so (using given free will), and humanity will benefit (to some extent) from my experience.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been let down, but see that others are let down by life when they put it in the wrong box and choose not to explore the possibilities.. I have experienced what I believe to be telepathic moments, but by no means know how to control it. Salvia seemed to lead to thoughts leaving my mind... Seemed. <br /><br />PS.. Oscar, You mentioned your business is doing well... are you hiring?&nbsp; 8D
