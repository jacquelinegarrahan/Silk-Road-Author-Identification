				Would this be relatively safe long term?&nbsp; Smoking weed everyday causes my roommate to bitch about the smell, not like I give a shit what she says but if this is safe I&#039;ll provably smoke less.

				Are you talking about a small daily dosage? It might help, but the answer to your question is that regular use of MDMA is never a good idea, even though its nuerotoxicity is somewhat debatable.

				I think that tolerance would stop you being able to use it daily and then it would just be plain unhealthy.

				The neurotoxicity is for real with larger doses... what it means in the long run is not known. The majority can be prevented with proper precautions (antioxidants, vitamins, other supplements) and moderation.<br /><br />http://dancesafe.org/drug-information/ecstasy-slideshow<br /><br />Maybe suggest to her a shared MDMA session together.

				Terrible idea, if anything you&#039;ll end up depressed and more anxious. Why not take a proper dose on occasion and try to work through the underlying issues that cause your social anxiety?

				I think you should look into issues surrounding your social anxiety a bit more, that being said i&#039;m a &quot;wake&#039;n&#039;baker&quot; myself but only to make the hours go quicker at work lol

				If you take a quantity of MDMA every single day, you will most certainly induce serotonin syndrome.<br /><br />That&#039;s what the low end benzo&#039;s are for (xanax, clonazepam) ... social anxiety

				wowzers and others here have it right with their suggestions of looking at the underlying issues.<br /><br />Putting a temporary band-aid on the problem with an addictive drug (Benzos, xanax, etc) will only delay any healing and create a larger problem. This might be an opportunity to tactfully discuss the issue with your roommate and find a way you can both be satisfied.<br /><br />MDMA and like tools, with the right set and setting, can give us an opportunity for growth.

				YES!! vaporizer is the answer to your roommate problem. I vape in my dorm room all the time without any detection from RA&#039;s or complaints from my non smoking roommate. <br /><br />I suggest just trying MDMA on a night that you go to a club or bar, i read that E can help social anxiety and autism, but not if you take it everyday.

				Drugs aren&#039;t the answer to social anxiety. And stay away from benzos like klonopin and xanax. They&#039;re really meant for just a few weeks at most. I took them for years almost daily and the withdrawl is horrible.

				Definitely not, MDMA is something you should do once a month and no more. <br /><br />Methylone you can do more often but even still its not a good idea.<br /><br />Look into nootropics such as Aniracetam and even Phenibut and Picamillion.

				Not even once a month ;) if you&#039;re using it for social anxiety you shouldn&#039;t use it much at all maybe 3 or so times your life spacing it out about 60-120 mg doses or more depending on your weight , etc.

				Have you tried methylone. Methylone is much better for hanging out with friends/going out to a bar. It isn&#039;t too strong and it won&#039;t give you a comedown. It doesn&#039;t really get you *THERE* (you all know what I mean) so it isn&#039;t going to fuck you up long term.<br /><br />((WEEEERE GOING TO GET THERE TONIGHT!!!))
