				SWIM has a local connect that a friend went through recently for MDMA. It was apparently crystalline quality and in his own words &quot;pure&quot; from his experience with other MDMA. He also went on to tell me that it caused him to hallucinate. His description of the hallucination was of a lamp post. The halo from the light was in the form of squares / rectangles that traveled away from the light and disappeared with almost a popping sound.<br /><br />From what I know about MDMA it wouldn&#039;t cause such a hallucination. Is there any such substance that you can think that would cause hallucinations in such a manner (MDA, MDEA, Sassafras)?

				It&#039;s not unheard of MDMA giving people visual and auditory hallucinations, especially on higher amounts.<br />I once ate about 0.5 gr of highest quality Dutch mdma (that i got on SR :) ) and the effects were overwhelming, and sure enough I had unmistakable hallucinations. They weren&#039;t like traditional acid or shroom hallucinations in nature, they were more blocky (pixelated) and it was also like I was watching a movie with missing frames, pictures were jumpy.<br />Imo with mdma there is a sweet spot dose after which you get negative effects like nystagmus (eye wiggles) and jaw clenching much more pronounced. Sometimes less is more, and that&#039;s definitely the case with mdma. :D<br /><br />On the other hand MDA is much more likely to produce hallucinations, but i believe it&#039;s pretty rare and uncommon substance to run into.

				if i take a lot i see some random, rather solid looking hallucinations that are there one min and gone the next, usually towards the end of the night, the same thing happened with 4-mmc too. ive seen animated characters in blue neon in the sky like they were being drawn by a laser, ive seen a red brick wall with a tiny door in and a chair next to it and various other random things that are there one min then gone the next. the strange thing about these specific hallucinations is they seem much more &quot;real&quot; than say lsd or shroom ones, they appear more solid and less ethereal if you will (i once saw my cat chewing on the top of a water bottle, my cat was over 100 miles away at the time! but it looked like i could have touched him it looked that real)

				It&#039;s definitely possible for mdma to give visual hallucinations, though not that common in the normal dosage range.<br /><br />MDA, on the other hand, has pretty psychedelic effects.

				I remember presses at raves in the 90&#039;s that had me trippin&#039; balls. Not like lsd at all but more than likely MDA. We never knew of course. We were just like, &quot;okay, a pill, I&#039;ll take it, whatever&quot;. <br />I can remember mostly closed eye visuals with like crazy geometric patterns everywhere. I rather liked it even though I knew what I had taken wasn&#039;t MDMA.

				Ha, a mate of mine was so out of it one night on MDMA, he felt a bit tired while dancing and decided to lean against the chair next to dance floor. Reached out his hand to rest on the chair, and slid it down the back of some bloke hairy arse....<br /><br />He came over to tell me all shocked, I was fucked myself, so I was like yer what ever.<br /><br />The next day I&#039;m like WTF, did you really slide your finger down some blokes crack?

				I&#039;ve a few ;) of the 90&#039;s pills (555,octagon Elephants,yellow dolphins, cccp in different colors,...., all those nice little pills landed within the german techno scene(ffm)) an a few means sometimes 10-25 over a weekend.... long time ago ;); i def know that you can get hallucinations from mdmd. you cant compare them to any kind of psychedelic drug haluu like lsd,psyl.,mesk,...but they are here sometimes ;)<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace

				You can get visuals from a decent dose of MDMA. You don&#039;t have to take a stupid amount.<br /><br />MDE and MDA are more likely to give your visuals at a threshold dose.
