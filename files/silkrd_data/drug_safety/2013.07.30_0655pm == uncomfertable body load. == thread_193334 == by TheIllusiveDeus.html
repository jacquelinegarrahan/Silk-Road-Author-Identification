				My friend is having a weird problem. Shes still relatively new to the drug scene and whenever she gets really high she has a very uncomfortable body load that last even after shes not high anymore. Same thing happens when shes tripping. Shes says that she feels an uncomfortable pressure in her head around her brain. Not just a pushing sensation but more of as sensation that somethings moving around in her head. She says if she smokes too much weed that it can actually start to be painful. Is she just psyching herself out and making herself feel bad or what?&nbsp; :o<br />

				I recommend a blood pressure cuff for drug users.<br /><br />How many drugs does this happen with?<br /><br />Side effects are pretty common.&nbsp; Many users will find the benefits aren&#039;t worth the sides that they get.&nbsp; I&#039;ve certainly had negative body load last longer than the high.

				The only thing other then weed shes done is Jannis&#039;s acid once. She felt bad after that for a week. She really wants to try shrooms but is a bit nervous about feeling bad.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend shrooms for her.<br /><br />Personally my body feels best on MDMA which I guess gives me a body high.&nbsp; MDMA also helps me to filter out letting drugs with a negative body load ruin things.&nbsp; That is...the drugs still give me a negative body load but it doesn&#039;t bother me as much.&nbsp; The comeup on MDMA can be hard but I&#039;m in bliss after that.

				any headache? i get a pressure in my head quite a lot and used to get migraines but have remedied it with body therapy. i recommend massaging the base of the skull and muscles of the back of the neck.<br />for me i would examine where the feeling is coming from exactly in the head, where it moves, and try and get close contact with the feeling.&nbsp; sometimes following the movement can help to relieve any pain or pressure.<br />it may be blood flow or fluid. marijuana does not help this pressure for me, it makes it worse in the week or two after smoking (for me).<br />if she trips again she should be prepared for it to happen again, but if she pays very close attention to it and follows the movement she may be able to find out whats causing it.<br />
