				Have you tried melatonin, some people get success from it. GHB (Xyrem) is sometimes used. Some people smoke weed. <br /><br />Be careful with sleep drugs, they are super easy to become dependent on them, and then you really won&#039;t be able to sleep without them at all. Try to only use them short term if at all possible, its really not something you want to get hooked on.

				Try eating gelatin. It&#039;s very high in the amino acid glycine, which calms excess brain activity. Alternately, try magnesium glycinate aka &#039;chelated magnesium&#039;. <br /><br />As for drugs, try picamilon, it&#039;s GABA bound to vitamin B3, Valerian extract may also help.

				if you dont have to be awake after 6 hours but can at least sleep for 8 nothing beats a small dose of alprazolam or carisoprodol with a small antihistamine dose, 25mg of diphenhydramine or 12.5mg of hydroxyzine work very well. wash down with plenty of water. sleep quality will be deep and very relaxing, given you are properly hydrated, both antihistamines cause dehydration. dreams are also well enhanced. remains effective for quite some time. <br /><br />melatonin also is very effective, but builds tolerance quick. +1mg will do.<br /><br />an afghan dominant weed strain equals sure sleep aswell. sleep quality is kind of lousy though. remains effective, even with massive weed tolerance. <br /><br />ghb/gbl just more or less knocks you out for 4-5 hours, there is a chance that you will wake up when the effects are through. also very habit-forming. bad safety profile too. use with caution/only in really desperate situations only (for sleep).

				I could have 15-20mg melatonin and still be tossing and turning at night for the next couple of hours.<br />Mirtazapine is the only drug that i find is impossible to actually stay awake for me (i&#039;ve tried just about every single downer and could stay up all night if need be). But its a prescription anti-depressant so i doubt you would have much luck getting it.

				Melatonin has always worked wonders for me, and being a supplement and not pharma you feel fine the next day.<br /><br /><br />Its over the counter, no sides effects (for me anyway) and rather cheap.<br /><br />I think a usual size tablet is 3mg. Don&#039;t be scared to eat a few of them. 9mg is a standard dose for me. Its not going to knock you out like a narc.<br /><br />but if you eat them and close your eyes and &quot;try to sleep&quot; you&#039;ll drift right off.<br /><br />

				Sleep is a difficult thing to work out, because its dependent on many other things in your life. If you can find the time in your day (or even once a week) working out HARD is a good thing to help you. Even just once a week if you get a good nights sleep it can keep you in rhythm. <br /><br />Failing that... well... like I say its hard. Benzos will almost certainly knock you out, but that&#039;s not always a good thing, making it so you can&#039;t sleep without them and they can react really badly with other drugs.<br /><br />My suggestion is weed. Not LOTS, just one just before bed. Lay down, chillax and sleep, hopefully. Basically, I&#039;m coming at this from two directions. Supplements don&#039;t work for everyone, but the things that definitely will make you sleep are pretty damn dangerous even with nothing in your body, with other drugs it can get really ugly. Weed may well do exactly as you want, but it won&#039;t get you addicted or accidentally kill you, and if weed doesn&#039;t work then at least your just stoned. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love me some Benzos, but they are a lot more dangerous than most people think and you&#039;ll have to watch your intake of them. <br /><br />Maybe you do just need to re-set your body clock and get two or three good nights of sleep to get you in swing, and for that, benzos are good. In the long term however, they aren&#039;t the best solution. Definitely look into a reasonably short half-life benzo though (clonazipam maybe). Valium is really long lasting and if you take it a few days in a row you can end up ODing because what you took two days ago is still in your body, and thats bad.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t used benzos before and still can&#039;t get a good nights sleep using smallish doses of them, then go see a doctor. Larger doses pretty much HAVE to work, but if you need that much right off the bat then you genuinely might have a medical problem, rather than just generic &#039;can&#039;t sleep&#039;. At the very least you can get some advice on what is and isn&#039;t safe for your body size/type, even if they won&#039;t write you a script right away.

				I went through a period of terrible insomnia for several months. I tried all the usual suspects, sleep meds, valerian root, GABA, but to no avail. I then read about how Seroquel, an atypical antipsychotic, was used in hospitals in very low doses (25-50mg) for this condition. Apparently, Seroquel is a heavy hypnotic. Tried it and it worked.<br /><br />Some report vivid dreams with this med, and I did have a couple. The only issue is one will habituate to the dose after about a week or so which then requires a higher dose. I recommend not using it for more than a couple nights in a row to minimize this from happening.<br /><br />Insomnia can be brutal to one&#039;s functioning. Hope this helps ...

				I am from the Netherlands.<br />Many years ago, we had a commercial running at our national television.<br />It showed that the best way to get to sleep is to knock yourself out with a hammer.<br />In a cartoon was a man showed, who knocked himself out with a hammer.<br />I do not see that commercial anymore, so I think that someone indeed used a baseball-bat or something, but the message is/was clear.<br /><br />There are no save drugs when it comes to help you put asleep. <br /><br />Once used to drugs -pams it is hard to do without.<br />Something like nitrazepam is not allowed on the U.S market.<br />Mice get cancer from it.<br />Sold just the same in Europe.<br />People are not mice, and if the patiënt does get cancer it is difficult to proof if the cancer was caused by the nitrazepam or something else.<br />Al medicine ending with -pam are dangerous.<br />Even though the farmaceutical company sais in it&#039;s prescription that is save to use for 2 weeks, I can tell you that 4 or 5 day&#039;s are for me the max.<br />Two weeks of using some kind of -pam will leave me / you with a sleeping problem much greater then when you started with the -pam medicine use.<br /><br />So the best drug for sleep is ...;<br />A baseball-bat!<br /><br />I have done more then one week without sleep.<br />The eight or nineth day you will fall asleep.<br />I had no more sleep then 20 minutes over a 3 week period in total.<br />Sleep will come no matter what or how much pain.<br /><br />Drugs will help temporarily, but will leave you worse then when you started to take the drugs.<br />

				Don&#039;t even think about seroquel please, that is the worst one you can imagine. What it does it removes all the dopamine and serotonin in your brain (your happy chemicals). Then your brain has to regenerate them over time, leaving you like an emotionless zombie the next day.<br />Melatonin is the best mainly cause our brains produce melatonin naturally this occurs with our circadian rhythm, but also too much melatonin can make your brain think &#039;well i&#039;ve got heaps of it already i wont need to produce any more&#039; back to square one now even worse cause you have to wait for the melatonin producers to kick back in again (By not allowing this to happen is closely monitor how much you take and try to have melatonin free nights quite often 2-3 nights a week)<br />I totally understand your situation i&#039;ve been there and back, that&#039;s why my market is in benzos. <br />I&#039;ve got 6x30mg mirtazapine which can easily be split into halves (trust me thats all you will be needing). If you are interested pm me on my sellers account cozmo on SR, i&#039;ll do these for free +shipping.<br />But also mirtazapines also have their side effects, the next day you tend to be REALLY docile and like you&#039;re on benzos. So bascially you&#039;ve taken a klonopin. Also affects your appetite makes you starving. But the great thing is its an anti-depressant so those &quot;happy chemicals&quot; serotonin dopamine blah blah blah, mirtaz actually helps those. And if you are feeling better about your self chances are it will be easier the next night to doze off. <br />Please stay away from the seroquel dude, its nothing but trouble, and it will cause more chemical imbalances than you need in your life now.<br />PM me on SR i want to put you out of your suffering.

				I&#039;m not sure, i tried not drinking/eating before i sleep so maybe if i digested properly that that wouldn&#039;t be a problem. I have dreams/nightmares some days but not everyday, and as soon as i wake up i forget if i even had a dream. As im trying to fall asleep though, there are some body parts that i feel like i have to move before i feel relaxed. Can breathing play a factor in this? Is this a common thing with everyone or could it be that something is the problem?

				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea<br />Cause you mentioned breathing difficulties. But you won&#039;t even know you have that unless you&#039;re partner would&#039;ve mentioned it to you. But its not really a snore its more of a taking in a large amount of air in a very short period.<br />What do you do for work? Do you go to the gym? Do you nap during the day? Regular eating schedule? <br />When you get your body into a rhythm its kinda easy to stay there, good or bad rhythms its the same to the body.<br />It is also important to work out your body make sure its actually done something so it does have time to recover.

				Pop 2mg of Xanax. Good night my friend :D. If that does not work which im sure 99% it will. Mix ativan with xanax. This is what I do when I cannot sleep even when Ive injested too many dirty&nbsp; e pills with meth in them. It works every time. be careful tho. Ive become addicted to doing this in the past and its hard to get off but its a great short term solution. After you do the benzo cocktail and sleep good. Go for a jog on the beach for a good while when the sun is out. You will absorb lots of serotonin through your eyes that will be converted to melatonin later on in the day so you can sleep. Taking melatonin pills has never worked for my insomia. So stick to the natual sun method and or benzos.&nbsp;

				I find Etizolam (currently legal to buy as an RC in the UK) works great. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etizolam<br /><br />1mg is considered roughly in terms of potency about 10mg Valium but is a shorter acting so more suited to helping you sleep I find. Less lasting effects the next day.<br /><br />chems2u tend to offer a fairly reliable service with fast delivery and cheap. I&#039;d recommend them if you wanted decide to purchase Etizolam.
