				Has anyone filtered one or more of these with a wheel filter before? There is coloring in them that may not filter out but most of the other stuff should. <br /><br />They have a lot of morphine per pill and no time release mechanism, they&#039;re also pretty cheap.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made vials (like hatters) with old style oxycontin in the past but never morphine, and these statex things seem like they&#039;d work well if you like IV morphine.<br /><br />WARNING: see my reply below about the aluminum dye, know what you&#039;re getting in to if you inject these.

				I did a test run with a few of these and it worked fine, I think the lactose went in to solution along with some of the coloring (which I don&#039;t like but there&#039;s nothing that can be done about it). The rest filtered out, leaving a slightly yellowish solution. If you miss a shot or a small amount &quot;leaks&quot; back through a vein afterward it will puff your skin a little but that probably happens with any morphine shot. It goes away fast.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how wise it is to inject tartrazine or some of the other coloring in these pills, I wish they were simply white with an imprint. I don&#039;t see any immediate negative reaction.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t going to be making a vial and just want to shoot one or two, you can just mix in a spoon using about 1ml sterile water or 2ml saline per pill, then draw through a cotton ball in to a 3-5ml syringe with a luer connection (not insulin). This gets rid of most of the filler before you push through a fine syringe filter. I used a small diameter 0.1um. Push the solution through it in to the front or back (if using insulin type for actual shots) of other syringes.<br /><br />If you are going to make a vial, it will be easier to crush up about 5-10 pills and drop them in the back of a 10-20ml luer syringe, then draw up 1ml sterile water or 2ml saline per pill, shake and let sit for a few minutes, then push through a larger diameter syringe filter (you may need to use more than one, switching half way if the first gets clogged). You&#039;ll need to use a 0.4um pore size for this and at least 25-33mm diameter or it will likely clog the filter. After that stage you will have a mostly clear solution that can push through ANOTHER&nbsp; 0.2 or 0.1um without trouble, straight in to a sterile vial (using a needle to fill through the stopper). Best to do the filtering in stages and not try to push all that pill stuff through a super fine filter all at once. You do want to filter a 2nd time with a 0.2um or 0.1um as that will nearly sterilize the solution, bacteria cannot fit through the pores in a filter that fine.<br /><br />You can add some bacteriostatic saline or water to the vial afterward (or just a small bit of benzyl alcohol} but I wouldn&#039;t use it for filtering the pills, it might cause things you don&#039;t want to dissolve to stay in the water, or it might affect morphine solubility but I don&#039;t know that.<br /><br />If you use sterile water instead of saline you may be able to get up to 50mg dissolved in 1ml but I prefer to shoot 0.9% saline and it looks as though only 25-30mg can dissolve in that stuff, so 2ml are necessary for each 50mg pill.

				Thanks for the info!&nbsp; :) I just discovered these pills not to long ago and I&#039;m really enjoying them (especially when they&#039;re so cheap!). I was using a wheel filter at first and noticed it would catch some orange stuff although the solution afterwards would still have a slight tint to it. Unfortunately I ran out of usable wheel filters so for the past week I have only been using cotton to filter the solution...I know it&#039;s not the ideal situation but I&#039;ve been blessed with great veins so it&#039;s extremely rare that I miss a shot...so hopefully I&#039;m not doing to much damage!

				I&#039;ve decided these may actually be quite dangerous to shoot even if you filter them correctly, the reason being that the coloring used isn&#039;t just a dye, it&#039;s an &quot;aluminum lake&quot; dye. <br /><br />What that means is when they make the dye to use in these pills (and other things), they take an aluminum salt powder and allow it to absorb the dye, and then use that in the product to color it. Aluminum lake dyes are in a lot of things, but we&#039;re the only ones injecting them, other pharmaceutical injections sometimes have aluminum in them but VERY small amounts, and I have no idea how much is in these pills it could be on the order of a few milligrams (bad, too much).<br /><br />My suspicion is that if you can see the coloring in the final injection you&#039;re injecting aluminum salts, which puts you at a risk of aluminum toxicity, which is a rather serious thing. I advise anyone shooting these to think long and hard about it because you may be risking more than the standard infection or particle floating around your blood, aluminum could make you very sick very fast. <br /><br />At the least don&#039;t shoot these things all day every day, give your body time to heal if it can. Some medical journals have cases of people injecting aluminum salts over long periods and needing special treatment to recover.<br /><br />update- its aluminum hydroxide and aluminum oxide they use to make the dye, the first is only soluble in water at about 1mcg/ml and the 2nd isn&#039;t soluble at all so that will limit the damage somewhat, but over time it adds up, be careful.
