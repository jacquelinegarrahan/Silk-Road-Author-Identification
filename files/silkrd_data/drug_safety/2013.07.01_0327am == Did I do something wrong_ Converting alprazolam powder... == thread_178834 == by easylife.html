				I had 250mp of alprazolam powder and 300mg of propylene glycol. I&nbsp; oured the bag of powder into the liquid, I placed the bowl inside a larger bowel for a warm water bath. I missed and wait for hours. I have an insulin needle that has 100cc. 100cc = 1ml. Whenever I put it on the sourpatch kids or mint, it absorbs very little and the rest run off. what am i doing wrong since the candy is not taking the entire 1ml. what am i doing wrong?

				Most benzo solutions I&#039;ve seen contained acetic acid and propylene glycol, perhaps its only soluble in an acidic environment?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;d want to inject anyways, oral bioavailability is over 90% IIRC.

				I think this guy is trying to inject the sour patch or mints with the benzo, not inject himself with it.&nbsp; The more scary part is he doesn&#039;t know ml/cc let alone have a clue how many mgs would be going in.&nbsp; Great.....

				hey mate alprozolam is a tricky one when trying to imprenate on something... when i laid it onto paper i needed to do 2 extra relay&#039;s becayse there was over 200mg of run off after the first lay&nbsp; ( it was 900 square sheet laying at 2mg about with 1850 mg of powder) I was expecting to be able to micro pipette this stuff onto the square but that wasn&#039;t even possible because it was so saturated&nbsp; as compared to the lesser mass of a nbmoe.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think what you need to do is figure out the max liquid your candy will support on its surface(so alcohol will vaporize and leave powder) or absorb on its surface. 1ml is a lot to dilute it out too aswell.. <br /><br />Defiantly&nbsp; use a syringe with air in it and push against the bottom of the mixure to mix your product up faster using a air jet, if you&#039;re doing it in a small glass or shot glass&nbsp; putting a pot to boil and resting the container in a shallow bath suspended with tongs&nbsp; you could get it heat up very hot to get a way better blend which is a slight problem because alcohol will evaporate quickly so its best to preheat it before you mix it together.. Also hot liquid will jet out of your syringe from the pressure&nbsp; if you arent careful. Kinda funny but can cause notable problems if disregarded..

				One measurement that certainly is wrong: 1 cc should be once cubic centimetre, hence 1 millilitre. <br /><br />This is also a fairly large volume of liquid compared to candies and such. You may be just able to absorb it into a sugar cube, but something like a small mint is far smaller than one ml. <br /><br />If you are in any doubt about this: a centimeter is just under half an inch. So you you wanted to add a cubit cemtimeter of liquid to a piece of candy that candy needs to be about a&nbsp; 0.4 inch cube to be equal to the volume of 1 ml.

I would have hoped by now you would have figured this out as well as how accurately will you be able to measure the amount of migs per unit? Because, as mentioned above and what I was trying to get you to figure out on your own, there is no way you will get 1cc/ml into a sourpatch.

				I understand that; I wasn&#039;t trying to be derogatory to the community at large.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are people who are intelligent, motivated, and whatnot, but those people aren&#039;t the one&#039;s spamming the forums because they&#039;re too lazy to use the search function.&nbsp; I guess since I see a lot of it I just started to feel like that most people are pulling that shit.
