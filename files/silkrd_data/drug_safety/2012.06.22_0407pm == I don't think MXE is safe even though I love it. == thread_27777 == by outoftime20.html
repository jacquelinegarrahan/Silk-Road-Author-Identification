				Does anyone else not trust MXE? I did 1 gram over the course of about 2 weeks. I am into health and check my vital signs with a monitor every day. I noticed my blood oxygen level plummeting on the stuff and had abnormal heart rates as well. I also just had a feeling like something was off, had an odd stomach cramp like feeling and my pee felt like there was hot sauce in it or something! I absolutely love the stuff, especially in small doses throughout the day, but I don&#039;t think it is worth sacrificing my health for... Anyone else feel the same way?

				I really like MXE and don&#039;t know much about its long-term effects but the few times I have indugled Ive caught myself thinking: &quot;Wow this is reeeeeally very powerful&quot; and that has lead me to believe it might not be the heathist hobby in the entire world.

				Depends on how safe you&#039;re talking, here. While MXE is safer for your liver than Ketamine, it still has some heptatic toxicity. A gram over the course of 2 weeks I would probably throw in the &quot;less safe&quot; category, and indulging a few times I would probably throw into the &quot;more safe&quot; category, but when it comes down to it, all drug use has inherent dangers, and so figuring out what drug use styles are worth the risk is really up to the user.

				You&#039;re taking the substance way too much and way too often in my opinion. I milk my gram bags for months at a time for instance, way longer than two weeks dude! :o Learn how to pace yourself and take a break from the stuff every few days. It&#039;s no wonder MXE is banned with people like you ruining it for us. :-\

				To me (and a few others I assume too), MXE has a therapeutic / medicinal quality to it. Its a comfy lifestyle substance which IMO is best taken no more than once per 3 days or twice per five days. Those aren&#039;t entirely arbitrary numbers I&#039;ve selected. Why those numbers? For me the nice after-glow / contentment from a decent MXE session lasts about 3-4 days with no significant desires to have some more. Also aiming to keep tolerance low is a big help.<br /><br />I don&#039;t doubt that its not a good substance for some people, so I don&#039;t want to try and convince anyone that &quot;its good&quot;. I just want to encourage a thoughtful dosing regime because the experience I&#039;ve had so far I would like others the opportunity too. With a 1 session per 3 days or 2 sessions per 5 days I think 1G lasts about 2 months, and tolerance seems to stay low (so far).

				i think mxe is relatively safe... i&#039;ve gone through 500 mg in 3 days with no negative effects. if you are doing it often enough that it&#039;s detrimental to your health, it&#039;s time to take a break.

				I am always surprised how different people react on MXE.<br />For me MXE is very sedative:<br />&nbsp;- never experienced changes in heard rate or blood pressure<br />&nbsp;- I used it so many times to come down from stimulants and&nbsp; falling to sleep very fast <br />&nbsp;- it gets ride of all anxiety<br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t like full dissociation so I don&#039;t use big doses. <br />What is interesting I absolutely do not care about music while on it.. but with other drugs an when sober I listen to music and enjoy it almost all the time.

				Only thing I would say is that despite what people say MXE is just as bad for your kidneys as K. A friend of mine was quite into it at one point and he ended up pissing blood after too many binges. Epic fail.

It makes music sound better, although not to the level that 2C-E or LSD does. It can help me get to sleep, or even give me energy depending on the dosage. One major plus to MXE is that it works as a great potentiator for my other favored drugs, especially cannabis. MXE is cheap enough that it doesn&#039;t break my bank, and because it makes smoking bud so much more potent I don&#039;t have to spend as much on weed either. As of now it seems less dangerous than alcohol, so I&#039;d much rather snort a quick bump and feel good rather than down a few beers and feel sick. MXE is a wonder drug I think as it has such a wide range of uses and always pleasantly surprises me when I try a new dose. I don&#039;t recommend it to anyone I know though because I&#039;m aware of how much more experience I have taking drugs as a whole than most and doubt they&#039;ll understand it in the same way I do, but I&#039;m more than happy giving advice to those who&#039;re curious. ^-^

				I have mentioned this previously I think but the best K-Quote I ever heard is this - <br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s the thing about Ketamine, when you are on it the world make sense but then you come down and everything is confusing again&quot;<br /><br />Heard it from some guy we met on the train home from a night out at Fabric, was epic.

I must say, I don&#039;t really &quot;get it&quot;. First time was was probably about 50mg sublingual...felt a bit out of it.&nbsp; Two days later, 100mg over the course of 3 hours or so. I don&#039;t really get the appeal. I had to hang on to the walls to move about, I felt trapped in my own head (not uncomfortably so though), music sounded like crap (big downside for me, everything was flanging and tinny)...so I gotta say, I just don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Never tried ketamine though, and would like to.&nbsp; Never tried DXM either, but have no desire to really.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, have you tried it with good weed though? I remember my first time on MXE some months ago and I tried a 25mg sublingual dose and only felt the symptoms you listed above. They were just very uncomfortable, nothing more. Then yesterday, after I read a little more about it I tried it again. I started with approx. 15 mg intranasally and took some hits of great weed which took the whole experience to another positive level. From there I went on with little bumps and hits here and there and it was such a different and much better experience. <br />(Also as previously mentioned both of these substances potentiate each other, so start with low doses.)<br /><br />I can only recommend Methoxetamine + Weed.

				Im gonna agree with the OP on this one.&nbsp; Not safe but I love it.&nbsp; But how important is safety?<br /><br />I had a major psychotic episode after using about 10 grams in about 2.5-3 weeks.&nbsp; All day, every day, and then abruptly stopping when I ran out.&nbsp; &nbsp;The trick is to go easy on the shit and everything will be okay...<br />I have also seen a friend go limp and comatose drooling on herself with a big line of mxe combined with a pint or so of gin.&nbsp; Not smart, I know, but It was terrifying - all we could do was make sure that she was breathing and get her out of the bar.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with all yall that ketamine is better- searching for a cheap K substitute led me to MXE.&nbsp; These days I&#039;ll still fuck with the MXE but really will go out of my way to stick to the K.&nbsp; Also the long half life of the MXE can be annoying compared to the quick up and down of K.
