				Hello Everyone<br /><br />My past experience with psychadelic drug is only LSD. I enjoy it very much. But I have never ingested mofre than 400ug at one time. I have also read a lot about experience of other people on mescalin and dmt. I would very much love to one day try these two psychadelics. Can any knowledgable person please tell me more about different type of dmt option which is for sale on sr?<br /><br />There is for sale Pills, Change, Free Base, NN-DMT...White Powder Dmt..so many option...for first time user of DMT which is good way to start??<br /><br />With mescaline there is Synthetic Mescaline and also Mescaline Sulfat? what is the difference between them?<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />tunedin.

				i&#039;d recommend trying changa before freebase dmt, as it&#039;s gentler and not so alien. sulfate is an extract from cacti... i&#039;d go with the sulfate. synthetic mescaline just felt like an imitation of the real thing to me.

				Consuming your dmt is not the only way to check to see if your product has caustic salts in the product. Take the product and put some on the tip of a stainless steel knife. Grab a torch lighter and come from a side angle at the product, If the products sparks blue or makes any crackling noises you have caustic salts in your product. You want the dmt to just melt away peacefully, And quietly. <br />I would say that the best first way of smoking dmtWould be a full spectrum Alkaloid extract, Smoke out of a pipe that allows you to fill the chamber to So that all the smoke Stays for the most part in the chamber without going into your mouth Until you pull the carb or rush hole , Allowing for all the smoke to hit you at once. The body works with d m t Faster than almost any compound, And other compounds take heed At the blood brain barrier, Allowing for the dmt to be processed first. This is why the high is so short acting. If you wanna really get there, You need a method That allows you to process the dmt all at once, chants sorta of stretches the hit or hits out,

				Sorry. for the formatting. .&nbsp; I&#039;m on a smart phone and its not that smart. just remember to load up a lot because most people are very inefficient. at consuming it, and try to get all your sky in one massive hit or you&#039;ll just want to try again and nothing is like the first time if done right..
