				Hmm...I have no knowledge of any home remedy that would stop a strong histamine reaction :P Some physical activity could help divert your attention from it :) Are you a regular opiate user? I heard people get used to the itches and grow to actually love them :D Not me though :D...

				You need diphenhydramine or similar antihistamine . Benadryl I think they call it in states also Nytol in Uk. These ones make you drowsy and some people like that to enhance the opiate too. Or you might prefer a non drowsy antihistamine such as loratadine or certrazine. Hay fever remedies and stuff, some cough medicine has them in. Piriton or Piriteze are another brand.&nbsp; Any of these will stop the itching.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for learning to love it; it&#039;s more a case of if youre that high everything feels good, even scratching an itch till you draw blood.

				Like some have said, anti-histamines are the answer. Bendaryl is one over the counter option, but promethazine is the ultimate opiate companion. For my last two surgeries, I recieved a script for like 80 oxy 5s (not percs, roxi 5mg no tylenol) and with that prescription Doc gave me a bunch of promethazine.&nbsp; On the prometh script bottle it read &quot;Take 1 every 6 hours to treat nausea, itching, to help with sleep, and to boost the painkiller effect.&quot;<br /><br />It does all of that soo well. Especially nausea/itching, those side effects simply disappear bout a half hour after taking promethazine.&nbsp; I feel you on that crazy itch shit, not that I have fucked with H really, but even when Ive been on some hydros all day, I have itched my nose so much that it was red and raw the next day and eventually scabbed up hah.

				It depends on what is causing the itch really. If it is anything allergy related, something like dipenhydramide (usa benadryl) would be the medication of choice if you have no problem with the drowsiness it causes.<br /><br />There is, however, a tendency to prescribe/use antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness that badly. Cetirizine (zyrtec) would be a prime example of such a substance since it is very effective but doesn&#039;t cross the blood-brain barrier normally. Since i suffer for some allergies (insect bites mostly) i keep both substances at had, and choose diphenhydramide at night, but cetirizine during the day when i still need to function properly afterwards.<br /><br />All these substances are available over the counter in the us, and very affordable. It would probably be a good idea to keep a jar of both at hand if you are prone to tne condition.<br /><br />Antihistamines like diphenhydramide and doxylamine are mostly sold as sleep aids nowadays, but this changes nothing about their effectivity&nbsp; as antihistamines in the treatment of itches, allergies and such. Especially diphenhydramide has been re-labaled as a sleep aid (benadryl) while it remains to be a very potent antihistamine that is very useful in treating allergic reactions. While it is a very old substance, few or no non-drowsy antihistamines approach its potency.

				I&#039;m not sure about opiod related ones specifically, but itches can drive you crazy. I&#039;m somewhat allergic to mosquito bites myself, and whenever i get a new one, all the existing ones start to itch again too. The itch can certainly so bad that considering scraping it with a fork is an option, unless antihistamines are available and reduce it by 99% within half an hour. <br /><br />Also, it may be the healthy option: i&#039;ve seen people that scratched such bites open over and over again, resulting in infection, requirement for antibiotics and eventual scarring. All of that can often be prevented by taking a few tablets of an innocent antihistamine like cetirizine, which as very few side effects. Sedation may be one of them, but that would be no problem if taken before bedtime either.
