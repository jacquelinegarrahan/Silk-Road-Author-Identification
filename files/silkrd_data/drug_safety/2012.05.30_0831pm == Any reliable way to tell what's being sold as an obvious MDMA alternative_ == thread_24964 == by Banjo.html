				So the head shop where I get my hookah supplies and shisha has started carrying pills labeled, &quot;Roll Mood Enhancers&quot; (not for human consumption). No other labeling indicating what the hell is in it.<br /><br />Now I know a lot of those are nothing but bunk, but I also missed out on the whole legal methylone thing because I thought it must be bunk too, and didn&#039;t realize otherwise until they banned it last year.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t want to be missing out on say, a cheap easy source of of 4-MEC or something like that. Any ideas?

				There is a good chance it is 6-APB which is still legal in most places.&nbsp; I have never tried it but from what I hear it does closely mimic MDMA.

				the only way to tell is to reagent test. but i wouldn&#039;t buy those pills man. there could be a whole slew of nasty poorly synthesized research chemicals. stay far away if you ask me

As far as I can tell, the only really sure way would be to send it off to a chemical analysis lab and have them tell me exactly what&#039;s in it.

				I decided to take it (last night) and as far as I could tell, it was just methylone. I&#039;ve never tried 6-APB, but from the (limited) reports at Erowid, it was nothing like that. That shop openly sells meth pipes, salvia, and synthetic weed, so it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if they just had leftover methylone and decided to sell it anyway since it&#039;s not actually labeled.
