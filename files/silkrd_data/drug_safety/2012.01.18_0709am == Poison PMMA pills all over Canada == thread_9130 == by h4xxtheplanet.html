				http://www.theprovince.com/health/Calgary+patients+died+after+ecstasy+overdose+extreme+symptoms/6003725/story.html<br /><br />This is why I only ever buy MDMA crystalline powder I can test on the spot to make sure it&#039;s real.<br />Wow these idiots took 7-8 pills all at once. Who does that. <br /><br />So far 5 kids dead and 3 adults in a month from PMMA poisoning from taking shitty fake X pills. <br />Buy real mdma powder and make your own capsules :) Don&#039;t take 7 of them. Of course police blaming everything on Ecstasy and not blaming themselves for fighting self lab testing facilities when they tried to open here to combat PMMA junk like they have in Europe where you can bring in street pills and confirm there&#039;s no PMMA or shit in them without being arrested.<br />

				Don&#039;t take 7 is good advice, but as someone who has taken way more than that many times, it&#039;s not gonna cut it.<br /><br />This is an utter tragedy.<br /><br />If ever there was an argument for softening or regulation, this has got to be it.<br /><br />at the very least, some kind of testing facility as per the Netherlands. My impression of Canada is that it&#039;s a fairly sensible Administration - is it worth campaigning for the ability for anonymous testing of pills on the back of this?

				That is really terrible to hear, and will definitely demonize Ecstasy/MDMA more than it already is. But... 7 pills of ANYTHING is usually not a good idea.<br /><br />There really needs to be more public awareness for these drugs. I can&#039;t see them getting legalized and regulated anytime soon, but at the very least, someone should make a public service announcement or something to promote Ecstasy safety, because regardless of whether or not E ever becomes legal, someone, somewhere will try it, and if they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing... something like this will happen again.
