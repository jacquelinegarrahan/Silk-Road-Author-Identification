				There have been a handful of studies that suggest Ketamine can at least for a while, cure depression.&nbsp; The intriguing part:<br /><br />- It&#039;s supposedly _fast_, like 2 hours compared to 6 weeks for Prozac or conventional stuff<br />- Works on major depression, when other meds would not help.<br /><br />Can anyone speak from experience about this?<br />

				There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that ketamine cures depression. However, anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that it does. Studies are being done, with promising results so far.<br /><br />And like wowzers said, it can&#039;t hurt to try. Ketamine is a relatively harmless drug, especially if the idea is to take only one or a few doses (any ill effects only really appear on extremely high doses or with repeated use over long periods of time.<br /><br />My advice to you is that you should try it. There&#039;s a good chance it&#039;ll help you. And the worst case scenario is that you&#039;ll just have a fun out-of-body experience for about ninety minutes instead. So, where&#039;s the downside?

It&#039;s the number one animal anesthetic, and in human surgery where the patients have a risk of lung failure, it&#039;s used preferentially over other anesthetics and sedatives, because it&#039;s one of the few drugs that can cut off pain signals without depressing the respiratory system as a side-effect.<br /><br />Based on the same Erowid tables linked above, the normal anesthetic dose of ketamine administered via intramuscular injection is 66.67% larger than the k-hole dose, which is slightly below the top limit of recreational dosing (in practice, people use a bit more due to tolerance build-up).

				Most of the Ketamine-depression studies out there involve intramuscular delivery. I&#039;ve snorted K before when I was depressed and it definitely did something to clear up my mind, although the effects were short lived (longer than the drug itself but not more than a day or two). A friend just tried some via IM injection like in the studies, and he absolutely loved it. It&#039;s been a few days now and he still doesn&#039;t feel the depression returning. Like everything else in this yet unproven field, your mileage may vary...

				subjectively: yes, and i would list a minimum effective dose at about a point. but that&#039;s just me...<br /><br />also, i was on an SNRI for a little bit, and i would describe the effects as &quot;some bad e&quot;, as that&#039;s exactly how i felt when i was on it. it was like i was rolling, except not, and felt much more gross :S

				Cure? No. Treat? Yes.<br /><br />Low dose ketamine seems to keep people from getting depressed for a few days, but you need to keep taking it. MXE has the same effect but it lasts longer and thus you have to take it less often.

				No drug will &#039;cure&#039; depression.&nbsp; You learn to deal with depression through therapy, retraining your brain, a lot of hard work.<br /><br />That being said, I suffer from borderline personality disorder, anxiety and panic disorder, severe depression, and bulimia.&nbsp; Ketamine has helped me immensely.&nbsp; I find that if I do it once every two weeks or so (like a half b or so) that it really helps knock out suicidal thoughts.&nbsp; It&#039;s also very useful when I have panic attacks or feel like self-harming, it calms me right down.&nbsp; It&#039;s more effective than ativan/lorazepam for me in terms of fast acting medications.&nbsp; I also have trouble sleeping and I find k helps with that as well.&nbsp; I know they are doing some studies in the UK now using ketamine as an antidepressant, when results are published I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll wind up on here.&nbsp; As a long term user though I must say, please make sure you take care of your nose!&nbsp; It can tear it up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never shot it up nor do I really plan to.

				If you&#039;re trying to curb your depression I must recommend MXE.&nbsp; MXE is the depression wonder drug.&nbsp; I went through my K purchase and it was cool but it seems like you need double the amount of K to get the same effect of MXE.&nbsp; And MXE is cheaper so it makes sense to go with the MXE.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on depression drugs (everything that&#039;s out there) since 1996 and have stopped taking them about 9 days ago because they don&#039;t work and MXE does.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even have any of the AWFUL withdrawal effects that I usually got if I missed taking my depression medicine cocktail.&nbsp; <br /><br />*In saying all that I&#039;m not advocating that people stop taking their meds.&nbsp; It was a personal choice for me and I honestly have never felt better.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I can&#039;t WAIT...until Psychiatrists actually to Clinical Trials.....we&#039;ll see, but I&#039;ve heard the same as you have (just different duration).

				Ever since I started using MXE my depression and anxiety has dissipated. It&#039;s like I can&#039;t think negative thoughts anymore. I can try, but it doesn&#039;t bother me like it used to. I like to use the word content rather than happy.

I suppose eventually it will fade away, too. That might be the last push I need to finally try some MXE. ;)

				I&#039;ve been using ketamine as an alternative treatment to SSRIs since July last year and it works for me. <br /><br />Some observations I&#039;d like to share for others considering this:<br /><br />- I had been on Lexapro 10mg/day from April 2008 until September 2011. There was a period of concurrent use of ketamine and the Lexapro for about a two months, but then I went travelling and forgot to take the Lexapro with me. On previous occasions where I had gone two or three days without the Lexapro I would get symptoms of SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (mainly brain-shocks). This time, they were completely absent so I basically when cold turkey off the Lexapro from then on. I&#039;m not say the ketamine is the reason for this, but it is an interesting co-incidence that needs more investigation.<br /><br />- I only administer ketamine via IM injection. My typical dosages vary between 0.5mg/kg of body-weight and 1.25 mg/kg of body-weight. Within this range, the dosage has (for me) no effect on the efficacy or duration of the anti-depressive effect. However, I find with the low dosages it is felt sooner because there is less of a ketamine &quot;hang-over&quot; that needs to dissipate.&nbsp; For someone interested in using this substance purely for its anti-depressant properties, a low dose would be preferable.<br /><br />- The effects last about two weeks. I treat myself once a week to maintain efficacy.<br /><br />- For a two month period during November and December I had no access to ketamine due to being scammed by a vendor here (thanks serious_sam). After two weeks, I began to feel depression creeping back and over the next six weeks it got progressively worse (remember I was off SSRIs now) up to the point where my state of mind was at a pre-SSRI low after Christmas. Fortunately Dr Amsterdam came through for me just before New Year with a new supply (I can recommend this vendor for both speed of service and purity of product).<br /><br />- Immediately after getting re-supplied and commencing treatment, I was back feeling normal again. <br /><br />- Compared to the SSRI I was on, I find ketamine a much nicer anti-depressant because it has fewer side effects, only needs to be taken once a week and allows a greater range of emotions. The SSRI had me range bound within a really narrow emotional plateau. I couldn&#039;t feel sadness or get really happy about something. Also, I had become very apathetic about life. Comfortably Numb would be an apt phrase to describe my mental condition after three years on Lexapro.&nbsp; Ketamine lets me feel sad, I can cry when appropriate, and feel joy when appropriate. But it keeps me at a very normal baseline. The apathy has also disappeared and I feel more motivated and interested in life again.<br /><br />For now I&#039;m just grateful for this substance and hope that it works as a long term treatment to a chronic condition. It is not a one-time miracle cure, as I need to keep on using it. But I needed to take SSRIs chronically as well, so not much difference there. I still have the underlying depression, as my &quot;holiday&quot; from ketamine showed, but it is under control and I am getting on with my life.<br />

We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe someone with access to academic journals can post the full text of that article?

				In NYC the New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center was actually doing a study to see if Ketamine can be used for an Anti-Depressant.

				Dr Amsterdam is my current vendor of choice. He ships out of the Netherlands though. Perhaps ask him what his success rate is getting material into the US. Canada seems like a good option if you are in the US.<br /><br />On SR, ketamine is generally sold in powder form because it is cheaper and easier to conceal than vials of liquid. Powder is easily snorted, but if you want to inject it is really simple to dissolve it in some saline solution. <br /><br />What I usually do is measure out 9ml of saline per gram that I want to dissolve into a glass that has been sterilized. I heat the water for a couple of seconds in the microwave (makes things dissolve faster, although clean K is very soluble). Then I add the powder, stir until it dissolves and draw into a syringe. I then top up the syringe with saline to the closest multiple of 10ml. This way, 1ml = 100mg. I keep the solution in this syringe and decant the smaller amounts I want to inject into a smaller syringe when I am ready to use it.

I&#039;ve seen suggested treatment protocols of 0.3mg/kg bodyweigh every third day. That was for IV administration, but should work for IM as well.

They were using IV in the clinical trials because a) the duration is shorter and b) it was being administered by a medical professional. Recreational users who inject do so via IM, don&#039;t know how you feel about doing that. Personally I find it cleaner than snorting, the onset is faster (but 2 minutes so you have time to finish the injection and put the needle away safely and lie down), also, IM uses less material. Also, because the material is dissolved in a liquid it is simple to get exact quantities without a scale. There is a stick thread at the top of the forum on proper IM technique if you are interested (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2072.0).<br /><br />For measuring out doses for snorting without a scale, well, you can either eyeball or divide your gram in half and half again. That will give you four piles of 250mg each. Divvy these in half again if you want 125mg. <br /><br />And yes, at the quantities you are using, eyeballing is safe. Even full anesthetic doses are safe (ket was introduced as a battlefield anesthetic which could be administered without the need for an dedicated anesthetist) and for recreational use you are using far less than that. Obviously you need to be in a safe environment and not driving because the dissociative effects cause you to lose motor control of your muscles. Personally, I like to lie down and close my eyes after injecting, and listen to music for an hour or so.&nbsp;

				Yes, that&#039;s true. I believe it was something like every 3rd day. I can&#039;t actually remember if it was IM or IV. Most likely IV. But yes, A very small amount. an amount you wouldn&#039;t even feel.<br />But if you&#039;re new to k and want to start small. I&#039;d suggest doing key bumps. That&#039;s a pretty safe way to get as little as possible yet feel some of the high the correct way, and then you are able to judge for yourself if you want to take another one or way. But in the beginning, doing key bump are a safe way to dose IMO. Then when you get the hang of how much your taste requires, then you&#039;ll be able to eyeball the amount you like and just make it into lines.

				I kind of work in the area of helping people with depression. Its a real nasty illness is depression but there are people who care out there and its not like it used to be. People are more accepting now.<br /><br />As for Ketamine I have followed the various trials and looked into this matter. I was interested in Blaq Peters comments and thank him for being so honest and so descriptive. In fact thanks to all here debating the matter. Anything that can help depression is a Godsend and people self medicate on all manner of things. They also have many other things that help to tackle depression - ways of helping yourself. Diet, lifestyle, friends, family and relationships. Some depression is due to things that happened and other times it just happens to you for no reason. Life may be fine and then its not.<br /><br />Well Ketamine might well be a good thing and I am following Blaq Peters medical usage with interest. SSRIs are hit or miss. Trouble us they take weeks to hit or miss. Imagine buying cannabis which might work in a few weeks after consuming? Seems wrong that people with depression do not have a drug which works NOW.<br /><br />Well some drugs do work now as in right away. Speed, heroin, cocaine, I am sure anyone with depression would feel better on one of those. But that way of defeating depression is a way to open up more troubles in the form of being an addict just for the sake of overcoming depression.<br /><br />Ketamine is not a daily drug I take it. Not used it myself. Not sure if its my thing as I am a big smoker of the hash and weed. But using once a week - I think most would ingest it orally. I&#039;m intrigued as to how people feel when using it and this &#039;afterglow&#039;. But I am more interested by Blaq Peter and wonder how bad was the depression you had? On a scale of 1 to 10 - were 10 is basically someone who has planned suicide. I&#039;ve been a 10 myself bro. Don&#039;t mind saying it myself. But things are good now.<br /><br />I thank those who take the time and trouble to inform others about how they tackle depression.<br /><br />As well as ketamine do you live a healthy life when not using? Are things ok for you right now would you say? I hope so man. And to anyone out there with depression do talk to people about it. Don&#039;t isolate yourself and self med with drugs that &#039;work&#039; until you stop using. We all have the choice to use what we want and I have no problems there. I know many use heroin due to depression. It was a drug that made them feel comfortable for the first time for years. We have many in the UK on pure morphine due to medical reasons. They seem fairly perky and function 100% in their daily lives. <br /><br />This ketamine thread is a good one. I will keep looking in.<br /><br />My best to anyone out there in our little virtual community of fellow travelers on the road less traveled.

Like you say, they take ages to work, and even if they do manage to lift the depression they leave you as something less than what you were before the depression started, an emotionally empty husk. Add to their vague efficiency the negative side effects such as weight gain, loss of libido and anhedonia; and the fact that you become physically addicted to them (SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome is just a fancy way of saying withdrawal symptoms from substance dependence) and suddenly they don&#039;t seem that great. Even the&nbsp; tricyclics (TCAs) I&#039;ve tried are subjectively better and more effective than SSRIs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10503.msg170232#msg170232">Quote from: redalloverthelandguyhere on March 30, 2012, 11:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Ketamine is not a daily drug I take it.

I lived for the few precious moments of consciousness after I woke up and before I remembered who and where I was and what awaited me. I was diagnosed with depression and general anxiety disorder and then started the meds. I had not planned a suicide but I had considered it. 8/10? I think things could&#039;ve gotten worse.<br /><br />I distinctly remember popping my first Xanax and feeling the weight of the world slip away, and suddenly it felt quiet around me as if I had been listening to white noise 24/7 for the past year. I guess that is what the ketamine &quot;afterglow&quot; feels like: its not an afterglow like one would get from mushrooms, which is normal+feels good mam. A week after ketamine is a return to absolute normality and peace where you can get on with your life and feel happy or sad as you want to when you should. It doesn&#039;t feel like you are on anything (because, you aren&#039;t, its out of the system in about 12 hours) and you don&#039;t feel up or euphoric for no reason, but you can easily get there. On the other end of the scale, I can feel sad again. A friend was murdered in a violent crime in February and I was able to grieve properly, which SSRIs would have made impossible. I had a good cry and reflected on the fragile nature of life, but at no time was I down and feeling overwhelmed by the situation (like I would have been with depression).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10503.msg170232#msg170232">Quote from: redalloverthelandguyhere on March 30, 2012, 11:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />As well as ketamine do you live a healthy life when not using?

				I remember hearing about this on NPR a few weeks ago. Very interesting stuff, eh? :-)<br /><br />Evidently, Ketamine is useful for depression in that it blocks the excess secretion of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter and the presence of too much is believed to be neuro-toxic and perhaps the cause of depression for many. This is casting doubt on the exclusivity of the serotonin-deficient model of depression that has predominated in psychiatry over the last couple decades. And I&#039;m not surprised. I&#039;ve always figured the mechanisms behind depression are not singular for the entire depressed population: there are several neurotransmitters at play here and that&#039;s the reason depression is so difficult to treat. <br /><br />As someone who has been on SSRIs for depression in the past, I can tell you there is a portion of patients for whom SSRIs of ANY brand will simply not work. I&#039;m actually quite interested in Ketamine for the treatment of my own ongoing mild depression. I have my suspicions about MXE, however: sure, it&#039;s similar structurally but lacks the history, research and anecdotal evidence to back it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Does anyone know of a reputable domestic (USA) Ketamine vendor here on SR? PM me if so. All this talk has renewed my interest in trying out K for my own symptoms. May make it my next order!

				I think this is the study a lot of you are referring to; <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21557878<br />IV 0.2 mg/kg over 1-2min and then followed for 10 days showed ketamine effective for the treatment<br />of suicide ideation in an ER setting.<br /><br />Ketamine is also found to work in depressed patients - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10686270<br /><br />I think this is the best study to date; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15500598<br />It found schizotypal and perceptual distortions persist after ketamine use.<br /><br />I think if you find ketamine works for your depression you should see if you can get some Namenda - it&#039;s an NMDA receptor antagonist - just like ketamine - and the side effect profile is a bit better if your going to be taking something regularly.

				I&#039;m a 30 yo man, tried many mind altering substances like lsd, shrooms, 2cs, thc, DMT, alcohol, ketamine.... and this substance is REALLY helping me to treat a severe depression and break downs that seemed to have grown and aged with me.<br /><br />I found it useful as a &quot;1&quot; shot dose (0.33g) once in a week, passing this dose can worsen the depression and get you in more troubles of addiction. (Don&#039;t do it in frequent small bumps)<br />And absolutely its not a rave drug, its a treatment, turn off ur mobile phone, do it in calm place, laying on ur bed or something comfortable.<br /><br />your mood will be up lifted for at least 4 days after the entrance of the k-hole.<br /><br />anyways, its not a cure its just a periodic treatment.<br />real cure must be applied on our fucked up society.

				when i get to an ending road with Ketamine, ill experience the MXE... but for me, K is working fine.<br /><br />after 1 Year of using K, i developed my own image on depression, its like a large gravitational hole. always thirsty and need to swallow all the submitted feelings and ideas in my mind, and left me in the void, sober, detached from reality, unable to complete the tasks i already started, no feelings, nothing interested. just bored and unhappy. fuck it its like being almost dead.<br /><br />the K trip FEED this hole very well with some PROFOUND understanding of this world, its like this depression hole is always asking for deep and profound ideas so it can cool down for a period of time.<br /><br />now i&#039;m trying to look for a solution away from sniffing K, i think learning to play music or make some pretty professional drawings, or maybe doing some interesting research on some aspects of life, will help me feed this hole the same way that K does.<br /><br />and yes, better to reduce the dosage gradually over a period of time.

				It is amazing stuff. Even 10-20mg IM, not enough to even feel loopy and the next few days you&#039;ll feel like a million bucks. Most depression meds take weeks to start working, if they do, or they make things worse. K always works when used sparingly. If you use it every day it doesn&#039;t work anymore..<br /><br />Higher doses don&#039;t really seem to make that feeling any stronger.

				I suffer from bipolar II and I take lamotrigine daily as a mood stabilizer. I also take a complex multivitamin and some other vitamin supplements, as well as fish oil and 5-htp daily to boost my mood. My regimen works, although I can&#039;t tell you which of these is most key. I would also not want to list everything in my multivitamin but it includes a lot of amino acids, which are definitely important to the regimen.<br /><br />I found that both ketamine and MXE, as well as 3-MeO-PCP, have been good mood boosters. However, the effects are temporary, and as tolerance climbs so does the effect&#039;s duration dwindle.<br /><br />I find the best routes of administration for therapeutic effects of these drugs are intramuscular injection for ketamine, sublingual or buccal administration for MXE, and insufflation for 3-MeO-PCP.<br /><br />If I want to achieve antidepressant effects, I would usually take a fairly large dose of ketamine instramuscularly and listen to calming music or engage in friendly conversation with close friends for the duration of the experience, about once a week. Meditation or contemplation is quite helpful.<br /><br />With MXE I would take a medium-small dose buccally in the morning, and a very tiny dose buccally in the afternoon. MXE is stimulating, so I would keep my dose at least 4 hours away from bedtime. I would do this daily 5/7 days of the week (usually Monday through Friday). This is more likely to build tolerance, so vacations once in a while might be a good idea.<br /><br />With 3-MeO-PCP I would take a very large dose once every few weeks, and spend the entire trip listening to intricate and chaotic music, and talking to myself about my issues, alone. I found that I need to be disturbed, not comforted, to take advantage of the therapeutic effects of this drug. Although the most troubling of the three it&#039;s also the most rewarding.<br /><br />In general, though, MXE is a good bet for most. It&#039;s inexpensive and it works quite well.<br /><br />Again, not a cure, but a treatment.
