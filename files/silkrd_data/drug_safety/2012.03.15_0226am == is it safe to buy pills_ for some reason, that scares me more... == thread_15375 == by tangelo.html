				I&#039;ve had great experiences on SR, but I just purchased pills for the first time (Percocet).<br /><br />For some reason, I&#039;m finding myself really nervous about trying them. They are plain white pills, no markings, a score down the center. I would feel better if they had more markings. The fact that they don&#039;t is making me worry --- is it really safe to take a pill sent to me in the mail from a stranger?<br /><br />Is there anything I can do to up the safety here?

				If the vendor is established on SR &amp; the forums, then you are 99.9% good to go.<br /><br />It is no worse than buying pills off the street or from a friend. <br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: What percocet has NO markings other than a score? Can&#039;t be made in the US?

				who did you get pills from without markings? that seems very sketch! <br /><br />all the pills on SR Ive seen have just been legit pharms with the correct identification. they have all been of a quality as expected and safe.<br /><br />i wouldnt think hopefully that there is anything dangerous in the pills, if anything its probably just filler not something poisonous although they may not be active or they may contain an active ingredient that is a related opioid or something... hopefully it really is oxycodone. maybe they made their own pills but who knows then about the dosage.<br /><br />did you already finalize? i would have been expecting something different, but would at least try like a quarter pill, then a bit more if not negative effects up to a full dose and see if it is an opiate at least. if it is not, i would go into resolution and at least get SR input on the situation. <br /><br />Good luck, hope they are legit!

				pills should cause the absolute least amount of paranoia.<br /><br />especially - *especially* - if purchased from an established vender<br /><br /><br />so with that said, if you only ordered something like twenty pills; bought from a notoriously reliable and established vender, and are *still* paranoid, then you may want to step back, take a deep breath and think for moment about what it is that actually goes on here at the Road. Silk Road may not be the place for you - since, there is always a chance of being ripped off. always. <br /><br />just sayin

				but Habitat, I think you may be missing the point its not just that these pills are from some anonymous online source, no matter how reputable the vendor. <br /><br />The point is that these pills do not have the imprints that are characteristic of ALL prescription medication... which is obviously not normal or common to SR in my experience. I would be nervous too if I received pills I could not identify! Would you not be cautious if you had no clue what pills you received? Even the best vendor can accidentally send the wrong product.<br /><br />I just dont understand it seems you are almost commenting on an unwarranted sense of &quot;paranoia&quot; which is unnecessary. Imo the OPs hesitation is completely reasonable and the correct approach even since he was unable to accurately determine the pills composition. If the user wants to post a safety question in the drug safety category I do not think they should be discouraged. <br /><br />I did find a list of all the oxycodone pills I have ever encountered, plus many... and I did not notice ANY oxycodone pills that were white and only scored without another imprint. That is why I would question how legitimate the product is, but perhaps this is a US only list?&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.thatspoppycock.com/imprints/oxycodone/<br /><br />Good luck, Be safe<br />- miR
