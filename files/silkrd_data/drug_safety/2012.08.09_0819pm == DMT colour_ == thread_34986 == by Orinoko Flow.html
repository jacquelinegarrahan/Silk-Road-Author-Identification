Not too many vendors for it in the UK, but buying from Europe shouldn&#039;t be to big of an issue.

				Yes, the white DMT is pure DMT. There is most definitely other colors for DMT, though. White is definitely not the &quot;best&quot; by any means though. Some people prefer it, others don&#039;t. I personally prefer the &quot;JimJam DMT&quot; Which is a mix of all the different types of DMT located in MHRB.<br /><br />White DMT - Pure N-N,DMT<br />Red &quot;Jungle&quot; DMT - Mostly 95% DMT. Some people believe that it has different effects than that of White DMT.<br />Yellow DMT - DMT-N-oxide. May be 1/3 or less potent than White DMT or Jungle DMT when smoked. (some think it is a mix of the Jungle DMT and White DMT, hence it&#039;s yellow).<br />JimJam DMT - The full spectrum product. This is everything extracted from MHRB.

This is a major factor in how it ends up as when DMT becomes too dense in a solution it crashes out into a red oil which you can dry into waxy crystals, which people call &quot;jungle dmt&quot;, which guess what, is exactly like white/yellow dmt except because of its density it tends not to smoke as easily. This is easily remedied by taking a small sample of the red crystal and mixing it into a warm solution of naphtha and letting it sit at room temp for 24-48 hours, yellow crystals will naturally begin to form on the sides of the container. If you&#039;re really impatient you can stick it in the freezer which will give you a &quot;white crystal powder&quot; which is exactly the same as yellow and red dmt except its less dense! Yes, the coloration you see is largely to do with its density. The major reason you see red pigment to begin with at higher densities is that DMT is extracted from mimosa hostilis rootbark which produces a very deep red dye, so some of that helps color the crystal. <br /><br />I dont know much about 5-meo except you cant extract it from anything safely, leaving you with colorado river toads (endangered) or synthesis. <br /><br />

				What up everyone. Kinda new here but I thought I could shed some light on this particular subject. DMT generally is made by extracting from a variety of different plants. I have personally extracted DMT myself several times, successfully. Mine was always a very light yellow for the first couple pulls, then the next few get a little bit darker because more plant oils are extracted along with the DMT. This doesn&#039;t necessarily weaken it or make it any worse in at all. On the other hand, if it is more orange than yellow, then it&#039;s more likely to be DMT-N-oxide, which still gives a very similar effect. Most of the time if you get some that is clear or white, it either means a more advanced extraction was used OR they did a very simple extraction like myself, and then recrystallized to purify it. I know the first time I made it, it was basically like a powder consistency, but sparkly. Then the second time I recrystallized and it was much clearer and looked more like meth. Bottom line: white, clear, or light yellow is what you want.

				DMT colour can NEVER tell you the purity!<br /><br />How many of you have done any lab test to test your claims?<br />1% impurity can cause a COMPLETE colour change. White means nothing, have you ever seen granulated lye? <br />Stop perpetuating this fallacy, please. If you feel like your spice is safe to smoke, that is all you need. Potency varies VERY little, if any. I&#039;m sure none of you could tell the difference in a double-blind test between different colour extracts.

If you use Naptha, it will only leave a pure product, which is the White DMT. You would then have to perform pulls of something else to get the other &quot;types&quot; of DMT.. Its all purity. &quot;Some&quot; people say the effects are different. Go do some research at DMT nexus. I personally don&#039;t notice.<br /><br />If my information is false, then why not please enlighten me without a wall of text and with some decency next time?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You extract with xylene then? This is the guaranteed way of getting oils/waxes in your final product. I did this once, and even though i did a few defats initially it still left me with this viscous crap which i had no way of removing., naphtha wouldnt even touch it, and naphtha will not leave white dmt, only very fluffy dmt will appear white and will become yellow to red depending on its volume/purity if you melt it.<br /><br />Your info is misinformed, do some tests yourself before jumping to conclusions. Recrystalizations are done under the assumption that impurities will make it into the solvent which you can then discard. The reason you&#039;re getting grades of dmt might be due to the fact that you arent recrystalizing (which can only be done with naphtha btw, hence why its wise to use naphtha to begin with) or are reusing the solvent which is accumulating impurities. As for the claim of oxidation, it could very well be just the density of crystals building up (and the resulting trace color) if you like to keep adding your solvents to your vap dish like i do. If it were oxidized DMT then it would notably not just convert back into yellow crystal dmt upon rextal&#039;s and remain an oxidized red goo. <br /><br />No offense but i dont like people spouting speculation as fact when they themselves havent done some basic tests to determine what something might be. I went through too many failures listening to bad advice to stand by and let people spew it unchecked. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I stopped reading when I read recrystaizing could only be done with naptha. Everyone knows hexane is the proper recrystalization solvent.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />naphtha is a collection of higher grade (short-chain) hydrocarbons, hexane is just one of those grades. most people dont have access to hexane.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bestine brand cement remover can be found at almost any hobby store.

Really, no joke.<br />Just remember to take the right precautions (Goggles/Safety glasses, long sleeves, gloves, use only glass/HDPE 2, etc) and study LOTS. It has been said before, DMT-Nexus has literally all the information you will ever need to know about DMT.
