				This weekend I&#039;m going to be taking LSD for the first time, and I plan to do a candy flip. I&#039;m a little uncertain about how I should do this. I can&#039;t seem to find a straight answer on how long an LSD trip lasts, I&#039;ve heard numbers between 6 hours and an entire day. <br /><br />Can anyone with some experience tell me how far into the trip I should take the MDMA? I&#039;m not really sure how many (100ug) hits I should take either. I&#039;m very experienced with mushrooms already and I&#039;m accustomed to taking extremely heavy doses.

				I would eat the mdma around 60-90 minutes after eating the lsd.&nbsp; The L lasts a bit longer (8 hours in my experiences) so this will make them blend nice together.&nbsp; I would recomend 100 ug to a first timer but if you do take a heavier dose of shrooms then go for 200-300 ug as it will be way more visual.&nbsp; I would also eat less mdma than usual as lsd is a lot like rolling and has a huge buzz of its own.

				Take 2.5 or 3 of the 100ug tabs, then just after the peak has passed, generally at the 4th or 5th hour, drop 100-125ug of MDMA. You&#039;ll lose the revelatory nature of the trip, as well as any menace, but all the pores of the world that the LSD opened will now be oozing love at you and you&#039;ll see why they call it &#039;candyflipping&#039; because everything will look like it&#039;s made of glowing gumdrops. Under the LSD microscope, the MDMA come-up can feel a bit cloying and smothering, but once you&#039;re in it&#039;s marvelous.

				Will 300ug give me plenty in the way of visuals? I&#039;m not really looking to just feel extremely euphoric, I want to have a seriously hallucinogenic experience.

				Generally speaking, a nominal 300ug dose should give you sustained and pronounced visuals. Nominal 300ug doses on all the LSD I&#039;ve bought from SR in the last year have given me visuals for 8 hours, on average, with intensity and character varying from batch to batch but always present. Different batches of acid have distinctly different &quot;signatures&quot; with respect to the distribution of effects across the visual, mental, and somatic spectrum as well as developing along different trajectories. Sometimes it&#039;s a steep climb during the comeup with an intense peak then a short plateau followed by a correspondingly steep drop to baseline. Other times the transition is slow and leisurely. With the candyflip you want the MDMA to hit once the trip has leveled off mentally but the visuals are still going strong and avoid being still spun by the LSD during the MDMA comedown, which is why people typically advise the MDMA at around the 4 hour mark so everything is back to baseline by hour 8 or 9. Adjust accordingly.

				Thanks a lot. Now when you say to wait until the LSD has &quot;leveled off mentally&quot;.., will I know what you are talking about when it happens? My fear is that I&#039;ll end up taking the MDMA too late into the trip.

				My advice would be, don&#039;t candyflip your first time tripping. Have you done MDMA? You should not introduce yourself to both these powerful substances at the same time, straight up.&nbsp; I have candy flipped, and it was overwhelming, and I love both those respective drugs on their own. But together, not to say they aren&#039;t great but its just, you are going to be sooo fucked up, you need to realize what you are getting into. I was overwhelmed, and I had done plenty of drugs.<br /><br />Depending on the setting, you should probably take one or the other.&nbsp; And then work your way up to candyflip, cause it is super cool.&nbsp; But like I said, I was overwhelmed the first time&nbsp; I did it and I had done acid like 4-5 times and MDMA like 8-10 times...

				I candyflipped during my first LSD trip. I had only done MDMA four times, and had no previous experience with other psychedelics.&nbsp; I ingested about 100ug of LSD, and roughly an hour later took a strong dosage of MDMA.&nbsp; It was a good experience overall, although there were moments in which it seemed like it was about to get too intense, but these quickly passed. It is certainly possible to get overwhelmed,&nbsp; so if I were you I&#039;d try LSD on its own first. Plus, at least for me, LSD by itself gives better visuals than candyflipping.

				Oh, sorry I should have been clearer. I&#039;ve done MDMA plenty of times, just never LSD. My way of thinking is that if you aren&#039;t supposed to take the MDMA until a few hours into the experience, I&#039;ll get a chance to see what LSD by itself is like regardless, and of course can always decide not to take the MDMA if I have a change of heart

Your first acid trip, you should just take acid. Its absolutely amazing on its own. But yeah at least definitely don&#039;t take it all at once if you are determined to do that combo.

				Like I said, I may well have a change of heart and not take MDMA, but I&#039;ll make that decision when the time comes.

				Just an update in case anyone gives a shit. LSD is my new favorite substance. <br /><br />Also you guys ought to be more open minded, I ended up doing a candy flip and it was one of the greatest decisions I&#039;ve ever made. Perfect synergy

				Glad to read that you enjoyed your experience with LSD.&nbsp; Have you done it alone yet?&nbsp; Not that I didn&#039;t use to enjoy &quot;candy flipping&quot; but I guess I just kinda grew out of the MDMA.&nbsp; It feels like forced euphoria to me so if that&#039;s what you&#039;re going for then by all means.&nbsp; LSD feels more to me like a tool than a recreational substance.&nbsp; Although it is great fun hehe
