				I think it would be nice to have a list of products which can be snorted, or not, and why. Or what works best.<br /><br />For example: some people think snorting valium gives a stronger effect. But actually this can not possibly be true. Rather the opposite.<br /><br />Mdma can be snorted, but it burns a lot and am unsure about faster onset/duration.<br />XTC/E pills... thought that was possible, until cleaning of nose and then seeing the exact color of the pill back, perhaps even the same amount...<br /><br />So, what works, what doesn&#039;t? What&#039;s different? What&#039;s best? etc.<br /><br />Advicccceee awayyyy!

				I&#039;ll give it a go:<br /><br />MDMA - Oral - Insufflated - Rectal - IV<br /><br />Oral dosing is the most common ROA followed by insufflation then plugging and vary rarely IV. Most ROA&#039;s use a dose range of 100-150mg but the &quot;recommended&quot; dosing guidelines are at 1.5mg/1kg. In my experience oral administration is effective but the onset and effect varies greatly based on last meal composition as well as stomach acid makeup. Taking it on an empty stomach about 15-20 minutes after eating some Tums seems to help even things out. <br /><br />Insufflation&nbsp; is fairly common as well, tends to hit a little faster / harder but the effects seem to diminish quicker and good MDMA really doesn&#039;t have a pleasant taste or drip. Many people will take a regular dose orally and then insufflate a smaller dose to get a quicker come up. The does range for insufflation is similar to oral. <br /><br />Rectal (aka Plugging) is my favorite ROA just because it is one of the few that requires a lower dose (80-120mg vs. 100-150mg as a starting point in my experience), provides a quick come up somewhere between oral and nasal but does not decrease roll time in my experience. Typically I use an oral syringe, mix Molly powder with about 3-4ml water, wait for it to dissolve&nbsp; and then administer.<br /><br />IV is not a very common ROA for Molly but there are some people that have reported great results with it. The dosing seems to go down another notch thanks to the increased availability so if 100-150mg was the oral baseline dose than 50-75mg would be closer to the IV baseline dose. No personal experience with this so I would suggest insane research and a clean supply before even thinking about it. The high is obviously reported as more intense and predictably shorter. <br /><br />MDA - Oral - Insufflated - Rectal - IV<br /><br />All of the same information from MDMA should be transferable to MDA with the exception that the dosing in my experience is about 20% lower for MDA vs MDMA so for out 100-150mg base dose of MDMA we would be looking at about 80-120mg for MDA.<br /><br />I might do another one up for 2CB since I recently started playing with that but I want to test dosage a little bit more as 2CB is used in such small quantities and the active range seems to be pretty wide from 5mg to 50mg depending on the person taking it. <br />

				I&#039;m a complete n00b at the rectal and iv part...<br /><br />You just insert the syringe and inject it and it stays there?<br /><br /><br />For mdma I would suggest putting it into a capsule. Snorting it is nice if you like snorting. But your nose does not like it so much.<br /><br /><br />Benzo&#039;s can be mixed with liquids. I&#039;m not aware of any dissolutions (yet). I do know that valium mixes pretty good with fatty stuff like milk.<br /><br />Regarding 2cb: tried snorting it a few times. But it was so painful that I was already tripping and wasn&#039;t finished with my dosage yet.<br />Capsules are probably best&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />

Once you get the hang of it you can take the oral syringe right out but the first few times it&#039;s best to leave it in there for a bit until you know how to hold the drug in there. If I was a clubber I would probably just take it orally since that&#039;s pretty darn convenient but since I normally just take drugs with my girl at home getting naked together really isn&#039;t an issue. <br /><br />2CB we normally plug too just because it is SOOO painful to snort and kind of hits like a freight train when you do. Orally the come up is so slow that plugging it seems to be a good happy medium there too.

				DS hit MDMA pretty well--I&#039;d say I&#039;d agree with all that he said. I&#039;m posting to keep an eye on this (I&#039;ll refrain from adding anything right now as my brain is a bit scattered). I will say that benzos, while definitely better to take orally, may have some transmission (and therefore different/faster if not better/more viable effect) when snorted but I&#039;d say it&#039;s something that would be particularly pointless unless you have something free of filler. <br /><br /><br />Another nice project I&#039;d like to see get fleshed out! Good luck! <br />

				If you sniff MDMA, it won&#039;t give you much empathy and you might end up chasing the high all night and go through 0.5g worth.<br />best way is to dissolve in water and chug it back, followed by a sip of soft drink.<br />I&#039;ll be trying some potentiators next time, i&#039;ve&nbsp; heard things about adding bk-MDMA, 6-APB, 5-APB, etc<br /><br />MDMA is absolutely wonderful IV&#039;d.<br />I&#039;m terrified of needles but managed to find a largish vein under my wrist, i&#039;d already taken a small amout orally the stimmed me out enough to be able to do it properly<br />I used around 25mg, pushed slowly. pull out needle then hold vein to stop blood and lift arm to get blood flowing down.<br />It&#039;s like you take a gasp of air as if you&#039;ve been holding your breath for years, as the whole body energises from the 5HT release<br />I tried this with meth after smoking a bit (it gave me the stability and focus needed to do the small procedure)<br />and it&#039;s simmilar, not quite as good but still strong in its own way.<br />other than those two times, I don&#039;t get a desire to IV drugs. I worry about marks on my arms and infections.<br />It&#039;s not really addictive for me, only done it a couple of times but I only do the more neurotoxic ones once every few months(with other routes of administrati

				Tip:<br /><br />Do NOT crush an XTC pill and snort it. Total waste.<br /><br />Some can be dissolved into water. But best to just swallow the pill...<br />
