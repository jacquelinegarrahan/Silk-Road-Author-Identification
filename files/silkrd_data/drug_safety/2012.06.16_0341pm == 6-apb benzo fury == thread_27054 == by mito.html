				6-APB didn&#039;t have anything to do with the Miami zombie, but there was another story about a guy going into a violent psychosis because of it recently, I want to say it was in California but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />It really is hard to say whether these events are actually drug related at all, when a news outlet refers to something as a &quot;more potent form of LSD&quot; you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt. Actually more like several pounds of salt. A little chili powder too.

				6-APB is not a &quot;bath salt&quot; as it is way too rare and expensive be included in the cheap ass bath salts they sell at the store. Very few Chinese Manufacturers sell it as it costs just as much to produce as MDA (which is even more expensive to produce than MDMA). It requires incredibly advanced equipment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27054.msg293402#msg293402">Quote from: l1llykins on June 16, 2012, 05:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27054.msg293357#msg293357">Quote from: blackend646 on June 16, 2012, 04:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&quot;more potent form of LSD&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sub MDA for LSD and it&#039;s still funny and completely ridiculous. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be trying 6-APB tonight (from foxymeow) and post back tomorrow if I don&#039;t end up having a violent psychosis. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please let me know how your free sample is.

I am very excited for 6-APB as it is not included in the upcoming ban as it wasn&#039;t not even on the market until after the bill was written in 2011.

				Alright I survived my 6-apb trip. It&#039;s sort of like MDMA in some ways and sort of like MDA in other ways ... you&#039;ll definitely be rolling but this stuff has its own magic, and not in a zombie kind of way. I&#039;m going to cut and paste my trip report from another thread for all interested. <br /><br />8:00pm - 50mg<br />8:20pm - starting to come up<br />8:30pm - muscles feeling warm in the arms and legs<br />8:37pm - palms sweaty, some nausea, slight visuals ... static things appear to be in motion<br />turned on some music, really enjoying it<br />some jaw tension, start to chew on some gum<br />8:48pm - burst of energy, start to dance<br />9:00pm - dance break to thank foxy<br />9:08pm - threw up, nausea gone, add 6-apb to the list of things I need to preload with drammamine. Back to dancing.<br />9:17pm - Starting to plateau. I&#039;m not rolling as hard as I thought I was going to be, the come-up was just rushing pretty hard and then settled lower than peak. Muscles are still feeling warm and cozy. Really enjoying music and dancing (NOTE: not a dancer and normally avoid it like the plague). I just really like music and my body really wants to dance.<br />9:30pm - I find that instead of being tense, my muscles are actually pretty loose. Stretching is very pleasurable. I decide to relax a bit.<br />10:00pm - I start to notice warm rushes of euphoria flowing through my body and I&#039;m getting aroused. At this point I talk hubby into the bedroom who has been nursing 2.2g of 25d and mostly complaining of cold feet and shivers. By the time we make it to the bed (and to both our surprises), he starts rolling at a +++. And I&#039;m thrown for a loop because it&#039;s his first time rolling like this and I didn&#039;t think it was possible for him to roll this hard, lol.<br />11:00pm - I decide to take some ghb to catch up to him a little. I kind of thought it would just make me more horny but it amplified my rolls and arousal to a ++. It also lengthened my rolls which was very cool. Normally they&#039;re just a few seconds but these rolls seemed to stretch on and on.<br /><br />I think we were going until about 2am. I was still rolling at this point but after lying still for a while I started to doze off due to the ghb.<br /><br />7:30am - I wake up refreshed with a nice afterglow. There is no hangover though I didn&#039;t expect one due to the low dose. There is no jaw or muscle discomfort that I normally get with MDMA and MDA.

It doesn&#039;t fill you with love or joy ... it&#039;s not even infused with any happy like 2c-i. MDMA by itself doesn&#039;t make me energetic. It actually makes me very mellow and I get a lot of muscle and jaw tension. <br /><br />I&#039;d say this is more superficial by itself, a good body high with a clear headspace. The tactile enhancement was more internal rather than on the skin; the skin felt the same intellectually but my body was reacting with pleasure (it&#039;s a new sensation so it&#039;s hard to explain). I remember laughing at myself when I was washing my hands and thinking at the same time, wow this feels the same and wow this feels soooo good! The rolls were also different, euphoria topped with a warm rush. I can&#039;t really say which I liked better. <br /><br />I think this would mix really well with MDMA. Since 6-apb lasts longer (my mdma rolls normally start to fade in about 4 hours without redosing), I can see the mixture have you rolling through the MDMA comedown while the 6-apb ran its course (about 6 hours). Dunno, I&#039;ll have to try it to say for sure. That would probably be an easier load than just taking more 6-apb next time. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27054.msg294582#msg294582">Quote from: mito on June 17, 2012, 03:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27054.msg294557#msg294557">Quote from: l1llykins on June 17, 2012, 03:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />8:00pm - 50mg<br />8:20pm - starting to come up<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ROA?&nbsp; &nbsp;snort or para?<br /><br />nice review, thx!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I dissolved it into some juice and drank it ... doesn&#039;t taste too bad with juice. <br />

				I like 6-APB alot. <br />Used it about 30 times now. Bought mine from a clearnet RC vendor.<br />Since then I have also tried MDMA &amp; MDA a bunch of times.<br /><br />I dont notice any difference from MDA, and I think 6-APB is basicly a bit stronger (better for music) and longer lasting substance than MDMA, with a lil visual touch on the comedown.<br /><br />Personally I prefer 6-APB over MDA or MDMA cos it&#039;s pretty much the same, only cheaper and legal (well, not illegal).<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used 6-APB a bunch of times before I found SR and easy access to to the real deal. It&#039;s not as good as pure MDMA, but its still a lot of fun;<br /><br />I dosed about the same as what I would do for MDMA&nbsp; 0.125 and found it kicked in stronger and harder. Slightly less euphoric but still pretty good. Tended to last longer than MDMA but have a bit rougher comedown.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also the redosing didnt seem to achieve much. Did seem a bit speedier than straight MDMA but not by much.<br /><br />Overall, its no MDMA but still a lot of fun.

				Glad you had a good time Mito. I just can&#039;t see why people like it tbh, I find it so boring and empty. Every time I took it I just felt uncomfortable and regretted taking it and then ended up cracking out the MDMA lol.
