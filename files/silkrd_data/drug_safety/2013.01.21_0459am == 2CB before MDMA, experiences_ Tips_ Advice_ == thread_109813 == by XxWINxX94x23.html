				Fellow community members,<br /><br />Got a sick dubstep show coming up soon and thinking about doing a 2CB + MDMA mix.<br /><br />I have 30mg of nawlins 2-CB and some SuperTrips 120mg Green ?&#039;s.<br /><br />I have consumed the 2-CB at a 25mg dose by itself before and have experienced many traditional psychedelic effects: vibrant colors, patterns in objects appearing to pulse or move, etc. I have done it 2 times before, so I have a little experience.<br /><br />Have not done the ?&#039;s but have been rolling for about a year on and off, so experience in that field too.<br /><br />Now, at this show I want to consume 30mg 2-CB first, then a few hours later 1 or 2 of the ? tabs, based on how I feel. Traditionally, I see many reviews about taking the 2-CB AFTER the MDMA. I wish to do the opposite, because I don&#039;t want to be full out tripping when i come home from the show. Now, unless there is a really bad reason to, maybe if they cancel each other out or something of that sort, I will reconsider the combination.<br /><br />Personally, the desired effect is a somewhat psychedelic roll with stimulation, as I try to envision the combination from taking the substances separate in my previous experiences.<br /><br />So, 30mg 2-CB and then a few hours later 120+mg MDMA, does anyone have any experience or comments on this mix? <br /><br />I would love to hear any advice, trip reports or tips regarding 2-CB THEN MDMA combo.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />&nbsp;

				Ive done what your thinking about, the same dose strength, but with 2c-i.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s a bit different but I did it at a music festival, and it was truly one of the most amazing days of my life.&nbsp; And i&#039;ve candy flipped many a time but this was totally different, clear and defining in my life.&nbsp; Def. space the two apart.&nbsp; When i was on the 2ci i felt like i was meant to add mdma to the mix.&nbsp; Like it was &quot;designed&quot; for that.&nbsp; Well shit, Pretty Lights late night show might have helped in it all but it was honestly amazing.&nbsp;

				Nothing wrong with taking the 2C-B first. It greatly enhances music appreciation. I would take the 2C-B early so that I have a nice trip going throught the show.

				In my experience and that of many others, taking 2C-B before your roll will negate some of the effects of the molly. So, molly first with the 2C-B at about t+2 hrs and enjoy :D

I&#039;ve looked at erowid experience vault but will do some more research on the combo. The ?&#039;s have not been tested, but while I will be taking the 2-CB, some friends will be taking the ?&#039;s and could give me the heads up if for some strange reason they are bunk.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice! I will update this thread with my experience, what I took and how everything went sometime next week after the show.

				I&#039;ve heard of 2C-B after MDMA but not the other way around.&nbsp; Honestly I LOVE taking them at the same time.&nbsp; Keep in mind they both have synergistic effects on one another and they will amplify(by multiplying, not adding) each other&#039;s effects.&nbsp; That said, 125mg MDMA and 17-19mg of 2C-B is BEAUTIFUL and lasts for ~ 6 hours in my experience without any redosing or even desire to, really.

One of the pills got chipped in my ST order, so I&#039;m thinking about throwing the chipped pieces in the 2-CB capsule. They aren&#039;t much/not a full pill, but would probably go well with my heavier 2CB dose.

				That&#039;s a great idea.

				So I tested out said combination and got mixed results. The initial come-up and first hour was pretty cool, lots of weightlessness and buzzing, but after that it started to get pretty mental and intimate. More intimate than I would have liked to been at this event. I was tripping pretty hard off of 30mg and would not recommend that dose for beginners! Eventually, I popped a green ? about 2.5 hours into the 2-CB trip. They ended up fusing together quite well after that. About 3 hours into all this my, my mental state started to be overcome with euphoria, empathy, and energy, all which I get when I roll. 2 hours after that, I popped another Green ?, and this one really got me going. It seems like the rolls kind of killed the psychedelic, which, was good for me at the time because I was kind of tripping out. However, I would not recommend the 2-CB before MDMA combo in a social/indoor concert setting.<br />

				I think they&#039;re great in the mentioned setting.&nbsp; I just think you took too much and were a little overwhelmed. It&#039;s cool, it happens to everyone sometimes.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I like some xanax to have on hand with large doses.
