				Okay, normally I buy #4 heroin, and I have no trouble at all injecting it.&nbsp; However, occasionally I&#039;ll purchase tar (whether it&#039;s because the price to quality ratio was a great deal, there weren&#039;t any #4 options available for the right price or I didn&#039;t want to wait more than a day for delivery of #4, etc.).&nbsp; As far as prepping the BTH, that&#039;s easy.&nbsp; I use a shotglass, instead of a spoon (I have my reasons), use cold or room temp. water (I don&#039;t heat it or use a lighter--again, I have my reasons), and if it doesn&#039;t completely dissolve, I&#039;ll remove the plunger from the needle, and use it to stir the solution or mash the chunks along the bottom until it dissolves.&nbsp; Then I take a small piece of cotton as a filter and draw up the solution into the syringe.&nbsp; So far none of this is difficult.<br /><br />The problem I have now when dealing with BTH is when trying to make sure I&#039;m in the vein properly.&nbsp; With #4, the solution in the syringe is at least translucent or clear, so it&#039;s obvious you are in the vein when you register by pulling back on the plunger and seeing blood flow in.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not in the vein right, blood doesn&#039;t flow in, and you can adjust until you are.&nbsp; With BTH, the heroin solution in the needle is usually dark and opaque, so it&#039;s very tough to see blood flow in when registering.&nbsp; As a result, I sometimes miss the vein somewhat or completely, and the shot is partially wasted until I feel it going in wrong.<br /><br />So my question is if anyone has any techniques to insure you are in the vein completely when you can&#039;t visibly register the blood flowing in?&nbsp; Yeah, you can feel it hitting the vein sometimes.&nbsp; Also, you can try to judge how easily the plunger is pulled back when trying to register (if you are completely outside the vein, it&#039;s difficult to pull back on the plunger, or air flows in).&nbsp; Nonetheless, none of these quasi-techniques are nearly as effective as simply registering the blood flowing in when injecting #4.&nbsp; So does anyone have a method of registering when injecting tar that I haven&#039;t thought of?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure if my regular type was tar, I&#039;d have just developed an intangible feel for it--but I rarely do tar, so I need a more clear-cut method for making sure I&#039;m in the vein properly.&nbsp; I&#039;d be eternally grateful to anyone who can enlighten me to a way that will work every time I shoot tar.<br /><br />Thanks to anyone who has any suggestions.<br />KB47

				I have found that with dark tar, you have to filter it a few times with decent filters.&nbsp; All that black shit is non-active matter, and once removed (as best as one can) you will get a more tea colored solution, then you can get a visual register.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have a couple spots that I can hit real easy, and I usually don&#039;t have an issue injecting tar.&nbsp; I am also accustom to #4 powder, so when I first shot tar it was most definitely a change.

				Thanks for the quick reply, MC.<br /><br />That does seem like a solution that might work.&nbsp; My only concern with filtering it a few more times is if, in addition to removing the dark cut that&#039;s added to it, does it also remove some of the heroin and reduce its potency?&nbsp; Now I can give up a tiny bit of the active ingredient, but not too much, as money is tight.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping you&#039;ll tell me that it doesn&#039;t cut down on the potency that much at all, but I think I&#039;ll try your method anyway, regardless, just to see for myself and personally judge how it affects the potency.<br /><br />I too have a vein that I can hit much easier than the others (whether BTH or #4), but I don&#039;t like using it too much, or risk damaging it through overuse and lose it altogether (though right now that&#039;s a ways off, since I&#039;ve moderated its use).&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna go try your suggestion shortly, and see how well it works and judge how much (if any) it reduces the potency through multiple filtering attempts.<br /><br />Thanks again, MC.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to give someone a positive karma boost (new to posting), but if you tell me how, I&#039;ll give you one for being first to answer my question, and doing it so fast.&nbsp; I myself have just given up caring about my own karma stats but if you care about yours, I&#039;d be happy to boost yours.<br /><br />KB47
