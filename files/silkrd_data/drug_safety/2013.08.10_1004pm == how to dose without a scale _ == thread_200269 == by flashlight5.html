				lets say you get a gram of whatever substance. lets say you trust the vendor, that this is actually 1.0 or even 1.1.<br /><br />lets say you don&#039;t have a scale and don&#039;t want to get one.<br /><br />any1 experience with that &quot;cutting in half&quot; over and over again thing?<br /><br />thanks!

				I&#039;ve heard a lot of people use volumetric dosage when in such a situation.&nbsp; The idea is you dissolve a known amount of drug into a known volume of alcohol or other liquid.&nbsp; You then work out the amount of solution to take using some basic math.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much to measure 5ml than 1mg or w/e

Knowing how to dose your drug of choice well, brings lots of benefits. It reduces any harmful side effects, negative effects normally increase with dose. And it&#039;s cost effective, you get the most out of your stash using the amount that gets the most effects. <br /><br />You don&#039;t say which substance you want to take. But If you are mentioning a scale, my guess is that you already know that this substance needs to be measured correctly. Otherwise why ask? <br /><br />Volumetric, as fiveotwo, suggests is a good way of working out a dose without a scale. Still you have to know what solvent to use water etc. Still have to be careful, make sure your calculations are accurate. And better to be 1:1 with your ratio. Then any inaccuracies in the guess of the starting dose aren&#039;t magnified. <br /><br />Eyeballing can work, again depends on the drug. Splitting coke into equal lines isn&#039;t going cause many problems if lines are slightly unequal. With an RC or a 2C drug, 1mg can be the difference between great and not so great.<br /><br />What is it that you can&#039;t wait to take?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dude get a scale... dosing without a scale is so unsafe...<br /><br /><br />What if your vendor hooked it up with a gram extra?<br /><br />This is coming from someone who brought molly in half grams to a festival to sell for 35 to 40 dollars<br /><br />I told people to eat less than half the bag or to share it with 2 other friends <br /><br />A girl ended up in the hospital that night because she ate &quot;maybe a little more than half the bag&quot;<br /><br />.1&#039;s all day for easy dosing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />:)

				we talking 2cs and dmt.<br /><br />if 1mg is that important i will need a really good scale. and since i don&#039;t like to have stuff like that around, i will have to throw it away or bury it some place after using it once.<br /><br />putting all the 2cs in alc might be good. since i don&#039;t know what dose will be good for me ill start very small anyways. then i can judge the dose easily from the the first experience and take a number of drops needed. <br /><br />i just get a bottle with alc from the pharmacy and put the powder in there?<br /><br />since that won&#039;t work with dmt... i have not heard that overdosing by a bit is that much of a deal here. i mean, starting out slow of course.<br /><br />thanks guys

				right, 2c-x&#039;s can be eyeballed, but you need to be extremely careful. It helps to have a visual representation of what something close to 20mg looks like, and unfortunately, you really need a scale to get that.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be experimenting with these substances, you should really just hop on to Amazon and buy a cheap AWS mg scale. They&#039;re something like $25. Probably off by +/- 5mg, which sounds like a lot, but I&#039;ve used one for everything from heroin to 4-aco-dmt to diazepam to 2c-b and never unintentionally overdosed.
