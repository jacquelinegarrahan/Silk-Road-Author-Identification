				There has been alot of pills going round the UK lately containing PMA/PMMa, also there have been quite a few deaths recently linked with these pills..&nbsp; If anyone knows of any pills that contain PMA can you post a description of the pill colour/shape/logo here so we can all steer well clear.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start us off with green rolex pills, these have already killed over 10 youths in the UK already..<br /><br />Lets get this turned into a sticky also :)

				Recently consumed a pill in the Spain area and I&#039;m pretty sure it was orange with a nike tick on it.. can&#039;t quite remember though as my mate just handed it to me in a club after having just bought it, didn&#039;t really get a good look at it. <br />But I am pretty certain it was PMA as I&#039;ve had pipez, recreational RC&#039;s and all sorts of MDXX chems and this wasn&#039;t one of them.<br />Gave that feeling of being fucked up like MDMA but no euphoria, made me pretty lazy, extremely hot and massive body load combined with a massive headache which in turn caused me to spew my guts out. Very slight visuals on the comedown as well.<br />But yeah those in the southern Spain area - watch out for this one.

				God, who fucking does this? I feel too bad to even call 25i acid, or methylone molly...<br /><br />It&#039;s like these people don&#039;t realize you can make a fuck ton of money selling real drugs and actually running a legitimate business.
