				Hey !<br /><br />Some friends used to do a lot of mdma every week end... Hopefully they made a pause... <br /><br />Just wanted to know if they took a lot for a night ( from 11:00pm to 08:00am ) . <br /><br />They take like 1g by person ... making fat eyeballed 200mg caps for the first one then take 150mg caps every hour or sometimes less (45mins) ... <br /><br />So... Is that a lot ? I don&#039;t really like mdma because of the ultra depressing comedown... The max i took is 0.5g in one night. I think taking too much is ridiculous...<br /><br />It makes you do weird things like woken up dreams. My friends often used to do that, like for example closing their eyes and licking air saying &quot;Shit i can&#039;t lick the glue to close the envelopemhh ... uhhhh ... &quot; or thinking that stuff are falling on them like a books... <br /><br />

				Yes. lol. A good dosage is like 100-150mg, 200+ is strong dose. mind you most people don&#039;t even use it often only a 100-200mg dose once or twice a year even if that.

				Bit of a stoner myself but want to try out MDMA, from my research so far I&#039;ve heard re-dosing isn&#039;t really worth it or it&#039;s a bad idea (cant remember which lol), so the fact that they keep on taking 150mg caps every hour or 45 mins doesn&#039;t sound like a good idea...<br /><br />Hopefully someone with more experience/knowledge will chime in.

				Yes you are correct, re-dosing has no empathetic benefits, you won&#039;t roll harder.&nbsp; &nbsp; What do you guys think of MDMA losing it&#039;s magic,&nbsp; even if using twice a year?<br />

				I&#039;ve done prob. 500mg or so during my old 8up days.<br /><br />I used to believe you &#039;lose the magic&#039; but after coming to this website it was mostly due to terrible rolls in the USA.<br /><br />My friend has done well over 1000mg before ( bad idea ) and you pay for it - but you will be fine.&nbsp; Your body does a great job at recovering itself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve rolled easily around 100-200 times give or take.&nbsp; Wide range, I know lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />You guys are fine.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t be an idiot like me and do it 2x a week for 6 months.&nbsp; One of my worst stretches and had some great depression the days following my rolls.<br /><br />PRO-TIP : Don&#039;t use MDMA frequently to get rid of your problems.&nbsp; They will multiply your small problems by x10 and your big problems x10000.<br /><br />2x a month at most I would say.&nbsp; Better if you space it once every 3 months.&nbsp; You should be good for the rest of your life!!! :)

				2x a month is far too much. and even once every 3 is not needed..just my opinion I&#039;ve done well over 1000mg&#039;s too for about a year every day about .7 or so. It can lose it&#039;s magic. and shouldn&#039;t even need to be used that much it can help with alot of things if used wisely :)

				I tend to use the drug a couple times a month.<br />Serotonin takes longer to rebuild in your system than dopamine and usually once you get above 200mg you care only firing off dopamine and feeling its effects when redosing.<br /><br />Also I use mdma in lower dosages everyday life if i need a bit of a pick me up or to get me through a certain time period, when i feel i&#039;m lagging behind on something i have to get done.<br />It can be used as a weekly drug in low doses for slow days....it&#039;s not just for partying.<br /><br />Same goes with 2C-B i use it in a low dosage as an amphetamine type pick me up with maybe a little psychedelics.<br /><br />These drugs are useful for more than just getting high. They can improve your quality of life day to day.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

Hell it&#039;s currently being used in trials and used by the military to combat PTSD. So it can be a daily drug no argument in that. Ecstasy has just always been a party drug for me... Hell, I&#039;m young and fresh out of 6 years of college. What do you expect me to do? Go straight into the working world? No thank you, I&#039;ve done enough work in the past 24 years :P ANYWAY There have been MULTIPLE scientific movements on the removal of MDMA from schedule I into a lower schedule (preferably Schedule III) making it legal for medicinal uses.<br /><br />There&#039;s a negative connotation behind MDMA and it&#039;s party-goer&#039;s like myself fault. ::)

				One day I&#039;ll stop posting links on the effects of MDMA... not yet though.<br />http://dancesafe.org/drug-information/ecstasy-slideshow<br /><br />This is not psylocibin or LSD... LD50 of MDMA is not near as safe. Higher doses can cause significantly more harm. With MDMA, less is more.<br /><br />These empathogens and entheogens... with the right set and setting and proper intention have enormous therapeutic value. They are tools for the journey... they are Sacred Medicines.<br />http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/revision.html<br /><br />Of course they can be abused and used recreationally too. I spent many years blowing serotonin axon terminals among other things.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong... I still have a gram of mitanox&#039;s and some brown rolexes... plan to do some in February or March. My deal these days is integrating the journeys.

				Addictive in the classic sense. I like that statement. As I find that anything that makes you feel good is addictive. <br />I&#039;m new to MDMA, and am depressed reading the thread. It&#039;s the best I have ever felt, and wasn&#039;t depressed after coming down, but again, it was my 1st time, so I don&#039;t know. But I wish I could feel like that at least 4 hours a day,and H is too expensive, but if Molly&#039;s effects dwindle after time, then I guess H stays. <br />But I still think I am gonna get a 10g soon!!!<br />

				First off, are you sure your friends have real MDMA? I used to have friends who I&#039;d see at raves, and they&#039;d come up to me like, &quot;Ah shit dude I&#039;ve railed and eaten like a gram tonight and I feel great!&quot; Then I&#039;d look at their normal sized pupils and still legs. Normal jaws. A normal smile. Eventually tried their shit and it was like, cut-to-shit methylone. But they&#039;re dumbasses, lets assume your friends aren&#039;t.<br /><br />I used to roll every day, for about 2 weeks. Not hard, every day (100 mgish) but it hurt me and tapered off fast. I took a 4 month break and all was better--but the same? Probably not. Year before I binged on tabs for a week straight and couldn&#039;t read more than a few sentences in a book for a while, took months to regain my mental faculties fully. Not even sure I have today.<br /><br />I heard somewhere the effects plateau around 300 mg. May or may not be true. Seems like it to me. I&#039;d tell your friends to stick with that amount or less, anything more and its just dumb--the bad outweighs the good. Hell, the bad removes a lot of the good.<br /><br />Happy rolling.

I used to have friends who I&#039;d see at raves, and they&#039;d come up to me like, &quot;Ah shit dude I&#039;ve railed and eaten like a gram tonight and I feel great!&quot; Then I&#039;d look at their normal sized pupils and still legs. Normal jaws. A normal smile. Eventually tried their shit and it was like, cut-to-shit methylone. But they&#039;re dumbasses, lets assume your friends aren&#039;t.<br /><br />I used to roll every day, for about 2 weeks. Not hard, every day (100 mgish) but it hurt me and tapered off fast. I took a 4 month break and all was better--but the same? Probably not. Year before I binged on tabs for a week straight and couldn&#039;t read more than a few sentences in a book for a while, took months to regain my mental faculties fully. Not even sure I have today.<br /><br />I heard somewhere the effects plateau around 300 mg. May or may not be true. Seems like it to me. I&#039;d tell your friends to stick with that amount or less, anything more and its just dumb--the bad outweighs the good. Hell, the bad removes a lot of the good.<br /><br />Happy rolling.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah ! Of course they do ! I think we are quite experienced with mdma now... An where do we go (Free Party) people don&#039;t see RC&#039;s or things like that... <br /><br />(Besides they already did the 1gram thing with the good Koven&#039;s MDMA that i sold to them and every time revulsing eyeballs, jaw clenching, pissing every 30 minutes...) <br /><br />Over there you can get only true MDMA ( you can easily recognize it with that nice smell and awful taste) or fake shit that tastes less, doesn&#039;t smell, looks a little like MDMA in the form but is to weird to be some MDMA and has no psychoactive effect (sometime poisonous..). I don&#039;t know what that shit is and the people who sells that are called &quot;passeurs&quot; in french they come from midnight to 3am to sell their shit. You can recognize them because they dress up in dirty military-like clothes to look like the other ravers but wear brand new Nike TN shoes ... <br /><br />They usually come from ghettos... They make me laugh so much ! When i see them, even if i didn&#039;t buy something i go to them and say &quot;hey you sold me shit ! Give me my money back !&quot; Afterwards they say that I&#039;m making a mistake and tell me to find them some aluminum foil to burn it and prove it&#039;s mdma... So he goes to ask some of his disguised friends if they have some aluminum foil and they say no... Then he says come on help me find some! Then goes to a particular car with a guy waiting inside and asks. <br /><br />Asking for that is their code to say we are busted let&#039;s get the fuck out of here before the ravers bashes all of are bones and flips our car over !&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Then you usually go call the ravers to do that, and off you see the car going home ....&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s funny to see them asking you 100 times if you want any product. They say &quot;Bonsoir vous recherchez pas des produits?&quot; with their glass of whiskey-cola... But you can see all the ravers (teufeurs in french) with their 1.5L 60/40 mix of Pastis and water getting so fucking drunk ! <br /><br />Also an other thing... they come up to you and ask if you are looking for coke with a piece of plastic bag which contains the &quot;substance&quot;. You just need to ask them something else that looks like (powder form) the substance they claim to sell (let&#039;s say ketamine) and miraculously he opens the bag and says i have some ! look ! They have the power to change Coke in ketamine and ketamine in speed ... Funny magicians they are !<br /><br />Next time i see them i will surely be discreet and alert people of their presence so we can beat their asses up like they deserve...<br /><br />This often happens and it&#039;s good ! They deserve it ! It is dangerous because sometimes they sell crushed up Subutex tabs and sell it as ket... I saw someone who putted that shit up their nose and vomit all night... It&#039;s scary to see people have no soul and don&#039;t give a shit about others... <br /><br />Few examples : <br /><br />- http://www.modem76.com/article-ariege-des-dealers-chasses-par-des-teufeurs-de-teknival-50016941.html (pause the shitty radio on the right)<br /><br />- http://www.kewego.fr/video/iLyROoaftEM3.html<br /><br />- http://lelagdu.musicblog.fr/688243/Voila-ce-qui-arrive-aux-voitures-de-dealers-qui-viennent-pourrir-nos-fetes/<br /><br />- http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23c2e_teknival-toul-rosieres-2007-audi-s8_auto<br /><br />Solidarity still exists ! Nothing stops a dancing population ! <br /><br />That&#039;s why i like and will always go to free party&#039;s. Only there you can count on everybody else whatever problem you have (even if you are really hungry, not well and cold, people let you in their trucks to eat and sleep). Not like in nightclubs where you can see drunk people beating their selves up ...<br /><br />Please tell me what you think about all this. All opinions are welcome.<br />

				Wow, that was a great write-up jorg.&nbsp; Your english is pretty good as well haha.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I never have to buy anything in clubs.&nbsp; SR really helps eliminate some of the chance of buying bad/fake MDMA, or any substance for that matter.&nbsp; I too cringe when I see the younger guys at raves buying off some shady 30-something year old.&nbsp; Around my area the most common scam is to be sold piperazine still.&nbsp; That stuff has been circulating forever as MDMA.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, as for my dosage, I tend to reach my max at about 180mg.&nbsp; Anything higher than that is a waste for me, as 180 pretty much floors me if the molly is good quality.&nbsp; In most cases I say save your mgs!&nbsp; Having 2 nights with 150mg is much better than just 1 with 300mg.&nbsp; Leaving a month in-between rolls of course. <br /><br />
