				2011 was notable in being the year in which all my drug purchases were done online, and with a few exceptions where I bought MoneyPak with cash, all began via credit card transfer. I haven&#039;t actually kept track of it, and am planning to request this data tomorrow when the banks open. By my estimate it was definitely over $500, but probably under $1000. (edit: turns out it&#039;s actually about $1600)<br /><br />What about you?

				Gawwwd thinkin about this makes my legs wobble. Personally probably easily 4-5K. <br /><br />(Not an addict by the way, just go to a lot of raves lol....weekend = session time)<br /><br />If we are talking about work as well maybe Â£75-90K but that&#039;s a separate thing.

				Somewhere in the range of 2-3K I&#039;d have to say. I&#039;m a pretty mild opiate user, norco, oxy, etc so if I ever feel I am getting to close to the addiction point I&#039;ll just stop for several months at a time which curbs my spending quite a bit. Weed may add another 1K in or so.

				Not sure I want to do the calculations to be honest.&nbsp; Probably could have bought a nice car. ha.&nbsp; Well.... let&#039;s see, probably around $300 a week so last year was around $15,000.&nbsp; Oh wow, now I&#039;m depressed.

				Well since I usually order extra and share with friends for a little profit.. I think I&#039;ve actually made money off drugs since using SR, despite not even being close to a &quot;dealer&quot; IRL.

				~2000 on heroin and percs<br />~1000 on ecstasy (gave a lot to friends for house parties)<br />~500 on weed<br />~500 on everything else (RC&#039;s, shrooms, etc.)<br /><br />4000 looks about right.

				A little bit over $3000 have been spent here on SR, and that&#039;s not including the probably $2500 I&#039;ve spent on collecting as many RCs as possible. The RCs have been collected for some years, but I&#039;ve only been buying on SR for about 3 months. &gt;.&lt;
