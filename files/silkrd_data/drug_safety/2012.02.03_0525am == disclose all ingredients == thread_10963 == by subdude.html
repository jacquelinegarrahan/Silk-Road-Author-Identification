				there are people here who like to mix what they think is the perfect high chemical wise. or theyre out of what you ask for ,they do not however reveal every ingredient so a persrr8on can make an informed decision. i was sold methylone/ and something mix called methylone. im the 1 in 100 or 1000 who react badly to certain things.

				Yes, I totally agree! I just think it&#039;s downright immoral to sell a product without listing its actual ingredients! I know a ton of the E sold on the streets these days is mostly just unscheduled analogs. Cheap (compared to MDMA) and still quasy-legal until sold as E. It&#039;s a fundamental right for someone to know what their ingesting.

When the reagent tests or lab tests don&#039;t match up, confront the vendor about it. Depending on their reaction, you&#039;ll either get better stuff or stop buying from them in the future. We have to keep them accountable, though.

				Yes vendors realize you might actually kill some ppl when you cut your powders with some substances.<br />First of all you shouldnt be cutting drugs in the first place.<br />2. People have allergic reactions to some chemicals and it is very much real life threatening.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				&nbsp; The vendors here seem to be dealing in quite small amounts and there is probably 4 or 5 levels of distributors&nbsp; above them that may be cutting.&nbsp; I have asked two vendors what the product was cut with when the picture/description looked a bit funny and they both told me it was cut, one told what it was, and the other one just said some weird European shit, naturally I didn&#039;t buy.&nbsp; So I think reputable vendors are honest but sometimes they just dont know, but most seem to describe products honestly.&nbsp; This is not a site for rules, although if we need someone to sample each drug, I would volunteer.&nbsp; It is buyer beware.<br /><br />We are the ones using the product and we need to take precautions and seek help asap if we start getting bad effects, we should make sure we are not alone, I either get a friend to come over, or go out in public no matter what my state (a couple of times not pretty - vommited the length of the main street once).&nbsp; If we think it is really bad don&#039;t hesitate to go to a hospital.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doctors will not call the police, unless you are violent.&nbsp; The worst the doctors will do is make you have a choice go to a consellor or the police (this happened to a friend).

				I&#039;m terrified of being sold what I think is LSD that is actually an RC that could cause serious unwanted effects/duration, or even death at high doses. Not cool. :(
