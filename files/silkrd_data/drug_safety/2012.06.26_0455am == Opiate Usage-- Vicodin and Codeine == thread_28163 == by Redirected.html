				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Just joined SR a few weeks ago, and my friend and I just got our first package--10 5mg vicodin pills. Now, I&#039;ve already gone through them unfortunately because they didn&#039;t seem to affect me much. Friday night I took one just to see if it would affect me at all, and after one hour nothing really happened and so I figured that I&#039;d just go to sleep, but it didn&#039;t even help me with that. Then, I decided on saturday that I would up the dosage. Tried 2 for a total of 10mg, but even that didn&#039;t do anything after an hour, so I took another one. Again, an hour later I hardly felt anything, so I took one more to bring me up to the oft recommended dose of 20mg. An hour or two after that I began to feel itchy--as expected--then kind of nauseous. I began to half fall asleep and could hardly stay focused on netflix, but I didn&#039;t really get much pain relief which was weird because I&#039;ve never really done ANYTHING except alcohol, so I figured I&#039;d have a low tolerance. Part of the being tired might have been from the lack of sleep the night before.<br /><br />Today, I decided I&#039;d try the rest of my pills after work. So after dinner I took 3 and half for a totaly of 17.5 mg, and then after feeling literally nothing an hour later, I took the pill and a half I had left, bringing me up to 25mg. I should add that I chew the pills and swallow them as my friend told me that that is what I&#039;m supposed to do (By all means correct me if we are wrong.) So an hour later, I&#039;m still feeling almost nothing and its been about 2 and a half hours since I took my first 3 and a half. I have to go drive somewhere for ten minutes, lift a heavy object up some stairs, and drive back. Still, nothing. Didn&#039;t even feel any more tired than usual. But today I didn&#039;t even feel nauseous. Slightly itchy, but that&#039;s it? What&#039;s wrong with me? Am I doing something wrong? I thought 10-20 would be enough to enjoy myself and feel relaxed, but even 25mg did nothing.&nbsp; We have some codeine coming in soon, so I hope that works better. Any advice? I&#039;m really confused about why I feel nothing from these pills.<br /><br />Thanks for any help you guys can give me!<br /><br />Cheers

				Opiates are very hard to start off with, because unless you&#039;re doing extremely hard ones, they are almost unnoticeable unless you know what you&#039;re looking for. You won&#039;t get fucked up. That said, there are some good things to keep in mind.<br /><br />Potentiate. Pure grapefruit juice is traditional. Read this guide: http://taimapedia.org/index.php?title=Opiate_Potentiation<br />DO NOT DO THIS WITH CODEINE OR IT WILL NOT WORK AT ALL.<br /><br />Have an empty stomach when you take them.<br /><br />Dissolve your tablets in water and drink them. This will decrease onset time.<br /><br />You felt itchy. That means it did work. Take them and lie down in bed and try to meditate. Pay attention to how your limbs feel.<br /><br />Hydrocodone and codeine, despite being my most used opiates, are rather weak, so don&#039;t expect rolling orgasmic pleasure.

				Unfortunately, the only thing I&#039;m going to have will be codeine, so I&#039;ll have to work with that. What is the recommended dosage for vicdoin and codeine?<br /><br />I understand that being itchy means they are &#039;working&#039;, but I really felt absolutely nothing else besides being itchy for a little while. It didn&#039;t relieve any pain and it didn&#039;t really have another effects. Is it possible that opiates don&#039;t affect me that much? The only ones I had before this weekend were percs when I got my wisdom teeth out, and they hardly helped either. That just ended with my throwing up. <br /><br />Thanks for you help.

				Any other advice guys ? The codeine should be coming in sometime this week, and I don&#039;t want to waste it all lke I did the vicodin. I don&#039;t wanna necessarily get &#039;rolling orgasmic pleasure,&quot; but it would be nice to finally feel something nice for all the money I&#039;ve spent.&nbsp; I heard 150-180mg is good for a first time codeine user, is that correct?

Good luck to yuh hope you get what your looking for.

				tbh it used to take me about 8*12.5 mg codeine nurofen plus to even feel a thing. after a short while that didnt do much either.<br /><br />if you can get hold of oxycodone on here then 2-5mg will be an easy start and you&#039;ll definitely notice it. zoning the fuck out in front of the computer is the usual indication apart from just full body warmth!<br /><br />otherwise dihydrocodeine will work too if you can get it. half of a 120mg dihydrocodeine would be a good start. make sure you double and triple check with one of the online opiate converters just so you dont make yourself sick, especially if you start fucking around with the harder stuff.

One pharmacist actually told me that Ibuprofen+Codeine (i.e: NeurofenPlus or PanafenPlus) was their most sold item in the whole store, which should tell you something about ho many people abuse it :P<br /><br />NB: If you do have a lot of Ibuprofen+Codeine or any other combination that isn&#039;t straight opiates, MAKE SURE YOU DO A COLD WATER EXTRATION. Look it up, memorize how to do it, but for the love of god do not put that much strain on your liver and kidneys by having raw tablets.

				I can get codeine as a few workmates bring in any spare meds which saves me having to pay.<br /><br />I got a prescription but keep that for emergencies. In the UK you can get codeine and dihydro-codeine prescribed. You can get codeine OTC in the form of 8 - 12.5 mg of dihydro or codeine. We used to filter by cold water and lab filters to get the codeine out from the paracetamol. <br /><br />As for doses, be careful, newbies can feel doses as low as 30mg.<br /><br />Usually any person who uses heroin will turn down codeine as the tolerance is way up and codeine levels out leaving yo uuable toget higher on increasingly higher doses. People have gone to a 3 gram a day habit but that would possibly kill you or I. <br /><br />Oxycodone I was surprised how pricey it was and how weak 10mg is. Equal to maybe 30 - 60mg of codeine IMO.<br /><br />Vicodin, I thought hat was super strong, but maybe you need a decent dose and maybe the price of that decent dose is more expensive than heroin!<br /><br />Anyhow - you can use codeine on a full stomach but it takes longer to hit and the high is not as fast hitting for some.<br /><br />Hangover cure par excellence.<br /><br />I&#039;d advise for 30mg at first, then maybe 45, 60, 75, 90 and at around 240mg that is time to take a rest as codeine tolerance will lower even after a days break.<br /><br />Benign drug if you get the pure.<br /><br />The slow release dihydro-codeine can be crushed and effectis the same as instant.<br /><br />These come in 30mg, 60mg, 90mg and 120mg.<br /><br />I get the tiny 30mg codeine. Bitter as hell to taste. No need to crush these as they are instant. Can hit in a few minutes on an empty stomach.<br /><br />This is as near as I will get to heroin!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />

				Okay, so I took 5 30mg codeine along with two 25mg benedryl. An hour later, I kind of felt a little something in my head but not that much. Between hours 1.5 and 3 i had some stomach pain off and on, but no real good feeling. Nor was I tired. Also, when my stomach was hurting, my aches and pains actually got a lot worse. My back, shoulders, and elbow really started to flare up worse than it was when I took them. This feels like the opposite of what sould be happening... should I take less? Or more? Why the hell is nothing hitting me when other people feel it on half as much? <br /><br />I&#039;d love for this to work, and I had already planned to get more BTC, but after this idk.

				I agree that opiates take a while to get used to, unless of course you&#039;re in pain. Then you notice the effects right away :)<br /><br />For the hydrocodone (vikes) and oxycodone (percs), I recommend the following potentiation method:<br /><br />Source: http://humanasemeritus.com/dose-zine/issue-one/<br /><br />* T-60) 600mg Taga­met HB(Cimetidine HCl), 1000mg DLPA OR 500mg N-Acetyl-Tyrosine and a large glass of (white) Grape­fruit juice, prefer­ably from con­cen­trate. Add in an extra strength tums or 1.5tbsp. of bak­ing soda if you are going to be eat­ing your opi­ates.<br />* T-45) 30mg DXM HBr, 90mg phenyl­to­lax­am­ine cit­rate, 600mg Mag­ne­sium citrate\taurate\glycinate\chelate<br />* T-20 A bot­tle of tonic water (qui­nine), 880mg Naproxen Sodium. A cup of cof­fee, or a strong black tea. Take another tums now if you’re eat­ing your opi­ate to coun­ter­act the tonic water<br />* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opi­ate<br />* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more, you don’t want to over power it.<br /><br />DO NOT USE WITH CODEINE!!!!<br /><br />I personally leave off the tagament, amino acids, caffeine, magnesium and lower the amounts of tonic water and Naproxen. IMO, you don&#039;t really need all that. My advice would be to try the following:<br /><br />* T-60) A large glass of white Grape­fruit juice, prefer­ably from con­cen­trate. Add in an extra strength tums or 1.5tbsp. of bak­ing soda if you are going to be eat­ing your opi­ates.<br />* T-45) 30mg DXM HBr, 25mg diphenhydramine (benadryl) or the recommended (on the label) dose of phenyl­to­lax­am­ine cit­rate or CPM (if you can find those instead of benadryl)<br />* T-20 A large glass of tonic water, 240mg Naproxen Sodium (two pills). Take another tums now if you’re eat­ing your opi­ate to coun­ter­act the tonic water<br />* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opi­ate<br />* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two.<br /><br />This will turn 5mg of oxycodone into what feels like 10mg, and will make it last for 6-8 hours. I&#039;m a pretty big guy and 5mg works every time with this formula. It&#039;s not enough to feel like pure ecstasy, but it works for pain and I feel damn good while I&#039;m on it.

				Different kind of fucked up meaning it&#039;s mostly a body thing and your vision isn&#039;t really gonna be as impaired as much as say drinking alcohol and such ..This is from personal experience anyway but I suppose it could be different for others. Yes I think you should maybe shoot for 210mg but since 150mg made you sick codeine could just not be your thing because I know it does tend to be an opiate that makes people sick.

				Alright, that&#039;s probably preferable actually. Would it help my stomach if I don&#039;t take them all at once and sort of space them out, or no? I was thinking of trying a few without benedryl since I read you arent really supposed to do that potentiating stuff with them. Might that work? <br /><br />I will add that although my stomach hurt with the codeine, it was no where near as bad as the vicodin pain which made me hardly want to talk and just go to bed.&nbsp;
