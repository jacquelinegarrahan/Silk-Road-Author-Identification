				Well long story short I ran into a little issue recently where the police took a good amount of different drugs out of my house. The thing is I had like 100 sheets of 25i-nbome. Which they took and of coarse said it is 100% illegal because it is from the 2c family.<br />Well I&#039;m waiting for a court date and hate being drug free. Basically is it possible for them to test me for 25i-nbome? If not i am gonna buy 100 tabs off tyl3r and trip every day until my court date.<br />Also as a side note, what drugs or chemicals can I do assuming they will most likely do an extended test for all the RC&#039;s they took.<br />I&#039;m sending good karma to anyone who can help me out. <br />DADDY NEEDS HIS FIX!!!!!

Which is what... 90,000 tabs?<br />And in another thread you are apparently importing 40kg cocaine from South America.<br /><br />So let me get this straight... Police confiscated thousands of doses of NBOMe from your house, you have a court date for that and now you are importing 40kg cocaine from South America, despite having pending drug charges? And you can&#039;t stay sober for a little while?<br /><br />You&#039;re either full of shit or a complete retard.<br />Which is it? or is it both?

				Sorry to burst your bubble, but due to tolerance, you couldn&#039;t trip every day.<br />The 25x chems have even longer cycles of tolerance than LSD, and are cross-tolerant with other psychedelics.<br />If you want to trip several days in a row, mescaline is pretty forgiving, if difficult and expensive to get.<br />To get fucked up for awhile, you have to plan it out to avoid cross tolerance and maximize your enjoyment of each substance.<br /><br />I do think you should think about what you&#039;re doing though.&nbsp; Balls or not, the cops are on to you, and while the RC&#039;s might get you a slap on the wrist, 40kg will sink you fast.&nbsp; I hope you&#039;ve got some customs agents on your side.<br /><br />As for testing, I don&#039;t know anything about it.&nbsp; I do know they are unlikely to test, as why would the court care if you&#039;ve ingested the substance or not, they only care that you intended to distribute. Unless you are already on probation for something else...

				There isn&#039;t much info on testing for RC&#039;s out there because usually people get busted for drugs. Not these chems. I haven&#039;t seen any reports of nbome labs getting broken up or anything.<br />I guess I&#039;m good to use it. <br />So other then 25i what substances can I fuck with assuming I will be handed an extended drug test.

				triptamines(Mipt,Dipt,Dmt etc) , 2c chemicals, some stimulants like mdpv, modafinil etc most of the non&nbsp; common drugs. <br /><br />you should avoid: cannabis, PCP, amphetamines(meth,mdma, dextro) , coke, opiates.<br /><br /><br />

For lsd it&#039;s a case by case scenario. It&#039;s extremely uncommon and costs 8000$ to do, but if they think you were selling lsd than they wouldn&#039;t bat an eyelash. <br />And cops are stupid enough to just say the 25i on Hoffman tabs was similiar enough to lsd that they need to test for it.

				So.. The OP gets on SR forums and says he was busted with 100 sheets. He also mentioned that he would buy X amount from tyler, which in turn suggest anything he is getting is from SR (more negative attention). IF he is still trying to get weight to him and continue to deal, then yes he is putting the road at risk. More intel on the drugs (fingerprints, careless data storage) and for all we or the OP knows, a door could be kicked in during packaging and there is at least 1 person popped due to being careless. I am not saying this is how you (OP) runs things, but I am saying these are things that pop in my head.<br /><br />I had a friend that was in trouble for distribution at one time. He was strung out and didn&#039;t give a shit. He went to prison.
