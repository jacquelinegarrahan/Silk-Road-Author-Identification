				I read recently that Hash does not store well because it breaks down or dries out quickly to where the THC levels diminish. Is this true? If so, does anyone have a best way to store hash? Thanks.

				Since I&#039;m not a chemist I can&#039;t say for sure but I have frozen it before and it seemed to retain it&#039;s potency. I just sealed it up real good to keep it from getting freezer burn and stored some for about a year.

				Seal it in plastic, keep it in a jar, freeze it, or better yet do all three. ;)

				Heat, light and air exposure will affect potency to some degree.&nbsp; Moisture is bad too, but more for mold reasons.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say hash doesn&#039;t store well, but the above factors are the main things that will oxidize thc into cbn.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well pressed hash will store much better than fragile crumbly hash, due to the fact that the outer shell will protect the majority of the material inside from oxidization.

				Put it in a few ziploc bags and put the bags in a mason jar and keep the jar in a cool dry place. If you do it right you should maintain potency for years. Also, always keep your weed stash separate from any other stash just in case you get raided.

				Lolz, definitely thought the thread was titled &quot;snorting hash&quot;. I&#039;m a little disappointed now that I see what it actually is. <br /><br />On topic: I second all the motions to keep it in a mason jar somewhere cold, always worked for me!

				Thanks for the 411. I have come across some that is crumbly, but good. I only got a couple grams, so I do not plan to store it. I wouldn&#039;t mind having a boatload to store though. Can&#039;t wait to try bubble.

				hash stores the best in a very dry container in the refrigerator. one time i got put in treatment and got tested every week so i couldn&#039;t smoke for a year. i kept a 10g little brick of hash in a Tupperware container in the fridge and it was still great stuff after a year.
