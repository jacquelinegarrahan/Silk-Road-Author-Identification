				In the short run a few k-holes or mild doses throughout the day may seem like they are helping you but it is doubtful. As soon as you start feeling depressed again or anything negative comes up in your life, I can almost guarantee you will be reaching for the K. That is from personal experience too. Not to mention that prolonged ketamine use can cause some internal damage that I really don&#039;t want to get into, so do some research on the clearnet. From what I have read, anesthetic IV doses seemed to have the most success in depressed patients and they seemed to never have any major issues from then on, but I wouldn&#039;t get close to that amount of K on your own. You would be playing with fire. On the bright side, there is a good chance a couple of K holes might get you thinking straight and you may let go of the major issues at hand that are most likely causing major depression. There is definitely some medical potential there especially since ketamine has a proven ability to promote synapse growth. Good luck to you on which ever route you seek.

				I recently tried some ketamine to test this out.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t k-hole (don&#039;t think I even came close really; I&#039;ve had stronger disassociative experiences from the herbal incense shit you can buy at the local head shop) and I did not notice any anti-depressive effects.<br /><br />Maybe if I had done some stronger doses...but who knows...

				I&#039;m not going to recommend it because of the undoubted risks involved. Ketamine can cause psychosis, bladder damage, and possibly even brain damage. So be careful. But I have tried ketamine twice, and in both instances my depressive symptoms were considerably relieved. I am going to continue experimenting with this drug, and I will report back later.

				There is a lot of great research supporting this. My wife and I did this for 9 sessions. Every 3 weeks we injected .6ml/kg. A drug can&#039;t magically cure depression but it helps buffer against the chemical hold depression has so it becomes easier to deal with it focusing on the psychological approaches.

				Your outlook on drugs isn&#039;t accurate. Just because something is a classic as opposed not well understood&nbsp; RC&#039;s because they are new does not make them better. RC&#039;s just lack understanding and research, does not mean they are recreation only. All those &quot;Classics&quot; were RC&#039;s for quite some time&nbsp; ;)

				Some of you are very misinformed on the medicinal uses of K. There is a lot of great research showing that K has many properties of SSRI&#039;s and unlike the standard medicaiton K works within minutes instead of weeks. It has been shown to increase BDNF expression, which encourages neurogenesis in the hippocampus (this is known to be decreased due to excessive stress in depression). Ket will also act as an SSRI and a potent one at that.<br /><br />*****BUT******<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t mean &quot;K-hole and you&#039;ll be out of your depression&quot; far from it. All of the research into medicinal values of K are on LOW DOSES. The higher the dose =/= the better it will work. Also Ketamine is a very long lasting antidepressant, meaning it will linger around for up to 10 days. If you plan on using this drug as an antidepressant DO NOT take it everyday, you will become tolerant and even dependent if you are convinced its working.<br /><br />My advice is to take 10-15 mg of K nasally in the morning every 5-7 days and while you are on this drug keep a journal of your experiences. Do you feel that you handle the same situations better or worse after you started this routine, and if so why? Introspection here can be tricky but you need to change the behavior in order to change the attitude in a disorder such as depression. You don&#039;t want to be on K for the rest of you life but it can be a powerful catalyst to end depression if used correctly.
