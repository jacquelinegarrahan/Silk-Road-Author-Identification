				I read an excellent text file a few years back that had very good info on beating a drug test. It wasn&#039;t any gimicky ad for a diuretic or anything like that but it was full of really good info. I was wondering if anyone else was familiar with this text file and could remind me of where to find it as i&#039;ve been searching all day and can&#039;t seem to pin it down/if you have any other good recommendations in general. My sig other has a test in 6 days so were are trying to find good, reliable info as quickly as possible.

				Well I&#039;m assuming your significant other must use marijuana or benzos because most other drugs would be out of his/her system within that 6 day time period. If they are taking a urine screen and don&#039;t have to be watched I would recommend fake urine. I have passed a urine test twice with a product called UrineLuck. Just make sure to get the most current version of UrineLuck if you decide to go this route.If they have to be watched and your significant other is a guy there is always the option of a fake penis with a urine delivery system. I suppose the only other way without a diuretic would be just to drink a shitload of water and take a multivitamin a couple hours before the test to keep the specific gravity of your urine up. If your specific gravity is too low they usually consider that a fail. Hope this helps :)

				SNARP thank you SO MUCH, i found the one i was looking for!! would not have been able to find it without your help!<br /><br />Re: losthighway, yes he use(d) marijuana (in addition to a shitload of other things that he has prescriptions for) by the time of his upcoming drug test which is this tuesday, it will have been about 2.5 weeks since he last smoked. He smoked regularly about every other day before then. Would you tell me how you think he will fair? <br /><br />Here is some more background on our ridiculous situation....&nbsp; one promising evening after work we decide we should go out for dinner and drinks. I decide that this would also be an optimum time to get fucked up out of my fucking mind. On the way to the restaurant/bar i pop two or three ambiens (the devil&#039;s drug!!) i know that sounds like a lot, but i had a bit of a tolerance built up to it by that point in time. After we eat he decides he wants to take one too, provided we don&#039;t have to drive anywhere for several more hours. By this point i&#039;m drinking like a sailor on top of my ambi&#039;s, but he was being responsible and only had a few drinks. We stay out for several more hours and decided that he was up to driving home by then. We begin our trek without incident and about 30 minutes into the trip i&#039;m feeling a little frisky and decide to initiate some sexual conduct on the road. But before anything can come to fruition I start feeling extremely sick and woozy. Before I know it, i&#039;m puking all down my bf&#039;s pants and onto his sauseege. Would you believe that my bf started to swerve all over the road? And it&#039;s exactly at this point that we see blue lights behind us, with a cop screaming at my bf that he &quot;swerving all over the road&quot;. Um, yeah, wouldn&#039;t you be too? My bf tries to explain the situation to him without throwing me under the bus but the cop is just not hearing it. He pulls him out of the car and breathalizes him. .03. But this cop is on a mission. He says my bf must be on something else and hauls him down to the station to take blood and charge him with a DWI. The bf gave them the long list of medications he is on: alprazolam, xanax, ambien, celexa. He neglected to mention the weed, for obvious reasons. So they take his blood and we still have no idea what they found because apparently we don&#039;t get to find out until his trial date in this county. When they drew his blood he hadn&#039;t smoked herb for approx. one day. So we are not sure if they will find it, or if they will even test for it since it hadn&#039;t come up in his convos with him at all.<br /><br />Anyway, moving along with this jolly story, word of what happened gets to his work and they&#039;re making him take a pee test next tuesday. We have been running twice a day since he found out and only eating vegetables, and then two days before the test i plan on fattening him up with some good clean fat and drown him in tons of water. I have heard that if the pee is too translucent or if it doesn&#039;t have the right amt of certain pee-related substances that the testers can be tipped off that you&#039;re trying to dilute. I&#039;m not sure what specific gravity is or how to keep it up so if losthighway or anyone else could enlighten me would be MUCH appreciated. thanks again for all the help so far.

				&nbsp; Sounds like a crazy night. If your boyfriend has a low amount of body fat I would say if he was smoking every other day that 2.5 weeks would be long enough for the marijuana to be out of his system. The main thing they look at when first giving a urine sample is color, temperature, specific gravity,ph, and creatinine levels. If he is going to dilute his urine with water the three things that would give that away is the color, specific gravity, and creatinine levels. Specific gravity is more or less the amount of dissolved solids in your urine. If your pissing out basically water the specific gravity is going to be low. By taking a multivitamin or more specifically a b-complex multivitamin 2 to 3 hours before the test the urine would be colored yellow intead of clear and the specific gravity would be higher. Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism and gives indication of kidney function. If the creatinine level is too low that will be an indication that the urine has been diluted. You can bye creatine which is what creatinine is derivative of at GNC and start taking it a few days before the test to keep his creatinine levels up. Red meat can also help keep creatinine levels up so that&#039;s a second option.<br />&nbsp; I understand your concern and that sounds like a pretty shitty situation. Keep working out and eating right which will help speed up his metabolism. I still think 2.5 weeks sounds like a solid time for him to be clean. Hopefully my advice will help you out and don&#039;t let him stress too much.

				I know this is an old thread but I didn&#039;t want to make a whole new one, but I&#039;m wondering if UrineLuck really works or if anyone has tried it?<br />I don&#039;t want the additive crap though, I&#039;m looking for synthetic and I found this Quick Fix stuff by Spectrum Labs:<br />http://www.urineluck.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=10<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it matters, but this is the kind of cup they use for the drug test I need to take:<br />http://www.ezkeycup.com/E_Z_Key_Cup_12_p/doa-1127-041.htm<br /><br />Advice is appreciated.
