				My dear friends and DMT users.<br /><br />The last 2 months I have been experimenting with the substance called dmt. Since money is not my favorite friend I can&#039;t afford to invest in a Glass Vapor Genie and therefore I am using the Machine method.<br /><br />I have built quite a few machines 250ml, 100ml, 65ml and my last is 45ml. I use the 2 small ones now.<br />Lately the vapor I am getting is harsher and I believe that it is because my DMT is melted on top of the brillo. The way I load my machine is that I first put the brillo inside the bottle and then load and melt my DMT. Is there any better way to load my machine?<br /><br />Secondly, I am really thinking to invest, when I have the chance, some money on the GVG and I want to ask you how much better is the GVG from the Machine? <br /><br />If for example you could compare those 2 with scale 1-100, how much &quot;points&quot; does the GVG get and how much does the Machine get?<br />I have taken almost 1-1,5 grams of dmt and still find it hard to vaporize it perfectly and I haven&#039;t experienced any break through or out of body experiences. Your thoughts will be more than appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks in advance and all the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				I cannot compare the GVG Sherlock to &quot;The Machine&quot; because i have never used the latter but i can tell you that investing in a GVG is a very good idea. I use a few screens and a volcano liquid pad cut down to size and sit the DMT (50mg) on top. It may take a few goes to get the technique right but when you do you can easily vaporize all the DMT in one hit. I&#039;ve blasted off roughly 30 times using the GVG and had some crazy crazy OBE&#039;s.<br />Hope this helps a a little.

				Well, it didn&#039;t answer my question totally, but I am sure that using a GVG is much more efficient than the machine. I just wondered how big different they are. Thanks for your answer by anyway. I am gathering money to slowly slowly buy it.<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Adamiz
