Personally, I like to crush up a bag of crystals into a nice find powder, and take a small pinky dip from the bag every 45-60min throughout the night if I want a booster.&nbsp; I&#039;m also partial to snorting small booster doses, usually 30-40mg up the nose at a time. Usually don&#039;t exceed 300mg per night.&nbsp;

You won&#039;t get a 6 hour peak.. if you re-dose a third time it&#039;s just dopamine (the speedy effect) and not serotonin (the love/happy effect).<br /><br />1. 125-150mg<br />2. About 1.5 hours after that drop ~75mg<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably reach 3.5-4 hours of &#039;trip&#039; but after that it starts to come down.. that&#039;s just the way it is.

				Wait, I have always wondered something. Is snorting seriously that big of a waste oif it&#039;s crushed up enough? Also, will an alkaline GI tract help in the same way that it helps amphetamines?

				best dose has and redosing technique has been adequately described. Next decision is how/where you want to trip. There are two main options:<br /><br />1: Take about 120-140 mg with group of friends or with significant other. Go out to club/dance bar, have&nbsp; afew drinks, re dose another 40 mg after a couple hours of fun. Keep dancing and enjoying the energy and community.<br /><br />2: Take 120-140 mg solely with a significant other. Rent a hotel room by the beach or a cabin by a national park. Hike through the beauty of nature and redose 40mg after a few hours while watching the majesty of the ocean or the woods. Draw on the stimulation of the environment and bond in a loving and trusting way with your partner. Then bang all night till the sun comes up.

				With Pfandheiler&#039;s MDMA, wich is a nice one, i take 200mg bombs, i fill in empty capsules that look like pills.<br /><br />The kick is awsome, very strong, will take you rolling for about 5 hours, it&#039;s an intense experience. I do this only in places i know i can.<br />For more discreet places, take lower doses, make 2 pills of 120mg, will rolle less intensely but for longer.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like the usual pills you take. Actually, if you want some serious pills, but the 200mg triforce. This is some strong shit too. But i prefer to buy crystals and make my own ;)<br /><br />By preference:<br /><br />*Bombs, for nice full impact of MDMA;<br /><br />*Taken mixed with beer, it&#039;s nice to get me rollin with less intensity, it gives you a little more the sensation of love, than euphoria.<br />&nbsp;<br />*snorting it , it&#039;s painful, the taste will drop for a long time in your throat and the effects are quick to start, but will end sooner too. I don&#039;t recommend this...<br /><br />And don&#039;t forget to drink lots of water :)<br />

				Avoid the MDMA in your mouth, it&#039;s hazardous for your teeth..<br /><br />For the real good feeling you should go for 150mg and take another bomb of 80mg if you want to roll a bit more.<br /><br />Buy some stomach pills that come in the form of capsules, open them and throw the content away, fill them with MDMA, voilá, you have some home made pills

				I like to put 120mg up my butt, and while I&#039;m waiting for that to kick in, take a 50mg IV shot. Bam! Instant euphoria, but the IV doesn&#039;t last long, so just as that&#039;s wearing off, the rectal dose kicks in for a second, more gentle peak that lasts a long time.

				If you are not a fan of snorting (which really is a waste of good molly, AND, MDMA is a rather harsh burn on the nose) and you want it to hit you fast and hard. i have found that the best method is to dissolve the dose in a shot glass of warm water and down it. followed by some OJ to mask the taste. (its bitter as hell, and it will make you cringe like the first time you take a shot of cheap tequila. but you will be peaking hard in 30 minutes or so)<br /><br />If you are a first timer than you should start with around 100mg and take a 50mg booster a few hours later if needed.<br />But if the OP really wants to roll hard than they should start out with 150mg or so with a 50-100mg booster 2-3 hours later

				ha, yeah, i.e. we even have in my language ;) ... another question (I got a lot, I know...) is there a difference between dissolving it in water (or juice) and taking a bomb? because both get just directly in your stomach...

				The main difference is absorption rates.<br />When a drug is dissolved in a liquid it will be absorbed by your body in a quicker and more efficient manner.<br /><br />Because the liquid will pass more quickly though your intestines and allow the drug to make more surface contact with the membranes that it must be absorbed by. <br />when you take a pill or some other solid, it must first be dissolved and than absorbed in your stomach.<br /><br />Hence a liquid will hit you harder and quicker than a solid of the same dose.

				so does it need to dissolve totally before I drink it?&nbsp; I mean, does it take some time to dissolve, like salt for instance...?<br />I think I asked that already, but whatever.... when I take another dose at the peak...I&#039;m probably &#039;on the road&#039;, dancing, whatever...and I might not be able to dissolve it somewhere, is the dipping then a good alternative..?&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering how to guess how much would be for example 50mg(like the half of the first dose)

				It will take a minute or two to dissolve which Is why i mentioned using warm water (and a little stirring will help)<br /><br />And taking a dip is fine for the booster. the whole point of the liquid is to make it hit stronger and the point of the booster is to make it last longer. <br />Since you are already rolling when you take the booster, the liquid is not as important.<br /><br />And yes. most people find that a good booster dose is half the size of the initial dose

				Really Urbana, the only way to take it is to dissolve it in water, and stick it up your bum. <br /><br />Aside from the onset of action (how fast it takes effect) you&#039;ll notice little to no difference from different means of oral ingestion. If you want to find out about all kinds of different ways people take it, and how it effects them, check out the experience vaults on Erowid. You can even find a report or two of women sticking MDMA up their vaginas. Really, if someone&#039;s thought of it, they&#039;ve written about it on Erowid.

				hey there,..<br />just tested it last friday.... and would be very happy about some judgement of yours... we took the mdma at home, it was very difficult to estimate the amount, because the scales didn&#039;t really work. so I took (I guess) about 100mg the others around 80mg (all girls, some very skinny). so we dissolved it in some warm water. but the effects weren&#039;t as euphoric and positive as we all expected... lots of physical effects. waves of sweating and being hot, then problems with the curcuit, one felt sick again and again, couldm&#039;t stand up (so we stayed home the whole time - until 7 in the morn), another friend couldn&#039;t really move, had to refocuse her eyes all the time. I especially had problems with the circuit, was dizzy but also felt well again then. like always wanted to sit down again, but then again had to move. but nobody was really feeling great or anything like that (actually I felt really good every now and then) but 2 of us 4 said, they wouldn&#039;t take it again...<br />I thought, we should have gone out, walking, dancing anything (that was our plan anyway, but one just couldn&#039;t move, she was quite pale) - so for all of the four except me it was the firs time, for 2 the first time of drugs except pot in generall, and when I took it, twice before last friday, it was both at a party, with alcohol and dancing. but could that be all? wouldn&#039;t we have felt that way (like not good) if we went out?&nbsp; I was really dissapointed....is it possible that it was something else? I know that I have some problems with the curcuit sometimes with drugs...but everyone?? It was described so well, we didn&#039;t eat too much, we ate dark chocolate, drank grapefriut juice, drank enough, just a little alcohol......can somebody tell me their opinion? thanks a lot!

				If i have the powder and not pressed pills i prefer putting it in a tissue paper and just swallowing, much easier if you don&#039;t have anything. I heard snort will hit you faster but doesn&#039;t last as long, so your best bet would be to take it orally or up the arse lol. It&#039;s the same thing though, take it on a empty stomach :)

				My first time with MDMA I just took about 80mgs straight crystal/powder. No bombing just dropped it in my mouth and sipped some water to send it down. It took about 30min to set in and I ended up feeling really happy and content for a long while. I was happy just sitting around and enjoying the feel of the couch and the air and the sounds of my tv. <br /><br />Maybe your estimations were on the high side and you started with a little much? I think MDMA(like all drugs really but especially this) is a drug best started low to get a feel and then progress to higher doses at later dates.<br /><br />I hate to see a potential new fan get put off by a scary or bad first start. I&#039;d advise getting a reliable scale and get some proper dosages and get your friends to try 75-90mg and see what they get. It might be low but better low and enjoy it then high and get wrecked on side effects. <br /><br />Just my .02BC. Good luck and I hope you are gonna try it again!

				It is surprising since I always took like half a g of mdma and just probably wasted my money. But man I was rolling like a bitch. Now if I go clubbing, I do two doses, 175-200mg one capsule, re-dose the same amount after 2 hours. I made the mistake to always drop everything at once, and ended up wearing everything off during the middle of the club time. If you want to be up on your legs for 7 hours then re-dose!

				I think people are confusing molar weight and purity. This seems to happen in discussions about coke, too.<br />MDMA has a molecular weight of 193.2<br />The hydrochloride functional group has a molecular weight of 26.4<br />Therefore the molecular weight of MDMA.HCl, which is the crystalline form most commonly encountered is 229.6.<br />If you consume 100mg of MDMA.HCl then you&#039;re consuming about 84mg of MDMA.<br />If you want to consume 100mg of MDMA then you need to consume about 119mg of the hydrochloride salt.<br /><br />All of these calculations assume 100% pure MDMA and 100% pure MDMA.HCl.<br /><br />Given the concentration of hydrochloric acid in your stomach, it&#039;s perfectly sensible to consume 100mg of MDMA freebase on an empty stomach. It doesn&#039;t take noticeably longer to take effect than swallowing 120mg of the hydrochloride salt. If your stomach is not empty then this is no longer true, and the hydrochloride salt dissolved in water will hit you more quickly.<br />

				Hi All, Im a newbie here, just want to share my experience with the best was to take mdma, <br />Use to be and ehead in the 90&#039;s when you could get good beans on the street and rolled once or twice a month with friends. The problem i would run into was loosing my bean on the strong come-up due to puking.<br />so we did research and found that plugging them was a good was to get like 90-95% of the roll... and not have to worry about puking the pill up. so this became the norm.. i wouldnt think about eating and possably wasting <br />a good pill.... just a few words of caution... #1... dont try this if your new to using mdma... and #2.. um.. make sure you go to the bathroom before plugging... dont want to waste it&nbsp; ;)

I especially had problems with the circuit, was dizzy but also felt well again then. like always wanted to sit down again, but then again had to move. but nobody was really feeling great or anything like that (actually I felt really good every now and then) but 2 of us 4 said, they wouldn&#039;t take it again...<br />I thought, we should have gone out, walking, dancing anything (that was our plan anyway, but one just couldn&#039;t move, she was quite pale) - so for all of the four except me it was the firs time, for 2 the first time of drugs except pot in generall, and when I took it, twice before last friday, it was both at a party, with alcohol and dancing. but could that be all? wouldn&#039;t we have felt that way (like not good) if we went out?&nbsp; I was really dissapointed....is it possible that it was something else? I know that I have some problems with the curcuit sometimes with drugs...but everyone?? It was described so well, we didn&#039;t eat too much, we ate dark chocolate, drank grapefriut juice, drank enough, just a little alcohol......can somebody tell me their opinion? thanks a lot!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Urbana,<br />As another rather skinny girl I can tell you that your friends were definitely overwhelmed by the amount you took... If you have no experienced mdma or any other stimulating drug it&#039;d be hard to handle 100 mg of supertrips molly. I just had 5 grams as well and find that snorting a small started dose of about 80 mg and dipping my finger (yes licked) 2-3 times throughout the night will definitely have you going and feeling well. If you see that your friends or you are getting light headed you need to smoke some marijuana... honestly helps rid of all the jitters and brings on a more smooth feeling roll. Once you build up a tolerance, at least monthly user, you can snort about 150 mg and dip throughout the night... I find that crushing it all up and snorting it really is the only way to feel like I&#039;m rolling as when I take a capsule (pill) of molly I just don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m rolling hard enough for my wants.<br /><br />Find distractions... going out would have been a good idea... take vitamin c and b6 and b12 in rather heavy doses before rolling or tripping, helps you feel more balanced and energized not just an e zombie.... your brain gets tired of rolling after a while and you have eye wiggles and yawn a lot but cant sleep or even consider sleeping haha..<br /><br />overall, dont get discouraged, try again with different methods...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />can someone explain to me why snorting mdma is a waste? i usually find it to get the job done better than orally ingesting it

Outside of certain chemistry forums both extant and defunct almost nobody cares about the stoichiometric calculations and only cares about the weight of the end product.<br />With fresh and unconditioned synapses a 125mg initial dose of MDMA.HCl will probably be lovely. If you&#039;re one of the rare cases that doesn&#039;t get along with the chemical then 125mg isn&#039;t enough to get you into trouble. <br />I always have a sphygmomanometer and digital thermometer on hand to monitor people&#039;s blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature so that I&#039;m properly tooled up such that should someone exhibit distress I can tell whether they need to get into a bath of tepid water to bring their body temperature down. <br />Don&#039;t be put off by my cautionary words, but it wouldn&#039;t hurt to have a digital thermometer with you. In all the years of consuming MDMA with people I&#039;ve only ever once had to put a person in the bath.<br />Redosing once at 60-80mg if you feel you need it is apparently safe. Any more than one redose and any more than about 80mg without some hefty neuroprotective supplements and you&#039;re doing damage, and decreasing the number of magical experiences you can have.&nbsp; People who tell you otherwise generally lack anything like the proper grounding in the necessary sciences to be sharing anything other than an underinformed opinion.

				Wow man, thanks a lot. That&#039;s the kind of informed answer I was looking for. I&#039;d give you a bunch of karma if I could figure out how to do it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely have a thermometer with my while rolling.<br /><br />Last question, I swear: this will be my second experience with MDMA (first one wasn&#039;t planned, probably too low of a dose, awesome still), and I&#039;m extremely sensitive to chemicals. Do you think that I should probably start with a lower dose or can 125mg be considered completely safe? I definitely don&#039;t want to have a too violent onset. I&#039;ll be taking eazyjet&#039;s stuff (just ordered a gram).

Don&#039;t worry too much and enjoy the experience. Just make sure you keep hydrated (as I&#039;&#039;m sure a billion people said) and it&#039;s always good to have somebody watching your back when doing drugs but at 125mg you should be just fine. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh yeah, and fuck the thermometer. I get you&#039;re nervous about overheating but if you can remember to take a time-out and measure your body temp, you can go get a glass of damn water and take a few gulps every now and again. Seriously, I highly doubt you&#039;re going to burn up. If you and your buddies got a table or somethin, just sit a glass of water there (and a beer if you&#039;re inclined but watch the alcohol intake: keep it small) and remember to stop and drink every now and again. If you need more method to lessen your anxiety: every 3-4 songs or 15-30(depending on how crowded/intense it is) minutes take a breather for 2-5 minutes and sit down, drink your water, and go have a blast!

				This is just my 2cents. I&#039;ve taken 3(mixed) pills prior to this. I order a gram from a domestic source that just resells a NL source. I filled all my caps with 100mg due to my research that is the normal dosage. At the festival I took 1 pill and within 15 mins I could feel it coming on strong within the next 10 mins I was sitting on my gas. I was overwhelmed with the feeling! Next time I will probably fill 70-85mg and see what that does to me.<br /><br />3 days since I&#039;ve taken the mdma and I&#039;m depressed as fuck. Sucks but it will go away..

				Everyone is different - I don&#039;t get depressed coming off Molly.&nbsp; Quite the opposite - for about 36hrs after I have a nice warm afterglow.&nbsp; Sure the fuck beats a hangover!<br /><br />Seriously, Molly is such an easy-going drug.&nbsp; So benign and forgiving.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like 2CB where 5mg makes all the difference or anything.....heck, having half a dozen pints has a worse cost-to-reward ratio than 125mg of molly.<br /><br />I have no idea why the shit is banned.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking awesome.&nbsp; 8)

				i always find for the first go, lick your finger dip it in and lick it again (i realise thats not exactly rocket surgery, you might want a more specific amount, but really who goes clubbing with scales?)<br />or use a small key.<br /><br />&nbsp;meanwhile as for tolerance, my first few times with mdma (infact nearly all) i had a major booze problem, so id end up doing the whole gram, im not dead... although god knows i probably feltit, other than that for the first time maybe 1/3 or half a gram might be more than enough, you really dont need much the first few times, which is important to remember because your tolerance will grow, so you want to get the most out of it on your first go.<br /><br />Make sure you take a prozac next day, or even some 5htp to get your serotonin sorted back into whack.<br /><br />oh edit, i forgot to mention i was taking like 40mg prozac at the time, which probably offered me protections not available to others, so might be worth discarding my entire post

				The best and only way for me is not to take it at all - but thats not all of what I&#039;m gonna say that would be unnecessary.<br /><br />IMO the best way is to make a cup of tea and mix your MDMA inside - amount depending on potency. It kicks in fast and the perfect set and setting is a nice apartment with your loved one, a lot of candles, something to drink, a few pre-rolled spliffs and some good music. Enjoy, have sex and take a refill line. <br /><br />Pure MDMA - is there really anyone in the world who likes to party on just that without anything that keeps you awake? I know most mediocre weekend warriors thinks that MDMA is the best to go out and party with but that is because they&#039;ve never experienced pure MDMA - most common in Sweden/Switzerland are MDMA cut with speed.. MDA and other similar drugs. <br /><br />I have tried SuperTrips &amp; Sesampinos MDMA and what can I say - Sesampinos stuff made me super happy and trippy and 1 hour after ingestion I just wanted to go to bed and listen to music and smile for myself and friends and family experienced the same&nbsp; :o ;)
