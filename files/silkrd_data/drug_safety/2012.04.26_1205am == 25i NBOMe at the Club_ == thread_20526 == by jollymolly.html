				Is it safe to use 25i at the club because of vasoconstriction and all the dancing? I read on wikipedia that LSD causes it too but that seems to be relatively much safer. Anyone have any experiences with this at a show or anywhere?

Except for the indications that 25i overdoses have happened a few times before, whereas there has never been a single LSD overdose in the history of the world.

Even if you are a very experienced psychonaut, you should start slow with a drug you&#039;ve never done before. You never know if this particular drug will hit you strong because you lack some specific enzyme or something. It&#039;s been known to happen with DXM, for instance: some people are up to three times more sensitive to it than the rest of the population, and they only ever find out when they take the drug and start tripping hard as fuck.<br /><br />Imagine that with a psychedelic: You think you&#039;re in for a fun time with slight visuals and an uplifting feeling and suddenly you&#039;re in outer space surrounded by breathing waterfalls of incandescent purple music.

				&quot;So its visual and goofy- kinda like a very light candy flip. So I&#039;ve only taken one tab each time- but like you can hold intelligent conversations (or just any conversation) without the kind of mental fuckness acid can sometimes bring. Like sometimes when you&#039;re on L and you&#039;re trying to communicate with people not tripping or sober it can become a task- no problem here, I was wide awake ready to dance and laughing my ass off. It was a very social mix- enough of a speed up physical feel good without putting you in a &#039;roll&#039; and just enough of the trip without putting you on a different world. Lights look awesome, slight trail. Don&#039;t know how much more I can say about it, but I loved it- read up on some trip reports and then try some&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;dude...25i nbome is where its at.<br />heres a little about me:<br />i say less than 100 words a day unless i have to, or unless im drinking alcohol or on drugs.<br />i hate human contact...i think all humans are fucking stupid, myself included, and i also think that the more you talk the more chance you have of saying something stupid.<br />in high school i met a girl and went out with her for 3 years, after that ran its course i was so depressed i kinda quit being myself. i was just a different person, i had to re-think my values and what not, idk.<br />anyway, i just moved in with a new group of people, and stopped smoking weed for 2 weeks as a little experiment to see if that would help me hate people less and talk to people more. (i smoke weed like a jamaican)<br />it helped a little, but i still knew deep down that the more i talk the more chance i have of saying something dumb.<br />so I went back to staying high 16/8, and i realized that i would never like human contact without the help of something medicinal.<br />so I researched this same thing, and after a day or two i narrowed it down to a few things.<br />I tend to cheap out on things because of my excessive weed habit, so I opted for the 25i nbome.<br />I took 1mg or 1000ug of 25i nbome and let me tell you...it got me out of my shell.<br />besides cocaine its the best drug there is for talking to random people or people you don&#039;t like.<br />even a couple days after i take 25i nbome it makes me talkative and outgoing, and i don&#039;t like the thought of thinking humans are dumb and the more you talk the more stupid stuff you say.<br />for lack of a better term, it just makes me happy.<br />I suggest everyone try it.&quot;<br /><br />

I almost always go for milkdrop over itunes but I guess I was just lazy that night haha. I&#039;ll definitely try it for next time though!

				The wife and I did a half tab last week (550ug) and went out clubbing. It was absolutely PERFECT. I believe a full tab (1000ug) would have been too much. But that is just my opinion.
