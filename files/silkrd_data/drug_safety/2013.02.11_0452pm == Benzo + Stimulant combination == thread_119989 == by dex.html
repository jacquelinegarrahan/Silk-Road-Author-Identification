				How safe is combining stimulants with benzodiazepines? I&#039;ve heard conflicting things on both sides. <br />People have talked about their friends overdosing and dying taking meth with benzos but also I&#039;ve read that benzos are the recommended treatment for a stimulant overdose. <br />Before going out this week, I was thinking about taking 1 mg Alprazolam and then bombing about 80 mg mephedrone with about 40 mg mdma and bringing good blow. Does this seem like a safe cocktail or will I end up like Chris Farley?

				You should be fine with this combo. I think what you should or could be concerned about is the amount of stims you&#039;re gonna be taking. Just keep checking on yr heart and make sure it&#039;s not trying to leap out of yr chest lol. 1 mg alprazolam is fine, even 2 should be fine as well. Its when you take more than that that you can have a problem on yr hands.

				I think you&#039;ll be good as long as you don&#039;t inject the benzos. I&#039;ve mixed them several times orally in the past just fine, and every story I&#039;ve read/heard where someone died from mixing benzos with other stuff said they injected... so go with no vein no pain!<br /><br />Also - 1mg alpraz is not a lot, I can&#039;t imagine that bad of a reaction from 1 bar. I think 1mg is one bar, maybe it&#039;s 2mg. Hmm, anyway.

				that combo is safe but I wouldn&#039;t recommend that combo to anyone. If u ask me, just the alp and blow will provide u with good time. Believe me. I&#039;ve never done mephedrone, so can&#039;t help u there.<br />benzo + mdma = big waste<br />If ur trying to get fucked up, blow + mdma is a big waste too.&nbsp; <br />(Someone smart back me up with some brain chemistry, why these combos suck)<br /><br />Hope this helps

That said I think there are smaller bars that are 1mg and can also be broken into .5mg pieces.&nbsp; <br /><br />But yeah, that amount of alprazolam is pretty safe orally and you should be fine. Those numbers look like safe dosages on everything (although you didn&#039;t specify for the cocaine, I&#039;ll assume it&#039;s not some absurd amount). Just have fun and keep aware of what your body is telling you.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				please don&#039;t get into a habit with this if you really must try it. i&#039;ve spent the best part of a year trying to get someone out of this stim/benzo cycle of addiction, he&#039;s using one to offset the other and it has fucked with his behaviour so much, he&#039;s been off work &#039;sick&#039; for months, is completely socially isolated and regularly goes into states of drug (and insomnia) induced paranoid psychosis. it is pure hell not only for yourself but for those around you. the physical withdrawals from heavy benzo use are not fun.<br />make sure you got someone who knows what you&#039;ve taken or write it down somewhere just incase you forget. you might accidentally overdose if you get offered something else or if paramedics/doctors need to know what you&#039;ve taken and you&#039;re not conscious, it could save your life.

				It depends a bit on what you are using the benzo&#039;s for. Taking uppers and downers seems totally wasteful, but it doesn&#039;t always have to be.<br /><br />There are plenty of people that do it, a mug of coffee and a tablet of xanax in the morning to get them going and suppress anxiety problems during the day. There really isn&#039;t that much wrong with doing that, but if you take benzo&#039;s for sedative effects in combination with a stimulant it will be a rather odd experience. This could lead to using high doses of both without getting much benefit from either.
