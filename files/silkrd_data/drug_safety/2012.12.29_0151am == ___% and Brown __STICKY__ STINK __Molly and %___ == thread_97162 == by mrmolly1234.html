				Hi all, 1st I would like to thank everyone for any help feedback. Got some great molly off the road a few times, small moon rocks of white maybe a little yellow but toatlly white when crushed. Amazing rolls. Anyways my favorite vendor was selling very dark mdma which I read was bad not properly washed etc. So I decided to try a new vendor with great feedback tons of transaction great reviews. His looked to be the same off white ive been getting. Anyways I get the package fast but what i find inside im not to happy with. Everything is already crushed and it is brown/light brown, def not tan but BROWN. It does not have the shimmer or crystaly look my other stuff had when held in the light. It smeels VERY strongly of liquorice where my other stuff was very faint smell. It is also somewhat sticky, sticks to the bag a little more and also if I squeze it together it clups together momentairly. Now here is the kicker, i did marquise mecke and simons test and it passed with flying colors, very fast and strong reaction mdma positive. And alot of other people gave this product great reviews saying it was flame. Im big on harm reduction and have been piped in the past horrible time and actully thats how i found this site ;) So what does everyone think? Throw it out and get new stuff only a g not much of a loss, try acatone wash? Never done before but think I can after reading about it. Leave as is and try a small test dose 1st, thx for your help everyone

				The tests kits you are using don&#039;t test for adulterants, cuts, or purity. Merely the presence or absence of MDMA. <br /><br />A lot of vendors will try to defend the brown / off-coloured stuff but if it&#039;s brown it means at the very least : <br /><br />- It&#039;s made in a shitty backyard lab<br />- It&#039;s not pure<br />- It&#039;s still got precursor chemicals in it<br /><br />Finding &quot;pure&quot; white MDMA made in a real lab is like finding a unicorn though. Brown still gets you were you want to go, and if you take illegal drugs you&#039;ve probably already ingested lots of cuts and precursors over time anyway.

				Thanks for the fast replies everyone, well on a side note the reactions are very strong and fast compared to quality pills ive tested and verified on pillreports. So is the general idea that its just poor quilty with precursor but shouldnt be that big a deal? I was piped before so i just never want someing like thatto happen again fuck bzp ftw

				do an acetone wash. there are guides for that on the forum.<br /><br />acetone<br />epsom salts (bake in oven for 2 hours) put into the acetone <br />that removes the water, mdma is water soluble, by taking out the water you raise your mdma yield.<br /><br />put crushed powder (as fine as possible) in a coffee filter, pour acetone over it, rinse and repeat.<br /><br />let the wet mdma in the filter dry for some hours, or put in oven at very low temperature.<br /><br />acetone forms explosive gases inside, be sure to have a window open, dont smoke close to it.<br /><br />profit

				Please rename the topic. I was wondering whats in the other 20% of 80% pure mdma. Is it harmful does it depend on the ingredients or the both ingredients and way of making it idk what mdma was studyed in the http://thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html study I guess random (maybe for a certain area).
