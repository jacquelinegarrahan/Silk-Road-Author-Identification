				my roommate and i have been trying to explore the psychadelic properties of ketamine and have found that sometimes in a deep k-hole, we feel similar effects to that of DMT. has anyone combined the two drugs for the purpose of consciousness expansion? if so, what were your results? we are looking into trying the combination, as we have never tried it before.&nbsp; we are both experienced ketamine and dmt users as well as other psychadelics.&nbsp; we are looking for feedback. thanks to all!

				i am planning to try and time it to peak at the same time. so maybe snort a line of k, ranging from 150-250mg, wait about 15-20 minutes and blast off. thanks for the encouraging words!

				I&#039;ve done it. Probably the most intense experience I&#039;ve had under the effect of psychedelics or dissociatives.

				I used 50mg ketamine IN then 30-40 mg DMT when I was doing this combo<br /><br />FAIR WARNING- I have no HX of mental illness in my family- I abused this combo over a few months, maybe 1 or twice a week, and the last time I did it, I shattered my ego into 3 pieces. It was the most frightening experience of my life. I thought I had permanently lost it- 3 voices all screming at eachother in my head. after 3 hours I was still experiencing the ego fighting. Luckily, when I woke up the next day I was only depressed and mentally dull. It was the K that did it. If you read up on long term use of K, you&#039;ll see that many people develop a signature egoic condition.<br /><br />My advice is to keep the experience pure with DMT. if you have some sort of anxiety which makes you want to loosen up with k first, listen to the DMT spirits about why/where the anxiety is coming from, and change your life accordingly. <br /><br />Happy soul searching!

				thanks turningjapanese!!! i am extremely comfortable with both DMT and K. i have done a lot of K and i have noticed with certain types of K, particularly MarcelKetman&#039;s Inresa Ketamine that I experienced DMT-like trips.&nbsp; i have gone deep into k holes with complete loss of surroundings and higher entity callings and feelings.&nbsp; i am trying to see if there is any connection to combining the two and what kind of reaction the mixture has in people. in what order and how long apart did you do each drug?

				If you do this combo DO NOT do high doses of both. Ketamine is a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor and DMT is an agonist. It isn&#039;t safe to take high doses of both.

				My dosages, if I recall were somewhere in the range of 75-90mg ketamine (insufflated) and 60-70mg DMT. It&#039;s been a while and if I took notes of it I no longer know where they are but I believe those numbers are fairly close. Great experience that I would be happy to do again.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

It is an intense mind fuck and, administered properly and at high enough doses, probably the strongest psychedelic experience you will have. <br /><br />That said, let&#039;s say you disregard that (you&#039;re the authority on how your body/mind works), it depends a lot on how you administer the dose. More than any drug I&#039;ve had it can be tricky to vaporize in a manner that works and is not wasteful. Assuming good quality DMT and average vaporizing technique (even if you do your research you will probably need practice to optimize your vape&#039;ing). I would say start with 35mg. Too much lower and if you fuck up the vape process you will only get enough to screw your tolerance for the evening. You could even push to 40 or 45mg but I would strongly advise against that. It&#039;s extremely potent for a drug and I encourage you to respect the potential of it. <br /><br />Do it in a vaporizer or pack it between some ash/weed/other product in a bong and either take one huge bong rip that burns(vapes) through the product or take three huge hits from a vaporizer. Either way hold the hits for at least 10 seconds (longer if you can but unlikely) and let it out and lay back and be careful with any fragile pieces or things around you. Having someone with you would be ideal<br /><br />It&#039;s fun and, despite a lot of cautionary tales, I&#039;ve never had a bad experience with DMT (harsh as hell to hit though). <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

Don&#039;t do it. If you have issues with your own mental health it would not be advisable to potentially exacerbate that problem. DMT is probably one of the most, if not the most, powerful drugs you can take.

				I&#039;m happy to help. I know I&#039;ve disregarded way more harm reduction advice than I&#039;ve taken but I feel I use (everything) pretty responsibly so I hope I don&#039;t come across as obnoxious. I just try to put some harm reduction encouragement in my posts in this topic area. That said, from your experience it sounds like there&#039;s little chance of a psychotic episode (and you don&#039;t seem to think so either which is the important part. Side note: I believe that our expectations and beliefs have a strong effect on drugs--so if you don&#039;t believe DMT can mess with your head in a way you don&#039;t want it to, I think that reduces the chance of it being able to do so). <br /><br />In regards to taking turns: it&#039;s such a short-lasting effect that if you two are both using the same piece it will likely not be feasible to try to blast off at the same time. Also, since it is at least your first time, it would probably be better that he or she can keep an eye on you. <br /><br />It&#039;s all in how you do it. I usually use a small, handheld vape and have had a friend do their full three hits and then loaded my pre-measured dose, dropped mine in, and hit mine and joined them in about 90 seconds so if your friend is quick, and has made sure you are comfortable(for me it usually ends up being slouched into whatever furniture I&#039;m sitting in) then you can both blast off together but, even though you&#039;ll be doing it together, the two of you will be worlds apart.<br /><br />I hope you have a blast--it&#039;s really an amazing experience and it&#039;s nice to be able to do it and come back in a short amount of time (although it can feel like forever).<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				I just tried this combo for the first time today.&nbsp; i have to say, it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />i kept it low on both fronts.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t measure but i did two very small little bumplets of K and after about 5 or 10 min I started smoking the DMT.&nbsp; took a couple small hits and then one medium hit and really got an awkward vibe from it.&nbsp; it was like i was dissociated from my dmt experience....also, the visuals were less colorful for some reason.&nbsp; Also, i like to be aware/sober/alert when i go into a DMT session so going into to it essentially paralyzed had me feeling a little vulnerable, i guess.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t really kick it into high gear with the DMT; just let it fade away then I nodded off for about 20 min from the K.&nbsp; I came out of it feeling pretty good, actually, but i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll be trying this again anytime soon.&nbsp; for now, DMT is interesting enough to me on its own.
