				Hi all! So for those of you that read my random posts throughout SR you&#039;ll know that I recently decided to have a non-traditional wedding with my lovely girlfriend that consisted of getting a pair of matching tattoos and spending a weekend locked in a beautiful hotel room to celebrate an occasion we dubbed our Drugimoon. The plan went off without a hitch and I wanted to follow back up with the hows and what&#039;s of the weekend in case anyone ever wanted to give something similar a try.<br /><br />The supplies:<br /><br />15 Grams of GHB<br />10 Grams of mushrooms<br />25 200mg MDMA pills<br />3.5 Grams High quality weed<br />1 Gram MDA<br />100 mg Moxy (5-meo-mipt)<br />100 mg Alprazolam powder<br />100 MG 2CB<br /><br />The first night we dropped 12mg Moxy each (made my girl giggle like made, not terribly sexual), 2 grams of shrooms each, 200mg of MDMA, 300mg of MDA each in two doses, smoked a good deal of weed and ended the night with some Alprazolam to help us sleep... took a little too much, went to bed at 6:00 am and woke up at about 4:00 PM. <br /><br />The goal wasn&#039;t to fuck all night, we get to do that whenever we want, it was just to get as high as we reasonably could and towards that end we fared well. We were both a little sad that we hadn&#039;t consumed enough to make us puke as that is normally something we manage on most of our adventures but we were okay with it. I was slightly higher than my girl off the shrooms and she a little higher than I off the Moxy but otherwise we kept pace with each other for most of the night.<br /><br />The next afternoon we got some food, ate as much as we could and decided to get high some more.<br /><br />The second night went something like this. 3.5 grams of GHB each. We both felt it a little but could have used much more. The effects were sort of dull compared to maybe a few beers if anything. 12mg Moxy was then followed by 2 grams of shrooms for me and 3 grams for her. We chased that with a few MDMA pills in quick order (about an hour apart) and then dosed the remaining 200mg MDA each. Time got a little confusing at this point but I know we did a bit of 2CB followed by some Moxy and some the rest of the shrooms. We eventually ended the night much later than we had planned at about 5:00 AM and set the alarm for 10:30 AM before taking a small amount of Alprazolam to get us some sleep.<br /><br />Again, the goal was to get really high and we pulled it off wonderfully. A gram of MDA, 6 200mg MDMA pills, 7 grams GHB, 50mg of Moxy, about 1g of great weed, as well as some 2CB and Alprazolam to round things out for the weekend. The next morning was slow but not impossible. We made it home and slept in shifts for a while getting back to a normal schedule. The day after that we were mostly normal with a few extra naps and now a few days out feel right as rain again.<br /><br />My little bit of sorrow for the weekend binge comes from the fact that I had really wanted to Candy-Flip but the guy I ordered the LSD from was the only vendor who didn&#039;t come through in time. The shrooms were an okay alternative but I had experienced stomach discomfort with them before and didn&#039;t go all in like I would have with the LSD. When we do it again, I&#039;ll plan on putting the LSD order in long in advance and I think I am going to mix in some Stims to setup at least one all nighter so we don&#039;t have to bother with all that downtime for sleep. I was going to try for some meth this round but it&#039;s so hard to mix that with anything I decided to stay with the love drugs.<br /><br />All in all we had two days of being comfortably stoned but we didn&#039;t push it too far because I think we both wanted to enjoy a good time rather than find the breaking point of how high we could get. The amounts we did were still a little crazy but we seem to be pretty good troopers with most of the drugs we played with. I&#039;m going to give GHB another go in bigger doses over time to see if there&#039;s a sweet spot for us. Next time I think I&#039;d like to push the Moxy a little further to see where the psychedelic aspects kick in. Also, since the shrooms went down so well this time I&#039;ll stop being a sissy and take a bigger dose next time. Off my 2 gram fix I was seeing some shit move but it wasn&#039;t as far as I could go and my girl didn&#039;t quite get there.<br /><br />Anyways, one of our brilliant drug induced ideas was that we can celebrate an anniversary on any date we like. As a non-traditionalist, I hate having to remember specific days so the making up our own days whenever we feel like celebrating our relationship just makes more sense. So this post will likely be followed up with round two at some point!
