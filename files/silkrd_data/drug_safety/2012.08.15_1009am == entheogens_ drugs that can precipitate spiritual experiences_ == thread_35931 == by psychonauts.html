				For your spiritual side the general advice would be <br /><br />Ayahuasca, mescaline, pure DMT, LSD, shooms, all are self regulating in one form or another., and chemically non addictive. Because a drug is non addictive doesn&#039;t mean that it doesn&#039;t have downsides.<br /><br />Even ones that put you in touch with God.<br /><br />Go and surf the DMT nexus and Erowid for your sources of good quality information on entheogens.

				In my experience spirtual trips are based around setting. I&#039;m not a traditionally spiritual person, yet sometimes ill have a unexpected powerful spiritual experience out of nowhere whilst tripping. I&#039;ve heard from a few LSD veterans that the visuals of a trip are very distracting and in order to maximize the spiritual aspect of it your vision must be obscured. A few tips they&#039;ve mentioned are to use a blindfold (but keep a friend near by, or even better, a spouse or loved one), or to turn all of the lights off. My most spiritual experience with psychedelics was outside in the middle of the day, playing my bass guitar while my other two friends played their respective instruments ( drums and guitar). So if you play a musical instrument its something to consider. Also, please don&#039;t keep upping your doses chasing a spiritual trip, you may end up with an experience you find less than ideal.<br /><br /><br />Be safe.<br /><br />Shifty

				You still have to make a distinction between a &quot;spiritual&quot; experience and a pleasant one. <br /><br />Just because people felt profoundly insightful, and found &quot;deep meaning&quot;, there&#039;s little to indicate proof of the divine or metaphysical in these studies. If anything, that fact that these feelings can be induced through chemistry is proof they are manifested in the physical brain.&nbsp;

Whether we attribute it to something metaphysical or something tangible such as chemicals in the brain, its still a prevalent part of our lives and can greatly influence our world-views.

				Yeh +1 Shifty, tend to agree. Ultimately it can be a wholly edifying and insightful experience - whether or not it is technically &quot;spiritual&quot; in the &quot;entheogen&quot; sense of the word. The human mind is awe inspiring.

				Spirituality means something regarding the fundamental essence of consciousness. Any time we choose to live or make decisions in a self-aware way, we open the door to spiritual experiences—experiences where we are exceptionally aware of the fact that we are living.<br /><br />The nature of psychedelic drugs is to alter consciousness quickly. Because consciousness only notices changes in things, psychedelic drugs can give some people a more direct route to seriously confronting questions about the nature of existence, the self, and what reality is like.<br /><br />Sex, the creation of art, and practices such as meditation and &quot;metaprogramming&quot; can, if we so choose, allow us to more fully exalt, and even surpass, the usual capacity of our being. These &quot;peak experiences&quot; happen when your mind is significantly undergoing a decrease in entropy, and becoming a more well-ordered, simple and efficient system.

				Well .. to be clear the etymology of &quot;spiritual&quot; is the latin &quot;spiritus&quot; which literally means &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;. It has always referred to the afterlife or non-physical. New-agers have picked up that, inferring that the non physical &quot;soul&quot; is responsible for your consciousness. <br /><br />I don&#039;t believe in ghosts, so I disagree with that, which is my core problem with the word &quot;spiritual&quot;.&nbsp;

				On topic:<br />I found mescaline was pretty powerful, and reasonably benign. We prepared it from San Pedro cactus during the day, and took it at dusk. It tasted most foul, the onset was a challenge, and the trip was encompassing and engrossing, and everyone claimed to have taken away useful experiences and lessons. There were some manageably terrifying experiences, and they were useful too, but largely the trip was benign, and seemed to predispose us to thoughts about nature. Best experiences were in an isolated forest with no risk of interruption by outsiders who weren&#039;t tripping.<br />The one person who took it &quot;for fun&quot; said it certainly wasn&#039;t the fun he&#039;d expected.<br />Urban environments were more challenging, but provided the house had a decent garden for when there was a compulsion to see living green things it was OK.<br /><br />None of us had any compulsion to take it again quickly, and this is apparently the typical response.<br /><br />Rambling on, around, or near the topic:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35931.msg410169#msg410169">Quote from: TheBusiness on August 15, 2012, 02:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Drugs are not a pathway to spirituality.

I think the investigation of the neurological science of spirituality is going to be fascinating. Warped scrying glass firmly affixed, visible futures include a sense of deep spiritual satisfaction form paying one&#039;s taxes. Having the instruments to make a clinically sensible decision about one&#039;s life trajectory and experience ecstatic bliss from executing the necessary actions even if they are boring. Alteration of the would-be psychopath such that they extract fulfillment from gardening. Absolution of tax-free status from commercial organisations using spirituality to avoid their fiscal obligations to society.<br />ahem.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35931.msg413260#msg413260">Quote from: marcopolo on August 16, 2012, 10:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A followup study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience.

Two people can view the same reality, and one may see deeper patterns quicker than the other. It is normal and common to be able to sense a pattern that a friend cannot—even if you try to explain it to them. Often we are looking in different directions. Communication, and the beauty of language allow us to share and exchange patterns— but only to those who have an earnest desire to apprehend that new pattern which was not previously part of their concept of reality.

It can also happen spontaneously without the use of drugs (so-called mystical psychosis). I had my first spiritual experience at the age of 20, long before I tried any psychedelic drugs, and the experience was identical to the central element of my best LSD trips -- ego death, loss of boundaries between self and environment, the disintegration of the &quot;I&quot; making way for the eternal and spiritual &quot;not-I&quot;, a timeless awareness and unitive knowledge of the Eternal Now and divine Ground of all existence. But these are all loathsome abstractions: language cannot describe a spiritual experience. It can happen on LSD, and it can also happen through spiritual training and spontaneous religious experiences.<br /><br />Anyone seeking to have a spiritual experience with psychedelics should do so in conjunction with discipline and meditation.

For example certain pictures that make absolutely no sense when sober, come alive in something better than 3D when on Lucy, and I have this cross referenced with people who were also high with me at the time. What is more, we all saw the exact same things in these stills which goes to show we were not all imagining different things, but instead we were all seeing more clearly for the first time.&nbsp; The video in question is this: (try watching when on LSD)<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpKXnrmwNT8<br /><br />All in all LSD for me is a kind of &quot;shortcut&quot; to a spiritual experience. There are other ways I have come close (namely meditation) but LSD - Weed simply remove many barriers much faster and I reach my dharma place every time - a place where all my life questions are solved the moment I put them in my head :)

				Just about every drug (in the appropriate dosage) can give you a spiritual experience, for a given value of spiritual. It really depends a lot on what you expect from such an experience. I suspect that very few people with no idea about spiritual stuff call their experiences spiritual. Maybe insightful, maybe just balls awesome. Spiritual people call those experiences spiritual because that&#039;s their deal. The things that we see on a trip might not directly be within our control, but we do control how we interpret them. Our internal psychology will determine how we do that.<br /><br />It&#039;s like an ink blot test. Show the same things to four different people, one of them sees clouds, one sees their father, one sees jesus and another sees rob zombie. All these things do is tell you more about yourself. If you believe there is some degree of divinity in human kind (either as gods children, as part of the greater whole of nature or whatever else) then gleaning understanding of yourself&nbsp; brings you closer to the divine, and thus is religious. If you don&#039;t believe that, but are philosophically inclined, then self-knowledge is worthwhile per se. If you are just a hedonist, then pretty pictures are fun. <br /><br />No drug can show you the face of god, sorry. But they can make you think about yourself and by extension the nature and role of a god in new and interesting ways.

				Very good point l0574l0ne, coming to think about it I twice did LSD with a friend, the same batch, experiencing the same things, but it seemed that I was on higher planes than him all the time with the major difference between us that I&#039;m generally more into continuously developing my spiritual side while he is into drugs purely for the fun aspect of them. So when I was having revelations that pushed my high higher higher he was still grounded cause he never put the right seeds in his mind to trigger any sort of revelation.&nbsp; In contrast, with some more spiritual friends I&#039;ve done LSD with the experience was much stronger for them, and they helped bring me even higher. So there seems to be some relation to how &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;high frequency&quot; a person is already in his life for what LSD will do for him. It&#039;s the same concept why they say it&#039;s good to cleanse yourself (both mind and body) before you trip.. you prepare your self to be in the best form to receive whatever it is that we receive through LSD.

				I first took mushrooms when I was 15-16 and spent 5 hours just thinking about everything. During the trip, I understood that animals feel pain and want to survive just as much as I do, and this lead to me no longer consuming meat. I&#039;ve also experienced ego death, and taking mushrooms has enabled me to feel more of a connection with and respect for the Earth. <br /><br />I believe that these chemicals should be treated with respect, and I&#039;ve known people who took them merely for shits and gigs and were unprepared for what they experienced. <br /><br />
