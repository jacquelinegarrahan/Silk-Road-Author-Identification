				So yeah, I know this isn&#039;t all that dangerous, but I received some candy with my order (surprise!), and I have never done/taken edibles before. Anything I should know ahead of time? How long does it typically take to kick in? My family is going out of town this weekend, so it is a perfect time to try something new. :D

				The most important thing to note is that edibles can take a WHILE to kick in. I have had them take over an hour/hour and a half to fully hit me. Don&#039;t make the mistake of not waiting long enough and then eating more if you don&#039;t want to risk getting super fucked up. As for the high, I have found it&#039;s more of a body buzz, with psychedelic features like colour enhancement and so on. They also last much longer than smoking a joint, sometimes I&#039;ll be quite high off a cookie for 2-3 hours.&nbsp;

				Cool, thanks. The closest I have ever been to edibles was when the bong water back-washed into my mouth. :)

				Edibles of what substance?<br /><br />I recall eating a few slices of spacecake (edible cannabis) as a teen, which took several hours to take effect. Inexperienced as i was i figured they were just not effective.. until it hit me in full force whilst being at home with my parents. I barely made it up the stairs to &#039;do something on the computer&#039;, and decided to smoke the stuff from that point on ;)

				I was wondering this same thing, as I haven&#039;t tried them, I see a lot that say the number of milligrams per candy.&nbsp; So if you smoke dank, say every other day, once a day, how long would 50mg&nbsp; give you a buzz for?&nbsp; Just an estimate would be good to know.&nbsp; I ate brownies once in college and probably ate too much but I remember just laying on the floor and tripping out on the ceiling for a couple hrs, really wasn&#039;t the most pleasant experience.. lol&nbsp; But may give it another try if can control the dose.
