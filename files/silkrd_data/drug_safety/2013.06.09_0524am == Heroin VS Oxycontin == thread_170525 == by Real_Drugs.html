				I, as well as a few others in the community I presume would like to know the differences between heroin and OC as well as other key info. <br /><br />My reason for posting is that I love a bit of OC from time to time but would never touch heroin, my friend tells me that there is really minimal difference but I believe otherwise. Does anyone want to shine some light?

				there both opiates besides that i think your friend is wrong. there worlds apart<br />oxycontin is an extended release oxycodone pill. even if you crush it and then sniff/bang the high is not great. if you had nothing to compare it too then it feels good. numb, sleepy, mood lift from being stoned. it feels like most of the weaker opiates like codeine and hydrocodeine<br />morphine, heroin and hydromorphone are a different sport. heroin high is strong euphoria, blissfulness, a warm blanket, heavy nods<br />feels about a million times better and the withdrawals are a million times worse<br />i only use oxycodone to combat junk withdrawals now, i wouldnt even consider it a high compared to the H

				yes codeine is very weak, but i put it in the same basket as oxycodone and hydrocodone. they are the weak opiates. codeine and hydrocodone are pretty much useless unless your a 12 year old girl on her period. oxycodone is the strongest out of the bunch but the feeling is similar just stronger. it lacks the opium orgasm that heroin, morphine and hydromorphone bring. a lot of people think pushing off on H feels better then sex. now i&#039;m not convinced about that, without a doubt on some days it comes real close. i dont think anyone would compare an oxy to that sort of pleasure. <br />

Potency does not equal strength. Heroin is on a higher level than oxy/hydrocodone which are on a higher level than codeine. I can&#039;t get much from codeine after doing heroin. They&#039;re worlds apart.

				I don&#039;t even list codeine when I talk about opiates. Not only does it make me sick, it&#039;s weak as hell. I&#039;ve never had an opiate dependence, but if I did, I wouldn&#039;t even take codeine to combat the withdrawals.

				I agree, codeine makes me feel like I&#039;m coming down off of OC, I feel nauseous and get headaches from it.
