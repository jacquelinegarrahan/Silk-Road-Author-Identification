				how much should be enough for a good roll? I haven&#039;t used MDMA in a very long time so I have no tolerance, I&#039;m also around 155lbs. So would 110mg of MDMA be enough?

				Apparently, the optimal dosage of MDMA is 1.5mg/kg of body weight. 155lbs is roughly 70kg, so that would mean 105mg would be ideal for you. I&#039;m sure your original dose idea of 110mg would work perfectly. Enjoy :)

				ok thanks so much! I just wanted to make sure one capsule is gonna be enough. I have two 110mg mdma capsules for my girl and I but my selfishness wanted to pop them both but at the same time I want to share the mdma experience with my girl. So from the sound of everything we both should have a amazing roll

				If it&#039;s good MDMA, then 110mg should be fine, and you&#039;re way better off sharing with your gf than taking both yourself. One caution on capsules... I got an entire batch of capsules one time that didn&#039;t dissolve worth a shit.&nbsp; Super exceptionally pure MDMA in those sort of sucked, and it was a big problem. The two best solutions were to either open the capsules before taking them, or taking them anally - the best route for taking MDMA, IMHO, just a little inconvenient in many situations.

				If you want a more speedy/intense roll, you can always snort it. But then again, it will be a shorter roll.<br />I think 110mg is gunna be a nice euphoric time&nbsp; :)

				I would agree with psychmind, anywhere between 1.5mg/kg and 2.5mg/kg throughout the night should be plenty.&nbsp; Refer to the Erowid MDMA dosage chart for more information.&nbsp; However, it also depends on purity of your gear.&nbsp; I just got some fire MDMA from luckylucianno and I wouldn&#039;t dare start with a whole point of his stuff.&nbsp; I had a friend take a single point and said it was the most intense roll experience he&#039;s ever had.&nbsp; If you decide to redose, I would recommend taking between 1/3 and 1/2 your initial dose, to prevent potential neurotoxicity<br /><br />Remember you can always take more, you can never go back and take less when you&#039;re feeling too high/overstimulated.

				A threshold dose of MDMA is 80mg...a low dose is 100 - 150mg a medium dose is 150mg to 200mg is a high dose.... You d need to factor in body mass and tolerance to substances over all not just MDMA...<br /><br />&nbsp;You will need to make sure that nether of you are on SSRIs or MAOIs ....If you are on a SSRI you wont roll if you are on a MAOI it can kill you<br /><br />If you are going to take it orally.. you need to have an empty tummy... NO eating for 4 to 6 hours before AND when you do eat that morning make it lite like fruit <br /><br />If you only have 110mg each.. I would do it Sublingual&nbsp; ...&nbsp; BRUSH your teeth and gums... Use mouth wash if you have it and then empty the cap under your tongue and&nbsp; &nbsp;allow it to dissolve there.. Do not swallow your spit! allow it too collect&nbsp; do this as long as you can 10 mins is good 20 is GREAT you will roll much harder this way.. <br /><br />the other option for a low dose like this to get the most of it would be to plug it.. I&#039;m not going to go into detail on that as I don&#039;t want to feed trolls on the topic if you wish to PM me you can and I will there.. <br /><br />Get your selves some 5 hour energies and shoot them after you swallow all the B vits are great for you and will feed the roll.. Some 5-HTP after the roll will help you sleep at 200mg and if you take at least 100mg for a few days after you should avoid the &quot;Tuesday blues&quot;<br /><br />just my 2cts..
