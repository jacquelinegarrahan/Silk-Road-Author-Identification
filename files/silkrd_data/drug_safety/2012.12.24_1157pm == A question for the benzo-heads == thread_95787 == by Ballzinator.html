				That&#039;s not a lot of alprazolam<br />Decent amount of diazepam<br />lorazepam is decent<br />oxazepam sucks<br /><br />I&#039;d say personally for me diazepam or lorazepam due to the larger amount and longer half-lives.

				Lorazepam is indeed a wide spectrum benzo, having anxiolytic, hypnotic and relaxant properties in fair proportions.<br /><br />Still, i have my doubts with the recreational value of benzo&#039;s in general. Personally i&#039;ve experienced little recreational effect from any benzo, apart from the sensation of being a bit drunk and sleepy - perhaps comparable to day of hard work and then having a few beers after. <br /><br />If you actually took the 20 mg of lorazepam in a single serving i&#039;n sure the effect would be profound. I wonder if that effect would be all that pleasurable though, unless you want to be knocked out&nbsp; for a day and a half and come too with little recollection of how you even got there. <br /><br />

				If you have doubts on the recreational potential of benzodizepines get ahold of some temazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, or midazolam. <br /><br />

Perhaps that was good fun, but what is the point of having fun when you do not remember having it?

				It would seem so, but at high dosages people can actually do pretty odd things on the combination of alcohol and benzo&#039;s, and mostly not remember any of it the next day.<br /><br />Flutrinazepam and temazepam have a bad reputation where that is concerned, although the effect is not limited to only those 2 specific substances. <br /><br />You get the odd story every now and then about this, such as people taking a piss in the isle on an airplane and such. I suppose this mostly happens to inexperienced users - its a combination of limited faculties due to alcohol and benzodiazepines combined with being in an unusual and constrictive environment i assume. Also, itis not that common - on a long haul flight you can expect a large portion of the passengers to be on a combo of benzo&#039;s and onboard served alcohol. Most of them simply doze off and come too when breakfast is served just before landing.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem to be that uncommon a thing to do - i&#039;ve found empty blisters of benzo&#039;s on many flights just popping out of the back of the seat in front of me when grabbing the in flight magazine. Too bad they were always empty ;)
