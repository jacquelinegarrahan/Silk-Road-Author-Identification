				Due to various circumstances, I can&#039;t/won&#039;t IV substances anymore. I&#039;m by no means a heroin addict, perhaps shooting once a week, so I&#039;m not looking for advice as to help quitting. Rather, I&#039;m asking for good opiates that are enjoyable swallowed or sniffed. I sniff heroin every once in a while, but I don&#039;t enjoy it as much as, say, swallowing a percocet 30mg.<br /><br />Any advice as to what you prefer is much appreciated. In addition, if you find some opiates cause worse side effects than others (excessive puking, headaches, whatever), that info is welcome. Thanks.

				Oxycodone and Morphine pills are probably best for taking orally. I really wouldn&#039;t recomend sniffing any kind of pills at all though. There are so many binders that its just a waste.

				Tramadol is pretty awesome. You should try it. It&#039;s an SSRI and an Synthetic Opiate.<br /><br />Take 3 at the same time to feel really really good. Take another one 1 hour later to nod for a bit 8)<br /><br />Take 5-9 and feel super crazy/fucked up.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I used to take tramadol a lot. It&#039;s a nice mix with 10mg of Hydrocodone 8)

Anyway, to the OP, I feel H is the king of opi&#039;s but I also love the needle. If you are looking to avoid the spike I&#039;d say oxycodone and fent are my other favs, and they can easily be used without injection. Just curious though, have you ever tried smoking heroin? It is a different high IMO.

				I&#039;ve only tried smoking it, I&#039;m too much of a pussy and I&#039;m scared of picks, and I highly recommend trying hammer thru a sweet puff!<br />

				Never tried smoking it, no. Wasn&#039;t really on my to-do list, but if you guys vouch for it, I&#039;ll look into it.<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies. I&#039;ll probably attempt oxy first, as an old friend routinely texts me and asks if I&#039;ve gotten any.
