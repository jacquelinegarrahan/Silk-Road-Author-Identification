				Okey, where i live, in (skandinavia) they sell this shitt on the street, if your lucky you get realy bad hash, but many times you get som other shitt that isnt hash at all..<br />what is this? ive heard it could be henna paint? Do they buy herbal hash and sell it?&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />and when its bad hash do they mix it with something?<br />just curious, its not often ive buy from this people, but sometimes if im drunk and in a hurry... Ive been in allot of other countrys and then at least what you get is hash not some other shitt..<br />sry for my bad written english, im getting bether&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;m not from Scandinavia, so cannot say for sure what adulterants (pollutants) are in your hash, here&#039;s a list of the ones commonly found:<br /><br />Animal turds, aspirin, barbiturates, beeswax, boot polish, glues and dyes, ground coffee, henna, ketamine, milk powder, pine resin, turpentine, and carcinogenic solvents such as toluene and benzene.<br /><br />Soapbar is the worst offender of polluted hash, if it&#039;s not too polluted, it&#039;s possible to clean it.<br /><br />In a saucepan, boil up a small amount of water (2cm or so). Add your polluted sample of soap. Slow down to a simmer and gently crush the hash block with a spoon. It&#039;s likely the water will turn yellow, this is due to the henna, or worse, dissolving cut. When the hash is completely powdered up, drain off the water, and add the remaining powder onto kitchen towels to dry out. As cannabis oils are insoluble in water the potency of what remains will not be too badly damaged. The downside is that you&#039;ll have a considerably smaller stash, the upside is that you&#039;ve purified your stash, making for a safer and healthier smoke. This method is not recommend to clean quality hash (there&#039;s no need to clean just enjoy it!), this method is only recommend for polluted hash.<br /><br />Hope this helps you :)

				Oh well, people sell all kinds of stuff for cannabis on the streets. What is in them depends on where you are, but its usually a leftover product.<br /><br />I remember smoking a &#039;joint&#039; in laos, which came pre-rolled and looked find, despite tasting a bit odd. Surely gave me a bit of a high initially, but a few hours later i found myself staring at the ceiling in agony. This only lasted an hour or two, and i suppose the active ingredient in that &#039;joint&#039; must have been some opium waste product. I was okay the next day and never suffered any adverse effects after, but it did prove the theory that &quot;that was NOT weed&quot;.
