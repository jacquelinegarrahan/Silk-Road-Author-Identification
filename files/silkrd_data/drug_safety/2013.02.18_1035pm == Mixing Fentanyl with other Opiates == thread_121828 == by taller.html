				hi! i have done many different opiates in the past and also have a small tolerance to them, but i don&#039;t take them frequently. since there is some high quality fentanyl powder sold on here i am very interested in that. i am using it in a nasal spray with accurate concentration (100mcg-200mcg per puff). i really like the effects of it but it&#039;s much lacking in euphoria compared to many other opiates. <br /><br />i thought about mixing it with some other opiate to add some euphoria to the fentanyl buzz. many people will say just go with another more euphoric opiate but i also enjoy the high/nodding potential of fentanyl a lot. i don&#039;t want to add some oxycontin or anything else everythime i am taking fent, i would like to have a nice mixture/combination which can be ingested at once. do you think thats possible? i know h is often cut with fent but mixing fentanyl with h isn&#039;t that easy because you don&#039;t know the purity of it or which cuttings are in there, if you can&#039;t do a lab test. i think pharmaceutical opiates are the better choice (especially when it comes to dosing). what opiate would you recommend to cut fentany with? i would like to use a nasal spray again because ist&#039;s easier to dose than powder form, so bioavailability should be pretty high and maybe not too long lasting. any other ideas than oxy??<br /><br />has anyone done similar before? can it be done, any advice?<br /><br />regards<br />
