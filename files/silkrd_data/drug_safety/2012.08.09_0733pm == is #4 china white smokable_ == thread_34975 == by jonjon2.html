Having said that, don&#039;t smoke it as it is very wasteful, I believe the heat destroys the active opioids. The best way is to inject, but extremely dangerous for a person with no habit- if you have no habit (and injecting is nearly always a one way road to DVT, amputation, septicemia, gangrene etc- known so many people gone that way or are nearly there, but can&#039;t stop even though they are aware of it!) SNORT IT!

				its not worth it. i always inject and snort my china but sometimes for giggles i mix heroin/caffeine in a 1:1 ratio which makes it smokable. but your way better off snorting or injecting.

				Nothing to add, the answers are correct.<br /><br />18 years ... just be carefully.<br />Once hooked, you will have to hit rock bottom, to go through withdrawal.<br /><br />You know cold turkey?<br />You will be feeling like one , and worse. <br /><br />If you can find a small amount of caffeine and mix it 1 to 1 you will be able to smoke a number four.<br />Smoking from aluminum-foil will prevent you from a overdose.<br />Snort it in little quantity&#039;s and give it some time to get to work.<br /><br />Same as usually heroin, will snorting not give the quick feeling as smoking or injecting does.<br /><br />Be careful (specially with nr 4) and stay healthy.<br /><br />Wasta<br />
