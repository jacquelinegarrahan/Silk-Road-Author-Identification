				Hi all,<br /><br />I took 180mg of Mescaline the other day. I have only micro dosed before, this was the first time at this dose amount. It was a great experience. I took a walk through the woods, the empathy with everything around me was outstanding.<br /><br />Whereas LSD is all about excitement and wonder. Mescaline was all about everything being perfect and right. The woods looked like my own feng shui garden. Touching trees was out of this world, the feeling of connection with them was amazing. Also I had clear logical thinking, without emotion, and was able to think through lots of problems.<br /><br />The only downside was that I developed a bad headache. It started after five hours in and got steadily worse. I do sometimes suffer from migraines, and this felt similar. I don&#039;t know if it was the brightness of the day, or a side effect of the Mescaline. The headache continued all afternoon and I had to spend a lot of time in the shower or trying to sleep. In the end I took a benzo and manged to get a couple of hours sleep and the headache passed.<br /><br />Any one else had similar effect after taking Mescaline? I enjoyed the trip before the headache, but I am cautious to take another larger dose.<br /><br />FH

				I&#039;ve never had that response, and it&#039;s not a common side-effect at all in my experience and understanding. Assuming your Mescaline was clean then I would say this was an anomaly, and not pointing to anything untoward between you and the Mescaline. Sometimes headaches just happen.<br /><br />Of course if there was an issue with the synth or the extraction (which was it?) then there could potentially be a solvent residue of a kind - which could have tweaked you. It&#039;s not likely if your gear is coming from a reliable source, but it&#039;s always a possibility of course. <br /><br />My guess though is that it&#039;s coincidence - although if there is a lot of eye-strain from a very bright day (remember your pupils are wide-open dilated) that could cause some stress in the system for sure, especially if you do have a tendency towards migraines.<br /><br />Perhaps take a slightly smaller doses on less of a bright day, see how it works and then build up your level again...<br /><br />BG

But I won&#039;t mention the vendor, since they have good rep. I think it might be tiredness, dehydration as well. Will try a 130mg dose and see if that causes any issues.<br /><br />Cheeers<br /><br />FH

				Was gammagoblin&#039;s product I&#039;m assuming. I took 250mg of his product along with a friend and it was quite pleasant. I honestly don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever developed a headache in the middle of a trip. Since you have prior history of migraines, I&#039;d say that&#039;s probably the culprit. It might have also been an external factor. I&#039;m hopelessly addicted to caffeine so when I go a day without having something, I get really bad headaches and I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t stop for mescaline.<br /><br />All in all, I doubt it was the mescaline that caused it as I&#039;ve never heard of that being a side effect. Hope this helps!
