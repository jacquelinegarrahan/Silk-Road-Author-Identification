				Hello all,<br /><br />basically everytime my gf does md she just gets real nervous and has tons of trouble with her stomach. Throws up, feels better, sick again, etc. <br /><br />She really just can&#039;t seem to enjoy it, which is a drag because we go to a lot of raves and electro nights, festivals, etc.<br /><br />Am I giving her too much? Was thinking maybe lowering the dose a bit. I give her around 100-120mg and I take 150+ with dabs to keep it rolling. The MD is Subtickle&#039;s in case anyone was wondering, seems clean as hell so I dunno if that&#039;s it.<br /><br />It just seems like every time she takes it she just can&#039;t wait to be off of it. Maybe some supplements to take with it? Tapering dose, different method of delivery, any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers, CW

				Try changing the environment that your rolling in. I alway feel like this on MDMA if im not 100% comfortable in environment.<br />You say you go to raves and clubs, How about trying some where different.<br /><br />I have only whet to clubs a few times on MDMA and while it was good it didn&#039;t think it was great.<br />Personally I like being out in the air looking at the stars when im high. How about trying something similar?<br />Even a low dose and a night in with a few good mates?<br /><br />It&#039;s not the drug you take your how much, It&#039;s where you are the people your with and the generally mood that really gets someone high...<br />

				Is she on any other meds? Anti-depressants or something could hinder the roll possibly. <br /><br />Maybe next time try a pill or M1 for her.<br />

				If I threw up I wouldn&#039;t want to take MDMA either.&nbsp; Especially if she&#039;s skinny I would try 65mg on her.<br /><br />Drugs just aren&#039;t compatible with some people though.&nbsp; I&#039;m borderline myself.&nbsp; Drugs wreck havoc on my digestive system.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time on the toilet after taking most drugs.

				I have no idea how people can handle the MDMA comeup in public.&nbsp; Many people do of course.&nbsp; Maybe the problem is that I&#039;m getting such good stuff off of SR.<br /><br />Regarding methylone....always try a drug by itself the first time.

				This may sound like an odd suggestion (no pun intended),&nbsp; and i promise it is not meant to sound asinine.&nbsp; But have you ever considered if she dislikes MDMA so much to find another drug you both enjoy doing?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know, just if it was me and I realized my girlfriend was repeatedly having a horrible time on a specific drug I&#039;d stop giving it to her.&nbsp; But I&#039;m also a bit old fashioned when it comes to relationships.

MD is very hard on the stomach.<br />Make sure she east a light meal before dropping nothing to heavy. <br />Maybe because she is very anxious when high this could also be causing her to be sick.<br /><br />Have you thought about giving her a small dose and a benzo? Not that im encouraging you to give her more drugs it&#039;s just a thought.<br />Ever time I start to feel overwhelmed and anxious on drugs I take a benzo (Xanax usually) and it clam me right down and lets me enjoy the experience.

				Next time I&#039;m just going to let her try like 50-60mg at our place an hour or two before we leave and see how it settles in, then she can just top up or if it doesn&#039;t fly it won&#039;t ruin the night.<br /><br />The way we tend to do it is definitely not the way someone light of stomach should in hindsight, I&#039;ll try change up the environment. I always just toss back a big bomb like 10 minutes before I go in so I start rolling while I&#039;m in the heat of things, plus saves from moving through security when you&#039;re all trashed, and MD is the first thing they look for in your eyes. Not exactly hard to spot.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t go down smooth next time with a smaller dose earlier on in the night, with a light meal before like someone above said then I&#039;ll just leave it. She&#039;s not keen on hard drugs at all, so the idea of benzo&#039;s, different drugs like coke or whatever definitely won&#039;t go down smooth. MD is very common where we are so it doesn&#039;t have a bad rep, I&#039;m not going to bother explaining that every drug is only as bad as the way it is treated. I&#039;m a lot more open minded about drugs than she is, and honestly if you&#039;re going to try something the worst thing you can do is go in with bad vibes about it.<br /><br />M1 might be alright because it&#039;s so similar to Md but it&#039;s really not for me, might grab a half g for her to try this fall sometime though.

				I agree with your plan to give her a light dose and plenty of time for the come-up.<br /><br />I take a combination of MDMA+MDA now...usually 80mg of each.&nbsp; On the come-up I&#039;m basically in the fetal position.&nbsp; I suppose if I were to go out I&#039;d just use the MDMA.&nbsp; I kind of lost interest in going out since starting drugs though.&nbsp; Driving with huge pupils is beyond stupid, drink prices are high (better to spend the money on more drugs!), the crowds usually want to hear whatever was on the radio 6 months ago, etc.&nbsp; At home I can blast the stereo on the EDM genre&#039;s that I enjoy, I have a nice clean toilet that I need thanks to drugs, a comfortable environment for having lots of sex, etc.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll force myself to go out this weekend.

				Some people are sensitive. 120mg is a lot for some people, try halving to dose for her.
