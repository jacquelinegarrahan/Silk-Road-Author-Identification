				I think it&#039;s Chelated Magnesium that you need, I was looking to try some of this for my next roll

				Any magnesium supplement would work. It just so happens that chelated magnesium absorbs better than magnesium oxide or citrate. You can definitely find all of the information you want on Bluelight. My friends and I normally take 600mg of chelated magnesium and drink some orange juice to get it down. It may not feel the most pleasant in your stomach at first but it will help you from tearing up your gums and teeth while you roll. Just don&#039;t expect to not be moving your jaw after taking it, magnesium definitely isn&#039;t a miracle cure for the bruxism and if there is one out there I&#039;d love to know.

				Has anyone tried Memantine? It&#039;s an NMDA agonist just like magnesium. Maybe this is helpful too?

				Magnesium citrate has a very good absorbtion rate. Especially on an empty stomach, but works either way! Magnesium Glycinate is a good choice for chelated. <br /><br />The brand &quot;Calm&quot; or Natural Calm maybe it is, is a fantastic powdered Mg Citrate that easily dissolves in hot water. Just fill your glass slowly ; ) It is Verrry fizzy!

				Hope this helps. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MDMA induces a release of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus. Glutamate is the body&#039;s primary excitatory neurotransmitter. It binds to NMDA receptor sites, along with glycine, opening the ion channels and allowing calcium to enter the neuron. This is how the brain sends cascading electrical signals. When the ion channels open for too long or too frequently, calcium concentrations can become too high in the neuron. This can lower the effectiveness of your ion channels, or can even cause neuronal death. Magnesium is the substance your body uses to block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner. This means that the ion channel will not allow Ca2+ to pass, even if glutamate and glycine are bound to their receptor sites. However, once the neuronal membrane&#039;s electrical potential rises to an excited state, the Mg molecule will clear the channel and allow for normal operation. Most people are deficient in magnesium as it is. <br /><br />Supplementing a highly bioavailable magnesium supplement will give your body the substance it needs to naturally protect itself from excitotoxicity. There are a number of different types of magnesium supplements. Some are not absorbed very well, other are. The most common form, oxide, is one of the worst. This is where the concept of chelation comes into play. Magnesium is a substance the readily binds to insoluble salts in the stomach and intestines. This makes it hard to absorb. However, if you chelate the magnesium molecule to a soluble amino acid, it prevents it&#039;s binding to insoluble salts, as well as opening up the possibilities for active transport. This means that fully chelated magnesium is absorbed much better by the body. There are a number of different Mg/amino acid combinations. My favorite is magnesium glycinate. This is Mg chelated to a glycine molecule. It can be found cheaply and is highly bioavailable. There is also citrate, L-theonate, oroate, taurate, lysinate, etc. I will let you decide on which one you want to try.<br /><br />Dosage and time schedule: 2,000mg (200mg elemental Mg) 6 hours before, 1 hour before, and during.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
