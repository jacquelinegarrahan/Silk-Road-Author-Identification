				Usually the only time I can take LSD safetly and without unwanted interruption is at nighttime, no earlier than 8pm. Unfortunately, this usually means that I end up getting no sleep at all, and I feel really shitty the next day. It&#039;s even worse if i have work the next afternoon. I was wondering if there was some sort of over the counter pill i could take while coming down from a trip that would help me fall asleep. I usually feel extremely tired, but can&#039;t fall asleep due to my racing mind. Help would be appreciated

				You can generally buy over the counter sleep aids that are just anti-histamines. Depends where you live though. They cause drowsiness but I don&#039;t know how well they work if you&#039;re mind is racing. You can also get herbal natural stuff but that probably works less well than the anti-histamines.<br /><br />I personally always use some diazepam and I always get to sleep within 30 mins. Not exactly over the counter though but people generally wont mind if you have them. You can tell them you have a prescription for your nerves.

				Ambien. Also not exactly over-the-counter, but the shit sure works.

				Ambien may help you get to sleep, but will not help you feel well-rested the next morning.<br /><br />Benzodiazepines will. Valium (diazepam) is the best and easiest to get. Take between 5 and 15 mg. When you wake up, you will feel good.

				Yes, any benzo will do the trick. I always use Xanax as it&#039;s fast acting, strong and has a decent half life. Zolpidem has a very, very short half life so it might not be the perfect benzo for an LSD trip although it is the most interesting benzo I&#039;ve ever tried, very dreamlike so it might just do the trick actually!

				everything that has been said does indeed help. i also recommend eating a few pot edibles, eating a few strong brownies always helps me fall asleep. the other thing that helps me go to sleep is smoking some DMT. i did that this past sunday and it helped me immensely, especially because my spirit was at peace :)

				People have mentioned benzos and ambien, these are among the best bets. I would generalize to GABAergics; benzos, alcohol, z-drugs (of which ambien is one), GBL/HB, others do ya research

				Over the counter sleeping aids are kind of weak to counter the stimulating effects of LSD, that keep you awake, only exception to that are the so called Z-drugs(most common ones are probably Zolpidem( better known as Ambien) and&nbsp; Zopiclone(better known as Lunesta)) They will make you sleep, but from my and friends experiences the probability that you feel like shit when you wake up and lack rest.<br /><br />Most Benzos should work quite well, same with Opiates, Barbiturates would work too but i strongly disadvise taking those, especially not if you just want some sleep.

				Valerian root may be useful if you don&#039;t prefer any benzos. It does help me a bit to fall asleep after amphetamine use. It doesn&#039;t instantly make you fall asleep, but relaxes you so that you can fall asleep.<br /><br />These natural supplements are all generally weaker than benzos, but they help in causing a restful sleep. I have yet to test its full potential myself...

				melatonine works great for me (but most of the time I don&#039;t want to go to sleep after acid - I want to enjoy the &quot;after-buzz&quot; while smoking some hash or having a glas of good whisky). <br />for my GF melatonine doesn&#039;t work and she needs to go to stronger stuff such as &quot;have been listed already&quot;
