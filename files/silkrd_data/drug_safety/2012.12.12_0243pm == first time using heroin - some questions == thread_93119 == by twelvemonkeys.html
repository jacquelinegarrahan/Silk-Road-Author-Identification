				Hey guys, I tried heroin for the first time yesterday and wanted to ask if what I experienced was normal and what could be done to make the next time more pleasurable. I&#039;ll just write what I did and any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />So I bought FrankMatthews #3 and I just tried to do everything as instructed by the many safer-use guides I&#039;ve read. (I have absolutely no experience with opioids or iv-use)<br />I measured about 15mg because I thought I&#039;d better be safe than sorry and starting with a small amount is probably a good idea.<br />Then I added citric acid and heated it but some of it wouldn&#039;t dissolve well so I ended up with the clear, yellow-ish solution and some black clumps, but I think other people have already reported this happening with Franks H.<br />I injected the thing and made sure I was in the vein by pulling the plunger back and checking the blood. It didn&#039;t burn or anything; however, today there&#039;s a hematoma right there and I&#039;m not sure why. Is that normal did I do something wrong?<br /><br />Anyways, now about the experience itself: I immediately felt really tired and warm, sweaty even, got a dry mouth, felt really shaky but there was no real euphoria and no itch. However I did feel very nauseous. And after like 15 Minutes I noticed my heart beating very fast so I checked my pulse and it was 120 which I don&#039;t think is normal either. <br /><br />So my questions are, was my dose simply too low? Why did my heart-rate go up instead of down and why did I feel almost no euphoria? I know everybody might react differently to everything but I&#039;m still a bit confused about what happened. It was not really what I was expecting. And what do H users do about the nausea? I really think it ruins everything. Would antiemetics like Dimenhydrinate (histamine-antagonist) counteract the desired effects of heroin?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if opening a thread for my silly questions is ok, or if this is the right place to discuss these kinds of noob-issues but meh. And sorry for my English.

				first of all did you filter the solution while sucking it up to syringe ? it probably has some nasty cut because no one who wants&nbsp; to inject buys no 3 because citric damages veins overtime everyone buys no 4. no 3 is usually bought by smokers. nausea - if these was your first times it will pass over time. heroin euphoria is a difficult feeling to decribe -&nbsp; it basically means that you&#039;re warm, comfortable and happy. i thought at first i should feel some pleasure from it but 2 years of shooting no pleasure - only pleasure is from when you IV and rush starts. And i did not feel the rush the first few times when i IV&#039;ed. i would advise you to smoke the rest of no 3 you will build up a bit of tolerance to it and buy no 4 to IV. hematoma - is it big ? you probably poked through your vein or used a large needle. I often get them they&#039;re not big however (well i got shaky hands) and i just let that vein heal and use another one and try not to poke through - whenever you see blood come in stop needle and try not to move it draw back if its ok then inject and be still as hard as you can.

				Hey thanks for your quick reply! Yes I did filter it and I bought #3 because I live in Europe and I thought it would be good to get familiar with IVing that one as #3 is more common around here. Weird reasoning, I admit. But you&#039;re right, I&#039;ll definitely get the #4 next time I order. No the hematoma isn&#039;t big and the needle I used was a G29 but I guess I was a bit nervous and my hands were shaky, I&#039;ll just pay more attention next time. <br />Thanks again!

If you just had mild nausea, but you didn&#039;t actually vomit, then yes, it is possible that you could go up a little in the dose.&nbsp; NOT too much, though.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I would definitely filter if possible.&nbsp; Never shot #3 and don&#039;t intend to.&nbsp; From what I know, don&#039;t put excessive amount of CA in.&nbsp; Take all this for what it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; I&#039;m just words on a screen as far as you&#039;re concerned, but I think others will back me up.

				GOT IT FROM A VERY NICE SELLER.. RANKED IN THE TOP 1%<br /><br /><br />so I just had yesterday this bag of i suppose very good #3 heroin.. light brown in powder..<br />I dont use heroin, actually never used before today.<br />I think that me and this friend of mine had some problem doing it cause it didn&#039;t disssolved on the water as i should have been..<br />Well let me tell you how it went..<br /><br />We started putting it in a spoon (I think something like 0.05..half of 0.1... we didn&#039;t had a scale :PP ) then in the spoon 1.5 mg of water .. mixed it up a bit with an electric stove hot. after a while of mixing the water and heroin i putted it near the stove wich was now very hot.. it almost started to boil (my friend had it boiled for some seconds) and there I was, mixing this stuff wich didn&#039;t became a one liquid. SORRY MY ENGLISH) but the H didnt go all in the water.. it wasnt a alltogheter liquid.. actually after heating it on the stove it looked like the water was on the outside of the spoon and the H more in the middle .... anyway i mixed it up a lil bit more.. (Oh yeah the citrus , I putted it after putting the water in the H. 3 drops of some concentrate lemon. ) After mixed it up a bit more i putted a lil filter in it and lifted it all up(from the original 1.5 mil of water there was now 0.9 or something left and alot of brow shit((H)) left in the spoon... is that NORMAL ?? ) and smashed it... <br /><br />I can tell you i&#039;ve used subutex 8 mg for years( not suboxone )IV...but didn&#039;t took any 30 hours before hitting the H. So I obviously have some tollerance for opiates but the heroin was my first time ever.. The first hit didn&#039;t actually said much.. the need of buprenorphine left my body but that was it. I did all this hbulabalula again and it hitted me better than the first one(i putted more H) .. now im just ok .. no need of subutux but I&#039;m sure we did something wrong because the heroin didnät disssolved in the water .. i could still see some sand of h in the water.. they didnt melted in one liquid. <br /><br />After I slammed the first one i got some real bad looking rash like from a plant of nicosia .. they just looked like bubble but i think they were just from the citrus.. some allergic reaction. they lasted for 5-10 min... on the second hit they were lil bit worst. I slammed it i a different place and i think the vein are there smaller so ... <br /><br /><br /><br />WELL IF ANYONE CAN TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO BETTER PLS , IM ALL EAR!! <br /><br />THANKS IN ADVANCE!!<br />WAITING FOR HEEEELP&nbsp; :)
