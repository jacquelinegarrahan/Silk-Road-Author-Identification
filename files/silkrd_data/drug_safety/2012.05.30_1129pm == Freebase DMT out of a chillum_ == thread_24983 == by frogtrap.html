				I know there are tons of threads about smoking DMT already... :/<br /><br />I&#039;ve read up about &quot;the machine&quot;, but I was wondering if it would work just as well to use a short, glass chillum that has a deep bowl. I figure if I just fill the bowl about 3/4s with densely packed chore-boy (that I can still draw through, obviously), I&#039;ll essentially be making a DMT machine, just replacing the airplane-sized liquor bottle with a chillum, right? <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure I get how to melt the DMT into the mesh and then vape it. My understanding is that I should get the chore-boy mildly hot by basically hitting it with no DMT inside, sprinkle my DMT on the copper and make sure it melts (if not, heat from the bottom/sides of the glass until the copper melts the DMT). Once it&#039;s melted, it&#039;s &quot;charged&quot;, and I&#039;m ready to hold the lighter away from the end of the chillum, and begin sucking the hot air from the flame through the copper, trying to make sure I don&#039;t come too close and burn it. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;ll take me a couple of hits to get the hang of how far the flame should be to vape and how hot the metal needs to be to melt the DMT, but I got enough for that not to be too big a deal.<br /><br />I just want to make sure this isn&#039;t a retarded idea for some reason I&#039;m overlooking. DMT is a stranger to me, but not for long, I hope.<br /><br />I want to make sure I&#039;m not going to burn/waste my freebase. Much thanks for any help and apologies for asking a question that I&#039;m sure gets answered a lot around here. I did search the forums for &quot;chillum DMT&quot; and a couple of variations on those terms, but I didn&#039;t come up with anything solid. Thanks again!

				I&#039;m waiting for my DMT to come in the mail and from everything I have read &quot;the machine&quot; is the best way to do it.&nbsp; According to people who have used all sorts of devices, the machine produces the best hits and the least acrid tasting smoke. <br /><br />The chillum will do the trick but may not be the most efficient way.&nbsp; Also, if you are using the chillum for other things, you might get a dose of unexpected dmt as well.<br /><br />For those of you who need instructions on how to make one, here it is:<br /><br />https://mycotopia.net/forums/attachments/botanicals/67822d1195320961-dmt-pipe-83484machine.jpg

				Thanks for your reply, CapnJack. <br /><br />Yeah, I just went and bought a cheap, clear chillum that I&#039;ll be only using for DMT, since I can&#039;t find any small glass bottles of the type they use to make the machine, and I don&#039;t want to shock my unsuspecting pot-head friends with a businessman&#039;s trip. ;) (It&#039;s a terrible joke, I know...)<br /><br />I would essentially have the exact same setup as the picture you referenced (that&#039;s what I was going for)&nbsp; but with perhaps a larger mouth (where the copper will be) and a smaller (in diameter, probably the same volume) chamber where the vapor passes through as I hit it. <br /><br />I suppose I may get a bit more air in my hits, so I can see why the long, skinny-necked bottle would be better. Would that be the only downside to using a chillum this way? I&#039;m not intending to vape directly off of the glass, I&#039;ll be using chore-boy copper mesh. I also don&#039;t intend to hit it like a chillum with weed in it, just slow, constant drawing so the heat from the flame won&#039;t get too close and I won&#039;t pull in too much extra air.<br /><br />

				Hi,<br /><br />My intuition is that it would not work as well. Adding mesh will certainly regulate the temp (more or less) to vaporize the substance, however you won&#039;t have a chamber like a traditional machine. This is pertinent as the chamber not only cools the smoke, but also catches a great deal of material that gets pulled through the mesh. I&#039;ve had the same machine for almost a year - amazing considering I broke half a dozen the year before - and it is completely coated with DMT residue. With a chillum this might end up in your mouth and lungs. How about this: put together a machine with a full sized liquor bottle. A DMT steam-roller of sorts. That could get quite interesting. Ha!

				Thanks so much for the information, guys. I didn&#039;t realize the chamber was so important, but it makes sense. I also thought it had to be one of those tiny bottles. I&#039;ll find something proper then, and once I get a certain package, I&#039;ll have everything I need. :)
