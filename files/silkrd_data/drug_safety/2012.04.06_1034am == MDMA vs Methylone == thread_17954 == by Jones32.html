				I&#039;ve used Methylone and MDMA a number of times and it seems that the general consensus is that MDMA is the better chemical and Methylone doesn&#039;t have the &#039;magic. I honestly don&#039;t see any difference between the two apart from MDMA makeing my eyes wobble, sometimes make me nauseous and is a lot harsher on serotonin levels.<br /><br />What is your preference and why?

				Check out this thread I started a while ago with lots of nice responses:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7231.msg67147#msg67147<br /><br />I never ended up trying Methylone, but I have done MDMA 3 times since.&nbsp; And it was absolutely incredible each time.

If you can&#039;t see the difference then you aren&#039;t getting REAL MDMA at all. I hate it when people say they can&#039;t see the difference because MDMA is such a beautiful thing, Methylone doesn&#039;t even come close IMO.

				I&#039;ve had my fair share of impure Molly and can definitely tell the difference. Ive sampled Jeugen and Ivory&#039;s MDMA along with a bunch of other sellers stuff that test positive for MDMA. I always reagent test my powders before consuming. Maybe it&#039;s just me? I&#039;ll be sampling SKYY&#039;s stuff soon so maybe that will change my perspective.

				Empty stomach and I always stay away from alcohol. I mean, I absolutely love it&#039;s effect but I just can&#039;t really tell the difference between the two, I guess Methylone gets me more pumped up to dance and talk and on Molly I&#039;ll be happy just chilling. Pure MDMA is pretty uncommon in my area so when people see my eyes wobble they freak the fuck out and think I&#039;m having a seizure, I&#039;m on top of the world so I don&#039;t care at the time but it&#039;s kinda annoying when people are constantly coming up freaked out by the eye wobbles.

				I love MDMA but I have concerns about its neurotoxicity. If I could take MDMA every weekend I would. How does methylone compare in terms of neurotoxicity?

				I&#039;ve never gotten the eye wiggles and I&#039;ve taken MDMA multiple times (never any from SR, though) at high doses.<br />Does this mean it&#039;s fake or cut?

It&#039;s the same with bruxism (Jaw clenching) and teeth grinding. There are others like finger twitches and involuntary movements of other parts of the body like licking your teeth and lips. <br /><br />Personally whilst I rarely get bruxism I do get eye wiggles and lick my lips/teeth and finger twitches.
