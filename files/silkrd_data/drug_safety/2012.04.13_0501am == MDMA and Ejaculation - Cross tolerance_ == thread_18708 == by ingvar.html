				&nbsp; Hello I was wondering if one who masturbates frequently (3-6 times a day) would feel less effects from MDMA.&nbsp; My reasoning is that if orgasming is so fun because it releases serotonin then would it not make an MDMA experience weaker if it works by depleting your serotonin?&nbsp; I did E a few weeks ago and my friends said it was the best they&#039;ve ever done, and I felt really good and danced for the second time in my life, but it didn&#039;t feel like I had a constant orgasm times 100 by any stretch.&nbsp; The experience was definitely very great and worth doing many, many more times.&nbsp; But it didn&#039;t feel near as good as some people claim and I am wondering if this is because I masturbate too much.<br /><br />&nbsp;I just realized this is my first post rofl, I&#039;m not trolling or joking though it may be a funny topic.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Damn bro calm down on the wankin&#039;, all that often can&#039;t be healthy. Give it atleast 2 weeks and make a deal with yourself no more tuggin&#039; tommy and your desire to find a girl will increase x100 along with the experience.

				100mg would have been enough if you were 110lbs ... starting dose is 2mg per kg of weight so try 130mg next time.

				The topic title made me LOL.<br /><br />Well from a taoist view it would be&nbsp; &nbsp; more ejaculation=more energy loss=less energy to be released during your high.<br /><br />This COULD be a possible explanation but there is no Cross tolerance between wanking and mdma .

				If you&#039;re asking yourself (or others in this case) if you&#039;re masturbating too much, then you probably are.&nbsp; Honestly, it sounds like you need more interaction with people...or at least a girlfriend!

				There&#039;s no cross tolerance... But wow that&#039;s a lot of wanking! I couldn&#039;t even wank that much in my teens! Also if you take enough MDMA you won&#039;t be doing anything like that for at least a couple of days! I can&#039;t ejaculate for a few days after rolling.<br /><br /><br />Sollemnis

				Yeah, a little less than 100mgs is going to leave you with a &quot;could&#039;ve been better&quot; kind of feeling, unless you&#039;re a very small person.&nbsp; Did your friends all take the same amount as you?&nbsp; If they did, there&#039;s still the possibility that they all hyped each other up and believed it was more amazing than it was.&nbsp; A sort of group-think placebo effect, if you will.<br /><br />A threshold dose for most people is going to be AT LEAST 100mgs, probably more.&nbsp; So that&#039;s your problem.&nbsp; Wank on, man.

				I&#039;m picking up what you&#039;re laying down, OP. <br />Maybe you are so used to the rush of an orgasm, <br />that the rush of MDMA wasn&#039;t particularly special for you.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Now, i love a good fap as much as the next man, but<br />too much fapping makes my orgasms weak, and my<br />desire to find a girl plummet. <br />Moderation is key&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
