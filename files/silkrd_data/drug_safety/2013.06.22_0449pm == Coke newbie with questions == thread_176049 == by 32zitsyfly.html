				Hey all<br /><br />I wanted to ask anyone who has taken it what tips do you have?<br />I have a half gram so how should I take it, so I do a line? Or just a little bit? I know a half gram isn&#039;t much, right?<br />&nbsp;<br />After snorting, besides cleaning our nose, should I drink anything after?<br /><br />Also, should I eat before taking it?<br /><br />Any tips would be appreciated!!<br />Thanks in advance!<br />

				Yes, eat as good meal before you snort, it will do you good and prepare your body for the off chance your appetite gets stunted the next day.<br /><br />Also, depending on what coke you have, you might need to crush it with a bank card and carefully draw into lines.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I would suggest eating before hand if you bought a large binge amount. I usually do the length of my pinky, but thinner. usually good start.

				Oh man! He&#039;s gonna do a .25 inch wide rail now with no point of reference. Thinner than your pinky leaves a lot of room for interpretation. I understand that you were explaining the length-just messing around.

				Thanks for the info<br /><br />What&#039;s a bump? And should I do that before I do a line to &quot;test&quot; it.<br />The quality is I got is some of the best from all of the extensive research I did here before I decided to do this.<br /><br />So: Eat, and don&#039;t snort it up like a vacuum cleaner.<br />Got it!

				after six months I&#039;m ok, more then ok ;D, with 0.1 line (of street, probably shit, cocaine) for like 1 hour and half.<br /><br />it&#039;s your first time, it&#039;s sr coke, hope really good!<br />try 0.05, if you don&#039;t feel the euphoria coming up and numbness, doing another 0.05!<br /><br />don&#039;t binge, don&#039;t do line after line in 10 minutes, cause for me it&#039;s just wasted! you don&#039;t get a new high like the first one, wait like 1 hour, wait the effects start to vanish and BAM! do it again! you feel it again!<br />don&#039;t do too much, it&#039;s not funny to go home lay in your bed and stay awake all night :-\<br /><br />it&#039;s hard, but I love to use it in this way. Find yours :)

				guys i know this is a safety forum but you remember your first line right?&nbsp; that one you chased so hard after.&nbsp; through money, friends, loved ones, priorities *(all of these in some cases)* to get to?&nbsp; but never got back?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />yeah let them experience a nice small line of Sr qual coke.&nbsp; like a little bigger than a bump.&nbsp; ive never had SR quality but ive heard its not what its cracked up to be.&nbsp; i have a good local connection i trust.<br /><br />my point is yes coke is fun, but dont have too much fun, it carries a stigma similar to the scarlet letter with most people.&nbsp; not something you want to be known for.<br /><br /><br />my theory with coke is that everyone has a problem with it, but some just don&#039;t know it yet, until they put a little up there and the fuse is lit
