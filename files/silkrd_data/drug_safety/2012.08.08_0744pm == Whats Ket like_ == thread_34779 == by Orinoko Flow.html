				/index.php?topic=34456.0<br />There&#039;s a little bit about ket in that thread. I know a read another one recently where one of the big names on these forums (can&#039;t for the life of me remember...limitless?) who is a big ket fan talked about it quite a bit. I found it interesting but ket&#039;s not on my list of drugs to try right now. I&#039;d go click around the first three pages of this subforum and see if you cant find it. <br /><br />Good luck

				Ket is like being psychedelically drunk, without the mind-slowing. You know how you lose your peripheral vision when you&#039;re drunk? like that, the visual effects are very similar, however ketamine&#039;s tend&#039;s to be much clearer as your intact non-sedated mind allows you to appreciate the visual effects. You wont be able to walk normally at a lower dose and wont be able to walk at all at a higher dose. <br /><br />50mg up the nose, crush the powder up. Dont bother cooking it - this is just to make it fine powder, you may as well just crush it. I suggest a mirror and a something round flat and metal - i use my grinder and crush it real good against the mirror, you get the finest powder ever.<br /><br />It&#039;s safe as chips, lasts an hour, dont take it on a night out until you&#039;re experienced. I dont think it goes well with E unless you&#039;re chilling in a house, it&#039;s not very anxious at all - until you get toward a k-hole then it is quite scary for a rookie. <br /><br />Have fun, also id personally recommend MXE over ketamine - it&#039;s cheaper, feels better, and lasts longer. Ket = 1 hour, mxe = 6 hours +. Ket is a better before bed though as MXE keeps you awake with it&#039;s dopamine effects.

				Glad I saw this thread, I&#039;ve been looking at the ket listings myself. One of the few drugs I&#039;ve seen here that I have no experience with and no clue what to expect if I try it. Anyway, just in case you don&#039;t already know about it, erowid.org (clear web site) is a pretty awesome resource for information about any drug you&#039;re interested in. Lots of user reports, dosing and safety info, and sections on legality and drug testing. Pretty good stuff.

				Ketamine is pretty strange, I had read quite a bit about it, and had always wanted to try it, but I never actually had an opportunity to until I joined Silk Road. <br /><br />The best thing I can compare it to is being drunk and inhaling some Nitrous Oxide. It&#039;s kind of disorienting though, because usually with NOx, the high/rush only lasts a minute or two, imagine that feeling for a whole hour, coupled with the vague sensation of being drunk, and you&#039;ve basically got Ketamine. <br /><br />Even after all of the reading that I did leading up to it, I still felt kind of overwhelmed during my first time. For your first time, I&#039;d recommend doing it with a sober friend, or at least have someone that you can call and talk to if things start to get too intense. <br /><br />Overall though, I think you&#039;ll like it, it&#039;s an interesting and enjoyable experience once you know what to expect.

MXE is better in lower doses; you dont want to go overboard with MXE as a 6 hour M-hole is intense, it&#039;s better to take 30mg of MXE and that&#039;s you sorted, redosing when it wears off. <br />The amount of times ive thought &quot;aw shit this is so fuckin&#039; good, lets have another line or two&quot; and ended up being unable to understand conversation whilst being unable to communicate properly myself makes me say this.<br /><br />K however from what ive read and felt is better around the k-hole dose; 70mg+ <br />K is more of a clean psychedelic; pure NMDA-antagonistic dissociation, MXE is both this and also has dopamine activity, making it more directly euphoric and giving it a different feel. <br />In a lot of ways you could say MXE is like low dose Amphetamine or Cocaine; it makes you chatty and lighthearted, whilst the dissociation adds to the fun.<br />K is all about the dissociation, i dont think it&#039;s as great for chilling with pals and it makes people weird.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, MXE is real weird too at higher doses but at a good level it&#039;s euphoric bliss. Its my favourite chill out drug, it makes you just appreciate how good everything all is, far better than pot as it gives no anxiety, because on MXE because you simply cannot grasp the concept of fear ;)

				Rhino ket is this dumb-ass name for MXE/Methoxetamine, i assume the name comes from the fact MXE lasts longer than Ket and so joe public just stepped up the associated animal to correlate to the longer half-life, is the latter is known for its use as a horse anaesthetic

				I ordered 100mg of etizolam&#039;s s-isomer ketamine. It will be my first time trying it. Whats the chances it is S-isomer?

				Ket is lovely mate, it is such a shame I have to get it on the street in the UK due to enormous prices on silkroad. Who the heck puts up ket for this much? Ket is £15-20 a gram on the street. <br /><br />I never mix it with anything, and I love to k-hole so a high dosage is for me. I usually take it before sleep or whenever my yard is free. It is the unsociable way of taking it, but man... 350-500mg in two lines will put you in a deep hole, I put my headphones on chill on my bed when it is very dark. And just let yourself fall... if you relax enough you will not be scared of falling, give it a practice and you will thank me later, it sometimes feels like you are falling out of bed, don&#039;t let it distract you. Travel through that tunnel listening to your fav music, let yourself go on that rollercoaster and come back to reality when you are done. Buying some ket this weekend... good luck :)

				K is very nice. I&#039;m no expert, but I&#039;ve done my research and experiments. It&#039;s safe, and has little to no hangover or insomnia. So it&#039;s a bit easy to repeat.<br /><br />When you&#039;re falling into the K hole, i.e. leaving your body, you really want to be able to just relax and drift off. Don&#039;t fight it, go deeper, waaaay deeeper..... Listen to music, float around in what appears to be another dimension, you can open your mind&#039;s eye, and really look around in what appears to be your new reality. It looks so real. Music sounds pretty weird in a good way. You&#039;re so immersed in this new world, enjoy it, take your time. Eventually you question the nature of reality. Unfortunately, you gradually drift back to your body, and it&#039;s a bit of a downer. You are not a supernatural being, you are some dude on drugs, again :-) At the same time, it&#039;s still nice to come back &quot;home&quot;. A bit like a really good holiday.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s best with headphones on loud, music is cool. I like nice trippy psy-trance, bass heavy, repetitive, progressive house. I overlaid this with some chakra meditation self-hypnosis audio mp3 which has some cool &quot;ommmmmm ommmmmmm&quot; sounds like monks make, and talk about inner peace and stuff. Very, hmm, interesting! The hypnosis guy is Glenn Harrold.<br /><br />You need to be careful where you take it. You really can leave your body for 45 minutes to an hour. Be sure to leave it somewhere safe where it won&#039;t fall over and hurt itself, or get mugged. If you are in a club or at a festival or something, and you&#039;ve had too much, you might find yourself stumbling around, lost, not sure where you were even trying to go in the first place. Losing grip on reality. Strange patterns appear everywhere, with eyes open, but more often in the dark. Kinda cool, but can be a bit messy. Especially if your friends don&#039;t know you&#039;re on K, and think you&#039;re passing out.<br /><br />Can anyone comment on the k-hole visuals, other worlds? I find they aren&#039;t always very spectacular, and sometimes wish I&#039;d see a bigger, more infinite, and bright world, but sometimes it&#039;s a bit familiar. Are they more impressive or intense with a higher dose? Or is a full blown k-hole similar to the next, with just longer duration in bigger doses?

It was not scary at all....I&#039;ve had those moments where reality just checks out on you...and a bit of anxiety creeps in...not this...Nitrous+LSD catapulted me into an awesome peak and a group of 5 friends went to the beach to play with sand, listen to the water getting sucked back into the ocean, draining through the grains....watching the world turn as the full moon set over the ocean right beside a group of storm clouds with the occasional flash of lightning. By far my best trip ever....the acid was great, but I really think the nitrous, while short duration added some &quot;good vibes&quot; and that just stuck with the trip.

				With all this K talk I did my first Ket yesterday afternoon. I ordered some from our man Ivory a while back when the last big mega-ket thread was going but never got around to trying it. This thread made me want to again.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Took 50mg in a relaxed setting, with some nice music and a comfortable spot to just lie down. I did only 50mg since it was recommended here as a safe start dose and I didn&#039;t want to K-hole or anything straight up - just get a feel for the drug.<br /><br />It was quite interesting and on the whole enjoyable. A lot of people&#039;s description on here seemed quite accurate. Kind of like being drunk but with clear thoughts. Also very floaty and fun state.<br /><br />I ultimately want to K-hole, so will up my dose next time to 70mg. And slowly up it in 10mg increments from there.<br /><br />The really nice thing was that 90 mins after I dosed I was absolutely back on baseline with no side-effects. It&#039;s like you haven&#039;t done anything. No comedown, no hangover, no nothing. Nice. :-)<br /><br />DW

I don&#039;t know how people do it at parties though at high doses, I have to be either sitting or laying when I do it.

				I can remember my last time doing K, felt like a spaceman. Took about 30 minutes to walk up a flight of stairs with a mate pretending we were taking giant leaps for mankind......good times.

				I&#039;m gonna try K (s-isomer from Mitanox just before he left, I got lucky) for the first time.<br /><br />What would you guys recomend the best ROA is?&nbsp; Insufflation or bombing/parachuting? <br /><br />I&#039;ll be doing it alone, inside in a very relaxed and safe environment (WITH MUSIC ! heh), what would be a good starting dose for insufflating (30mg? more?) or parachuting (50mg ?? no clue).&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to hole, I just want to get a feel for the drug.<br /><br />Thanks, time to get fucked up

				30mg insufflated is perfect for a beginner.&nbsp; if you want you can do another bump after 45 min to an hour
