				IMO smoking is the best way to use it, snort hurt as fuck! for like 30 seconds<br /><br />don&#039;t know how to get a &quot;euphoric experience&quot; but for a first timer I think .15mg (not .1g) it&#039;s enough to stay awake hours. Wait after you use it, cause sometimes, for a first timer, seems it not works or at least not as you expect, and that&#039;s how you don&#039;t sleep in the night lol.<br /><br />don&#039;t snort .1g like cocaine, it will fuck you up for days.

				Erowid is your friend.<br />I&#039;d suggest injesting it, I&#039;ve heard snorting meth is rather uncomfortable, especially for 0.1g.<br /><br />If you snort it may last 2-4 hours. Injesting may last 3-5 hours.

				I am very inexperienced with meth- very uncommon in UK, apart from in the gay scene, I believe. I&#039;ve got it from SR about 4 times now and have always got just 0.1 or 0.15g at the most. I have always smoked it in a bubble pipe, and have found 0.1g to be sufficient to keep me up all night (after starting it at about 11.30 am.) and still be buzzing the next day. When I had the 0.15g, I shared it with someone else, even then, I found I smoked too much a couple of times and got an overdose head-ache! I have heard you get more euphoria when you snort it, I don&#039;t know the truth of this as there appears to be a lot of conflicting thoughts/theories about meth and it&#039;s usage. There is a rather good thread somewhere in Drug Safety about the safest way to use it and avoiding neuro-damage etc.

This is a functional drug, which means that it will enhance and amplify your current ability set. You will run faster, think quicker, fuck like a pornstar, and not give a fuck about anything besides the current task at hand. That&#039;s what amphetamines are best for. If used to achieve a euphoric high, amphetamines just fuck you in the ass, dry you out, and leave you on the side of the road to die. They are to be respected.

				If you&#039;re not used to the stuff and depending how good it is, I think .1 would be good. Yeah, if you want euphoric then just get some MDMA. Like the man before me posted, amps aren&#039;t to be taken lightly. Be careful and know your limits. Same with any other drug. <br />As far as smoking vs snorting; really depends. A lot of people say smoking it gets you higher than snorting it, &amp; it&#039;s true to an extent. I have personally found that you go through your product quicker when smoking. I could make it last a while if I was snorting. Little lines or a couple bumps &amp; I could conserve it pretty well. It&#039;s going to burn like you got the clap up your nose, but that goes away after about 30-45 seconds. If you are going to snort it, than the number one piece of advice I can give to you is to make sure you chop the bitch up fine! Go through it several times with a blade and make sure you can get it as thin as possible. Those shards will fuck your nose up &amp; you&#039;ll be bleeding if you don&#039;t chop it up. Just remember to be safe
