				I know this is a sensitive subject, most people look down upon cutting drugs.<br /><br />I understand that, I don&#039;t like when people take a very unpure drug and cut it up and make it even shittier..<br /><br /><br />That being said, I think it&#039;s different here on the silk road... there are pure/almost puredrugs here whereas most kids cut all ready shitty drugs to make an extra buck.<br /><br />In the same sense that&#039;s what I&#039;m doing.. but the dope and c from vendors here is not the run of the mill average stuff you buy on the streets and for the purpose of resale.. absolutely must be cut for the purpose of keeping customers safe from overdosing and keeping them happy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done some research and found that common vitamin B12, inositol, and talc are common cutting agents... but in what proportions? I wish somebody sold a cutting formula...<br />

				Are you fucking kidding me? No shit people look down upon cutting drugs, it&#039;s lying to your customers and can be incredibly dangerous. It&#039;s nothing but disregard for other people and a whole ton of greed.<br /><br />Nobody &quot;needs&quot; their product cut to keep them safe. Are you seriously trying to hide behind that as a reason? And cutting products doesn&#039;t &quot;keep them happy&quot;, no customer will say that they want LESS pure product.<br /><br />Fuck off and die and take your shitty coke with you.

HOWEVER you lost me when you saw that you were going to cut cocaine with talcum powder....then I just thought you were a Grade A douchebag. <br /><br />

Nobody I know will pay $255 for a gram of heroin no matter how pure it is... I don&#039;t even know any street dealers who sell pure bags, they cut that shit. Even the shit on SR that is claimed to be pure is cut... I don&#039;t lie to custy&#039;s either, you think that they don&#039;t know there product isn&#039;t pure? How many stamp bags do you know of that are processed straight off the key? None...<br /><br />It&#039;s not as if I&#039;m claiming to have pure shit while I cut... thats lying. You&#039;re an idiot if you think business like this is run where they don&#039;t cut product. If you were a dealer and got a key of h to sell you would&#039;nt cut it? Thats just fucking stupid.. And tell me how do almost all unintentional overdoses occur? exactly.<br /><br />I&#039;m not here to argue, just seeking a professional and safe way to cut.

				I sort of see what you are saying here but mate, don&#039;t use talcum powder as a cut. Ever lol. That&#039;s just plain common sense really. I am sure you have used talcum powder to put round your balls when you have been the gym right? Well imagine sniffing that or worse shooting it through your veins, it&#039;s gunna clog your pipes faster than a shit that wont flush because it don&#039;t really dissolve that well. Also if you are sniffing blow you don&#039;t want to have talc sniffles do you? <br /><br />

				Waytoomany, a word of wisdom from myself, unsolicited of course. <br /><br /><br />I view Silk Road as a personal enterprise. The means by which I obtain high quality/purity drugs relatively safely and hands free.<br />&nbsp;To view it as a business enterprise means you would sell to people on here, because it is safe. To sell IRL after you have seen people on here doing the same volume of business ( and taxing a bit more, understandably) is stupid. Silk Road is the perfect venue for those of us who satiate certain urges with out the usual rigarmarole of copping.<br /><br />end these thoughts buddy, work a few more hours, and don&#039;t sell drugs in your hometown, EVER!!!!!<br />

				I actually have experience and witnessed people cutting both coke and heroin.<br /><br />The best coke cuts are inert and don&#039;t really add anything, or taste like too much. If you got an ounce of super good coke put a quarter of creating mix it up super good and then get some ether and rerock that shit back up. I had a buddy that used powdered BeniFiber, and honestly it was great, doesn&#039;t burn and you get your daily fiber.<br /><br />For heroin vitamin B12 or sleep aid pills or there are these allergy medicine (forget the drug name) and they are capsules with white powder and work well with heroin, because you can shoot it and be fine, it helps take away the itch, and potentiates the nod.<br /><br />I am no was condoning your actions, but better you have good advice then ruin your product and someones nose.

				I got introduced to SR from a friend of mine, IRL. <br /><br />One day, he told me he got some H in and I came to get some. Turns out it was fucking coffee creamer, and I didnt figure that out until after I iv&#039;d it. I fucking shot up coffee creamer because I trusted this piece of shit. <br /><br />Fucking coffee creamer!!!<br /><br />Dont cut, your fucking with peoples health. Ill probably have to have my heart valves replaced soon because of this prick.

Found that out because I couldn&#039;t believe that parecetamol would actually run, so did my own little experiment.<br />P.S How did you find your coffee creamer hit- you should have added a bit of caffeine and a packet of digestive biscuits! LOL<br />I once injected some gravy granules! The worst thing is, that I half knew in my mind it wasn&#039;t H, but at that time my addiction was pretty damned desperate, and being in withdrawls I jacked it anyway just hoping it had a bit of H in it- the way the guy acted as he sold it was a bit off , then later I heard that he&#039;d been ripped off with 1oz of gravy granules! (and so sold it as fast as he could before word got round!)<br />BUT it just shows how desperate people can be and the dodgy things they will do to themselves when in the madness of addiction and withdrawl !<br />Thankfully, I have come through the other side and can enjoy high quality drugs in moderation thanks to Silkroad!<br />There is a very valid argument for cutting&nbsp; the H with something safe before letting an injector use it, I was going to let a pal have some of the strong H off here (when it appears again!), but there&#039;s no way I could&nbsp; just give it them and leave them to it- at the moment, UK H is about 5% if you are lucky- it would just kill him!
