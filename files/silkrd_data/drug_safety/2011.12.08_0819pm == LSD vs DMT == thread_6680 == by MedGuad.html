				Hi I have a quick question regarding LSD vs DMT.&nbsp; I have recently done some very good LSD and had a great time.&nbsp; There toward the end of the trip though was a bit rough but after smoking some AK47 trees I was soundly sleeping approximately 12 hours after dropping (ended up doing about 240ug according to seller).&nbsp; Felt pretty good the next day.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve NEVER done DMT but am very anxious to try to it.&nbsp; My question is how similar are the two (if at all).&nbsp; Is it easier to come down from?&nbsp; Are the hallucinations pretty overwhelming?&nbsp; How long does it last?&nbsp; Does it affect you emotionally afterwards?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions. I&#039;m going to start researching it, but I wanted to talk to the experts :)&nbsp; &nbsp;DMT will definitely be my next purchase on here.<br /><br />Thank you all!

				Depends on your method of use.<br /><br />For smoking DMT the onset is about a minute, the whole thing lasts about 15-20 minutes with some after-effects lasting about 30-40minutes.<br /><br />If you &#039;break through&#039; with DMT it can be, at least from my experience, quite profound and emotional. But mostly it&#039;s just batshit insane hallucination. It kind of depends on how you can control the trip. It takes some experience.

				Haven&#039;t tried DMT myself, am looking forward to doing it myself as well...<br />And for what I&#039;ve learned about it is that... Really no drugs can be compared... <br />DMT has much shorter but much more intense effects (again, no personal experience) then does LSD. DMT&#039;s plateau&nbsp; effects take like 5-15 minutes, and all effects are gone in about an hour or so.<br />I often read stuff about people passing out, only to find their consciousness is being blasted to another dimension, which the person before me described as breaking through.<br />Come down is lot easier with DMT I think, although it can be difficult to integrate the whole experience. DMT itself is broken down very quickly by MAO, which is the main reason you smoke it, and can&#039;t eat (unless combined with MAOI&#039;s, but that stuff is risky for as far as I know).<br />So, while they are both psychedelics, they are very different substances indeed! But again, no personal experience with DMT yet...

				Some people have a hard time actually dosing with DMT via smoking, and the &#039;breakthrough&#039; I&#039;m talking about is this difficulty.<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked&nbsp; DMT dozen times or so, and I didn&#039;t really &#039;breakthrough&#039; and have it hit me real hard until my second or third dose.<br /><br />The oral route with an MAOI [need this or it does nothing--MAOI can cause great bodyload] provided more consistent results for me--but it really depends on your weight. I was at about 200lbs and 50-60mg was a strong dose.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Before you smoke it try googling &quot;dmt machine&quot; and find instructions for making The Machine dmt pipe out of a hennesey bottle. Looks like a winner and I think I would try it that way for maximum smoking results.

				i just tried N,N-DMT last night for the first time and found the effects very overwhelming and strange, the open eye visuals were incredible never seen any thing that beautiful (kaleidoscope/tapestry effect) on acid, Also i think you cant really compare smoking dmt to dropping acid, maybe if i had eaten the DMT with an MAOI so the method of administration was the same you could compare the two. i think the real magic will come when smoking DMT while on LSD! lol

				I can say I have done many many UG&#039;s of LSD at one time. Ive also smoked a lot of DMT <br /><br />DMT is a quick high, Very quick! almost before you exhale. You will be propelled &quot;out there&quot; or &quot;breakthrough&quot; The only thing with DMT is it only last a few minutes. If its extracted with or mixed with a MAOI then it will last a little longer. That can be a good thing or bad thing depending on the person and how much was smoked :) <br /><br />LSD is a lengthy and it comes in &quot;waves&quot;&nbsp; But you already know that.<br /><br />I would say DMT is worth trying at least once before you die. It can be much different then LSD depending on how much is ingested.<br /><br />Of course you can also do both together. I have done this a few times... Its going to put you WAY OUT THERE! for about 15 minutes. you cant get any higher unless you strap a rocket to your back! believe that.<br /><br />Personally, the older I get, the less I crave or have a desire to do such extreme &quot;phycos&quot; .<br /><br />But its worth doing at least once :)

				I like DMT a lot, but only done it a handful of times I just remember it had a nice smooth sweet but rubbery taste that was the best bit. My trip was short and flirted on the edges of very intense - but haven&#039;t tried the stuff that&#039;s offered here. Pretty keen to do so might tip me to the next level.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t like the LSD come down paranoia - ive done it a lot like a lot a lot.&nbsp; Now matter how experienced you are or how good it is all it take is your mind to catch onto one paranoid thread of thought (pretty easy after 8 of not sleeping and jumping around) and its where the hell did i put the Valium geez will this end please ! - thats the only bad thing about it but its a big a pretty big minus.... and the paranoia seems to me to become trapped in your sub-conscious can be for days even weeks afterwards - like a psychotic break but i&#039;m not into Psychiatric mumbo jumbo applied to LSD problems (which does more harm then good in a lot of cases) - Its more that you&#039;ve caught spiritual flu, from the trip.

				Thank you all for the advice.&nbsp; Like most of you, I didn&#039;t like the long come down from LSD.&nbsp; I enjoyed the experience, until around the end.<br /><br />DMT sounds exactly what I would love to try.&nbsp; How exactly do you take it?&nbsp; I usually smoke trees and have some pipes and a MFLB for vaporizing trees.&nbsp; Will I be able to just sprinkle it on to it?<br /><br />Thanks again!

				Have done acid a couple of times and I just tried DMT. <br /><br />I think there different animals. Dmt had more of what I describe as a winning feeling while acid is like going back into childhood.<br /><br />If i had to pick one or the other it would probably be dmt because I&#039;d have the time to enjoy it more often.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Emotionally, in the 30-60 seconds totally coming down from the dimitri, you will feel absolutely blown away, and lost for words, filled with the most profoundly strong energy, feeling reborn, feeling no negativity towards a thing in the world (unless your experience is unpleasant) (everyone has their preferred dosage, and finding that can put you right where you want to be usually). <br /><br />I personally have a ritual.<br />-Build a nest out of pillows and blankets<br />-Adjust the lights to a nice dim level (I have christmas lights in my room , and they set me in a very comfortable mindstate.:)<br />-Put on some pleasant, relaxing or psychedelic music<br />-Sit in my nest, and rip the steamroller.. (my piece of choice)<br />-Lay back and drift into the realm of infinite transcendence and possibility.
