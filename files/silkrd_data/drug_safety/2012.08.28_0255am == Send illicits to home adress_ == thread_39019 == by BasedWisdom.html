				I&#039;m relatively new and have not made purchases as of yet via SR. I think the community here is a real thing of beauty. So what do you think? Home address or undisclosed location? Thankyou alll! 8)

				Sending to home has the best chance to get delivered. Use your real name, and try to keep orders small. Don&#039;t order a HP to your home

				Yeah, if your intent is small orders you should be fine. Plenty of people on here advise more cautionary routes but I do not believe it is necessary for low volume product. This is especially true when buying from the SR pros who know how to send a package properly to get it sent. Just get it sent like you would a normal package and the postal service will think it a normal package.<br /><br />Cheers

				I am much happier sending things to my home address than risking a work address or having to sign up for a PO box and provide ID. <br />The sensible thing, as others have said, is to keep the orders small and to read feedback from other buyers regarding packaging. I personally use different names for each vendor with my home address, because we get a lot of junk mail here from previous tenants anyway I just feel more comfortable with that than using my own name.<br /><br />Another thing is to read up on which countries are an auto-flag for your customs - I know that where I am from anything being sent from India usually gets seized as a lot of online pharmacies operate from there and send to here.<br />Good luck :)
