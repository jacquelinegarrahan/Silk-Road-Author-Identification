				i was thinking of starting a list of drugs that wont show up in standard drug screening procedures, but the more i looked into it, evidence seems to show that almost every drug can be tested for and it basically comes down to the laboratory&#039;s ability to test for particular substances.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;d like to create a list of drugs that aren&#039;t detectable, but i&#039;m not sure if any exist.&nbsp;

				Agreed with the person above me. LSD and shrooms can both be tested for, but only within something like 12-24 hours after taking them, and they have to be specifically tested for. The normal urine test that you would get at say, probation or work would not even test for those two, making them a really safe drug to do(and super fun!). I can attest to this personally, as I have been urine tested 2 days after taking LSD and I passed :).

				LSD, Polysyllabic Mushrooms, and Salvia (after ~24 hours: saliva test ONLY) are undetectable via hair follicle and urine testing, probation, home, and most lab kits cannot and will not (due to inability) test for these.

				Opiates only take like 3 days to get out of your system if you aren&#039;t a heavy user.

				EVERY DRUG can be tested for.&nbsp; Whether or not you are in a situation where they are testing for the specific drug is the question.&nbsp; Remember tests cost money... who the fuck is gonna pay for your 1000$+ lsd test unless you were suspected of lsd use in a car accident?&nbsp; I&#039;ll tells yah, nobody.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				RCs are almost never tested for. The only RC that is sometimes tested for is the most popular JWHs and even then JWH is only water soluble. <br /><br />You are safe with psychedelic RCs such as 2c-b, AMT, 4-ACO, 25I, 5-meo-dmt, Foxy, etc. <br /><br />N,N,DMT is also not tested for.
