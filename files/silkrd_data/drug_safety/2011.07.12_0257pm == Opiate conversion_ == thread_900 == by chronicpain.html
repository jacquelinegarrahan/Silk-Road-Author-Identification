				Here is the greatest opiate conversion that I know is out there. It&#039;s kind of funny, I told my doc about this and he now uses it regularly in his practice.<br /><br />http://www.globalrph.com/narcoticonv.htm<br /><br />Just so you know PO means by mouth.

				Very good info.&nbsp; I saw something like this a few years back but the only thing I remembered was that hydrocodone was 90% as effective as oxycodone.<br /><br />The good thing now is(well good that this chart is available bad everywhere else) , recently the DEA has come down hard on pain patients in Florida.&nbsp; &nbsp;This could be law or unofficial policy (DEA is very good at that here), but supposedly the limit on one of my medications got reduced 25% and that is the limit.&nbsp; My doctor told me this is because it&#039;s an IR med and he can replace whatever is missing (next month of coarse, fking bastard) with a long lasting med just let him know what to write.<br /><br />This chart will be exactly what I need when I go back in a few weeks.<br /><br />No just need to figure out what to convert to :)<br /><br />

				Wow, I really hope this is correct and that I did it right.<br /><br />Was wondering what #60 30MG Oxycodone IR(1800mg) would be&nbsp; &nbsp;and it told me it&#039;s the same as 900mg of dilaudid?!&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s insane if it&#039;s true.&nbsp; Means someone can get 225 K4&#039;s instead(4mgx225=900mg) of 60 roxies?<br /><br />Is this correct? It also told me it&#039;s only 135mg of methadone, so 60 30&#039;s is to 13 and a half 10mg methadones?&nbsp; Yeah uh fuck that.<br /><br />Do you know of any other charts to check?&nbsp;

				you have to remember that oxycodone (when taken orally) has a bioavailability of about 80 percent. Oxymorphone is 10 percent. I think dilaudid is in that range as well. but if you check it iv, then the numbers are totally different. dilaudid is 100 percent&nbsp; iv. <br /><br />ITs all how you calculate it by method of ingestion, oxycodone, hydrocodone all have very high oral rates. Morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, have very low oral rates but their iv rates are 100 percent.<br /><br />When I did my calculations. If I did 4 30mg of oxycodone a day if I where to go to dilaudid I would have to take 82mg&#039;s. so orally, 120mg of oxycodone is equal to 45mg of dilaudid a day.<br /><br />Also, you may need to check if it by mouth, iv or whatever.<br /><br />And remember, some docs will calculate a cross tolerance. its used to prevent od&#039;s. So, they will usually&nbsp; drop the equivalent by 25 percent and then move you up.<br /><br />Does that make sense?

				Chronicpain is right.&nbsp; I just never got the cross-tolerance issue quite right in my head.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s the charts I use.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t check Clay&#039;s calculations, but I know these three are right:<br /><br />opiate bioavailability by ingestion route: http://taimapedia.org/index.php?title=Opiate_bioavailability<br /><br />opiate dosage equivalents: http://www.medcalc.com/narcotics.html<br /><br />opiate potentiation methods: http://opioids.com/opiates/index.html<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the globalrph equivalency chart because you have to *correctly* gauge your cross-tolerance, which is nigh to impossible, for me.<br /><br />the medcalc one simply tells you how much and also, kind of nice, the efficacy duration.&nbsp; Which is really good for people unfamiliar with <br />stronger opiates.&nbsp; The easiest way to die is to just want to &quot;top off&quot; and mistakenly depress your CNS into submission.&nbsp; Especially with fentanyl.<br /><br />Hope this helps...

				heroine breaks down into morphine. oxycodone breaks down into oxymorphone. Hydrocodone breaks down into hyrdomorphone. Im not sure what methadone and Fentanyl break down to since they are synthetic. I believe codeine stays the same, codeine (not 100 percent sure on that one)

				Wow, that&#039;s what I get for posting when I&#039;m almost asleep and opiated.&nbsp; I meant to say &quot;morphones/morphine&quot; and now I posted completely inaccurate info.&nbsp; I was being lazy, trying to keep it simple and avoid the details. :P&nbsp; Here&#039;s the full scoop:<br /><br />All of them except morphine have to break down to cross the blood/brain barrier and get absorbed.&nbsp; The full breakdown is:<br /><br />codeine, heroin, fentanyl = morphine<br />dilaudid, palladone = hydromorphone<br />oxycontin, roxicodone, percocet = oxycodone<br /><br />They all bind to the brain&#039;s receptors (more or less) equally well; but the hydromorphs are lousy for oral ingestion due to low oral bioavailability.&nbsp; A regular opiate user will be very disappointed if they eat dilaudid or palladone.&nbsp; I know, I was.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, fentanyl is 100X stronger than morphine so people have to mind the doses are in mcg not mg.&nbsp; Particularly when there&#039;s no filler, like when railing with the patches.<br /><br />vicodin, norco, lortab=hydrocodone&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hydro is made from codeine or thebaine, another natural poppy narcotic, so it breaks down to morphine too.&nbsp; Hydro binds to the brain&#039;s receptors at about a 60% efficacy of the others which is why street value is usually &quot;2mg hydro=1mg oxy&quot; for simple conversion.&nbsp; When you make poppy tea the effect comes from codeine and thebaine too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides the above, the high is determined by ingestion method and bioavailability.&nbsp; Anyone wanting to educate themselves should really check out the opiophile.org page.&nbsp; It was the old heads over there that educated me and also pointed me to good resource materials.&nbsp; Advice threads are a great start, but it&#039;s always best to find out for yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks @Chronicpain for posting.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to leave bad info up on a thread. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				High dose?&nbsp; Depends on the patient I guess.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I did it wrong, I put in 1800mg of oxycodone (60 30mg pills, the amount i got scaled back because of the limit) and it said 900, I probably did it wrong because my eyes lit up as it said I would get 225 of the 4&#039;s instead.

				Just a little insight;<br />all that calculations are for responses in pain.<br />Just if some opiate is stronger that does not mean that buzz is stronger or euphoria. Opiates are analgetic and those charts are for pain response comparation.

				The Narcotic conversion is there to help the doctor not overdose/under dose the patient. Yea, you are right, the conversion tables are for analgesic equivalence, not high equivalence, lol.&nbsp; Also, it gives the recreational user a guideline to help him/her not OD. I use it on a regular basis. They even have it for the ipod, etc. but that&#039;s when it starts costing money...

				Yeah guys know your conversions but also know your opiates...dilaudid will give you a rush with a needle but 30 mg oxy will get you higher longer. Just know what you want in your recreational use when selecting your opiate then go to a conversion chart. :D<br />

				If you opiate naive, opana can be a very dangerous road. I would get a milligram scale, weigh the whole pill and then crush it up and take 2 or 3mg and then wait a bit, then repeat.

				start with 1/8th of the pill. be safe. 5mg nasal is like 2mg iv which is a good starting dose. (it should be plenty) it may be you need more because the pill is geling in your nose and not fully absorbing but play it safe.&nbsp;

				How to become an IV Junky in Four Easy Steps:<br /><br />Level 1: Snort your heroin (cook up in a spoon, pull into a syringe, take needle off and squirt into nose).<br />Level 2: Upgrade to shooting a spike (needle) into your ass cheek. This high only lasts a few times, don&#039;t worry<br />Level 3: Increase your now (if not daily need) semi-regular habit to shooting into your asshole, or skin (IM).<br />Level 4: Now that you&#039;re tired of not getting as high as level 1, 2, and 3, complete your upgrade by IV&#039;ing into your bloodstream. Your junky&nbsp; buddy will probably have to do it for you the first few times. But, seriously, who cares about abscesses, skin lesions, growing bacteria, or the fact that eventually you&#039;ll pawn all your shit for this wonder drug (which will make you look like death warmed over, and your clothes fall off?) <br /><br />Congratulations, you&#039;ve successfully completed all your levels!

Will give you same effect, will last longer and as long as you don&#039;t pop one every hour, you won&#039;t puke. But remember, young grasshopper, these &quot;zen&quot; feelings will require more and more ingestion and use of said opiates. Tolerance is a byyyyyatch!<br /><br />

				agree with ready rock. if you have absolutely no tolerance, wait til you have an empty stomach and take half the pill. it will take a max 10 minutes to hit you and you will feel all of it. wait an hour and if you want to get higher/think you can handle it take the other half...wait for snorting a couple months down the line when eating doesnt get you high anymore, otherwise it&#039;s not worth the all the nastiness and feeling like a junky waaay before you have to<br /><br />and to the guy that was gonna eat a whole opana, jesus christ man. if you had no tolerance you&#039;re lucky you didn&#039;t OD on 10 mg snorted. Opana has fucked me up more than any other snorted opiate ever, including heroin, and thats with a respectable tolerance going. A line from a 40mg opana has got to be like 10 x as strong a line of heroin. you&#039;re lucky the only thing that happened to you was throwing up. opana will fuck your shit UP.<br /><br />whenever i know i&#039;ve done enough opiate to be feeling zen but all i&#039;m feeling is fucked up and on edge, i take a little bit of a benzo to calm me down a little. usually, this results in zen within half an hour.

				many years ago my grilfriend and i were slaves to the opiate. slamming heroin to be precise. the only good thing about street heroin is it&#039;s dirty, so when it&#039;s time you&#039;ve had enough, the kick is PAINFUL but relatively short (a month or so, psyically... years more psychologically).<br /><br />prescription opiates are pure, and from what i&#039;v hear MUCH more difficult to kick. (esp methadone).<br /><br />to whomever is listening to my rant, here, and is hooked on opiates, here is what i would do different now.<br /><br />1) never touch the shit to begin with. (anyway the high is only good when you&#039;re sick. before then it just makes you naseaous)<br /><br />2) to end an opiate addiction today i would first switch to kratom. it&#039;s natural, it&#039;s mild and it&#039;s kind of legal. then kick everything after a few weeks of that.<br /><br />3) iboga. intense. sometimes horrific. but you have a chance at seeing why you use pills or dope to begin...plus it has the amazing attribute which let&#039;s you come out the other side of the trip without any withdrawals. It is a strong spiritual antidote to cure the strong spiritual disease of addiction.<br /><br />getting off my soapbox now...&nbsp; &nbsp;thanks for listening!&nbsp; &nbsp;(crickets) :o)

				Ah i remember my first experience with opiates, about a year and a half ago when i had my wisdom teeth pulled, I got like 30 Oxycodone 5&#039;s, with 30 Ibuprophen 500&#039;s. Surprisingly the Ibuphrophen helped a lot more with the pain. So i saved all my Oxy&#039;s until after. Then took 1. The next night snorted one, the next night snorted 2, and then my intake kept going up from there. I was surprised by how tolerant i was. But then again i am a big guy, or it could just be in my head. Haven&#039;t messed with opiates in a while so hoping my tolerance has gone down a little, gonna invest in some 10mg&#039;s.

				Before SR, I had mostly ingested or snorted a few times some vicodin &amp; percocet over the years. Personally, experiences werent all that great so I didn&#039;t really see the draw of opiates (more a stimulant man myself).<br /><br />Once I found SR, decided to try out grandaddy opiate. I got a teeny bag of H and proceeded to snort itty bitty lines. WOW ok this made me see why people go apeshit over opiates.<br /><br />Don&#039;t even want to know how slamming it would feel.

				I originally created this conversion table on another forum, but I think the SR community could benefit from it as well.

				I noticed people talking about this in a few posts in this thread so I thought I&#039;d contribute. You CANNOT snort every single pill! You should NOT be snorting Vicodin, Norcos, Percs, etc. Think about how much powder you&#039;re actually putting up your nose, and how little of that powder by weight is the actual drug. For these pills it could be as little as 2% by weight, and you are snorting a LOT of powder. Once you coat your sinuses with powder, snorting any more is not going to do anything except block up your nose and damage your nasal membranes. Not to mention the acetaminophen in these pills can be harmful to your nose, and the fact that these pills work perfectly well taken orally.<br /><br />For these reasons you should not snort any codeine or hydrocodone pills, nor any oxycodone pills less than 30mg/pill. You should not snort anything with Tylenol or Advil in it (Norco, Vicodin, Percocet, etc.). <br /><br />It&#039;s true that some pills are better snorted than eaten -- this is true for Opana (oxymorphone) and Dilaudid (hydromorphone). These are probably a waste to eat and so should be snorted instead. I would start with 2-3mg oxymorphone or 2-4mg hydromorphone with no tolerance. Make sure you crush the pill into a very fine powder and use a rolled up piece of paper to make sure it actually gets into your nasal passages instead of just getting stuck in your nose. Even though you might feel like a bad ass using a dollar bill, do not put any currency in your nose that has been in your possession for less than 72 hours -- though it&#039;s unlikely, it is possible to contract Hep C from a dollar bill.<br /><br />Stay safe guys, and keep those sinuses healthy. Not taking proper care of your nose (by snorting things you should) can lead to damage of the sinuses resulting in greater change of infection and even loss of sense of smell. You don&#039;t want that just to get high! Always do some research to make sure you should be snorting something before you just go and stick every powder you find up your nose.

				Ahhh---the ol&#039; Opiate topic, I love getting alerted that this topic has a new post, near and dear to me. <br /><br />To the guy posting about his history (R8 something or other), I hope your name on the SR site is something different.

I always use the old adage around here, &quot;never reveal anything too personal&quot; - the most I get personal about is my drug of choice/preference (of the moment, which is good for me, because it changes a lot, lol.)<br /><br />To the guy posting about the dangers of snorting any type of opiates, thanks for the reminder. Due to the overwhelming propensity, that there just very well may be some 12 or 13 year old newbie on here, looking for a quick fix, and having no clue, he/she may just decide to snort whatever he/she gets his hands on (I mean, lord knows that show Intervention shows you how to get off on just about ANYTHING these days).<br /><br />For those of you who will be buying/wanting Norco/Vic/Percs and you should NOT be snorting them, there are a few methods for filtering your pills. Try googling, but&nbsp; the one that has been successful for me, is 1) Grind/smash your pill(s) to a powder form, the more powdery the better, 2) get a coffee filter (preferably the brown, non-bleached) and get it &quot;damp&quot;. Place in the freezer for a few minutes. 3) Place filter over a cup. 4) place the powder you&#039;ve ground into filter, and pour approximately 1/8 of a cup of water over the filter/powder. Voila, you should now have a liquid which is acetaminophen/filler (or damn near close to it).... free, and just drink and enjoy.

				Just wanted to add my 2 BTC&#039;s worth, don&#039;t snort Oxy/Hydro etc. the pills are made with binders and meant tho be swallowed. The binders are digested by your stomach acid and not meant to be absorbed by your nasal passages. Also, the bio-availability of snorting an Oxy is quite low, you will just waste quite a few of them to get the same effect of swallowing them. Be safe friends and to the Vet from Afghanistan in the previous post....Thank you, sincerely for your service!

				I was gonna start a new thread, but i figured i could get some good info right here on the opiate conversation.<br /><br />Im interested in the differences in the high between Black Tar H, and Opium.&nbsp; I know the science behind the two and how each is made/ comes from, but ive never smoked raw or refined opium and just started getting into bth. How do they compare when smoked? <br /><br />I would imagine opium takes a shit load of hits to get off, but can you get a nice nod on? Also does anyone prefer one to the other? Ive tried nearly every opiate on the market except the original pure opium, and believe me its on my to do list. Any info is appreciated. Thanks&nbsp; :)

				No worries. Thanks for the answers +1. Holy shit though, 30 to 40 grams of opium? That would cost me $1000 bucks if i ordered it on SR. Smoking 10grams of H is a crazy high amount too, no offense, but im poor and could in no way support that kinda habit. Hmm so its like you need 4 times the amount of opium for a similar high to H? I think ill stick with H, and maybe when i hit the lotto ill order some opium, lol. <br /><br />

				Hello SR!<br />For the past couple years, I&#039;ve been shooting an 80mg oxy every 9 months, after spending two years using pretty much daily. Usually, I&#039;ll do 50-60mg first, wait about an hour, and do the rest. Now I&#039;m getting some quality shit from Tomorrowman (amazing vendor btw), and it&#039;s my first purchase on SR as well as my first real H since 2006, since the area I&#039;m in now is completely dry except for pharms. I&#039;m hoping to get a really amazing rush, and do a little bit of nodding on my first shot, which should be Monday. It seems, though, that every single place online gives me a different estimation for how much I should do. My tolerance shouldn&#039;t be high at all. I had a day with some percocets a month and a half ago, and a month before that an 80mg oxy. Other than that, no opiates since last summer. The answers I&#039;ve found online range from 10mg-150mg. I&#039;m thinking 40 or 50 should be good, according to an earlier conversion? Any advice?

				Just to throw in my two cents on this thread:<br />I will NEVER IV anything.&nbsp; Something about putting a needle in your arm other than a doctor taking/extracting blood and that&#039;s as far as it goes with me, other than being in the hospital after a horrible accident and I need a morphine drip or something, but that&#039;s it. <br /><br />If I have oxy/hydro with any sort of acetaminophen in it, I will crush it up and parachute it/ or do a CWE. <br />If I have pure oxy like roxies, then I snort those.&nbsp; I wish the Oxy 80s were crush able again, but apparently there is some way to get rid of the abuse-proof on it, but it is too much work and I don&#039;t have the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />My favorite:&nbsp; the 30mg roxies to snort. Anything else, I will parachute or CWE, but that its it for me and its good. <br /><br />Good Times!

BTW when cooking the oxy, right before it will start turning the nice golden tan color, it looks like the powder melts down and turns translucent (see through) don&#039;t worry shortly thereafter it will start turning the golden tan color. hope that helps..

The less tolerance you have, the finer that line is, and when you are talking about a drug that is measured ug&#039;s (not even sure what that unit is in comparison to, say, micrograms)....well.... remember to make your last will and testament. <br />If you really intend to go ahead, there appear to be at least one Dutch vendor selling nasal sprays, don&#039;t take my word for it- just had quick glance, they appear to be proper manufactured nasal sprays, not made up by some individual. If they are genuine- they should be of an accurate dosage/strength, wiki usually has the various LD50s of most drugs and the recreational- but even then, I would double check or triple check from a reliable site- just google &quot;recreational dosage for fentanyl&quot;, then try a quarter of that amount first, different people can have different tolerances- check up on potentiators- if you were unknowingly taking something that is an opiate potentiator, I do know that grapefruit juice can make some drugs much stronger in effect (not sure if that applies to opiates, only recently got interested in the idea of potentiators). Last thing is, have a reliable friend with you, ready to call an ambulance, preferably someone that knows CPR.<br />Last, last advice is try smoking some No.3 heroin or snorting some white No.4 instead.<br />Good luck!!!!

				Hmmm. No reason I&#039;m looking at fentanyl in particular, besides that every other opiate on here seems to be pricey as shit. <br /><br />At that, do you have any suggestions for some decent priced opiates? <br /><br />I was thinking about getting bulk codiene+promethaziene. If your average codeine dose is 100mg, the listing I was looking at won&#039;t get me nearly the hits I was wanting for the money if it&#039;s just codeine by itself. Anyone know how significant the potentiation is of promethazine? What about DXM? (i.e., increases it by a factor of 3)

				I&#039;ve tried Nytol (Diphenhydramine) with heroin No.3, apparently, the one a night type is the one you need (has more in), I took 4, and although it certainly has some effect- I could not honestly say, for example- it doubled the effect of the H. This is because, it does not really mimic the H, or intensify, it is more as though you are taking another drug on top of the H. To a person with no H experience to compare it against, perhaps they would enjoy the effects, but to me, I don&#039;t really enjoy it- I am looking for the true effects of pure, powerful heroin, not this fucked up high.<br />As for codeine, it does not have the full range of enjoyable effects that heroin has, or BTH (no experience of). My favourite is some quality No.3 heroin, run up and down the foil, a quick one hit pipe of ganj, rol it up, roll it down, little hit of ganj, little nod, rol it up roll it down..... you get the idea!, most enjoyable way of wasting away the day!!!

				Cant say that im not a little jealous of you there Anon with all those goodies and that week ahead of you bub. Enjoy it!<br /><br />I was reading about that microwave tek a few posts back and thats pretty bad ass. Could anyone give an approximate time for that before you stop it? Like how much time do I set my microwave for, and approx time for the cooking to complete. Is that really safe to shoot though?<br /><br />I know this has been asked before, but does anyone have a easy tek that I could use to make #4 smokable? I know it would have to be made back into base form, but im not sure how to go about that exactly.<br /><br />Thanks

				Well the general consensus seems to be that codeine sucks dick and fentanyl&nbsp; is not something to be fucked with(ironic that these were the opiates I was considering). Well, I&#039;m looking for a cheap opiate. All the Rx hydrocodone and oxycodone or SR seems to be way overpriced. So that in mind, i&#039;m looking for an opiate that is cheap, and has a high oral bioavailability. <br /><br /><br />Right now I&#039;m looking into heroin(pricy, but seems only to be so in high doses). I&#039;m thinking I can mix the powder at like 20-30 mg doses with like 100mg of DXM and then put that into a gel capsule.

But.... heroin whether No.3 or No.4 has a very low absorption when you eat it- much better to snort- No.4 (if you don&#039;t inject-which is akin to &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; unless you have experience, tolerance tec, or smoke No3, snorting No.3 can be very nice- some batches seem better suited to this ROA (route of administration) than others (in my experience).

				Isn&#039;t No 4 Heroin just pure diacytlmorphine? I&#039;m pretty sure I read from a reputable source that diacytlmorphine has like 60% oral bioavailibity. <br /><br /><br /><br />I would also like to point out that when writing &quot;diacytlmorphine&quot;, it was auto corrected to &quot;anthropomorphic&quot;.

				Monkey water? Yea when u mix your tar and water and instead of inject drip it in your nose?<br /><br />Bro you would be better off buying #4 IMO<br /><br />Also to the guy asking about <br /><br />Mrdutchguy the one with the nasal and pure fent powder, if u have no opiod tolerance i would shot one shot in your nostril and see how that does first man,seriously that is POTENT SHIT!! my best friend died from it..<br /><br />Iv got a couple grams on the way from MR dutch guy but iv got a 10+ year opiate tolerance, i could at onoe time In my heavy heavy use days like up tpo 4 80mg oc (the original ones a day) i could open a gel patch 100MCG and lick it all and be fucked out my mind...<br /><br />see fent doesn go by MG useually it goes by MCG-MICROGRAMS&nbsp; 100mg would drop u dead as a fucking corpse..lol

				byner I gotta tell you the truth dude, opiates are expensive. and if you serious about getting the best bang for your buck, you might have to put your nose to work a little.<br />&nbsp;if your only doing it once and a while it wont do much damage, just dont go sniffing anything with binders in it such as those nasty gels they put into pills nowadays. <br /><br />don&#039;t get the fentanyl that&#039;s just suicide. <br /><br />oxycodone is the shit but its real expensive. but for an occasional high the $15-30 tops it will take someone with a low tolerance to get fucked up(and I mean it WILL get you fucked up) on a roxy is well worth it.<br /><br />&nbsp;#4 looks to be affordable if you buy it in a little bit of a larger amount than just a bag(.250-1gram)
