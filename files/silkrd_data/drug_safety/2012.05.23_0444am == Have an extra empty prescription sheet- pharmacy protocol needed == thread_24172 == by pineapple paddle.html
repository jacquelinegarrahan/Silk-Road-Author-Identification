				They check with the doctor. There is also a DEA control number (or something). Its not as easy as just writing down what you want on paper and handing it over to the pharmacist. <br />This is a bad idea and is much more likely to end you up behind bars than just ordering what you wanted from SR. George Bush&#039;s daughter got busted doing this a few years back. Even the President&#039;s daughter couldn&#039;t get away with it.

				They will look mainly at the DEA number and whether or not it matches the system. If something seems off, then they will usually call the hospital for verification, and (depending on your location) controlled substances can only be phoned in, not scripted. <br /><br />Your best bet is to buy off of SR. It will save you future jail time as well as humiliation. You&#039;d be surprised how many people try to photocopy scripts, write fake ones, or try to alter the script. <br /><br />sdesu<br />

				Actually, in my experience, and definitely in recent years, most controlled substances MUST be scripted, and very specifically, I might add.&nbsp; I know this because I&#039;ve actually had pharmacies refuse to fill my meds because my doctors&#039; did not write them EXACTLY how the DEA wants.<br /><br />They usually require name, birthdate, address, name of drug, exact dosage prescribed, including combination medications like Percocet which have to show the mg amount of each drug, for example &quot;Percocet 10/325&quot;, also quantity prescribed, which must include a numeric and written amount on the script(&quot;30&quot; and &quot;thirty&quot;), and dosing instructions.&nbsp; Not to mention the DEA # and doctor&#039;s signature and contact information.&nbsp; <br /><br />Forging an RX is not something I recommend, especially since almost EVERY pharmacy uses cameras on the customers and employees now, and they also have to keep prescriptions for controlled substances for a very long period of time.
