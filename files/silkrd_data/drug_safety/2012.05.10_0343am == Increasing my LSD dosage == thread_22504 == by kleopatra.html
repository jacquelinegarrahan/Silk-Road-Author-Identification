				I&#039;ve done LSD four times now with my strongest experience being on 2 tabs of average blotter (100 mcg).&nbsp; I want to push the experience to another level but am unsure how much I should jump up from here.<br /><br />Anyone have any experience with this?&nbsp; In peoples experience, how much different is 2 tabs than 4 tabs? Or 2 tabs from 3 tabs?<br /><br />I will definitely be in a controlled setting, in my own home, with a trip sitter.&nbsp;

				In many of my early experiences, the difference at the time between 2 and 4 was huge. The more I was experienced with it, the less the difference was.

				I find that after doing psychedelics enough times you get psychologically conditioned. Last year I remember this crazy mushroom night with 12 people and I probably only had a half quarter but I was rolling around in this sandbox laughing my ass off like a fool. More recently I find myself taking 3 hits of lsd and wandering the streets and forest by myself at night, high as fuck but completely in control. In fact I find the outside world gets scarier when I am tripping with others than when I am by myself. I find I can think more clearly when I take lsd, everything looks and feels whack but mentally I have the same rational internal ego as when I&#039;m sober. Basically I wouldn&#039;t worry about taking too much, but then again it affects everyone differently. But then yet again you don&#039;t know what it will be like until you just eat however much it is and see for yourself. Bottom line is that if you&#039;re otherwise healthy and its legit lsd it wont kill you or be a lasting detriment in any way.

				Go for three. 300 is standard 60&#039;s mindblowing dose.
