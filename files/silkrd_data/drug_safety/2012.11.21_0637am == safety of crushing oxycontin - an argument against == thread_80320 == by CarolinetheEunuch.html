				Now obviously I&#039;m talking about the older oxycontin that doss NOT block all absorption upon contact with hunan skin/saliva/blood if the outer coating is removed, This makes crushing possible, allowing you to get the full extended release dose at once.<br /><br />You&#039;ve already heard the argument that almost all oxy overdoses are caused this way, and that it busts your body&#039;s tolerance system by flooding it with an unexpected surplus of opiates. But there&#039;s another argument. Personally, I&#039;m not into the &#039;rush&#039; from opiates - I used to love that from XTC in my rave days, but I find the opiate &#039;rush&#039; to be heavily psychosomatic. As a primarily psychosomatic response, you&#039;ll be able to get multiple rushes over the course of the drug, as it&#039;s more about the anticipation than the drug- chemically, it&#039;s a sedative, so it doesn&#039;t GIVE you any chemical &#039;rush&#039; (unlike stimulants), Not trying to shit on the experience of many other silk road folK, many of who have lots more practical experience than me, but from a pure chemistry perspective, tge impotance of the rush from opiates should be minimal compared to that from stimulants,<br /><br />Back to the original question. Golden rule of opiates that I&#039;m sure you all know very very well - you can always take more, but you can&#039;t take less after ingestion. Nor crushing them means that you can keep adding every 20 minutes until the person has hit their &#039;sweet spot&#039; (plus if they feel they\re OD&#039;g, they&#039;ll have a MUCH better chance of surviving for the paramedics to get there with a crash cart and ambulance,<br /><br />I like my strong high as much as anyone, but if you&#039;ve reached a state where you can&#039;t even pony up $50 to get a couple more strong oxycontin, then you should probably be taking a break from opiates and get a job for a while, I&#039;m not stating my own profession/expertise on a public format, but much of this is advice distilled from a paramedic (ambulance emergency worker, ie, first on scene - AND NOT ME) who likes to party with me, but being medically inclined lays this stuff out as ground rules (I could give you his full list if folks want). Hehe, one thing I got from him I&#039;&#039;m NOT sharing is a list of &#039;plausible but undiagnosable&#039; sets of medical symptoms for whenever you want a day off work, You know how these things go - somehow it goes viral and henceforth useless.<br /><br />It makes a lot of sense to me - an insignificant amount of extra cost if you&#039;re working, plus a full 8-12 hour high - why risk an OD (and waste the rest of the high) by going for 1 minute of rush?

				That&#039;s pretty good advice. Snorting anything can cause severe nasal and even respiratory problems over the long term. The active ingredient in pills is generally only a very small part of the pill and the rest is binders and fillers and all kinds of other crap that was never meant to taken any other way besides oral ingestion. You&#039;ll literally tear holes in your septum if you do it enough and when you snort stuff up your nose some of it can end up being inhaled and taken to the lungs and cause all kinds of nasty infections and whatnot. Snorting doesn&#039;t give much of a rush anyway and usually doesn&#039;t last as long. Some pills just aren&#039;t all that active this way anyway and they just drip down your throat and by that point you might as well take them orally. I recommend people that use pills and want them to kick in faster is to simply crush them and swallow with a big glass of water. If you pour it right down the throat, you shouldn&#039;t really taste it anyway.<br /><br />I think you are confusing what the word &quot;depressant&quot; means medically. Depressants are just any drug that can slow down your respiritory rate and pulse. It doesn&#039;t mean they slow you down or make you depressed or anything like that necessarily. While I guess opiates could be considered &quot;depressants&quot; the true depressants are drugs like alcohol, the minor tranquilizers like Valium,Xanax, and the &quot;major tranquilizers&quot; like the old school neuroleptics like Thorazine and Haldol.<br /><br />Injecting drugs IM or IV can actually be really safe if you have pure drugs, strict control over doses, and clean equipment and practices. Although the risk of addictive is increased by these methods.
