				Hi, I take around 100 Oxy a day, sometimes I&#039;ll chew or snort what ever I feel like but not often, altho i do have the odd weekend blow outs, lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just realised my meds will run out tonight, but I have 60mg MS Contin, Morphine Sulphate pills. And I also have Oramorph the liquid stuff, my tolerance is up to about 400mg Oxy when I have new perscription full but generally its around to 100mg mark I take daily.<br /><br />If I take these will they stave off the Oxy withdraws? Does anyone have any experience on this as stuff I&#039;ve read on net says both things<br /><br />cheers and thx in advance.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have more Oxy by Thurs so don&#039;t have to long to wait, phew ???<br />

				Yes, the Morphine Sulphate pills will most likely stave off WD&#039;s.&nbsp; All these products are opiates.&nbsp; They are just of varying strengths.<br /><br />If you look at an opiate equivalency chart you will see that all the opiates are listed as equal in strength to a multiple of morphine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oxycodone is equivalent to 1.5-2.0 times the dose of morphine.&nbsp; In other words you need 2mg of Morphine to equal 1mg of Oxycodone.<br /><br />I would suggest you wait until you feel slightly down and then take one of the 60mg MS Contin&#039;s and see how that works out.&nbsp; You may need to take another half or whole one to equal the 100mg of Oxy you take a day.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken pretty much all the different forms of opiates available.&nbsp; Codeine, Morphine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Methadone, Diamorphine, Heroin, Hydromorphone, Oxymorphone) and the only difference is the strength of each, although the high from Heroin is different than that from Oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; They all do the job of keeping you WD&#039; free.

				Thank you as this sort of answer was just what I was looking for, no idea why I tried net 1st ???<br /><br />Yeah its working so far; my 12 hours for Oxy is well over and usually WD&#039;s would be here by now, easily by 9th hour mark these days. So I took the 60, quite liked the feeling as slightly different so I took another about an hour after lol&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Now you have got me interested; with H sound like I might have to try some as I like the sound of what I have read about it so far.<br /><br />I know the conversions for Oxy to morphine but as always start little with any Morphine as death ain&#039;t funny, always a rule of thumb I tell my mates.<br />thanking you again

				Yes, it is always a good idea to start with a smaller dose whenever you crossover on opiates. H can be even more dangerous.<br /><br />With H you never know from one batch to the next what the exact strength will be.&nbsp; That&#039;s how too many users end up overdosing.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say their normal dose is 100mg two or three times a day.&nbsp; They get a new batch which turns out to be two or three times as strong as their normal batch, they go ahead and IV 100 or 150mg and then next thing they know they have passed out and stopped breathing.<br /><br />I always start small with a new batch.&nbsp; Instead of 100mg I&#039;ll take 25mg and wait 10-15 minutes to see how it&#039;s going, then I&#039;ll take more.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same with different opiates.&nbsp; Something like fenatyl is 50-100 times stronger than morphine.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the strongest and most dangerous of the opiates and you better really know what you are doing before using it. <br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies, I always like to hear peeps views or experience they know about drugs, never hurts to educate yourself even a little more.<br /><br />Yeah I was on Fenatyl when in hospital after our smash, me and my partner both in fact. No idea what strength as wasn&#039;t really into drugs then, I/we just started again after a fair few years out since we had a horrific vehicle crash, not our fault, :( but since leaving hispital we&#039;ve always been on an optiate of such, been thro most of them now with Oxy being current.<br /><br />When I passed my motorbike test, er I&#039;ll say just over a decade ago now :D, the instruction rider was well into drugs. On this day he was white as a sheet, we knew each other from bike rallies and such and smoke tuns o weed, took mushrooms together, so had a pretty good friendship. <br /><br />So he opened up to me an hour or so later, in peaces he was; a couple o weeks earlier he&#039;d been at he brothers place, his bro had got a good stash of H, and him and a few others just took before this My trainer arrived for a session, literally 5 mins as he said.<br />So he joined in and said that he hoped everyone had tried a little to test its strength (he was lot more experienced with drugs then all the others), well they hadn&#039;t, they just cooked up and injected etc well he shit himself, took tester for himself and realised it was strong, very strong.<br /><br />So he started to panic and with good cause as the rest inc his brother all passed out. He had sense of mind to quickly phone an ambulance and speed was on their side. I think there was 5 in total with my trained being the 6th, his brother died from it and 1 other, the other 3 where more hardcore so that saved their lives.<br /><br />Ever since this tale, and I promise you that is what he told me, I have always noted about the tester and I&#039;ve applied it with all drugs I&#039;ve took, even ones I know are totally safe like dope.<br /><br />This trainer later killed himself; I went to a Scottish rally I&#039;d always go to expecting him there, eventually I caught up with his posse and they said he&#039;d topped himself, couldn&#039;t get over what happened to his bro as he always felt responsible for it - so he took an overdose.<br />So H took 2 lives in a way, sad but true.<br /><br />Its a event I&#039;ll never forget and will always try educate other because of it. man, he was such a lovely lad and only around 25yrs of age at a guess, what a waste, didn&#039;t know the bro<br />
