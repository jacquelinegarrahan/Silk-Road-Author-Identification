				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m told I need to crush up the Ketamine shards into powder. Whats the best way to do this? Same way as molly? with a spoon and a dollar bill over a mirror? I worry the powder will be more likely to stick to surfaces than molly? Sorry guys, i&#039;m kind of a newb with K and I&#039;m told its not good to rail the ketamine shards that look like long sticks? Any suggestions?

				It&#039;s fine to snort this ketamine, but you need to make sure you crush it EXTREMELY WELL, or it will be brutal to snort. There are a variety of ways that you can do this, a mortar and pestle (like for crushing herbs) works quite well and minimal product is lost that way. Make sure you keep going until it&#039;s nice and powdery, your nose will thank you later.

				Take a dollar bill and fold it in half.<br />Put the K inside the folded dollar and run a lighter or something hard over the dollar, you will be able to feel when its crushed enough to be snorted and the k wont stick to the cotton the dollar is made out of.<br /><br />Do a line about half the size of your pinky finger to start and then give it 10 min, you may be able to handle more. I recommend k-tripping with a friend.

				Firstly most definitely crush into a powder and most importantly keep hydrated and try to avoid alcohol&nbsp; a number of people in the UK have been discussing Ketamine cystitis which seems to be a growing issue Ketamine bladder syndrome is a relatively new worldwide phenomenon. First documented in 2007, the syndrome is a reported side-effect to ketamine use. Over the past few years, clinicians in Asia, Canada, the US, Europe and, more recently, the UK have reported treating teenage ketamine users who have presented with severe – and in some cases irreversible – bladder damage<br /><br />Patients may experience some or all the following symptoms:<br /><br />Increased day time frequency Voiding too often. Ketamine causes the bladder to shrink and become fibrotic, so that subsequently it can only hold a small amount of urine at a time.<br /><br />Urgency A sudden, compelling desire to urinate, which is difficult to defer.<br /><br />Urge urinary incontinence Involuntary leakage accompanied by urgency.<br /><br />Increased bladder sensation A persistent desire to void or a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.<br /><br />Pelvic, bladder and or urethral pain Suprapubic, or urethral pain related to bladder filling. It can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine and on voiding.<br /><br />Haematuria The appearance of blood in the urine, as the bladder can become ulcerated.<br /><br />Nobody really know what is causing this but the people I know who are users suggest it could be down to dehydration and people not crushing the K into powder and the crystals entering the bladder. Hope this helps

				Yep, you can put a dollar bill over it and energetically scrape over it with a credit card, or roll over it with a ligther/cup/dildo<br /><br />However some people don&#039;t like it they say money is dirty.&nbsp; Oh well, I personally haven&#039;t had any problems but they are right.<br /><br />Ketamine crystals can be dissolved in water and slowly boiled to evaporation.&nbsp; What you&#039;ll get in the end is a very fine powder.&nbsp; You don&#039;t boil the dissolved ketamine directly on the heat source, do it... I forget the term in English... in a metal container over boiling water.&nbsp; There&#039;s plenty of info on the internet on how to &quot;cook ketamine&quot; and much more on Erowid dare I say.<br /><br />If you&#039;re new to K and you have a gram sitting in front of you remember that just 1/10 can be a heavy dose.&nbsp; I recommend you find a scale that measures milligrams to get familiar with the doses.&nbsp; All dosage info is available on erowid.<br /><br />Snorting it btw isn&#039;t the &quot;best&quot; way to take it but it&#039;s recommended if you&#039;ve never tried it.<br /><br />HarmReduction is giving sound advice, if you&#039;re drinking alcohol limit yourself to small bumps.&nbsp; If you&#039;re taking a lot drink enough water as well, it&#039;s summer so you need to drink more than usual, have a cup&#039;a&#039;tea with it as well.
