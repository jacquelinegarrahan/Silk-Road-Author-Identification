				I had some speed. I figured in the pursuit of&nbsp; knowledge I would use it and compare the success of my meth experience. The stuff I got came as a white powder. Clumps easily. Has a bit of a smell that I can&#039;t put my finger on. Meth seems so much simpler by comparison. Anyways:<br /><br />Insufflated 20mg--figuring this should be a fine dose. A little boost of energy but not what I expected. <br />10 minutes later (fifteen minutes?) I administer about 43mg orally. If this doesn&#039;t give me something I&#039;m calling foul on this product.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m going to have a seat and see how much of this dry literature I can manage through. <br /><br />Cheers! (As ever, encouragement, admonishment, advice, comments are all welcome)<br /><br />T :20 -- sit down to get productive. Oral effects still lie ahead of me. Snorted still providing a minor boost.<br />T1:10 --noticeable effects from orally ingest speed. Keep getting distracted by social obligations but definite energy increase with a potential to focus better. Not the best environment for trying right now, admittedly.

				60mg of amphetamine seems rather high - I suppose street amphetamine is not as potent as the pharmaceutical kind?&nbsp; I only require 5 to 10mg of pharmaceutical dextroamphetamine for productivity enhancement, while for recreational purposes 30mg is quite sufficient.

				My feelings from this outing are mixed. It wasn&#039;t what I expected it to be. I wanted it to be much closer to meth than it was. I didn&#039;t really feel as good as meth made me feel. I didn&#039;t find it especially easy to focus (not after the snorting or the oral dose), I didn&#039;t even get a lot of feeling from the oral dose when it finally did kick in. I thought speed dosages were equated with meth dosages but I certainly didn&#039;t get very much out of the whole experience.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the compound I took was but it definitely wasn&#039;t dextro-amp (from what I understand, that would have onset some euphoria/good feelings). It may have been a bad batch but I got it from Mrfireuk who was supposed to be rather reputable. I may try it again sometime tomorrow (I got to get some work done and have barely done anything) and report back. If it fails another rigorous trial I&#039;ll just give it up and keep pursuing meth. There must be some large difference between the two.<br /><br />To answer painbow: Yes, they feel different in that meth is much more fun. I guess speed can be used to get work done but won&#039;t make you feel especially good about it (not the batch I&#039;ve tried anyways). <br /><br />Cheers!

				I think it was the batch. Dexedrine gives me a good euphoria every time.

				Try 80mg orally at once with MrFire&#039;s.<br />Or just buy from CC.

				Damn. Well, I guess I learned. I don&#039;t even know what to do with the rest of this shit now. Seeing as I don&#039;t know what it is I don&#039;t really want to take anymore.

Only a slight body buzz and main effects are over in 6 hours. <br /><br />Meth -- Lot&#039;s of energy / euphoria, but focus is normal. Get nice rushes through the body, and lasts 10+ hours. Also, I sweat like a mutha-fucker and have terrible body odor when on meth. <br /><br />

				well i think almost everyone agrees methamp is simply more euphoric than amphetamine. pharmie speed is what most are used to in the US, amphetamine sulfate in europe is usually whacked down pretty substantially, i&#039;ve heard anywhere from 5-25% purity is pretty common. it would be nice to get purity tested... i&#039;ve heard good things about boymaster&#039;s amph<br /><br />but yeah if you are used to meth then amphetamine will probably underwhelm. higher doses might make it more enjoyable
