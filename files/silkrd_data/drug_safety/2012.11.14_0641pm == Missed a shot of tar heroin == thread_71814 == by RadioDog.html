				This was about 3 weeks ago, I was in a hurry and missed about a 40 unit shot of tar H. It definitely got me pretty high still, but now I&#039;ve got this lump in my arm that wont go away. Is this something to be worried about? I&#039;ve missed with powder H before and it would maybe be a bump for a day, but this is 3 weeks later! <br /><br />I know it&#039;s probably nothing to worry about but I just wanted to see if anyone else has done this?

				You most likely have a calcification (mineral build up in the soft tissue) or an abscess in your arm. The former typically go away relatively quickly on their own, but considering it&#039;s been three weeks, I would highly recommend you go to the doctor because it&#039;s probably an abscess which are NOT to be taken lightly and can lead to serious bacterial infections. Consult medical attention as soon as you can, my friend. Be honest about the cause and they will help you.

				Damn that&#039;s not what I wanted to hear. I don&#039;t have health insurance. It&#039;s gotten a bit smaller over the weeks but it&#039;s definitely still there.
