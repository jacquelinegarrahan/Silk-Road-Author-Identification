				yea, like dat is nice, u can also go old school, by using a piece of carboard and a pin.. with a nice clear glass.. , trick to is u keep the flame close to it as possible without burning it. you then catch the vapor risin&#039; through the glass

Some full melt bubble would be better in a bowl with a screen. Harder hashes (Pressed) you can grind up (with the right grinder) into a dust and mix it in with your herb. Softer hashes you can roll into a a long thin pin and lay along your paper.<br /><br />Theres a million good ways to smoke hash, depends on the type you&#039;re looking at.<br /><br />Personally, full melt bubble or just pure wax. I suggest the wax.<br /><br />Weed is just the messenger, concentrate hash is the message!!!!

				1. put the hash on a table and light it using a lighter (matches not recommended)<br />2. when it starts to burn turn the fire off, and crumble the hash using your hands<br />3. put the hash into a pipe and smoke<br /><br />I do this almost everyday using a metal pipe, and it works great.

				If it&#039;s Moroccan or Afghan just break it into small bits and roll into a joint with tobacco or some weed. Or just whack it over a screen on a pipe/bong and smoke it as normal....<br />You shouldn&#039;t need to use a lighter to get it soft, if it is rock solid then it&#039;s likely been improperly stored for faaaar too long or it is low quality. Or both....<br />Good Moroccan is hard when cold but if you hold it in your hand or keep it in your pocket for a bit it goes really soft and sticky&nbsp; 8)<br />Afghan just generally sucks balls.<br /><br />For those more advanced hash connoisseurs - you can chase the purer extracts on foil. I made a batch of concentrate using acetone - it runs brilliantly and you can taste that you are getting nothing but vapor - no smoke in there at all! Just opened the door to a whole new realm of advanced concentrate consumption...... ::)<br /><br />

				it&#039;s usually quite hard when not heated, and burning it is the easiest way to get it to small enough pieces, at least from my experience.<br />also, i recommend using filters for your pipe, unless little pieces of hash burning your tongue is your goal.<br />
