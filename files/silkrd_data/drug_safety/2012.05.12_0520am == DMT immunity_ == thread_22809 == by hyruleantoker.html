			<dd class="postbody">
				Recently had a friend try to blast me off ~2 weeks ago, and hardly felt a thing.<br />The friend made sure I was vaporizing it correctly, and watched four good long tokes. Doubting the potency, he decided to hit it immediately after and see, and was knocked on his ass after two tokes.<br />The most I felt was maybe a little more spacey than a big high with cannabis, but not much.<br />Tried again a few nights later while rolling some nice MDMA, and got a slightly better effect, but still no blastoff.<br /><br />We&#039;ve speculated as to why there was no breakthrough, and came up with a few possibilities.<br />- Whatever entities (we called &#039;em light beings) have jurisdiction over that place, may have denied me entry.<br />- I may have been in the wrong state of mind, or perhaps I&#039;m not connected enough to my subconscious. I very rarely remembers my dreams.<br />- Possible immunity to the effects of DMT, or perhaps a much higher tolerance. <br /><br />Is it possible to be completely immune to the effects of DMT? What would be the risk of trying a higher dose?<br /><br /><br />edit: removed swim

				knock the SWIM crap off, that stuff doesnt protect you from anything here or on the clearnet<br /><br />you may have a higher tolerance, are you on any SSRI&#039;s/SNRI&#039;s because those would increase tolerance?<br /><br />also if you burnt the dmt or failed to hold it in long enough or didnt really get much in you wont get a crazy effect from it<br /><br />i&#039;d try the same dose again but focus on holding it in for 10-15 seconds and making sure when you exhale there is a bit of smoke (if theres none you may have taken none in), and make sure you dont burn it

				Thanks for the reply and tip.<br /><br />I&#039;m not on any meds at all. We didn&#039;t even so much as smoke weed before either.<br /><br />My friend is pretty damn smart about it, going so far as to hold the lighter himself, and telling me to make sure I had smoke.<br />I held each toke as long as I could, and he even stopped me after the fourth, because he was positive that I would be gone.<br />Again, I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t burn it because he hit it right after me and felt it.<br /><br />What I&#039;m planning on doing now is working on my dreams, and remembering them. We&#039;ll see if that helps at all.<br /><br />How long should one typically wait before trying again?

				sounds like you weren&#039;t pulling hard enough. <br /><br />or pulling too hard. <br /><br />otherwise i don&#039;t know what to say. maybe a week between trying, although if you didn&#039;t feel shit, then there&#039;s no reason to bother really... just go again whenever.

				I do have a habit of ripping pieces pretty hard... If pulling too hard would really make such a noticeable difference, I will definitely try to slow it down next time.<br /><br />Thanks!

				it&#039;s aiight. it wouldnt make sense that your friend would get tore up and you wouldnt feel jack... i know its gotta be hotter than weed smoke, but at the same time, if it gets too hot, it&#039;ll just decompose :S

				you should load it with a dose you know, say 20-40mg, and if your on the fourth toke and there is still something to vaporize that means your not being effecient enough<br /><br />usually you need to wait atleast an hour between trying, maybe longer<br /><br />what was the dosage you were using? if you can sucessully inhale/vape 40-60mg without burning and within 60 seconds you should blast off from what i&#039;ve heard.. <br /><br />personally i still have some technique issues to workout myself, or maybe need to just get a GVG :)

				I don&#039;t know the dose he loaded the piece with. He has customized one of his pipes and turned it into something he calls &#039;The Machine&#039;. Apparently something you can look up online, it&#039;s basically just iron wool that you melt the DMT into and hit like that.<br />Pulling too fast does seem like a likely possibility, so that will be something I focus a lot on the next time we try.<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies. Just one last question: Is it actually possible at all to be immune to the full effects of DMT? Yes or no. I would love if I could hear a solid answer on that.

				Are you on any sort of medication? Were you on any other drugs at the time?<br /><br />I still can&#039;t imagine that any other drug would completely negate the DMT. Maybe you just need to take&nbsp; bigger hit next time? Weird..

				I have to assume you were hitting it wrong. I gave some to my friend recently and he didn&#039;t feel anything either. Once the smoke got in him he just got the most painful look on his face, it was upsetting to see all of that beautiful DMT smoke being coughed back out into the air. I guess it&#039;s just something you need to get used to.

				Let me tell you this, Iv experiencing many things on dmt, yet no contact that a could discern with an &quot;other&quot;. I stopped and waited over 6 months to try smoking again. The archetype of an &quot;other&quot; and contact with was what I was hearing about and wanted most. I could barely find dimensionally over there. The last time I smoked it after waiting over 6 months from the previous time....I didnt use an oil pipe to smoke it. I packed this certain bubbler of mine with just way to much DMT and the bubbler&nbsp; had the quality of having a large smoke chamber as well as being able to fill itself completely without lettting much into my mouth until I pulled the GOG bowl and carbed it. Immediatly there was No-thing. Not nothing but NO-thing. No space, no time, no color, no qualia, no thought, no me, no you , non-ness to the core. It was Non-duality. It was Nirvana, It was EVERYTHING. Samahati. I am that I am. I am god. I AM! (The unexplainable, un-talkable, truly all that is)..It took me over a year to integrate that into my proceeding life. After awhile I wanted to show my friends the possibility with this compound.<br /><br />&nbsp;I had flew to Ohio to show my friend and we had rented a hotel room. Lights off, get comfortable, clear your mind of expectations and here we go......Problem was , it wasnt working for him. I asked &quot;buddy, you dont feel a thing? you dont see any distortion of any type? you dont even see a tracer?&quot; he wasnt feeling a thing. I loaded up more and more until the amount he was smoking was just way to much and I had to call a stop to this. We sat there, both a little upset about the outcome, I really was bewildered. I took the pipe and took one massive hit off just the leftovers in the pipe and I was SAILING.( the first hit of dmt in over a year since my experience of nonduality) Once I came back, we sat there again, pondering the possibility. I had heard Terence Mckenna talk about a very small percentage of people who do not experience DMT when they tried. So we let the night pass and ate some MESCAL I brought&nbsp; the next day. It was a great trip but I could tell my buddy was still weirded out about the DMT.<br /><br />I started to speculate that it might have been all the ADHD meds like ritalin and such they used to have him on in school. My buddy was always a little &quot;off&quot; to the folks who dared not look at there own &quot;offness&quot;. We decided that next time I was in Ohio that we would try ayahuasca. That depending on how that went, we would try preloading him with MAIO and that Id try to bring a more purified product next time (even though the dmt was good already) to smoke.<br /><br />I would look into what Terence Mckenna had to say about this, I know Iv heard him talk about this in one of his DMT speeches.<br /><br /><br />ps...about the beings of light....I never got my contact on the other side. But out in the mountains this last year growing herb , I made contact in &quot;normal reality&quot; with these being of light in the redwood trees. They told me telepathically when I asked for who they were that they were the &quot; The keepers of Light&quot;. The experience had a DMT quality to it. I mean....the experience visually didnt feel DMT. But something was DMT about it. I told my grow buddy&nbsp; about the experience except the DMT quality part. And he made mention to another grower out there who made this comment &quot; Oh man those are the DMT angels, I have breakfast with them almost every morning&quot;<br />I just thought it was interesting that the two times I came in contact with these things I wasnt tripping, And its always been 4-6 in the morning,(breakfeast-ish time) and my mind gets convinced that DMT has something to do with this, every time. <br />Good luck on your journey my brother. I hope the beings of light bless you with there presence someday.&nbsp; Try the redwood mountains, off the eel river....up in the redwoods early morning.......
