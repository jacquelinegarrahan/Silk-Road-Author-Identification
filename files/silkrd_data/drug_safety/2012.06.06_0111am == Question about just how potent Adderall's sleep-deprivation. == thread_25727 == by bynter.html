				I haven&#039;t had school for the last two days, and have stayed up for two days straight. I got another 5 hours of school work ahead of me, leaving with 11 hours before I have to turn all this stuff in at school. So what do I do? should I risk going to sleep in five hours, when there&#039;s a good chance I&#039;ll oversleep, or is Adderall powerful enough to get me through this night and the next day? I&#039;ve heard conflicting parties, one tell me you&#039;ll crash at 50 hours, another said you can stay awake with Adderall until you die.

				How long does it actually take to die taking aderall to stay awake before you die?<br /><br />Staying awake for 50 hours is somewhat problematic: It&#039;s not likely to kill you, but i doubt you will function very well after being awake that long. Perhaps grabbig a couple of hours of sleep would be a good idea, even if it it less then 5.

				I say get a few hour nap, set plenty of alarms, wake up and take the Adderall. <br />That&#039;s the safest.<br /><br />Unsafe would be to stay up and take the Adderall. Never went days on end with it, yet I personally can&#039;t see crashing on it.

If I start sleeping, I really don&#039;t think my body is going to want to get up anytime soon. Perhaps I could set my alarm clock for 5 hours afterwards, wait til the adderall wears off, then take some caffiene and get to sleep before the caffiene kicks in. Could that work?

				I&#039;ve been there done that. <br /><br />First and foremost:&nbsp; STAY AWAY ROM THE CAFFEINE!!!&nbsp; At this point it will only make the bad side effects of the adderall more apparent and you WILL crash/nod. Your best bet at this point is to just try and stay awake.

				This perhaps is just me, but on adderall I tend to have trouble going to sleep, but it&#039;s easier for me to wake up and even on weekends I wake up earlier than I would have if I hadn&#039;t taken my pill the day before. LSD/Shrooms are the same way for me, trouble going to sleep the night I trip but seem to wake up earlier than I wanted to.<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d go to sleep for however long you can and have someone (or 2 if your friends are as useless as mine) who knows the situation and will make sure you&#039;re up on time, even if you have to crash at a friends place.

				Well I seemed to get enough out of the experience that i decided to make such a thing. However, I just happened to be on adderall when I made the list. And, well jotting a few ideas down onto a paper became a bit more than that. So perhaps you people could read it? (located in off topic)<br /><br /><br />So anyways. I still have to come down off of this stuff. Considering I haven&#039;t eaten or slept in about 80 hours, what can i expect this to be like and what is there anything i could do to prepare for it?

				I did the same damn thing years ago when I first got my hands on some XRs. Those things can be brutal.<br /><br />You shocked your brain with amph and you are probably depleted of dopamine. I took me a few days to feel back to normal when I did this. Felt like a zombie for awhile. I would recommend taking a 5-HTP supplement once in the morning and once before bed. Smoke plenty of weed if you have the resources. There is a thread somewhere here in drug safety about safely using methamphetamine (which turns out is not much different than the d-amphetamine which you took) that cites research finding that cannabis lowers the neurotoxicity of amphetamines. Couldn&#039;t hurt in your case and will at least take some of the edge off and stimulate your appetite hopefully.<br /><br />You are also probably dehydrated. Drink plenty of water. Even better, drink an energy drink or some coconut water to replenish electrolytes. Eat bananas for potassium and more hydration.<br /><br />Hang in there brother. I wanted to off myself after that 3rd day with no sleep. You will be back to normal soon enough and this will be a good story to tell your friends about. Oh yeah, lay off the adderall for a few weeks to let your brain catch up. Hope this helps, let us know how it goes. Peace and love.<br /><br /><br />

				Ive gone on an adderall binge before.. It was around finals time and I couldn&#039;t sleep for 3 days. I got in a nasty pattern of taking adderall late at night to finish schoolwork, and then would toss and turn all night, then get up in the morning with zero sleep whatsoever, and I&#039;d feel so tired that I&#039;d need more adderall just to make it through the day. The process continued until I crashed hard on the 3rd day right after my exam. It was horrible. I was slightly hallucinating from the lack of sleep. <br /><br />And I notice that if you&#039;re sleep deprived, adderall won&#039;t help with your focus. It still has the stimulation effect where you can&#039;t sleep, but it was not helping me focus on my schoolwork. So it works best when your well rested. Learned my lesson and I dose more accordingly now. I&#039;ll still have insomnia now and then but I won&#039;t redose past noon the next day.

				Best thing you can do to lessen the crash (aside from sleep) is to eat the most epic breakfast in the world when you wake up (Not McDonalds or anything like that.) Something healthy and filling with lots of vitamins. If you ever saw that movie &quot;Pleasantville&quot; you know what I&#039;m talking about. Flapjacks, french toast, hamsteak, eggs, biscuits and gravy, but don&#039;t forget some fresh fruit as well. and then after you take a little post-breakfast nap, you should be fine.

				Three days without sleep? Whoa how do you guys do it haha, I did an adderall binge once but luckily I had xanax so I just took a bar and passed out and had the best sleep of my life. You still feel like crap the next day though because your brain is recovering but I suggest taking multi-vitamins and eat lots of frutis/veggies and of course drink lots of water. I still think drinking a bunch of alcohol is the worst comedown, at least for me. The next day I can&#039;t do anything but lay down and hate my life. I would recommend getting xanax or some type of benzo to help with any type of stimulant binge.

				Ten hours of sleep and only like a bagel and some chili(which gave me stomach ache and in took some pepto bismo). How that suffices to keep me functional, i have no idea. I was also really anxious last night, wouldve taken some loraxepam but i was sleeping fasr enough anyways. Right now, I&#039;m in sort of a lethargic state. When I think of things i could do to make me happy, absolutely nothing comes to mind.

				Yea. You just got the typical seritonin/dopamine depletion. the best thing is a multivitamin, some 5-htp and maybe some dopa if you could get it (the only dopamine precursor I can think of at the time). and try to eat some more, especially fruit. you&#039;ll be alright in a day or two.

Whoa how do you guys do it haha, I did an adderall binge once but luckily I had xanax so I just took a bar and passed out and had the best sleep of my life. You still feel like crap the next day though because your brain is recovering but I suggest taking multi-vitamins and eat lots of frutis/veggies and of course drink lots of water. I still think drinking a bunch of alcohol is the worst comedown, at least for me. The next day I can&#039;t do anything but lay down and hate my life. I would recommend getting xanax or some type of benzo to help with any type of stimulant binge.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you skip 2 nights of sleep you&#039;ll be pretty fucked up, regardless of whatever you took to endure that. <br /><br />I would simply suggest sleeping whenever you feel like it. Vitamins will not do you any good in such a situation. The problem is not skipping a night or two of sleep, its making up for that loss :)

				Regarding how long one can stay awake on adderall, I&#039;m kind of ashamed to admit this, but I did 7 days, one whole week awake.<br /><br />I&#039;m still alive. I think I may have permanently damaged myself but I&#039;m not completely burnt-out retarded yet.<br /><br />But it wasn&#039;t pretty.<br /><br />What&#039;s scary is that I was in the same scenario as you. Partying, needed to get caught up on coursework. Everything just got the best of me.<br /><br />By day seven I would be walking down the street. I&#039;d look down and see static, like on a TV channel hooked up to an antenna that isn&#039;t getting reception. Making fractal-like formations. I must have looked like a complete mess. I was picking at NOTHING all over my arms and was starting to develop scabs in various visible places on my body. One person thought they were track marks.<br /><br />For a long time after that I swore off adderall and meth. I felt shitty for days afterwards. The roof of my mouth burned when I tried to eat. I wanted to die.
