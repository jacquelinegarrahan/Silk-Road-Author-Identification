				Tough to say... I have zero tolerance to pot but when I smoke it on rare occasions (think a few times every few years), I can go through quite a bit of it. If you want it to last a week just part it up into a weeks worth of piles and that&#039;s how high you get to get. If you want to get high every night till you are high enough just smoke it till you feel good and deal with the fact that you&#039;ll probably run out. If you really want it to last you could look at getting a vaporizer but if you are buying a gram of pot at a time a $250 vaporizer might not be the most cost effective savings solution.

				1 gram, smoking till you get high daily would be between 5-7 days, and that&#039;s assuming 0 tolerance and not re-dosing (if that term is even applied to weed).

				Someone could stretch a gram ten days if they smoked by their selfs, and only smoked a point a day. I have found with weed that tolerance is raised and plateaus at a certain level for 12 hours before dropping. You know the saying. &quot;Once you smoked so much you can&#039;t get higher.&quot; I have found personally that i could get high again if i spread my sessions by 12 hours or 24 at best. (I believe this is why wake&#039;n bake woks so well besides being rested.) It could last even longer if they didn&#039;t smoke daily. Let us know how long you make it. You have me curious.
