				Hello good people. <br />Here I come again with questions...<br /><br />I new to psychedelics substances, have tried few different, but never mushrooms.<br /><br />So my question are:<br /><br />1. What is the normal dosage and what dose is too much?<br />2. How long does it last?<br />3. I have seen that there are different types of mushrooms. They have different effects and must be taken in different dosages?<br />4. Is it true that you may experience sickness in your stomach?<br />5. Any differences in eating them while on empty stomach or not?<br /><br />That would be all I want to ask right now.<br /><br />Thanks in advance and have a nice day/night<br /><br />Adamiz

				Stomach content has much to do with how soon your trip begins. <br />Nausea and or stomach discomfort, coupled with the possibility of vomiting and or diarrhea is not uncommon.<br />For the most part, cubensis is cubensis.<br />A trip will last any where from 4-12 hours depending on dose.<br />A light dose would be 1-3 grams, average dose 3-5grams, pro portions are 7grams or better, i dont suggest this unless your absolutely sure of what your getting your self into. Much love.

				Dear adamiz..<br /><br />Just talking from my own (few) experiences, expert psychonauts please correct me !<br /><br />1. If you have had experience with other psychedelics, 4-5 grams of dried cubensis should be an ok large dose. There is no &quot;too much&quot; as in what would do serious physical harm, i guess high doses will just get you into saturation and give you a longer trip.<br />2. Dried shrooms on empty stomach together with a hot drink will take 1/2 hour till effects start, fresh shrooms will take 1 hour. Then You will trip for 4-5 hours then the effects will fade during 2 more hours. The afterglow will probably last till next afternoon.<br />3. Species are Psilocybe Cubensis, P. Semilanceata, P. Cyanescens, P. Azurescens and Paneolus Cinctulus which have different amounts of alcaloids but for practical purposes you can treat them similar, just have to adapt dosage. You will find much info on shroomery or mycotopia. The strains of P. Cubensis, most of them are named by location, are roughly the same in strength. dirtybiscuitzz718&#039;s dosages are referring to cubensis, dried. So far, I have tried 3 different cubensis and semilanceata - I&#039;m now growing my own cyanescens which i&#039;m looking forward to harvest in autumn. For the first trips don&#039;t mix with anything. You can&#039;t combine them with anything &quot;2C-X&quot; (that&#039;s what DM Turner said) .. but you can combine them with harmine sources such as syrian rue seed, which will make trip sligthly stronger and enable you to shift planes more easily. I call that &quot;shaman flip&quot; or &quot;psilohuasca&quot;. <br />4. Some do get sick and it&#039;s better to vomit sooner than later, but this hasn&#039;t happened to me yet.<br />5. I recommend empty stomach especially at first time because it will make the trip shorter and stronger with the same dosage.<br /><br />...more to come...

				Possible example for a shroom session, if you do it on your own :<br /><br />- Be aware of your intention. Experimenting, having adventurous fun, gaining knowledge, talking to the gods, all those intentions are fine.<br />- Make sure you can&#039;t get disturbed during the next 5 hours. <br />- Create a sacred space in your preferred way. Make everything neat and tidy, set up an altar with some flowers, pictures of your favourite deity/guru/pop star/scientist - you get me... Have a place to lie down comfortably in that space. Set up the shrooms and a cup of hot herbal tea.<br />- Speak a prayer/invocation.<br />- Eat your shrooms, chew well, drink the tea in sips.<br />- Sing prayers,kirtans or whatever is your equivalent of an uplifting/spiritual song/poem. <br />- At some point you&#039;ll notice the shrooms will kick in very fast. Lie down comfortably and dive into the ocean of visions.<br />- Now is your time to explore.<br />- At some point the strength of visions will dimish. Say thanks to your guides, and take notes once you can.<br />- Eat easy&amp;refreshing food afterwards, fruit + yoghurt worked great for me.<br /><br />Love and Light~~~<br />

				After the first time I did mushrooms I started doing them twice a week at least for about 6-8 months. My essential tips...<br /><br />-I don&#039;t know about any of this meditation, sacred zone stuff, I never needed it but what is essential is that you are with(if you&#039;re with anyone) people you 100% know and trust. Strangers scare the shit out of me when I&#039;m tripping on mush, and if you have a guide with you(which is dead wicked if you have someone who can drive you around. If you can convince yourself to think of a car as a safe zone you can see so much cool shit without feeling too nervous)make sure they are someone who is 100% chill and won&#039;t fuck with you. I hate doing it around sober people who are just going to flick their hands at you and try trip you out and shit.<br /><br />-get a totem. I never even realized I did it until after I stopped doing mush all the time(I have stopped now because I can&#039;t do it without puking anymore and I need around 1/2 oz usually to get the high I desire) but one of the first things I do when my high comes on is grab a special looking rock or little toy or something. If I start to head in a bad direction on my trip I just sit down and say &quot;well at least I have my rock&quot; and then after looking at it for a while I just sit up and carry on and everything seems better.<br /><br />-If you live in an area where you can get access to a forest, field, or, if you live in a small town, empty streets late on a weeknight, try and enjoy the outdoors. Nothing compares to it.

				Thanks Churchwarden for your answer. I agree with you with being around sober people. I enjoy taking psychedelics mostly alone or with 1 or 2 really good friends.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184020.msg1340998#msg1340998">Quote from: Churchwarden on July 15, 2013, 09:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-If you live in an area where you can get access to a forest, field, or, if you live in a small town, empty streets late on a weeknight, try and enjoy the outdoors.
