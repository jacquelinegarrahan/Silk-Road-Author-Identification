				=======================<br />TRIP REPORT : 25I-NBOMe<br />=======================<br /><br />SUBSTANCE : 25I-NBOMe (non-HPBCD complexed)<br />DOSAGE : 1.5mg (2x 750ug blotter)<br />SOURCE : ENBOOM on SR<br /><br /><br />LOG<br />----------------<br />T-0:10 = 2:00 PM<br />Brushed teeth and gums in preparation for buccal application<br /><br />T+0:00 = 2:10 PM<br />Applied blotter between upper gums and top lip. Plan to hold in place for 30+ minutes, without swallowing.<br /><br />T+0:23 = 2:33 PM<br />Slight changes in perception. Really getting into the music. Minor visual perception changes are hard to explain - large chance that this is placebo at this point. Mouth full of saliva.<br /><br />T+0:30 = 2:40 PM<br />So much saliva. The effect to my sight can be compared to a low-dose tryptamine - my eyes are recognizing patterns more readily than usual. Slight glimmering on some surfaces/textures.&nbsp; Effects still quite mild.<br /><br />T+0:40 = 2:50 PM<br />Swallowed the saliva. Still holding blotter in place. Taste is mildly bitter. Slight jaw-clenching is becoming apparent. Moved the blotter to another spot on my gums - initial spot feels slightly numb.&nbsp; Slight warping is beginning to occur - most prevalent when looking at text.<br /><br />T+0:52 = 3:02 PM<br />Coming up now. Some jitters in my hands, and a bit of anxiety, but still what I&#039;d consider a &quot;low-anxiety&quot; comeup. Mild feelings of nausea.<br /><br />T+1:10 = 3:20 PM<br />Removing the blotter now. Pretty anxious at this point. Nothing new to report visually.<br /><br />T+1:20 = 3:30 PM<br />Drank some water, anxiety is subsiding. Slight halos and trails in vision. Very minimal. Some effect on speech and communication, but my mind is fully lucid and without confusion.<br /><br />T+1:32 = 3:42 PM<br />Wow - the marked difference in anxiety is astounding. I am feeling great now, very loose. The halos mentioned above are still present. Thinking about administering one more dose of 750ug.<br /><br />T+1:40 = 3:50 PM<br />Contemplating the second dose. On the computer, I&#039;m experiencing warping! Slow-period warbling of my surroundings, but only upon intimate inspection.<br /><br />T+1:50 = 4:00 PM<br />Second 750ug blotter applied. Still feeling great, and I hope to move the visual effects a little farther from baseline :D<br /><br />T+2:05 = 4:15 PM<br />Experiencing muscle jitters again, similar to those experienced earlier.&nbsp; Music appreciation is mildly elevated at this point. So much saliva again!<br /><br />T+3:34 = 5:44 PM<br />Just spent the last hour in Costco, shopping and observing. Held it together no problem. Shadows/Lights.. were like someone playing with a dimmer switch - colors were falling onto each other<br /><br />T+4:23 = 6:33 PM<br />Just got back from the beach, and it was one of the most beautiful experiences I&#039;ve ever had. Details are so sharp! Colors are so _____(colorful?)! There appears to be a geometric mesh just beyond the surface of everything, binding, defining, and comprising it. <br /><br />T+5:01 = 7:11 PM<br />Tears are flowing a lot - happens all the time with mushrooms for me. Feels great. Clean out the eye-plumbing. Watching a show about dolphins.<br /><br />T+5:35 = 7:45 PM<br />Coming down for sure now, pretty relaxed.<br /><br />T+6:31 = 8:41 PM<br />Had a bit of weed, comedown nothing out of the ordinary<br /><br />T+7:30 = 9:40 PM<br />Checking in - feel nearly back to baseline. Pupils still dilated.<br /><br />T+9:30 = 11:40 PM<br />Back at baseline.<br /><br />T+10:40 = 12:50 AM<br />Pupils no longer dilated. Ending the log here.<br /><br /><br />REPORT<br />----------------<br />Wow, this stuff is incredible! I tend to recommend 2C-I to inexperienced users of psychedelics due to it&#039;s easiness on the mind (little confusion/mindfuck), but 25I-NBOMe now takes the cake for my favorite &quot;light-hearted&quot; psychedelic. During the trip, I was having a bit of a hard time speaking (fumbling over my words), but my head was quite clear and lucid.&nbsp; I managed to spend part of the peak shopping in Costco with my trip-sitting buddy, and damn was it fun.&nbsp; However, where this substance really impressed me was outdoors at the beach. Colors and patterns are perceived in such a beautiful way - admittedly less &quot;deep&quot; than some psychedelics, but I was in awe of nature - able to inspect things down to incredible levels of detail. Colors were &quot;falling into each other&quot; - ever look at 3D footage without glasses? Where the red/blue images are slightly misaligned? It was similar to that, but much more complex and less predictable. The effects were quite nice!<br /><br />I was very pleased that there was very little body load at all - one of my main dislikes of the 2C-x family.&nbsp; I did experience slight muscle twitching, but again, much less than an &quot;equivalent&quot; (effects-wise) dose of 2C-I. There is certainly more to explore at higher doses, and I plan to employ the incremental-dose strategy again.<br /><br /><br />SUBJECT NOTES<br />----------------<br />WEIGHT : 180lbs<br />EXPERIENCE : 2C-I/2C-P/DMT/Mushrooms/4-Aco-DMT<br />TOLERANCE : Moderate strength DMT trip ~2 weeks ago - expect no effect to tolerance.

				Thank you for the detailed report. I&#039;ve been looking at some of the newer 25-nbom&#039;s for a new experience. I&#039;ve done many hits of acid, shrooms, and dmt in my day - but always looking for something that is the perfect combination of the 3 (in terms of duration, anxiety levels, and negative side effects).

				No, I haven&#039;t<br />I have, however, tried its 2C-x partner, 2C-C<br /><br />2C-C is a little more relaxes and forgiving than 2C-I, but honestly set/setting/mood has about equal effect in my opinion. Looking forward to 25C-NBOMe, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s similar in a lot of ways.

Tends to have more of a launch to it. New visual dimension of breathing walls, morphing textures etc.. while 25i for me was mostly color bleeds and enhanced edges etc.<br /><br />Another way to describe it... 25i you get a &#039;feel&#039; for a new plane of existence, 25c you &#039;see&#039; it.<br /><br />Yet another way to say it... 25c is the entertainer (visual and fun), while 25i is the deep and meaningful (revelations, realizations etc).<br /><br />If there was a trip that was all encompassing which hit you hard with visuals and mindfuck (shrooms, lsd maybe??), then I would say that 25c and 25i would each represent flip-sides of the coin. <br /><br />Oh yeah, all this is how it effects *me* personally, it may be different for you, although from what I see at bluelight, other people are reporting similar (and exact same) results.

				Very interesting LexusMiles!<br /><br />I&#039;d already consider 25I to be very light on the mindfuck, compared to other substances - seems like 25C would be a great beginner psych!
