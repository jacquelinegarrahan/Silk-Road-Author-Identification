				How are peoples experiences with this drug?<br /><br />Firstly, I have acute social anxiety and will be starting university in under a month, I have read that this drug is a derivative of MDMA but it&#039;s not as hard on the serotonin receptors and thus the neuro-toxicity is likely to not matter as your brain clears it up faster than it builds up to damage your axons (anyone with more knowledge on this care to chime in?)<br /><br />Secondly I read you can re-dose multiple times throughout the day and still feel the effects, there&#039;s no horrible MDMA comedown (probably due to the serotonin receptors not being bombarded as much? again, just a thought) and you can pretty much take it for weeks at a time with no ill effects, or at least, I haven&#039;t found any ill effects through google.<br /><br />As for my questions, I would like to know whether or not you sweat profusely on this like you do with MDMA, and whether or not you get the jaw clenching and dilated pupils - will people be able to tell I&#039;m on a drug if it&#039;s like I said, a low therapeutic dose?<br /><br />I was thinking of starting at 100mg and seeing where that gets me.<br /><br />I currently self-medicate with benzos for my anxiety but I&#039;m finding while they may make me calm, they don&#039;t make me want to do anything like socialize or talk to people - that&#039;s where the Methylone comes in.<br /><br />There seems to be very little information out there about this so I was hoping people could chime in with what they know and their experiences.<br /><br />According to another forum:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now on to the high itself. I wouldn&#039;t consider it a &quot;trip&quot; and it doesn&#039;t put you in a psychedelic mindset. I feel 100% normal but like all my inhibitions are gone. Zero anxiety. I walk out of the bathroom and literally talk to every single girl and guy that I see is standing/sitting alone. I&#039;m smiling, I&#039;m funny and charming, and I become &quot;alpha as fuck.&quot; It gives me the social skills of a salesman, and I see people as being beautiful and I see my &quot;purpose&quot; is to communicate with them and make sure they&#039;re doing good as well. I don&#039;t like taking methylone alone or at home. It&#039;s great but definitely something you need to take in a club or lounge.*<br /><br />* I don&#039;t normally go to clubs/raves/lounges. I only go on methylone. It lowers inhibitions and I become very physical, and it gives me energy to dance. I wouldn&#039;t think methylone is suitable in a more reserved and fancy setting, at least not in the dose I take and in the mindset I use methylone for.<br /><br />Oh and Methylone has absolved my social anxiety even after it wore off.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There&#039;s also this website which has some information (mostly positive):<br />http://www.methylone.com/experiences/<br /><br />I&#039;m actually finding more positives than negatives with this drug, why isn&#039;t it more widespread? It seems like a wonder drug.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24922.msg264758#msg264758<br /><br />This is my trip report for M1.<br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting drug. For those who haven&#039;t tried it - please do! It&#039;s worth the price. It gave me a unique feeling that no other drug has come close to. I felt like my soul had been given Meth. I felt amazing, not the most euphoric of drugs, but the feeling you get from it is amazing.<br /><br />I still prefer Mephedrone, but Methylone is still a good 8/10

				methylone gives me worst comedowns. week of bleakest depression. and i&#039;m not the only one experiencing this from people I know. mdma comedown is a joke to me compared to what methylone gives. mdma just makes me sad afterwards, but couple of joints, a good walk and i&#039;m good as new. it might be the batch i had, but the whole &quot;it&#039;s like extasy, but you can roll daily!&quot; thing seems not entirely true to me.

				That&#039;s funny because M1 gives me the best afterglows. Could have been the batch mate, M1 releases LESS serotonin than MDMA. Therefore one would assume the comedowns would be less intense (if any at all). <br />

				I rolled on MDMA the other night, the next day I wanted to shoot myself and never take drugs again, i&#039;m 95% fine now, but it just goes to show that everyone&#039;s bodies can react differently to different chemicals. I will report on my Methylone experience when I try it, but as I said i&#039;m not taking it to &#039;roll&#039; like most people would, just to use as &quot;chemical therapy&quot; to coin a phrase.

				I&#039;m curious to try M1 but I used to suffer bad comedowns from MDMA so I should probably stay away, even though it&#039;s supposedly easier on your brain.

				very nice roll. short lived. different effects on different people. some complain of the 3-6 hours comedown where heart is beating very hard though not rapidly. i believe most people do not report this however. tolerance builds extremely slowly. wonderfully priced. horrible pain when insuffalated. next day there&#039;s hardly any residual effects.

				Methylone has actually become my drug of choice over the last few months.<br /><br />My favorite route is IV. It depends on the batch, but 70 - 100mg will be very intense. I dissolve it in 1.5ml of sterile water (it dissolves easily) and then I filter that through a .2 micron wheel filter. The rush you get is unlike anything I&#039;ve experienced IV before. It&#039;s very intense, and if it&#039;s something you think you might want to try, start off with 40mg or so.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even compare it to MDMA. Feels totally different to me

				First, sorry for my poor English.<br />I want to put a trip report about Nevita&#039;s m1.<br />This is my trip report from Nevita&#039;s thread:<br /><br />This was definitely not my first time with methylone, but this trip was the deepest one. Usually m1 is good for clubbing, listening to the UK-Garage and other stuff like that. But this trip was completely different.<br />My friend just broke up with his girlfriend, so I wanted to cheer him up. So I gave him a small amount of m1 (150 mg - it was his first time with this drug).<br />And we started to talk. He is a very smart person and a good interlocutor. The mind was absolutely clear, and it was very easy to recall anything, and to analyze things. We discussed a wide range of things - from human behavior and personality development to regression analysis and other different things.<br />Some hours later we took some more m1 and continued our conversation.<br />The whole conversation took 10 (!) hours. This was definitely one of the greatest days in my life. This day changed my personality and gave me a lot of thoughts how to improve my life. He also was very impressed - he waited for something like Human Traffic stuff :)

Obviously it would be ignorant of me to say drugs are all good. Yes, like anything, they can be dangerous... but isn&#039;t life itself dangerous? I could get run over tomorrow, stabbed or shot. I&#039;m doing evening classes and have to walk home when it&#039;s dark (haven&#039;t got a car), this itself is dangerous to a degree. There&#039;s more of a chance of me getting hurt on my way home than I am taking some MDMA.<br /><br />As much as I love my booze, that itself is dangerous. It&#039;s addictive, damaging to the liver, and is quite easy to OD on. But there&#039;s so much money made from it, same with fags. You get these people drinking their Coffee, smoking their Fags and yet look down on say Heroin addicts. Well, aren&#039;t you addicticted to Caffeine and Nicotine?? You have an addiction, the only difference is that YOUR addiction isn&#039;t frowned upon.<br /><br />I was watching a program the other weeks, with journalists saying addicts only do drugs because they&#039;re pleasurable and they still be punished for possession. IMO doing people for possession is unreasonable. It&#039;s THEIR body, they can put in it what the fuck they want. Ok, if they are an addict and its getting out of hand (Stealing from people etc) they should be treated as a PATIENT, and helped to get off the gear NOT punished. <br /><br />Ahhh, I could go on about this all day. I can&#039;t change jack shit... But I&#039;m more than entitled to my opinion.<br /><br />EDIT - <br /><br />Oh and try M1, it&#039;s great! Not as good as Drone but it&#039;s still nice. Or if you want the ultimate experience, do a Mephedrone + M1 combo. The comedown isn&#039;t too bad. But some people are more prone to them. I don&#039;t get comedowns from MD, well not horrible ones. I feel a little more tired and lethargic the next day. (Can&#039;t eat much either). But I still feel OK. M1 gives me an afterglow... an amazing one! And Drone gives me no comedown pretty much. I feel a little tired (Though this will most likely be a lack of sleep).
