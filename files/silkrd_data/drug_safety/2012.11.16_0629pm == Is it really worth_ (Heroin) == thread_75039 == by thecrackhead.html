				Hello guys,<br />I&#039;m just wondering if in the long run being a heroin addict is worth...I&#039;ve done my research and it seems that in 90% of the cases people are getting weaker and weaker, day by day. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br />I am not new to drugs. however I&#039;ve never been addicted to a substance and I did quite a few of them, also for long periods. (cocaine, mephedrone, lsd, nbome, weed, 2c-b, special k, meth, ampethamine, shrooms mdma xtc etc). I&#039;m the kind of &quot;test your drugs on me&quot; guy. I managed to stay away from H so far but I am sure that H has its beauty just like any other drug.<br /><br /><br />There is this thought that keeps bothering me and keeps pushing me to order some H...<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit confused

				I&#039;ve never done Heroin but I was on morphine for an extended period of time in the hospital and it was wonderful. I still find myself thinking about how enjoyable it was even though it was 2yrs ago. I imagine heroin is the same.<br /><br />But I doubt your real question was whether opium is enjoyable. It&#039;s whether long-term addiction is worth it? Eh that&#039;s a tough question. <br /><br />You probably already know this so like the person above said... don&#039;t inject and try to moderate. Don&#039;t let it interfere with other peoples lives. Use good judgement. Etc, etc.<br /><br />Also, read this book:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Midnight-Memoir-Jerry-Stahl/dp/0976082209/<br /><br />It&#039;s about a guy who managed a functional heroin addiction while being a writer in hollywood. It&#039;s brilliant.

				No3 is freebase for smoking/snorting. No4 is a salt and for snorting or IV only. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried heroin 4-5 times - bought a quarter gram from SR just to see what the deal is. It was nice, but nothing like the euphoria I had heard of. It was relaxing and extremely comforting.<br /><br />In my experience true addiction comes much later with opiates than with stimulants. Stimulants have the immediate &quot;need mooooore&quot; cravings whereas I never found myself craving heroin. It didn&#039;t give me what I want from a drug - soaring euphoria like with meth. <br /><br />Anyway, my point is that addiction to the stuff isn&#039;t definite. It depends a lot on you as a person and what you are looking for in a drug. But if you have issues and are looking for a way to escape, heroin is possibly the most powerful &quot;escape drug&quot;. In this case it&#039;s hard to imagine a scenario where the user doesn&#039;t become addicted.<br /><br />Trying the drug was worth it, just as an experience. Won&#039;t try it again though. Look at your reasons for wanting to try it before making a purchase.

				If you&#039;re intentionally looking to be an addict, no, don&#039;t try it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just looking to experience it to say you&#039;ve tried it, then go for it.&nbsp; Ordering from SR puts up more boundaries when it comes to addiction matters, because of all the extra steps involved in acquiring drugs here.&nbsp; Since I found SR I never thought I&#039;d try a lot of things out there, but here I am trying them all.&nbsp; I was quite surprised to see I was overly worried about much of nothing.<br /><br />The worst thing I&#039;ve tried to date is coke, snorted...I&#039;ve never fiended for ANYTHING in my life that hard, and eventually I just decided I can&#039;t control the cravings, so hey:&nbsp; no more buying coke!&nbsp; Problem solved.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to do the same thing with H here, get a small (very small, trust me, you don&#039;t want large quantities of anything addictive even being in the same house as you) order and go for it.&nbsp; If that supply is gone in a week, or too soon for your comfort zone, just don&#039;t buy more.&nbsp; You can cut off highly addictive drugs before they get a hold on you, and just DONT buy more.&nbsp; It&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; Cherish your fun experiences while they&#039;re fun, once they start becoming a drag on your soul, you&#039;re starting to get too deep, but not deep enough you can&#039;t pull out of it before you fall.&nbsp; But most importantly if you can look back on an experience as positive overall, then it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />A friend of mine tried heroin for a couple months and then quit right out, but they also didn&#039;t abuse it enough that it gave them anything more than a mild withdrawal period, which was enough for them to end contact with the substance.&nbsp; Same friend is basically saying the same thing I&#039;m echoing to you:&nbsp; &quot;Try everything you can while you&#039;re alive, skydive, climb mountains, try every drug under the sun, just don&#039;t become a slave to anyone or anything.&quot;<br /><br />Good luck.

				Thank you for your positive&amp;informative answers I&#039;ve decided to give #3 a go. I will order small just for the effects. I&#039;m not planning to go for IV as it will probably ruin what I stand for.<br /><br />Once again thank you and I appreciate.

				So i had a guy i knew IRL who could pick up stamp bags.&nbsp; I never wanted to try heroin but one night he couldn&#039;t get any blow, which was the plan for the night, so i decided to give some of his H a try.... I&#039;m not gonna lie, the feeling was awesome, snorted a .2 thinking it was like coke even after he warned me not to... lets just say i dry heaved for about 15 min... almost fell down cuz i could barely stand... finally sat down and struggled to stay awake just to enjoy the overwhelming feeling...&nbsp; i finally gave in and went to sleep only to wake the next day feeling like a million bucks...<br /><br />I stayed away from the shit for about 2+ years.&nbsp; At which point i found a new guy... at first i just wanted to do it once again but i found myself picking up every weekend... before i knew it i was about to throw down on a jab...I never felt any withdraws at this point because i would only do it on the weekends, but I definitely wasn&#039;t gonna stop picking up any time soon.... it just so happened that that weekend when my guy was picking up the jab he got busted and went to jail...<br /><br />In reflection to that i saw that i had not just done it 1x again, but instead started a weekly habit of getting that feeling... i thank fate for everything that happened, obviously i wasn&#039;t happy my guy got locked up, but i just think of what path i would have gone down if i kept picking up each week, if i got that jab and blew through 12 bags in the night ? who knows... but i will say this, i still search the heroin listings on SR every once in a while... just contemplating my next rush...

				Personally not worth trying at all as the bads by far outweigh the good. IV&#039;ing for the &#039;rush&#039; everyone talks about which imo is a bit extreme for first time and all other methods are great but no rush, just nods. One guy described it perfectly on his first time on a thread by Rauol Duke recently I think. Was something like &#039;why would anyone wanna take a drug that makes you itch, sweat and not be able to piss (not exact words but close enough)&#039;. Quite funny as when beginning, that&#039;s exactly what happened to me. It&#039;s a really weird thing as first time snorting for example, I liked it but not LOVED it...just became curious to keep trying more (was in a source country) and then one day was real sick when didn&#039;t take. It&#039;s a slow and very painful spiral...Withdrawal sucks soooooooooo bad!! <br /><br />However, you&#039;ve bought it now (could always flush it lol) so use safely. As always the mantra &#039; can always take more, but never less&#039; applies big time to strong opiates! If bought no 4 and incredibly pure with no tolerance at all - seriously a match head sized bump will do just fine. Very easy to go too far or OD if take a big sized line with no tolerance for example. I personally woulda tried oxy or something first as guaranteed purity and with oxy, small bumps lift you very nicely, with bigger bumps for great nod (unless u have experience with other opiates). Smoking brown first time will most likely make you puke your guts out but can be a good thing as puts some peeps off. All depends on addictive character or not. Either way, be safe and enjoy your experience!! it can be amazing + shit, mostly both at the same time&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve been tempted to try H for a long while, but honestly my opiate tolerance is low enough that a 5mg percocet can get me feeling damn good after a week or two of being off opiates. So I think H would be a little strong for me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard the rush isn&#039;t that great if you don&#039;;t IV it... I personally would never IV anything... i don&#039;t like needles. And the best rush i&#039;ve ever had was from XTC and real good coke... so i&#039;m happy with that kinda rush rather than IV&#039;g some H.<br /><br />Good luck to you, be careful, and make sure to start off real slow!

				imho<br /><br />The high: Great nothing like it (except other opiates but this is one of the best). If picked up only once in a great while (1 month min., screw that 4 days to a week shit): it makes for a great experience. Good for pain. Good for a relaxing weekend. Relatively small detection time in urine.<br /><br />The low: Hard to use just once. Tolerance builds fast. Addiction is a life destroyer. OD is a problem. Expensive.<br /><br />Just my 2 bits.

				It just makes it really easy to fuck up your life. It always starts out fine, the honeymoon period on H gives everyone the impression they can handle it.

Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br />I am not new to drugs. however I&#039;ve never been addicted to a substance and I did quite a few of them, also for long periods. (cocaine, mephedrone, lsd, nbome, weed, 2c-b, special k, meth, ampethamine, shrooms mdma xtc etc). I&#039;m the kind of &quot;test your drugs on me&quot; guy. I managed to stay away from H so far but I am sure that H has its beauty just like any other drug.<br /><br /><br />There is this thought that keeps bothering me and keeps pushing me to order some H...<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit confused<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Let me put it this way to you dude, Does being a &quot;Junkie&quot; sound &quot;worth it&quot; to you? <br />Naw, fuck that shit. lol

				opiates eventually win.&nbsp; They are the greatest, most horrible, wonderful, painful, blissful, destructive things god gave us.&nbsp; I noticed in your list of things you have tried, I did not see pain meds?&nbsp; Try some loratab, try some oxy, heroin is usually last stop on that train not the first.&nbsp; Its not a glamorous drug, the opiates always become a necessity.&nbsp; Just to be what I was before I started I have to have X amount daily.&nbsp; Its a personal choice, but by default I should tell you no don&#039;t do it.&nbsp;
