				In short, 100mg of brown or tan MDMA is, from what I understand, only 84 actual mg of pure MDMA. Where as if its been washed, 100mg is actually 100mg pure MDMA.

				People wash molly to remove impurities.&nbsp; Yes, washing usually improves the appearance by making the product whiter, but it also removes known and unknown impurities, including reactants/precursor chemicals.&nbsp; Most people would prefer not to ingest extra chemicals, especially unknown ones or ones that are known to be toxic -- at the end of the day, that&#039;s what it comes down to.&nbsp; So it&#039;s more that just making the product prettier.

Washing it just gets rid of the extra stuff left on during the syth process. Most of it is benign, washing it also gets rid of a bit of the MDMA. No real reason to wash unless you are a clean freak. White does not mean it&#039;s purer either. MDMA is a salt, it recrystallizes easily with lots of other fillers. So going to buy the clean white / clear MDMA is as good as buying brown / tan.

				Ok - so washing isn&#039;t that much important with MDMA (less than with other products where it&#039;s well known that &quot;cutting&quot; has been added), but in case you want to clean your MDMA anyway, <br />what would be the best way to do such? <br />Just curious...

MDMA hydrochloride is the stuff we all know and love and in it&#039;s purest form 16% of the molecular weight is taken up by the hydrochloride. So if you wash and wash and wash you drug removing everything that is not MDMA hydrochloride you&#039;ll still have 16% of the weight by volume taken up by the hydrochloride. The people selling 84% pure MDMA are actually selling 100% pure MDMA hydrochloride assuming their advertising is correct which I really doubt it is a lot of the times.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the process is for converting it to freebase but in general salts are great since they last so long, can be pressed into pills, don&#039;t react with air and all that good stuff.<br /><br />Hope that helps, no chemist here either, but I was confounded by the 84% pure thing a while back and so tried to figure it all out. The only way to get 100% MDMA is to convert it into freebase, if it is a crystal, it&#039;s a salt and that salt takes up an exact amount of weight by volume.

				My old source used to wash his MDMA, and told me that it makes for a smoother, less nauseous com up than unwashed. I am not sure if that&#039;s true, but I did notice a difference.
