				Hi,<br /><br />What is the best way to store LSD, just the usual cool, dry and dark place? I was thinking of putting it in a book and closing the book, maybe wrap it up in some cling wrap?

				Keeping it away from light is the most important, I believe. I would wrap it in foil and put it in the freezer. I read once about a 50 year old vial of Sandoz LSD that had still not lost potency. It had been stored in a freezer for all that time.

				Not sure about tabs, but I once left an LSD-dosed sugar cube wrapped in foil and in a drawer for several months. By the time I had a chance to trip, it had lost its potency and was very weak - hardly any visuals or euphoria. A total waste.<br /><br />I remember reading somewhere that foil is bad for storing acid.<br /><br />There are also debates as to whether fridge or freezer is better. Some people say that the freezer can cause liquid to get on the blotter tabs, which is supposed to be bad.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help, it&#039;s because I generally find it difficult to store anything for very long, hah!

				Oxygen and Light are the 2 biggest enemies of LSD.&nbsp; Keep em wrapped up in a plastic bag or 2 and then some foil wrapped around that.&nbsp; The freezer would be bad only if you have a defrosting problem....otherwise cool dark place out of the surrounding air.

				I am going to run a little test on a some good tabs I have. I&#039;ll put a few away ziplocked/wrapped in foil and try them in a few months. I&#039;ve always been curious about how long you can keep acid for.<br /><br />
