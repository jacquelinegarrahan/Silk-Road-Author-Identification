				Talking .6 mg upwards.<br /><br />Would like to provoke some deep psychological change... kinda stuck in some areas of my life, want to move to the next level.<br /><br />Did something in the area of 200 mcg last weekend, was some okay tripping, but didn&#039;t change my outlook a bit.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t taken many drugs over the course of my life, so im not jumping from drug to drug looking for salvation.

				I don&#039;t know man, I&#039;ve always said screw the heroic dose shit.<br /><br />I respect my psychedelics and do safe/low doses. Always a good time for me.<br /><br />The only reason Mckenna used to take such high doses is because his tolerence was sky high.

				Acid is a tool not a miracle cure. It won&#039;t do all the work for you of changing your outlook or ways. It works way better when you are already putting serious effort into unsticking yourself.<br />Set and setting has long been known plays a huge part in the experience - set being the mindset with which you approach the trip. <br /><br />Additionally there is no guarantee that such an experience will be at all pleasurable. You never know what comes up and if the life situation you are trying to unstick is a severe situation or condtion chances are that much higher to run into seriously disturbing stuff or triggering an even more severe condition.<br /><br />That said the really transformative experiences do usually occur on stronger dosages of 300ug - 500ug and frequently not until one has several trips under the belt. It is not uncommon that it takes some trips before one is able to allow oneself to surrender to the experience. <br /><br />Only few users have the gods talking to them, dissolve their personality or merge with the universe until after 5 - 10 trips. Patience, determination and large doses will get most there.<br />

I would bet some serious cash on the point that if you&#039;re really hoping to make some serious changes in your life, it&#039;s not going to be all nice and fluffy. change comes from little steps, and from facing your resistance, usually attachment i.e. pain!<br />all peace and love and all that, but trips don&#039;t change you unless you implement the changes yourself, in your daily life

				The most LSD I&#039;ve ingested was 1.5 milligrams, and it didn&#039;t induce a life-changing experience.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy the hype that you need insane amounts of LSD to experience something extraordinary.&nbsp; I may sound trite, but it&#039;s all about set and setting.

				The life changing experiences i had on lsd all were on doses around 200-400 ug. I&#039;ve tried doses up to 700-800 ug, but i find that what is experienced on those higher doses is sooo far out, it can&#039;t be translated to anything useful in daily life. Of course the very weird things one can experience on high doses have their own value, but I get more confused and easier to freak out on high doses, so I don&#039;t do it too often.<br /><br />And as already mentioned, as I find also, when one has more trip experiences, it becomes easier to have &#039;mystical&#039; experiences.<br /><br />If you do want to take a high dose, I would recommend to have a trip sitter and some benzo&#039;s at hand!

				YES, set and setting. <br />Sounds like a project for MDMA (and maybe another person or two). Timothy Leary and many others sure believed in LSD (you want a GREAT read on LSD read &#039;Storming Heaven&#039;-LSD and the American Dream&#039;. It&#039;s got 39 reviews on Amazon and a perfect 5)<br />I&#039;d suggest reading. When I was in my 20&#039;s I had a long bout of depression. I came across this book &#039;The Denial of Death&#039; by Ernest Becker and I read it at the right time for me. Probably get it really cheap used on Amazon too. <br /><br />Shulgin even talks a lot about set and setting in PIKAL and that guy was an objective observer as anybody around.

				thanks to all of you.<br /><br />http://www.ebook3000.com/Storming-Heaven--LSD-and-the-American-Dream_115883.html<br /><br />i think books like this should be bought to support the author. but if you want to take a quick look or cant get it offline try the link. you can of course get it online. but i advice against that.<br /><br />stay safe all of you!

				It isn&#039;t the dose, it is the set and setting. Also think about having a guide there to help you through the process to tackle what you want to change.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic/dp/1594774021<br /><br />Talks about the best way to use LSD as a tool.

For me 200-300µ should be very strong, I don&#039;t know exactly because I only had 2 LSD experiences (not long ago) and both were with heavy mixing of drugs that I think worked against the LSD very much. I ate 4 that night (460µg but over a long time in small doses) the effect was strong but not what I would expect from 4 blotters. That&#039;s of course a little weird to say because I don&#039;t know the strength of 4 blotters with mono consumption so I have no reference really.)

				Where would you think LSD starts to get a drug that really needs a sitter? 360µg still safe for coordination and walking path&#039;s that you walked thousands of times and can walk them with eyes closed and even fast without hitting anything?

So if I took 20 or if I took 100 -it would have the same effect. I sold some to other people and this stuff was potent enough that one dose would be a good time -if you were at a concert or something. <br />
