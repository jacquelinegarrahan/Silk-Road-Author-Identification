				Has anyone else ever had these exact pills...the 30 MG adderall IR with AD on one side and 30 on the other?<br /><br />Pink round pill, with AD on one side and 30 on the other side.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; a score line for breaking the pill in half in between the 3 and the 0, and also&nbsp; two small scores markings right outside the 30.<br /><br />It looks pretty much identical to these ***clearnet pictures****&nbsp; Only issue I am finding is the color seems off. Mine are pink, but these seem orange, to pinkish orange....<br /><br />http://www.drugs.com/imprints/ad-30-1123.html<br />http://images.ddccdn.com/images/pills/mmx/t101133f/adderall.jpg<br />http://www.walgreens.com//images/drug/0100555076802.jpg<br /><br />The tabs in the photos&nbsp; were manufactured with those markings by Shire until 2010, then Teva took over.&nbsp; In the descriptions on the clearnet it says they are orange or peach to peach/orange.&nbsp; These pills I have are not really orange, but a very light pink.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;If anyone can help me out...please let me know if they have ever had Shire or Teva 30 mg IR Adderall or generic Adderall with these exact markings and a distinctly pink, and only very slightly peach color.&nbsp; That would be really helpful.&nbsp; It is hard to judge color properly over the internet using stock photos from websites.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I have taken that brand before, they kind of sucked, Teva makes a pretty shitty generic adderall =/ I think they were kinda orange in color.<br /><br />It does seem that exact pill has been counterfeited though: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm306041.htm<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how to tell if its a counterfeit though, it depends a lot on where you got it from.<br /><br />

				It really depends on the manufacturer as well as the dose.&nbsp; My current pills are peach/orange, but I&#039;ve had blue, pink, and even green pills of various shapes before (direct from the pharmacy, not SR/street). <br /><br />sdesu
