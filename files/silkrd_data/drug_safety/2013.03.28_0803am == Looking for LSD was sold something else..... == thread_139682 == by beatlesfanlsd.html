				So as the title says I bought &quot;acid&quot; off a kid being told it was lsd. It was on blotter and when I put it in my mouth it was SUPER bitter and chem tasting. In 15-20 minutes it was hitting me pretty hard and my ENTIRE mouth was numb, not just where the blotter was. I had SUPER intense visuals with geometric fractals and patterns. I was seeing what looked like pant zippers floating around 6 inches from my eyes in pinks and greens and yellows breaking apart and zipping back up. Of course I was like this is not fuckign LSD. But holy fuck did i laugh my ass off at everything while i was on it. Ive never laughed so hard in my life and stupid things (watched Adventure Time). I have no idea what it was but after narrowing it down I know it is from the 2cx family(i think) and I am pretty sure it was 25c nbome from other trip reports i have read. I have some 25i nbome which is lightly bitter and has a way slow come up. It is not this. I just want to chase this chem down and buy more for the summer. The visuals were way harder than LSD. Really strong shroom level visuals. Oh yeah and the trip was super abrupt come up and super abrupt come down. I think the last time i did it lasted about 4-4.5 hours? I was looking at a single tree and it looked like an entire fuckign jungle and the branches and leaves were snakes/fractals and NOTHING was NOT moving. What was it????????????? Thanks for your help :)

				also i realized that part of the reason it was so bitter was that it was probably complexed. HBCP or whatever.

				My vote goes to 25c NBOME. The quick come up, insane visuals and quick come down is the key.<br /><br />

				I had some HPBCD complexed 25c-NBOMe a while ago, but the come-up was around 40 minutes for me and the visuals were never really intense, even around a 1mg dose. You&#039;ve definitely been sold an NBOME, and as someone already said, 25d sounds about right.<br />Just my 2 cents.<br />- JH

If you take enough of a dose to get intense visuals, you&#039;ll trip for 8-12 hours. 25B also lasts longer than 4 hours for most people, and is thought to be less visual than 25I. Unless you somehow got one of the few batches of 25E-NBOMe, 25H-NBOMe, or 25N-NBOMe the only commonly found NBOMe with intense visuals and a 4 hour duration is 25D.<br />

				I&#039;ve had this happen before, but it was sugar cubes and I was getting noticeable first alerts within 12 minutes.&nbsp; Others said they were getting first alerts by the time the cubes finished dissolving in their mouths.<br /><br />I had some TERRIBLE after effects for the following 2 or&nbsp; 3 months!
