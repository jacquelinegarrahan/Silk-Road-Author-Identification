Dope makes you sociable but its, well its more dopey and if its good its like too strong and rocks your world and you end up dope sick the next day, Fuck that shit, aint no hangovers with scrip Hydro and Oxy COD, and like has been said street heroin can ranges from 2% purity to 98% purity. The lower end you probably want a refund the higher end you OD and die, and you don&#039;t really have any idea beforehand. FUn.&nbsp; Blues are 30 milligrams of oxycodone every goddamn time, and dope is just more gnarly period.

				agree with apples, after injecting heroin, oral administration of any drug just makes me fiend for intravenous heroin or morphine.<br />lets also keep in mind a lot of the prescription painkillers can be more harmful to your health with all the acetaminophen that passes through your liver. on the other hand, black tar can have some nasty adulterants that are even worse for your body than acetaminophen. if you want to really get fucked up, cold shooting china white heroin is the highest you can get and also the safest you can get as long as you use sterile equipment and you bought the shit from a reputable source. IV morphine is also very safe but not quite as euphoric as heroin. personally the prescription pain pills make me much more nauseous than IV heroin and morphine. not sure if this is an effect of the drug or an effect of the route of administration. i suspect it is due to the RoA, because 5 vicodin makes me wanna throw up but doesn&#039;t get me even 10% as high as a shot of heroin. as a result, pain pills are a really inefficient way of getting a dope high because you can&#039;t even crush it up and inject it - the binders can be really harmful.

				oxycodone (con): for a small percentage of users (i&#039;ve probally talked to like 15-20 of them on the internet and a few irl so there has to be more. this is including myself btw) stop having any recreational/painkilling effect from the drug (most of these permanently). only the negative effects (nausea/respritory depression/ etc) manifest. i think it&#039;s partially a mechanism of tolerance and maybe the structure of the drug. i&#039;m not sure. i probally sound like an idiot but whatever.<br /><br />not really a 100% con though. just kinda a weird anomaly i guess

I don&#039;t plan to. I watched my coke dealer friend go off the deep end and it&#039;s messed with me a lot. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s interesting how much consensus there is around the productive/energetic/&#039;amphet like&#039; characteristics of the oxycodone high. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to believe the substance has that kind of quality to it. But like clockwork almost every time I take it (that I&#039;ve eaten/slept correctly the nights before) I get an energetic high. Hydrocodone? Drowsier. Hydromorphone Doped. Morphine super drowsy. <br />Oxymorphone has an even greater energetic effect on me. BossHogg hooked it up really awesome one time on some oxymorphone and I found myself losing time

				For me CODONE is energetic although oxy more than hydro yes, and anything MORPHONE including morphine and H is more sedating and dopey. Although MORPHONE is stronger I prefer CODONE by far, not even close for me. I&#039;d rather have a grip of Vidocin than an equivalent amount of Dilaudid any day.

				Not having tried heroin, I can&#039;t say for sure.&nbsp; But personal preferences often have more to do with subjective effects rather than potency.&nbsp; Some like the sedating nod of heroin while others prefer the &quot;up&quot; high of oxy.&nbsp; Heroin is SUPPOSED to be the &quot;king of opiates&quot;, but plenty of oxy lovers would take OC over heroin every time if price weren&#039;t an issue.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Browsing the SR page I was immediately struck by how cheap heroin is in comparison to Oxy (and prescription pills in general).&nbsp; Not sure why pills are so expensive when many are generic versions that cost pennies per dose at the pharmacy.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done, sold and tried them all. Here&#039;s how I would Rank:<br />1. Heroin-Best high of them all and best Value w great legs<br />2. Opana (Oxymorphone). Great legs, ranks w/Heroin, but Difficult to get Prescribed, find and Expensive<br />3. Oxycodone ( OC&#039;s used be fav, but now 30mg Roxy&#039;s) easy to get and have Prescribed. Affordable<br />4. Hydrocodone,&nbsp; e.g.Vikes.

I guess...<br /><br />But I agree with your post wholeheartedly, Heroin is the strongest, but in my opinion Oxycodone is soo much better in every way, including that its not overwhelmingly strong and doesn&#039;t cause a shitty hangover but in fact none at all. Also you know exactly how much you are taking every time without exception, great for drug users with anxiety and know how common we are. Street Heroin ranges in purity from 2% to 98%. That is literally the reason people OD on H fairly often. People who OD on percs n shit are people who are trying to commit suicide basically, or the mixed alcohol or other shit.<br /><br />Also&nbsp; the energy, when I run out of my Rx Vyvanse, I can grab a blue or two and power through whatever I need to get done for a couple days, works just as well.

				I love them both. back in the day i would trade my own mother for a stamp bag or an 80 but they equally led me to the darkest point in my life and made me lose everything i have. i have been clean for about a year and now own my own house and have an extremely high paying job. i went from robbing my parents for money and feeling like shit all the time to being on top of the world. sorry for the rant but it just makes me cringe to think about. all i do now is use suboxone sometimes and im happy.&nbsp; but if you can use either of these drugs recreationally, more power to you!

				Yeah its always good to reniforce ^that kind of story, since it is all too common. I have done a suprisingly good job using it like a couple times a week for the past few months (I have had 3 surgeries where afteward I would be on PKs 24/7 for a while). I think its because WD scares me shitless, and that anxiety is enough to allow me to take a break once I notice that physical dependence starting to creep in.

Not until recently have I failed to get high/pain-relief (inseperable) from 15mg of Oxy or Hydrocodone.&nbsp; And I had only once blown Oxy over those several years, even when after surgery I had a script for 80 Oxy 5mg HCLs (no tylenol or anyhting else) with two refills. But in the past couple months I have sniffed H once and sniffed roxie quite a few times, they&#039;re so fuckin expensive on the street I feel its a little more bang for your buck,&nbsp; and my tolerance has gone up, which is why I am taking an extended break starting now. I still say just eating them (swallowing or chewing a bit if XR) is easily the best ROA (90% bio-availability) as well as the least addictive.

				So I respect you guys for deciding not to try heroin and sticking to it but how can you come on here and say Oxy is better?&nbsp; I think Oxy sucks serious balls when compared with H.&nbsp; I like the H euphoria so much better and its not like H is any worse for you.

From everything I have read and heard from folks who use it, your tolly goes through the roof, you start using it by IV&#039;ing and the addictive nature catches up with you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I know that Oxy has the same dangers. In my personal experience, I have been able to avoid those pitfalls.&nbsp; The squeeze ain&#039;t worth the juice is what I am trying to say.
