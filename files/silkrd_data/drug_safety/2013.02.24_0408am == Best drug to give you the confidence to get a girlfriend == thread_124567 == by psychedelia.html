				For those of us utterly lacking in self-confidence.<br /><br />Before killing myself, I want to know what it is like to have sex with someone.&nbsp; I don&#039;t give a shit about my brain any more, so I&#039;m willing to try any drug.

				Don&#039;t talk about killing yourself man it just isn&#039;t neccessary. Whatever sucks will probably get better. In my opinion what gives you the best confidence to get a girl, and also wont have people wondering what you&#039;re on would be the right amount of alcohol or coke, dont get shit faced drunk but get a good buzz an you will be willing to talk to anyone. Personally I have had more sex drunk than sober, especially because the other person is usually drunk, social, and horny also.<br /><br />Personally, I love MDMA way more than pussy. When I go to parties most peoples goal is to get laid, mine is to get fucked up and if I get pussy in the process that&#039;s cool to.<br />

				most stimulants will do the trick.<br /><br />the key though, is remembering the state of mind and then leveraging it in sobriety. Using drugs as a social crutch is a big issue with many people. Lots of people in the MDxx, coke, etc scene are guilty of it and I know I was. I don&#039;t abuse drugs anymore and my ex actually said to me the other day &quot;I liked you better when you were on drugs&quot; .... lol. Just remember there is a tradeoff and beware of using a substance to mask things you need to work on without narcotics.

				I know it&#039;s not the answer you want to hear, but I think if you are in this position drugs aren&#039;t going to help a great deal. Drug confidence is not real confidence and I find usually at some point before actually getting laid your inner insecurities will show though.<br /><br />I&#039;m not just talking out of my arse here - when I was 20 I was a virgin and had never even kissed a girl. I decided to change it and succeeded in a big way. At 25 I now get regular sex with many different girls. My body shape/looks have not changed and I don&#039;t have cash to throw around. I often go out to pick up on drugs, and without them. I&#039;ve actually noticed I do better without them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a short cut - you&#039;re going to have to go through some tough times and set outside your comfort zone to improve. Starting at the beginning and just forcing yourself to make conversation with hot girls at first its shit scary but over time you&#039;re going to get comfortable with that and then you can move up to getting more sexual. It&#039;s a slow process and 95% of people don&#039;t want the end result enough to commit and stick with it. It&#039;s taken me 4 years of getting rejected constantly to get to the point where I&#039;m sleeping with multiple different girls some weeks.<br /><br />If you want a short cut the only one I know of is a hooker, or possibly just standing by the door at the club and following all the fucked up girls out as they get kick out....I&#039;d hardly recommend either.<br /><br />Having said all of this some drugs can help in certain ways. MDMA/Coke is great for getting you talking to people if you are shy, but I tend to find it hard to actually get sexual and pick up girls on it because I tend to be too interested in the music or just talking my head off - it kinda destroys my sex drive.<br />Meth is the only drug I&#039;ve found that really helps as it gives you confidence without fucking with your head too much, but to be honest the drug scares the shit out of me so I avoid it.<br /><br />I think plain old alcohol is the best aid, in small-medium doses. The important thing to remember is that if you always use it - you&#039;re not going to be able to pick up without it. I&#039;m firmly in this camp along with the majority of the population, but would love to turn that alcohol confidence into real confidence some day.<br /><br />The biggest thing to remember is that getting rejected is not a big deal and no one cares. Even if your mates give you shit they are secretly just wishing they had the balls to have a go. Girls will even respect you for having a go if you&#039;re not a dick about it. <br />Go get rejected a couple hundred times until you don&#039;t care any more and I guarantee if you keep pushing it without fear of what people might think - you&#039;ll get laid.<br /><br />It&#039;s a long process, but it&#039;s doable. The only question is how much do you want to change?

				why not just find a slightly overweight girl who is also lacking in confidence?&nbsp; <br /><br />just find a chick with one feature you can focus in on, whether it is her face, ass, tits, etc.&nbsp; you just need one.&nbsp; and don&#039;t tell your friends so you don&#039;t have to deal with their judging, silent or otherwise.&nbsp; unless your friends are juggalos.&nbsp; in which case they will most certainly give you the support and encouragement you need to bang a few fat skanks.<br /><br />after you bang this girl she will love you, which gives you the necessary experience of abruptly kicking her out of your life.&nbsp; you will feel desirable and in control of your own experiences.&nbsp; repeat this process a few more times until you&#039;ve got enough confidence to go after slightly better looking girls.<br /><br />i was once like you...a virgin way late into life.&nbsp; i tried using drugs to get girls (adderall and methamphetamine) but it won&#039;t get you very far.&nbsp; when it comes time to close the deal you&#039;re little virgin boy self might rear his ugly head and sabotage the whole deal.<br /><br />i recommend some chubby chicks with fat asses or big tits.&nbsp; and a little bit of alcohol.&nbsp; not too much tho.&nbsp; maybe 5-10 mg of adderall, but be careful with that shit; don&#039;t make it a habit.

				Hey, psychedelia!<br /><br />It&#039;s true that, since you can&#039;t be on drugs all the time, you can&#039;t rely on them exclusively to provide what it is you need to get happier and develop a meaningful relationship with a girl.&nbsp; But they *can* help, especially if you learn things on them that you can apply to your &quot;sober&quot; state.<br /><br />This is part of the magic of MDxx compounds and psychedelics for many people: learning to accept themselves *and* others as people.&nbsp; Not cool people, or lame people, or evil people, or good people ... or in the physical realm, so-called hot people, or so-called ugly people, or so-called fat people, or so-called skinny people ... but people who are a mixture of those extremes to varying degrees, and who, in the final analysis, all have dignity and an eternal beauty.&nbsp; This ties in with the importance of not putting a nice girl that you&#039;re attracted to up on some pedestal that you&#039;ll never be able to climb to, and the equal importance of not taking her for granted once you&#039;ve been together a while in a relationship.&nbsp; It&#039;s also true that, as Sixes said, learning to give &quot;rejection&quot; a chance is where it&#039;s at.&nbsp; You&#039;re not going to be good for everyone (which is what people usually think of as rejection), and everyone is not going to be good for you (which is what people think of as rejecting).&nbsp; But it&#039;s going to be pretty hard to find out who is a good match if you don&#039;t keep trying to be with different people.<br /><br />So maybe some good psychedelic-therapy is in order, probably with a nice, warm drug.&nbsp; You mentioned MDMA doesn&#039;t have the magic anymore, but trying it in a totally different setting can help bring that back.&nbsp; Or give one of the analogues a go like MDA (sorry for what people cannot be blamed for thinking is shameless self-promotion, but MDA doesn&#039;t seem to be very, if at all, cross tolerant with MDMA, and it also seems to have at least a somewhat different mechanism of action).&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Mescaline would also probably be great, although it&#039;s not as easy, since you&#039;d probably have to eat/drink some sacred cactus, though we&#039;ve occasionally seen crystal mescaline on here.&nbsp; Nausea can be an issue with either forms, though we think it&#039;s well fucking worth it.&nbsp; Or maybe some 2C-B?<br /><br />So yeah, take your drugs and go do something fun -- and consider doing it by yourself, so you have time to think about things without having to deal with the distraction of social interactions or the pressure of hitting on girls.&nbsp; You can still even be out in public -- a rave where you don&#039;t know people might be perfect -- but just go enjoy your own company.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see how cool you are, what you have to offer, how you can become even cooler, and how other people are cool, too, but not necessarily cooler, lol.<br /><br />And yeah, when you&#039;re actually out on the prowl, a bit of alcohol or even a low dose of E might be in order, just to get the inhibitions lowered a bit and get over that hurdle.<br /><br />You might not believe this, but you&#039;re actually at an exciting point in your life.&nbsp; There&#039;s a ton of potential exciting romantic interactions just out there waiting for you.&nbsp; Then you&#039;ll have to start thinking about how far and fast you want to take it -- don&#039;t be unnecessarily breaking a bunch of poor girls&#039; hearts, either.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Much love ...

				As a vendor I could several that I provide, but I won&#039;t. As a fellow human I say, find a good therapist (not being sarcastic, seriously) that can get the confidence that is already in you. It might change your life!<br />If you wanna share just PM me and I&#039;ll do what I can to point you in the right direction.

				I second paying for a hooker, you can find some really hot escorts for the right price... they end up being cheaper than going to clubs and paying some stuck up bitch $500 worth of drinks just to have her say she got a headache when it comes time to put out.

				Learning how to get laid is a lot of fucking work, but any man can do it. I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re 300 pounds with purple acne scars all over your back, that shit doesn&#039;t matter. But it takes WORK. YEARS and YEARS of PAINFUL, emotionally distressing WORK that is more painful even than the feeling of never being laid.<br /><br />Now, even with that being said, getting laid while being extremely fucked up sucks ass and is even harder. Your dick don&#039;t work right, you can&#039;t feel things right, everything could be dry, you might puke, you might forget something, and you&#039;ll be a very unattractive hot mess. Being someone that a girl might have to take care of that night is not sexy unless you play guitar or DJ.<br /><br />Basically, the only way to get good at getting laid is to be humiliated to the point of no return by woman after woman after woman after woman. This builds in you the confidence to know what to expect and what to reciprocate to different archetypes of women in order to turn them on. Some of them are turned on by money, some by power, some by integrity, some by muscles, some by facial hair, some by intelligence, some by passion etc etc etc etc<br /><br />As an aside, In high school, I once had 3 hot girls grab me, laugh with each other, and tell me they had decided I was the ugliest guy in school, and then they pushed me over and spit on me. I did not get laid until I was 19. Since then, I have been rejected multiple times even when the girl is naked, my dick is fully out and erect and we have been petting and making out for 40 minutes.<br /><br />But, I have also had threesomes, hooked up with 7 girls in a week, etc. And some of the skills I learned from taking drugs, but ultimately it is an economic decision:<br /><br />The decision is this: Are you rare? Think about it. That&#039;s why you like hot girls: There are less of them. <br /><br />So, anyway, as a guy it is much easier to pretend to be rare. Basically, look at everything that everyone is doing and do the opposite or be more extreme, as long as it won&#039;t get you arrested. Most people are sad dicks who play video games, blame all their problems on anything but themselves, feel unconfident or guilty about the choices they make in life, never get any shit done, are huge emotional, physical, or financial burdens on people around them, and are broke as fuck (if I wasn&#039;t clear about that). If you have something you love in your life (even yourself), and it isn&#039;t video games or Dungeons and Dragons, and you focus on perfecting it, girls will get wet just hearing you talk. By this, you are creating a unique experience that clarifies her mind from the constant blur of bullshit that fills our lives. (And gives her a cloner). If you can be the one dude in pajamas while everyone else has a suit, or you can be the one guy in a suit while everyone else has regular clothes on, you are already spitting what I call &quot;passive game&quot; and attracting people in general, not just women. <br /><br />The number one generalities that girls fall in love with are funniness, loudness, visual uniqueness, and wealth. Most people aren&#039;t funny, most people aren&#039;t loud, most people dress incredibly homogenously, and most people aren&#039;t wealthy. Most people are sad fat dudes dudes who shop at wal mart and post that they want to have sex with a girl on the internet. I know that&#039;s extremely harsh, but pretty much the fact that you posted this on a message board will carry through in your demeanor and will ultimately make girls not turned on by you, and is the reason why internet cam girls can get paid thousands to sit at home and tell dudes &quot;No, I&#039;m not going to do that but you still owe me $500.&quot; <br /><br />If you want to try to get pussy while getting your buzz on, the best choices for you are a small amount of liquor or a small amount of hydrocodone or a small amount of marijuana. The best choices for her is any drug: Mushrooms, Weed, Ecstasy, Liquor, Xanax, etc all seem to make girls much more open to sexual encounters and they don&#039;t seem to alter the juiciness of the pussy. <br /><br />The thing is, YOU cannot offer the drug. Girls already know that you want to fuck them, so by implying ANY sort of transaction you are basically saying &quot;You are a whore, and I will desperately pay you anything for you just to pay attention to me.&quot; The choice of getting fucked up CANNOT COME FROM YOU. it must come from herself or her friends. Never buy a girl a drink, never get her drugs, never offer to take her on vacation, never talk about how much money you make. You may want her to be a whore but unless she is gainfully employed as a prostitute, there is about a 0% chance that the girl thinks of herself as a whore, and by offering to do any kind of service for her you have fucked up your chances of tapping that for a very long time.<br /><br />Oh, you also can both take a little bit of Ecstasy, but a large amount will SHUT YOUR DICK OFF. I don&#039;t care what anyone says: large amounts of intoxicants shut the penis and brain off, which means you aren&#039;t getting laid.<br /><br /><br />Took a long time to write this, but I do it because it both pains me and frustrates me to see dudes not succeeding in getting their dick wet by hot chicks. Ultimately, you must be okay with your hard dick right about to go into Sasha Grey&#039;s mouth and then her telling you &quot;No, I don&#039;t think I can do this,&quot; and then you have to not beat her up.&nbsp; Once you have done this 6 or 7 times, (or simply built up a level of confidence similar to what these experiences will give you), the hottest girl on the planet walking into the room will be as easy to deal with as pumping gas.<br /><br /><br /><br />-baller

The question only is if you want only the bang, or eventually something beyond it.

				Just be your normal self, go to social events/places, and you will find all the trouble you want and more. Unless you are Quasimodo, drugs never help and make it worse. Then you wake up next to Quasimodo. The time to introduce drugs is when you need to make the sex more enjoyable after the 10,000 time you have stuck it in her.&nbsp;

				Hey Dude sex is something that comes around on different schedules for different people. The alpha dudes who cruise around preying on victims should not be seen as cool or bench mark. I have never been good at the chat that gets you to the next bit of chat.... Apart from maybe a couple of girls, its always been them that hunted me.<br />having said that, a solid pipe of meth, good speed are the only drugs that are going to put you in that confident place and keep you there. All the others will get you started then quite possibly leave you stranded.<br />I was high the other night and had a peek at dating/ casual sex sites. I joined one just to see, i saw some good looking hookers and i got a couple of propositions from some very scary looking women. Too scary for me i have been a very lucky lover and have only ever had good looking girls. I have friends who go on dates from these sites&nbsp; &nbsp;and they rave and go on and on about the sex with heaps of different chicks. So get on that straight up<br /><br />Sometimes your down<br />So low and blue<br />Haven bad thoughts<br />Bout makin it through<br /><br />No matter how bad<br />No matter how blue,<br />Stayin alive<br />You can still sing the blues<br /><br />Good luck man and remember, the whole show keeps spinnin and changin around, my observations after 50 years, has been every person in the developed world has their time in the sun as the slut of all sluts. Women too. So stay in shape and be ready to play&nbsp;

				Ok i have looked at all of these horrible answers, you don&#039;t need to fukin take meth, mdma, cocaine or any drug for that fact.<br /><br />You have just come onto a forum talking about self harm.... all because i&#039;m assuming your still a virgin. Honestly who gives a fuk? As long as you don&#039;t go around advertising it. We have all been there, it&#039;s a part of growing up. Now i&#039;ll give you some proper advice instead of posting on this forum turn your fukin computer off &amp; go for a run! Any form of excersice is great (It&#039;ll release endorphins). Starting eating healthier red meats, fuit, veg etc. Get ya fukin daily intake of vitamins. Next start weight lifting nothing gives u more confidence than being proud of your own body. I suggest having a break from any type of drug and getting your mind a body in tact before you turn to narcotics for a confidence boost. Peace

				I am with ^^^^^ this poster. Get out and learn to have some fun. You can&#039;t meet someone sitting at the computer or curled up in bed. Join a club or something is a great idea. <br /><br />The way you see yourself is not the way you really are or even the way others see you. <br /><br />If your nervous or keep to yourself a lot then girls might just think you are not interested in them. Rather than look for drugs research how to flirt or something like that. You need girls to know you are interested and available. <br /><br />Loneliness sucks so I understand why you are feeling so depressed. Once you get out and make true friends you will meet someone that sees you as someone special. <br /><br />Hope things get better for you bro. <br /><br />If you truly feel like you are going to harm yourself please reach out for help. Why not go to a support group to talk to people. Their are girls there too&nbsp; ;) <br />

				I&#039;m normally pretty awkward too, but in the afterglow of a strong LSD trip I found myself with an incredible feeling of confidence, walking around saying hello to strangers and not giving a shit about any of the people who responded negatively. I&#039;m planning to try this again sometime next week to see if it was just a fluke. <br /><br />That said, how does one find a hot escort anyway? How can you be sure you aren&#039;t talking to a cop? Or worse, that she has the aids?

You can&#039;t be sure by looking unless very sick. If she looks like a junkie than def walk away. <br />Just like drugs be careful how you say things. <br /><br />Treat her well. Don&#039;t be rude. <br /><br />Maybe someone will be able to give you a better answer than this. Just wanted you to get a real answer and not a bunch of funnies.&nbsp;

				Take excessive amounts of steroids and hgh for a couple of months. Buy a nice fitting shirt and jeans, groom yourself, go to&nbsp; a crowed bar and let the girls come to you.<br /><br />drugs will only give you temporary confidence, once they wear off your back to your old self. If you want lasting confidence you need to find the things that make you feel inferior to everyone else and work on improving them.

				I would say take LSD to realize that should accept yourself completely as you are -- love yourself. Women like men who know who they are and confident with their personalities. I think you are confusing confidence with assertiveness or something of the such. I have a feeling that you would approach a women and try to appeal to her by liking whatever she likes and blah, blah, blah. That isn&#039;t what is attractive (subjective). Be yourself in every situation you are in. Don&#039;t act different in front of different people unless there are legal or monetary consequences. <br /><br />Something else: you seem like you just want to fuck ANY girl. This is a turn off because they want to feel like you CHOSE them. They weren&#039;t just the first person to give it up to you as you went down the line of every girl you&#039;ve met. Make them understand that you are completely happy alone and independent, but that you really enjoy their company, their personality, and their body. Be fucking genuine. Don&#039;t be what you think they want -- it is obvious you don&#039;t know --be who you are.
