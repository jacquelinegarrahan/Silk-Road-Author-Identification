				So I&#039;m just wondering if anybody has any preferred alternative herbs for rolling up spliffs? I&#039;m a non-smoker and, although it&#039;s tolerable, weed and tobacco just isn&#039;t enjoyable for me. I&#039;ve ordered 50g of both raspberry leaves and damiana to try out but they&#039;re not in yet.<br /><br />For anyone in North America who doesn&#039;t know what spliffs are, smokers in Europe (especially the UK) tend to mix weed and tobacco when rolling.

				I&#039;ve had friends that used hemp (the cannabis without THC) to mix with weed, weed and hemp go along really well but it&#039;s that easy to find. Some herbal teas are also good to smoke, it tastes good!

				You can order some wild dagga flowers.&nbsp; Saw some videos on YouTube of people smoking it in a joint.&nbsp; They said it tastes pretty good, not harsh, burns nice, and has a slight relaxing properties on it&#039;s own.

				Nah never tried it but most people say it&#039;s effects are very minimal. I will post back here with a review of both the Damiana I ordered and the Raspberry leaf. Mixed with Hash, as that&#039;s what I&#039;m holding at the moment.

				If you somehow dislike the effect of nicotine in the mix, just use the tobacco from ultra light cigs like barclays. <br /><br />Cannabis can be smoked pure as well if its the right stuff, but if its hash like that would be problematic. Crumling up a normal cigarette and mixing that in works very well, regardgess if its a full flavor cig or a very light one.

				Yeah the Damiana and Raspberry leaves together were only 3 bucks so I thought I might as well give it a try, failing that I&#039;m just going to hunt out the lightest and least harsh tobacco I can get. I love how easy tobacco in the mix makes rolling anyway.<br /><br />For anyone breezing by who smokes, have you ever had a cigarette where you felt like you would have to smoke like 3 to get your fix? My friends say they&#039;ve bummed smokes where it&#039;s just like sucking air.

				I&#039;ve found the only thing to mix smke with, other than tobacco, is more smoke. Or else just take up vaping.<br />I love cannabis. If you do to, I&#039;m sure diluting it with anything else - you&#039;re not addicted to (tobacco) - will just be an insult. Aim to get a vaporizer. It&#039;s not the same, but that&#039;s not the point if you&#039;re doing this for health reasons

				I have used Coltsfoot in the past which is a fine fluffy leaf, can be mixed with other &quot;harder&quot; things like peppermint. mullein is quite strong and i find it to give a slightly uncomfortable narcotic feeling.<br />I used nicotina rustica also - as opposed to nicotianum tobacum, with a lot of success. However this is a deep plant and needs a lot of respect (eg never mix with alcohol)

				Have you tried menthol tobacco instead of regular? I find that it&#039;s noticeably less harsh for mixing with weed or hash.

				I was thinking of trying ginko bilboa. I&#039;m not sure if you can smoke it or not, or how harsh it is, but I read others saying that a cup of strong ginko tea before smoking definitely alters the effect.<br /><br />There&#039;s other potentiators I read about, like high omega 3 products such as fish oil. I guess the thought being that if you take that over time it increases increases the quantity of THC receptors in the brain? I didn&#039;t fully check that one out though.

				Err... why not just remove the nicotine from the tobacco?&nbsp; Tobacco produced for smoking is exactly that, a plant material that has been processed(somewhat extensively) for the specific purpose of smoking.&nbsp; Nicotine is water soluable, get some tobacco, throw it in a cup of water, leave it for an hour or so, then take it out and let it dry.&nbsp; Smoking medium without psychoactivity.
