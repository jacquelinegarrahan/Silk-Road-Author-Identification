				For those with experience with a wide range of opiate withdrawals how would you compare them? Heroin has this horrible rep but I will take H withdrawals any day over methadone or oxycodone. I am a long time opiate user and have been through withdrawal many times. Some worse than others. First H withdrawal to me is the hardest hitting but shortest lasting. Oxycodone doesn&#039;t hit as hard but lasts me for weeks. Then there is methadone withdrawal which kicked the shit out of me for 6 weeks. Anyways if you have been through any sort of opiate withdrawal you know they are hell. If you have not been through opiate withdrawal just imagine the worse case of the flu possible combined with no sleep etc. Anyways im curious how others with experience would compare different forms of opiate withdrawal. I can&#039;t imagine anything being worse than methadone but maybe that&#039;s just me.

				i definitely agree done is one of the worst just because of the duration<br /><br />if you arent careful with subs and get your dose down quickly and taper correctly it can be hell <br /><br />anyone who is unfortunate enough to develop a serious fent habit, like those who synth analogues will basically be fucked forever due to their potency, but fortunately this is not a common occurrence<br /><br />i am not sure which i think is worse, oxy or H... i would almost actually say oxy. at least with H its intense but shorter lasting.<br /><br />i would be interested to hear others opinions on H vs Oxy as well. kinda seems strange prescription oxy could be worse than H (not IV)

				each opiate has its downfalls, h is very rough and quick, 3-4 days and i am back to semi normal,&nbsp; oxymorphone that is like 8 days, and oxycodon like 8 too.&nbsp; Methadone and Sub good luck, you will feel like shit a month <br /><br />wht i recommend is getting codiene 30mgs, and using them to taper, only take as many as keep you from being sick, like maybe 60mg every 4-6 hours, and taper down.&nbsp; &nbsp;after a week, u should be taking maybe 2-3 a day, then just get som valium and go cold turkey, it aint that bad :)

				I actually thought Methadone withdrawals weren&#039;t to bad....I got locked up and had to go cold turkey off of Methadone and even though it lasted much longer then heroin withdrawals, it felt less intense? like more spaced out if that makes sense. I was only on 60mg/daily though so I&#039;m sure that played a role in it. I imagine the people on doses of 200mg+ go through hell.<br /><br />I would say the worst withdrawal I have ever been through is the one night that I took a Suboxone too soon after my lost shot of dope and went through precipitated withdrawals....HOLY FUCK DID THAT SUCK! I seriously wanted to die, I was shitting and puking at the same time and couldn&#039;t stop....like 3 days worth of withdrawals hitting you all at the same time! I copped 5 bags of dope in the morning and had to shoot all of them to get relief. I&#039;ll never make that mistake again!

				I would have to give the gold medal without a doubt to Methadone ... god awful long withdrawals ... But, when I had w/d from Methadone, I was incarcerated for an assault charge and spent 30 days in jail ... I was sick the entire time ... so maybe that is why I think it is so bad.<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually experienced w/d from Fentanyl.&nbsp; I used to get 4 100mcg patches in trade for an ounce of shwag or 1 patch per quarter (would LOVE to still have that connect).&nbsp; Anyway, after a 10 patch in 15 days day binge I ran out and had nothing ... the withdrawals were different than other opiates ... it was terrible, it was a lot more psychological than typical opiate w/d ... it had the psychological effect of benzo w/d (which in my opinion can be worse than opiate w/d) ... coupled with the physiological effects of opiate w/d ... the good thing was it only lasted for about 2- 3 days, but IIRC, I think that I got some perc 5s or something that helped me ease out of it.&nbsp; That was my last dance with Fentanyl, I assure you. <br /><br />Next would be OCs, then I would go with H.&nbsp; <br /><br />Subs, now that is another thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have been on suboxone 4 years in about 17 days (yes 4 years).&nbsp; My prescribing doctor has been my family doctor my entire life (fortunately).&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ve tried going off of it a few times, but I haven&#039;t been able to shake it.&nbsp; Today, I take 1/8th of a 2mg tablet ... and believe it or not (and it MIGHT BE entirely placebo, IDK) it makes a huge difference in how I feel.&nbsp; I (yes very stupidly and probably because I have a needle fetish) shot subs one time because this girl I was seeing swore it didn&#039;t make her sick, anyway, not the case for me ... that was terrible too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take what you want from this :)

				11 - is it the withdrawals from sub that make you unable to stop using them?&nbsp; or maybe if you stop them you just seek out other opis?<br /><br />also do you get mild opiate effects from them or just feel normal?

				I think your mental state has a LOT to do with it too. I&#039;ve had times coming off dope where I am a complete wreck, and other where I was doing fine other than the puking, and shitting. Nowadays I am too old to fuck around with that withdrawal shit, and just go on lope to ease off and then taper down off of that

				Methadone is the winner. It took me 5 weeks. The worst part is the lack of sleep. Sleep deprivation for a month. It was literally driving me crazy. Worst part, sleep meds wouldn&#039;t work. In fact they made it worse.<br />
