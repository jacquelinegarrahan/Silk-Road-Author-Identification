				Hello all, I posted this in off topic but no one ever replied. My question was if Ive been taking 1mg xanax a day for the past 2 days, would I be able to take 25i today? Or would it have no effect. Do benzos work like SSRI&#039;s as to where they diminish the effects, or do benzos just make you come down once your trippin. I took 1 tab 1000microgram of 25i 2 days ago. Can i take 2000mg and be trippin today after the xanax use from yesterday and the day before?

				Benzo&#039;s don&#039;t work like SSRI&#039;s. You should be able to trip today.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t like 25I-NBOMe as it was repeatedly sold to me in the 90&#039;s as LSD. But to each their own. <br /><br />I would keep those Benzo&#039;s handy for the ride down if you know what I mean.<br />

Also, I suppose 2mg would be a okay dose to start at after 2 day&#039;s, The resistance built when taking 25i for the first time in a time&nbsp; period is vastly significant. it takes about 5-7 days for the same dose to do close to the same effects and up to 14 days for a single dose to have the full ground breaking intense effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also just one more side note though its obvious but if you take 3 tabs one day and 1 tab the day after or a few days after dont expect anything to happen, just a shitty taste. ( if you read t5&#039;s warnings in his descriptions and i&#039;ve also had massive benzo users have no effects at all from nbome&#039;s or other tryptamine&#039;s)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />tl:dr- Yes benzo&#039;s will make you more immune but it&#039;s questionable as to how much they affect.

				I apologize, I was crabby earlier. To be certain, I&#039;m not sure what I bought that was sold to me as Acid. I just know that it was on blotter and it could have been a lot of things. <br /><br />No, there are no cops on these threads profiling us. I have a high status job in Washington, DC working as the President and I just don&#039;t want to be caught by giving out niggling little details about my personal life. <br /><br />Apologies to everyone involved.<br />
