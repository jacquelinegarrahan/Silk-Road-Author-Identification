				For example: Your with a few friends in a car. The driver isn&#039;t high or on any drugs at all. Before you left, you a few other friends took MDMA and smoked some weed. Although, they got rid of EVERYTHING before they left. <br /><br />Now, you get pulled over by a police office for some random reason. If the officer expects the passengers are on illicit substances, could the officer arrest someone or charge someone if they were on the substances, but none of the substances were on the person at the time? Maybe intoxicated in public?<br /><br />Just something I&#039;ve always wondered. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m wondering about the United States.

				Depends where you live. In my country the officer could conduct a saliva drug-test to the passengers if he suspects they&#039;re under the influence of illicit substances. If the test is positive he/she would then arrest the intoxicated person and take him to a blood test for a more accurate drug test. If the blood test is also positive the person would be charged and fined for using drugs and would probably get his house searched so they could also charge him with possession as well. The person would also get his name to a sort of drug offenders&#039; registry for the next five years, which means the police can conduct random house and vehicle searches for that time.

				Really depends on where you are, but if I understand correctly, for the most part being high isn&#039;t actually illegal (unless you live in California, where many counties apparently have laws against being high). It&#039;s usually only the possession that&#039;s illegal. And if you&#039;re in your car, you&#039;re not actually out in public, so you couldn&#039;t get arrested for public intoxication in that instance. When it comes down to it, it will be very difficult for them to prove that you were on drugs no matter what (as opposed to just being a slightly strange person), so I wouldn&#039;t be terribly concerned about it.

				As long as the driver is sober then your fine - your actually doing a service transporting inebriated people who might otherwise be a danger to themselves.<br /><br />But this largely depends on the circumstances - you probably got pulled over for something you did wrong, or at least a check point. In both cases your friends make you guilty by association and the officers have probable cause to take you in for a possible DUI - but as you said the driver is not under the influence, so you should be fine. They might try and scare you into giving up a dealer or implicating yourselves but it&#039;s not against the law to smell like drugs or to be around drug users. Your traveling in a car with a sober drive - so public intoxication is out of the question - if this ever did go to court I feel even the dumbest lawyer could get you off.

				About 3 yrs ago I was leaving a Hardcore Festival, floating about 3 feet off the ground. I stepped onto the train and found a spot to stand.

				It depends on where you live and what cop(s) you end up getting stuck with.<br /><br />I was in a hairy situation where luckily I, the driver was the only sober one, and the cops took that seriously.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, they made me smash my bong (fuckers), made everyone pour out like 24 beers, seized 14g weed from me (immediately as soon as I opened my door to exit the vehicle upon his request, and right into his pocket to ... I LOVE Canadian cops lol).&nbsp; <br /><br />One person was candy-flipping at the time, 2 others were on just large doses of LSD and one was just strictly rolling (plus alcohol plus weed plus childhood) and it was quite obvious (well to me and i was sober) that almost everyone in my car was FUCKED on something harder then weed or alcohol.&nbsp; <br /><br />They let me go scott free though, just said &#039;go home RIGHT now&quot; (which I DID, fuck to get out of there you don&#039;t know the relief), followed then by me beating the shit out of my &#039;friend&#039; who decided in the first place it would be fun to shout out of the back window of my car at a passing cop car while I was parked in another friends driveway (none of this would have ever happened if fuckbag kept his lips shut lol).<br /><br />In most countries i&#039;m aware of the only thing they can get you on is &#039;public intoxication&#039;.&nbsp; I know in many states you have the option to blow a breathalyzer or give blood, if you choose the breathalyzer it won&#039;t pick up any other drug your on so just never submit to giving blood if you&#039;re pulled over.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is no law that I know of that allows them to link the quantized evidence of drug metabolites in your blood with the TIME the incident took place.&nbsp; You&#039;d need to have illicit substances on you (and they have PC to search you if you are messed up and acting like it, so don&#039;t carry if you&#039;re gonna trip).

				I don&#039;t believe that any states accept a blood sample as proof of intoxication while driving. The metabolites stay in the blood for far too long to prove that you were actually still high when the sample was taken.

				How would they know you&#039;re on LSD unless you told them? I think it only shows up for a day in blood since it&#039;s such a tiny amount. I don&#039;t think they can even detect it in saliva or urine.<br /><br />When I got busted for weed they didn&#039;t charge me with public intoxication and I was obviously high. My car was there, but I wasn&#039;t driving when I got caught. There were 4 or 5 cases of beer in the trunk for a 4th of July party and we were all under 21. For some reason they didn&#039;t even take the beer maybe because none of them were open. That was pretty cool of them.<br /><br />The only way the passengers would get in trouble in the USA is if they were drunk underage or acting like fools in front of the cops. <br /><br />

				If you have said illicit substance on you, charges could range from being under the influence of an illicit substance, to possession, possession with the intent to distribute / traffick , trafficking in school zone, etc. If you don&#039;t have anything on you, and you tell them you&#039;re not on anything, the most they can do is commit you to a psych ward involuntarily if you&#039;re acting crazy. There are no valid on the spot drug tests they can perform like breathalyzers for alcohol to determine blood concentrations of substances (currently). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19460.msg196133#msg196133">Quote from: snipeemfl0 on April 18, 2012, 09:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For example: Your with a few friends in a car.

Although, they got rid of EVERYTHING before they left. <br /><br />Now, you get pulled over by a police office for some random reason. If the officer expects the passengers are on illicit substances, could the officer arrest someone or charge someone if they were on the substances, but none of the substances were on the person at the time? Maybe intoxicated in public?<br /><br />Just something I&#039;ve always wondered. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m wondering about the United States.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
