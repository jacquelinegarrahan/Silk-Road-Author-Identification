				Hey folks,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to a festival pretty soon and I&#039;m wondering if I should go ahead and take two tabs of Tessellated&#039;s LSD. I&#039;ve never taken 400 mcg before, but I&#039;m pretty good at handling myself on ~200. There&#039;s going to be a lake, so I&#039;m really looking forward to swimming and dancing to music while tripping (not to mention random adventuring around), so I&#039;m wondering, what&#039;s your guys&#039; experience with the difference between 200 mcg and 400 mcg? Will 400 mcg put me in a different world? Or will I be able to participate in the festivities still?

				I would tend to say 400 mics is fine for a festival, unless perhaps it&#039;s like a death metal festival or something intensely scary lol(But even 100 mics would suck then). I took 3.5 tabs of Tesselated&#039;s tabs and although I did choose to lay down quite a bit towards the end, I walked probably 3-4 miles during my peak and I would have been fine at a nice friendly hippy type festival. And no, I don&#039;t believe 400 mics has that much chance of taking you out of body or &quot;in a different world&quot;, although your world is certain to become much different.&nbsp; ;)

				In my experience I can handle 200ug in a public setting and behave not too strange. Also I can manage my thought processes.<br />On 400ug I will be seriously trippng - at least during the first 3-4 hours and what goes on in my mind is not really under control and I would be worried that I would not handle things well if events turns uncomfortable. Most bad trips I have seen and had reported are people taking a large dose (which 400ug is) in a bad setting. <br />Typically in company of people who start acting agressive or strongly negative. Its not uncommon to get a certain amount of paranoia during a trip (like feeling people stare at you or want to hurt you or steal your stuff) and in a huge strange crowd this can quickly turn ugly.<br /><br />I guess it mainly depends what your tolerance is, what kind of festival it is, who you will be with (will there be someone who will take care to save your ass if things go bad) and what kind of audience it attracts (if you can safely act weirdly and agresive assholes are few).<br /><br />For most people I would say that the right place to first take a large dose of LSD is not in a crowd of strangers<br />

				Busta has the right idea there. I wouldnt suggest 400ug, especially not for your first time on such a dose, in the setting that you mention.<br /><br />The potential for disaster is infinite. Being your first 400ug dose, your almost certain to lose your shit in some way or another, begging for the trip to end, which it will not, leaving you with a terrible over all experience. <br /><br />Im sure you think it will be all sugar plums and snozberries, but fact of the matter is that when ever you up your high dose mark, you experience a whole new level of intensity with each step up. I dont see it possible to actually enjoy your first 400ug dose in any populated public setting.

				Thanks for your help guys! I think I&#039;ll probably try taking 300 mcg. I&#039;m very curious about getting into stronger trips, especially reading what people say on these forums about how 200 is a starting point, but I think I&#039;ll take it slow.
