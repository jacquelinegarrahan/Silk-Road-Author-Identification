				I&#039;ve been looking into these myself. One good post was dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27299.msg297088#msg297088, so maybe start there?<br /><br />If you have more specific questions you may want to rephrase your post. There is a lot of information ranging from chemistry to pharmacology to just plain old experiences.

				Erowid has a lot of information. That&#039;s probably going to be your quickest way to finding out information. Or just a simple Google search on clearnet will produce results. You&#039;re not going to get in trouble for simply researching drugs.

				When people talk about the 2C family, they are referring to a class of psychedelics generally called &quot;substituted phenethylamines&quot;. The &quot;2C&quot; comes from the fact that there are &quot;2 carbons&quot; in the &quot;backbone&quot; of the phenethylamine molecule. If you go to Google and look up an image for phenethylamine, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m referring to.<br /><br />Since they all have this similar nomenclature (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-C, etc) it&#039;s a pretty fair assumption most beginners make to assume that they are all very &quot;similar&quot; to one another. In actuality, they can be dramatically different in both effects and potency.<br /><br />As a class of compounds, they can have some negative side effects you may not like - nausea, cramping, headaches, variable duration of come-up, etc. The dosage required for effects is also variable from person to person. Even though you sound like you have a strong opiod tolerance, I wouldn&#039;t expect that to carry over to these compounds. As for the M1 (methylone), that compound has a very different pharmacological mechanism and I wouldn&#039;t expect tolerance to it to carry over either.<br /><br />The 2C family can be pretty seriously psychedelic and if you are just looking for a good time or a fun buzz, it might not be the best choice, but there are certainly a few that may be worth your time. I will give you my recommendations when I get to the descriptions of each in a moment.<br /><br />There are three types of 2C you will find around here and I will break them down according to *my own personal experiences* with them. Your mind may vary and I would advise reading on Erowid &amp; Bluelight extensively before investing in them. I would also recommend that you absolutely do not bother with any of the 2C drugs unless you have a nice milligram scale. Some people manage to get away with eyeballing, but I would never advise it. Even a 5mg difference can totally change the effects.<br /><br />When I discuss these chems, I&#039;m going based on my experiences at &quot;average&quot; doses per Erowid, etc. If you take a very high dose of *any* of them including 2C-C (despite what many will say), you can wind up in a full-blown, reality-destroying, rolling in your own vomit type of mindfuck. At the same time, taking a barely threshold dose can result in nice anti-depressant stimulation, or just a stomach-ache. You&#039;ll have to figure out your own personal dose-response curve on your own, but always start low!<br /><br />One last precaution - I really recommend having a benzodiazepine (Etizolam, Xanax, Valium) and an anti-psychotic (Haldol, Risperidone) around when you try these. I have saved my ass many a time with the anti-psychotics and sometimes you will come down from the trip but be entirely unable to sleep without the benzodiazepine. The benzos are also helpful when someone is having a &quot;rough&quot; trip. Save the antipsychotics for when you are in serious trouble.<br /><br />ALL DOSES GIVEN ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES. DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY AND ALSO QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT, IT MAY VARY. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO START LOW. START LOW. START LOW. INCREASE SLOWLY! IF NOTHING ELSE, REMEMBER THAT PLEASE!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Halogenated 2C-x<br />In my experience, these are generally gentler and more &quot;fun&quot; than the alkylated or thiolated 2Cs we will discuss next. These are the closest to psychedelic candy that you will find in this family. The &quot;halogen&quot; refers to the bromine, chlorine, or iodine atom that is placed on the phenethylamine ring.<br /><br />2C-C - least potent by dose, mellow, minimal mind-fuck, &quot;sparkly&quot; visuals.&nbsp; (Dose: ~30-45mg)<br />2C-B - best body high for me, interesting mind-space, can be very euphoric and recreational at 15-20mg, a true-blue psych at higher doses. (Dose: ~15-30mg)<br />2C-I - longest duration of halogens, crazy &quot;beams&quot; of light I do not get on any other 2C, very stimulating, headspace clear until higher doses. (Dose: ~7-20mg)<br /><br />All three of these combine well with many other drugs. I have found 2C-C and 2C-B to go very well with mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, LSD, MDMA, and weed. 2C-I is very popular but I suspect that has more to do with availability than anything else. I prefer 2C-B over 2C-I because the duration is shorter, the body-high is better (for me), and the headspace is more &quot;fun&quot;. Also, as the man who invented 2C-B said: &quot;Wherever you are with 2C-B, just hold on tight, in another hour you will be back to somewhere recognizable&quot; (paraphrased). 2C-C is a great compound - it has a fantastic headspace and very interesting visuals, but I feel somewhat mellow / relaxed and also do not get the interesting tactile sensations on it that I do from 2C-B.<br /><br />My recommendation for halogenated 2C-x: 2C-B. Whether it is the HCl or HBr salt, it is a great product. Look for anyone trusted on SR selling it and make sure it is whitish - you don&#039;t want anything brown or yellow - that means it wasn&#039;t washed very well.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Alkylated 2C-x<br /><br />These are 2C-x chemicals where instead of a halogen (bromine, chlorine, iodine) you have a carbon or carbon chain attached to the phenethylamine ring. With the exception of 2C-D, I find these to be much more &quot;serious&quot; than the halogenated phenethylamines. There are really only three that you are going to see around here.<br /><br />2C-D: Least potent, most forgiving, made me feel somewhat drunk or stoned, visuals were nothing unique until higher doses. (Dose: 35-75mg)<br />2C-E: Most popular, can be rough on body, serious visuals. Can be wildly euphoric and manic or very dark. A true psychedelic in every way. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br />2C-P: Absolutely brutal for me. Jittery and hard on my body, mind absolutely destroyed, duration &quot;infinite&quot;. (Dose: 3-12mg)<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend 2C-P to anyone. True psychonauts will seek it out on their own, but it&#039;s not my thing and I think it is too long and too rough for most people. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it unless you build your way up to it with other psychs first. 2C-D is very rare and some people really love it. I was not too impressed by it but it was forgiving and pleasant enough that I will definitely continue to return to it. 2C-E is bar none the &quot;winner&quot; when it comes to these three but I can only recommend it with the caveat that you absolutely start low with the dose.<br /><br />My recommendation for alkylated 2C-x: 2C-E. For some people, this is very recreational. All I will say is that in my experience, it has not been. I also feel no desire to go back to it, but I&#039;m glad I have tried it. I would recommend that you try it at home first and see how you react. It can be very beautiful visually but the body load was too much for me. You will be hard pressed to find a 2C-x that is more legendary or popular though.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thiolated 2C-x<br /><br />These all have a sulfur atom attached to the phenethylamine ring. There are lots of reports out there that indicate wildly varying dose-response curves and durations amongst individuals and I have found this to be very true in my own experience. The same dose of 2C-T-2 that barely affected me put my old girlfriend into outerspace for 8 hours. The duration tends to be longer and the mental effects more serious than the halogenated 2C compounds, but the visuals are wild for me. Again, you&#039;ll probably only see three of these.<br /><br />2C-T-2: My personal favorite but only due to circumstances that occurred while using it. Some GI distress but wild beams of light and fractal patterning, &quot;neutral&quot; and analytical headspace, somewhat dissociating for me. (Dose: 7-25mg)<br />2C-T-4: Only one I have not tried. Read some trip reports - duration is very long. Rare, does not seem to have enjoyable effects profile for most.<br />2C-T-7: Legendary, feels to me like a longer lasting, more visual, more euphoric 2C-T-2. I was far less lucid or coherent but had a much more enjoyable body buzz. Some trembling, tension, and cramping. Lasted much longer than DOC for me. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br /><br />If you find yourself enjoying 2C-E, these will probably be right up your alley. My experiences with T-2 and T-7 are similar to mine with 2C-E in that I&#039;m glad I had them, I can see the appeal and I enjoyed the ride, but I don&#039;t feel particularly compelled to return to them.<br /><br />My recommendation for thiolated 2C-x: 2C-T-2. The thiolated 2C-x compounds are a bit notorious due to the deaths from T-7 and T-21. This is generally regarded to be due to MAO-I (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) activity, so they shouldn&#039;t be combined with medication or other drugs although some still do so.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now, this is a totally shitty guide I have written for you here. Many will have DRAMATICALLY different opinions of these chems and doses. I hope that this at least gives you a ballpark idea of where to start. I personally recommend that you begin with 2C-B. Get a small amount, try a 15mg dose. See where it takes you. Wait a week and try a 20mg dose. Titrate up in a similar manner until you find what you&#039;re looking for. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, by all means explore the rest of the family, but just keep in mind the experience is different every time, every chem.<br /><br />I would recommend personally that you find a good LSD vendor (read reviews and make sure they aren&#039;t selling 25I-NBOMe or DOx on blotter) or a good source for 4-AcO-DMT / mushrooms and try those as well.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t look to anything I&#039;ve said as being textbook or authoritative - read up at Bluelight and Erowid.<br /><br />In any case, I hope you find what you are looking for.

				Just start with 2C-B, that&#039;s all you need to know. Also they&#039;re all much better after taking some MDMA a few hours before.<br /><br />With the 2C family, you need to be fairly careful with doses, you&#039;re not going to kill yourself but the doses do need to be pretty accurate, so get some good milligram scales. 26 to 29 milligrams is a perfect amount of 2C-B. 23 milligrams and you won&#039;t feel anything, 31 milligrams and you can go a bit crazy. Like I said, you won&#039;t kill yourself, but you won&#039;t enjoy yourself either.

				is this stuff like the @-ci NBOMEe ? or something like dat ? what is that stuff ?they look like lil&#039; blotters of acid, and since i never tried that stuff, is it safer or cooler for someone who say , would like to try something similar to LSD , but without all the side-effects?

It&#039;s like a combination of the both but milder.<br /><br />The only reason I personally prefer 2C-B over LSD is that with 2C-B you are still mentally in control, making the decisions and deciding what you think about, with good LSD you loose that control. It&#039;s OK to loose that control, fantastic even, but not on your first psychedelic high, it can be scary, like jumping in the deep end of a swimming pool when you can&#039;t swim. I won&#039;t advice people to do that.

				+1 Oscar <br />now i know... is it really that hard mentally while on LSD ?<br />i mean damn maybe depth perception and all that is sure shocked out of balance.. but do people really feel like they can fly ? or they just wanted to feel a breeze and didn&#039;t measure right or something and overstepped thier boundries ?<br />i gotta try this.. do u know a reputable 2-C vendor ?

				Even though probably very few has come up to my dosage i would still not recommend 2c-p. Took roughly 45mg of 2c-p for my first trip.<br /><br />Thought i died twice. Beat the shit out of my friend. Hit some random dude and ended up in a drunk tank while missing the concert i had tickets to. <br />It was hell on earth, believe me.<br /><br />I have a very detailed trip report if people are interested. Would have to translate it first though.

One of my favorite benefits of taking 2C-B a few hours after MDMA is that the next day and week you don&#039;t get that usual MDMA low because the 2C-B being a psychedelic is a natural anti-depressant and leaves you feeling great for a while.
