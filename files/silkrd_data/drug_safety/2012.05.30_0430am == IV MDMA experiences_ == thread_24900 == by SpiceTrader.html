				Haha, you&#039;re set on shooting something, eh? I&#039;ve never tried it, but from what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s extremely fast and intense, and most reports I&#039;ve read say something along the lines of, &quot;Glad I did it, but wouldn&#039;t try again&quot;. If you do end up doing it, I&#039;d be interested in a trip report. Check over at Erowid... they have a handful of reports on IV MDMA.

				Do it!<br /><br />Make sure you are rolling first though..take a little less than your normal dose and wait to come up.&nbsp; Once you are rolling hit that shit and blast off into a HUGE peak!<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t IV before you are rolling, It&#039;s not very fun going 0-60 when it instantly hits you.&nbsp; Like I said above just make sure you are rolling first and whenever you want a sweet peak bang like 25mg I think is what I used to.&nbsp; Always start small IV.<br /><br />Be Safe!<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				So i&#039;ve been rolling all night-probably ate 300mg&#039;s of very potent, almost uncut and was having an awesome time, but now i&#039;m the only one awake and had a rig laying around so i thought what the hell so i found a rig that i&#039;ve had sitting around (i used to bang all types of shit, but haven&#039;t in hellas)<br /><br />I cooked up about .25 of this shit and banged it IV about fifteen minutes ago and i&#039;m fucking flying high as fuck right now!&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s just because of the previous doses (ate my last bit about two hours ago) or what, but i feel amazing!<br /><br />This brought back my roll significantly as I just sit here and listen to some awesome music thinking about all the good things in life. <br /><br />I feel like everything you do should be in moderation and not let the drug consume your entire body and mind but rather guide it into true happiness!<br /><br />ahh, im so fucked up i don&#039;t even know if any of this makes sense or not

				Well DeadRa7, i will be able to chime in on the &#039;butt chug&#039; method, as I have done that on my last months molly trip<br /><br />It was intense and pleasurable. (not so much the insertion though)<br /><br />An oral syringe is easy to get, mdma mixes ridiculously easy with it, not much mixture is needed and ya just gotta go a little far up in there. <br /><br />its not really hard to hold it in man, you dont feel anything. im not sure if people are shooting fire hoses up there or something but that little amount is fine to hold and in like 15-30 minutes go take a shit or something.<br /><br />but the comeup is much better in my opinion, (less anxiety) but do not do what i did, was take the exact amount you would take orally,<br /><br />cause, although, it was awesome, at one point as i walked around i had some muscle twitching in my arm and leg, nothing crazy, it was&nbsp; laughable, but i felt like the lead singer in radiohead in his music video lotus flower hahaha

				Okay... so i just banged 20MGs MDMA. Not a lot, just a test. The effects were quite fast, only about 2 minutes to peak. Certainly better than rectal or nasal in my opinion.

Possibly in another hour or so, LOL!<br /><br />Update: Just banged 20 more. Feels good. I&#039;m sure a fullblown 100MGs+ would be kinda crazy, but just a little will get you where you need to be.

				So i ended up IVing most of a gram over about 12 hours, probably banging 100 mgs at a time, it was completely&nbsp; different to other ROAs , i was getting rushes after each shot, basically couldnt get off the lounge at this point, my eyes were going mental for about ten minutes after each, but once the rush was over it really didnt feel all that amazing, didnt really have &quot;legs&quot;, like i was still high as fuck, but with no empathetic feeling really.... This was a gram of Pfers gear as well, so im assuming from what ive ready that its good quality... Also the urge to redose was huge, wether thats my inner junky coming out i dont know... But it is defs fun shooting it, the taste that goes up through your neck is AMAZING...

				the only thing that would scare me about this is the possibility of impurities from mdma synthesis. i would imagine small impurities wouldn&#039;t hurt you orally, or nasal because it is passed through your liver/kidneys. but when you shoot something it doesn&#039;t get filtered through your body right?

It had a killer rush and made me feel hot as hell for about 5 minutes right after injection. <br />I&#039;m going to do some research of my own to determine how unhealthy this ROA is. If there are any M1 experts out there, please convince me to stop (I don&#039;t need to hear the dangers of IV itself, I know) I just want to know if there is a good enough reason to not take MQ this way.

The water you will inject will sit under your skin and act like a petre dish at the perfect bacteria gowing temperature.

				Mixed it with some heroin in the same shot too. good lord...! Beware: you WILL feel the heroin after the molly fades away, so dose carefully. You feel the heroin kick in first, that familiar warmth that starts around your muscles. then WHAM, the molly kicks in and your heart starts pounding and you want to touch everything and stroke it. You WILL roll harder than you could ever imagine. I spent a good while just feeling my heart beating in my chest with my hands because it felt so god damn good.<br /><br />Best of both worlds. Next time I have the coin for it, I&#039;m buying more

				so i tried IV the first time this weekend. i went though .5 of No GenRx&#039;s heroin in 3 days (never doing heroin again or i would be hooked) and after that was gone and i saw this thread i said fuck it and IV&#039;d 70mg of sesampinos mdma. it was a crazy rush to say the least, never had such intense eye wiggles. but i honestly didnt like it for one reason. it felt more like a speed rush instead of lovey dovey mdma. and mdma is the only stimulant i like. so in short it was worth doing once but ill stick to eating my molly

				Sounds tempting, but I&#039;m trying to avoid the needle since I quit heroin. I feel like shooting anything may bring back desire to start again.

				A word of caution first hand:<br /><br />I recently began IV&#039;ing MDMA and M1 and found the rush most incredibly habit forming. Be very careful. Maybe this is just a thing with me? However, IV MDMA will have you injecting every 20 minutes till you run out.<br /><br />This is not a habit I will continue. Be careful. This habbit has similar dangers as injecting any other stimulant.&nbsp;

				I recently got some M1, and last night I did 200mg rectally, and then 50mg IV when I was peaking from the rectal dose, and then another 200mg rectal dose, over a period of two hours. It was really pretty amazing. Later in the week, I think I&#039;ll try starting off with 75mg IV, and then 175mg rectal.<br /><br />The only problem I had was after the second rectal dose started to kick in, I started getting a pretty bad headache, so I took some aspirin, and laid down for a while. I felt fine after about 20 minutes, then I went outside to smoke my hookah for a while.
