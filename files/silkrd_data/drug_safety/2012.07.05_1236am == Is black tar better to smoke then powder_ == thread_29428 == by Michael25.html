				I received some black tar H and some brown powder H. I only smoke it on foil. When I smoked the black tar I could get a pretty good buzz, but when I smoked the powder H nothing. I mean the taste was just fishy and that was it. Could it have been a bad batch you think? It doesn&#039;t even have a particular smell. Curious, since I don&#039;t want to waste any money on powder that has no affect on me.<br /><br />

				My personal opinion is that Smoking either Tar or Powder is a Waste. I tried both these types of Heroin, powdered and Tar as well as every possible ROA. Plugging, smoking, IV&#039;ing, IM and snorting. The best Route of Administration for Tar is Nasally. Prep your Tar as though you were going to shoot it, run it through Cotton or Wheel Filter and the &quot;Drip&quot; about 5 Drops into each Nostril. It will give you a superior buzz to that of Smoking it. If it&#039;s too Alkaline, it may Sting. To reduce the Sting, add a few drops of Apple Cider Vinegar. Not plain Vinegar. You will eventually find a happy ground where the Apple Cider will reduce the high Alkaline and wont sting. Plugging is also a good way. Hope this helps cause if your Not Shooting, DONT ever start!<br /><br />oppyate

				+1 to oppyate, if you don&#039;t shoot, don&#039;t start. Luckily for me, the first time I went IV, it was shit dope that ave me a headache, so I never did it again. Been tempted to, with some of the goods around here, but I decided to just let that bit of self-destructive curiosity go. As for smoking heroin, I too have found that tar smokes much better than powder, and doesn&#039;t taste as harsh either, as counterintuitive as that might seem. And if you do it right, not much is wasted; it just takes practice. The nasal spray method is a good one too, though, and very inconspicuous.

				i cant speak for smoking powder H but smoking tar is shit. it doesnt seem to get me high at all. it just seems like a big waste IMO. on the other hand Smoking Oxys is amazing. you can smoke the original OC&#039;s and the Roxys. they both taste great, smoke great, and give you a really good high. im surprised that not more people mention it around here.
