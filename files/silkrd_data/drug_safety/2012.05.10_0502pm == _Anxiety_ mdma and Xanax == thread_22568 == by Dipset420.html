				O.k. I&#039;m getting older and experience anxiety pretty bad from most drugs anymore.&nbsp; The only thing I can take worry free is Opiates and Benzos.&nbsp; (cant even smoke weed anymore)&nbsp; But I really, really, want to roll again but dont want to get all worked up on the come up.&nbsp; Has anybody ate a bar or two of xanax before rolling?&nbsp; And if so are there any dangerous effects?&nbsp; I know opiates and benzos are super dangerous and I can eat 4mg of xanax and shoot a shit load of dope or eat methadone and no problems, but I have experience with mixing those and not with mixing benzos and mdma.&nbsp; Ive never fell out once while using heroin off and on for over 12 years now.&nbsp; <br />Thanks to anyone who can give some input.<br />Peace

				xanax will kil lyour roll. stack with opi&#039;s or barbs. works for me lol<br /><br />phenobarbital at the tail end of a mescalin/tma-2 chimpout really helped calm me the fuck down... can&#039;t attest as to whether it would be effective in calming you down without killing the trip though. i think it would be ok... more research must be conducted!

				I also get anxiety now from drugs which is sad because I can&#039;t even enjoy the ganj anymore&nbsp; :&#039;(, but when it comes to good clean MDMA I do just fine. I can&#039;t really go over 100mg though if it&#039;s good MDMA because then I&#039;ll get anxious but in small doses I roll just fine so I would suggest trying small doses and upping it until you find your sweet spot because mixing a benzo with mdma would be a waste. I took about 200mg of MDMA once because I was at a festival and I was rolling pretty hard and getting a bit anxious so I took a .25mg xanax and it took away the anxiety but I feel like it brought my roll back down to the 100-115mg mark.

				GHB or 1,4b ... goes really well with MDMA and will take care of your anxiety as well as ease the body load.

				Wow thanks guys, great info... Delta I hear ya about the herb, its a bitch not being able to smoke.&nbsp; I get like tripping from the tiniest amounts, but if I eat a bar I can smoke several joints and enjoy the stone with out the effects that I would get if I didn&#039;t take a benzo.&nbsp; God getting old sucks.
