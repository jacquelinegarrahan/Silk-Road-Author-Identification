				I find my sweet spot dose is around 150 mgs, which seems to be a little lower than most peoples from what I&#039;ve read. It&#039;s speedier than MDMA in my experience, while you get a little bit of the happy feeling it&#039;s not overwhelming or anything like that. It only lasts a few hours, and you don&#039;t feel as worn out the next day. I really love it for times when I&#039;ve got something to do and can&#039;t spend the whole next day recovering.

				BK-MDMA.<br /><br />Love it. <br /><br />Yes it&#039;s 1/3 the serotonin release of MDMA......so I usually have 180mg wrapped up in tissue paper and swallow.&nbsp; Followed up by a booster of 80mg an hour later.<br /><br />It takes you to the window of love in a very gentle way.....but doesn&#039;t pull you through it like MDMA. <br /><br />It&#039;s more of an anti depressant feeling. ...empathy is there, as are is a feeling of well being and control.&nbsp; For me it&#039;s like MDMA&#039;s little sister. .....kind and gentle. <br /><br />Everyone, whom I know that has had it loves it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go having top up after top up as the happy feelings tend to decrease after a while and a more jittery speedy feeling emerges. This can make sleep somewhat difficult. <br /><br />Oh, as a side issue it&#039;s an amazing sexual stimulant. .....males &amp; femmes! <br /><br />So enjoy and if you have time let us know how it went for you.

				At low doses (&lt;50mg) it can be used as a cognitive enhancer, and when taken with piracetam the effects are striking. Less of an anti-serotonin effect than MDMA, but it&#039;s still there; you&#039;ll feel like you&#039;re breathing deeper, and your movements will be more fluid.

				Hey guys, a buddy recently got alot of &#039;MDMA&#039; that i suspect is in fact methylone. Im having trouble finding a vendor that can ship to me in the US that has marquis tests. Can any one comment on the general look of M1 crystals, or the smell?<br /><br />&nbsp;This stuff is small (some being 10mg some being 500mg) rocks, that are all very consistent looking, like all pretty smooth pebbles, it has a strange color to it. Kind of see through crystals, but kind of yellowish tan. It smells almost of banana&#039;s or some kind of hand soap. <br /><br />&nbsp;I only ask because ive seen thousands of grams of MDMA in my time, and nothing ive ever seen has looked like this stuff. The fact that the average dose of this stuff this guy and his friends take is like 200mg+. <br /><br />&nbsp;I can upload a picture if necessary. thanks guys.&nbsp;

In my experience, only a select few practice this and it&#039;s really more common on forums etc, but in &quot;real life&quot; most people just pop off and the rules go out the window. For binging, M1 is superior. You can literally stay high on it for days, the doses are not as diminished as MDMA because M1 is much easier on the serotonin. It is also likely less neurotoxic and much safer to use regularly than MDMA, imo. M1 can be superior to MDMA in that it doesn&#039;t floor people quite like you will see them melt on MDMA, which makes it more functional if you are not interested in letting the world know you are sweating and rolling your nuts off and looking like a general E tard. Not that you don&#039;t see some MDMA users that are total pros at keeping cool. People often use bk-mdma as a direct replacement for MDMA which would certainly make sense, but often times people are just like, well was it as &quot;good&quot; as mdma and end up taking large doses of M1 to mirror the effects of mdma. you will see reports of people doing 300-500mg starter doses because the focus is on rolling your nuts off (MDMA) and not getting it&#039;s slightly weaker cousin, methylone. It&#039;s important to just let each substance stand alone and not necc characterize it by how it compares to another drug.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />YES. This exactly. Methylone is a great drug for different reasons than why MDMA is a great drug. I always thought of methylone as a more chill, laid back kinda drug, perfect for a lounging, bonding kinda experience. MDMA is more of a &quot;trip&quot; of love, which can actually provide some really important insights to people about the way they interact with others. You *could* say that methylone is MDMA-lite, but it really isn&#039;t they are totally different drugs and should be treated as such.
