				I&#039;m trying to build a little stash up for the summer and was just hoping someone could offer some advice about storage.<br /><br />Specifically I&#039;m wondering about:<br /><br />Valium and modafinil: would these degrade at all if I stored them out of their packaging and in pill boxes? It&#039;s not a big deal really but modafinil especially comes in annoying foil wrapping which messes up my OCD-like storage habits.<br /><br />Synthetic mescaline: is it true that this can last almost indefinitely? At the moment I&#039;ve got in kept in a box full of those silica drying sachets things and I don&#039;t have time for a full trip yet<br /><br />LSD: I&#039;ve had some of this for about a year just kept in a drawer, I&#039;m guessing this probably has degraded somewhat?<br /><br />Thank you in advance, wonderful community :)

				I always keep my stash in a sealed container opaque to light. In the bottom I always keep a dessicant pack to absorb moisture. I just keep the dessicant from a bottle of Tylenol or something.

				Everything you mentioned can be successfully stored at room temperature (20-25*C), so you can keep it all together if you wish.<br /><br />The pills can be stored almost however you desire: most of the chemical is locked up inside the pill away from light and air, and those drugs are relatively stable anyway.&nbsp; Putting them in an air/light-tight container would be a step up.<br /><br />It is true that mescaline is quite stable.&nbsp; You could just leave it as a powder in a zip baggie if you wish.&nbsp; As before, air/light-tight can&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; I like dosing it out into gel caps and putting them in a medicine bottle, zip baggie, or mason jar.<br /><br />LSD is the most sensitive chemical listed by far.&nbsp; As I&#039;m sure you know, it&#039;s degraded easily by light, heat, and air.&nbsp; The best way to store it is air/light-tight somewhere cool.&nbsp; The &quot;best&quot; way to do that, according to most LSD enthusiasts, is to wrap it in aluminum foil, put it in something small and air-tight, and put it in the freezer (or refrigerator).&nbsp; This is definitely effective.&nbsp; <br />However, I disagree that blotter stored in a drawer for a year is &quot;most likely inactive;&quot; it might be, but depending on exactly how it was stored, it could still be about as potent as when it was purchased.&nbsp; I have successfully kept blotter at room-temperature (simply wrapped in foil and put between the pages of a heavy book) for over three years, and have heard many reports of this method standing up to a decade of storage with no noticeable loss in potency.&nbsp; 20-25*C is not very hot, when it comes down to it.<br />So OP, depending on which side of OCD you&#039;re on (keep all the drugs stored together, or store things as &quot;optimally&quot; as possible?), you have a choice to make! :D

				I know LSD won&#039;t degrade insanely fast like common belief, but a whole year is a long time for LSD to be sitting in a drawer? And most likely constant opening and closing so light keeps getting in and what not. Idk just in my opinion its probably inactive or really close. Or an RC and he will trip balls haha<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

At least that&#039;s what happens in my drawers, lol. Funny to clean it out like once every 2-3 years ;D

				In my personal experience, LSD is a lot less sensitive than people make it out to be.<br /><br />Put LSD in foil and hide it in between slices of cheese in your refrigerator or freezer.
