				i ordered a white question from a vendor and I just had a quick question about it. Around my town the molly is more on the meth side and is less potent. A .5 gets me a meh roll. I had ordered a .1&nbsp; 2 weeks back and holy fuck that shit got me hard. Im going to a concert in 6 days. So would I still have a good roll? It&#039;s been 26 days since my last roll.

				You will be fine.<br /><br />Just make sure you sleep well and eat right for the next 6 days.&nbsp; You want to be physically ready to have a lot of fun and keep up with the crowd.

				its optimal to wait atleast a month between rolls but after a week the magic returns for me even though the side effects of the second one is increased i personally have found that 3 weeks feels the same as waiting 2 months but im not shure what that is doing to my mind in quick sucession. gues im just enjoying it while im young probly wont do mdma after this year.

				Ive rolled 3 days in a row at festivals and it will be fine if you eat right, sleep and take some vitamins (i always take a multivitamin, b-complex and vitamin c after rolling. I use 5-htp during multi day festivals after as well. (make sure you take it atleast 8 hours before taking MDMA.<br /><br />You should be fine, you can start pre loading with 5-htp and taking multivitamins to help as well. The day of the concert try to eat light and healthy (fruits and veggies are besT).

It was good but not the best and it was supposed to be a strong 220mg press. I just got a red question mark from the SR and it looks different (bigger and has two scores on the back instead of nothing). So maybe the first question mark I got was not the dutch press.

That&#039;s about when I&#039;m peaking from what I&#039;ve eaten so it gives for a really intense roll. I&#039;ve never tried reds but I have some greens right now. I like to eat one then rail another over the course of 4 hours or so its really strong mdma so nomader how u do it u will roll hard. I love to rail x pills and I find that supertrips the best for it.
