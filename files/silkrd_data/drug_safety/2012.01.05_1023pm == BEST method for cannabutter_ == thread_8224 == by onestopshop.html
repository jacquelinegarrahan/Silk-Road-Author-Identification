				[please move if wrong thread but...]<br /><br />what&#039;s the best recipe for making cannabutter? when I mean best... I mean what method/recipe will extract me the MOST THC (and other intoxicating compounds!).<br /><br />I normally buy bulk of two types of weed (one premium, one homegrown/outdoor for the old school heads) , I use the trim from the premium as a tobacco substitute but have slowly been saving up the other trim for a few months now.<br /><br />anybody point me in the right direction? especially if folks have used a variety of cannabutter recipes and then eventually found &quot;THAT ONE&quot; that works for them best or is the most potent.<br /><br />ALSO!<br /><br />when I get my weed after a couple of hours of trimming and stalk removal my fingers get sticky as fuck, every-time I&#039;m washing my hands after a bagging up session I&#039;m thinking &quot;damn that&#039;s a waste of good finger hash&quot;.<br /><br />I was thinking if I wear latex gloves beforehand then at the end of the trimming session whack the gloves in the freezer would it be safe to scrape the resin off the gloves with a scalpel and smoke up the &quot;homemade handrubbed hash &quot;?<br /><br />cheers for any tips and pointers, I normally have 1oz-4oz of trim at any time so recipes for these quantities would be awesome.

				In terms of the best method for cannabutter I couldn&#039;t really help you much as every time I&#039;ve tried to make it it&#039;s ended in disaster (especially one time when me and a few mates were high on coke so sprinkled a weed-cake with coke instead of icing sugar then went off and forgot about it and accidentally left it in the oven for five hours.)<br /><br />Although I&#039;ve just placed an order with BashfulBetty for 20g of Cannabutter (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/12641), so that should make it a whole lot easier in the future. :D

				Don&#039;t know about canabutter, but I&#039;d be interested to see what you come up with since I am hoping to make some soon as well.<br /><br />On the glove point, I&#039;d be a bit careful scraping since it would be very easy to scrape bits of glove off as well. A better method would be to soak the gloves in ethanol or iso-propyl alcohol until the resin is off the gloves, then leave it to evaporate and get the resin that way. Make sure it is properly evaporated, so use as little amount as possible. Also IMPORTANT ensure you get powder free gloves whichever way you go.

				lol @ Atticus, you nutter! have had that happen before but that&#039;s cooking whilst stoned..always use the alarm on my phone to remind me when to take the bloomin thing out of the oven lol<br /><br />@ arutha ,cool , I was worried about scraping the bits of the glove off i thought freezing the glove would make the resin more flaky and easier to chip off?<br /><br />when you say make sure it&#039;s properly evaporated anyway of doing this or making sure as don&#039;t want to have any trace alcohol in the hash.<br /><br />cheers!

				Can somebody suggest a good approach when starting with hash? Can you just dump it in the butter, or do you need to decarb it first?

				been makin it for a LONG time. the goldfishluv rescipe (spelling???)<br /><br />i have had people give me back my brownies cause its too strong&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I use a heat gun and my bong ALL THE TIME. i save my vaped weed in a coffee cup (stems too). <br /><br />Once the coffee cup is full i melt 1 pound of butter in a sauce pan thats medium sized (on about 5/medium heat on the range dial) <br /><br />Add the cup of vaped herb (or real stuff)<br /><br />leave it on 5/medium heat for a min or 2<br /><br />Put a lid on the sauce pan<br /><br />reduce the heat to&nbsp; 2/low heat for 30 minutes<br /><br />then reduce to as low of heat as possiable for 2-9 hrs (depending on if you get too stoned and take a nap&nbsp; :)&nbsp; )<br /><br />take off the heat and get a mixing bowl to hold the butter<br /><br />use a metal strainer to filter the chunks (dont worry there is tons of THC in the butter)<br /><br />put in the fridge and wait till cooled<br /><br />Along the sides of the mixing bowl are the chunks that made it past the filter, scrap those out<br /><br />TA DA you have cannabutter

				Are you talking about cooking cannabis and dairy butter, or making a concentrate?<br /><br />Look into making bubble hash. Although there are lots of ways to make hash: I&#039;ve read about using a screen, a blender, a drum machine (I think Jorge Cervantes has a video about washing machine hash), and a bubble bag with micron pores. Or even nylons. Supposedly bubble hash is the best (it&#039;s called bubble hash because it bubbles when heated). The goal of making bubble hash is to save only the trichomes I think.<br /><br />Also, you should be eating that finger hash, or scraping it off and smoking it. For centuries, people have made hash by simply rubbing cannabis in between the palms of their hands (make sure your hands are clean). Or there&#039;s a story about &quot;goddess hash&quot; where naked women would walk through cannabis fields and the resin would stick to their body and pubic hair.<br /><br />THCA is in cannabis trichomes, and when it&#039;s burned it&#039;s decarboxylated and converted into the more psychoative form THC.<br /><br />Regarding heat and cannabis, another thread has this information:<br /><br />70 F, the most volatile terpenoids start to evaporate leaving a pungent odor<br />87 F, less volatile terpenoids start to evaporate leaving a more pungent odor<br />102 F, pretty much all terpenoids start to evaporate rapidly<br />122 F, the water molecule in THCA evaporates and THCA decarboxylates and is converted into THC<br />150 F, CBD melts and begins to evaporate<br />365 F, CBN boils<br />392 F, THC boils<br /><br />from here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7190.msg64535#msg64535<br /><br />So it would make sense that bubble hash bubbles because when a flame is applied, THC is boiling.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read elsewhere that it&#039;s been hypothesized that THC can act like sunscreen for cannabis. And supposedly THC can absorb UV light. If THCA turns into THC at 122 F, then the THC would absorb UV light and the plant would be protected from radiation. (Although maybe the UV light especially UVB is just degrading the THC). Also, I&#039;ve read that precursors of THC in the plant have antimicrobial properties.

				This is way I have usually done it. Bring a pot of water to a boil, throw in 2 sticks of butter and 1/4 of ground bud. Let it simmer for a few hours. Let it cool for a little bit and pour the container into a tupperware and put it into the fridge. The butter/THC/actives will form a solid layer on top of the water, pour the water out. You have cannabutter. Some people will pour the water/butter through a coffee filter to get rid of the plant matter this is just a personal preference.

				I would recommend vacuum distillation. You can start with any solvent and end up with a pile of decent hash, or distill the THC itself and end up with a virtually pure product. The glassware is not expensive and with practice you can go from start to finish in less than a day.

As far as I am aware as well since the active stuff in weed are oils, potent weed will float on water but once everything is extracted it will sink. This will have several uses; while you are cooking, you will know when you have heated for long enough to extract everything. And secondly, as it cool the weed should sink while the butter stays on top so you won&#039;t actually need to separate.<br /><br /><br />One question on cooking - how obvious is the smell in the kitchen going to be? And how long will it stay around?
