				Hello ladies and gents, I was wondering if there is a big difference between speed and cocaine.<br /><br />I am asking as I am doing cocaine more or less every weekend, the problem is that coke is too expensive on the streets as well as on SR. Speed is obviously cheaper but I&#039;m wondering if its more harmful than cocaine and if the feeling is much more different.<br /><br />It might seem like a retarded question but I never did speed so don&#039;t start throwing your sarcasm at me.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.

				speed is less euphoric but more stimulating than coke...<br />the effects of speed also last longer than coke...<br />speed makes you feel productive...<br />coke makes you feel like a douchebag...

				This info can be easily found on erowid and similar sites, but I will summarize the differences for you as I perceive them :)<br />Health and safety:<br />I would say cocaine is less dirty than speed. Especially if we are talking about low-purity, street-grade speed. Pharmaceutical amphetamine/d-amphetamine are something different. I would say that you are putting less shit in your body with cocaine. On the other hand, cocaine is more damaging to your heart and the whole cardiovascular system. Anyways, both are hardcore CNS stimulants, so it is difficult to clearly state which one is more harmful.<br /><br />The effects:<br />Cocaine is more of a mental high, whereas speed has a lot of nervous body energy and jitters. Speed is barely euphoric at all and if you want something similar to cocaine, speed is definitely NOT your best bet. Have you thought about methamphetamine? It is definitely more euphoric than amphetamine and IMO, resembles the cocaine feeling a lot more. <br /><br />Still, this is only my opinion from my experience and everyone reacts differently. For example, I don&#039;t like any stimulant. I have dabbled with amphs, meth, some RCs and the whole phenethylamine group is a big NO for my mind and my body. I thought cocaine would be different, but it wasn&#039;t. Stay safe.
