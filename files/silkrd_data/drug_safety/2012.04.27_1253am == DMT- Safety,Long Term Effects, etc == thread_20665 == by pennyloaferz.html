				I have tried Dmt several times and have loved it-&nbsp; I understand theres always the possibility of a bad trip (never experienced one with deemsters, but i know its always possible) and I was talking to a friend in the medical field today about doing it and she was like id do it but its really bad for your brain.&nbsp; and i said I dont think thats necessarily true.&nbsp; and shes like uh yea it messes with brain chemicals and shit- im in the medical feild and therefore know more than you about all types of shit.&nbsp; So I did about 25 minutes of online research- and recieved just about nothing to support this.<br /><br />So I ask you my friends of the drug world- what are the long term side effects, is there negative side effects like brain damage that can occur from DMT and so on?&nbsp; I know the smoke is harsh and that tripping and general can produce some mental things if you abuse it, but does DMT eat up your brain, fuck your shit up or whatever.&nbsp; Im usually not all about proving my point, but she really made a point to try and get in my face about it without any room for debate so I am now really interested in setting this straight.&nbsp; <br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; ;D

				your friend sounds like a know-it-all<br /><br />dmt doesn&#039;t cause brain damage, thats ridiculous...its a simple tryptamine.&nbsp; there&#039;s a whole mess of tryptamines running around your brain all day every day.<br /><br />it can be dangerous, but on a psychological level.&nbsp; ask your friend to cite a study that suggests possibility of brain damage; i guarantee she can&#039;t.&nbsp; matter of fact, ask your friend to cite ANY study she has actually read on DMT.&nbsp; has she even heard of Dr. Strassman&#039;s studies?

				dmt is an endogenous neurotransmitter. u really dont wanna treat it as a recreational drug though. itll bite you one day if you treat it that way. check out dmt-nexus.me/forum on the clearnet. dmt gurus reside there, loads of information too.

				DMT is very safe. I&#039;ve been smoking regularly for over 10 years and the only side effects have been happiness, increased brain function, and a deep understanding and emphatic connection to the world and it&#039;s creatures. It was even approved by the FDA for the Straussman studies. Your friend is severely misinformed.

				Psychedelics are being reexamined in the medical field. http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/186/6/457.short<br /><br />Medicine is largely at the mercy of legal authorities and governing bodies. Regardless of therapeutic benefit your doctor can&#039;t just had out illegal substances. <br /><br />This might be what your friend was refering too: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16342002<br />I still feel she is misinformed - Albert Hoffman himself said that psychedelics in the hands of inexperienced users in the wrong setting could have profound negative effects on their ego, but their potential benefits in certain individuals outweighs the risks.

				For anyone with experience using oil burner pipes, how can I tell when the material is expended? It&#039;s not as easy as with MJ, where you know there is nothing left when the ash turns white.

				Bad trips usually teach you the most about yourself. I&#039;m not sure if this is true about DMT but it definitely is for other tryptamines. As long as you aren&#039;t a physical harm to yourself or others, bad trips are just unpleasant and somewhat difficult to shake for a day at most unless you are emotionally fragile initially going into the experience. Psychedelics are my absolute favorite class of drugs.

				^ My first experience with a high dose of shrooms ended in a bad trip. I was having the time of my life, and in my excitement started talking about it to someone who ended up saying something that really freaked me the fuck out. It was goddamn terrifying at the time, and I was just looking at videos and shit to try to calm myself down. A friend sent me the music video for &quot;staying alive&quot; by the bee gees. The way they kept popping out of the corners, the way their heads seemed to be shrinking and the ridiculous whiteness of their teeth scared the shit out of me, I was just curled up in the fetal position listening to this song and going completely insane.<br /><br />I learned from that experience that even the worst of bad trips makes for a hilarious and fun memory.

				After reading all this, I&#039;m still not 100% sure how to smoke DMT, though I&#039;ve given my first gram of n,n-DMT a couple tries so far (sounds, visuals, strange beings, no breakthrough yet - too afraid).<br /><br />It is said everywhere that DMT is very fragile molecule and can be easily destroyed by fire, oxidation, etc. It is said that you can&#039;t heat it up with flame directly and rather need to have hot air from the flame rushing through to evaporate it gently. My sources on this are Erowid and various DMT how-tos floating around.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;ve done so far (evaporating DMT in glass pipe by rushing hot air through it), and the resulting smoke wasn&#039;t so rough on the lungs, but also the experience wasn&#039;t as overwhelming as rough smoke would&#039;ve been (probably for the better since I&#039;m new to it). I guess if I want a real breakthrough, I need to heat it up a bit more (??). I&#039;m afraid to damage the DMT molecules by fire.<br /><br />The guy who&#039;s saying he smoked the black resin left over after smoking - I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s even DMT anymore. Could it be some other chemical by that point?<br /><br />As far as the health effects of DMT, I&#039;ve read up as much as there is available and haven&#039;t seen a single article claiming any sort of damage to the brain. However, the psychological risk is real, and I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s not ideal on the lungs (thought I&#039;ve never heard of anyone claim DMT is carcinogenic).
