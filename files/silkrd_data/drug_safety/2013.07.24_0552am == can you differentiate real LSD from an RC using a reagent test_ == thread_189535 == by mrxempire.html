				I was wondering if you could tell real LSD from RC&#039;s by using one of the drug testing kits that they sell at music festivals. I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re reagent tests. I told my friend that I was bringing 25 hits of SR LSD to a music festival that we are attending in a couple days. He acted very suspicious and wanted to make sure they were not RC&#039;s. Since I bought from one of the highest ranked vendors, I&#039;m pretty much certain that it is real LSD. I told him that if he honestly didn&#039;t believe me, we could test one of the hits at the festival when we got there. He told me that the testing kits don&#039;t tell the difference between real LSD and fake LSD. Is this true?

If they couldn&#039;t do this then they wouldn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />I recommend an Ehrlich test kit, you can buy one on silk road if you want to.

				I use Ehrlich test from Bunk Police.&nbsp; It clearly can differentiate from different types of RC&#039;s.....Just remember, purple is a beautiful color.

				Ehrlich can&#039;t differentiate between ergotamines and tryptamines, so any of those highly potent joints will fit and appear to be real to the test.&nbsp; I&#039;m positive 5-meo-amt and 5-meo-mipt fit on blotter easily anyone think of any others?&nbsp;

				If you know correct blotter sizes, the 5-MEO&#039;s will take a larger blotter to fit on.&nbsp; Just by looking at it, should throw warning signs up.&nbsp; But using the Ehrlich, if it doesn&#039;t go Pink--&gt;Light Purple--&gt;Dark Purple, then it&#039;s most likely an RC from the 25- family.

				Just beacause something is on blotter doesn&#039;t mean its &#039;fake&#039; LSD or trying to be passed as fake LSD.<br />Many RC&#039;s are nothing even close to an LSD trip, even those who have never had LSD could tell that certain RC&#039;s are not LSD<br />so ask your friend what RC he thinks it might be just for shits and giggles...if its from a trusted vendor on SR that&#039;s good enough for me.

				These quick tests should be taken off the market where they are used as evidence. <br /><br />Police often treat them as definitive proof some sample contains the active substance the test was developed for. Realistically it is possible to create substances that these tests will show positive for, while the substances in them are not banned nor psychoactive. <br /><br />The point of doing so would be to demonstrate that the tests used are actually not reliable to the point where a positive test result would be evidence enough to give a search warrant. <br /><br /><br />
