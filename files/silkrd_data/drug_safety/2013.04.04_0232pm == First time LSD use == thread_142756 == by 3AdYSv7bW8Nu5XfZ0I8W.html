				Hi guys, i just came by to get some advice on the safest way to try out LSD for the first time.<br /><br />So we&#039;ve got 2 people, neither ever tried LSD, both tried weed, and two LSD tabs/bottlers which are at least 110ug according to seller (he claims &quot;Dutch lab tested 120-150 ug&quot;). How do we use them? Just put them under our tongue and they&#039;ll dissolve? On the tongue? On the forehead and dance around? We&#039;re really clueless.<br /><br />Now i see people recommend to trip together and on the other hand&nbsp; they recommend a trip sitter.<br />If it&#039;s just the two of us, should we trip in turns? That sounds like the logical thing to do to me.<br /><br />I saw the guidelines SpeedCrunch offered and i&#039;ll be sure to follow them:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">#1 Keep sharp objects out of reach in rooms where you will be tripping<br />#2 Unplug your phone + mobile<br />#3 Don&#039;t go out side in public on your first trip (I wanted to do this but knew it would be a bad idea if I did)<br />#4 Make sure all your doors are locked windows closed<br />#5 Keep music volume at a reasonable level don&#039;t want people coming over complaining<br />#6 Keep benzos handy. It wont abort the trip but may calm you down if you get to over stimulated or paranoid.<br /><br />I just want to say from my first LSD experience I think the most important part about having a good trip is <br /><br />#1 be in a Good/Happy mood this is a must!<br />#2 be excited about the trip!<br />#3 remember it&#039;s just a drug it&#039;s not going to kill you<br />#4 What ever happens your going to be ok<br />#5 You are not in control accept this don&#039;t let it scare you – The more you try to control the visuals the more scary it gets. Just let the visuals&nbsp; /breath/flow<br />#6 Once you&#039;ve taken the tab there is no turning back! You must accept this</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can anyone write a quick guide to the trip sitter? Since neither of us ever done LSD, we don&#039;t really know what to expect and how to handle any issues that might come up..

				you put the tab against your gum and leave it there for as long as you&#039;d like. lsd is active orally, it just hits faster if you take it buccally (between the cheek and gums). do yourself a favor and read this before you trip: http://deoxy.org/psyexp.htm

				Google is your friend. But literally- put the paper on your tongue and hold it there. It might dissolve, it might not. Five minutes is generally considered good. I just keep it on there for as long as I can before I inevitably accidentally swallow it, or begin to feel symptoms.<br /><br />Some people recommend placing it under the tongue instead of over, but I find this annoying.<br /><br />In terms of mental state– My honest advice is to not worry about it. Don&#039;t clumsily take LSD on a day when you&#039;ve been down or arguing a lot- but don&#039;t worry about having a bad trip, or else it&#039;ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br /><br />First time I took LSD, I&#039;d been incredibly depressed for years, albeit off any SSRI/SNRI. On the day of, I just tried to be happy and think about positive things; despite my depression I had a phenomenal trip. Don&#039;t worry!
