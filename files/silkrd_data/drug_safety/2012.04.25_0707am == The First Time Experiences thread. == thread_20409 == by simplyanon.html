				Title says it all :) I was looking for experiences from people on the forums, and could only find people who have been doing it for a while saying anything. As it was my first time, I didn&#039;t trust their dosages or effects to be the same.<br /><br />Tried K today. Like, not too long ago actually. (3 bumps of 20mg)<br /><br />I&#039;m a pretty big guy, so I did 3 instead of 2, alternating nostrils. RLR. <br /><br />I felt/feel amazing. For a while, I had some music playing, and I just closed my eyes and bobbed to the music. I felt so...happy. I then took a walk around the block, and wow, the breeze and the sounds and everything just relaxed the shit outta me. After my walk, I got back to music. Danced by myself for a bit, then sat down and relaxed. After a bit I started feeling like I do now. More relaxed than usual, and still have an overbearing appreciation for music. :) Definitely a great experience. Happy I have more.

				A great experience. I feel like I&#039;ve been missin out.<br /><br />Never tried MXE. But there is a VERY long list of things for me to try at least once. Its on it. Lol.<br /><br />Replacing alcoholism by experimenting with a multitude of other drugs? Sure, why not.

				IMO MXE is just a shit version of K. No happiness, no inner child, no silliness and lasts way too long. Stick with K.

I don&#039;t and will never understand how some people think MXE is better than K, it doesn&#039;t even come close in my opinion. When I do K it makes you feel like a kid exploring everything that&#039;s new. Makes you feel innocent again. MXE just put me in a box I wanted to not be in. <br /><br />

				Well I was hoping to have a first time MDMA experience on here by now, but with all of the Tony drama it seems it will be a little while before I will be able to share. I did recently make an order from SKYY, so hopefully I will be able to share in a couple of weeks.

But luckily I ordered right before he announced his 4/20 sale, otherwise I probably would have wasted more. It may be a blessing in disguise though. Having SKYY&#039;s pink stars as my first experience should be AMAZING! Tony&#039;s MDMA got some mixed reviews, and I would have been disappointed if everything wasn&#039;t perfect for my first experience.

				If it&#039;s your first time then I have to say congrats, I wish I could have my first time again. Such a magical experience. <br /><br />I have done Mandy for years so I suggest you make sure you are with a few good friends and I&#039;d advice your first time you just drink water instead of mixing it with alcohol. I still rarely drink on Mandy now. Make sure you are in a comfortable setting and you should be in for the best experience of your life! <br /><br />Good luck mate, sure it will be a blast! :)

				i remember my first time with weed. Smoked a small amount when i was 16. just remember feeling all dreamy and euphoric, laid in bed for about 3hours just zoning out and enjoying life :). Cant smoke that stuff anymore though, to many bad experiences with it. Oh how i miss it though!&nbsp;

				Haha I remember my first time smoking weed.&nbsp; My buddy thought it&#039;d be entertaining to have me hit his homemade gravity bong.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; I thought I was going to die. My first experience with mxe ended in God coming to me as the cylon form of Optimus Prime, morphing into a bobcat tractor and lifting up the asphalt in front of me which he said was a metaphor for my skin, so he could show me my soul was turning to tar.&nbsp; Offering God a foily? Officially crossed off my bucket list.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />I started a first trip journal way back when.&nbsp; It&#039;s kinda cool to look back on and see what it was like and how each drug has changed as I&#039;ve used it more.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				I think most people who have done MDMA will have had a pretty amazing experience for their first roll.<br /><br />My first time was actually a dud pill, second one I got from the same guy (for some reason....) dropped a single one.<br /><br />After 2 hours I was barely feeling anything...figured they were crappy as well so dropped another so I could at least &quot;see what all the fuss was about&quot;.<br /><br />10 mins later the first one kicked in so hard I felt like someone had smashed me in the face.....so intensely amazing. (Turns out the pills were actually the strongest going around at the time)<br /><br />Must have been a total gurning mess in the club cause people kept asking me for pills haha. <br /><br />I remember just feeling so amazing that I couldnt be bothered doing anything at all because just &quot;being&quot; was so fun. Never hit a really messy or &#039;feeling fucked up&#039; zone though.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had another experience like this and likely never will. I think that&#039;s one of the biggest issues with most drugs, you will rarely get an experience as good as the first few and its so tempting to keep trying.
