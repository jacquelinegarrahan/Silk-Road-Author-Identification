				Some of the drug veterans may crack up at me for even posting this, but I&#039;d really like some answers about this.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been having schizophrenia-like symptoms while being high. Not all of the indicators are there, but there are enough to make me weary. <br /><br />THC increases mental activity, and for people already at risk for schizo, this increases the chances of it popping up.&nbsp; CBD helps you chill the fuck out.<br /><br />I would just like to know if there are any vendors selling marijuana with high CBD content or medical grade marijuana. Shipping to Australia.<br /><br />Thank you. ♥<br /><br />edit: this might be in the wrong forum. &gt;_&lt; I&#039;ve placed it in drug safety because that&#039;s what it is to me. lol

				Ive got no experience with this myself, but i believe i read somewhere you can use vaporisers to burn at the optimum temperature to release more THC or CBD.<br />But this equipment is kinda pricey.<br />The best advice for you is to stop smoking tbh. <br />I used a lot of MDMA, speed and cannabis for years and it ended with me having a psychotic episode. <br />There&#039;s no real recovery after this, although i can say i haven&#039;t had any acute symptoms in quite a while, there&#039;s a certain level of paranoia that has never subsided.<br />The road to this semi recovery is pretty long, i had a very bad depression for well over a year, having to fight suicidal thoughts along the way. Mind you i wasnt in therapy at the time, i tried to fight it off myself.<br />My housedoctor did prescribe me with an antipsycothic though, i hated these pills. I didnt feel (myself) anymore, i was tired to the point i needed 14hours of sleep every day. I gained alot of weight fast, despite eating to little, i couldnt find the energy to cook or shop. And i also blaimed the pills for the terrible depression i was in, but my doctors now say thats normal after an episode and i would have had one anyway.<br />There&#039;s also the fear of it returning, which from what i&#039;ve learned from my doctors is more likely then not. They also tell me with each new epsisode my baseline level of comfort will deteriarate and the posibility for a new episode will increase. So they strongly advice me never to take drugs anymore, something i periodicly ignore hence me being here lol :-) . <br />My personal view is that cannabis of all the drugs i abused had to most impact, both short term and long term. I always did and will get very paranoid of others when high on weed and could only get high in a private setting with people i knew a long time but preferably alone.<br /><br />I only use a couple of times a year now. My Bday and new years eve are very hard to stay clean. I stopped using canabis, but sometimes i&#039;ll smoke some hash. Not the strong stuff, low quality soapbar is strong enough for me. I&#039;m looking for that mild energetic head high, i get 0 paranoia with that. In fact it relaxes me, like a benzo would. So you could try switching to hash, but if you&#039;re&nbsp; diehard heavy weed smoker like i was. it will not fullfill your needs when you first try it.<br /><br />Keep save dude<br /><br />PS: i was recently browsing a seedshop and they sold seeds that were advertised for having a 50/50 THC/CDB content. Both at 5%. Caught my attention to, ide love to try this strain once. I didnt bookmark, but i&#039;ll try if i can find it again.

				I&#039;d be more inclined to say that, whilst yes you are correct on the face of it regarding THC being the thing that gets you high, CBD mellowing - but I&#039;d certainly say the choice of strain, particularly whether it was an Indica, Sativa, or combination of the two - Hybrid - that has the greatest effect on the mental state, regarding paranoia and schizophrenia. <br /><br />Can I ask, if you don&#039;t mind answering, what&#039;s your age? Schizo - like symptoms are more likely at earlier ages when exposed to cannabis use. However, having said this, it&#039;s also important to note that Cannabis and Schizophrenia don&#039;t have a positive correlation - ie - increase in number of cannabis users has not lead to an increase in number of schizophrenic patients. <br /><br />If you want something to chill you out, I&#039;d certainly recommend an Indica - Dominant Hybrid. I&#039;ve recently had some Purple Kush and that&#039;s a 100% Indica, giving extreme couchlock, munchies and puts you to bed. You won&#039;t really want to do much with that strain. <br />On the other hand, Jack Herer, something else I&#039;ve had recently (both coincidentally off Canadian seller, MrOuid) is almost 100% Sativa I believe, which is very clear-headed, thought provoking and euphoric. <br /><br />It&#039;s also important to note that the effects from individual strains can differ depending on the quality of the grow, conditions, etc. <br /><br />See, there&#039;s a lot to consider from a technical and scientific standpoint. But I&#039;d definitely try something that&#039;s Indica leaning and report back.

				Thank you all for your replies!<br /><br />I will give recreational smoking a go i guess... especially since mj gets me in the zone like nothing else (except psychedelics, but that&#039;s a completely different story).<br /><br />More than anything, I suspect that this was brought on from misuse of rc&#039;s so theres something to focus on for everyone else that wants to avoid this.<br /><br />I&#039;m not that old... I&#039;m 19. I started smoking small-medium quantities of cannabis every few hours because I realised it improved every other aspect of my life. Some of the benefits have become frequent even when I&#039;m not buzzed (better relationship with family, better social awareness) but it sucks that I may have to quit smoking because it&#039;s so hard to get CBD-containing strains.<br /><br />As marijuana is a mild-psychedelic (sativa-dominant strains), I am giving meditation a try-- it does help trippers in having better experiences with more peace-of-mind. Set and setting may also have had an impact on it, as I work in a real shit place... I will see, and return to this thread with results.<br /><br />samuelkane... That sucks :( Vaporizers do work, but you need a mate who can smoke all of that THC and leave you with the mind-numbing CBD. I found an article with some interesting information here: https://www.greenpassion.org/index.php?/topic/22485-want-cbd-not-thc/<br />As for your history of use, it reminds me of my own misadventures with cannabis: trip like nothing else and smoke a couple of joints. I think some of us are just predisposed to getting mind-fucked by the intense synergy that cannabis provides.<br /><br />adios ♥

				I think drugs screwed us all up a little bit.. I think that partaking in online drug buying would be proof enough that we all have some kind of mental issues....lol.. just kidding... actually maybe i believe that in some part of my head... anyways.. back to the subject at hand..... I offer a Sativa strong bud that I think would work just fine for what your looking for...<br /><br />Its called jeanguy....I currently only ship to canada and the usa but you might be able to find a re-mailer that can get the product to you....<br /><br />You should check it out!!!<br /><br />Hope this info helps!

				Hi Sundhara.<br /><br />Try the seller &quot;elk&quot; as you are from Australia, his Blue Cheese is great and my impression after smoking was that it had a noticeable CBD content. <br /><br />The strain is listed as having 1.3 % CBD but every plant varies so could be more or less. <br /><br />I presume it had a solid CBD content, as before trying I smoked a quarter of my usual homegrown bush weed which renders you quite dazed and confused, after one hit of this Blue Cheese I was returned to baseline, complete clarity restored, it had an energizing effect as well.<br /><br />CBD has antipsychotic, antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects that could be unnoticeable to those who do not have these tendencies, but is powerful enough to mitigate the effects of THC.<br /><br />On a sidenote, testing of the strain Cannatonic had considerable variation in CBD to THC, in some samples there was roughly 20% THC and 1% CBD, while another plant from the same seed batch had the reverse 20% CBD and 1% THC. (Sorry I can&#039;t attach the analysis sheet as the file is too large).<br /><br />Carlos.

				elk is one of my favourite vendors! :D He always goes out of his way to ensure a happy customer.<br /><br />However, since most of what I&#039;ve been smoking is a mix of his cheese and sweet tooth, I&#039;d like to look around for a while. If you&#039;re ever between a rock and a hard place though, elk will get you outta there XD<br /><br />There is a MANGO strain, bush grown, that I&#039;m looking forward to trying out though. :D
