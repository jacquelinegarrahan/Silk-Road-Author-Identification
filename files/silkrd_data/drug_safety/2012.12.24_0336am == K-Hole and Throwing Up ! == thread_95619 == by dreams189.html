				I&#039;ve tried to find information about this by searching SR/Erowid, but couldn&#039;t find anything. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been pretty close to K-Holing, but always get very inside my head about nausea/throwing up that I never reach that place. I guess I have this fear that I am going to k-hole, be lying down (not able to move), and then throw up and choke. The reason I keep thinking about this is because I&#039;ve read once you are in a k-hole, you really can&#039;t move. Does anyone have any experience with this? Am I making this into a bigger issue then it is? <br /><br />Any personal experiences with k-holing are very much appreciated! <br />

				I have no experience with this but my knee-jerk idea is -&nbsp; &nbsp;get a sitter.&nbsp; If it&#039;s someone you trust you won&#039;t need to worry about being incapacitated and choking on your vomit.

				First question. Do you vomit a lot or something? What&#039;s with the near certainty that&#039;ll you&#039;ll be vomiting the moment you fully let go of your senses? Do you suffer from severe vertigo or some other condition which can cause extreme nausea? I&#039;m just curious.<br /><br />Unless you have a strongly affirmative answer to any of those questions, I think you&#039;re needlessly worrying. I&#039;m still pretty new to ket, so take this with a grain of salt. But I would recommend starting out with s isomer. Consensus seems to be that it provides a gentler k-hole experience. So far I&#039;ve only been able to compare one batch of s isomer vs another of racemic, so piddling sample size, but I came to the same conclusion. But even with this racemic, to me the &quot;k-hole&quot; experience is almost totally free of any anxiety or fear. It&#039;s not that I&#039;m immobile, or unaware of my surroundings. If the oven caught on fire while I was k-holing, I&#039;m sure I could stumble over and put it out. It&#039;s just that k-holing is that amazing lucid dream-like experience, so as long as you&#039;re peaking you don&#039;t really want to move or engage with your environment.

You could also try MXE instead, it&#039;s said to be quite similar (haven&#039;t tried K so I can&#039;t speak from experience) but with less or even no nausea.

				Might be an anxiety thing over loss of control, which the k-hole can certainly do! Lay on your side in the fetal position, and tell yourself that if you do vomit, you are much less likely to choke on it that way. The safer you make your trip feel, the easier it&#039;ll be to let go.

				i have puked from doing too much k before and not quite being in a full on hole but close to it, still being able to stand, just walking like a dinosaur. i always figured it was because i did to much so my body expelled the substance as to not allow my body to become sick. i have always been under the impression that if you do too much of a drug, your body will make yourself puke so you don&#039;t overdose? that being said, if you are really worried about it, having a sitter would be a great idea. i highly recommend not doing it at a club for your first time, but rather when you are back home. i also recommend doing some MDMA early on in the night, doing some ketamine while rolling is quite a nice experience :) and if you want to take it one step further, try doing ballon of nitrous or two after you have done the k, its one of my combos of drugs that are pretty fun, putting you on a different level on consciousness that feels amazing :)

				Taking drugs, throwing up, having the vomit block oxygen and then dying from asphyxiation isn&#039;t unusual.&nbsp; Sounds like a pretty valid concern.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used ketamine (and it wasn&#039;t that much) where my mind separated from my body but I could still bring myself back and I could definitely still move.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty satisfied with that even if it isn&#039;t a k-hole although the definition of a k-hole seems murky to me.

				This was really great advice everyone (wish I could +1 you all)!&nbsp; <br /><br />To answer some of the questions: <br />1. No, I&#039;ve actually never thrown up while on drugs (MDMA, shrooms, etc). I guess I am worrying about it because I have never taken a drug where I couldn&#039;t really move that well. On LSD, while in another world, I was jumping around. Same thing goes for some of the other drugs I&#039;ve taken. However, the last time I tried Ket (probably around 150mg snorted), it seemed very difficult to move and at points I did get very nauseous. I think this might have happened because I ate like an hour before, I snorted a lot all at once, and there was a pretty substantial drip that I swallowed (I heard a lot of ket in the stomach makes you very nauseous). <br /><br />2. The sitter idea is pretty fantastic and I did not think of that. Only problem is while I have a lot of friends who I do other drugs with, I haven&#039;t really told people about my ketamine use. Not sure why.....<br /><br />3. Nuyt and Mnak, thank for going into detail about when you are k-holing, being able to maybe get up for a bit of time. That gives me a little more perspective into it. <br /><br />Is it weird if I lie on my stomach the next time if I don&#039;t have a sitter?? Any other experiences? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				the answer is easy if you are afraid of death then try to evade it.<br /><br />if you are afraid of puke dont do k hole. or fight the feeling and go with the flow.<br /><br />
