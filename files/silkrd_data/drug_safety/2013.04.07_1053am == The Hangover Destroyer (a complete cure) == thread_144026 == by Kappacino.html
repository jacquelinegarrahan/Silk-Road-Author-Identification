				Everyone loves getting fucked up, but we all know it comes at a price. Well, after doing a lot of research, going out all the time, and constantly worrying about &quot;what happens if I DO get liver cancer?&quot;, I&#039;ve managed to find both the ultimate hangover remedy and the ultimate alcohol toxicity prevention remedy. I have woken up with that full body ache, barely able to move without feeling like a vietnamese deck hand on an 18th century trade ship, only to take this and either have the hangover fully removed, or in cases of total blackout, brought down from an all encompassing nausea and pain to a mild dull ache. Many people say &quot;it is impossible to completely remove a hangover&quot;. Well, I&#039;m here to say that that&#039;s bullshit. <br /><br />All of these can be bought from Amazon, are relatively inexpensive, last a long time, and actually work. There are other things you can do that will help, such as drinking a glass of water every 2/3 drinks, which I try to do, but let&#039;s be honest, if you&#039;ve got one of those full on deep hangovers, chances are you forgot who you were at some point and so too forgot your rules of drinking procedure.&nbsp; If you go out a lot and often find yourself getting absolutely fucked up, I&#039;d highly recommend taking all of these in the amounts I&#039;ve detailed. What may seem like complicated chemical names are actually OTC products at many health stores, and easily available in every major country online.<br /><br />1. 600mg N-acetylcsteine - This is a something of a miracle when it comes to treating alcohol toxicity, both short term and long term. Various studies have shown that this greatly guards against liver damage and is a real all time champion at preventing alcohol induced disease.&nbsp; For this reason this is one of two (milk thistle is the other) that I advocate taking before you go out, and again in the morning when you wake up, 600mg each time. 100 capsules for around $10 on amazon.<br /><br />Link to clearnet study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19251114<br /><br />2. 200mg Thiamin aka Vitamin b-1 - Again another incredible vitamin, especially for detoxification, and preventing against alcohol induced brain damage. Best taken the morning after.<br /><br />Link to clearnet study: http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/134-142.htm<br /><br />3. 2000 mcg Vitamin b-12 - This is great for removing the actual feeling of hangover. This taken with vitamin b-6 is sort of the poor man&#039;s hangover cure, but works much better when taken with the full spectrum. Best taken the morning after.<br /><br />Clearnet link: http://www.livestrong.com/article/383214-vitamin-b12-alcoholism/<br /><br />4. 400mg Vitamin b-6 - Works wonders at reducing the feeling of hangover especially when taken with b-12 and vitamin C.&nbsp; Also works wonders in the long term prevention of alcohol induced cancer. Best taken the morning after. <br /><br />Link to clearnet study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15940618<br /><br />5. 500 mg Milk thistle - Has been shown to reduce feeling of hangover as well as prevent certain conditions such as alcohol induced hepatic fibrosis. I recommend taking 500mg before you go out, and another 500mg when you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />Link to clearnet study: http://journals.lww.com/jcge/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2003&amp;issue=10000&amp;article=00013&amp;type=abstract<br /><br />6. 1000mg Vitamin C - Is a good thing to take anyway, but is known to help in reducing oxidant stress brought about by excessive consumption of alcohol. Best taken the morning after.<br /><br />Link to clearnet study: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/f-w99/newresearch.html<br /><br />7. 1800mg Cordyceps Sinensis - I initially started taking this before working out. It was discovered by people living high up in mountainous areas, and is known to greatly help the body with intake of oxygen. There hasn&#039;t been much research regarding this and hangover prevention but it DOES work, I feel like I can breathe easier, and it has actually shown great benefit in helping counteract alcohol induced liver problems by up to 70%.&nbsp; Best taken the morning after.<br /><br />Clearnet link: http://www.mushroomnutrition.com/cordyceps-sinensis<br /><br />8. Berocca (or some other similar product). This is an absolutely incredible across the board multivitamin, tastes good too. Personally this is what I drink everything down with, and can work wonders even on its own. Taken with everything else in the morning, this is an absolute God level product. Has brought me back from the brink of death too many times. <br /><br />9. Water + greasy food + coffee/red bull. Need I say more? This is a time tested method, no need to elaborate.<br /><br />10. Sex. Would recommend as a cure for basically anything, including brain cancer, so it may as well go on the list here.<br /><br />So to recap, and to perhaps make it easier to understand, after months of trial and error, this is how I recommend taking them.<br /><br />Before going out: 600mg N-acetylcysteine, 500mg Milk thistle<br /><br />Upon waking: 600mg N-acetylcysteine, 500mg Milk thistle, 200mg Thiamin (b1), 2000mcg vitamin b-12, 400mg vitamin b-6, 1000mg vitamin c, 1800mg Cordyceps sinensis, and 1 berocca. I also chug a couple glasses of water as soon as I get up. Throw in some coffee and some bacon and you&#039;re set. Get a blowjob and a massage too and you&#039;re on fucking cloud 9. Watch out with that one though, if you go for the full home run, shit I&#039;ve seen greater men than me weep at the beauty.<br /><br />If you take just a couple of these compounds, it can help, but to really destroy the hangover you will need to take all of them. Water + food are essential too.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Honestly, this shit works absolute wonders. It&#039;s taken me some time to perfect and I&#039;ve tried many bunk products but this shit right here is 100% legit. I am constantly stocked up on all of these and a $100 purchase will last for months, depending on how often you go out. I think on average it costs around $3 per hangover, when everything is taken into account. I cannot even begin to emphasise how many times I&#039;ve woken up with that dense nausea only for it to be fully, or mostly gone 45 minutes later. I researched this because I often end up getting absolute hammered and the hangovers were really getting to me. It would get to the point where after heavy nights, I would have to spend a full day out of commission, barely able to move without vomiting. This combination OBLITERATES that feeling. The only bastard that I am yet to completely tame is the hangover brought about by red wine. This will bring it down by about 80% but that fucker has ways of remaining that are beyond my comprehension, and that of medical science.<br /><br />Anyway that is it, I&#039;ll update the list if I find anything new worth mentioning. <br />

				Interesting post.<br />I always found a heavy dose of a benzo cures a hangover pretty well but probably unpractical.<br /><br />I may just try your methods and see how it goes :)

				As soon as I saw you list N-acetylcysteine, I knew this wasn&#039;t just another one of those random home remedies. It really is amazing stuff!<br /><br />NAC is also great after a cocaine binge ;)<br /><br />Another helpful amino I&#039;ve found to work well is L-Asparagine, it speeds up the body&#039;s functions for breaking down alcohol so it sobers you up faster.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit harder to find, but I think you can buy it in Europe under the name Paraxine<br /><br />

				Most of that is not cure. Some of the method just hide the symptoms. <br /><br />The proper CURE is detoxication. The best detox method at home is enema. If you make it you&#039;ll remove most of the poison from the system. And your blood will start being filtered again. <br /><br />Greasy food or milk is more poison!! Do not eat it. You &#039;ll destroy your liver or pancreas.

In terms of long term alcohol induced disease prevention, many of these can help greatly, as the studies show. In terms of curing the feeling of hangover, well these will get that done too.<br /><br />But ultimately I agree with you, an enema will do wonders. They&#039;re good even if you&#039;re not drunk/hungover.&nbsp; Personally I find its a lot easier to down a dozen pills, eat breakfast and have a wank, than it is to stick a tube up your ass and play the waiting game, but I can&#039;t fault you on the science side of things :)
