				So, scientific studies state LSD is not neurotoxic, does not damage DNA, and that no one is known to have overdosed from it. <br /><br />Yet, I often hear of people who did LSD frequently or took large doses and are now clearly more neurologically impaired than before (e.g., on a Drugs Inc. episode on psychedelics, a former cop was exposed to large quantities of LSD and now had difficulty navigating and turning in space).<br /><br />Are these cases coincidences, due to impurities in the LSD, do these people already have predispositions to mental illness/neurological disorders, etc.? <br /><br />I was wondering how to explain the discrepancy.

				Well, you can OD on LSD, but you would need to eat a whole blotter and you cant afford that.<br /><br />If you are sick before, LSD can trigger that earlier. But if your mind is healthy, there&#039;s no way.<br />The only thing than can happen is HPPD (google it). Tho its very rare.<br /><br />Just make sure you know what you&#039;re doing and don&#039;t trip too often. Then you should be fine.<br /><br />Remember: alcohol is more dangerous than acid.

				On as little as one to two hits of LSD, I&#039;ve felt sharp pains before in my body for short periods of time. Is this normal/has anyone else experienced this?

				Once was with breathing, in my chest (when I was drivingâ€” I decided to pull over), and once was on the inside side of my left thigh. The pains weren&#039;t debilitating, but they were definitely there, and sharp. I don&#039;t know what to think about it. They didn&#039;t last more than a minute or two.

				Driving on acid? Dude. Maybe it was God punishing you ...<br /><br />I am quite surprised that you could feel clear pain, as you should have a detached sensitivity. Maybe it is your body interpreting signals wrong. Would not worry about it though if it only lasted for a short time and did not freak you out.

				Driving on acid? I&#039;ve done it, and it&#039;s no fun. <br />Drugs, INC is FAKE drama ass bullshit. Watch the MDMA episode. and see how ALL of the paramedics, and even the &quot;overdoser&quot; are the world&#039;s WORST actors. <br />Drugs, INC is just another scare tactic. Don&#039;t believe me? Look up Moonshiners, and see how much they got sued for. <br />Drugs, INC is next. There is not one single reality show based on reality.

				Apparently LSD affects me differently than most other people. I&#039;ve tripped 10-20 times on it, and never hallucinated yet. I just sort of feel more like myself, and can turn anything I do into an art. Driving on LSD means I can feel much more of the car, I have quicker reactions, and I swear I might even have sharper vision. I have never once felt I had lower ability or distraction from anything, on LSD. At piano, thought, sex, and speaking I am a god.

				I would just like to input that i have dosed a lot in my years. I remember times when sharing a whole vial with just me and my girlfriend. The most i have consumed would probably be 1.5ML at once of some very clean and pure white crystal. And I must say i have been off it for like 4-6 months now, i have not had any significantly noticeable harsh experiences / neurological disorders&nbsp; due to the high intake of lsd. Maybe being more quiet;less talkative at random times . (Occasionally when im really&nbsp; Stoned)&nbsp; Also maybe some very mild HPPD like symptoms-which i should add not unpleasant or anything really intense, very mild effects; 80% of the time were enjoyable times involving high (synchronicity) would spark up these states for me. <br /><br />I Would also love to hear others Feedback on this subject as it is a very interesting topic not many discuss.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Peace be the Journey, SR!

				Physical effects from acid (assuming its not dosed with an RC or DOx) are probably due to ergot poisoning. Since LSD is made from an ergot fungus, it is thought physical effects are from an ergot like compounds which have not been purified out (lower quality LSD) and would cause back tension. I had this happen a lot when a lot of unclean LSD was going around in the early 90&#039;s. We would always talk about how &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; it was, the dirty being physical effects like back/neck tension.

				I don&#039;t actually believe alcohol is safer than LSD. For one thing, alcohol doesn&#039;t make a person potentially relive their most dark and depressing hours on Earth. Alcohol also doesn&#039;t make a person completely break down the walls of their mind; The mind is a very sensitive thing and LSD turns it completely upside down, if only for ~12 hours. So I&#039;d say the risks for LSD are psychological and they&#039;re far greater than alcohol. You can find the internet riddled with strange stories pertaining to LSD: People whose sense of time slows down when they yawn . . . others who are still tripping and freaking out a whole week after taking the drug, more still seeing the perceptual changes months or even years after taking a small dose.<br /><br />So be careful people. Not a casual drug for the faint hearted, and certainly some risk involved.

				Don&#039;t take my response as fact, but I do know a stoner that has used acid HEAVILY from age of 14-24, in his own words every time he &quot;had a problem in life&quot; he&#039;d drop a tab of acid ..<br /><br />he has stopped now but he tells me even now on the rare occasion he gets flashbacks to previous trips and sometimes if he stares long enough in one corner he&#039;ll see lots of shapes/colours if he stares long enough into one space or at a wall..not sure if he&#039;s bullshitting but he sounded pretty straight up when he told me

				I actually read up on this recently. I read about syd barrett but still- if i can find the article ill post it.<br />From what I understand, most of the psych community believes that any mental or neurological impairment that followed an acid trip, was simply a pre-existing, and oft dormant, condition that was exacerbated by the drug; meaning: IF YOU ARE SCHIZOPHRENIC DO NOT TAKE LSD!!! In extreme cases the user can devolpe HPPD whereupon they have persistent hallucinations or &#039;flashbacks&#039;, but thats rare and is not the same thing as dementia. Plus they have hard time proving that hppd even exists.<br /><br />it should also be noted that LSD is a very affectual drug, and no matter what your trip is like (good or bad) it will undoubtly change your perspective for an indefinite amount of time. This even more so if you experience a really bad trip and freak-out entirely (or so I&#039;ve heard; knock on wood). So coming out a little weird is a possibilty even for sane person!<br /><br />LSD is a wonderful thing, but at the same time its not to be taken lightly; it&#039;s for real
