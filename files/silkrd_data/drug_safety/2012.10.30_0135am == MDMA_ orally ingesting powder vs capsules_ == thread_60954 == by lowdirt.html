				Hi,<br />I have a gram of MDMA powder. Does pouring some into a capsule and swallowing said capsule make the trip longer as opposed to licking my finger and dipping into the baggie? I would imagine it would, given that it takes your body time to metabolize it, etc.<br /><br />Also, I have a scale that measures grams but not much more. How would I best go about filling the empty capsules with 150-200mg of powder?<br /><br />Thanks!

				You&#039;ll need a scale that can measure at least in 10ths of a gram.<br /><br />Capping it will make it take longer to come up since the capsule has to dissolve first, but it eliminates the gross taste, and it&#039;s easy to carry around, but the roll duration wont be any different.

				$20 will get you an ok mg scale accurate to within plus/minus 5 mg or so - that&#039;s the only quick &amp; easy way to measure doses like that.&nbsp; Capped dose just means slightly slower come-up, and maybe a slightly lower peak, probably not enough of a difference for you to notice much if at all.

				When my friends and I took MDMA, we put the crystalpieces into a cig rolling paper and just swallowed it. The trip started around 30-45 minutes after the swallowing with an approaching feeling that we have to move. <br />I took MDMA 3 times so far, one time to party, two times to think about stuff and talk with friends. IMO its a waste to party on MDMA, its just a superficial experience, the real power of it is giving you new perspectives,
