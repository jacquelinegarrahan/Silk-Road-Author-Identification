				60mg is not enough to roll, especially if you take an SSRI. I always take about 250 mg to have the perfect roll, so up your dosage. You shouldn&#039;t need to wait, just do it when you can.

				Which ssri are you taking? There are some that will completely prevent you from rolling while you&#039;re on it, especially if you&#039;re taking a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. Your ideal starting dose for MD is 120mg.

				It&#039;s not surprising that MDMA didn&#039;t do anything for you. <br /><br />My advice would be to hang onto the rest of your stash until your doctor says it&#039;s safe to go off of the Celexa. Then give it a good 2 weeks before trying MDMA again.

				Gotta learn what goes with what OP. SSRI&#039;s cancel MDMA and doing 60mg wont do anything at all. You need at least 100-180mg. Like the poster above said, quit the SSRIs for a bit, wait two weeks and hit it with the right dose.

				I posted an example of this effect a few weeks ago. I went out to a club with a friend (female, 5&#039;2&quot;, petite), I took a standard dose (total of around 180mg) and had a particularly intense experience. My friend ate 250mg and had absolutely no response at all. She&#039;d been taking fluoxetine for a few weeks prior to this. I kind of feel intrusive asking people if they&#039;re on antidepressants before giving them drugs though&nbsp; :-\

				&nbsp;:) Howdy OP,<br />I also take Celexa: 20mg a day. Celexa as you know is SSRI.&nbsp; Check out this page to learn exactly how Ecstasy and SSRIs work in the brains nerves. It shows how serotonin is released and uptaken and should answer all of your queries.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dancesafe.org/drug-information/ecstasy-slideshow<br /><br />It will take at least 72 hours for Celexa to leave your bloodstream. You will also want to eat some foods high in amino acids, especially Tryptophan. This includes chicken, turkey, and fresh/frozen soy beans.&nbsp; It often takes two weeks for serotonin levels to recover to &quot;normal&quot; after being depleted by Ecstasy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The benefit to having a handy SSRI is that if you roll too heavily and want to come down, take an SSRI to do just that and avoid any neurotoxic effects.<br /><br />So as another Celexa user of around your weight, I would plan ahead after your latest attempt, allowing two full weeks for the serotonin to replenish- even though you did a very minor dose.&nbsp; My diet in those two weeks would be amino acid heavy, centering on good chicken and turkey and fresh frozen edamame Soy Beans (they&#039;re kind of stringy, but crisp and delicious and cook them like regular green beans or stir fry).&nbsp; You might get a multi-amino acid supplement as well to maximize brain chemical replacement and recovery after your roll.&nbsp; <br /><br />5 days before your planned roll I would stop taking Celexa, and if you plan this ahead of time, you might taper down to a half dose the 3 days before that.<br /><br />On your planned day of rolling, eat a big breakfast, but then nothing else for about 6-7 hours and drink lots of water so you will be hydrated well before the roll.&nbsp; You probably would also want to take a major BM during the day to avoid any surprises during rolling. Take another multi-amino supplement, Vitamin C, Vitamin e, and a multivitamin. I also prefer to max out my B vitamins with a multi B vitamin.&nbsp; Then &quot;parachute&quot; a 125 mg dose (this 125mg Ecstasy wrapped in a tiny rolling paper), wait exactly 45 minutes and parachute another 40-60mgs dose.&nbsp; Do not wait over an hour to do this- the tolerance will have already escalated at that point. make it under an hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get ready to party.<br /><br />Finally, if you are going out driving, get to where you need to be BEFORE parachuting anything.<br /><br />Probably stay away from alcohol.<br /><br />Once you come down around 5-6 hours later, take your normal Celexa dose before bed.&nbsp; Take the next daily dose at lunch the next day. Return to normal scheduling.&nbsp; Again wait a couple of weeks before rolling again.<br /><br />Finally, you might like some nice weed and wine for final come down before bed.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />DrunkenAfficianado

I fear the high euphoria a bit because I won&#039;t get that feeling without drugs. I don&#039;t need or want the overall perfect feeling, but just a little mood rise, you know? I searched for the mdma threshold and it is about 30mg, so I did 60mg.<br /><br />Thank you all for answering.

				Dude...you can&#039;t get physically addicted to MDMA, it&#039;s impossible. And you aren&#039;t going to feel SHIT from 60mg. You need to do 100-150mg depending on your size/weight/metabolic rate. I&#039;m quite a big guy so I take 180-250mg at a time. <br /><br />You need to check this shit out. Where did you hear that 30mg was the threshold dose? Christ you could have just wikid it and got the proper dose there lol.

				Hello,<br />i just stopped using the SSRI.<br />I have the following pill:<br />Edit because not relevant and would be a bad review maybe.<br /><br />Should I try a half or the whole one?<br />Or is it a good idea to try a half and about an hour later the next half, just to be safe?<br /><br />Is this the same pill? :-O<br />Edited<br /><br />Tried a half 20 minutes ago.

				You should probably wait 2-4 weeks for the SSRI to be completely flushed out of your body, and for your body to readjust and go about its business as it did pre-SSRI.

				Had a wild one on Friday night- one of the girls I was out with had been tapering her citalopram dose and had finished the previous Sunday. She&#039;d never taken any MDXX drugs before &amp; let&#039;s just say she responded VERY well to her dose.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Love seeing the afterglow on girls after their first drop&nbsp; :P<br /><br />So in this case cessation of citalopram a week before dosing allowed her to respond fully to the MD.

				Very important key factors.<br /><br />You cannot roll on an ssri. If you feel anything it will only be neutral or negative side effects.<br /><br />As others have stated, 100mg is the minimum to lets say &quot;breaking through&quot; for most people who aren&#039;t even on ssri&#039;s.<br /><br />Even somebody taking a high dose (170mg+), might not be able to consistently roll to their satisfaction if they do it even as infrequently as every few weeks.<br /><br />It&#039;s the kind of thing you want to save for a few special occasions/big events.&nbsp; IMO using 3 to 4 times a year would be optimal, with perhaps a year-long break every few years (if you can manage!!!)<br /><br />MDMA doesn&#039;t make you feel good, MDMA releases serotonin which makes you feel good.<br />The production on serotonin in the human body is a sensitive mechanism and requires time, patience and respect.<br /><br />My personal advice to you is to taper your meds down until you&#039;re off them (if you wish to do that...it&#039;s the only way you&#039;ll roll), wait a couple of months and take 150mg, on a reasonably empty stomach. <br />I understand your concerns about not wanting the drug to feel so good that you feel like you&#039;ll become addicted from loving it too much. Remember what I said about serotonin?&nbsp; It&#039;s actually not possible to maintain a very frequent MDMA habit and have it remain magical and worthwhile, as the human body does not have enough serotonin.&nbsp; It will certainly leave a very good lasting impression, and you will think about it often.&nbsp; It&#039;s all fond memories and happiness knowing that after a couple of months passes, you can do it again!<br />Everyone is different, but if you follow my advice then I think you have a great chance at having a fantastic time with MDMA!&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S - Do it with friends if you can, it&#039;s so much better!<br />Set and setting are important, not cause you might freak out or anything, just cause mdma is made for sharing feelings and being on that level together.<br /><br />Goodluck!

				I am having a very difficult time rolling on Molly.&nbsp; <br />I wonder if it&#039;s b/c of a cross tolerance with the anti-depressants/anti-psychotics/viagra/heroin/coke/crack /LSD/DMT/magic mushrooms/weed/hash/tobacco/alcohol/benzos/GHB/Meth/internet porn/ I&#039;ve been doing for the last 20 years.<br /><br />This is gonna be very fucking difficult but I&#039;ll try abstaining for 3 hours and then try another 500 mg. rail of that X.
