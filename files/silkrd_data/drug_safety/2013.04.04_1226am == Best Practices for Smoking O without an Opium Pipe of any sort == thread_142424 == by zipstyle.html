				I did my research, ladies and gentlemen, and concluded that I needed to put together a concise and easy-to-follow guide for the layperson in the practices of consuming this wonderful gift of the earth. The following is a compilation of my findings and personal experimentation:<br /><br />How To Hot-Knife Opium:<br />Step 1: Break off a piece and roll a small ball of opium that you plan on smoking.<br />Step 2: cut a plastic bottle in half<br />Step 3: place the ball of opium in a spoon or other similar metal surface.<br />Step 4: heat a knife on a stove or with a lighter until it starts changing color. If it&#039;s in dim lighting the knife should be glowing slightly.<br />Step 5: apply the hot knife to the ball of opium in the spoon<br />Step 5: hold the half-bottle over the spoon with your mouth on the opening to catch the vapor.<br />Step 6: Inhale the vapor and enjoy! :)<br /><br />I also devised a lazyman&#039;s method, which I&#039;m sure some people would appreciate that just wanna do this easily without having to use scissors. The only thing you will need differently in this one is a jar or bottle.<br /><br />Step 1: Put the little ball of opium on the end of a knife.<br />Step 2: Hold a lighter under that end of the knife until opium starts to melt and release vapor.<br />Step 3: When you think it&#039;s at a peak hot temp, hold the bottle/jar/whatever upside-down over the knife and allow it to collect all the vapor as the knife cools down.<br />Step 4: Take knife out and suck down all that vapor!<br />Step 5: Repeat until nodding wonderfully.<br /><br />I hope this guide is helpful!&nbsp; ;D<br />It was originally included in TheScurvyCrew&#039;s review thread but I figured it would be more accessible in Drug Safety. <br /><br />-zipstyle

				Personally i will probably make myself a DIY vaporiser from a lightbulb next time i&#039;m doing opium.<br />There&#039;s plenty of guides on clearweb for making one and its not hard at all, first time i made one it took me 20min orso and it worked for weed and hash.<br />It should be perfect for O imo

				This isn&#039;t quite tool-less, but all you need is a knife, plastic bottle, aluminum foil, tape, and fire. Using the knife, cut off the top of the plastic bottle (keep the top, discard the bottom). Tape the aluminum foil to the bottom of the top (i.e. end opposite the cap). I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s necessary, but I always poke some holes in the bottom of the aluminum foil on the edges (not where you&#039;ll be heating, don&#039;t want to inhale combustion gases). Unscrew the lid, load in drug xyz, screw the lid on lightly, heat with fire, unscrew the lid and take your hit when you&#039;ve vaporized enough. Really easy to control temperature (you can move your fire closer or further away) and you can visually see when you&#039;ve vaporized enough of drug xyz. I would advise using a relatively large bottle (I used quart sized bottles) so that you can keep the fire in the center of the aluminum and far away from the combustible plastic.
