				Up here in the Great White North, Black tar Heroin is extremely rare. 20 years ago very strong China White was abundant...nowadays it&#039;s mostly stepped on Afghan. Anyways.. when I first started chipping I just skin popped and that always provided a satisfying nod and taste in my mouth. Of course, I eventually started I.Ving a few months later and ended up becoming a full blown Junky for 3 years... during which, when I was dope sick would fix Morphine pills or Diilie&#039;s which I never really properly filtered. Consequently, my &quot;fixing sites&quot; are messed up from the wax and hardened filter and so when I do fix (which is maybe once or twice a month) I prefer to I.M. to avoid complications. I find I get the same euphoria as an I.V.: it&#039;s just delayed by a few minutes. The few times I have I.Ve&#039;d BTH I got a nasty allergic reactions (painful injection,swelling at site).<br /><br />My question is this: I wish there was cheaper powder of good quality but currently, most of the SR H scene seems to be flooded with BTH. I know the best &quot;bang for the buck&quot;&nbsp; is to I.V. it...but is it at all possible to fix BTH I.M (assuming of course that all the harm reduction methods are taken)? I know there are differing opinions on this matter: some say your risking cysts or just wasting it etc... but opinion seems to vary on this matter. Hatter26 recommends using a micro-filter: but I have gone to several pharmacies asking for one and they look at me like I am from Mars (although buying rigs in Canada without prescription or proof of diabetes is legal). &quot; Thank goodness there are no laws here against &quot;drug paraphenellia&quot;.<br /><br />I could really use a good nod. Thanks for any advice/observations. :) <br /><br />P.S.: I am not terribly interested in trying to snort or plug Tar.<br />

Tar is not like powder.<br />All tars have by products that must be minimized for your safety.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used a 100 unit (1 milliliter) diabetic syringe having the smallest gauge available of 30. I drew up one full milliliter of purified bottle water and squirted it into a standard Tablespoon. I then rolled up the tar into a small ball and dropped it mid center of the spoon and water. I then heated up the spoon with a lighter to warm the water. Once I saw steam rising, I stopped. You do not want to let water boil. I then took the cap cover of the syringe and began to push and separate the tar into the water. Once the tar had broken down and was fully dissolved, I dropped in a blue Litmus Paper. The color remained bright blue indicating a high alkaline content.&nbsp; I then took the lighter and re-heated a second time.<br />The water was a very dark, thick color.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;I placed a small piece of cotton into the spoon and sucked up the solution until the spoon was empty and the cotton fully heaved. I then took my moistened .22-micron wheel filter and ran the tar solution through it and back onto the spoon. At this point the tar solution was much more clear, almost slight rust color. I then took an eyedropper and put in about 3 drops of a natural apple cider vinegar into the spoon. I took a fresh piece of Litmus Paper and the paper now turned into a lighter blue indicating the Ph level had been raised from alkaline to a more neutral Ph. I placed a new piece of cotton into the spoon and sucked up all the solution with the syringe until the cotton was fully heaved a second time. The watercolor was now slightly brown tinted and appropriately Ph balanced to minimize sting to my veins.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;I then took some antibacterial soap gel and washed the area at the bend of my elbow where a nice juicy vein was. I burped the syringe, wiped my vein with cotton. The needle was inserted into my vein, then I drew back to check for blood flow to ensure I had hit the vein. When using tar, it is very important that you hit a vein and not pop your skin, as this is where Black Tar can create the most damage to tissue. I shot in approximately 50 units (1/2 a milliliter) and then withdrew the needle. I waited about 5 to 10 minutes and began to feel the dope kick in and blew the rest of the syringe into my vein. The tar still stung some indicating that the next time I need a few more drops of vinegar. I got a real nice heavy, yet mellow buzz.<br /><br />For those of you that are Not into IV’ing, you can simply follow steps 1 and 2 and instead of a syringe use an eyedropper and place about 5 drops into each nostril. If there’s any sting adjust with apple cider vinegar.<br /><br />For Powder Heroin, simply follow the same Steps EXCEPT:<br /><br />Step 1. You do not have to Heat a 2nd time.<br />Step 2. You typically only need to pass through cotton one time.<br />You do not need to add Vinegar or anything to change Ph<br /><br />oppyate

				Wheel Filters you can find right here on SR or beleive it or not Amazon. Be sure its at min a .22 micron, nylon or natural fibers and litmus paper you can get a medical supply store or...here it comes.Amazon! The way to find out if your Tar if Alkaline is to take a few drops of your mix and drop a few in your nose. If it stings like a mother fucker, its very alkaline. As you add Apple Cider Vinegar (NOT Regular Vinegar) you&#039;ll notice the sting goes away. When your nose no longer stings, the you know your ready to puncture a vein, that&#039;s if you cant find BLUE Litmus Paper.<br /><br />oppy
