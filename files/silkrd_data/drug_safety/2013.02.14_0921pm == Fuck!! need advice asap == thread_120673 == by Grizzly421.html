				I fucked up and forgot that I have to go to outpatient rehab class tonight and tested out my first stash of mdpv that i have had in over a year. I only did a 5mg bump but it is pretty strong shit. I am not incapacitated, I just returned from taking an exam in a college class, and did well on the test and did so without arising any strange looks from teacher or peers. However, that was not a setting where they know I have a history with drugs. Any advice besides not go as I have to or else risk jail time. I don&#039;t think I will be obvious in another 2 hours but the anxiety will be almost unbearable. <br /><br />Not going or other drugs to reduce the anxiety are not an option, unless they are OTC and UA safe.

				I would say if you absolutely can&#039;t take a half milli of xanax or klonopin, any benzo, and you have two full hours, do some deep breathing and meditation, focusing on each breath.&nbsp; You&#039;ve just got to calm down.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t do that with drugs, then the only things left are, like, sleep and time.&nbsp; And, you don&#039;t have a lot of either.&nbsp; So, just take what time you have and chill out, drink something warm and just try to concentrate on the fact that if you made it through that class you can make it through this rehab thing no problem.&nbsp; You got this.

				If you have access to propranalol (prescribed to someone who has a racing heart or other cardiac problems), take 40mg. It will stop the secretion of adrenaline, so physcially you won&#039;t show any signs of intoxication. Yeah that&#039;s a longshot that you would have that available, but maybe source some for the future ; )<br /><br />Sleepy gave great advice: pay attention to your breath- Deep, slow breathing for anxiety will help. Remember that you can think before you speak, don&#039;t be in a hurry to respond to questions. That helps me when I&#039;m feeling overly stimulated in social situations. Learn meditation for reducing the physical and mental symptoms of stress; It&#039;ll save your heart and your mind from premature breakdown over the years : D<br /><br />Good luck

				Update just because I appreciate the responses.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t go. Well I got dropped off at the place 30 minutes early, and proceeded to walk right past the door and down the road. After a pretty nice 20 minutes walk (that normally takes closer to 30) I was home. I started to feel a migraine coming on and that really would only compound my problems, and it makes for a believable (because its true) reason for skipping. <br /><br />By the way anyone have any migraine remedies, besides sleep, because that isn&#039;t happening anytime soon. <br />I took 3 200mg ibuprofen but in my experience the only thing that really ever helps is sleep. <br />

				Well, I hope they don&#039;t revoke your probation or some other dumb shit for missing.&nbsp; I can totally relate to migraines.&nbsp; I get them all the time, ever since an Italian-made anti-tank mine setting atop 250lbs of homemade explosives blew up under the armored truck I was riding in.&nbsp; Rung my bell pretty good.&nbsp; I&#039;m on imitrex injections (6mg) for the attacks, and they suck, but they work.&nbsp; There&#039;s a pill, too, called Treximet.&nbsp; It&#039;s 85mg of sumatriptan (same stuff that&#039;s in Imitrex) and 500mg of Naprosyn.&nbsp; That works, but not as quickly as the injection.&nbsp; Most of the time, those two treatments cover me.&nbsp; But, if neither of those work, a 30mg IR oxycodone does the trick every time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if your migraines aren&#039;t that super bad, like seeing crazy colors in a dark room, puking your guts out bad, then there are some over the counter pills that have ibuprofin, aspirin, and caffeine.&nbsp; Some people swear by them.&nbsp; But, if yours are really bad, see above for success.&nbsp; You can find the treximet pills on the Road (although some fool wanted $25 a pill for them), but it&#039;s easier just to get your doctor to hook you up.

				I don&#039;t think mine are from head trauma, at least not that I know of; I could have been dropped as a baby. From what i have read different causes are not all treated the same way. I think I get vascular migraines but that is me playing internet trained doctor. No otc pain meds have ever worked for me. My best option is a ton of diphenhyramine as long as I can keep from vomiting up and sleeping it off. Generally after even as little as 20 minutes of sleep I feel a whole lot better.&nbsp; But that is not always practical during the middle of the day. Most people don&#039;t understand when I say I have a migraine. They just offer me some advil and expect me to keep going about my buisness. These are not little headaches, they are fucking debilitating, head in a vice, power drill going through you eye, fucking headagony all while your world is spinning and your not sure if you need to shit or puke of both. <br /><br />Sorry for the rant but on a happier note I looked up<br /><br />&quot;Sumatriptan is a synthetic drug belonging to the triptan class, used for the treatment of migraine headaches.<br />Structurally, it is an analog of the naturally occurring neuro-active alkaloids dimethyltryptamine (DMT), bufotenine, and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, <br />with an N-methyl sulfonamidomethyl- group at position C-5 on the indole ring.[1]&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />via wikipedia<br /><br />Pretty interesting though Im guessing you probably already knew that. Maybe I should just trying to smoke some deemster next time i feel one coming on. That would scare the shit out of me if it didn&#039;t work, tripping that hard in that kind of pain.

				Well, I hate to sound like a know-it-all on this subject (migraines), but if you&#039;re a migraine sufferer, and anyone else can chime in here, the odds are VERY good that you&#039;ve not only been to a couple of different doctors, but sometimes TENS of different doctors in an effort to find relief.&nbsp; This is mainly because there are so many school of thought on how to treat migraines, and so few recognized experts in the field overall.&nbsp; In my case, I went through maybe 6 neurologists who didn&#039;t specialize in head trauma (which is funny, because they were all Army doctors, and most of them were working on Soldiers who&#039;d had head injuries), so they were trying everything from their vascular migraine toolbox. Since then, I&#039;ve seen trauma headache specialist across the country.&nbsp; &nbsp;None of these treatments worked for me, so far, but they may be helpful to you.<br /><br />A pretty basic treatment is oxygen.&nbsp; If you can get your hands on an oxygen tank (most medical supply stores and these days many pharmacies sell them), and some tubing, giving yourself oxygen during an attack may very well help.&nbsp; Another proven intervention is steroid therapy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can&#039;t give you any idea of the dosages; I just know that in an ER setting I&#039;ve been given IV cocktails of phenergan, torodal, and prednisone.&nbsp; The steroids act on the blood vessels in the brain, and very quickly ease vascular migraines in many patients.&nbsp; <br /><br />Taking all that Benadryl isn&#039;t good for you (although I think you knew that; sorry).&nbsp; I know exactly how it feels to just want to sleep the fucking thing off, though.&nbsp; Sometimes, my migraines blow right through the triptans, and until I was able to source some opiates (thank you, Silk Road), I was in complete misery.&nbsp; I overdosed on Klonopin once during a migraine, not to kill myself, but just to try to sleep.&nbsp; I went to sleep, all right - and woke up 12 hours later with the same migraine.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are two types of migraine meds: prevention and emergency (attack).&nbsp; Topomax is an anti-seizure medication which has been well-studied to prevent migraines.&nbsp; The studied dosage was 100mg per day.&nbsp; I&#039;m on 300 and it doesn&#039;t help, but it might work for you.&nbsp; Verapimil is a blood pressure medication that has also been shown to be effective in preventing migraines.&nbsp; As far as emergency meds, the first line options are the triptans.&nbsp; Maxalt is a triptan that melts under your tongue, and it&#039;s kind of the weakest of them.&nbsp; And I told you already about treximet and imitrex.&nbsp; They&#039;re the best of the triptans.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get to a doctor, though, and you don&#039;t have migraines every other day (like, maybe 6 a month or less), then go on the Road, buy 10/500 Vicodin/Acetaminophin, and when you have an attack, take 2 and 500mg Naproxen (that&#039;s a prescription level dose of an otc drug, just get close to 500, but don&#039;t exceed 650).&nbsp; Don&#039;t abuse the painkillers, or they&#039;ll stop working.&nbsp; But, the best thing to do is go see a doc and get some Imitrex or Treximet, along with some kind of preventative medication.<br /><br />Hope some of that&#039;s helpful.&nbsp;
