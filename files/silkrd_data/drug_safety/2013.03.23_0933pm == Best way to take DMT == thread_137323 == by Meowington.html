				Hello all. :) I&#039;ve finally decided to get some DMT... And don&#039;t get me wrong on this post, I&#039;ve definitely done my fair share of research... but I was planning on using The Machine yo smoke it, but I was looking for all of your opinions on how I should do it. :) Thanks all.

				Hey bro, I&#039;m an occasional smoker, and far from expert.... The D is mad and deep, as you probably know already. Have you checked out the dmt-nexus forum on the clearnet? Some wise heads there.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of &quot;The Machine&quot; but after blundering about trying to vape crystals (hard) I made a nice waterfall bong from a glass liquor bottle. Used a tile bit to drill a hole just above the base, and put a glass stem through a cork and into the neck. <br /><br />I like this, cause you can control the heating, make all your smoke first, and cool the funky shit, before you&#039;ve hit any of the fucking stuff!! The moment the first molecule reaches it&#039;s destination, all your carefully laid out plans will rapidly unwind in wild and unpredictable ways...<br /><br />Changa (herb mix) is easier to manage than pure crystals, especially for a noob, so mix in some dried mint or parsley or whatever to facilitate vaping/prevent scorching.<br /><br />DON&#039;T DRINK ANY ALCOHOL!!! The elves fucking hate that, and they will make you puke while you&#039;re passed out...bad.<br /><br />Start easy, and work up. Spice can massively overload your system, and it&#039;s easy to have too much. Which is a bit like living through all 3 Matrix movies in only 20 minutes. <br /><br />Be prepared to put some effort in, learn how it uses you, and have some awesome encounters.<br /><br />

				If you are ordering it, and have a small amount, finding a way to vape it is prob the best. I&#039;ve seen and used all types of contraptions, from heating steal wool, to intricate glass bongs and pipes, to vaporizing machines. Me, I&#039;m lucky that I have a friend that extracts it, so I go the traditional path of using a pipe. Put a small bit of herb inside, sprinkle some crystals over top, then cover the crystals with more herb. Light up and recline!<br /><br />I can also recommend nature as the best environment every time. I personally enjoy being by a river or near some bush.<br /><br />Good fortune on your journey :)

				Thanks for the replies! I&#039;ll have to look into building a waterfall bong as you say, and sadly, my pipe broke the other day. So, I&#039;m left with very few choices haha. I do actually have enough spice for about 4 trips... and I do plan on buying more... So I will probably try out The Machine for my first go, and I might have to hit you up on building this bong you mentioned Yoshi! Ill put up some photos... if any of you has experience with the Machine... I&#039;d like to know what you think. :) Thanks for the replies again.<br /><br />Some pictures of my &quot;Machine&quot;.

It does last longer though.<br /><br />The waterfall bong is simple as, same as you may have made for weed, from a soda bottle. Hole at the bottom, gauze at the top, let the draining water pull the smoke inside. Whatever way you go, use the thing only for spice, as you will never be able to clean it of the god-awful smell of spice (&quot;burnt plastic&quot;) so don&#039;t fuck up e.g. a cherished weed bong!

				There are many ways to enjoying spice, but smoking is probably the most frequently used,<br /><br />After trying pipes, glass pipes, etc I did get The Machine and never looked back - it does give you a very good chance for breakthrough every time and does not burn spice, so none of that horrible taste everyone was talking about.<br /><br />This is a good thread dedicated to DMT, vendors and best ways to visit this hyperspace:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.msg931627#msg931627<br /><br />Links to photos do not open in my chrome browser, sorry.<br /><br />Be good!

				This is roughly what I have - this is a minibar bottle.<br />http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/The_Machine<br /><br />In my mind the reasons I would go for a smaller bottle would be:<br />1. your stainless steel mesh should be as small as possible as when you smoke DMT it runs away from your lighter into the stainless steel mesh and the bigger it is the more of it will remain there for forever (hard to heat up the whole piece of mesh you were showing on your photo)<br />2. total volume of the bottle - the smaller it is the more direct vapour will travel into your lungs ... if the bottle is 1L in volume you might need to take that in before DMT will be kicking in<br />3. in tiny bottle it is actually easy to store and travel with<br /><br />... but this is just my opinion as I have never tried the machine in this size.

				hmm.. alright... I think I understand now... any clue where I could get one of these bottles? Like what kind of product I should be looking for when I go to the store so I am not wandering around aimlessly looking like an idiot? :p other than that, is that the only problem you can see with my setup? Also, thanks for the link ^_^<br /><br />(oh, preferably not a liquor bottle either... my religion doesn&#039;t act too kindly to alcoholic beverages :p)

				actually, I think I found something that may work... what do you think? (before I go pour all this out and waste it) If I do use it, I will probably have to break off the very bottom(the place where the stuff pours out) because it is much smaller than the actual neck. Hope to hear soon :)<br /><br />http://oi48.tinypic.com/2m4x5oj.jpg

				I again for some reason struggle with the link.<br />The bottle I have is the size of a small Tabasco sauce bottle - should be available everywhere.<br />When you drill the hole in the bottom make it big enough so that you can push thru some sort of pencil or something similar, so that when you push in some mesh you can push it back thru the back with the pencil - this way it will be sitting there solidly and not moving at all.<br />most bottles of this size are minibar alcoholic beverage bottles - 50g tiny little thingies.<br />It might be a blessing that your religion frowns upon alcohol - bad drug it is!

				Alright! Thanks. :) I&#039;m headed off to the store to get dinner anyways for now... I will search for something with a better opening that I won&#039;t have to break off while I am there as well. And about my steel wool, I am using a ScotchBrite brand of copper coated steel wool. I torched it for about an hour actually until no more copper was visible... I&#039;m just having some troubles knowing how compacted I should get it?

				ok... I&#039;m not sure where you are saying to put the DMT. Should it be on the mesh toward the outward side or the side that is connected to the body of the bottle? I suspect on the inside so the flame doesn&#039;t actually touch it. I don&#039;t think that I will be testing tonight... possibly sometime near the end of this month. I actually am planning on dropping some 25c tonight:)

				so use a torch lighter basically? :o I&#039;m really having doubts about the wonders of convection ;p so... do I place the DMT through the mouth piece so it lands on top of the mesh? or do I place it on the other side of the mesh(where the sauce pours out)

				Alright! Cool. Thanks for all of the helpful information and the pep talk! I am really excited and looking forward to trying it out :3 I do have one quick and last question regarding my Machine though. I went to the store again today (not even looking for anything drug related) and I came across an actual Steel Mesh scrubber. The one I have loaded into the machine right now is copper coated steel wool. I didn&#039;t figure that the steel mesh had any coating on it because it was shiny, so I burned it anyway :p (It actually did turn a darker less shiny color) The mesh is kind of a flattened steel rather than a thin wire like the one I have now. I was just wondering which one you think I should use personally. I really don&#039;t want to take my whole machine apart again, but I will definitely do it if it will improve my experience! Thanks. ~ ♥ (I also added a straw mouth piece to my machine since I will be loading it from the bottom now ^-^ no need to drop anything through the hole)

				Dropping the lighter and/or pipe is a pretty common &quot;hazard&quot; for noobs, so if you&#039;re on your own, make sure they don&#039;t have far to fall and will land on something that won&#039;t break them or catch fire!<br /><br />Lying down on the floor with some kind of tray nearby is probably best...<br /><br />You may find your arm grows to about 15 feet in length while you&#039;re inhaling...&nbsp; ;)

				would it be possible for anybody to supply a YouTube video or something for me that goes through the whole process of the machine? :o like putting it on the mesh.. melting it into it... And then hitting it? would feel much better about it with a visual representation. thanks:)

				I considered starting a new thread but my questions might be applicable here as well. I recently got 1gr from rogerpete and the first thing I noticed is - 1gr isn&#039;t that much! it&#039;s about the width and height of 4 or 5 nickels stacked up. I have a scale that measures .01 gr increments with a flat surface. Are you guys lightly sprinkling this stuff on your scales, trying to aim for that 50mg mark? I feel like 50mg would be the size of about half a pinky nail. As far as the smell - I&#039;m getting whiffs of chlorine or some kind of similar smelling chemical. Not questioning RP but is this common for dmt? or maybe just synthesized dmt?

I&#039;ve smoked enough times to the point where I just eyeball my dose because I know exactly how much I need. As a beginner, I would load up probably around 100mg, just to make sure that I blast off. If you don&#039;t smoke it all, you can always hit it again later. (Using the Machine at least). I prefer to be overwhelmed than to be underwhelmed. I remember that when I started out, my method was flawed so I kept loading 100-150mg into it. By the time I figured out what I was doing, I was able to blast off 3 times in a row just from all the DMT that was left over in the Machine.<br /><br />As far as the smell goes, DMT is hard to describe and smells different to all people. To some it smells like mothballs, others like burnt plastic or decaying flesh. To me, it smells of nostalgia. But have no fear with rogerpete, that dude is all aces.

I just personally used more to ensure that I blasted off. Also, non breakthrough experiences are a good starting point to get used to the effects. For example: My first time smoking, when I started to feel the effects, I stopped inhaling because I was unsure about what was about to ensue. I didn&#039;t have any crazy visuals, but I did have the classic &quot;vacuum sealed, sharp lines&quot; experience which I thought was amazing.<br /><br />If you have a milligram scale with a flat surface, just do as incogmagnito said. Take a piece of a rolling paper (or coffee filter) and tare the weight on the scale. Then measure your amount on top of that. I usually use a razor blade to scrape remaining bits off surfaces neatly.

That&#039;s how I learned to build and use mine. As for perfecting the method, now that&#039;s a different story. I use this type of steel mesh (hxxp://www.chemical-engineering.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/steel-wool6.jpg). I&#039;ve used copper stringy type before and it wasn&#039;t nearly as good. Also, dont use too much. About an inch to 3/4 in from the top of the bottle will do. Sprinkle the spice on top of the mesh ( the mesh should be level with the top of the bottle opening). Using a lighter (preferably a torch lighter) gently heat the neck of the bottle. I keep the flame about 2 inches away while slowly rotating the bottle. The spice on the top will slow melt into the mesh. I usually let it sit for a couple minutes. Then turn the bottle upside down, and put the lighter about an inch or two away from the steel and inhale. The indirect heat will vaporize the spice and billow the chamber with smoke. It&#039;s actually pretty simple. I&#039;ve fitted a 90 degree straw into the bottom hole (where you inhale) by filing the hole to fit the straw. This gives me a better angle when lighting it so I can see what I&#039;m doing. It also helps me control the intake of smoke.

And yeah, tooconscious, 50mg is a super small amount. It looks like a &quot;dash of salt&quot; actually.. :P except with a yellow hue... and the smell.. is sorta chloriney now that you mention it. Mine is atleast... but yeah<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sure by now you&#039;ve seen the magazine article with the Machine by doing a Google image search. That&#039;s how I learned to build and use mine. As for perfecting the method, now that&#039;s a different story. I use this type of steel mesh (hxxp://www.chemical-engineering.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/steel-wool6.jpg). I&#039;ve used copper stringy type before and it wasn&#039;t nearly as good. Also, dont use too much. About an inch to 3/4 in from the top of the bottle will do. Sprinkle the spice on top of the mesh ( the mesh should be level with the top of the bottle opening). Using a lighter (preferably a torch lighter) gently heat the neck of the bottle. I keep the flame about 2 inches away while slowly rotating the bottle. The spice on the top will slow melt into the mesh. I usually let it sit for a couple minutes. Then turn the bottle upside down, and put the lighter about an inch or two away from the steel and inhale. The indirect heat will vaporize the spice and billow the chamber with smoke. It&#039;s actually pretty simple. I&#039;ve fitted a 90 degree straw into the bottom hole (where you inhale) by filing the hole to fit the straw. This gives me a better angle when lighting it so I can see what I&#039;m doing. It also helps my control the intake of smoke.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep, I second that ... This is a pretty good description.<br />The only thing I do not do is pointing the machine downwards - with torch lighter you can smoke it at any angle :-)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Same here, it can be at times difficult to hold it downward, especially when you feel it start to kick in. Hell, most of the time it&#039;s hard to take multiple hits because you lose quite a bit of coordination. And with the fitting I have in place, using the pipe horizontally makes it much easier.

When I use a sandwich method with a bubbler I light the left side, hit it big, light the right side, hit it big, and light it in the middle and all over, and totally cash it.

				imo the easiest and best way is to sprinkle about 30-40mg on top of some marijuana, hold your lighter above the bowl and lower it slightly, do not put the fire to the material. i need at least 3 lungfuls to get where i need to go, 5 bitch slapped me, the lungfuls dont have to be held in like weed,i inhale and exhale the first 2 quickly, then hold longer on the 3rd or 4th which by that time i feel the transition. i am just saying you do not have to go buy a meth pipe or build the &quot;machine&quot; to breakthrough, it is not as difficult as some would have you believe.

				I&#039;m going to give my endorsement for the machine too. In my experience the vapor is almost odorless when done correctly, there is very little danger of burning something once you&#039;ve become intoxicated and it is extremely efficient. The best bottle to use is a single serve Hennessy bottle (single Drambuie bottles have the same wide round shape w/thin neck). Just make sure you are using copper wool that is NOT coated! The Chore Boy stuff is where it&#039;s at.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also used expensive stuff like Glass Vapor Genie and Essential Vape, but they still pale in comparison to the good ole DIY machine!

				thanks dmtisinme. great advice. <br /><br />The main reason I got discouraged from using the Machine was people were talking about toxic coatings or other harmful stuff. sandsnake, you mentioned using copper wool. are you absolutely certain this isn&#039;t harmful whatsoever when heat is applied?

				My machine that you can see on the first page is made with copper mesh... Just torch it for a bit&nbsp; and it should all be okay. :) You can even see the... eww stuff move off of the wire if you watch it close enough. I hope I don&#039;t die!

The issue here is typically steel cutting lubricants - nasty stuff!<br />I would not worry about not breaking thru or &quot;final&quot; toke. If you inhale slowly you do only need one toke. The vapour here is not nasty smelling, unless you point your torch lighter right onto your spice from a very short distance, so taking it in is easy, holding it in is easy too.<br /><br />On DMT-nexus forum there is how to with photos, etc ... Use it!<br /><br />Some observations on how it works and why, I think, the machine is superior to many other ways of smoking DMT:<br />1. Since DMT melts just above 105 Fahrenheit it also burns easily, so putting it onto fine steel mesh allows it to run away from the source of heat on a mesh without burning. So you get clean vapour without that horrible burned plastic smell.<br /><br />2. It&#039;s shape creates the fastest flow of air in the neck where mesh is and as soon as it hits the main bottle chamber it further slows downs and cools, so you do get easier experience<br />3. It is easy to load (just melt the spice into the mesh), close the cap and pop it into your pocket<br />4. It costs nothing to make<br />:-)

				How are your trials going, gents?<br /><br />I found this old thread that has some useful details on making the machine.<br />One of the tricks I am hearing works well is to fix the bottle bottom up in a flower pot in the wet dirt - this way it is fixed at the right angle, glass dust is going straight into the wet soil and if bottle breaks there is no big trouble for you to deal with. Your girlfriend might get pissed off though :-)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116969.msg825042#msg825042

				Meow,<br /><br />Here&#039;s my 2 cents, again...<br /><br />Spurred on by this very extensive thread, I went back to DMT this weekend for the first time in a year, and had a light, but magical reacquaintance, following a very tough 25i trip. It was the next day, so minimal interaction.<br /><br />I extracted my own DMT last year, and blended it with herbs to make changa, in a 1:1 ratio (so 1g of changa contains 0.5g DMT).<br /><br />I respectfully suggest you set the Machine aside for now, and go with a waterfall (aka fountain) bong. It will be easy to control, consume, and adjust to your tolerance. All you need is a 1 quart soda bottle, a gauze or mesh to fit the neck, and some dried herbs (weed, mint, parsley, whatever). The beauty of this method, especially for the beginner, is you separate the ignition stage from the blast-off stage&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Burn a thumb hole just above the base of the bottle, using a heated screwdriver. Fit the gauze onto the neck, shaping it into a bowl with your thumb to make it snug, but easy to remove. (You can also use a straight bong stem fitted into a cork instead, if you prefer a neater job, but this is not important.)<br /><br />Set the shaped gauze to one side, and into it place a decent pinch of herb. Sprinkle your chosen amount of DMT onto that (I would suggest about 30mg given your edginess...!) and then sprinkle some more herb on top to cover. I guarantee you are now set to consume exactly 30mg of DMT, no more, no less!<br /><br />Move over to the kitchen sink, it helps if the bottle can stand upright in it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re right-handed, use your left hand to block the thumb hole. Fill the bottle with cold water from the tap, up to about an inch from the top. Fit the loaded gauze back into the neck, and bring up the lighter (one which gives a decent long flame). <br /><br />When you&#039;re ready, lick the top layer of herb with the flame a couple of times, and release your thumb from the hole. This should be sufficient to start drawing lots of smoke into the bottle, from the smouldering herb. Only bring the flame back in contact if the stuff clearly goes out (turns black, stops glowing red).<br /><br />Depending on your apparatus, it should take about 30 seconds for the bottle to drain, which is plenty of time to make sure all your stuff has combusted/vaped.<br /><br />When the water level is down to the bottom, remove the gauze (carefully, it will be hot) and set aside quickly. Cap the top hole with your right hand and the bottom with your left,&nbsp; and give the bottle a quick shake to cool the smoke. Open both holes, and inhale the contents through the neck of the bottle. Aim for a long steady inhalation rather than a short quick one. You will cough however you do it, but fight to keep it all in for at least 5-10 seconds.<br /><br />Sit down very quickly and enjoy the fruits of your labors.<br /><br />Let us know how you get on...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				@Meow,<br /><br />I do get a bit of an anxiety every time I do it as well - it is a totally understandable reaction.<br /><br />Going into different types of bongs, etc is a matter of taste and I do not think it will be of value for me to argue for or against any of the methods proposed above by two honourable gentlemen ... chose one that gives you the best feel.<br /><br />On my first go and when I helped other people to try DMT for the first time I have always did a very small quantity to only reach some slight alterations to reality - visuals, some mild body load, etc ... this will give you a good feel for the nature of things. On my first try I took about 10mg and did not do it again that evening. Next day I have gone for a bit more until on 4th or 5th try I broke thru.<br /><br />As I mentioned, even now I do have a bit of an anxiety going for it, but some deep breathing, mediation and visualisations calm me down and let me go for it in a very good frame of mind.<br /><br />Also, many people do not recommend to have music, try to go for dark space ... I normally have one candle somewhere in line of sight as on small doses it does create beautiful warm feeling + drives really cool visuals.<br /><br />Go for it and do not try to blast off immediately and you will love it!

				Alright, guys. This weekend is definitely the weekend for something to happen. O.O I am supposed to be getting an order of some 25&#039;s in tomorrow. Really would like to try the DMT before that. So... plans I have are to sit in my closet (darkest room that I have) have a candle maybe at the other end of the closet (it is a long closet) and have some background music playing through my PC outside of my closet. Any music recommendations, also about what kind of dose do you think that I should attempt? I&nbsp; don&#039;t really have a scale or anything, so it looks like I&#039;m going to have to eyeball O.O (i know.. I know... go ahead tell me how much of a terrible person that I am and how newbie and everything) but... anything I am missing? anything you&#039;d like to tell me to do after I take the tokes?

				Great news fella, but do NOT feel like there&#039;s a gun at your back! If it&#039;s meant to be, you will find yourself in the right mind in the right place at the right time. <br /><br />I followed 25i (Sat, a lot) with DMT (Sun, a bit) for the first time last weekend and it was very excellent, so the order probably not critical.<br /><br />Music: minimum is best! The D usually has a noise/vibration all of it&#039;s own, and that&#039;s good to feel. Equally, the prep can be a bit nervy, so silence not ideal there. Just choose something mellow, non-vocal and quiet, that you can tune in or out of as you need to.<br /><br />Eyeballing, hmmm! The following is very rough guidance only, YMMV: the handle of a thin, cheap teaspoon is usually about 5mm wide. A thin layer of crystals covering the last 10mm of the handle will probably make about 50mg. Alternatively, if you empty a gel-cap, just filling the curved part at the very bottom of one half will be about 20mg. <br /><br />20mg should be about right for a novice, neither too strong nor weak. Just very pleasant, and manageable.<br /><br />After your smoke, get down quickly, and compare how things are with eyes open &amp; eyes closed. You won&#039;t be getting spanked at this level, and it won&#039;t last very long (15 mins?) so just enjoy it, don&#039;t even dream of activities or writing, just be. <br /><br />Thanks to all your pesky questions I have just re-opened my special little jar for the first time in about a year, and yeah, I wonder why I left it so long! Weirdly, the taste which used to gag me stupid is now hardly an issue. I think my anxiety must have drifted off, and I almost savor it now, like a weird cheese or strong garlic! Gracias&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Thank you for such an in depth post! Although, I am having a hard time grasping a visual of your 20mg method :) It seems like a reasonable dose to try out.. just to feel around and see how things are before I truly do blast off. could you please clear up the explanation for me? :)

				Here we go. Meowington&#039;s DMT trials #1. I tried my best to divide up the dmt into 4 separate stacks. I squared it and then cut to 4 squares... so here we go. 25mg (roughly) w/ The Machine (sorry I couldn&#039;t find any gauze laying around for the waterfall) I just hope the seller didn&#039;t include more in the bag... &gt;.&gt; that could be a problem. I have the music on that is from the video above.

				Excellent!<br /><br />25mg should have been quite pleasant...?!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />(FYI, just measured a &quot;standard&quot; gel-cap, it&#039;s it&#039;s 20mm long x 7mm wide. Yep, vertical, just enough to cover the inside of the curved &quot;tip&quot;) <br /><br />I&#039;m sure dividing up wasn&#039;t too far off the mark, but man, if you&#039;re playing with any more psychedelics, get a frickin scale. People occasionally end up in the loonybin guesstimating their shit!

				@Meow, how is it? First time for me was rather scary - the speed of onset and complete take-over without much chance for input or control were quite unsettling. If you felt that - not to worry.<br /><br />@Yoshi, very well put sir. +1

				Hey Meow, hope all went/is well for you in that strange and intruiging land.<br /><br />While the preparation for the trip has been thoroughly documented for you by incogmagnito and Yoshitoshi (primarily) I thought I would mention an alternative method for the actual vapourisation of the DMT. Many swear by the machine but I prefer a slightly simpler method.<br /><br />To whit - take one test tube with side arm, attach length of rubber tubing, place weighed dose in bottom of tube (I found a jewellers scale which can measure 1mg more than adequate) place a glass thistle funnel into the top and finally use a torch lighter and apply heat until the DMT melts then vapourises. Trapped in the bottom of the tube it cannot run away, the trick is to let the smoke hang in the tube for a second or 2 to allow it cool.<br />I have no idea if the stuff I used to extract was especially pure or if the method outlined is especially good for me but I never went above 45mg as this was absolutely uncontrollable hyperspace that threatened to tear asunder my very mind.<br /><br />Never hurts to clean your product either with recrystallisation or simple washing and evaporation with heptane or similar non-polar solvent. Burnt DMT tastes bad but its nothing compared to trying to smoke the extracted fats (especially if they have extracted it with the STB method when NaOH might be in there too). But I digress, from what I have seen on here the DMT available is cleaner than the raw extract so that&#039;s not really relevant.<br /><br />I&#039;ve entirely lost my train of thought now.<br />Hope you brought back some good knowledge from the other side<br />

				Well... I am not entirely sure what the heck happened last night. It was about 2:26 AM when I finally lit it... the smoke was fine. It didn&#039;t really taste like anything to me. It wasn&#039;t even hot either. It was just like white.. pure goodness. But. I belive the first toke had the most smoke in it and I accidentally blew it out WAYYY too fast. So, I didn&#039;t really get a trip at all (which i belive I should have maybe?) But yeah... nothing really happened which was quite depressing to me. I ended up taking more tokes and more tokes holding them in longer until i could see smoke and all, but I guess tolerance was already there, or there was just not enough DMT left. I will try again tonight with ~25mg again. I promise!

				Hey man, that&#039;s a real shame...<br /><br />White smoke sounds right, but the taste is almost always challenging to newcomers. Do your tastebuds definitely work OK?! Does your Machine still have a strong lingering odor of &quot;burnt plastic/robot garlic&quot; about it?<br /><br />Any buzzing or vibrations? Should happen with even the tiniest amount consumed. Tolerance spikes quickly, but lots of people can have an extended session with repeat tokes spaced 45-60 mins apart...

				Nope O.O I did feel like a small pressure buildup inside my head on my ears and stuff, but the spice didn&#039;t really taste bad at all. It is really hard to describe the smell... I can&#039;t physically get into the bottle, but it smells just like the unburnt DMT did.

				Somebody else posted here, or another thread, about their SR DMT not doing anything.<br /><br />You should maybe make sure you didn&#039;t use the same source, but if so, maybe some adverse publicity is warranted?<br /><br />You should definitely: recoil from the taste (unless you frequently smoke all sorts of mad shit) and get something, even from a mild hit, first time around.<br /><br />And look into doing your own extraction: it&#039;s very satisfying, powerful, and economical&nbsp; ;)

				Tried it with the sandwich method in my small bowl. Don&#039;t know if I didn&#039;t put enough in there, or if I just wasn&#039;t smoking it correctly but it wasn&#039;t to intense. I definitely didn&#039;t &#039;break through&#039; or anything. Just some very mild, but awesome visuals. I also had some very interesting aural hallucinations. First there was the weird paper crumbling/rushing sound, but then for the rest of the trip I just kept hearing the most beautiful music. I had this feeling that there was something waiting for me to &#039;crossover&#039;. Going to give it another go later tonight. I want to see what was waiting on the other side.<br /><br /><br />Can anyone give me an idea of what a 40ish mg dose would look like? I don&#039;t have a mg scale. It&#039;s free base, very fine powder.

				oh O.O... well it went very similar as the first try actually because the mesh fell down again, but I did try again this morning with 50mg instead of 25... and I made sure that the DMT was sitting on the edge this time. I lit it up and the smoke was actually quite harsh like I have been reading. I Was successful in getting 3 tokes in, but by that time my hands were shaking so bad I couldn&#039;t hold anything up anymore so I just collapsed on my pillow. I did get some psychedelic visuals, and they were actually quite interesting. I saw a strange... human like figure kicking me in the bottom left of my vision and every time he kicked me my arm would twitch O.O but... it didn&#039;t seem like it lasted that long at all. After I was able to get up finally, I looked at my machine and noticed that I only vaporized about half of it O.O I am not sure why the other side didn&#039;t get the heat... but oh well. this was probably why I didn&#039;t get full effects. :p I was in pitch black, so it was somewhat hard to see. There is definitely enough left for a similar trip. I am just going to have to keep practicing with holding in the smoke, and taking more tokes as needed. :) I would definitely say result this time!

				So I botched my first DMT smoking; and the stuff did end up working for a friend so I&#039;m presuming it&#039;s just me.<br /><br />I have more on the way and plan to extract some myself. My first smoking method was putting the DMT at the bottom of a test tube, sealing it with a rubber stopper that had a straw run through it, then holding a flame below but not touching the tube. DMT did vape, I got some in me but it didn&#039;t hurt. Exhaled, it didn&#039;t work. I tried repeating this, didn&#039;t work again.<br /><br />Stupidly I tried again two days later, with the same method; Again, felt absolutely nothing.<br /><br />What I&#039;m thinking happened is that some of the DMT accumulated on the sides of the tube and burnt or hardened; some crystalline structures did form along it. Therefore, my first inhale wasn&#039;t enough to get me off the ground (or high at all) yet lead to me building tolerances, which&#039;d explain also why trying another dose did nothing.<br /><br />I was also only roughly two weeks off of Seroquel, a serotonin acting drug.<br /><br />ANYWAYS, I&#039;m curious what methods you might suggest I try. I&#039;d make a machine from a little Monster M3 bottle (seems they&#039;d be perfect, albeit the beverage itself isn&#039;t worth the premium price) but I unfortunately lack a drill. Feel free to castrate me at your leisure.<br /><br />It seems that nowhere that accepts currencies I can use is in stock of Eagle Bill&#039;s Vaporizer Pipe– I was considering buying one, sticking some steel mesh in there and seating the dmt on it. Seems like it&#039;d do the job.<br /><br />For now, I&#039;ve got a small hookah and some screens; I was considering burning some parsley/oregano or whatnot, placing the ashes at the bottom of the bowl, placing some dmt, then placing more parsley/oregano on top. Do you think this would work? I could always get some local bud but I&#039;d prefer the DMT unadulterated.

				Well, you don&#039;t necessarily need a drill. I just used a screwdriver and hit it with a hammer... It didn&#039;t break too much off, but if a lot does break off, you can always tape it up:) I use a straw, so the cut doesn&#039;t really make a difference to me.

				I still reckon you only need to look at making a Machine once you&#039;ve decided that yes, you would like to go deep into the DMT experience. To me, it&#039;s a bit strange not to even extract your own spice, yet make a custom rig for it...<br /><br />If you&#039;ve only scored a bit, and just want to try it quickly/easily, the waterfall option is much easier, much quicker, and a lot cheaper. You won&#039;t waste nearly so much cuz you&#039;ll be operating the flame before inhaling anything.<br /><br />Is this thread starting to eat itself?! To have a new and &quot;unsuccessful&quot; Machine user advising another novice to also try and make something which didn&#039;t actually work very well for them anyway, seems a little convoluted no? If this catches on, an awful lot of DMT will end up getting wasted, and that&#039;s no good!

				As far as I know the best way to do DMT is to sandwich the chemical inbetween some herbs and bong it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard from people that oil pipes work well but I&#039;d imagine it might be hard to get the full hit out of it.

DMT did vape, I got some in me but it didn&#039;t hurt. Exhaled, it didn&#039;t work. I tried repeating this, didn&#039;t work again.<br /><br />Stupidly I tried again two days later, with the same method; Again, felt absolutely nothing.<br /><br />What I&#039;m thinking happened is that some of the DMT accumulated on the sides of the tube and burnt or hardened; some crystalline structures did form along it. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think I can see why your vaping method might not have worked though I don&#039;t know if this is related to the failure to lift off.<br /><br />If the only entry point the tube is the straw you are breathing in through you will very quickly create a vacuum in the tube and getting the vapour will get harder and harder the more you try. Put another straw in the stopper to allow a proper air flow (make it short - not that you&#039;ll lose much up it but it never hurts). If you leave the vapour in the tube for too long it will condense out on the cooler sides of the tube so try a flame lighter to keep it hot. The best way to break through is to vape all the DMT in the tube and draw it all in at once while keeping the lighter going to stop it coming out on the sides. Fair warning though, taking it all in one is pretty intense. Most people here tend to take several tokes to get up to speed.<br />Each to their own.
