				So recently got 3g of Chem bro&#039;s MDMA and 10 tabs of 25i from kwiktrip. I planned on at least doing MDMA tomorrow, but I feel that 25i would synergize VERY well with it. I was thinking maybe 120-150mg with a couple of 550ug complexed tabs. Has anyone else tried this? I can&#039;t find too much info on the web on how they will mix. Would rather miss a dangerous interaction, or wasting one of them because the other will overpower it.

				I tried this recently- however I&#039;m not 100% sure it was MDMA or Methylone- It felt a lot speedier than mdma.&nbsp; Also at some point I did some DMT as well sooooo- It was awesome for awhile I started hanging out with some friends, came home attempted to do some work, went out to an underwater themed bar (milf central) smoked a blunt there, was having a ball- so damn chatty and happy with life, plus that bar is naturally trippy.&nbsp; It was great through that point.&nbsp; (i had probably 15omg of the suspect molly at this moment), by this time I realized Id be pulling an all nighter to finish what I needed to get done- took a medium sized dip when I got in started working on a presentation I had to do- got half way through that before cracking myself up about something on the screen.&nbsp; Then i smoked a bowl but had forgotten I put DMT in it- and thats when things got weird.<br /><br />It was the best party ive ever been to though.&nbsp; Couches turned into funky dancing bears, this boat in the corner was a girafee smoking a ciggy- neon everything, my living room has never been so exciting.&nbsp; The inital &#039;holy fuck this is awesome wore off&#039; I was definatly still tripping though tried writing the rest of the paper and couldnt concentrate, decided to try and clean my car, but then my heart started racing a little and my stomach started to turn.&nbsp; So i was like Ill lay down for an hour. That turned into an hr and half of me tossing and turning trying to slow my heart rate.&nbsp; Luckily my presentation got canceled and i got to lay low all day.&nbsp; But thats what makes me feel like it was not molly- it felt a lot like methylone and others who had tried it said the same thing, so you may have just read a report of 25i + methylone- but there it is my night attempting this mixture.&nbsp; I feel itll be an allright mix just dont go over board on either on- your ratios seemed fine, you&#039;ll probably have an awesome time.&nbsp; I say go for it!

				I combined the two this weekend.&nbsp; I took about 500mg of MDMA total (hey, it wasn&#039;t pure like the stuff off SR&nbsp; :-[) and only one 550ug tab.&nbsp; It was an AMAZING night.&nbsp; They do synergize really well, however, my friend and I both kept feeling like the NBOMe overpowered the roll.&nbsp; So if I were you I would either take the NBOMe first, and then drop the molly, or wait a few hours into your roll after you&#039;ve gotten everything out of it that you want to, then apply the tabs.&nbsp; Either way, with music, friends, dance music, refreshments, and glowsticks, you&#039;ll have an amazing time!&nbsp; Take a walk at night, too.&nbsp; Especially if you live in a city.&nbsp; It&#039;s magical.&nbsp; ;D
