				i was just wondering why people chose to use seroquel on occasion to come of stimulants instead of something like xanax or valium?<br /><br />as its an anti-psychotic i just wasnt keen on the idea of it.. doctor gave me some a while back for depression and i learned the company behind&nbsp; seroquel got a massive fine from the us FDA for pushing it for depression when it wasnt even approved for that usage.. it was a clea cut case of big pharma drugging up cunts and even my doctor was in on it.. So i never even tried them (i had xr&#039;s anyway) and ditched them.<br /><br />i know some may use it due to being against benzos but there is just something i find spooky about taking anti-psychotics to go to sleep after the stims<br /><br /><br /><br />only thing i like about them is their nickname...&quot;snoozeberries&quot;... fucken LOL *slaps thigh with hand and LOLs repeatedly*

				My best friend takes 1700mg every night to go to sleep. I tried 1/3 pill one night, and felt sick, then just *poof* was waking up in a haze 7 hours later. I felt very grouchy and miserable, and couldn&#039;t find my speed stash. So I just got angrier. <br /><br />I eventually found my amph gear, that I use in place of brand Adderall. I then looked up what Seroquell does. <br />It shuts down your dopamine receptors. No wonder it feels like shit!!<br /><br />No thanks. I don&#039;t hear voices, so right there, the drug is not for me. I love how Big Pharma finds a way to use their shitty latest drug for other diagnosis. Risperdal for sleep? I would never go back to a doctor who even made that suggestion. Well I don&#039;t go to doctors anymore, so that solves that. ;D<br /><br />Living well. is the best revenge!<br /><br />Chip&nbsp;

				I was given it at a hospital when I was checked in for talking about killing myself. It made me trip, but not in a fun way. When I turned the lights on and off it would create super strong visuals. There black webs everywhere in the dark and in the light the floor tiles were turning into bees and giraffes. I seriously wondered why they were giving it to me for sleep because I didn&#039;t sleep a wink on it. I did however feel the urge to lay down and couldn&#039;t get up, but it wasn&#039;t relaxing or restful in anyway. <br /><br />It does make you sleepy and trippy so maybe that&#039;s why it&#039;s so popular. I never bothered picking up my prescription for it though. If I can make money off it I might though. I take trazadone which knocks your ass out and causes insanely fun dreams though.

				This is one of the shittest drugs I can think of. I&#039;m sure it has some use, maybe in combo with something else, but man...<br /><br />Took a 300mg of generic Seroquel on an empty stomach.<br /><br />30 minutes later, I physically felt the symptoms of really deep sleep. Lead arms, legs and head. Really hard to move.<br /><br />The fucked up thing was that it left my brain completely awake.<br /><br />It was the closest feeling to being in a proper full on vegetative state I can imagine.<br /><br />

				I can tell you first hand why i think it might have some popularity - Idiots. A friend offered this to me once, saying &quot;Hey, want a bi-polar tablet?!&quot;. He got them off a friend, who had them for legit reasons. <br /><br />So, my conclusion, is that idiots think that because some medications that are associated with treating various types of depression are used recreationally.... they must all be fucking fantastic.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				I sleep walked on this stuff after I used it to make me sleep after Meth. Seroquel gives you a serious hangover to due to it&#039;s long half life , serious sedating maybe good for serious insomnia though no better then xanax. It is prescribed easily here in Australia and is generic so it costs very cheap now it is nowhere near as hard to get as Xanax. I got prescribed Ritalin easier then Xanax and the GP couldn&#039;t even prescribe Ritalin but he didn&#039;t know.<br /><br />Neither did the pharmacist as they still handed to me for &quot;narcolepsy&quot;. Finished the 10mg XR in a weekend , was a nice treat.

				I suppose seroquel isn&#039;t that popular at all, regardless of what end you insert it into. <br /><br />It is fairly commonly prescribed in some countries though, as and antipsychotic and even as a sleep aid. <br /><br />I see no recreational use for them however. For some they may prove to be an effective hypnotic, but there are better choices when it comes to that... at least where side effects are a factor.

Antihistamines if there&#039;s nothing else, doxylamine is the best out of all antihistamines for sleep, it works great and the hangover isn&#039;t half as bad as with seroquel or mirtazapine even though it&#039;s still annoying...

				For those of us with sleep issues, Seroquel is one of the very few drugs that knocks you out- a solid sleep for 8-10 hours. It has side effects like sleep walking, sleep eating, etc. And the sleep can be crappy filled with nightmares- but its sleep.<br /><br />IMHO - its an awful drug. I took it for insomnia as nothing else worked - altho I also took Lunesta and Xanax - neither of those alone put me to sleep. It makes you gain weight and then you have to ween off of it or go thru withdrawals.

Try zolpidem 10mg&#039;s or lormetazepam 2mg&#039;s. <br /><br />Seroquel is so popular because of incorrect info about them. Some people claim it works like cocaine when snorting low doses (about 25-50mgs). Actually it is terrible to snort them.<br /><br />They are used in prisons a lot because nothing else is available. And because people think it works like coke while actually it works in totally the opposite way.<br /><br />Depending on what dosage used it does help with sleep or as an antipsychotic which it is. But, also depending on dosage, it will make you want to eat a lot and makes you fat and apathic...<br /><br />It&#039;s quite good for GHB withdrawal....

				I fucking hate Seroquel. A lot of the experiences reported in this thread are totally alien to me. I took it for bipolar (for about 2 years, a high dose) and while it treated the symptoms and I was able to sleep, it robbed me of the ability to do anything else. I&#039;ve never felt such utter, total apathy. I couldn&#039;t work, I couldn&#039;t leave the house, if I hadn&#039;t had someone looking out for me, I wouldn&#039;t have bothered eating. It also blew me up like a balloon. I put on so much weight. When I stopped taking them I lost 2 stone in as many months.<br /><br />I suppose they did the job because I&#039;m still here but if I was offered them again I&#039;d throw them back in the doc&#039;s face. They might be good for the odd nights sleep but I would urge anyone not to take them regularly.

				At least bipolar disorder actually IS a proper indication to prescribe seroquel for. I presume the side effects were bad enough to not want to repeat the experience for you, but at least it was prescribed for its proper indication. <br /><br />I&#039;ve come to understand that a large amount of seroquel prescriptions are now for elderly patients with alzheimers that get aggressive at times. This seems as abuse to me - similar to giving them haldol to the&nbsp; point where they are simple unable to complain about anything let alone get out of bed. <br /><br />As a sleep aid its probably about as good as sniffing a rag soaked in chloroform: its more or less guaranteed to be effective, but chances of regretting it the next day are fairly high, unless you get the same treatment as soon als you realize what actually happened. <br /><br />

It sounds like a cheaper alternative to training staff to deal with aggressive patients if you ask me. My grandmother is in the middle stages of alzheimers. If I hear they&#039;ve even suggested she take quetiapine I will throw a fit.<br /><br />The sleep thing is interesting actually as I seem to be in minority here. I can&#039;t remember exactly what my dose was but it was the highest they&#039;re allowed to prescribe for bipolar. I found the soporific effects to be quite natural. If I took them at a reasonable time and made sure I was in bed before they kicked in, sleep was pretty good. I was still able to dream and in the morning I wasn&#039;t any worse than I was the rest of the day. It was probably just being on them for so long but I found them to be a more natural treatment for insomnia than zopiclone or diazepam.

When my family found me I was burying furniture in the garden and talking to angels in the trees. They confronted me and I broke my brothers nose and ran for it. There was a whole heap of other stuff. Apparently I jumped out of a car doing about 60mph while they were trying to get me to the hospital. Dark stuff.<br />

Really hard to move.<br /><br />The fucked up thing was that it left my brain completely awake.<br /><br />It was the closest feeling to being in a proper full on vegetative state I can imagine.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Yeah you nailed it! When I took it in the hospital for sleep problems, I never slept a wink and every night I could barely move in bed but was wide awake mentally. They tried to tell me I went to sleep but didn&#039;t remember it which is a bunch of bullshit.

				300&nbsp; mg is an awful lot if it anyway. In clinical practice people that suffer from psychosis are usually prescribed about 50 mg doses, perhaps twice a day in severe cases.<br /><br />Taking a dose like 300 mg when you are not used to this drug will in the very best scenario just knock you out for a day or so. This is the optimal scenario though, taking such large amounts may leave you in a state where you are to some degree aware of what is going around you, but unable to communicate. <br /><br />To me it seems like a very last resort drugs to deal with insomnia - try benzo&#039;s or barbiturates first, and if those bring no relieve, i&#039;d still suggest consulting a physician before resorting to seroquel.

				I have a short attention-span so I didn&#039;t read through all the replies.<br /><br />I hate Seroquel. I think some doctors feel more comfortable prescribing Seroquel for insomnia (than benzodiazepines).<br />When that&#039;s offered to me - though with me, lately it&#039;s been as a last resort - I&#039;m like /fuck that shit/. I&#039;d rather not sleep.<br />Sure, I will continue to feel like utter crap but at least I won&#039;t feel zombified (or forced-&quot;compliant&quot;) on top of that.<br />When I can&#039;t sleep, I can&#039;t sleep. Seroquel is not the answer. Though I&#039;ve only tried, what, 25mg-100mg doses. But still.

				I was coming cold turkey off A LOT of Xanax and couldn&#039;t sleep, go figure. <br />Anyway a mate gave me 10 200mg Seroquel in a blister too aid me and 1 5mg Valium.<br />Came night 3 I wanted sleep, so I remember what my mate said and only have 1 Seroquel.<br /><br />T2:00 Nothing, not a thing. Surprised but I reach for 2 more, this should work.<br /><br />T4:00 Feel odd, can tell it&#039;s got a trippy mindset, but I don&#039;t trip easy nor sleep apparently, I take 2 more. <br />I repeat this until there all gone. <br /><br />T10:00 Shocked at how its failed to make me sleep but now I&#039;m left in more of an exhausted state, but In a way that did not induce sleep. Odd ?<br /><br />T14:00 I take the 1 Valium and pass out in 45 minutes :P

				Apparently it does not have much hypnotic action on you, despite the very large dose. <br /><br />I suppose the sleep deprivation caused you to fall asleep that quickly regardless of the small amount of valium you took. Taking such high doses may just result in paradoxical effects though, perhaps you would have been sound asleep after taking only 1 tablet, but downing the whole strip overnight ruined that. <br /><br />In any case, seroquel is a bit of a last resort when in comes to hypnotics. It was not designed or approved for that function, and may or may not work for any individual. When (combined) substances like benzo&#039;s/barbiturates and alcohol do not put you to sleep you actually have a condition that would require real medical attention. <br /><br />Obviously there are substances that will induce sleep in any case, but in severe cases those cannot be used without proper medical supervision. Substances that come to mind are IV haldol or propofol, but there is no way to use those outside a hospital environment safely. <br />

				Seroquel really knocks me out. I know people who take like 1500mg a day. For me personally 25mg will have me fall to sleep in no time. Maybe my system is hypersensitive but this stuff knocks me out every time. The first time I took it I was in bed and couldn&#039;t move my legs. The reason why it&#039;s&nbsp; so popular is the fact that it is not addictive i guess. Way better than to be hooked on benzos to come down on stims.

				I would not count on that non-addictive property though.<br /><br />Perhaps it does not cause cravings like some people get for bezodiazpines, but if you use seroquel long term to fall asleep dependence is certainly a risk. You will probably not find yourself hunting for seroquel like a junky does for heroin, but chances are that you will not able to fall asleep properly without it after some time. In itself this is not dangerous in terms of resulting from withdrawal that actually causes illness, but being unable to sleep for a couple of night will seriously wreck most people regardless of the cause.&nbsp;
