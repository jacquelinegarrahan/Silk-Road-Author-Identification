				Not sure if everyone is aware, however, some news articles were released recently stating that &quot;k-2&quot; and &quot;Spice Gold&quot; and other brands of &quot;synthetic marijuana&quot; brands have just concluded after a trend [a slight trend, in my opinion] has shown that they may be linked to severe kidney damage. <br /><br />Now I assume they&#039;re talking about JWH-018, considering this was the first synthetic cannaboid to hit the market and is generally associated with those brands in particular. If this would pose a concern to you, I can only say the only &#039;safe&#039; thing to do about it would to be to quit consuming this chemical. I won&#039;t advocate that for you should draw your own conclusions about how to treat your own body.<br /><br />In the news articles, there are no specific chemicals names of the JWH variants cited, so I can&#039;t say for sure whether other JWH chemicals should be included in this. But it&#039;s just something to keep in your mind as you use these chemicals.<br /><br />The article states that 16 people have been hospitalized with progressed damage and one of those individuals now requires dialysis. However, from personal experience I have used jwh-018 literally for 3 years now and I have had a trend of intense and sharp stomach pains along the way that weren&#039;t there before. Needles to say that if these facts are true then it would explain a lot. However I do concur that a sample of less than 20 individuals, or less than 500 individuals for that matter, is too small of a sample for an accurate experiment.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I encourage you all to do your own research and draw your own conclusions and make your own decisions. Personally, I haven&#039;t decided to stop yet, but it&#039;s a serious consideration on my part. JWH is some good shit, in my opinion, but dialysis and dying is an even worse alternative.<br /><br />Stay safe friends.<br />-PH<br /><br /><br /><br />Article:<br /><br />A new report links the use of synthetic cannabinoids, which are sold under the names of &quot;synthetic marijuana,&quot; &quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;K2,&quot; with kidney damage.<br /><br />Sixteen cases of acute kidney injury were reported in 2012 in six states after people smoked the synthetic marijuana, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#039;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report out today. The patients became sick within days and sometimes even hours after smoking. Their symptoms included nausea and vomiting as well as abdominal and flank pain. They were found to be in various stages of kidney failure. The cases were reported in Kansas, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wyoming.<br /><br />Synthetic cannabinoids are designer drugs dissolved in a solvent, applied to plant material and then smoked. They can mimic the effects of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Even though the products are often sold as incense and labeled &quot;Not for consumption,&quot; some people still smoke them as an alternative to marijuana. <br /><br />These drugs have been linked to health problems such as agitation, hallucinations and rapid heart rates, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<br /><br />Michael Schwartz, a co-author of the report, says, &quot;Synthetic cannabinoids are not safe alternatives to marijuana. There are unexpected and unpredictable health problems that can occur.&quot;<br /><br />Schwartz, a medical officer in the CDC&#039;s National Center for Environmental Health, adds, &quot;The availability of the synthetic cannabinoid products, coupled with how rapidly the chemicals present in the various products change, really creates a recipe for a public health disaster.&quot;

				JWH-018 is a full cannabinoid receptor agaonist, whereas THC is a partial agonist.&nbsp; Not sure how this might relate to kidney damage, but it does make a difference.

				Man... I tried JWH-018 a couple weeks ago. Just to satisfy my curiosity. I have never thrown a drug away so fast in my life.I had the stuff for a few days before I bothered to mess with it. It was the pure powder I got just because it was cheaper.<br />&nbsp;<br />I heard you could put a little on the end of a cigarette, but I wasn&#039;t getting anything even with 1MG on it. So I thought I would try vaping it, maybe that would be more effective. I grabbed a piece of foil and started with a little less than 1MG. <br /><br />It wasn&#039;t that easy to vape. JWH liquifies really fast and runs easy, but I was still getting some vapor. I wasn&#039;t feeling anything yet so I added just a little more. Still not feeling it. I put a little more on the foil. Now at this point, I probably have 2MGs on the foil, but I thought I had already vaped most of it. It suddenly melts into a little pool of yellow liquid and really gives me a good hit I can feel. I&#039;m starting to feel a little stoned as I go for a second hit. When I blew that second hit out I was fucked up. My heart was racing, my arms and hands felt numb, I thought I was having a heart attack. I opened the bag of JWH and dumped it into the trash about 90 seconds later. <br /><br />The panic lasted for around 30 minutes. After I calmed down I had the worst cotton mouth ever and it felt ok. Much like Weed, but the effects wore off very fast. I don&#039;t think I will be smoking this stuff again.

				To the above, I dont think you have JWH=018... the stone lasts a good 4-6 hours.&nbsp; The body has THC receptors in the brain and in the liver.&nbsp; 1 mg is way more than enough to have you unmistakable stoned out of your gourd within 30 seconds of start of inhale.&nbsp; That said, it was originally synthesized in approximately 1989 and Mr. Nichols probably has some undisclosed research as for why it never got further than initial synthesis.<br />The spice products (all of them) are garbage containing many carcinogens (even assuming JWH is a carcinogen)

				I am not sure about the long term health effects of it, and I hate people that pretend like they are. (not saying any of you did)<br />I smoked spice for a while and I loved it, occasionally everyone gets to high off of it and may freak out, but that,s because people try to smoke it like its weed, or try to smoke the pure powder. If you buy some thats already been sprayed on leaves and smoke like a hit a time you will actually feel great.<br />It probably isn&#039;t good for you, but I enjoy it, and I get drug tested.

				Not from a study, just my personal experience...<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked very little synthetic weed, all stuff bought from various seedy head shops. Judging from the different effects, they contained a variety of chemicals, not just JWH-018.<br /><br />The first time that I smoked it, I smoked every day or two for about a week, which was followed by two weeks of the worst diarrhea of my life even after I stopped smoking it. I had to crap every few hours, sometimes even woke up in the middle of the night and had to run to the toilet. I&#039;ve smoked some since then and the diarrhea hasn&#039;t returned, but it was still a nasty experience.<br /><br />I have friends though who have been smoking this for almost two years, on an almost daily basis. Lately a few of them have been smoking several times a day, sometimes going through a 25g bag in one week. Two of them feel that it has affected their memory, and that they have trouble recalling simple everyday things. They recently decided to stop smoking synthetic weed, and have been off it for a few weeks already although they don&#039;t feel any change yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m reluctant to try much further with these chemicals until there&#039;s better research on their effects.<br /><br /><br />Of course, the high from the more powerful stuff was amazing. Not every brand got me high (some were just like crap weed), but I found one brand which gave me a high waaaay higher than weed, for over an hour. The downside was intense paranoia each time it first came up, but afterwards I&#039;d just zone out for an eternity.
