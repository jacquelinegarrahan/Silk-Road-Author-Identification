				1st - Years ago, I was listening to a radio DJ interview a famous guitarist of the time.&nbsp; He said that he only ever skin popped heroin with the needle and never directly IV injected.<br /><br />Is that type of high better than snorting?<br /><br />I assume it would not have been a total waste or this person would not have done it for years.<br /><br />2nd - If a person were to smoke H, would you put it on top of cigarette ashes in a typical pipe, or is &#039;traying&#039; the method of those who smoke it.<br /><br />Just curious..

				Also known as &quot;IntraMuscular Injection&quot; or IM Injection.<br /><br />Now, armed with this knowledge, go back and look at the threads in this forum.

				I may be wrong, but I was under the impression that skin popping was an intradermal injection? The name referring to the small bump that forms in the skin after injecting.

				Skin popping is injecting just under the outer most layer of skin; not into a muscle. The high would be better than snorting in so far as you get a much higher bioavailability, but there wouldn&#039;t be a rush like you would get from IV.<br /><br />However, there is a significant risk of developing an abscess, especially with street drugs.

				Please don&#039;t do this technique.&nbsp; It causes horrible wounds/abscesses.
