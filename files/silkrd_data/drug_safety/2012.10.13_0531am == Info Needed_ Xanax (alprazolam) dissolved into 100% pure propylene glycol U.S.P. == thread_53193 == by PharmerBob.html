				I have 15mL dropper bottle that is calibrated at 22 drops = 1mL. I would like to make each drop = 1mg. Can100% pure propylene glycol U.S.P. dissolve 20mg of xanax in 1ml of liquid. I would basically be doing 4x bottles @ 220mg in 11mL out of a gram. So can 100% pure propylene glycol U.S.P. dissolve 220mg of alprazolam in 11mL of ethanol liquid?

				Alprazolam is well soluble in both ethanol and methanol, 22 grams per liter wouldn&#039;t be a problem of either solvent.<br /><br />I&#039;m not familiar with everclear though. If I presume it is 95% ethanol and 5% water i don&#039;t foresee any problems. <br /><br />That is assuming you are dissolving pure alprazolam (powder), not tablets that contain it since those will have plenty of other substances in them that may not prove soluble at the desired concentration.

				obviously dont use methanol if youre using it as a solvent to be ingested<br /><br />id strongly recommend you make the solution less concentrated which means less error when measuring doses. having such a concentrated solution is much more dangerous<br /><br />if you put 1 mg per .5 or 1 ml then its much easier to dose correctly, just add it to a drink and enjoy - but still not enough alcohol to matter unless you have a ridiculous tolerance. with such a concentrated solution there is greater risk overdosing if and extra drop or two gets added or the solution isnt uniform concentration<br /><br />when using volumetric measurement it is extremely important the give the molecules time to thoroughly disperse in solution, or else you will get weak doses and dangerous hot spots...&nbsp; i know from experience after making my own liquid caps with alp some years ago&nbsp;

				Obviously methanol should never be ingested. It can be a useful solvent to make aliquots or blotters though, and poses no danger if it s evaporated off before the final product is completed.<br /><br />Also, methanol is not insanely toxic or anything like that. You could relatively safely ingest up to the order of 1 gram a day without ill effects. The stories of methanol causing blindness, insanity and even death are mostly from liquor that contains methanol instead of ethanol, where people ingest dozens of grams of it on a single evening, and sometimes for several evenings in a row. <br /><br />The risks of getting small amounts of methanol in your system are minimal though - its frequently used to wipe things clean in a laboratory setting, and wearing gloves doing so is done to prevent fingers getting into the sample, not for preventing methanol getting on your fingers.

				there are people who are not aware of the dangers, and the reason i mentioned was for harm reduction<br /><br />i dont really agree with you but you are entitled to your opinion - maybe you have a different idea of what exactly it means to be &quot;highly toxic.&quot; i certainly would never ingest ANY amount of methanol <br /><br />a source i found indicated as little as two teaspoons can kill a child. only 10 ml can cause permanent blindness in adults and as little as 30 ml can be fatal. to me, these are small amounts. not only that but you dont even have to consume it orally, because it can be absorbed through the skin and even inhaled vapors can be harmful. for this reason i dont think it is a wise choice for a solvent for the purpose of dissolving alp<br /><br />http://www.medicinejournal.co.uk/article/S1357-3039%2807%2900324-6/abstract<br /><br />i have also worked in microbio and pharmacology labs for a number of years, and i have never once seen methanol used for disinfecting/cleaning - but maybe we live in different countries with different safety regulations and procedures

				I use propylene glycol, its just as soluble but doesn&#039;t have the burning sensation of ethanol.<br />I put 75mg of alpraz. in 15 ml of glycol. The dropper holds half a ml which equals 5mg each time i fill the dropper.<br />But if you have a lower tolerance you of course could dissolve 30mg in the bottle and the half ml dropper would be 1ml per dropper.<br />I ended up with sores in my mouth after a bottle or 2 of the ethanol, just a suggestion.

				well I need to at least fit 22mg of xanax into 1mL of solvent. Where do I get prop glycol stuff? Can I fit 22mg alprazolam into 1mL of PG or 330mg into 15mL basically. My dropper specifically states 22 drops = 1mL. It is very simple to control the drops and I need 5mg of xanax before I even start to feel the effects. I usually dose around 8-10mg before bed when I need sleep, ill take even more if i cant sleep because of psychedelic use. 1mg per drop is the most convenient for me, don&#039;t really need people telling me its dangerous or to make it weaker or to even tell me i cant use the tablets, really why would i crush tablets and turn them into a dropper when they are already dosed out?<br /><br />Basically I need someone to tell me whats the max solubility ratio of pure alprazolam to propylene glycol? Will 330mg dissolve into 15mL without issue? where can I buy pure lab grade propylene glycol?

				Got a High quality calibrated medicine dropper made of borosilicate glass. So now 20 drops = 1mL. Can I dissolve 20mg of alprazolam in 1mL of 100% pure propylene glycol?

				Why won&#039;t anyone give out the solubility numbers of alprazolam dissolved in propylene glycol? I&#039;ll take per mL or per L. I can do the math after that. Who do I have to give a blow job to get the solubility numbers?
