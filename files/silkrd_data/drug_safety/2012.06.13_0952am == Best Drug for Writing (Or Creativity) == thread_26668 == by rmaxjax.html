				Writing when I&#039;m stoned would be pure frustration as I forgot every thought mid sentence. I&#039;ve written while tripping before, but it&#039;s highly disorganized but might be good for brainstorming, especially about feelings and emotion. To actually functionally write, I&#039;d say adderall would be far and away the best bet.<br /><br />Historically, many writers, artists and other creative persons used opium rather heavily so that could be another option.

If you consistently need more than that, you probably await a short-lived (and disappointing) career as a writer. You can suggest the (uncheckable) popular claim that most writers use some sort of substance to aid in their endeavors, but I firmly believe that substance or not, no writing comes easy, and is rather the result of 99% perspiration. <br /><br />That said...<br />Oral methamphetamine is great, as is cannabis. With a lot of heavier psychedelics, it&#039;s too often that we write works which in the moment seem to be absolute genius, but upon returning to sobriety, we fail to see the magic in them again. Opiates and the pipe dreams they engender, should not be ignored either.

				There was a TED.com video about how depressants allow you to think more abstractly since your mind is relaxed and thinking freely, whereas stimulants actually hinder creativity and shift your brain into more of a focused, narrow way of thinking.<br /><br />Think of Archimedes when he had his famous &quot;Eureka!&quot; moment. He was chillin in a bathtub, super relaxed. Richard Feynman used to write physics equations on napkins while getting drunk in strip clubs. <br /><br />Basically, if you are looking for that creative &quot;flash&quot;, I would say use alcohol or opiods to relax your mind and body and let your brain wander free. Save the stimulants for when you have a project in which you know exactly what you are doing and you just need focus.<br />

				I would recommend speed of any kind, pills, adderall, meth etc.<br /><br />I find that I can get the most ideas out while I&#039;m tweaked but they need to be edited in a sober state later.

				Any cannabis or by products (hash, oil, jelly, crystal or whatever)<br /><br />Speed, some way not but I found I could easily cope with speed though I liked to go out when high and write when coming down bit still wide awake. Not used speed for years.<br /><br />Years ago a nasty accident on site saw me on morphine. I can get dihydro-codeine and been on that for years. It is useful for writing. I would imagine heroin would be good but I will never use heroin because why play with the one drug that really is a bitch! So - no H. Opium I would try. Seen some here. Seems to be the type we eat and not smoke. i want the latter.<br /><br />Cocaine? No way! Its not that type of drug for me. But never tried because if you got to spend £80 before you can even write its bad news! Coke is sociable drug only for me. <br /><br />Mushrooms, well, if you are coming down you got a few hours in which you can be creative. OK - what you write might be bullshit but you got to try and every diamond we find takes a few tons of dirt to sift through.<br /><br />I also think alcohol needs to be bought to our attention. Can be great -especially when really drunk. If you can actually type or write then its all good stuff. <br /><br />LSD - comedown only - same as mushrooms. A window is there. You need to be alone and have space.<br /><br />Eating hash is or was one of my favorite things to do! After my evening meal - an hour later, at 6.00pm i would make a cup of coffee infused with hash. Usually 2 grams. Depended on the hash. Eat hash and you might be able to have a nice night in writing. Sit back and chill and let the creativity flow. <br /><br />Tobacco. It helps. Sometimes in the daytime I might think &#039;lets be sober&#039; and smoke a cigarette. <br /><br />There is no &#039;best&#039; drug for writing really. You got to want to do that sober and be able to write sober. After all most work in which writing skills are needed is hardly calling for too much creativity! You do not need cocaine to write some blurb. I write sober.<br /><br />Stephen King wrote a few of his early books high on coke. <br /><br />If I could do that on amphetamine I would do it - because if something helps the &#039;art&#039; then an artiste will generally take that help. We got to be careful though. The road to artistic acclaim abnd reward is littered with the casualties. <br /><br />Drugs help you experiment. they help you &#039;see things&#039; in a different light. Each drug in a different way. But a writer draws from life experiences. He or she ought to immerse themselves in social situations. Meet people. <br /><br />Drugs is just part of writing for some writers. <br /><br />If for example I was asked to write up some lengthy advertising shit for some product or service my place of employment offers - I could do it sober.<br /><br />If asked to write up a catalog of thousands of products then I might use some amphetamine for the tedious writing in bulk situation.<br /><br />If writing a children&#039;s book an idea may have been generated on LSD<br /><br />If asked to do some research i would just have a smoke of bush or hash.<br /><br />I am sure some RCs might be good also as they can bring up a wide range of outlook. Not used any myself unless we still class MDMA as a RC.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m just stoned on good honest weed.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br />

				weed + adderall is a very good combo I&#039;ve found. i think that LSD is the best when it comes to writing though, depending on what you&#039;re writing. it just sort of spills out, and what i write on acid always turns out to be particularly cerebral and sort of &quot;tuned in&quot; (best way i can describe it). it&#039;s just stream of conscious anyhow
