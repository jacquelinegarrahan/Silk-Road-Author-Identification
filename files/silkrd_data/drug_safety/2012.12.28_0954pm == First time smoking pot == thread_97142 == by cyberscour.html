				I&#039;m getting some weed off the road in a couple of days. It&#039;s mid-grade stuff, I&#039;m not looking for quality, I&#039;m just looking to try it out and get a feel for it before I buy anything really potent. But how much of it should I smoke, what are some fun things to do when on it, and anything important I should know beforehand? I know weed isn&#039;t really a strong drug like the ecstasy I just took, but I really underestimated ecstasy and it blew me away when I first took it, and I want to know more about what I&#039;m getting into this time...&nbsp; :o

				So you have never tried cannabis ever in the past?<br /><br />If not i would buy some papers and roll a nice joint.<br /><br />Are you trying it with friends or alone?<br /><br />Anyway just have some cool movies to watch and have plenty of munchies for your first time. ;)<br /><br />If its first time smoking bongs, dont drive. ;)<br /><br />Enjoy. :)

				lol i dont mean to put down jnemonics post because a joint for the first time getting high would be great, but it took me forever to roll proper joints that smoke right. its an art indeed 8) <br />cannabis (in my opinion) is THE wonder drug. terence mckenna called it the staff of life =D. there is nothing to be worried about with your first time. it is not really anything like mdma, and its the safest recreational drug known to man. there should be no worries friend.<br />have someone that does know how to roll a joint do it for you. and i would definitely say dont smoke alone your first time, its great for chilling with friends and simply laughing your ass off =)

				I smoked for the first time with my boyfriend. He packed me a hitter, ordered some food, and put on a funny movie. I laughed my ass off on the floor and ate chinese food like I&#039;d been starving for a week. It was a fun time, but don&#039;t expect to drive anywhere. Relax...it&#039;s all good. I&#039;d also not recommend trying to roll a joint the first time. It is an art. Find someone with a hitter or go buy one (or at least a bowl).<br />I will admit, I love my opiates, so it was a definitely different high for me, but after a few times of smoking, I enjoy it. I just had to get used to it...<br />Have fun!!

I remember when the ecstasy was taking effect and I was coming up, I nearly had a panic attack for half an hour lol.

				as soon as you exhale, the effects should be felt. it will be euphoric for maybe an hour or two (hard to remember my first time smoking weed) and you will feel sort of &quot;cloudy&quot; and relaxed for the rest of the day if i remember the effects right haha. i still advise against the joint, rolling a shitty jay is embarassing, you can burn a lot more weed than you intend too without getting an inhalation, and rolling a joint is not the same as rolling a cig. marijuana burns differently and it really can be a pain in the ass

				lol the first time i got high i was 11..... but when i first started my friend told me to hold it in for 10 seconds which definitely works....<br /><br />now ive had moments while tripping that i held a cannabis hit in for as long as possible, and i passed out O_O.<br />fell to the ground, came to with a pain in my chin so i had to have hit it off the ground =/<br />dont suffocate yourself, just hold it in for a bit hahaha<br />and when i first started rolling joints i would double wrap them so they would burn slower, always used to work before i knew how to roll

				Be careful not to whitey. Avoid alcohol. Suck mints. Drink a cup of tea.<br /><br />Use a mild quality cigarette instead of rolling baccy.<br /><br />Use mostly weed cut up fine with scissors, and just a little baccy evenly spread to help it burn. (important for health if you are to hold the smoke in for a long time).<br /><br />Use a good roach. Tight spiral of thin non glossy card is good. People often get neater results rolling with the roach in but takes practice to mach the size of the roach with the thickness of the joint at that end. Place the roach at the left side if you are right handed (or try the other way if you find it easier).<br /><br />after rolling, tap a little but not too tight, poke the end down and smoke.<br /><br />If&nbsp; not rolled tight enough you will get the skin burning unevenly and waste weed.<br />If too tight and / or the weed is damp it will not burn (especially if pure).
