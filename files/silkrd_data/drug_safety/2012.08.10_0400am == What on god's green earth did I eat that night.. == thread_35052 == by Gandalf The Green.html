				Ok so this tale has been told and and again but here goes.<br /><br />420 this year in Canada. To celebrate we pick up some weed cookies (as per our yearly tradition) and go for what we thought would be a nice relaxing trip. We head to our trip destination and on the train we each eat one. By the time we&#039;re half way there we can feel it a bit. Slight buzz. Awkwardness being surrounded by so many people. We don&#039;t talk at all in an attempt to hide the fact that what we&#039;re thinking about is stupid, but eye contact itself is enough to induce the giggles. At this point everything is going just as expected.<br /><br />Finally we get to our destination and it&#039;s time for another cookie. Still feeling the buzz of the first one, after another half an hour things really start to go awry. We are walking in a square building with massive 20 foot ceilings. I say square but it&#039;s actually hollow in the sense that you can just walk around it&#039;s perimeter.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#039;re walking down the hall and we start tripping balls. Looking forward and than backward, it seems like we are stuck in space. We look to the walls next to us and it seems like our position is fixed (despite our legs obviously moving). We discuss this while we walk and it seems like it&#039;s taking forever and ever to reach the end of the hall.<br /><br />Next we sit down (this is where it really kicks in). The body high becomes almost overwhelming here and I&#039;m having trouble supporting the weight of my own head. Next I start to receive texts from friends who are wondering where we are. These texts brought on a strange sense of paranoid panic that I&#039;ve never had before. I started to believe that the texts I was getting were not actually from people I knew, but from a computer (or some device) that was generating these messages and sending them to me. I felt complete disassociation from every other being around me. Only the occasional &quot;Hey how you doing?&quot; from my buddy brought me somewhat back into reality. As we sat there and he tapped his foot on the floor the noise became unbearable. Like it was vibrating my ears off my head.<br /><br />Soon after we decide it&#039;s time to go and we gather enough strength to stand upright. Now outside and exposed to fresh air, both of us walk for about 20 meters before we keel over next to some bushes and vomit what is clearly chocolate chip and mint left over from the cookies.<br /><br />Bag of 10 was for 15$. I blaze no more than a few times a month and have never had any problems or low tolerance.<br /><br />So question is, wtf did I eat? Or was that just some legendary budder.

				What you ate was a very large dose of THC, and you had what we would call a &#039;whitey&#039; in Ireland.<br />All normal, and a very common thing for newbies to good quality cannabis products.

				I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I ate a significant amount of edibles (1/4 oz of decent bud in brownies).&nbsp; We thought we had botched the recipe so i ate my entire share...turns out we didn&#039;t :)

				Wow so that really was just pure THC power? Thanks for the replies guys. Didn&#039;t know edibles could be so potent. Before that trip I had pot brownies a few times before but these were definitely on another level.
